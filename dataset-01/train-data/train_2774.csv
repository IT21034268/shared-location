2,"TOO BAD, SO SAD","I REALLY LIKED THIS BAG WHEN I FIRST SEEN IT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT LOOKED VINTAGE OR WHATEVER, AND IT HAS THE MEDIC CROSS, IAM A NURSING STUDENT SO I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO USE AS A BOOKBAG..THE PROBLEM WAS IT WAS SO MUCH SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT- MY BOOKS DID NOT EVEN FIT INTO IT :( I SENT IT BACK, HOPEFULLY I GET A FULL REFUND AS PROMISED IN THEIR SELLER PROFILE....I WAS REALLY BUMMED ABOUT IT BUT NEXT TIME I SHOULE SEE THE FINE PRINT MORE CAREFULLY REGARDING THE MEASUREMENTS...RALPHIEBOI"
5,Bag!!!,My sister doesn't carry a purse so I got an idea to find a bag she would use and it was not girly. Put patches on it to cover the cross insignia and it is a durable canvas. She will probably have it forever.
4,amazing bag(:,"when i first came across the bag online,i fell in love and went straight to buying it . it was after i got it that i started looking at the reviews and notice a lot of people say how it was way too small,lack of pockets and yada yada . i began to doubt buying it,but then i thought 'man i really want it..for school', so i just kept it . Well, when i got it,yes it does lack pockets which is why i am giving it a four star(aka there are none),but the bag it's self is amazing ! The reviews made it seem tiny and had me wondering what i just bought ? so i found out some inches for you guys who are curious ;The width of the bag is about 3 inches, length is about 10 inches, the height is about 9 inches . I hope this helps,i really would recommend it,i love it and it seems to be holding up nicely with my school supplies(: Though i don't carry much ."
3,Review,"It is a good quality bag, but it is fairly small from what was expected, the receiver of the gift can barely fit his laptop inside it... good but small."
1,Disappointed!,"Turned out to look more like a purse than an over the shoulder messenger's bag! I'm a paramedic and was super excited to bring this to work and look like a huge dork, but it looks so small on my shoulder I'd be too embarrassed to bring it in. Too bad."
4,Medic bag,I really like the bag the only problem I saw was the shoulder strap. I felt it was a little to high on my waist area but was perfect for all the things I need.
3,small- Its unique,"This bag is a lot smaller than i anticipated. It also has absolutely no pockets for anything. It was cheap and I use it when i want something unique but if you are wanting a functional purse this isn't for you. Still i give it an ok rating it has held up pretty well, the material is thick and sturdy"
4,Nice bag,"Nice messenger bag its kinda small but is very portable and feels good.Con it has those belt locks so if you have to take out things very often, it would get very tedious for my opinionstill a great bag buy it you will not regret!!"
5,The reviews are misleading.,"I thought this bag was going to be significantly smaller than it was because of all the reviews saying that it's small, and you can only fit so much in it. Happily, I was able to fit a rather large collection of books and my belongings I transferred over from my regular purse. The strap adjusts easily and I love the vintage feel of the material. Overall, I really enjoy this bag and it's a great addition to my collection. Definitely not as small as the other reviews say! I was able to fit my netbook inside as well, with quite a few other things."
2,"Cute, but not as expected","I purchased this bag to use to create a pretend vet set for my daughter. I plan to fill it with some ""medical supplies"" she can use to care for her stuffed animals. The bag I received does not have the medic cross on the front, which really was a big reason I purchased this particular bag. It is a very cute bag, but now I need to take the time to decorate it so that it is more than just a generic bag. A bit of a disappointment!"
2,attractive bag...poor workmanship,"Got this bag for my son's Red Cross first aid supplies. All he had in it were band-aids, gauze, etc. nothing heavy. He hadn't even taken it outside the house...had it 3-4 days and the rivets that hold the leather straps on the front came off on one side. Returned it. Too bad, cuz it's a really neat looking bag! :o("
2,Bag had no cross,Purchased two bags. One product did not come with cross. The quality is not great with pulled out stitchings on material on both bags.
4,More for fun than functional,"We got this as a present for someone. Upon examination, it was a rather simple bag. Nonetheless, it served as a memorable gift for the recepient. More form than function? It was not a large bag and did not feel substantial, then again, the price should have been a hint. If you are buying it for a medic, doctor, nurse, or historian, it is a nice little gift. But for actual everyday use, it a bit small and flimsy."
5,Nice light weight bag.,Bought this as a gift for a friend in the medical field. It was a hit. Good for small light items.
2,medic bag,"the bag is ok in size. the problem is that shoulder strap is generic. I have seen better strapson 10 dollar back packs at walmart. the closing straps are to flimsi and small, not enough stitching to make them look dorable. it should have snap on connectors or a simple peg and loop. need more padding and stitching at the bottom. eventualy it is going to rip from the bottom unless you just carry bubble wrap or facial tissues. this thing would not last a week in the battle field, you would thin that this was a good army surplus item, but it is not"
4,Works For what I Bought It For,"I needed a Bag to carry around my change of Outfits (work & after work)so that I wouldn't have to lug my clothes around in a plastic bag.I can fit a pair of Jeans, Shirt, make-up bag, lotion, and perfume in this bag, With extra room to throw in a pair of Sandles. The strap is adjustable, I adjusted it all the way to the lowest it could go so there was no extra strap flying around (which is the only negative, which another reviewer has said just to safety pin it down, and that does work), and it reaches below my hip.This bag isnt boxy, it's like tough canvas and it's able to be folded up since there are no things within the bag to shape it besides the items you place inside.I like the leather buckles/straps though; Make the bag look cool.Worked Perfect For me :)"
5,Perfect!,The bag is perfect! It is exactly how described and the size is exactly what I was expecting/needed. This bag is perfect for carrying a netbook and some books with some space to spare. Also the strap is very soft and comfortable. The only thing that I might think as a problem is the buckle straps making accessing whats in the bag slow and a little cumbersome. However that is the authentic look of the bag and it looks really cool and really nice. Glad I bought it!
2,I Expected Better,"I love the appearance of this bag, and it's size was know before I ordered.My complaint is with the structure of the bag. The stitching is poor and the material is thin in the places that count. The high stress areas and joints will need to be stitched before use, and the place where the flap joins the bag is beginning to tear right out of the box.I do not recommend buying this bag unless you intend if for a gag gift."
4,It looks like a purse,"I love the bag! It conveniently fits all of the books i need for school in it perfectly, and it fits comfortably on my shoulder. However I have received some complaints from my piers that it looks like a purse, which is understandable. I am a 6'1"", 260 lb man and this bag does look rather tiny upon my massive body. Given the option to go back in time, I would have purchased a much larger bag."
4,Little smaller then expected,Another bag bought for my daughter. Good quality but not much room inside of the bag. All and all I was happy with it as was my daughter. I would buy again.
3,Way to small,"While the bag does look great, its size is extremely underwhelming. I cannot imagine any school books of any use fitting in it, nor a laptop other than 13"" Macbooks or netbooks fitting into it, as most 13"" PCs have extra case room, it might not fit easily either.Essentially, I have to gift this to a friend and search for a new bag. Again."
3,More like a small purse.,"DOES NOT FIT 15"" LAPTOPS!!!!!I was pretty let down when my macbook didn't fit in it. (might fit a 13"" if you jam it in there)But seriously. I'm pretty disappointed...... I shouldn't have trusted a review that someone left.Read the item description before you buy it."
3,"Like everyone else says, it isn't really a giant bag","If you're looking to quick stow some stuff in a bag and get out of the house, this is your bag. If you have notebooks, maybe a laptop, a tablet, books... I'd say skip it. Looks cool in my room, and when I'm just carrying my tablet around, it would be pretty sweet. It looks awesome, but you get what you pay for."
4,I use it often enough,"It is definitely smaller than expected, however, I found a use for it. It's good for the little outings every once in a while where I don't really need something as big as a backpack. I usually use it to dump my phone, iPod, wallet, and other things into. It is semi-usable for school though. It can't fit much though; I can only fit my small Lenovo ThinkPad Edge (13in) and a small thin notebook as well as a small thin pencil case."
2,Size,"The picture of the bag makes it look much larger than it actually is, dont be fooled. Also it is folded in plastic so you have to open it to see how big it is and then cannot return it."
2,Too Small,"This was way smaller than I thought it would be from the picture, I can't really use it to carry books in as I had planned. It also seems to be made of cheap, flimsy material."
2,Very small,This bag is not as big as it looks in the picture. It is not big enough to hold a small laptop.
3,Not worth the money,"As expected from reading the other reviews, the bag's maximum capacity is about two textbooks. It looks much cooler in the picture then it does in person. I would suggest looking into a bigger, more durable bag unless you know this is exactly what you're looking for."
4,Very Sturdy.,"The bag is fantastic. It's very sturdy, and has that great vintage look. It's best if you don't wash it for a while, and get it a little dirty.I use it from everything such as sneaking candy into the movies and taking books on long road trips.The only downside I can think of it also occasionally, a boon. The bottom isn't sturdy, but rather hangs out to be rounded whenever the heavy things are in it. Great for lightweight, daily use."
4,nice!,Could be a tad bit bigger or at least have some extra pockets but it gets the job done.I mainly use it for when i go geocaching.
4,Good price,I think it is very good price for NAC. I am taking NAC for depression - I think it helps a little. I will continue to take. I would say if you have depression or bipolar it is good supplement to take.
3,Recommended by doctor,I started taking this supplement because of a recommendation by my doctor. She had read an article about NAC being a possible treatment for certain psychiatric disorders. So far NAC hasn't helped. I'm thinking about continuing the supplement with an increase in the dosage to see if I notice a difference.
2,Doubtful Results,"Gave me a bad headache! Stopped taking it for a few days, started taking it again and the headache came back. No thanks!"
1,Were's the warning?,"Wheres the warning that says yeah it will neutralize, acetamiphen but will cause kidney stones, if you don't take crazy amounts of vitamin c"
5,Cut My Cravings!,I was binge eating almost every night! The first afternoon I took the pill it stopped! This product is really Amazing!
1,Bad mojo for me,I wish this product didn't cause me severe intestinal distress. They use it for counter-acting the poisonous effects of excessive acetaminophen. (Good thing I don't have that problem.)I was surprised. I don't usually react that dramatically to anything.
3,NAC,"This product, N-Acetyl Cysteine was recommended to me by my pulmonologist's therapist. I have several lung diseases and I needed to cough up congestion that settled in my lungs. I can't afford to get sick. So she recommended I take this. I couldn't find it in town any place. Nobody knew what I was talking about. So my husband suggested I check the internet and I found it at Amazon.com. The pills work great for the purpose intended, BUT after I started taking them they began to bother my stomach. Maybe they are too strong for me. Or maybe I don't need them now. They give me a burning sensation going from my stomach up into my throat. I'm finishing the bottle this week then I'll call the therapist and tell her about my problem. Amazon's price and delivery is fantastic! Thank you."
2,"Looks great, but...","A friend of mine bought this for me as a gift, and it looks great. Unfortunately, the bottle opener isn't well designed. I found this out by trying to force open a bottle of Guinness. In spite of the fact that I had the opener in the correct position, I ended up breaking the neck of the bottle instead of taking off the lid. I have had this same problem with other bottles, although I've had the good sense not to apply that much pressure again! So while the rest of the set is useful, I just keep the bottle opener out for looks and use an ugly old one I keep in a kitchen drawer. Sigh."
1,Looks and feels cheap,"This set of tiny tools is a rip-off. It looks and feels cheap with all the handles made of cheap plastic. You can clearly see the bumps on both sides of the jigger. That shows you the craftsmanship, or lack of it to be correct. I guess the formula now is to give a fancy european name to a lousy product and put it on the Internet with a hefty price. Buyers have no idea of its actual size just by looking at the picture. Also few people want to go through the hassle to return stuff purchased online. Stay away, you have been warned."
2,Constant Err Mesage,Constantly having to fiddle with the stupid magnetic power cord. Heats for about 3 minutes and gives Err message unless cord is miraculousy aligned by scientist at MIT.
2,"Initially Good, Major Issues Developed","Initially, I really liked this fryer. It was my second deep fryer, and my first deep fryer with an immersion heating element. It worked great at first, but it did take a long time for the oil to heat up. Given the quantity of oil, I figured that was acceptable. The advantage was the oil would maintain temperature during cooking.After about 6 months of use, the sensor to ensure that the heating element is properly installed began to malfunction. Furthermore, it started going into an error mode where the display only reads ""Err"". After a while, the sensor had to be manually wedged into place so that it would function and the error mode eventually started to happen almost every time I plug it in."
1,Impractical design,We returned this fryer for several reasons. The magnet that is supposed to hold the power cord is so poorly attached that it falls for any motion or shock to the unit. Simply shaking fries in the basket is sufficient to dislodge the power cord. That implies restarting not only the temperature setup but also the timer (who needs a timer instead of a visual inspection !).The second reason is the unintuitive process. One does not plug and fries but a series of temperature and timers have to be set then started. Overall the design does not appear to have been supervised by someone who grew up frying French fries.
2,Love it but it keeps breaking,I love the functionality of this armband. The problem is that it keeps breaking. The place at which the band loops through the holder keeps breaking.. I'm on my second one and it is almost ready for another replacement...
2,Battery will not hold charge,"I didn't mind it at first. It feels cheap, but it worked ok. Now a few months later, the battery will not hold a charge. I can't even use it plugged in because it's like the battery keeps charging & discharging & it loses connection all the time. It's horrible."
1,trash,"dont buy this junk, you have been warned.ok first off, the accuracy with this controller is ZERO. i have been playin BFBC online and COD4in BFBC, using the noob gun: the NS2000 in close range i still cant land a hit. this controller just sux! , i ended up tossing it so hard in rage it broke and i had to return ityea the vibration is more powerfull than the dualshock3 and nyko will return it no questions asked i it messes up (before a year has passed) but these are the only pros. the plate covers do cool up fast and it is heavy to hold (nice feel to it) but the buttons mess up quick the analog sticks wont get stuck like the dualshocks but they have No accuracy in them, only buy it for RTS and strategy games/RPGthe l1/r1 buttons are hard to press and the l2/r2 take more force to press.if you have any questions, my youtube is ""soldercyfix"""
1,Be very careful,"I purchased two of these last week, and they arrived a few days ago. The first one started giving me random directional inputs almost immediately. The second one lasted a few hours of play, and then began giving me random circle inputs.I know that people have used these controllers and enjoyed them, but I apparently got two duds. My advice: If you are cheap enough (like me) to purchase these, use them extensively as soon as you get them. If you are lucky you'll discover any issues early so that you can get them exchanged or send them back.If Nyko customer service doesn't get back to me on Monday, these are both going back to Amazon."
4,Not bad at all once you give it a chance.,"I first purchased two Nyko Zero Wireless controllers months ago, and I tried out it once, and threw it to the side. About a week ago, I went downstairs to my second PS3 setup and was too lazy to walk upstairs to grab the DualShock 3 so I just plugged in the Nyko Zero Wireless controller.While playing Madden 09, I was getting frustrated but after about 5 minutes of play, I actually got used to the controller. It actually feels quite nice and I like how L2 and R2 are designed like actually triggers.Although I like it, I don't prefer it over the DualShock 3 or SixAxis controllers. But I would recommend it to customers looking for an extra controller or two at a lower cost."
1,Mis-Represented,"This controller is comfortable and has a play & charge cable that is 6 inches longer than the Microsoft xbox 360 controllers that is all it has going for it.As you can see in the photo it is supposed to be black with silver on the handles. It is all black.It is supposed to have VIBRATION in the photo you can see a button labeled ""VIB"" VIB = VIBRATION!No Vibration.The CES 2008 interview with NYKO says this controller has vibration!It is not staying connected to the wireless dongle very long."
1,Cheap Substitute,I bought these when they were 12 bucks.They are horrible! They eat AA batteries like crazy. Most of all they need to stay plugged in 100% of the time if you use the rechargeable battery in the box.They only should be bought if you have a USB hub or a 4 port PS3 (Each one takes 2 spots (one to charge and one for the 2.4 Mhz Wireless)I am now going to by some real sony controllers to replace these.The VIBRATION IS USELESS!
3,"Decent for some purposes, not so good for others.","This controller is not the worst 3rd party controller you can get, but it certainly isn't the best. Here are some pluses and minuses I had about it.The Good.-it was only [...], less than half the price of a Dualshock 3-The aluminum top piece does do the job it's intended to do-rumble-Better-suited R2 and L2 buttons than the Dualshock 3-10 foot recharging cable!-Interchangeable batteries too!The Bad.-The controller feels weird in my hands, I don't know if it's just me, but it did not feel right when playing GTA IV.- The L1 and R1 buttons are too big, and they are hard to press in certain situations-The D-pad isn't as good as on the Dualshock 3Bottom Line.To some people, it may be worth it. To others, it may not. If your just looking for a controller for a bud to play, this one will do the job. If this is going to be the mainstay of your PS3 for the rest of it's life, then you might want to reconsider."
3,Looks good plays bad!,"First off I wanna say this controller looks awesome I mean Its just beautiful. I just wish that It worked as good as the Dualshock. The L1 And R1 buttons are not really easy to press when needed to press quickly, and the little usb stick lost connections every five minutes and my controllor just shut off, so now I just use the USB cable, GET A DUALSHOCK!"
4,"good, but not great","The controller is a good one,but it is a little tight at first. Its bigger than the ps3 controller, but still not big enough. When i hold it i seem to be keepping my wrist in a wierd position. After awhile it just isn't that comfortable. If your used to a XBOX controller its better but not the same. overall i think its a good controller, but not great"
3,"A cheap substitute, no more, no less","I got this controller because I needed a second one. The original sony ps3 costs a lot than more thus this controller becomes more attractive.Pros: Cheap alternative(paid [...]USD), feels sturdy(top metal frame), offers alternative power source (using AA batteries), long USB cable (helpful when you need to charge and play at the same time)Cons: Does not feel ergonomic, the edges feel uncomfortable on the palms, If you have smaller hands, the L1/R1 with respect to L2/R2 felt like it is spaced a lot farther than compared to the sony's controller.Overall, if you need a cheap second controller, I would recommend this. But for use in a longer gameplay, you probably want the sony contoller."
1,This controller really is aweful.,"The Pro's:It is comfortable.The Cons:It doesnt switch on your PS3.The D-Pad feels like its going to fall off.The Analogue triggers dont work 100%.Item is not as pictured by Amazon.The Analogue sticks are slow responding.I bought 2 controllers and both have exactly the same problems.Now I've been burned twice by NYKO. And what frustrates me more is that I was stupid enough to believe that this could of been a good product.Buy genuine Sony, even Logitech. Ive never had a problem with them."
1,don't buy,The controller work for an little while for about three weeks then stop working. Save your money buy the ps3 controller the one sony makes.
1,"Ok at first, but then....","I ignored the negative reviews of this product and let the cheap price sway me to buy them. That was a mistake. Although they did work ok for a couple of weeks and worked just fine because I have young kids that didn't care if the were the best every made, but unfortunately after those two weeks the controllers both started to act up. They would lose connection, some buttons would work and some wouldn't and then they were just useless.Don't let the price blind you like it did me.Bill"
1,Rubbish,"I got this since I am no big fan of the siaxis controller but rather miss my xbox controlers.At the time this seemed like a decent alternative but then one of the control sticks just snapped, I wasnt even putting that much force on it (was hiding under a table at a stripclub shooting at some cops) and still it snapped right off. Another thing, there is a big red infrared dongle that is a never ending hassle to conect in order to get the controler working...My advice: DO NOT BUY THIS CONTROLER!And if you still think you want it at least try your luck with the silver one, course the black one (the one I got) does NOT have the rumble function (the silver one has a button on the pic that say VIB. on it, that button does not exist on the black controler).I would wait for a different alternative to the siaxis instead."
2,Unstable Connection,"These controllers would have been great except for the fact that they don't stay connected to my PS3. Good size, wireless, solid feel, and a low price... sigh... almost perfect. I bought 3 ""Playstation 3 Zero Wireless Controllers"" and all of them have the same problem. I also have one official PS3 controller that came with my Playstation and it has no problems staying connected. I wish the Zero controllers gave you the option to connect with wires in the hopes that the connection would be more reliable. But, the USB connection seems to be for charging only. I can't believe I'm saying this but they really weren't event worth the <$5 I paid for them."
2,Doesn't Perform,"This was my dream come true for the playstation: a controller not designed to fit a five foot three japanese guy!! It looks pretty cool, and feels a lot like a 360 controller with more grip; my excitement shrouded my better thinking until the day came when i put myself out of my misery and destroyed it.Unacceptable Terrible Qualities of this Controller:1: The ""re-chargeable"" battery wouldn't so i had to use AA.2. You have to occupy a usb port while using this controller3. I coulnd't sync to the ps3 with out the usb plug4. The Sticks are un-sensitive to the point where aiming is improbable: either sluggish movement, or all the way fast.5. The buttons (epecially R1 L1) stick on the regular, but that can be fixed with (sparse amounts of) oil.so this thing felt great but sucked big time. Pretty much worthless considering you can get a generic wired ps3 controller for around ten bucks."
1,Stay away from it,"I bought this controller brand new off Amazon. I think the controller would have been 1/2 decent, but the controller won't charge (left on the PS3 for 5+ hours). It isn't worth paying the shipping to send it back, so I'm pretty much stuck with it. You pretty much get what you pay for, so I guess I should complain too much (only out 20 bucks). It would have been nice if it actually charged. The next step is seeing if rechargeable batteries work better. Save your money and just buy a better quality controller."
1,Nyko poor customer service,"Nyko controller for PS3 have a amazing design very sophisticated and attractiveFor everything else i do not recommend it, because batteries die in seconds (just after unppluged controller from the USB cord) so this disadvantage turns the Nyko wireless in wire controllerPlus i try to contact them through the nyko website(customer support)several times but they never reply to my messages also i called few time they send me directly to the automatic answering machine where i have to leave my name,phone number, and the reason why i call them..., they never call me back, they never care about it...poor,poor customer service"
2,the Batteries,don't buy this contoller the batteries die in 30 min bye a real ps3 controller the batteries last 2 to 3 days
4,Good alternative if you don't Sony's PS3 controller,"First things firsts, for all you people who are complaining that it doesn't turn on the PS3 system need to be quiet, GET UP AND TURN THE SYSTEM ON YOURSELF ITS REALLY NOT THAT HARD. Anyways the controller works well and if you don't like PS3's controller and enjoy holding a 360 controller more than you should like using this one. The d-pad is pretty loose but it still works fine. I would not recommend buying this for more than $[...] since you can get a regular PS3 one for less. I got two from ebay, one was $[...] and the other was $[...]. So give ebay a look."
2,"Yuck, I almost threw up looking at this piece of","I just received this controller and man....it's officially delegated as the back-up controller for the PS3! I mean, even the 2nd broken one has priority over this!It reminded me of a 360 controller. I held it in my big hands and noticed something - the buttons are small! I was shocked because it's such a huge controller! I could barely get used to the L2/R2 L1/R1.The design is garbage. I give Nyko a hand clap for giving me not only a rechargable battery back but also a possibility for just 2 AA batteries...but man, they should have just finished the job and made this for the 360!This controller(s) *I bought 3* is perfect for extra guests. You hand it to them to let them know they're in your home. Or, you use these controllers and hurt their feelings. Or, you use these yourself when your Sony controller finally gives out.This would get a 1 star, but I bought them for [...] dollars a piece!"
2,Uses precious USB port on your PS3,"The controller is bigger than original Sony controller, but handles are made in such a way that is seems that hands are close to each other.This controller is not bluetooth controller and hence uses precious USB port, the new PS3's have only 2 USB ports and hence using one for controller is limiting.I got one from amazon for [...] bucks, its good for that much money for anything more, I would rather pay extra and get sony bluetooth controller."
4,Good controller with rumble,"This is a nice full featured controller with rumble. However, it uses a USB dongle instead of Bluetooth. The connection works well most of the time, but when using two of these at once the connection dropped out at random intervals. By adding a USB hub, which put the two dongles further appart, I was able to get two controllers to work at the same time without the drop outs.One other annoying issue is that if you want to charge the controller while playing, then you have to use two USB ports: one for the dongle and one for the wire to charge the controller. The controller will not work with just the wire -- the wire is only for charging.Overall it's a nice controller if you can get it at the right price. It has a different shape than the Sony controller, so I expect that some people will prefer this one to Sony's and vice versa."
2,NYKO Zero Wireless Controller for PS3,"This was a great deal for $[...] during the time of the sale. I was in need of a second controller if the time arose when I have a friend over and we want to play a 2-player game.The controller feels VERY different compared to the DualShock3 controller from Sony, and it takes some getting used to. Like I mentioned, it was a great deal for only $[...] at the time, so I at least have a back-up controller if my DS3 ever breaks.I would not purchase this item at regular price... it just doesn't feel comfortable holding it. The triggers feel too close, and the face buttons are too high up on the controller, so it feels like you have to stretch your fingers to reach them. This is probably due to the long ""arms"" which you grip in your hands, as they are longer when compared to the DS3 controller."
2,OK Controller - BAD rechargeable battery,"Although the controller is not as ""solid"" as the Sony one's, as noted by other reviewer's, they are bigger, and may work better for adult-sized hands. However, the USB recharger and link, and the rechargeable battery packs are really poor - I am using mine with rechargeable alkalines."
4,Great Buy,I bought 3 of these when they were on sale for $[...]. I already own 2 sixaxis and 1 DS3. They were a great buy. I love the fact you can use 2 AA batteries (for those who dont have long USB cable) or a rechargeable battery. It comes with a pretty long USB cable but the cable only works with this controller and not the official ps3 controllers. The only con's I see are the fact it is not Blue Tooth. So those with only 2 USB ports will have to use one up if you wana plug one in. I suggest buying a Nyko media hub (2 usb ports and memory card slots). My ps3 has 4 usb slots so this was not a problem even if I wanted to run all 3 controllers at the same time. The white looks amazing and all 3 of mine came with rumble. Great Product!
4,Must have for big people.,"I am a big guy - 6'3"" @ 220lbs - and the original ps3 controllers are too small for my hands and feel of cheap plastic anyway. I have been searching for a replacement controller and have found an exceptional one in Nyko's Zero. It is sturdier and larger than original and makes for more comfortable game play with my oversized mitts. It has full functionality, including tilt-axis, EXCEPT for being able to turn on PS3 remotely; I use the bluetooth bluray remote control for that - problem solved :)My one gripe being that its still not big enough :( This is definitely an adult sized controller, I just have really big hands.Bottom line: if you have big hands that occasionally get sweaty ... this is the controller you need for PS3!"
1,Break quickly,I bought two of these. One of them was the model with vibration and the other without. Both of them lost the ability to recharge their battery packs making them no longer usable as wireless controllers and even when they are wired they still can lose their connection. I emailed Nyko customer service about this and I never received any response. Not only that but the other Nyko product I bought also broke with light use in just 2 months. Stay away from these even if they are on sale for cheap.
3,Great Ergonomics... Poor Electronics,"This controller has great ergonomics. I am not a big guy, but I am a grown up. The PS3 controllers are made for kids under 13yrs... If I am playing a racing game that uses both the trigger buttons and the shaped buttons (ala MotorStorm) my fingers are cramped with the stock/six-axis PS3 controller. This Nyko controller is great when it comes to ergonomics. The finish is great, has the rumble (black controller), and PS3 button. Now the bad news: Battery stopped working after a month, so I had to connect it to a USB port while using the controller. Recently, the controller left analog stick stopped working, making it useless. I wish Sony made their controllers with similar ergonomics."
2,Pay extra and get a Sony Dualshock 3,"At first the controller worked decently and I enjoyed the rumble since this was before the Dualshock 3 came out.After a couple of months of owning it, the battery pack no longer recharged, so I had to leave the controller hooked up to the ps3 the whole time. This defeated the purpose of the wireless controller and since the usb dongle took up a second port, it was extremely annoying. If you have a ps3 slim, it would occupy all of your usb ports if this problem happened to you.Also after a couple of months, it very often, disconnected from the usb dongle, so I had to pause my game and press buttons on the controller and the usb dongle to reconnect the device. It often took a very long time and is very inconvenient.Others might not have this problem but mine had these after a few months. Unless you get the controller on a huge sale (I got mine for $15 on black friday I believe), I would definitely put in the extra money and invest in a Sony branded controller."
4,Great controller for normal hands,"I had been searching for a controller similar to the xbox 360 and this the closest that I've found. It has no lag, the battery is ok, not great, but the fit for my hands is fantastic. I found that sometimes it's a pain to have the cord plugged into my PS3 when I'm playing so I put my laptop next to me and plug it into that and it will charge while I play my PS3. Overall I liked it enough to buy 2."
1,This controller is a no-go for any COD players!,"I would not purchas this controller for any COD game. Take all the negatives from the reviews above, and add in unrefined, unreliable, and unusable!"
2,forces you to abandon old skills,"if you are trying to use it for FPS games, don't think about itthere are problems in both the analog (used it with PES 2009 > no precision at all) and sticks (stiff, its hard to move the crosshairs smoothly in COD world at war)the only good thing is the price ...."
1,No Rumble,I bought this controller because it was listed as having Rumble. When I got it it did not have the feature because it's an older generation model according to NYCO's website so be careful what you buy.
1,Awful,"Do not buy this controller, period. It simply does not work. Although the controller is built well and is sturdy, the problem is the USB dongle. It constantly loses its connection with the controller, and you can't play for more than about 30 seconds without having to reset the entire apparatus. Obviously, this makes it completely useless for playing games.In addition, the battery on my controller never worked right from the outset. It states up to 27 hours of uninterrupted power, but on my unit the charge would run out after 10-20 minutes. I had to use the controller with a USB cord connected to my ps3 at all times, and even then I could only use it for about 30 seconds before the connection would get interrupted. By the way, there is no customer support and no way to get a refund. Buy a sony controller and do not waste money on this, or you will regret it!"
1,NOT the greatest controller in the world,I bought this thing because my brother-in-law had one and he said it was great for Tiger Woods Golf because the left joystick was so stiff it would deliver a perfect swing. I think what happened was he just ended up getting a one in a million controller that had a beneficial malfunction because the one I got sucked at it. The infra red wirless remote thing sucks too. My PS3 is in an entertainment center with an opague glass. The infra red receptor doesn't always pick up the signal through the opaque glass and I can't leave it open because I have a 3 year old daughter who doesn't realize the difference between a PS3 and a beachball yet (But she is still my Li'l Angel). In my opinion you'd be much better off sticking with the Sony wireless controller.
1,Terrible Amazon return service,"This product does not even work. It would never link to my PS3 after countless try. When I called the service center to try to find out what was going on, it always went straight to voice mail. I never even heard of any customer service would let you leave voice mail!!!! So, I decided to return it and I followed Amazon's return instruction, and till this day almost 1 month later, I haven't seen my refund yet. ""Good job"" Amazon for allowing yourself to sell such a crappy product and can't even do your refund service right."
1,Not even if it's free,"A terrible book, poor editorship, shoddy research, biased conclusions. That just about sums up what this book is all about."
2,it's ok,"It has a good amount of entries, but they do not include all four principle parts with the latin words."
4,Cassell's Latin English dictionary paperback,"I gave this as a gift to two friends. The book was in excellent condition. Although I prefer the hardbound version, the paperback was fine as was the price."
3,Limited,"I bought this dictionary along with the Bantam Latin-English, Engish-Latin dictionary. Of the two, I found that the Bantam dictionary was the better. There have been a few times when I've tried looking up a word in the Cassell's dictionary and not found it, only to find it in the Bantam dictionary. If you're going to purchase a Cassell's Latin dictionary then the hardcover edition is the better buy. Otherwise I would recommend getting the Bantam dictionary."
1,How disappointing...,"For more years than I care to count, I have used Cassell's Latin/English, English/Latin Dictionary, published by Funk & Wagnall's, New York. I looked on the verso of the title page for the publication date, but found only the notation ""339th thousand""--- no date anywhere in sight. I do know I bought it (used) in 1953, so, although a ""Revised Edition,"" it's certainly not what one would call ""new."" When I saw that a new edition had made its way into print, I immediately ordered it. Verdict? It's dreadful. Many, many significant words omitted, definitions askew, tenses turned on their heads. I am remiss in giving it a one star rating, yet your directions say I must fill in that field. This dictionary is VERY VERY disappointing."
5,Excellent for Latin students of all levels!,"This Latin-English dictionary contains definitions of Latin words as they were used during the Roman Civilizations height: 200 BCE-100 CE. A necessary and perfect companion for anyone translating Ovid, Vergil, etc. I also used the Oxford Latin-English Dictionary. The two used together help make translating easier and more enjoyable."
2,"Elementary, not advanced","I have used this dictionary for several years as a high school Latin student and it worked well enough as long as I didn't need to be very precise. Now working more in-depth as a classics major and reading Vergil in particular, I have become very disillusioned with it and am planning on purchasing a new one. It works for elementary Latin, but leaves out too much for advanced work. The printing quality is also poor."
5,Best set of blades to own!,"I have played cavity back irons since I started golf and finally making the transition to the M675s was the best help for my game. The pitching wedge through 7 iron and traditional blade style and the 2-6 are a different type of blade. The longer irons almost feel like you're hitting a driving iron and the launch angle of these clubs is phenomenal. As far as workability goes, GET CREATIVE. You'll be able to hit any shot you choose. The clubhead is fairly small however, so they will take some time getting used to. Lastly, these clubs look very classy. You'll have everyone gawking at the clubhouse over your clubs."
4,Refreshing Take,This is a good book for those who are looking for a refreshing Christian perspective that goes beyond some of myths perpetuated by groups such as Focus on the Family. I recommend this book.
2,"""Traditional"" Families Challenged","In his book, ""The Christian Family in Changing Times,"" Robert Hicks challenges every notion that a ""traditional"" family exists in the Bible or in life. He suggests that the common notion of family is only a myth. He challenges the nature of ""roles"" in relationships and goes as far as to say that although there are many contributors to a child's success or failure, none of them have to do with the family.While I do beleive he does a good thing by getting the reader to think seriously about the myths of family, he goes overboard in his dramatic questioning of every commonly held notion of what it means to be family."
5,High pressure brass orifice for the bg10 burner from Bayou,Works perfect in a bayou bg10 high pressure burner. Between the two you get a perfect clear blue flame and a bunch of BTUs. All I did was adapt from my 1/2 inch black pipe to the 3/8 flare fitting and it worked like a charm.
5,Advanced treatment for lagrangian mechanics enthusiasts,Very nice presentation of subject matter with right balance of exercises (if only there were some worked out solutions or more detailed hints). Sufficient coverage of varied topics to suit taste of most applications oriented readers. The theory side is presented very clearly to help aid deeper understanding for later topics. Book is not for beginners though - reader should have good grasp of undergraduate classical mechanics before tackling this paperback. Overly extensive set of references unless your into history of all(hundreds) of contributors to this branch of mechanics. Very good supplement if continuing on to study for an advanced degree in physics or applied mathematics.
3,Childrens Book,"This book has good illustration, but a week story. I would not recommend it for a very young child as it is just not interesting enough to keep them wanting to hear more."
5,Excellent boresnake,"I normally use the Hoppe's brand boresnakes, but this one is just as good. Not much to describe, it does what it's supposed to do: clean the bore after 2 passes."
1,too loose,"If you buy a Knockout rope cleaner in any size make sure you check it as soon as it arrives. I used this one for the first time more than 90 days after purchase and it was too loose to do any good. After 90 days SSI will not do anything for you, it is yours even if it is wrong. Maybe the packers in China put the wrong one in the box. In any case it is unusable to me, my fault for not checking it right away but I expected better customer support. I really like my .30 and .22 SSI rope cleaners but I don't think I'll be purchasing anymore of their products."
5,RPG in the old style,"I found Fire Emblem to embody a lot of what the early RPG's great, strong plot with likeable characters and smooth linear storyline. I liked how you could recruit people as you went along and losing them for good if they died added a new dimesion of strategy and realism to this title."
5,Excellent treatment of research on color vision & language,"An outstanding edited collection that summarizes the state of research on the linkages among visual neurophysiology and neuropsychology, color perception, color categories, and color naming. Although the emphasis is on the integration of contemporary opponent process theories of color vision and findings from the World Color Survey (WCS) of color terms in a large sample of languages, the volume is unusual in its inclusion of a range of positions, including researchers who strongly question the methods and initial conclusions of the WCS. Several of the individual papers in the collection are among the best brief, clear, and rigorous treatments of important topics in the physiology, psychology, and linguistics of color. The book as a whole is superb case study in how research evolves, in science generally, and in cognitive science more specifically. Advanced undergraduate to graduate level."
2,the topic is interesting but the approach a dead-end,"The subject clearly is an interesting one: colour, thought and language: how are they connected? Do we percieve colours differently? However, this book is based on Berlin and Kay's approach. In the lates 60s these two scientists suggested that societies acquire colur terms in a certain order. First, a distinction between black and white is made. Red comes next, then blue or green and so on. However, as research findings came in, Berlin and Kay's model had to be changed continously to accomodate new facts. By now it is so complex that it is hardly a model at all. Furthermore, it might have been the case that the scholar's own views influenced their thesis.Rather than admit they are mistaken the model was kept and twisted around. Lucy's article at the end of the book clearly shows the fallacy of their approach. All the other articles, however, are based on Berlin and Kay's approach and thus rather worthless."
3,NOT MY FAVORITE LASSWELL BOOK. . .,"The gals beloved home in their San Diego junkyard has burned to the ground and they must make ends meet by cooking for a charter boat. This is the fifth book in the ""Suds"" series and it is just not up to the caliber of the first three books. Is it the innocence that is missing?""Suds in Your Eye"" was written in 1942 and this book in 1953. . maybe the three ladies are better suited to the WWII era."
4,Tooner Schooner,"For anyone who likes Mary Lasswell, they will enjoy this story also. It ranks along with 'Suds in Your Eye' and 'High Times.'"
5,THE best summary of Wesley for the casual reader.,"This is the best, simple summary of John Wesley's life and beliefs I have seen. It reads like a novel, with plenty of references to Wesley's confrontations with the establishment, his passion and his prolific work springing from his faith. I used this extensively in my doctoral dissertation, and have quoted Lean in my efforts to restore Wesleyan values to United Methodism"
3,Many of the reviews were right,"I just got this machine and many of the reviews are right on. Makes a great cup of joe...but has some problems. First my frother leaks constantly. It is worst when the machine is actually brewing the espresso. Secondly, it only has space for small cups. If you want to use the tall feature you must use a short, wide glass. A standard mug just won't fit.I am returning mine today after a day of use and have not decided if I am going to replace it with the same machine or not.I would exchange if I can be guaranteed that the new machine will not leak...but there are no guarantees."
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered this machine to replace a four year old Starbucks Barista machine that was giving out. The specs, reviews, and price all seemed good. To sum up my experience with this machine, I sent it back the day after I got it. It wouldn't produce a decent shot, it leaked around the portafilter, and water dripped constantly from the steaming wand. To [Amazon.com's] credit, they took it back without any problems. I think I see why it is half-price. I replaced it with a Rancilio Silvia and couldn't be happier."
3,A great little machine with poor customer support,"The machine makes great coffee quickly and easily, with either pods or grinds. The auto-shut off feature is very handy. The pressure is sufficient to produce nice foamed milk.However....The machine arrived missing parts.Amazon customer service, when they answered my e-mail (can&#65533;t contact them any other way) two weeks later, was clueless in resolving the problem; however, Briel sent the part within a week without any hassles.The steam valve leaks water; this means that every time I brew coffee it dribbles. I sent the machine in for a warranty-covered repair. Two months later it was returned with the water reservoir cracked and the steam valve still leaking. I have resigned myself to a wet kitchen counter top.If you don't mind the lack of customer support when something goes wrong, and the dribbling, it's a great little machine."
4,Looks Great but...,"First of all, this machine is gorgeous! It's heavy and solidly built. And it makes a really good cup of esspresso. But...I had the same problem some others are having in that the steam nozzel spits out quite a bit of water before it actually starts steaming. If you like the machine enough, and are willing to overlook this minor nuisance, you'll need to let the steam nozzle spit out the water into the tray BEFORE putting you cup of milk under it (otherwise you're going to have very watery milk!) The machine also arrived with just the stainless steam wand but no black plastic turbo nozzle."
1,Great espresso when it works,"I have been making espresso at home for 8 years. Seven of it with a Krups machine - it still won't break. I decided to get a higher line model to handle parties and the fact that more people in my household drink espresso now. It produces espresso that you would get at a fine Italian restaurant. The process is very quick and easy. The problem lies with the reliability of the unit. I have sent the unit back once to Briel to fix a major problem. At four months the machine would only make hot water. Hot water instead of espresso would come out. Regardless of what senting I put for the coffee grinds, hot water with a little bit of coffee would come out. I had to send the unit back at my cost for shipping. It returned three weeks later working again. Two months later, it did the same thing! I'm now considering the money I spent on the unit a total loss and will buy an espresso maker from another company."
3,A great little machine with poor customer support,"The machine makes great coffee quickly and easily, with either pods or grinds. The auto-shut off feature is very handy.

I have resigned myself to a wet kitchen counter top.If you don't mind the lack of customer support when something goes wrong, and the dribbling, it's a great little machine."
2,ES200 APG model design problems,"I purchased this pump expresso machine as replacement unit. This was my 3rd machine. I was very impressed with its reach look. Performance however was dissapointing. I returned it after week of use due to steam valve leak. We could not shut off frothing steam valve entirely loosing steam and pressure. In my opinion there are 2 serious design flows:A. Steam valve nozzle can not be moved over drip pan, therefore any drop of milk ends up on the counter. This is the first machine I saw designed that way.B. Steam valve knob is so smooth that with little wet fingers it is almost impossible to close it firm.Operational problem:On the front of the unit there is the clever coffee volume adjustment slide. The problem was the volume from cup to cup was very inconsistent and sometimes coffee overflown cup."
3,Good Coffee but it leaks water,"Just got my machine and although it makes good coffee , there is a considerable leak of water coming out of the steam nossle. I am returning it and hope to get a replacement (same model) soon."
3,"Good machine, but not worth the money","This is my 3rd machine in the 13 years I've been making my own espresso. It wasn't worth the amount of money it cost me. I did get a lot of use out of it. At first it worked just fine. So I guess I got my money's worth. The brew head is very hard to get to. The brew head is way too hard to clean and leaks no matter how much or how little amount of coffee I use. The machine leaks water a lot now. My main complain with the machine, the brew head is not good. For the amount of money this machine costs, it should be better."
2,Nice try...,If you know anything about the art of pulling a shot of espresso -- forget this machine. The ESE adapter is junk. If you like quick poor shots this machine will produce.
2,Not worth the $$$$,"This machine's instructions are awful. There is almost no explanation of anything. A 7 year old could write a better manual. After starting the machine is is noisy and vibrates like a tin can when operating. The machine is also impossible to adjust for the exact cup size. It also leaks water after it stops brewing, now I know why the drip pan can hold so much. It leaks more with the ESE pods than regular grinds. The flavor is good but is is just not worth the money. Most likely sending it back ASAP."
2,Poor execution,"Lovely looking machine with great promise, but it has not performed reliably. Sometimes it does not pump enought water, most times the foamer leaks while coffee is being made. We are returning it. We will try another one, but the one we started with was certainly a lemon. Plus, the customer help line was not very helpful."
2,Not Worth ...,"I was very excited when I ordered this machine. My excitement, however, was short-lived. The lights didn't work, the coffee was never hot and the machine leaked horribly. I finally decided to return it and purchase the Briel Cadiz, which is by far a superior machine (and about $150.00 less than this one!).I probably got a lemon, but my other briel machine that I bought to replace this one works great!"
2,"Briel makes good espresso, doesn't last.","I was persuaded to this particular machine largely because you described it as a ""workhorse."" I'm the only cappucino drinker in my household, but I like to have it twice a day. I also like my appliances to be dependable, durable, and more powerful than I really need, just so I don't have to baby them along.It worked fine for three weeks. Then it started to spew steam and water, and now grounds, copiously all over the counter--and now all over the kitchen. Water pours out freely during heating. And now, the amount of grounds in the finished coffee is much too high.I have left a voice mail with repair people at AABREE. I will keep you posted on how that works out."
4,A few minor shortcomings but well worth buying,I purchased a Briel ES200APG several months ago and am quite happy with its performance. The machine has a good solid look and feel and produces wonderful espresso. My only criticisms are that the no drip feature should more properly be called reduced drip and I would like to have the espresso a little hotter. If you are looking for a good espresso machine with professional looks and performance I would highly recommend purchasing one of these.
1,Don't buy this machine,"I used to own a chain of coffee shops and am very familiar with professional espresso machines. I wanted a Christmas present for a friend. I didn't have much experience with the ""home use"" machines, but after looking at everything, I decided this one was the best of a bad lot. Actually, none of them except the La Pavoni Europiccola are any more than worthless toys that will break within a year. (...) When it got here, neither the on-off switch nor the steaming switch worked. (...) Anyway, beware of this and all other cheap home espresso machines."
1,Avoid Brill equipment,"Although I've written repeatedly to Brill's U.S. representative for the past two years about serious out-of-the-box problems with a similar Brill espresso machine, they have never acknowledged a single letter.Others have had similar experiences. See letters of 4/8/03 and 4/17/03.If you bought a Brill and it works, may your luck stretch beyond the warranty. If you bought a Brill product and it doesn't work, trash it now and save yourself more grief.Else, avoid Brill products like the plague."
1,Pathetic,"Before buying, I read several reviews on the machine. All outstanding. I received my Multi-Pro and had to send the filter back as it was defective. I UPS my filter to them for $4.00 and they sent me another defective filter on a 50 cent envelope two weeks later. Meanwhile, my [jewel] was collecting dust...Look elsewhere for good java making."
1,Amazon has failed,"Unfortunately, Amazon has failed to fill my order in time for the holidays. My initial order was placed on December 12 with a pledge for shipping 7 to 10 days later. By dealing with Amazon, they have been unable to fulfill the order, stating that they have noticed the product is defective (when the product has been placed into shipping - 3 times now). As a result, I have concluded that either Amazon is either incapable of checking its product while it is still on its shelves OR Briel is not able to manufacture a trustworthy product. Upon receipt, I will be happy to update this review. But until then, read the aforementioned review and draw your own conclusions (based on the facts of my personal experience with Amazon - as of December 18, 2001 7:00 p.m.)"
5,coming from a product of Bible Man,"I am a 21 year old girl who grew up watching Bible Man. I think the show is fantastic. Watching the episodes now with the children I babysit I think they are a bit cheesey but having watched them as a child and seeing how much my kids love them that doesn't matter. It is a great and wholesome show that gives boys the action/""fighting"" craving taken care of and the girls good entertainment. I would recomend this show to anyone. The message of Christ is strong yet not over powering."
5,Forgive and Love - Testimony of a Woman raised by Lesbian Mom,"This is a book about a woman who was raised by a lesbian mother. The journey of the author from childhood through adulthood, from pain, anger, neglect, abuse, forgiveness and love is incredible. The honesty and openess of the author is refreshing and it gives the perspective of a child with a homosexual parent. The ramification of childhood has long lasting effects as evidenced throughout the book.The writing is simple and blunt and it transported me into the pages of Jakii's life-which could easily be mine. There were times when I threw the book across the room in anger, there were moments when I was hysterical with laughter and throughout the entire book, I was brought to tears. This book caused me to examine my own relationship with my parents (who are not gay). It caused me to examine my relationships with others and it stirred a desire in me to know more of this love that Jakii found much later in her life after becoming a christian."
2,2 stars,"Capitalizing on his popular Left Behind books, Mr. Lahaye and his associate give a concise summary of their view of the end times. Slight nods are given to the other two dominant viewpoints on eschology, but the only one truly covered is the premil view. Though highly biased, the final page, ironically, is rather helpful, giving sage advice and encouragement to all Christians.Amanda Killgore"
4,BOUGHT IT FOR $6.99!I HAVEN'T PLAYED BUT HEARD!,"SHE IS THE S***, AND I'LL SUPPORT HER!I LIKE HER MUSIC AND HER BEATS BANG"
1,Total garbage.,"All it took was one listen to realize what sheer waste this album is. Do yourselves a favor and hear how it's supposed to be done by checking out ""Arular"" by MIA, who this talentless tart is desperately trying to ape. Every song's vocals are digitally multi-tracked in order to disguise LS's lack of talent. The entire album is annoying. There's nothing good on it, in fact, I can hardly remember what the hell I just listened to - and that's a good thing. Thank god I didn't pay to listen to it, for if I had, the cd would now be laying in the trash compactor shattered into a thousand little, worthless pieces."
3,good start!,"This is a fun one - cool beats, funny/badass lyrics - her newer material gets even better, so don't stop here!"
2,Booyakasha,"All I have to say is that Lady Sovereign is the female version of Ali G except it's serious!!! (at least I think so). For that alone I'm afraid I cannot give it even one iota of respect, or rather RESPEKT. The only redeeming quality about this is that I think she's kind of cute, and the music is disgustingly catchy. The kitsch factor is off the charts...I don't know may be it has to grow on you."
4,Excellent renderings of human natures,"The Best of Jane Austen's works, this novel of 18th century England evokes a wide range of emotions. The heroine is anadmirable young gentlewoman not without flaws. Countering her flaws is a sheaf of rock solid virtues. Revolving around Miss Elizabeth Bennet is a varied cast of characters. Her interactions with them teach her much. The lessons she learns are timeless. I found the politeness and decorum displayed by even the meanest of the characters a welcome relief from the coarseness casually offered today. I expect to offer this book to my daughter when she's a little older."
3,"It's good for dusty, musty throats to let out dusty, lusty notes.","This album features songs written by Dr. Seuss and sung by a male/female chorus. The songs are short and feature minimal instrumental backing. They were originally published in a book also called The Cat in the Hat Songbook. The album was recorded circa 1967. This is a fun album that will appeal to kids, especially if they have the book so they can sing along."
5,Kicknosway's Best Collection Ever,"""Mixed Plate"" is Kicknosway at her best: the strongest of the old mixed with wonderful new poems and prose poems. I found this volume to be witty, entertaining, superbly crafted and jumping off the page with surprises. This is an eminently readable work. The pen-and-ink drawings (cover and interior), also by Kicknosway, are as uniquely imaginative as the words of the text. Hers is a truly original voice. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading and re-reading these poems."
1,Worst Collection Ever,"This was the absolute worst collection of poetry I've ever read. I've tried several times to read Kicknosway's work, but each time I have to stop and toss the book across the room. The constant elitist tone and the choppy and uneven flow makes this poetry a worse read than Paris Hilton's Myspace Blogs. Save your money and read the tv guide- its a much better read."
1,NOT DURRABLE,The frisbee edges were all chewed off within in hour by my 4 year old Golden Retriever. Not even close to durable or tough.
4,"Pretty good, but dog still found a way to tear it up","Lasted about 3-4 weeks before the dog found a way to tear it up. Still works fine, but is a little wobbly in the air. Would get this product again, because any other typical frisbee only lasts abot 1 session."
1,My dog chewed it,"Hi,I have a one year old border collie/ rat terrier mix and I have not been able to find any frisbee that he cannot destroy. I have tried the Kong, the Hyperflite Jawz, The Zogoflex Zisc and the Nylabone Flexible Frisbee Flying Disc and he has been able to chew all of them. I try to keep it away from him, but it only takes a short time and he has them chewed. The zogoflex zisc did last the longest. He had chewed the edge of the Hyperflite Jawz within the first 3 times that he played with it."
1,Hyperflite Jawz Dog Frisbee,"I bought this for my 14 pound Labradoodle, Dee Dee, who loves to catch frisbees. She's chewed up everything I've ever bought her before so I thought this would be great. However, the disc is really hard and after only playing with her for about 10 minutes, her mouth was bleeding. I would not buy this again."
3,great frisbee but a bit hard,It is hard to find a good frisbee that is tough enough for my frisbee obsessed blue heeler but won't make her bleed. I own 2 of these frisbees. The dog prefers these to the foam ones that are destroyed in a matter of hours. They fly well and a really durable.unfortunatly she bites her tounge every time. Let me just say that bloody frisbees take the fun out of plat time for me. I am now on the search for the perfect marriage of durability and flexibility. But honestly I will always have one of these frisbees around. They are great.
1,Different than first one,Purchased one of these 18 months ago. It has been used daily by a border collie and lab/pit mix and is still in great shape. I re-ordered two more. Within 2 hours of opening the new order the discs were ripped. I wrote the company thinking it could just be a bad batch. No response. To me this means they must have taken some cost cutting measures that now produce an inferior product
4,Good,"While it's not as sturdy/thick as a disc-golf disc, it fly's straight and the dog hasn't chewed through it yet. Would be nice if it glowed for a little longer...but overall not bad."
5,My dog and I LOVE these!,"These frisbees are the best! They don't get all chewed up even after months of playing! Don't throw them in a lake though, they sink immediately! Haha"
5,"This is the ""Forever"" frisbee!","We were skeptical, to say the least, when we bought this disc, but after going through multiple Kongs and other semi-pricey ones, we thought we'd take a leap of faith, believe the positive reviews and get one. So glad we did! We've had this thing for a year now, and it gets daily use and ""lives"" out in the yard. It has been run over by a tractor (more than once), survived numerous tugs-of-war between the two dogs, been in extreme heat and cold, been played with/chomped/stomped by our donkey, and other than being dirty, it is in great shape. It flies well (my husband can really make the thing sail), and our dog just loves it. Now, he isn't one to sit there and chew on a frisbee, but just through normal ""intended"" use, he would wear other ones out. Not this one. I expect to have it for years to come! Don't know how these people make money, being that you only need to buy the one, but thanks guys!"
3,Virtually indestructible and a great throw...not quite....,I have been purchasing those $1 discs for my dogs at a chain pet store. Surprisingly they were decent throws and sailing that my goldens would get some impressive catches. That is until they chewed them up (which was quickly). This is why I purchased this product. I was so excited when it arrived and could not wait to try it out. My husband and I consider ourselves average (him above average) throwers. Neither of us can get any height or smooth sailing from this disc. None of my dogs have yet to catch a single toss with this disc because it seems to just fall to the ground. They are spending more time chewing on it (and yes it has no chew marks on it) than catching it. Disappointed.
4,Jawz Disc,My dog like the Disc.it looks durableI didn't give five stars because i believe the price for dog disc is expensive.
5,JAWS DISC 8.75 CHERRY RED,"My German Shephered likes this Disc very much, she is a rough playing dog and likes to chew on plastic. But this disc flies very very well, and her teeth does not hurt this disc at all. I am glad that finually, someone made a disc, that big DOGS CAN'T CHEW. I highly recommend this Disc. Jim in Ohio"
5,Best frisbee ever!,"This frisbee won't quit! Our dogs love it and it has lasted for 6 + months. We don't let them use it as a chew toy, strictly for throwing, which it is perfect for!"
3,Just Okay,I have a Dog that loves to play Frisbee and I was going through a lot of them I thought this one might be a little better and last longer as he is pretty rough on them so I bought it. I was disapointed when i got it because for what I paid it was really not any better than the ones I was using that cost half as much . Of course my dog likes it because he just likes to play . I would probably not order it again
4,Better in only one way,"My Frisbee addicted Whippet has destroyed about 15 ""Aerobie Superdisc's"" . I ordered the ""Hyperflite K-10 Jawz Dog Disc"" This disc has held up very well. Everything else is better about the Aerobie, softer on the dogs mouth, nicer hand grip, better flight until destroyed, floats in my pond. I just can't continue to buy a new Aerobie every week. My whippet puts small nicks in the Hyperflite plastic; these nicks cut your fingers like glass. I now use gloves when tossing the Hyperflite. If I cannot figure out how to retrieve the Hyperflite from the bottom of my pond I guess I will order another."
2,Good but not great,"The author makes some good points, however, there are inaccurate facts and out of context quotes. Overall, it is an interesting read but not one I would recommend. Aviation security is an ongoing challenge. We can always do better. The book points this out, but provides limited suggestions on what should be done."
1,Poor condition,"The CD was advertised as being in very good condition, like new. However, it is in poor condition, with many scratches that result in numerous skips and static. These problems could not be remedied by a proper cleaning of the CD. I also played the CD on different CD players to make sure that there wasn't an issue with the player, but this proved that the problems stem from the CD itself."
3,Would be better if it were complete!,"This compilation is missing two songs from the original albums: ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" and ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"" ~ these original recordings by Perry Como are over 50 years old and still stand the test of time. BMG could do better with their Como releases."
3,"Fascinated,bothered, bewildered, so far...","About a third of the way into the book which I began reading during an IVP test for distraction purposes. I am feeling more confused as I go but largely because my historical and geographic knowledge of the region is very limited. I think this is good for me to know(in a hair shirt sort of way). I've read novels set (approximately)in the region and have begun to feel as though I have strayed back into one of them but behind the scenes, drifting through the background unconnected to the story of the novel. However I will continue reading. I am in its thrall, though mystified and chastened by my ignorance."
3,One Last Score,"If you are a cynic, you will like this movie. It should also make you think about the connection between Americans and Mexicans. I hearby, declare this to be a cult movie. My main criticism is they could have put Bruce Dern and David Keith to better use. Not a great movie, but some of it told the truth."
1,"Save your money - buy ""Battleship"" instead","Potboiler history of the loss of Repulse and Prince of Wales off Malaya on 10 December 1941.If you know nothing about this, you might find it worth a look, but compared to Middlebrook and Mahoney's excellent ""Battleship"", the whole thing has a stale, second hand feel to it, with little evidence of much if any original research.Apart from various typos and a couple factual errors I came across in the edition that I picked up in a second hand shop, you could also criticise the author for dealing with the actual events of 10 December far too briefly.Recent editions of this 1960s book are sadly yet more evidence that some books simply aren't worthy of a reprint."
5,Bleh. Need I say more?,Pinter's writing style is as fluffy and self-aggrandizing as in FoxTalk.I also found the information contained to be less than useful beyond a cursory level.
3,A pleasant tale of 19th Century British society,"This early H.G. Wells' tale is about a 20-something year old man who has a job as a draper's assistant, a job which he is probably too old for. Loaded with poor self esteem and a second class status, poor Mr. Hoopdriver takes a ten day holiday. On this holiday he falls for a young socialite named Jessie who is rebelling against her stepmother and society. The tale has many interesting insights into the ""proper"" behavior of a British socialite. For example, late in the story one of Wells' characters says you must live fearlessly and honestly, but only as long as you do what everyone else expects of you and avoid doing extravagent things. The tale is also funny at times as it describes early bike riders trying to ride poorly designed bicycles. Though generally easy enough to read and follow, there are times when some words will baffel the reader."
1,They do not fit ANY wine bottles!,These Hoffritz Wine Savers just do not tightly fit the neck of any wine bottle I have tried them on. They barely reach the sides and so do not form a proper seal. Look elsewhere.
3,OK for the money,"You could spend more, but it does the job. I gave it a 3 because I thought it would have less plastic construction."
1,Hoffritz Wine Saver usability,"I'm delighted with the functionality of this product. While doing an excellent job in bottles with openings that correspond to the stopper's measurements it is, however, too narrow for bottles with larger openings. A major shortcoming I found is that the black plastic material on the top of the stopper tends to break when closing the lock. Without the top material, the expansion effect of the stopper is decreased and becomes unsusable. Of the four stoppers I purchased, only one is still unbroken."
1,TERRIBLE!,"These items worked for about 4 times each. The plastic insert on the top that the metal lever rocks on to seal or unseal the stopper broke on both stoppers. The metal on the lever actually cuts into the plactic insert when you push it down to seal the bottle - cutting the plastic insert in half. When the plactic insert breaks, you can not seal the bottle. Don't waste you money. This product needs to be re-engineered."
1,Not a good product,This is not a good product. I bought a set and one stopped working with in the first hour. The working Bud produced loud whistling noise. These are made to use out side. The noise is even worse if worn out side in the wind. Save your money.
5,Hearing amplifiers,"My wife has a hearing deficit brought about by incessant chatter. I bought her these little fellahs and she can hear herself blather once again and if she too tires of listening to herself, she can just pop the little fellahs out and she is once again not stuck in the hell I find myself in."
3,SSI 2 Buds,"These work good for hearing enhancement. However, if you plan to go shooting with these, they do not work for that purpose at all.The over all build quality is okay."
2,Ear Buds use them or not,"These ear Buds are not the most comfortable items to wear nor do they stay in the ears. I nearly have to jammed them in my ears for them to stay for just a couple of minutes, plus the sound that they allow you to hear sounds like the person is under water or has a mask on. I guess these are good for something, but I am not sure what."
2,SSI 2 Bud Hearing Enhancemtn with Tone Control,not comfortable in the ear it whistles and it states it have different level of volume but it only have off and high.
2,paint ball pack,"the airtank, hose, and belt are good but they dont include the 4 loaders they show. just a heads up"
5,"A Must buy, this is an awesome book! :)","I am having an irish wedding and needed some help with ideas. This book did it all from the planning to the reception (it even gave me some great ideas for my vows!) I had done months and months of searching for information and always came up with the same old stuff. When I got this in the mail, it changed my wedding planning from nightmarish to easy and a lot of fun. Besides all of the great ideas and recipes (yum :) it has many sayings, superstitions, blessings, and fun facts that add some charm to the whole aspect of holding an Irish wedding. My fiance even got hyped about helping with the coordination of the event, inspired by the ideas this book had offered. A MUST buy."
2,Cashing in on the ignorance of Irish-Americans,"If you are not Irish you might enjoy this book, but for anyone who is actually from Ireland or in touch with Irish culture this book reads like a bit of a sham. My wife is Irish born and so were my parents, and we picked this book up for our wedding. I wish we had read through it a bit more before we got it. It was of no use to us as we knew that most of the customs in it either weren't for real or would be laughed at by our Irish relations attending the wedding. Yes there are some old time customs listed in it...are they practical or ""Irish""? We did not find them so. If you are a New Ager or have a fantasy view of Irish culture this book might work for you, but otherwise, save your money for the wedding."
3,Helpful and fun,this book is a good guide for an irish wedding. it does not provide many resources but it has a lot of information on traditions. it is interesting and basically helpful
3,I liked it but...,"Needing a good deal of information about my familiy's heritage to incorporate into my recent marriage, I bought a couple of the books about Irish Weddings that are currently on the market. Although Ms. Haggerty's book was informative and helpful (I especially liked the info on Papal Blessings), I thought ""Irish Wedding Traditions"" had more updated information and more ideas for the ceremony."
1,If your not catholic don't buy this book,"Before I got married I really excited to incorporate Irish customs and traditions. I was so happy when I received this book, until I started reading it. Don't get me wrong it is a very interesting book. But although my husband and I are of Irish decent, being what would be concidered protestant christians I was unable to incorporate any of the blessings or ideas for readings, since they were all meant for a Catholic wedding. If you want history buy the book. If you're Catholic buy the book. For the rest of us. . .save your money for your honeymoon."
2,"Nice book, but ordering a used one means that someone has written in it!","It was only on the inside, but it made me uncomfortable. It just hadn't occurred to me that it might be inscribed. Perhaps this is standard, but it seemed odd to me. The book is short and sweet."
5,Gerber safety features lured me to the product!,"The video was good and clear on product features. I especially liked the safety features of the Gerber. Once I showed my husband, he thought this was great. He is on a Safety Committee at work and was anxious to share the product with the team."
2,Form Over Fuction,"I think that Gerber just wanted to get as many tools as possible into one Multi-plier. I bought mine to replace an older model Multi-plier that I dropped in the river. I was disappointed. There is too much stuff. The can opener is not functional and the Phillips head screwdriver has been cut in half in order to add more stuff.If you just want to play ""mine is bigger than yours"", than this is the one for you. If you plan on using it for something other than display, you should consider an older model."
5,ANOTHER BESTSELLER,"I have read all of Beverly Jenkins novels, and I am glad to say that Through the Storm is another great book! I do not read romance novels regularly, but I will read those written by Ms. Jenkins. She is truly a talented author and I can't wait for the next book. Keep on keeping on Ms. Jenkins!"
3,Something is missing,"I have read all of Ms Jenkins's books and love her writing style. However I was a little disappointed with this book. In her perevious book where she first introduced Ramond he was a very dasing man that we could not wait to hear his story. well that long awaited story was very disappointing. Ramond was not as dashing and he seemed to lose his charm in this book. In all of her other books the male chacthers seem to be larger then life and Mrs. Jenkins made you not only want to meet this man but you WANTED those men. Some where something was lost in the writing of this book. I still believe Mrs. Jenkins to be a wounderful writer but that she did not do the Ramond that was in ""Indigo"" justice."
4,Lovely Romance,"This love story is extremely historical, with pounds and pounds of information on Black and White America. BJ is so clever with her writing skills she makes you want to twist Raimond's neck but love him at the same time. This is a realistic love story that many will love."
4,A story of passion,"This is one of my favorite Beverly Jenkins historical novels. I was introduced to one of the main characters, Raimond, in another romance of hers called ""Indigo."" I was hoping to hear more of his story and fell in love with the very intricate details only Ms. B can deliver. Sable and Raimond fall in love, then are separated due to desparate circumstances, then are reunited by fate. There are misconceptions, misunderstandings and a lot of hurt involved before they both realize that they love one another. This book is a keeper and the reader will not be disappointed. There is enough passion and just enough history to keep the reader riveted!"
5,For the Love of Raimond,"Ms. Beverly has done it once again! There is no love greater than that you find being ushered by the LeVeq men! This is a greater than awesome book, and I highly recommend that if you like Historical Romance or even just Romance, you should purchase and read this book. You will not be disappointed!"
5,Great Book,I am a new Beverly Jenkin's fan. I loved this book. Great plot and character development.
4,great historical romance.........,"As usual, Ms. Jenkins has done her homework and presented an exciting historical romance with ""positive"" and uplifting images of African Americans. I always feel more amourous after reading her books. The men portrayed in her books allow you to fantasize to the utmost... Keep up the good work............Do you have an e-mail address so I can write to you........"
5,Excellent & Exciting - Found Time Somehow to Read This Book!,I recently discovered Beverly Jenkins. I never actively read 'romance' books and now I wonder if I've been missing out. Her development of characters and their relationship with Sable is wonderful. Sable's mother-in-law was a pearl and her brother-in-laws were humorous and brotherly. It was great to show Raimond's attachment and involvement with the adopted children. I love how the men in these books are larger than life and how they are attracted to strong-minded women. Ms. Jenkins is an excellent writer and I can't wait for her new book (I also am searching for copies of her out of print books - Indigo and Vivid.
3,General/Practical,"A good book to pick up if you are new to the area, but there are some trails in the area that are not mentioned in the book?It is small enough to stuff in the back of your jersey pocket, or hydration pack."
4,Good overview of area trail networks,This book provides a good listing of trails in the Denver/Boulder area. There are maps for each trail and altitude charts to show the elevation gain. The directions to the trail heads are accurate.The one thing I don't like is that it only gives information about one trail for each system.
2,Very useful,"The author doesn't mind throwing little jabs at men, portraying them as bumbling ego-driven bosses to manipulate, and women as the people men should strive to understand (it doesn't occur to the author that women might strive to bridge the communication gap by learning to speak to men in the way men use language--directly and verbally, without relying on hints, winks, and ""read-my-mind-if-you-love-me"" shrugs).In spite of that, at least she recognizes correctly that there are differences between the sexes. But the main point of the book is achieved."
5,A gem of a book for out-front ideas on addictions,"The book is very readable for the non-medical community. It gets right to the point of the author's 'biobalance' theory. References to research are detailed. Author frames his explanation of theory to be comprehensive, but readily understandable. Seems to build a plateau from which further research would and should continue. My only reservations: seems to be a lack of research on the 'smoking gun' portions of theory (especially, not enough detail on the phen-fen studies to evaluate their true importance). I give this 5 stars because an audience that would be even mildly interested in this subject can take alot away from this book. It is a fast read, but will make your mind think about your brain (or others' brains) many times after you put this book down."
4,Good book. A good reference to brain chemisty.,This book is good in that it kinda skips past the self-help oppinionated stuff and helps the reader understand the chemistry of addition. The book makes alot of sense and gives good insight. I reccomend it.
3,Good stuff!... but there is more to choose from...,"Overall its an enjoyable Cd with lots of danceable rhythms but I don't know if Cache is the best Canadian representation of salsa. In the city of Toronto there are other artists who I feel do a better job, most noticeably Alberto Alberto and his orchetra. But Cache is still a fierce band with lots of positive energy and this Cd shows it. Good job guys!"
3,lack of black,this tv is good although it does not produce black color very well and if i'm going to watch tv i want total best quality but it is worth the wait for a better projection tv...

5,A must read in the MRCS (AED) exam,"It is a book written by the emergency department of the NUS. It lists out the most important facts clearly. It is an essential reading for all us working in the ED, and also those preparing for the examination!!"
5,BEST A&E GUIDE,"Concise, easy to read and understand, A&E pearls well emphasized. Includes tips for GPs like me. Practical procedures and essential ortho tests explained, not too lengthy but just the important facts. I've learned a great deal of important points to look at on a radiographic films from this book. This black book is a 'must buy' for every emergency physician but GPs would benefit a lot from this book too! I still use this as my guide from time to time...'can't afford to miss an emergency case in my hand."
3,An Adequate Read,"Thomas' writings on cats big or small is a worthwhile read for those who are cat owners or are interested in the furry beasties. She adeptly draws parallels to those you find in the African savannahs with those who laze the day away in the shady spot in your garden.Her anecdotes are often amusing, and her writing conjures vivid images in the mind's eye.The only criticism I have regarding this work is that I was hoping for something a little more objective as many passages seemed to be a little too ""preachy"" to me.It is worth the read."
5,Simply excellent!,Beyond the purr. This delightful little book explains why your cat is a kitten indoors and a lion in the garden.
2,not a compelling read,"given the title, i expected the book to contain ancedotes, stories and personal observations. This book does contain all of the above, but they were not as numerous, as informative, nor as insightful as i had hoped. Possibly having lived with cats all my life, and having seen a few nature shows on big cats, made this book kind of uninformative for me."
1,HOFFRITZ DOES NOT STAND BEHIND ITS PRODUCTS,"This Fondou Set looks and sounds great, just like the motorized toaster I recently bought from them, but when it stopped working, they failed to back it up with service. In fact, they told me there was nothing they could do, even if I paid for service. I guess they are another large corporation (Salton/Hoffritz also make the George Forman line) that is getting cheap goods from overseas and charging high prices for them. Too bad. They were great once. Caveat emptor."
3,Jury still out...,"We have attempted both chocolate and cheese fondue in this pot and both have burned. The last time we were especially careful to constantly check the cheese and adjust the flame, but it burned anyway. The thin stainless steel pan has no pad on the bottom, and the large fuel container allows for a lot of heat. We are going to make one last attempt with this pot in hopes that it will make good broth and/or oil fondue for meat."
2,My family & I really enjoy fonduing especially my 10 yr old,"I had purchased the same exact Hoffritz fondue pot as pictured but while heating olive oil for fonduing steak the handle of the pot melted off the very first time I used it. It makes tranferring the pot from stove to table very difficult- not to mention dangerous!Also, the oil goes from extremely hot-splattering hot oil all over and burning the outside of everything to taking forever to cook 15 minutes later even though the burner below is on.In my opinion an electric burner might be easier to control temperature and keep temp more even."
2,got burned...,"This fondue pot burns chocolate and cheese,badly. not a very honest description given."
1,It burns anything I cook,Whenever I use the fondue set it burns too hot and anything I am cooking ends up with a burnt taste. I close the lid to the heater element and it still burns too hot. I dont' know what to do to prevent this from happening.
2,BURNT FONDUE,We have had no luck heating the fondue in this fondue pot. It burns even when you turn the heat way down. We had to keep lighting the sterno and then putting it out again in order to keep the cheese from returning to its solid form. I'm not impressed.
5,"I disagree with Amber Pippin from Aurora, CO","While RFK may not be prominent in our history books, I can assure you that more RFK books sell than JFK or Jacqueline..... can't believe it? Take a look at my Auction Page on Amazon (Seller name Gisbow). One quick review of my Sold Auctions will show that Robert is still, as difficult as it may be to imagine, much much more popular than brother John.I have been selling out-of-print Robert Francis Kennedy books to customers all over the world, Japan, Sweden, England, etc., all of my customers express the same sentiment.... I expect this book to be a hit... a big hit; consistent with all books written about Bobby Kennedy."
1,Lacks objectivity,"No person is without fault and Robert Kennedy was no exception. But, Steel's analysis takes this fact too far, nearly villifying Kennedy while arguing that Bobby, the great man and idealist, was only a myth. He portrays a weak man obsessed with winning power and protecting the family name. His Bobby is a political animal. His actions are portrayed as anything but genuine and used only to obtain his goals. We have idealized Bobby Kennedy, but Steel's conviction that all we admire in him is merely myth lacks thoughtfulness. The only purpose I see in the book is an attempt to diminish the reader's admiration of Kennedy, or to increase his disdain. The author uses facts and quotes to his own purpose, not always putting them in proper context. This forces the reader to question much of what is written in the book."

5,Wild Neighbors: The Humane Approach to Living with Wildlife (2nd ed.),This book is great for wildlife rehabilitators' use in helping homeowners to solve wildlife conflicts. It is also an excellent tool to help homeowners to understand and live in harmony with the wild animals that are forced to move into their neighborhoods as more of their natural habitat disappears.
4,Still Goin' Freebirds,"I saw them on there comeback tour and wept.( So good) They have kept going and frankly got better. With Ricky, especially, skynyrd are are very tight band. Listen and enjoy!"
3,Old one but good one,"This book has to be taken little bit with relation to the time of publishing. First of all, the physics and theories change every year. Aprove/disaprove of them is on Yearly basis. So the Bryan put all actual information and founding and some future prediction into this book.For me it was clear and acceptable way how the author introduce himself, introduce some basic facts, some basic and advanced physics.After this he kick you to the sea of the new stuff.This part is prety exiting. All those, who read the S.Hawkings books it will be just repeating of it, but different way, so it is up to reader if he like Hawking's or Greene's style.Some chapters or parts of the chapters are dificult to be clear after several re-reads. I spent day or two only to get some overview what he si writting about. But finally my brain survive it.So yours can survive it too."
4,A Great Book.,"This is a very interesting book. Although I do not agree with everything he says, it is still a good read and I recommend it. The only problem I had with it, is that he tries too hard to explain stuff. He will explain the same thing over and over using different examples, one example is enough for me. Other than that it is a great book."
5,Is Science As Significant As Plumbing?,"What are the great discoveries? What improves our lives? Can we go to a parallel galaxy 44M lightyears away? If we can, should we install a moral government there...with force if necessary. Maybe we could start all of our TV shows at 5 minutes after their's start so that after they see that everything else they've seen is boring at least they can watch something new that might not be boring, from the begining."
5,Perfect.,This is just the book I was looking for. I read half a sentence and I am in deep sleep. If you have a problem with sleeping this is your remedy. Cheers.
5,super!,Excellent Book for the casual or just sorta interested in physics type of person. was very easy to read and explained the ideas very well!
5,I devoured this book!,"Even if you're not a physicist or mathematician, you can understand this book. Dr. Greene clearly and carefully makes his case for superstring theory potentially being the ultimate, unifying theory describing everything-- from quantum to cosmological phenomena. His love for physics shines throughout this book, and I found it irresistible. It was exciting to read."
5,understanding of the unknown.,"for one who is not tuned into understanding math, other than adding and subtraction of number, mr greene has opened my eyes to another world yet to be understood,not only by me but to many of his peer group.i believe we have a mr. enistein II on our hands."
3,A Good Introduction to M-Theory,"I recommend this book only as latest update. For style and philosophical background, I recommend Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time""; for historical and physical background, I recommend ""Superstrings: A Theory of Everything?"" eds. by P.C.W.Davies and J.Brown; for basic concret content, I recommend ""Superstrings and the Search for The Thory of Everything"" by E.David Peat, which also includes Roger Penrose's Twistor Theory. As latest update, Web surfing maybe will be more fun for some of us :-)."
5,A Feast of a Book!,"This book is a sheer delight to read! Brian Greene's clarity of thinking and joy of exploring the quest for the ultimate physics theory come clearly through as he describes how superstrings just might be the ""common thread"" that runs through this universe from the tiniest quantum bits to the largest relativistic bodies. Are you curious to know how all these dimensions can exist in our universe unseen? Greene brilliantly describes memorable analogies (such as an ant seen from a distance to be walking along on a garden hose) that give readers a clear sense of what hidden curled dimensions might feel like... and he writes about physics with such grace and style! If you've hungered to know how to better understand hidden dimensions and superstrings, this book is guaranteed to first pique and then satisfy your appetite."
5,One of the best,"'The Elegant Universe' is, I'd have to say, the best book I've seen on the subject of the theory of everything. I'm 17 yrs old and plan on majoring in astrophysics in college. This book gives a fanastic overview of the two fundamental theories in physics: the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Even though I had a pretty good background in those theories, reading the book provided even more understanding on them. The book discusses the Superstring theory as a possible unifying theory. You don't have to be a genius to understand it. The book makes it easy to get a basic understanding of the concepts. Probably the best thing about this book is that it describes everything in english without complicated formulas. I would recommend this book to anyone who has even the smallest interest in the topic. It's definitely worth the read. It's one of my favorite books."
5,The best book on Quantum Physics that I have ever read!,"Not since I have read ""Permaculture a Designers manual"" chapters on ""concepts and themes in design"", ""methods of design"" and ""pattern understanding"" have I found a book that ties together different laws of physics so well. The author ties together the different laws of physics in a way that anyone could understand. The only criticism I could make of this book, and it is a very minor one at that, is that it does not show how the patterns behind these theories can be applied to everyday life, ""Permaculture, a designers manual"" is better for this since the theories behind living systems are easier to apply to the real world than the theories behind inanimate, material, systems."
2,Over My Head,"Reading some of the other reviews I got the impression that this book was made for the average man - that would be me. I enjoyed the first few chapters but as the book went on it was pretty easy to see that it was far beyond my realm of knowledge.Don't get me wrong, the book had its moments but for me it was a tough read. The discussions about Calabi-Yau manifolds, two dimensional worlds etc. lost me completely.Bottom line, unless you know this stuff you should probably take a pass."
4,Any woman is more elegant than UNIVERSE,"For past 300- 400 years, that is, since times, Galilei and Kepler development of a science have resulted in scale changes. Despite of it we, perhaps, lag behind for 100 years because, that could know now.The fathers of physics Aristotle and Archimedes have put the bases of this science and are from us on two millenniums.We can admit, that the God has decided to talk with certain physicist. And the physicist naturally would ask God about reliability of our knowledge of life. The answer, perhaps, would be unequivocal at you is Evangeline and some physical theories. Their conformity to a nature is adequate! See: thevortextheory.com.The author did not try to show the scientists his competence; he simply has written a good statement of modern problems of physics for a wide range of the readers.If you are interested in physics in 15, 20, 40 and 70 years - read!And you will find a lot of interesting and instructive.vavivlad-rvc@mtu-net.ru"
3,Who is this guy?,"Greene makes some good points the main one being that strings are interesting(the best example being the calculation of black hole entropy) despite the lack of experimental evidence.For a layman such as myself, it was quite accessible.My only complaint is that the book seems a little biased towards the work of Greene himself. I have no reliable method of estimating his contribution but, judging from the book, it was him, Witten and a few others who made the field. Witten I believe."
1,absolutely lost me,This is a book that Simon Singh should have written.The author claims String Theory has all the answers to everything but that hardly anyone knows anything certain about it. While he's an excellent writer I just could not understand all the explanations of 11 dimensions and pretty much everything else that had to do with string theory. After reading all the other 1-star reviews I'm glad I'm not alone.Sounds like String Theory should be called BS Theory.
3,"GOOD BOOK, BUT TOO MUCH FLUFF","I would love to rate this book higher than 3 stars, because I learned a lot from it, and the author obviously cares about both his material and his audience, but there was just too much fluff.The author talks way too much about how exciting it was, sharing emails and meeting with his friends, as he was working out new ideas about string theory. He should have put more time into stating clearly what the essential elements of string theory are, now that he understands them, and less time sharing with us about how much fun he had figuring it all out. You will get something out of this book if you take time to read it, but you have to wade through way too much ""dark matter"" before you get to experience the photons.The editors who helped prepare this book for publication need to learn about being ""knife minded,"" and helping authors to ""omit needless words."""
2,Superficial Documentary,"I bought this DVD set to broaden my knowledge on theoretical physics. However, from the instant I placed the DVD in my player to the last minute of the documentary it was a complete disappointment. Information is very superficial; no deep understanding of Universe is conveyed, full of no-sense animations, colors flying from there to there, a documentary that anyone would expect on Discovery Channel, full of metaphors that make no sense at all. If you posses some degree of physics do not spend your money on this. If it will be your first time to theoretical physics it's ok, though! Positive comments of others were very misleading this time..."
3,Tough to Get Through,"Perhaps this was the wrong book for me to get the basics on String Theory. I'm not a scientist and the reason for picking up the book was to get an appreciation for what strings are about. The book rambled on a bit and was overly detailed in many parts. I had trouble reading some parts and ended up skimming through several chapters.Unlike some other reviewers, I actually looked forward to the analogies made. It helped me understand the points he was making. The garden hose analogy of how we may be unable to perceive other dimensions was interesting in the same way the book ""Flatlanders"" made its case for 3 dimensions from the perspective of someone living in two dimensional space. I also enjoyed reading Greene's descriptions of Einstein's contributions to General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics."
3,Good description of a bad theory,"A great and well written book. Its only flaw is that the reader may come away with the impression that string theory is somehow accepted as valid. It isnt. String theory is unproven and most likely wrong.This is a historic book, in the future somebody is going to read this either with an amused chuckle or awe at its precience. My money is on the chuckle."
5,For fans of the theoretical,This book is a wonderful read! Greene makes no assumptions about what you know; carefully explaining everything you'll need to understand the basic theory of strings. He explains difficult concept with colorful analogies. Who would have thought learning quantum mechanics or relativity would be this easy? I recommend this book for anyone who likes theoretical science or high school students going into college for physics.
3,uneven,"The book's audience is unclear. The elementary parts are too elementary, and the more recent material is just barely comprehensible, even to someone with a master's in nuclear engineering. Some nice examples, but nothing so original."
5,An elegant book,"Brian Greene has a gift for simplifying complex physical theories and transferring his enthusiasm for the workings of the universe to those of us who are on the outside of the latest discoveries. Clear, concise and replete with down-to-earth metaphors and analogies the book is a joy to read. The author's humble approach to some of the most current, mystifying theories of the physical world leaves the reader stunned and informed about the work being done to discover the secrets of the multiverse. He makes clear that altho he's writing about the ""final theory"" it is definitely only another stepping stone to understanding where it/we all came from. An excellent read!"
5,"Elegant universe, elegant book","I'll be using it in my ""Physics for Poets"" courses. This is an important book for getting to the advanced topics. Students need to have fresh and modern topics for consideration of this subject of physics, ones that get beyond ""heat, light and sound."" This is an excellent book."
1,The Kindle edition lacks the drawings,Be warned: the Kindle edition of this book is totally lacking any of the figures referred to throughout the entire book. This is a huge and unnecessary omission. The Kindle can handle the graphics so this oversight is unexplainable.
4,Readable Science for the Layman,"I've a strong interest in current science, however, not being a mathematician or scientist I often find books, of this type, difficult to read and even harder to understand. Not so with ""The Elegant Universe"". String theory is a subject that doesn't lend itself to being easily understood but Brian Greene does an exemplary job of explaining most of it in understandable prose with a little humor added too. Includes information on relativity, the weak and strong forces and quantum mechanics."
3,Not an easy read,"I understand that this is a hard and involved subject. There are many building blocks to understand before one can get to string theory. I found myself getting sidetracked rather often, looking up addtional information on the topics. I think he did a decent job laying out the information, but I would have liked a little more detail. I find the theory interesting, but I could not get through the book. I got frustrated with the techinical parts. If you are going to read this, make sure you have a basic understanding of physics before you do."
3,Less than elegant,"Brian Greene has a penchant for hyperbole. He also has a maddening habit of oversimplifying some things and overcomplicating others. The best part of the book is on superstring theory, but much of the ""history"" that precedes it is poorly presented. One gets the feeling that his editors were too intimidated by his enthusiasm to reign him in.The Nobel Prize winner Robert Laughlin has written a better book, in my view, which covers much of the same ground. ""A Different Universe: Reinventing Physics from the Bottom Down,"" is much more accessible and at the same time more thoughtful.It is interesting to read the two books side by side. I believe most readers will find Laughlin's book superior."
5,Universal Truth For Dummies,"For 10 years I tried to understand Einstien's Relativity without success. In less than 100 pages (the first ""section"" of this wonderful book), Greene took care of that! The most compelling thing I found about this though, was that it seems, the deeper we get into science, the closer we come to proving that there is a universal consciousness."
4,Elegantly written,"A great book about physics in general. Brian Greene's writing is engaging and the diagrams explain concepts well. Read ""Elegant Universe,"" in 2003 and recently finished: ""The Shape of Inner Space: String Theory and the Geometry of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions,"" which explains, in depth, the mathematics behind String theory. It is a good experience to read Elegant Universe first and then the Shape of Inner Space right after."
5,WOW!,"I took two years of physics in college, I THOUGHT I understood General Relativity and Quantium Mechanics. But this book explained them much more throughly than I ever understood them before. Then went on to String Theory, and Super String Theory, and why SST is thought to be correct even though it is still untested.This has got to be the Ultimate ""the way things work"" book. Strongly recomended for anyone with an interest in ANY science."
5,So Elegent!,"when i read this book i was in 8th grade at age 14. my uncle whos like a nuclear problem solver suggested it to me. at first i thought it might be beyond my skill level, but once i started reading it, it was fantastic. im not a genius or anything of the sort but mr. greene did such a great job, i was amazed. previously my fav. author for science was carl sagan and his book cosmos. but greene may have him edged now. although i had gone through no physical science classes or anything of the sort, it made sense due to all of the analagies mr. greene used. this is the perfect book for anyone(anyone!) whos even mildly interested in space or science. id never even heard of string theory but now im a believer. so good. so easy. so elegent."
5,Great Book!,"This is a wonderful book. It is true you don't need to know a big deal of physics or math to understand the fundamental concepts of relativity and superstring theory. But beware, you DO need to know how to read!! Duh!? Leon C. LaBrecque are you READING this? Anyway, a must read for everyone interested in science. Highly recomended, you can't be dissapointed."
5,A true challenge,"I love this book! The first part about relativity is very readable and stimulates the brain. The second part about quantum mechanics and stringtheory is challenging, but it gives satisfaction when you get a glimpse what stringtheory is really about. This book really goes in-depth, be sure that you know what you're starting when you pick up the book."
4,The Elegant Univers,"No problems with the product, but it took a while for the book to get here. But I don't know if that's because of my building or the sender."
4,The Universe is even more elegant,"I've got the spanish edition, which is my mother tongue.Even when it doesn't show the actual elegance of the Universe, it's a very interesting book. I enjoy it. But, I think it's quite heavy for the non physicist reader, which is not my case, by the way. A friend of mine, an engineer interested in science, found it difficult to understand without just 'assuming' some concepts to be true. Nevertheless, I recommend it for any one who wants to get an idea of how the little world works."
4,Looking over Einstein's sholder,"Have you ever wished to watch as Albert Einstein developed the premises that lead to Relativity? Well this book is a introductory presentation of how we are almost there to a conclusive ""Theory of Everything"". It samples the personalities as well as the basic theorums that form super-string theory. It lacks the mathmatical proofs but that is a good thing for this type of presentation."
5,Great Overview of the State-of-the-Art in Physics,"Excellent book on the latest technological breakthoughs in string theory and M-theory. Written in challenging language, but understandable. Highly Recommended."
4,The Speed of Light,"This is a very well written book and it brings modern physics almost to the point of understandability for the average reader. However, on page 51 it states not once, but twice, that C squared is "" twice the speed of light "" which is not what they taught when I was in school. I'm sure it's only an error, but it's awfully embarassing to see it get past the author, the editors and the proofreaders."
1,Led astray,"Like the other reviews I have seen here, I can not recommend this book. I found Brian's explanation of the Heisenberg principle misleading and just plain wrong. I found a much better explanation in other books such as The Quantum Quark by Andrew Watson. So I stopped reading Brian's book altogether for fear that I would ingest more bad information; it is big on hype, low on facts."
1,E=Mc2 does not mean E=m2c,"I find it very difficult to enjoy a book who's description of Einstein's famous formula states that ""Energy equals mass times twice the speed of light"" If Greene cannot discern the difference between the square of something and 'twice' something, then all other statements made by him are suspect. I threw the book away, lest it contaminate someone else (besides Greene) that didn't know the difference between c2 and 2c."
2,Many holes and contradictions.,This book is a poor portrayal of the current views on science and applications in life. I found M. R. Franks' book entitled The Universe and Multiple Reality to be much more understandable and elegant.
3,Avant garde physics,"A nice book to read, but completely wrong. Reading it felt a bit like reading Aristotle's Physics - great insights but a little crazy (anachronistically). I think the legacy of this book, the most popular of the ""quantum / string theory for everyone"" genre, will be as a curiosity regarding how a group of seemingly sensible people can go so far down the wrong road. Just like classical newtonian physics, experimental results confirm quantum theory to the best of our knowledge right now. But since the Heisenberg principal is a non-sequiter, replacing epistemology (""we can't know"") with metaphysics (""it doesn't exist""), we know something is missing and if the history of science has anything to teach, its that going forward without understanding can lead to crazy ideas. This is definately the largest house of cards I've ever seen."
4,"Best Cosmological read since ""A Brief History of Time""",Excellent insight...A must for the die hard physics fan
3,Good Introduction/Skims the Top,"The Elegant Universe was nicely written and fairly easy to stay interested in, however; anyone looking for deep explanation or justification need not look here. Greene's explanation of general relativity and quantum mechanics are excellent and easily comprehensible, with analogies that translate normally complex topics.String theory, the book's topic, remains a mystery even after Greene's explanations. He uses a laundry list of facts rather than the insightful explanations that had made the earlier sections on Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity an enlightening experience. As a high school student with a particular interest in Physics, I can say that anyone longing for the how and why will find no solace in this book."
2,No Figures,"Although the book is very enlightenting and entertaining, the Kindle edition does not have the Figures and illustrations referred to in the text. This is a serious omission, and would suggest you do not buy the Kindle edition."
5,"Brilliant, beautiful exposition",This is a really inspiring book. It's a huge credit to the author that his survey of some of the deepest and most advanced frontiers of human inquiry is so lucid and readable. It's lucky that someone so central to this research has the ability to create such a successful exposition.
3,Not for beginners,"This book is packed with information, unfortunately it is not the easiest read out there, I give the author credit for trying to get so much into a book, but it is at the cost of keeping things fairly technical."
4,Not a light read but enlightening string theory,"Okay I have to admit that some of the discussion in this book is over my head, way over my head. But having said that the bulk of what is discussed is of interest.Great theoretisist and minds are the source of thinking beyond what is the norm and into what is the truth. This results in ideas that are sometimes hundreds of years in the proving.Not a light read but for anyone interested in string theory a very good place to start to understand how the theory came to be."
5,Brian Greene is a genius....he's also a pretty good physicist,"Wonderful read! This is one of the best books there is for the general reader wanting a solid foundation in quantum physics and the development of string theory (pre 2000). Somehow Greene manages to continually engage the reader for all 400 pages. His analogies for understanding some of the hard to picture concepts, like time behaving as another dimension of space and electrodynamics for instance, are incredible. He is a brilliant writer who genuinely wants his readers to share in his excitement for string theory and never makes the reader feel inferior. His enthusiasm is contagious. I couldn't wait to get ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" which I also highly recommend as well."
3,"Very well written, but dubious subject matter.","To add another review to a book that already has thousands would be superfluous and effusive, which describes me to a ""T."" Suffice it to say that Dr. Greene has written a work about a system of scientific thought that is inherently complex, cumbersome and not at all well understood; yet his book makes it approachable. However, the upshot of this piece is the glaring realization that string theory (in whatever permutation one wishes to define it) is less a theory and more of a hypothesis, as none of it can be substantiated nor disproved via experimental rigor. Without further ado; 3 stars."
2,Vaporware,"This book, and string theory itself, is like the ultimate software demo: very slick, glitzy, claims to do everything, will solve all your problems, makes you want to go place an order for the product right now. Only with a little digging do you find out that the engineers haven't even written a line of working code, and haven't even figured out how to implement the basic algorithms. My advice: wait for the beta version."
1,Lacking,The book presents interesting but fragmented ideas. It lacks a good argument why string theory was promising in 2000. The anecdotes are irrelevant and distracting.
4,"mind expanding view of ""reality""","Searching for the ""answer""? Well this book opens up a whole new way of seeing ""reality"". Mr. Greene gives an account of the search for the ultimate theory which most anyone can follow and get a feel for the importance of what it all means. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in Quantum physics or any other high energy physics"
2,Modern Philosophy,"Aristotle tried to explain the universe by describing transparent sphere's. Today's philosophers are using strings. These theorists are not to be confused with the true mental giants of Newton, and Einstien. The beauty of these theories is that you can't prove nor disprove any of their ideas, making for a great way of getting grant money to support yourself and looking important all at the same time. You need 11 dimensions in order for string theory to work, but 3/4's of the book uses a 6 dimensional shape to try and explain how string theory might work. If you play with math formulaes long enough, you can come up with any answer you want. Don't bother to read this book,( Although Brian Greene is a good story teller. ) but wait until string theory has been proven. In other words don't bother yourself with string theory, its a waste of time as none of it can be proven."
3,A fine addition to your coffee table,"In the tradition of Steven Hawking, Professor Greene brings us this fine addition to the blossoming field of coffee-table science. Get a nice warm fuzzy without ever having to so much as learn calculus. Physics goes Hollywood."
2,Silly book,"There is nothing to be gained from this silly book if you have already read layman introductions to relativity and quantum mechanics. I got a chuckle reading the final chapter 'Prospects' where the author admits string theorists make wild assumptions about the nature of spacetime at the planck length and that present day mathematics are woefully inadequate to tackle the various problems. So what are you as a layman left with? Nothing, because Greene admits the underlying principles behind M-Theory (the theory formerly known as string theory) are unknown. Don't be fooled by all the wonderful reviews. Most are buying this book as a ornament mean't to impress other people."
5,Very well written,One of my favorite books. Very well written and entertaining. I've got a background in maths so this review is not aimed at people who don't have a similar background.
5,EXTREME PRAISE from a fellow author and student .,"I am a physician anesthesiologist and author who has always been empassioned by astrophysics. Dr. Greene has been working with me in a tutorial fashion on the mathematics involved. He has an unbelievable talent for taking seemingly obscure and otherwise difficult concepts, boiling them down to wonderful descriptions that make you say ""oh why didn't I think of it that way..."". His whole book is like that...amazing...the guy is brilliant and yet can communicate these concepts in plain English better than anyone I have read. Bravo Dr. Greene!!!... Ken Giuffre MD, author of ""The Care and Feeding of Your Brain"" (Career Press 1999)."
5,Absolutely First Rate,"I had to read each chapter three times: first time through carefully, second time through with a pen to underline the important parts, and then a third time to remind myself of what I had read.Does that sound like a lot of work? Well, I absolutely loved it. No book has held my interest with such passion in years.Fantastically interesting material, beautifully written about."
5,Good read,"This is a well done book. The author did a good job expanding it to all readers. I am a math and engineering student and I was able to use the mathematical explanations in the back to add more to my understanding of the explanations. Despite the complexity of the subject and the math behind it, I think my mother would enjoy reading this (with exception maybe of chapter 5) the examples he gives and his style of writing is east to follow for anyone. You don't need to be a genius to read this book. You just need an interest. I give it 5 stars for what it is!"
3,Not exactly a Quantum Physics for Dummies book,"Since I am more a right-brained person than left (I consider myself middle of the road, though), this lost me. I'll find myself reading several pages then have no clue how to explain what I just read. Seems to take several chapters just to explain why the book is written. If anyone knows a good QP for Dummies (or artists) books, please let me know. I do find it an interesting topic and would like to explore it more. The Divine Matrix by Braden is a good beginning."
5,An excellent layman's summary,"If you're interested in the workings (or, at least the theoretical workings) of the universe, but don't want to get bogged down in the 'mathiness' of it all, then this is the right book for you. Dr. Greene's writing style is full of helpful analogies and descriptions that take the abstract concepts of Superstring and M theory and makes them solid."
3,Interesting Intro to Astrophysics,"This is a good introduction to astrophysics and theories. Brian Greene's books are very readable and overall I enjoyed the book. Unfortunately Brian Greene, like so many other physicists and funders of research, is also obviously quite enamored of M-Theory (or String Theory). The chapters focusing on these subjects often end up being ""excited apologies"" as at first he points out how exciting M-theory would be - if physicists actually could even develop, let alone prove, the theory or one of the 10^500 possible formulations - and then follows that up with the apologetic fact that, for the next few centuries at least, we will likely not see any actual theory formulated and will have no way to prove it. But overall, the book is a good primer on the current world of astrophysics."
5,Good history and introduction -- no math,"If you have been reading lay physics books, about half of this one will be review. The rest is a great presentation of where string theory is up to 1999. I would have liked to see more equations, (about the only math in the book are in the footnotes, and those are well-known formulas) but Greene is clearly wary of frightening the average bookstore browser off. It is also possible (he does mention this) that the math is so complicated that there is no way to provide a cohesive introduction. Still, I would very much recommend this book to anyone who is the slightest bit interest."
5,Incredible,This book portrays these complicated ideas of modern physics in a simple and enjoyable way. It is surprisingly clear and makes you enjoy material that could otherwise be seen as tedious. Briane Greene's enthusiasm leaps out of the pages making you feel the pure joy of comprehension and letting you see some of the universe's simple beauty.
5,Great Book!,This book gave me a very good overview of modern physics and where the physics community is headed in the coming years. Descriptions of physical theories are presented with easy to understand analogies for those with little to no background in physics.
4,Just perfect!,The book really helped me understand the basic principles behind the topic. It was very thorough but not too complex in it's explanations. I wish it had gone a little deeper into the formulas. Overall I enjoyed this book.
1,Really Hard to Follow - Even for a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry,"I felt that this book was, unfortunately, like many popularizations of physics(e.g. Brief History of Time ): ok in the first few chapters and then losing the reader entirely after that. I saw Professor Greene give a lecture and went on to try to read the book. After the first few chapters I felt that the analogies that seem to garner so much praise from other reviewers did not make much sense to me. I kept wondering why anyone would do this if there seems to be no possibility of testing the theories experimentally. I do not think that Professor Greene majes a coherent case that this research is important or worthwhile."
5,High energy physics for the rest of us,"I found this to be both fascinating and understandable. While some of the analogies are a bit strained, most of them work very well to illustrate the complex hypotheses. Really a good book."
5,The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene,"I loved it because I have already taken one course on nuclear physics. Greene starts out giving great examples that anyone without a background in nuclear physics could understand . However, as he progresses towards the end discussing superstring theory, there are less and less examples, probably because it is so abstract. In any case, it is certainly worth the Amazon price of $3.99."
5,Information about our Universe,Excelent book to inform you about the latest avances in Physics.-Get you familiar with strings theory and other dimensions: fascinating!!!
2,Not recommended!,"At the risk of getting hanged & quartered by admirers of Gardner Dozois, I must state that if THIS is the ""best"" of sci-fi for an entire year, then the genre has sunk in its intellectual pseudo-highbrow psychological stew, trying to get rid of the taut narrative-based sails that had kept the genre afloat. Just compare these stories with the Hall of Flame collections, and get to see the difference."
5,Good Book,"Best ear ever. Some years have had stories better then the ones that are in this book, but quantity of good stories was better then any other year. If you've read any of Dozois' yearly collections then you need to read this one!"
3,Where are the women?,"This is the second anthology I've read edited by Dozois and I am sorely disappointed in the paucity of women writers. Four out of 28 is hardly representative of the women writing in sf today. Just look at the honorable mentions in the back and one can see that they are writing and well represented in the field. His other anthology failed in this respect, also. Though many of the stories were strong there were a few I thought mediocre. Bill Johnson's ""We will drink a fish together..."" was tedious and the characters poorly developed. The story line was not all that original either. Greg Egan's ""Reasons to be cheerful"" was a unique look at the drawbacks and advances in modern medicine. Nancy Kress's story was, as always, exceptional. I would like to see more women writers in the next anthology. I may not buy another otherwise."
3,Third Ear Band - 'Magic Music' (Materiali Sonori) 3 1/2 stars,"Very cool,later day 1998 reunion release by the Third Ear Band.In fact,I can honestly say this effort is at least as good as a couple of their earlier works,the self titled lp,often refered as 'Elements' and 'MacBeth'(see my reviews of both).Best described as experimental/progressive art rock.Third Ear Band,once again manages to create their own sound,vibe,mood and tone to cross two musical genres here,Middle Eastern and Indian Raga.Tracks I found to be most astounding were ""Behind The Pyramid"",the chanting ""Solstice Song"" and the twelve-minute epic ""Sun Ra Raga"".Line-up:Glenn Sweeney-drummer,Lynn Dobson-sax,chants&vocals,Mick Carter-guitar&violin and Neil Black-oboe.You gotta check this title out.A should-have."
5,An Extremely Good Combination TV and VCR,"This is one of the finest combination TV-VCRs I have seen in a while. Panasonic makes very good 9inch TVs. One reason for the incredible picture quality is that the electron gun can keep very accurate control on a smaller screen size delivering crisper and cleaner images. VHS tapes look amazingly good. This compact unit has 2 Video Heads, allows Time-shift Recording and Index Search. It also has Front audio-video jacks, a Headphone Jack, V-chip parental control and Remote Control. The TV Tuner is 181-channel TV/CATV compliant. Many of the shopping warehouse clubs around the country use this model to demonstrate their videos that they sell at their locations. These TVs look great, check them out."
4,Surprised,I was pleasantly surprised by this movie... Extremely entertaining and well done. Theh characters were well acted and the plot held my attention. The entire family can watch the movie and enjoy the content and history of the first king of Sweeden.
2,careful -- this is a botched version,"So from the descriptions I was led to believe I had purchased the uncut swedish version of this film. Instead what I got was a combination of two films cut into half. the first part is pretty good -- it tells a good story and the acting is reasonably compelling (some very good actors in the cast), esp the young woman who plays Cecilie. Nice settings also. But in the second part it just became AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN with very little explanation of how the plot fitted together.So in my judgment you are far better off reading the original ARN trilogy by Jean Guillou, which is finally available in English. That is a really fine example of historical fiction set in the early middle ages. Fans of that type of historical novel will enjoy the story and the off-beat setting (medieval Sweden)."
2,don't know swedish,Was very disappointed when I found that what I received was in the Swedish language with English subtitles. I was under the assumption that this was in English since the trailers I had seen for it was in English.
3,Okay but not great,"For what it is its okay, the story suffers because of the obviously low budget and they could have done some more research on the Knights Templar, the battle scenes lacked the epic quality I was hoping for again for budgetary reasons. But at least the equipment was period."
1,about as exciting as a cup of cold spit.,"save your money, The scenes are predictable and the dialog is trite. There are better movies out there than this one.."
1,No text to speech is a deal killer,"I'm waiting for this book and the next three in the Kincaid/James series to be text-to-speech enabled. Until they are, they're useless to me."
4,Want more of Kincaid and James,"ALL SHALL BE WELL by Deborah Crombie's 2nd installment in the series will keep you waiting for the next to be published.A neighbor is dead--suffering from terminal lung cancer Jasmine Dent's death is a blessing. Duncan Kincaid, a neighbor who discover the body suspects the demise was earlier than it should have been and he is in a position to set things right.Kincaid with the help of his assistant Gemma James begin an investigation that leads them to a twist of good and evil.Ms. Crombie is an excellent story telling in the British style.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
3,Enjoyable,It's rare that a crime series makes sense and this one is no exception. I enjoyed the story but had to suspend my disbelief almost from the start.Do detectives run across murders in their own lives as happens in the first two installments of this series. Of course not.Otherwise this is an enjoyable book with an interesting backstory. I will probably continue on in the series when I'm looking for easy escapism.
2,Too Many Loose Ends,"This is the second Deborah Crombie I've read, as I intended to work my way through the series. It is definitely a better book than the first, but still weak in its development of character and plot. The 'plot', in fact, wandered all over the place, with all sorts of possibilities being raised, then these being left in mid-air as the book closed with the most obvious candidate being indicted. Very unsatisfying.I have lived in London for 6 years, and I could immediately tell that Ms Crombie is not English - she just does not connect with how people are in England. Elizabeth George is much better at this.Deborah Crombie, judged by her first 2 books, is not nearly in the same league as P.D. James, Ruth Rendell, Minette Walters, Peter Robinson, Linda la Plante or Elizabeth George.In summary - a pleasant enough read, but with too many loose ends not at all satisfying."
3,I Enjoyed This One More than the first.,"This second book in the Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James mystery series, I found more entertaining than the first. I still would not put Ms. Crombie on the same level anywhere near Elizabeth George or Martha Grimes. Her characterizations cannot compare with either of these illustrious ladies, as far as I'm concerned. Also, I just didn't feel the ""Englishness"" in this book. It didn't read like an authentic British novel. In this book Duncan sets out to find out if his terminally ill neighbour was killed or whether she committed suicide. I must admit that I had the murderer figured out about half way through. I will still pesevere with this series, but am sadly disappointed."
3,Love Her Later Work,"I made the mistake of starting with one of Crombie's more recent books and have been catching up on her earlier books after the fact. I think she has improved with writing experience and some of her earlier books lack the depth and attention grabbing detail she is now capable of creating, so this was a bit of a slog and I was happy to finish it but have not ordered the next one she wrote."
4,Very good mystery,Ms. Crombie writes a great police procedural. She really makes you feel par to the geography and style of London's communities.
2,Be careful,"Her music itself is beautiful with comfortably mellow disco flavor. However, in my case, somehow this album wss not CD, but CDr with no complete artwork in the case. It is disappointing."
4,"I would have given this five stars, but...","There are wonderful to look at and everyone said they were so cute. I would totally buy these again. I do have one tiny issue and that is that the handles are a little small. It is hard to grip especially the triangular shaped ones. But other than that, they're great."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this product with the hope it would fade light age spots and very minor spider veins. I used the product every day for four months and never saw any results.Are there any fade cream products that really work, I have tried several?Linda"
5,"Vegas: the Third Season, Vol 2","Vegas:the Third Season, Vol 2 was what I had been waiting for. Hope the remaining seasons of the series will be released very soon. A great series. The series can be funny, serious, and I love Twoleaf and Tony Curtis whenever they appear."
3,"Love Vega$, but...","First off, as has been stated many times in reviews about the six (rip-off!!!) half-seasons, the nostalgic pleasures of seeing Las Vegas before it veered off into steroid-like development hell is worth it even if the plots were akin to the A-Team. The plots in Season 3, part 2 may not have been cartoonish, but they were, in my humble opinion, even more banal than what preceeded them. Also, the transfer quality left something to be desired as these episodes are clearly not as crystal clear as the other releases of Vega$."
5,The Blessing Workbook,"This is an excellent tool, which takes you step by step in learning how to give possitive affirmation to those around you, but most important it helps you find out if you have, or if you are receiving the possitive affirmation that helps you to understand what is missing in your life. This is a workbook, you can go at your own pace, you can work by yourself, with another person or in a small group, This workbook makes you face yourself and think."
3,good product,The item was exactly as described and was received in a timely manner. The only problem was that the 3 items were packed too tight so that one of the containers broke and spilled into the shipping box...The box was sealed so that there was no problem in product quality. Will buy from them again
5,Cats Love Them Also.,"My cats love these chicken nibbles. A one pound container lasts about seven to eight months. That's for two cats. This container may last a year if you only have one cat. There are a lot of treats in the container. I don't feed them these everyday. If you do feed them to your cats I have found that it is easier for them to eat if you break up the treat into four little pieces. My only concern was that they are made in China. The label says 100% chicken breast but I can't help but think there is something else in them. At just under $20 including shipping, I think it's a great value. You can also find these in your local pet stores however I have never seen them at places like Target or the grocery store."
5,Yummy treat for dogs,"I took my pomeranian to the Vet to have stitches removed. The Vet had these treats sitting in a jar on his counter. My dog, shaking,anxious and probably ready to nip the Vet loved these treats and while eating them it took her mind totally off what the Vet was doing. Of course I had to go purchase them and now it is by far my dog's favorite treat. I also give them during her training sessions and she thoroughly enjoys her rewards."
1,These don't expand to fit all wine bottles,"I previously had a chrome wine stopper purchased from another store, but it was damaged by falling into an active garbage disposal, so I bought these as replacements. The previous stopper had a thick rubber part that created the seal. The rubber sections on these are so thin that they didn't even seal the wine bottle I first tried them on. All three stoppers in the set had the same problem.Oxygen and leakage are death to a wine, so a stopper that doesn't seal is worse than just replacing the cork."
4,Price is right,"Very good value. Would have given 5 stars if top were a couple of inches wider and deeper, it would help if bottom were a little longer so it would stay in jar better. Would not hesitate to recomend."
4,Fts well with my widemouth Mason Jars,Fits well with my wide mouth mason jars. Great for sauces especially! I do not use it for heat canning but for vacuum storage.
4,His best?,While this may not be his best album it is pretty good and enjoyable. Some fine drumming from Billy Higgins as well.
3,Not as good as you would think.......,"Any book about farting should be better than this. My kid thought it would involve pooping, too, but it didnt ... it was dissappointing that way. farting is still funny , though. thanks amazon.com."
4,not as good as the original,"We have three Walter the Farting Dog books, the first is the best, followed by Walter the Farting Dog Trouble at the Yard Sale and Rough Weahter Ahead for Walter the Farting Dog. My kids are 5 and 8 and this book gets them giggling, just saying Professor Kompressor gets me giggling a little too. Walter is a very sweet dog with a lot of gas, which tends to get him into a little trouble, but the kids love him anyway. This book as well as the others, have a good lesson in unconditional love and acceptance. Fun book, not too long, interesting if not a little weird artwork. But the kids love it."
1,spare us the latin edition of this one.,"My kids liked the first Walter book, but didn't like this one.The illustrations are even creepier."
2,Its not as GOOD as you THINK,"Any book about farting should be better than this. My kid thought it would involve pooping, too, but it didnt ... it was dissappointing that way. farting is still funny , though. thanks amazon.com."
5,WAlter the farting dog,"FUnny, funny, funny. never laughed so hard in all my life. Great trans action, my grandkids loved the book as they are intothinkingfartingis funny."
5,Essential Reading for Disciples,"It is quite clear that modern Christians, especially mainline Protestants, have become biblically illiterate -- this is true despite great advancements in historical and theological study of the Bible. Eugene Boring, who is an accomplished New Testament scholar, wrote this book in 1997 for the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). He shares here the way in which a faith community that has rooted itself in Scripture, especially New Testament, studied and made use of this text.At the close of the book he offers important advice as to how a community of faith can reengage with Scripture and over come its tendency toward illiteracy. If we're going to talk theologically as a community that is non-creedal, then we must understand that resource that stands at the center of our faith.This is essential reading! And just to make a play on the author's name -- this book is in no way boring!!"
5,Terrific book for the serious Atlantic salmon fisher!,"This is definitely not just another rehash of the 'standard' flies described in so many books. These flies are those usually available only palm-to-palm at the edge of the river, or at the tailgate after a day's fishing. Fly photographs are excellent, with great descriptive and background text. This is a rare opportunity to peruse the flyboxes of Eastern Canada's most skilled tyers and fishermen. A nice bonus is the inclusion of contact information for all the contributing tyers. Kudos, Paul- a great piece of work!"
1,Can i give this garbage a 0 rating?,"This is one of the worst albums i have heard in a long time, it is nothing but 2 guys screaming, and the guitaring is too loud and too fast for my liking. If you want a decent album buy S Club's greatest hits."
1,I hope they read this,"it sux when you buy a cd, wait for it to come in the mail,bc people say its awesome, then finally it comes in! A cd for .76 cents, u think that this is great!....At first i figured ""well if it does suck...i didnt spend that much money on it."" When i popped this album in i felt *****ng stupid for spending that whole .76 cents on it. It was so horrible i had to punch my mother! IT IS THAT BAD! Stay away from this band.....they suck! Raging Speedhorn.....I want my money back!"
4,This is a damn good debut album,"The last time I heard a great debut album was ""burn my eyes"" and machine head only got better. Not to compare R/S to M/H, but the same is true. R/S will only get better, and for their debut to sound this good will only make you think how great this band will become. Two vocalists who sound like they want to take the world down with them and blistering guitar and drums make this a tight little package that will knock your head off."
2,Kinda Contradicting The Guy Below...,"There COULD be potential, but at the end of the day for a band to be good at the moment, they have to have variation. There is not one single chilled out song on this album, and with 2 singers you'd think that there would more experimentation with the vocals. Both singers just shout and there is not one single sung note. Take a look at many other bands at the moment - earthtone9, Machine Head, Deftones, Deadlights - they are all really heavy with shouting but contain singing as well. Dont get me wrong, I like heavy, shouty aggressive music but a 10 track album needs to give the listener something else as well. If you want more heavy music then by all means buy this, but the songs are far too similar compared to loads of other cool, heavy bands. Old school metal bands (Pantera, Slayer, early Machine Head, Entombed) are far better.This is just overhyped and musically simple."
4,Useful for Herb Gardeners,"The first three sections cover the history, culture, propagation and uses of herbs. The last section (23 pages) lists herbs by their common name (anise to yarrow) and gives growing instructions for each. It also includes its height, soil requirments, exposure, propagation and uses.The photos are black and white, so not as useful as color ones would be.I liked the planting suggestions for shady areas, for a hillside, and for a formal garden plus others."
2,Difficult to set properly.,"It is difficult to adjust the Prizm properly. I spent three weeks bouncing between three conditions. 1) Filling with water, 2) Not collecting anything and 3) Properly collecting skimmate.I finally gave up and purchased an Aqua-C Remora Pro. The Remora worked perfectly right out of the box! The Remora doesn't need adjustments, which is a good thing, there is nothing to adjust."
1,horrible experience,"I used this skimmer for about 10 months. It was horrible. The plastic is too dark to properly set the microbubble level. Many, many times I thought I had it set correctly, only to find it had overflowed a 1/2 hour later. It NEVER collected much, even when I was lucky enough to have set it correctly. Towards the end, it kept losing siphon, so it would run maybe 3 hours before it stopped pulling in any water to skim. I switched to a Coralife skimmer, and in 2 days, I swear I had collected more skimmate than in the previous 10 months combined. It was a huge waste of money."
2,Outdated Material (I agree with the previous reviewer.),"I agree with the last reviewer who found this book out of date. I've had the same experience in my cross-country travels of finding closed/non existent restaurants, and I'm one of the contributors to the book! I've crossed out many of the entries in my copy and know of several new vegetarian restaurants that opened since.It's not that this is a bad book. On the contrary, it contains the names, addresses, phone numbers, descriptions, prices, etc. of restaurants, plus information on vacation spots. But like an old phone book, this type of information quickly goes out of date and needs frequent updating. There are websites where you can get up-to-date vegetarian restaurant information for free."
2,Incorrect Merchandise,"The license plate I ordered showed the ram symbol in red and there were no letters on it. THe one I received was black and the word ""RAM"" on each side. I drive a dodge charger and would not have ordered anything with RAM on it."
4,As described.,Nice chrome surround that makes the license plate look smarter with having a dealers private advertisement on your car. Looks good but only time will tell with the chrome quality.
4,"Great book, but where's the index?","I loved this book, it is helpful to my collecting and my selling. It has wonderful pictures, and I love the section on '60's makers and just the way it is arranged in general is helpful and makes for fascinating reading. The only thing I would like to see with this book is a name index; this would make it so much more helpful as a reference. I do highly recommend it though, as a reference or just as a coffee table book."
4,Yet Another Hawaiian Shirt Book,"OK -- I buy all these books. They're all OK, not the ultimate. This one is also a good book for us collectors. It adds to the knowledge we all crave."
4,Christmas order,"I got the product very quickly and it was a success.It however was not what I expected, the description shouldhave been more detailed.Thanks"
3,good idea and quality but not worth,"i review from europe, i am driving an opel(vauxhall) and no matter how i try, the transmitter did not fit the lighter!Although sansa seem to be avare of that possibility(there are many adapter rubbers in the package) i believe ,acceptably, their main concern was american customers.Another problem was that i couldn't find a frequency clean enough to listen my music without a disturbing noise.So, while listening i wondered why i bought this instead of using an casette adapter etc.."
2,Don't buy this stuff,"The sound quality is really awful!! I gave it a two star, because I give credit to the other aspects of the product like the casing, the gooseneck support, and the fact that it is easy to turn it back on when it loses its power. HOwever, the most important thing is the sound quality, which really is very, very poor."
1,Bad reception,"I bought this transmitter for my Sansa mp3, but to my disappointment there was very bad reception, way too much static. I would NOT recommend this product."
3,I was happy till it fell apart,"This was an awesome item, or so I thought till it came apart when i went to driving. The connection between the cigarette base and the thick bendable wire that help my MP3 play became disconnected when I took a turn. Upon taking a closer look the only thing that kept the two pieces togther was a little piece of black tape with glue. I am not happy about that. I have had to have it repaired by someone else in order for it to stay together. But other than that the transmitter worked well."
1,I can't beieve I bought this!,"At 1st look this device looks well made. The mp3 player fits perfectly and the flexible arm adjusts easily.However, the sound that comes out of it is unfit for human consumption! It doesn't matter which frequency I choose, it sounds like a 10 cent radio. I tried it in my other car with a better sound system and it sounded even worse.It is going back as soon as I can get it in the mail!!"
2,Disapointment,"I'm very disapointment about this product, I think it look so ugly in my car and doesn't have good sound.Realmente luce muy feo en mi carro, me parece un aparato sin ergonomia y muy mal diseñado, ademas no suena tan bien, se escucha cierta interferencia cuando se le sube el volumenNo lo recomiendo, estoy decepcionado"
4,Very good speakers.,"These speakers have very good sound and they are made very well too. They have nice tweeter and midrange sound but you will definitely need a subwoofer to bring out the sound your looking for. I also like the way they mount to the wall, they dont sit flush with the wall they actually pertrude out so they are even with your flat screen t.v ( thats if you are using them for your t.v surround sound like i am) and they come with two different color screens which are easy to change. Overall they are very good speakers and Im very satisfied with my purchase."
5,a WONDERFUL way to relax after a hard day's work,"Wanted to get something for my brother who likes classical Beethoven, Bach, etc., but wanted to buy it and hear it first. I loved it so much I'm going to get another for myself! I love to listen to it while I'm making dinner or paying bills, as it takes the dullness of the task away and puts me in a great mood."
5,Great stuff!,"I have missed ""Postum"" since they stopped producing it. Now I have a GREAT alternative! Thanks so much, it's GREAT STUFF!"
3,Not quite was I was looking for!,"The manufacturer also makes a better product ""Cafix Instant beverage CRYSTALS"" (7oz. jar) which we previously purchased at a Health Food Coop, was not available thru Amazon at the time we made our recent purchase. The ingredients on the label of the Amazon listed product (powdered) are slightly different and the flavor is slightly less coffee-like, but still a better flavor choice than Postum (discontinued).Also the ""Crystal"" product dissolves a little easier (looks like freeze-dried instant coffee) and does not lump up if the water is too hot as does the powdered product. AMAZON, I HOPE YOU'RE LISTENING. PLEASE STOCK THE OTHER PRODUCT."
3,Not Bad But Could Be Better,I am very sensitive to caffeine so much so that even Sanka coffee can keep me up. I wanted to be able to drink a hot beverage on cold nights or afternoons and not worry that it would keep me up. I tried Cafix. It's a perfectly good substitute for Postum and is very flavorful but to me it has a little bit of an ashy aftertate otherwise I would have given it a 4 or 5 rating.
5,love cafix!,"I decided I wanted to give up caffeine because I noticed drinking coffee affected my sleeping habits. It was hard because I really do love the taste of coffee. I tried Cafix and I absolutely LOVE it! It tastes just like coffee, I would compare it to instant coffee, just a smoother non acidic taste. Very good! Highly recommend it!!!!! Add a little milk and stevia and you are good to go!"
4,"Cafix, an excellent substitue for coffee!","When my doctor said I was to totally stop my caffiene intake, I didn't know what to do, especially for that hot cup in the morning. When I discovered Cafix was a coffee substitute, and totally caffiene free, I decided to try it. It's great!"
3,rgs3,"It is a good thing to have if you live in the middle of nowhere like I do, but otherwise I do not reccomend buying this product. We had ours for a year then the cord completely ripped out of the plug. Very cheaply made."
2,Portable Compressor,"This is a very durable little compressor, but don't think it will inflate anything to 300 PSI. It works well within half that capacity."
1,Use To Be A Good Unit But Now MADE IN Communist CHINA,I have owned couple of these compressors in the last several years and they work Great but the last one that I bought was definitely a Cheapened version Made In Communist China. These compressors were Made In USA up til a couple of years ago. I guess Interdynamics prefers Slave Labor by a Communist Country over the good ole USA the Country that made them what they are.
1,air compressor,Bought 2 of these. Both failed at extactly the same time after a few months. Save your money.
2,"Initially worked fine, but then...","I liked this product when I first got it. Worked well to inflate car or bike tires. But after only about a year of use, the air hose started to leak (the unit was well cared for), and since it is a cheap, press-on unit, it can't easily be fixed. I am buying a different brand this time because I have now gone through two of these in a few years of occasional use. That doesn't cut it for me."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I didn't expect great quality from the 2 copies of this Bible that I bought for my kids because of the price. I didn't want to spend a lot of money because kids tend to lose or misplace things a lot, but I was pleasantly surprised. The binding is very durable and the snap cover works well. They like the size, and I like the size of the text because it is not small and it was easy to read. I would purchase these again in a heart beat."
1,Large Print? Beware.,Maybe this is large print to you but not in my book. I feel it misleads to call it such. What I do know is that there are 10 lines per inch - you can make up your own mind.-Great price but for my going blind friend it helps not.
2,KJV Large Print Compact Bible (Black bonded leather????),"While I agree that this is larger print, the supposed ""leather"" feels like vinyl. I could have returned the book but it allowed me to have 2 KJV's at work within reach. I feel that it's poorer quality binding was overpriced. I just wish the description had been what this binding feels like."
4,Pretty good book to know .Net FrameWork,"I liked this book pretty much. Contents are well organized and clearly described. Lots of pointers to good reference materials for topics discussed and not discussed. Gives an indepth knowledge of how objects are created and handled. It's pretty interesting and you can't just keep the book down.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know .Net FrameWork either a beginner or experienced.Note: Knowing framework well really helps to write good programming, rather than just knowing a language."
3,We will cover it later.,"I can't really understand how people rate this book so high. The only thing I can say good about it is, it gives you a general idea what .NET framework includes. Very disorganized, lots of ""and there is that but we will cover it later,below etc.."". No comprehensive samples. All you can do with this book is to learn what you can do, but if you want to learn how to do it as well, go buy something else. Unfortunaltely this is what happens if you want to squeeze a whole platform into a single book."
4,"Great Deal, less Flat Screen View",This is a great product for the cost. I bought the DVD and this combo makes it possible for me to view every kind of Videos. Flat screen makes it better but then for this cost its a good deal. Review the technical data and u would definitely find the features u r looking for in this product. I am a student and might have been just gone for a cheap deal for this combo but once u see it then u would believe me. Go to the nearest dealer and see the product urself and u would really like it.
5,The mini series was excellent,This mini series is very close to the one in the early 80's that was the best ever made. I would definitely recommend this to lovers of history.
4,Marco Polo,"Understanding that this person, Marco Polo, may never have seen China as he said he did, I fully enjoyed this story. It was very believable as well as interesting."
5,Good movie,We missed the second half of Marco Polo on TV so I was excited when I found it at Amazon. We don't have many DVD's but this is a part of history so we've watched it twice so far. So much to learn of a mysterious culture. I would recomend it to any history buff.
2,Two reviews,"Two reviews come to mind for this one: 1) ""Low budget, low energy, big yawn""; and, 2) ""Brian Dennehy as Kublai Khan."" They tried, others have tried, no one's done justice to M. Polo since M. Polo first told his story. This one throws in some sex and B.D. Wong gets a martial arts airing. Two stars, one for each review."
5,Terrific Adventure,"I really enjoyed this book. First, I have to mention the design because it contributes to the reading experience. The cover, the sepia drawings and photos and the ruffle edge pages all are remind the reader of an old voyage log. The story is great. The adventure, the discomoforts(the Alaska back country in July is not nice)the sights and sounds are amazing. It is a very exciting book. Despite the hardships the men are very upbeat and bathe the whole trip in prayer. I decided to read Call of the Wild afterwards."
1,Disapointed,"I wish I had not bought this slicer. It is difficult to work out which blade does what, it is tricky to use (I have cut myself more than once) and it is not possible to alter the size of slices. I wish I had spent a little more and got a regular mandoline with a variable blade. I never bother with it now -- but the stainless steel bowl is handy!"
1,Not worth it even on sale,I complete regret getting the Hoffritz Mandoline slicer. I thought it would be nice to have the attaching bowl but it actually is annoying. The slicer should be in an incline so when you slice it's comfortable and clean. The interchangable blades are easy to insert but hard as hell to pull out. Very dangerous. I ended up ditching the Hoffritz and getting the Japanese made mandoline slicer. Works like a dream.
1,To Good to be True!,"Of course I should have known that you're not going to get a decent mandoline slicer for under $20, and this product proves it! Mine also came with a defect which blocked insertion of the cutting blades which I stupidly took the time to fix, cutting myself in the process. My advice is to forget about this item!"
3,mandoline,"Not the greatest, but I read the reviews beforehand.It does work very easily and the blade is sharp (for now)I would recommed for the price.I really love the free gift, the peeler and knife!"
3,Works but scary,"Sharp-sharp-sharp. The force required either broke the food or got jammed until I figured out a solution. Place the item on edge to acheive the narrowest profile to reduce cutting effort. Cut large items into smaller profiles as well. Don't attempt to slice last remnant--you can't get enough traction. Rather, hand slice or turn on edge and be careful-careful-careful.The bowl doesn't accomodate the cuttings of large stiff items as it hits the rim before being completely cut. Reduce the length or use the left edge which allows a little more length."
1,Hoffritz Isn't What It Used To Be!!!,The Hoffritz Mandoline is an embarrassment to German know-how and technology.My wife's first experience with her Hoffritz Mandoline X-mas present was nothing short of a first class fiasco. The blade was so dull that she had to push a potato so hard that the blade got past the bubble stopper. The blade got stuck in this position and could not be removed. I was unable to reach Customer Service@Hoffritz by email because of an outdated Web page. Whatever happened to the Hoffritz quality standards?
2,A Not so hot kitchen tool!,"I kept this Hoffritz Mandoline for one week and then returned it to Amazon.com. The stainless bowl is nice but the feet do NOT keep it from moving around on the counter. Worst of all, if you push the slicer plates in just a little bit too far, they get stuck in the top and you cannot get them out. As two of the slicers have blades on them, it is dangerous to be trying to force the blades out of the top. Two of the tabs on the slicers were defective so those two plates were getting jammed every time I used them. The machine did slice cucumbers and onions beautifully but then when I couldn't get the slicer apart, I forgot all about what a good job it really did! I don't have time to waste on products that don't function well so it was sent back!"
2,Never owned a mandoline before...,"I am writing this from the view of someone who has never used a mandoline before. I brought the Hoffritz hoping that it would simplify my chopping jobs - unfortunately, it turned out to be more trouble than its worth. First, the material to be chopped have to be prepared before it can be loaded into the holder - an awkward process in itself since the holder is rather small and in the time that it takes to prepare the material for the holder I could have finish chopping it already. In addition, I didn't think the blades were as sharp as some of the other post mentioned - it did ok on chopping green pepper but mangled onion and sausage when I tried those. I wish that I could have liked it, but as it stands now, the mandoline is going into the basement storage bin.To its credit, it does come with a very nice stainless steel bowl, and the whole design is quite steady. I just wish they improve on the holder and the blade."
2,I'm a Rotten Cook,"I'm always looking for something to make the torture of mealtime easier. This isn't it. The plastic insert blades get stuck in the holder. The rubber feet don't hold if you are pressing something which is hard to cut. I haven't tried any fancy cuts yet, just the thick and thin, but I remain unimpressed. The stainless bowl is nice, especially with the lid."
1,Not Worth It,"I have used this mandoline about 10 or 12 times and have yet to get it to work satisfactorily. Yes, the blade is sharp and it cuts cleanly. But the cutting guides that insert into the lid to create the various shapes do not latch in and are positioned too far from the blade. This prevents the product from being cut evenly. The slide mechanism crushes vegetables. I would never recommend this piece of equipment."
2,"Honestly, a good chef's knife is much more efficient","It is not as versatile as you would think. It only does limited sizes of slices and juliennes(either super skinny or giant thick steak fries size/ very thin or very thick slices). There is no adjustments to change thickness of cuts. The blades looks dangerously sharp, especially if you have to struggle (as I did) to remove the blades for cleaning. I only used it twice, place it back in the box and have not used it since. If you own a good chef's knife you can do much more than with this gadget. The bowl and plastic lids seems to be the only thing I would reuse again. If you want to buy a mandoline, spend the big bucks and get the real thing."
1,will not slice,"I have liked mandoline slicers but have been disappointed in the composition and the tendency to break. Thinking that a stainless steel one would be better I purchased this one. It is awkward, the depth guides do not work and the result is a mess. It is a nice stainless steel bowl however. Keep the bowl and throw out the slicer."
2,dangerous piece of cr*p,"This thing is hard to use, hard to clean, and impossible to store safely. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this horrible kitchen accessory. We threw ours away and are happier for it."
2,Slicer not a mandoline,There are only two thickness settings. The thin setting is verry thin. The bowl has feet to keep it from slipping. The main fault is lack of thickness choices.
4,Caution: sharp,"The blades on this mandoline are very sharp. It is very easy to cut yourself while trying to put the blades onto the holder, and especially while trying to get the blades off. The mandoline slices well, but I lost a fair amount of vegetables because the holder prevents you from slicing the last part of the vegetable."
3,Help!,"I've put together and used the slicer once. It takes a few swipes of the blade to get the hang of it, but for the price it works pretty well. BUT now that it's together, I (actually, two of us) can't get it apart to switch the blades. Has anyone figured out how to do this?"
2,Frightening,"This looks more like a medieval torture device than a kitchen tool. Notwithstanding the bowl, which is a nice feature, we are returning it. Until the food you're cutting is small enough for the holder to slide on the device, one winds up having to hold the food in hand. There goes the idea of protecting your hand. And never did I imagine that the blades would be so exposed."
2,"Julienned fingers, anyone?","Ok, sure, I fell for the appeal of a food processor at the price of the Ronco Pocket Banana Peeler. What a mistake!Yes, you can slice veggies such as carrots, cucumbers, etc. evenly, but that is also easy to do with a knife! But for julienne slices of carrot or potato, forget it. This thing is HAZARDOUS! It's a wonder I didn't julienne a finger along with the potatoes. Save your cash and buy a food processor instead -- I recommend a Kitchenaid."
4,Gets the job done,"I like the non-slip bowl -- in fact I often use it as just a bowl without the slicer, it's a good size and shape for lots of things. It's a little difficult to change inserts in the slicer, but once you've got the right one in, slicing is quick and easy."
4,Practice makes perfect!,"After reading the mixed reviews on this product, I decided to risk the 20 bucks. At first, slicing was awkward, and I nearly cut off my thumb. After that, I learned to respect the slicer-- to give it my undivided attention and to carefully consider the best and safest ways to slice each vegetable. I discovered that it was I, not the slicer, that had been awkward.To say that this product is not as good as a $100 slicer is probably true, and the blades can be dangerous, but anything designed to slice like this must be capable of damaging human fingers. Nonetheless, when I sliced an enormous pile of vegetables in minutes yesterday, I nearly danced for joy.I recommend practicing with this product when you're not in a hurry to get dinner on the table; if you train yourself, I think you'll really enjoy what you get for the price."
4,A great product at a terrific price,I researched this product and read ALL of the reviews. I wasskeptical at first but decided to buy it anyway. At [the price] you can't go wrong. As a professional chef I have tried numerous mandolines and this is by far the best. If you know anything about Hoffritz you know they produce some of the best blades in the industry. If you cut yourself on this product (as many apparently have) then you're doing something foolish or you're not paying attention. As soon as I'm finished here I'm ordering three more - that's how much I like them.
1,Nice product concept that won't work properly.,"The quality of the product seems excellent, I was favorably impressed when I opened the box. In theory, this is a great product except I can't get the first slicer insert back out of the slot, so unless I want everything sliced paper thin, I am out of options and cannot use any of the other three slicers that came with it. No tips or instructions were included."
5,"It's simple mechanics, folks","I bought this item about 2 years ago and use it mostly for slicing potatoes and making cole slaw. It is very easy to use, and despite what you may have read from others, it is easy to remove the blades as well. I understand the problem well. If you grasp the edge of the blade without really paying attention to how it is designed, the tendency is to pull down a bit. This puts pressure on the small piece of plastic that is designed to lock the blade in place, thus causing you to fight against the ""lock"". If you pull the blade slightly upward and out, it slides out very easily. For that matter, straight out works, too. It may not be fancy, but for my needs, it works great!"
1,Save your money!,"Great price but very poor performance. The adjustment plates were too close to the blade resulting in only one thickness of cut--very very thin. The tomato test failed with squished vegtable all over the place. Harder veggies do better, but again only one thickness--super thin. I've trashed the plastic parts and now have an expensive stainless steel bowl. Nothing in ad indicated that this was made in China."
4,Time saver,"I found this item to be quite useful. It greatly reduces the time to cut up hard vegetables for making soups and such. I've found the french fry and julienne blades to be a great way to short cut the dicing process.That said it is only truly effective with hard vegetables such as potatoes or onions. While I've been able to slice green peppers, the amount of finagling needed to slice up a large pepper makes cutting it by hand easier. Especially when trying to used the french fry or julienne blades."
4,Easier Blade Removal,"I read all of the reviews for this, good and bad. I really like the product. the biggest complaint I saw was that the blades are really hard to get out, if you lift up on the non-cutting end just a little bit, they slide right out. I wish the instructions had been a little more detailed, but I guess there really isn't much to say other than how to remove the blades. All in all I think this was a good product for a good price."
1,not good enough to be one star.....,"I read the other reviews, apparently no one tried to slice a tomato..... which is exactly why I bought it. I tried it with a nice firm tomato and got shredded tomato...... No, thank you!"
1,micro-slicer-juicer,"The steel bowl makes a good dog dish. This unit doesn't slice, it juices. The blades, there are really only two -- the other inserts are plastic, are too fine. Trying to slice jicama and potatoes, we got mush. This Hoffritz version is not a substitute for a high-quality mandoline. Don't let the bargain price fool you. This is a virtually useless appliance."
2,Not recommended for the elderly,"I bought this for my 82 year old mother in law - thinking it would be easier than peeling potatoes and vegetables the 'old fashioned way'. It isn't. If a person is losing the strength in their hands or wrists for ANY reason, this would not be the product to choose. Actually it isn't the product I thought it would be. It is well made, and has a nice stainless steel bowl (the only part she uses)."
1,Dangerous,I almost sliced my hand off the first time I used it. The blades are exposed and one of the slicer attachments came unattached when I tried to slice a bell pepper with it. I wish I had read the reviews first before I got it for Christmas...
2,not quite as good,Really nice bowl with cover. It mushed up the tomatoes and the safety handle you hold on to broke on the second use. It does however make very thin slices.
1,Slicer trouble,This is a nice system and it worked ok but could not get the blade out the first time. Everyone tried to remove it.Noone got it so I ended up throwing it out. What a waste of money!
2,Your dollars can be better spent somewhere else,"This cheap mandoline does french fries quite well, otherwise, too difficult to use. Maybe it is me, but one of the small handheld ones are much easier to deal with. The bowl is nice tho, you can do coleslaw (messy no matter HOW I make it!) and serve in the bowl."
1,Believe the bad reviews,"I am not going to extoll the virtues of a mandoline. I have a couple and they are very useful. However, the Hoffritz product is poorly constructed.The most important elements of a mandoline are a sharp blade and firm, even cutting surface. The cutting blade used for this item can not be removed for sharpening and it is made of flimsy, cheap steel that could not be sharpened even if it were accessible.In addition, you need a firm surface so that you get even cuts as you push food through the blade. Again, the Hoffritz fails here. The slicing surface ""bows"" easily, making for uneven slices.You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a good mandoline, but there are far better low cost options that this item."
1,Accident waiting to happen,deffinitely not recomended the bde inserts don't sit in the slot too securely so they will move on you. And just plain poor craftsmanship. I'm returning mine
3,Nice Bowl But!!!,"I bought this for my husband who doesn`t like dragging out the big food processor for his pizza toppings. Well after cutting my finger on the blade and trying to slice mushrooms & black olives (impossible), it is now in the back of the cupboard with the rest of the useless items......Will use the bowl and lid tho....."
2,"Hoffritz usually means quality, this is the exception","I love Hoffritz bakeware and their cutlery, thus I thought this would be an incredible bargain. I was sorely disappointed. I could not even get an onion to slice easily and remain pretty. I was going to send it back, but there's a $4.95 restocking fee, another fee based on it's weight, plus return shiping charges, so I'm keeping it. I own 20 pieces of their bakeware (and a few of kitchenaide, calphalon, and anolon) and they are equal or better than those top brands."
2,Yuck,"This gadget is clunky, hard to use, hard to clean and the instructions are horrible. I regret not spending more money and getting a better mandoline. The blades are really hard to load, and it is not intuitive to use. Save your money and buy something better! I really wish I had!"
5,What you see is what you get!,Product is actually larger than I thought. Neat and well designed function. I like the stainless bowl aspect of this mandolin. Easy to use and store. Well worth the money!
3,Awkward to use,"I used a cheap plastic mandoline for years. It finally broke on me and I replaced it with this. I used to use my first one all the time, but I actually avoid using this one. The top doesn't fit that snugly on the bowl and it flops up and down when you're slicing. Food seems to get jammed in the blades and there are only two slicing thicknesses - kind of thin and kind of thick. The food holder has these annoying metal pins that are supposed to move up as you slice, but I end up scraping metal to metal most of the time. There are two other blade types - julienne, which made a mess and french fry, which was pretty good.Overall, I'd have to say it was just okay - but certainly cheaper than my other options which frankly, look a little scary."
5,"This slicer rules! Beats ""hand"" slicing!","I cannot believe how much time this saves. It thinly sliced 3 potatoes in a couple of minutes which were all the same thickness and the clean up is a breeze. I used the potato slices to make ""bake chips"" (either microwaved or placed in oven.) So much better than slicing by hand, I got so tired of doing that and were never the same size. The blades have a little holder and I personally didn't think they are hard to swith out. Like all the reviews have said, just slightly lift as you slide it out. AWESOME stainless steel bowl with lid. I can imagine all the possibilities....hash browns, cole slaw, french fries. I highly recommend this. Slice stuff in advance and store it in the bowl. It's at a great price right now with free shipping."
1,Very disappointing,"The one star is for the fancy stainless steel bowl with lid. This mandoline is rubbish, (I must admit I do not know how other mandolins compare though). But this item is so fiddley to use, it pulverises tomatos, liquidises onions, makes weird shaped carrots...and it is very diffucult to remove the blade. Infact it is dangerous, I stuck on my oven glove to save my fingers! Save your money for a good knife and save yourself the frustration. Very disappointing."
1,Junk!,"This thing can not slice a potato. The blade is not sharp enough. When you try to push a potato thru you have to use so much force that the blade housing will pop off the bowl, and the potato will get stuck. The safety handle does not grip the food well enough to stay on either."
1,Hated it,"I found it impractical, cut myself several times, hard to store, when changing the blades they often stuck (leading to cuts). When I moved I didn't take it with me."
2,Get what you pay for,"That applies here. Product was pretty flimsy except for the bowl and the guides and blades didn't work very well. These type of slicers can be very useful, but I would spend a little more and get a better one."
1,COMPLETELY WORTHLESS!,"I first tried inserting the french fry cutting plate - and put a fairly small Russet potato onto the prongs. The top holder with prongs is so flimsy that I couldn't even move the potato over the blade! Then I tried to remove the french fry plate to try another vegetable, and it was stuck so hard in the frame I couldn't remove it.I checked Amazon orders to see if I got this here... and found I purchased it in 2001! I love that Amazon keeps track of my purchases for that long. But this was one of those things that got put in a drawer when received and not opened for years, so I'll just toss for recycle if possible."
5,This works great,"We have owned one of these mandolines for a couple of years. And people have asked us about it. So, now, we give them as gifts. Easy to use, easy to clean. Go ahead, buy one for your self."
3,Got a sander?,"This piece of equpment works very well, I am very satisfied with it in general ( My husband thought it was a disaster waiting to happen). How ever if you don't have a belt sander don't buy this, the blades once in are impossible (really) to get out. My husband and I got it out using vice grips in a tug of war manner (911 on standby). Once we did that we sanded down all the blades to fit. This is a great kitchen help that needs to go back to to formula to refit blades."
5,Pickle-mania,"I ordered 5 of these last year, one for myself and the others for gifts. I make a lot of pickles in the summer and this thing is the best! Also superior for making frys, coleslaw, french onion soup. Easy to use and easy to clean, but make sure you follow the safety instructions, I have cut myself a few times!"
4,SLICING MADE EASY,"Never, never again will I slice vegetables or fruit by hand. This nifty gadget slices and shreds uniformly and quickly.For us, attractiveness in serving is important, and now my dishes, especially potatoes, look as if they had been prepared by a professional chef."
3,Slices well but dangerous,"Works well, but difficult to remove the very sharp inserts. Keep a wide blade screwdriver available to remove inserts. (I wouldn't kids near this thing)"
1,EXTREMELY elementary,"I am an Executive Assistant in a corporation and I am working on redoing the file management system for my department. I was hoping that this book would give me some good, new ideas for streamlining our system. What I found when I opened it, was information that seemed more suited for a remedial high school business course.So, if you are in search of a book that will teach you how to alphabetize and similarly elementary concepts, this would be a great resource. Otherwise, skip it and find something more suitable for business professionals."
1,"Buyer Beware!! Repackaged version of ""Heroes of World Class""","For those of you who purchased the independently-released ""Heroes of World Class"" DVD a few years ago, don't bother picking this up as it is the exact same thing (albeit with different packaging)!! Nothing new to see here, folks!With the WWE owning the World Class Championship Wrestling tape library, it should have come as no suprise that this was nothing more than arehash of a disc that has already been released twice before.For shame!Let my blunder be a lesson to the discerning buyer.Oh, well. Time to test out Amazon's return policy..."
3,Ancient romance,This book is very interesting and beautiful. General readers or those like me with a basic knowledge of linguistics may find it a little too specialised-- a knowledge of phonetics is essential. Perhaps too much notation for the general reader--but absolutely fascinating and a great addition to my library.
2,Nothing new here.,"Maybe this was cutting edge in the early 1990s, but today many of the chapters come off as dry, and devoid of creative or incisive thinking on the future of the field. Plenty of grandstanding and self glorification (see the Wood and Skole chaper in particular)."
2,I bought this unit.,"First, it's analog. That's important to understand. So if you have anything else in the house running on 900 MHz -- like a cordless phone -- you'll get heavy hissing. You'll have to do a lot of fiddling. If you want to use the headphones only on line of sight -- in front of your TV -- get yourself a cheaper infra-red system. Works much better."
3,buy the original please,"david berger's entire career is almost completely based on transcribing other musician's genuis - most notably Duke Ellington. to any of those who think that these are new ""jazzy"" arrangements of the nutcracker you should be interested in picking up the original, scored and arranged by Ellington and Strayhorn on a CD entitled ""Three Suites"". dont get me wrong - his band is good and he has some very accomplished musicians - but c'mon now - you really need to go with the Duke on this one."
4,A WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this small tour of geographic and literary London. Having spent time there on several occasions the venues were all familiar and allowed me to relive some pleasant times.Quindlen is always readable; on any subject. On London, which she obviously loves, one feels a special connection. But, if I had not visited there, myself, I am not sure that reading it would have been so pleasurable."
1,Never received my book.,I never received this book. I sent an email to the sender and they never responded. I would like to know where my money went.
1,Save your money,"There is so much more to the imaginary London than the author conveys. This book feels like it was dictated to complete an assignment. Buy the Ackroyd book, London: A Biography instead...and then use your own imagination. I agree with previous reviewers who called it superficial with the real book still waiting for an author to write it."
2,not as good as it coulda shoulda been,"i love anna quindlen, i love literature, i love landscapes of the imagination, and i love london, so i was ready to love this book. however, it didn't give me nearly the depth i wanted. the essays are oddly generic, the comments oddly superficial. i was left with little impression, literary or geographical. i'm sad."
2,Disappointing product,"I am very disappointed with this product. I purchased this oil set because they looked really nice and the Editorial review said that it worked as a mister. When I received the product I immediately tried it out. The first few ""sprays"" the oil just squirted out in a steady stream, and after a few tries it would spray out with large droplets, not a fine mist. Not at all what I had expected. It works well to add a little bit of oil to a pan, but that's what I have a squeeze bottle for. If you are looking for something pretty to use while oiling your pans while cooking, this product will work for you. But if you are looking for something to grease your cake pans or lightly coat food with oil, this product will not work well. I will be returning mine and trying the Misto one intead."
2,Very attractive set but not functional,I received this set as a Christmas gift and it is very attractive and goes well in my stanless kitchen. It sprays vinegar in a mist but oil comes out in a stream instead of a mist. Does not compare to the Misto Mister. I would not buy.Hoffritz Stainless-Steel Gourmet Oil Set
1,Not the full length it claims as soon as you wash it,"Arrives in a length that is acceptable, but as soon as you wash it, it is now a mid calf or close to that.You can purchase the length it shrinks to be anywhere with out going thru ordering online and paying for something it is not."
4,Comprahenzive Lexicon in Norwegian,The lexicon is one of the most comprahenzive versions of lexicon in Norwegian ever made.
3,Motivating and inspiring,"Unstoppable is truly a marvelous read!! I picked up the book while on vacation and found I could not put it down.The stories are inspiring; it shows how anyone can achieve success if they choose too. Each of the 7 Characteristics have supporting stories, plus the personal action plans to help ones focus. And the quotes at the end of every story by the person who was the subject of the story are very up lifting.This is a book I have and will continue to recommend. It can help you focus, be inspired and renew your spirit. You will realize you can achieve if you believe in yourself!!"
5,Breakthru Accomplished,"Love this book, if you stick to it you will accomplish your goal. I transitioned from my corporate job to my dream job by sticking to my goals, staying focused & doing the steps within 30days. I bought this book for my girlfriend & I. We are working on new goals. My life changed when I finally put my life skills & passion to work. This book got me started 2.5 years ago and I will never forget it."
2,A bland yaoi title,"I'm not too familiar with this author or the company putting out these books. But I decided to give it a chance, being a yaoi fan. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The art is mediocre, and the storyline was very weak-I actually felt like I was reading bad fanfiction the whole time. I don't like to write off an author completely though, so perhaps her other titles will be stronger."
4,The story was really good.,"I'll admit I wasn't fond of the artwork for the main title, but after I read the first page, I was hooked. The characters are well developed and plot's interesting. However, towards the end it seemed to wrap up a little fast. (I think I'd have preferred a longer story, to be quite honest.) In all, it's a very good read and a sweet love story to boot."
2,Another poor production from Yaoi Press!,"Kingdom of Selfish Love again proves my point that Yaoi Press production simply lags behind Japanese Yaoi/Shounen-ai manga.Yaoi Press graphics is amateurish, childish and crude and their plots lack depth. Kingdom of Selfish Love is no exception. Over US$10 per book, this is simply not worth it. Still I rate it 2 stars because there is a story line though nothing to shout about! No more purchase from Yaoi Press for me!"
5,Great retelling,"I really enjoyed this book. I bought it to read to my four-year-old and the book well exceeded my expectations.Here you will find classics such as the Three Billy Goats Gruff and tales you may never have heard of. They are all beautifully put together and could be told as a traditional story teller might or read aloud for maximum impact.Great stories well told, and a treasure trove for children and folklorists alike."
2,Boooorrrrring,"I was given this book as a gift, and let me say that I am glad it was a gift and not something I purchased on my own. It is terribly slow and hard to get into. If you are having trouble sleeping at night, then this is the perfect book for you because it is better than any sleeping pill could ever be for putting someone to sleep."
1,Aliens left America...Please!,"This book is not a good read. I thought I had alot of energy but after reading ""aliens over america"", I felt lazy."
5,GREAT CASE FROM BUDS,"Arrived in perfect condition & in quick time. Was exactly as advertised, well worth the money."
4,It seems to fulfill its purpose,"I've taken 1 capsule on several nights and seems to help me rest better, especially after having coffee too late in the day."
2,Dislike it,"Didn't work for me. But if you take it with Theanine, it adds a litlle sensation of relaxation to L Theanine. But just the Gaba by itself doesn't result. At least in my case."
1,Wrong stuff,Product sent was not what was ordered. I ordered Pureology Gel and got Pureology Serum for colored hair. My hair is uncolored.
5,No more bitter coffee or tea,"I've used this press for years for coffee and tea. The best thing is, you brew your drink to the desired strength and the grounds/leaves are pulled to the top so the steeping process stops. This means all your cups are the same instead of weak at the start and too strong and bitter by the last cup."
3,I need the Cliff Notes. . .the Monarch Notes. . .on this one,"Although it puzzles, it affects.I'm not sure I understand but I sense the loss (thoughtime. . .is. . .disjointed), the madness (Is there any connection between different stories here? Or, just the watch?), the loneliness of everyone (allthetime. . .all. . .the disjointedtime). But, despite my inability to understand, I will remember: the floating suitcase, the traffic reflected by the skyscrappers, the woman's pained face, the man fronting the Ferris wheel. . ."
2,Homage to Truffaut lost on this viewer,"I'm as open as the next person to expanding my cinematic horizons. Case in point: the Korean film '301/302' - distasteful to many, I stomached my way through it (apologies for those bad puns to anyone who has seen that film).""What Time Is It There?"" is a different story. I tried - really tried - to force my way through a complete viewing. Just impossible. I lasted 65 or so seemingly interminable minutes. I see here on these pages that Ming-liang Tsai has crafted an homage to Truffaut's ""400 Blows."" Honestly, when I'm forced to watch a guy urinate into a bag for two whole minutes (no exaggeration), the last thing I'm thinking about is the subtlety of some guy's homage.I'll bump this up to two stars because given the other reviews posted here, I can see that a true student of film can discern these elements of Truffaut. I respect that. I just think that this movie is (very emphatically) not going to be everyone's cup of tea."
3,Works rather better in the memory than on the screen,"What Time is it There? is one of those films that works better on paper or in the memory than while you're actually watching it - there's only so much non-communication shot in static camera setups you can take before boredom sets in, and two hours of it gets to be pretty heavy going at times. It's full of quirky and enjoyable touches, and one outstanding scene where the lead character's mother unloads her loss on a pet fish, but it does seem overly compelled to try your patience at times: after all, how many scenes of a guy urinating into bottles or plastic bags do you really need in one movie? Still, there is a great cameo from Jean Pierre Leaud."
1,"Apart from the ending, this would have been 5 stars","What a disappointment. This definitely was one of the best horror novels I have read for a long time, it was scary, interesting, an excellent plot, a great character development, simply unputdownable. I loved to read it and every evening I was looking forward to continuing to read it, wondering how he would get out of this one and make things sane again. -- and then this abysmal ending. What a disappointment, what a letdown. It is as if Ben Hur had lost the chariot race, went home for a good cry and decided to take over his fathers office, you just dont expect such a disappointing ending after such a brilliant start. Sorry about this. (and the single star is only handed out because I know that Masterton is a brilliant writer. Any other writer would have gotten two or three stars, but somebody with such a vivid imagination -- too bad)"
3,Sandisk Leather Protective Case,So much stuff for the big name mp3 product - I was glad to find an item that would protect my Sandisk mp3 player. Turns out that the case is very tight and covers some of the function buttons so that you can't see or work them very well. The leather is too tough to make adjustments but it DOES protect the product. Just wish that it fit better for the purpose that it was designed for.
4,Looks nice but...,"I like the look and feel of this case. I bought the red model and it is a beautiful shade of red. Two things bother me about this item though; If this is a Sandisk product, especially designed to fit my Sansa E100 series mp3 player, then why didn't the designers make it to fit right? And why didn't Sandisk reject this product?I can't believe that the whole front panel is about 1/4 inch off from where it should be. The screen does not show in full, and the buttons neither. If you look at the picture provided by Amazon, that is exactly what you will get. Sometimes I wonder how these companies can manufacture iems with such vital defects and put them on sale as if they were good.I bought this because I found no other alternative product on the market, other than that eeky silicone thing.Also, I find the belt clip a bit too clunky.All this being said, it is nicely built and it makes my Sansa E140 look very stylish.I will keep it with all it's faults."
3,Christian Metal from back in the day,"This CD is pretty good. ""Oscillating Fullwave Bridge Rectifiers"" is such a bad song I had to deduct 2 stars for even wasting the space on the disc - and insulting our intelligence by including it on the recording. I like the message and most of the songs - but it is out of print now so pick up a used one like I did."
4,informative,"I've been an avid bourbon drinker for about 10 years but I learned a lot from this book. This book covers the history of bourbon, the whiskey making process, how to taste bourbon, whiskey reviews, and information on individual distillers. If you're a bourbon drinker you owe it to yourself to read this book."
3,"Informative, but not pretty","The content of book is very good - well written, interesting and about what I was hoping for. However, the print quality of the book itself is sub-par. The type is tiny, and the quality of the images is grainy at best. I was hoping for something that would be as visually stimulating as it was informative. This wasn't it."
2,Poor ironing and heat.,"I recently purchased this iron. Despite claiming to be a 1200 W iron, it was quite poor in ironing my cotton shirts. The iron was simply not hot enough to do the job quickly. I will be returning this iron soon."
2,Mine leaks,"For whatever reason, my iron leaks water when I am steaming. I am using distilled water, because the tap water ruined my old iron. Does Black and Decker have any product recalls on this one?"
3,"Gets hot quickly, but leaks a lot","We have been using this for a few years, and it generally works well. The only complaint is that it sometimes leaks a lot of water all over the place. The best part is that it gets hot very quickly so you aren't waiting around to start ironing."
4,I liked the movie but...................................,"Did the writers of the movie actually read the book? The story line was so far from the book. I would have enjoyed the movie more had I not read the book first. The movie was worth watching and buying, however I liked the book's version of the story much better. Brenda Jackson told a much better story."
1,Not worth it!,"This stereo worked well for two days, then the cd changer kept jamming...I have taken it in three times to get repaired. After they replaced all of the loading tray parts it still only worked for one day! Now I have two cd's jammed in there and I am working with Pioneer on getting a refund. Trust me, this system is not worth the frustration!"
1,They simply do not work,"I bought these for several cars and encouraged friends to get them before I had experience with them. (Foolish.)They simply do not work. You can get your pressure far below their set pressure and they will continue to show no problem.Totally unreliable. Plus, since you are driving around with your valve stem pin pushed in, if these things develop a leak themselves, you lose tire pressure.I think they are dangerous."
1,Waste of money,Sorry to say that these caps do not work! I had thought by seeing green the tires were fine when all the time they were losing air! To back my claim an ASC certified mechanic said that these caps were a waste of money. They simply give you a false sense of confidence.
2,Be careful,"I think this product is a great idea. It's an inexpensive and quick visual method to see if your tires are getting low on pressure.I rated these two stars because the quality is not good.I had a slow leak that went on for several weeks in one tire. I kept checking the tire and checking it again to see how it was that it was low on air. I was about to take a trip to the tire store to have them remove the tire and test it when I got the idea to remove my (fairly) new tire pressure cap monitor to see if that was the problem. Sure enough, the device had separated between the metal stem and the plastic top (where the color coded top is) and it had been slowly leaking for several weeks.For this reason I would pass on recommending these devices."
1,Awful,This is possibly the worst film I have ever seen....just dont even bother wasting your life on this garbage!
1,do not watch this film!!!!!!!!!,"This is THE worst film that i have ever seen (and i have seen blairwitch 2!) it has got to be the worst film ever made. i have even taken the time out of my life to warn you appreciators of good films not to burden yourselves with the shame of watching it, the acting is incredibly bad as is the camerawork (what was the director thinking?). this film is so bad it does not even warrant the 1 star which i gave it. PLEASE do not even think about seeing this flik 4 the sake of film buffs everywhere infact if you see it in a shop just burn it. simple as that!"
1,Bad Corn,"Dark Harvest is an amazingly inept way to take an interesting idea and completely defile it. Wisely shying away from the old run-of-the-mill slasher formula, the film adds a supernatural touch while attempting to build a mood where you anticipate how the story will play out. It's an unfortunate thing that... nothing at all happens. As the film loses any type of momentum, the plot diminshes to scarecrows in bad makeup chasing scantly clad young adults with sharp objects. At this point, I expect the acting in these grade Z horror films to be bad, put I expect that the cast look like they're trying to emote... something. The actor's in Dark Harvest look like they barely care that they're being chased and killed. To call this film corny would be too kind, to call it disasterous would be quite a bit more accurate."
1,Not even worth a rental,"Funny how the only people giving this movie decent ratings are from Virginia (where the film company is located) or West Virginia (where the film is set); you think they're insiders trying to boost the rating? Any self-respecting UNBIASED viewer can tell that this movie is junk within the first 3 minutes. The only things that made me watch it were the cover art, the fact that it was distributed by Lions Gate (I mistakingly thought this assured a level of quality, but it's actually made by a smaller company from Richmond, VA), and the fact that it seemed to be filmed on film, not video. Of course, none of this helps the horrible high school play acting, the terrible dialogue, the cheesy FX/make-up, and the utter lack of suspense or fright."
1,El-Stinko Productions presents...Dark Harvest,"I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this film simply because it doesn't deserve it one way or the other. But if you like poor acting, poor filming and poor dialogue, then this movie is for you. If not, I recommend that you skip it!"
1,wow this was bad,"So a bunch of my friends and I rented this movie over the summer because a co-worker was actually in it. The movie was absolutely horrible. The acting, directing, and special effects were terrible. The script is one big cliche. But, I do have to say, Dark Harvest makes a pretty good drinking game and it was well worth renting to see our coworker get offed."
1,same folks that brought you Blair Witch,"I figured you couldn't go wrong since the box art looked professional and Artisan releases some entertaining movies. This is about as bad as it gets, folks!! D grade acting with a solid F for writing and special effects. No thrills to be found here other than from the additional trailers on the disc."
2,DVD box makes a great pillow for when you fall asleep watching it.,"Dark Harvest (Paul Moore, 2004)Ho hum. Another group of young-and-beautifuls, another secluded house, another evil supernatural entity. Well, at least the young-and-beautifuls are young and, well, beautiful. Still, there's not a shred of originality to be found here. More likely to inspire yawns than screams, except in those places where the Y-and-Bs go swimming (sans bathing suits, naturally). At least that stirs some, erm, emotion. *"
1,Umm.......,"This movie is entertaining, but it is so bad. In some parts the sound Wasnt going with the peoples mouth. The Camera work is sooooo bad.In At Least 5 shots (5 seconds) where there is no one in the picture. And the skinny dipping?..........!Acting: DScript: CProduction: FActors: C"
5,Great player,"Just bought one of these from Amazon. Have had no problems whatsoever. Plays double sided disks, does not get warm, no reflection from silver casing. Battery lasted me easily through the in-flight portion of a cross country plane trip with a stopover. If you want perfect sound and a perfect picture, get a home theatre, not a portable DVD player. It's true the controls are not that intuitive, but that's what the manual is for. There was one movie I couldn't hear that well on the plane with the noise-cancelling headset on, but I could hear the other, so you may want to bring a variety when you travel. A major life-saver for frequent travelers. If you can afford it, buy it."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews and doing my own research on the LV75, I thought i was in for a good buy considering the price.All went well the first two weeks until the player started hanging and failing to read disks.I had only watched around six DVD's and had not even charged the battery once since i was running it through the mains.It would literaly say reading and would not pick up the disk for up to half an hour when i eventualy tried to turn it off and it would not even do that, it just hung. I thought perhaps it would just be a once off failure but then it started happening regularly, so i took it back to Panasonic and am currently waiting for a decision regarding an exchange.I must say for the first six DVD's I was able to watch, it was brilliant!!, Maybe i just bought a Dud, lets see if Panasonic comes through or not!!"
4,6.2 or 7?,"Just to clear up the confusion about the screen that someone wrote about saying it was 6.2 inches,it really is 6.2 inches ACROSS, but it is exactly 7 inches DIAGONALY. (NO OFFENSE TO WHO EVER WROTE THAT)"
5,Every Christian should read this book,"This book is life changing. It has so much to say on the depth of who God is, and what our reaction should be in knowing this truth. Wonderful book. A must read."
5,Can It Get Any Better?,One of the best books on faith ever written now has a study guide. Very few books outside the Bible have had the impact that this book has had on a great many leaders. Highly recommend this book and if you're interested in reading it with a friend...then get this study guide.
4,Pursuit of God Study Guide,"Tozer's The Pursuit of God is a deep, deep writing. Each reading reveals more of God and His purpose in our lives. The study guide, while faithfully following the format of the text, falls short of plumbing the depths of the text. It is a good starting point, but needs to be supplemented with teaching and discussion led by one who can reach into the depths the study guide leaves unexplored."
5,Pursuit of God is the best,This book provides a gateway to know and come closer to God. I have used this book to teach a class at my church and 18 of us have drawn much closer to God in the process. All of us note an improved prayer life and better focus on God.
3,sample packets,"these are really just samples packets that once you tear open, you can't close and save the contents. Usually companies give this type of thing for free. I thought these would at least be small quantities in little vials or packages you could open and close and use for travel.... I'm not sure these are worth $20+. The jury is still out on the actual products...."
3,more kinky than erotic...,"I have enjoyed many Black Lace books, and the first short story collection, but this collection of stories was primarily dealing with bondage and kinky stuff. Very little of it was romantic, and most of it was not even very erotic. I would recommend their earlier short story collections and novels, if you prefer more romantic erotica. My favorite novel from Black Lace Books, was The Captivation by Natasha Rostova; my favorite Black Lace short story collection was Sugar and Spice."
5,Beatiful Paris Poster:)!,"I purchased this poster because i needed one to hang above my bed. I love anything that has to do with Paris France, and when I saw this I fell in love with it!! I'm planning to buy a poster frame for it so it will look even better! Delivery, and packaging was awesome!! Would definatley buy again!:)"
4,could have been better,"Poster was received with a tear and crinkles. Would have sent it back, but the frame covered the hole and the glass presses the crinkles so you can't tell.Good deal, good quality, but shipping (I assume), was very sub-par. Will consider using seller again."
5,Lovely Paris poster,I really love this poster. It looks very good in my room and the quality of the poster itself is great. I'm really happy that I bought it and that it wasn't some rip off. It's really really nice.
5,Love it!,"I love the poster, it's a good size and quality! I actually have it hanging over my bed! It's actually very pretty and you will love it too!"
1,bad experience with Location Free -,"i am a big fan of SONY i like lots fo their products but in this particular case i think they failed in design, and also the product i bought wasnt working properly but the set up was painful and having to buy an aditional software to make i work on my Mac really hurts cause now that I finally returned this product i am stock with the software so if somebody want this for a mac call me i will kindly give you the software, not meaning this will work fine and smooth"
2,Slingbox is better,"I own both the Sony LocationFree and the Slingbox. The Sony I bought in Japan and the Slingbox in the US. The Slingbox is better for these reasons:1) The Slingbox is easier to configure.2) With the Slingbox, same PC can simultaneously run both over the Internet on your LAN. This saves reconfiguration when you use your laptop both in and out of the house.3) Sony charges for each additional client software license while the Slingbox is free for download. While neither will allow multiple devices to simultaeously stream video, multiple seperate devices can be registered to run per Slingbox where only one device can be registered to run per LocationFree. In the latter case, you must ""de-register"" your PC before allowing another to connect using the same license.4) The Slingbox has comprehensive remote control capability even when your away from home where the LocationFree does not."
3,Never Made it out of the box,I will keep this short. What sony forgot to tell me was that the only setup process is for pc. I was looking forward to using this with my psp but the fact is that without a pc you will never be able to use this and if you want to watch tv on your mac you will have to buy seperate software. This is no problem for some but for me its useless.
4,"Shipment and item good, note is too brief","Although the shipment is good and item is intact, the product explaination note is too easy or brief to follow, to me at least.Maybe Japanese is not good on technical writing to let layman to understand by only one page note."
5,Brilliant!,"First, musically this album is wonderful. Christmas music?? Sure, on a couple of the tracks, but the majority of the album is 'anytime' music.Second, it is beautifully recorded and mastered for this CD. Ella is in her prime and the orchestrations / arrangements are brilliant.The best xMas CD I own! First rate."
4,Religious Ella,"This is for the person asking about Ella's religious recordings.There is another album/cd called Ella Fitzgeralds Christmas, which is the total opposite of her swinging Christmas. The songs are sung straight with a very strong choral background. It is quite a bueatiful recording. There is also an album titled 'Brighten The Corner' which was originally released by Capitol. This finds Ella singing religious/slow gospel songs, such as 'A closer walk with thee'and'The old rugged cross' among others. I believe that some of these tracks are on a greatest hits compilation issued by Capitol. This album also has a selection of country and western tunes such as 'Misty Blue' and 'Turn the world the other way' Hope this was useful to you.PS does anyone have copies of Ella In Hollywood or Ella In Hamburg-they are impossible to get in Australia"
4,other tracks,"i'm curious to know the titles of the additional tracks.i have the original but am looking for any additional christmas ella - including her ""religious stuff.""anyone?"
2,Not a good sandal,The sole of this sandal provides a lot of cushioning and supports. They fit true to the size. However the inside material (mesh) of the upper part is too rough for my bare feet. I can't walk a long distance without scraping my feet.
3,o.k.,"Yeah, it was alright. Unauthorized documentary so there was no music by the band, which [was bad]. Other than that, it was pretty interesting. Hey baby, nice aesthetics!"
4,Excellent but out of date,This is a very good reference book but unfortunately PET books are out of date quickly and this book's publication date in 2003 means it mostly misses out on PET/CT. It is still a worthwhile book though but combine with newer books covering PET/CT like PET and PET/CT (Lin and Alavi) and Atlas of PET/CT (Phelps et al).
1,Product Description is Incorrect,"Amazon's product description indicates that this switch will work with Macs, but it doesn't. Even the user manual says that it only works with PCs. So who gets the lone star -- Cables to Go, or Amazon?"
1,"please,do not bother","Very disappointing.Meager selection of his songs,He deserves a lot better.Worst of all,oh my god!Those arrangements!Very bad."
1,A frail Can Crusher,Northern Industrial Tools Automatic Feed Can CrusherThis product is poorly designed and therefore it continualy jams until it breaks. There are far better can crushers on the market. Save your money.
1,"Review of 10 can, can crusher - both a summary and in-depth","Hello All - Well for those of you who don't like to read much, I will save you a LOT of time. This item is a literal P.O.S. That is Piece of ""*&$#""....Now for those who want to read and know more, I will go into detail. The unit is a ""great"" idea. But, the problem is this: 1.) The design is far from perfect, I was expecting a LOT more for my $25.00 2.) The cans do not easily stack in the shoot and you spend quite a bit of time manipulating them to lie flat. 3.) The ejection shoot is too large and about 20% of the time a can will blow out the bottom without being crushed properly and then upset the stack above. 4.) If the company would have just spent $2.00 more on materials and a bit more engineering, this could have been a great product. 5.) My guess is that it will break long before I ever get my monies worth out of it.In two words I will tell you to : STAY AWAY"
3,10 Can Crusher Review,"Product is a bit flimsy, made out of all plastics.Bin holder does a poor job of holding cans in place duringthe actual crushing action.Overall it does the job with some added assistance.Satisfaction 1-10 = 7"
1,Almost good,"This was my second crusher. The first I got at Northern tool for six dollars, and it lasted 3 days before it fell apart. I returned the cheap one and bought this one.It lasted for a week before the lever arm, which is plastic, began to deform.Before long it was distorted to the point that it did not function any more.There may be a decent product out there, but this isn't it."
2,"Not strong, could crush better","The pressure point for this crusher is a plastic piece that broke after about 100 crushes. The company that makes it doesnt have a website that sells replacement parts. I rebuilt the unit, using a steel hinge. The plunger that crushes the cans could crush better if it was another inch in depth. Try a differnt brand."
5,Nice Product,It works very well. Installed in miinutes.I have owned this for a month and crushed 30 lbs of cans without an issue.
3,"It works, but is it worth the cost?","It was easy to setup and it crushes well. I also like the space on the bottom where it falls out when it is crushed and I put a box under it to catch it. There are other can crushers out there which can crush one at a time which I have used before. This is more quick and more acurate in crushing it down and not popping out and easy to drop into a box. My only problem is that when you order it, the prices is right, just the shipping can increase the cost 50% or more depending on the place you are ordering from. If you can get a shipping cost of $5.00 or less, then I think it is a good deal. I just did not like ths shipping costs being so much. If it was at a local store, I would buy it without thinking twice because the tax would be much less than shipping."
5,It Squishes Great,"It squishes cans quite well. We used to have one of those smaller all metal units, but the handle broke nearly immediately, and had to be taped up to function. This one is a big improvement, as well as having to be used less often due to capacity. The only (slight) drawback is that the can Holder could be a little beefier. But we figure the weight difference in Plastic vs Metal was a lot of the consideration. It has not failed after hundreds of uses, so it is becoming a moot point.Overall, it is a fantastic tool, and we recommend it highly."
3,A fair can crusher,"There is nothing wrong with the aluminum can crusher, the problem is the basket that is to hold the cans. The basket is very hard to assemble. The plastic is very brittle and hard to insert the assembly tabs into the corresponding holes."
2,Buy A Sturdier Can Crusher,"Very frail. When loaded with 10 cans, they often flip and jam and pop out of the crusher. Plus it only crushes 12oz cans. I ended up loading each can one at a time and then crushing them. A nice idea, but I'm scrapping this one and buying another can crusher."
3,Plastic sides rails broke.,The crusher works good except the plastic side rails broke after a few weeks. Would be nice if the whole unit was made of metal.....but then it might last too long???
2,CAN CRUSHER,"Product does it's job, but is somewhat chintzy and doesn't crush the cans all the way. Also, shipping was a little high."
1,Save your $$$$,"I was just engaged, really excited to start planning and get organized. I researched books for hours online and decided on this one. In reality none of the wedding planners and organizers are worth it. Get a 3"" ring binder, tabs and sheet protectors from Office Depot. If you are really feeling like you need guidance, go pick up Wedding Planning for dummies (seriously). And get on the knot.com to stay organized with free tips. ---- Plus not to mention my NEW book was not new at all. It had writing in it in various parts of the book."
2,Not worth it,"I was excited to start planning my wedding and thought that this binder would be so helpful. While it may give good information, there is better information in ""Bridal Bargains"" a book that doesn't have a binder or folders or anythign inside it. It's better to buy the Bridal Bargains book from a couple who know their stuff and just get a notebook to keep yourself oganized."
1,cheap,I bought this book and the calculator doesnt work. So I just bought it and have to return it. Not sure if I will exchange it for the same book! After looking inside it doesnt seem like the pockets will hold much stuff. I need something that will hold lots of ideas!!
4,A great book but...,This was a gift and it arrived on the day I was to give it. Very good book but the hard cover was bent so I was disappointed in the appearance.
2,Good packaging but substandard content,"I bounght and then returned this book, primarily because although the format (binder etc.) was excellent the content left much to be desired.The information contained was relatively sparse, and several pages would have had to be xeroxed - for example the 'Guest List' was only one page with space for maybe 16 names.Instead I bought the 'Easy Wedding Planner, Organizer & Keepsake' (same authors), removed the pages from the spiral binding and put them in my own ringbound folder, so I could punch and add my own paperwork. I would recommend doing the same; even though it takes some time, it's worth it!"
3,"Useful, As-Expected","It's nothing extra special, but it gets the job done. Honestly, you could make your own with a big binder, pocket folders, tab dividers, free information from wedding planning websites, spreadsheets you make on your own, etc. -- but I'm pretty busy, so it's nice to have it done for me. All-in-all, I'd buy it again, and I'm definitely using it quite a bit."
4,Great Help,"This book is great because it is tabbed for easy reference. It was a great price too. It can be carried with you anywhere. And I love that it spaces to write everything from the propasol to your wedding vows. It includes tips to save money also, without sounding like you're trying to be cheap. It has all the directions for addressing envelopes and reasons behind some old traditions. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it sounds like it's almost trying to help you plan a very upscale, classy, expensive, almost unrealistic wedding at times. But otherwise it is great. I definately recommend it."
4,wonderful book to keep you on track and not forget anything.,Wonderful book to keep you on track and not forget anything. My daughter love this book and I had to get it for my niece.
5,Really Helpful,I used this book for my wedding 5 years ago and it kept me organized! I liked it so much that I bought it for a cousin who is getting married.
4,THE ULTIMATE WEDDING PLANNER & ORGANIZER,"LOVED THE BOOK, LIKE NEW... BUT I AM HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE CALCULATOR..."
3,It's ok,This product was not really what I expected it to be. I guess I should have just made my own book. I have used it a little but but just for the folders
2,Waste of money!,"After purchasing and reviewing this book I was sadly disappointed. I could have made the whole thing tabs, page protectors and binder from an office store for half the price. The information in the book can be found in other bridal books and most of them are much more thorough. Don't waste your time or money on this."
1,Don't bother!,"This book is too big to be useful or take anywhere, it doesn't provide any useful information, and the folders in it for holding pictures or magazine clippings are too small for holding a normal sheet of paper and also too loose to hold anything smaller (they fall right out). I suggest that if you want a binder, buy an empty one to fill yourself, that's what I ended up doing!"
4,A very nice read!,Buddha's Little Instruction BookI find this book an easy read! Good instructions! And mindful meditations.
5,daily wisdom,This is a great little book when you want just a few lines to think about during meditation or throughout the day. Easy to understand and apply in today's world.
4,A neat little book of various short verses of wisdom for those who enjoy peaceful thoughts.,"This book is not the best text on the market when it comes to quotes from the Budha and other historical famous masters; however, it is compact and easy to read. The first 124 pages have a single verse along with a drawing on each of the pages. The only real instruction in this volume is the last section which includes six short meditations designed to help ""quiet your mind and open your heart in the midst of everyday life."" They include a sitting meditation, a walking meditation, an eating meditation, a loving kindness meditation, a forgivness meditation and a compassion meditation.In conclusion this is a book for anyone who enjoys reading short verses of wisdom for inspiration and peace of mind.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Season of the Warrior: A poetic tribute to warriors)"
1,False Advertising,"The book was sold as NEW. I got a message that the book had some writing in it, but the seller would white that out and not charge me shipping. If the book isn't NEW, don't say it is. Very frustrated, as I was buying this as a gift, and had to scramble at the last minute"
2,Average (and only just that),"This has obviously been transferred from video with no thought of 'cleaning' the picture quality, so it can get very dark and/or scratchy.The two 'shows' are precisely what they say. Girls taking showers. It gets rather boring after a very short time."
2,Stylish but Lacking in Functionality,"I got this thing out of the box and was really impressed with it's looks but the fun stopped there. While I was checking my nice little chrome shaker out I tilted it to the side and the top proceeded to fall off. Worried, I put some ice and a bit of simulated gin (H20) inside, gave it a few shakes and it leaked everywhere. Good thing this wasnt real gin! I dont know if this is just mine but I wasnt impressed with the the functionality. Going with Oneida."
1,DANGEROUS ITEM!,Babies should not have any blankets in their crib and certainly not a down comforter. It is a well known fact that they can suffocate with items like this. SIDS! Do not buy this irresponsible item!
1,THE WORST QUALITY EVER,"this was just waste of money buying this comforter , such a bad quality , after just 3 weeks became thinner and thinner, and now i have thin side and the other one regular.... DO NOT BUY THIS COMFORTER , YOU WILL REGRET AFTER A WHILE. I jave this one only foe 3 month and alredy thinking to buy new one ...."
4,Reverse Coffee Press makes Fabulous Coffee,"This was my first ""coffee press"" a gift from my 13 year old son Mothers Day a year ago. I am assuming the sales girl talked him into this one. It actually works a bit in reverse so that the grounds are lifted out of the brew. The look is very stylish and it truly makes great coffee. However it is a bit messy. Getting the grounds into the basket always leaves some on the counter top. Now after a year of use it seems that the basket plunger piece which has not effect on anything other than appearance will not go back down easily... as if it has a worn part. However I hear that parts wear out of all of the presses so I don't know how to judge that. Over all I am happy with this product after a years use. It is also the perfect size for me. Great Coffee, great looks but a bit messy, it gets 4 stars from me!"
1,Innovative design - poor functionality,"I wanted a small stylish French press. This press is designed such that you fill the filter basket with coffee, then place it in the pot and pour in the water through small holes in the lid. After brewing, you pull the plunger UP until the filter basket locks into the top. After removing the lid for clean-up, you turn the plunger clockwise and push to disengage the filter basket. Therein lays my first problem. There is a small detachable piece designed to both grip & release the plunger rod. On the first try, the piece detached and the plunger would not disengage the filter basket. Repeatedly the plastic piece continued to pop off. As to the rest of the process, filling the filter basket with coffee is tedious in order to avoid making a mess. Pouring water through the small holes in the top is also a slow procedure. I returned the product for a refund. My advice, stick with the original French press design like the Bodum or BonJour lines of presses."
5,The best anime series ever!!!!,This is a good non-violent video for kids.But I'm 12 and I like it.(I also like Arthur on PBS!)
3,Not sure,"I give it 3 stars because it is exactly what I ordered; however, the hose connection is too large, and now I have to order an adapter. You would think a factory replacement would screw right on?"
5,Perfect fit and excellent flame!,I purchased this regulator to replace a replacement regulator I bought less than a year ago. The length is excellent and the fittings are perfect. The old regulator stopped allowing gas to flow so it would not product much of a flame. This new regulator allows the grill to come up to temperature very quickly.
2,nice color but not practical,shades are beautiful color and texture but see through at night. if your looking for blackout these are not the ones. will be buying curtians as well for extra layer. one shade is broken already and theve been up for 2 months. thats what i get buying cheap.
2,Pioneer's VSX-108,"It's Not Often That You Can Find A Receiver For Under $200, And When You Do, It's Good To Know It's Pioneer... Key Features *50W x 4 *Dolby Pro Logic *SFC *Subwoofer Pre-out Processing *Dolby Pro-Logic Processing *2 Simulated Sound Fields Power *Stereo: 50 watts per channel (40 Hz to 20 kHz, @ 8 ohm, 0.9% THD) *Surround: 50W x 4 (1k Hz, .9% THD) Convenience Features *Pre-Programmed A/V Remote Control *Subwoofer Pre-Output *3 Audio Inputs *Bass & Treble Controls *30 Random Preset Station Tuner"
4,Works as advertised,Good product. I have had no problems with it. I only rated it 4 stars because it can be a little tricky at times.
5,Excellent software. Efficient and inexpensive.,"It does everything it's meant to do. If you record movies from cable, like I do, this is THE software for moving those non copy protected DVD's to a Video iPod. Adding a ripper to Video Vault enables it to work on protected disks too.The program is being supported by Bamboo Technology. Clicking on the ""Upgrade"" button takes you to their web site, where you can download the latest version of Video Vault at no charge. This is important, since the latest generation Video iPod's only work with the newest version of the software.In all probability, if the two reviewers who panned this program had been a little more computer literate, they would have been able to get it to do whatever they required."
2,Not as Portrayed,It was not like the in-print edition. It was printed like a word document. Not what I wanted. I didn't want to pay for that.
3,Just as mediocre as the print edition,"I'm going to enjoy the free time on this, but will not subscribe to it.....having lived in Austin for decades, the AAS has considerably gone downhill in their reporting and their attitude towards their subscribers. I've not had an actual paper delivery from them for several years because they could never actually get it on my doorstep with any consistency. Not to mention their choice to bump the price of their paper up to $1 for weekday/sat and $2 for Sunday.....its not even worth the paper its printed on, and the Kindle version continues that. There are several stories I have already enjoyed reading that i otherwise would not have read, but it lacks substance.....I can see it being beneficial only if I am out of town, but I have no trip in the foreseeable future. Just wish they would add The Oregonian paper out of Portland OR.....I cannot easily get that, but if the AAS is a Kindle paper, why can't The Oregonian be one as well....."
3,How to unsubscribe?,"I can unsubscribe at any time during the 14-day trial period. I believe that even a klutz ought to be able to figure out HOW to unsubscribe, but I haven't."
2,Where's my newspaper?,"Just started the trial subscription. Got the first 3 mornings' papers delivered to the Kindle, but for the last 3 days, have not received any papers at all."
3,Missing content,"The description implies that all of the articles are included in the Kindle edition. It says it omits, ""some images and tables.""The issues I've received appear to omit ALL images, ALL tables, and a portion of the articles, too. For example, I was annoyed to see that all of the movie reviews are omitted. Also, forget the cartoons, even the editorial cartoons.I was also a little annoyed that the columns in the Opinions section usually gave only the last names of the columnists (e.g., ""Will"" instead of ""George F. Will, Washington Post""). Today, they just omitted the columnists names altogether.There are also frequently missing spaces between words, particularly following names that are in bold.Still, it's useful enough that I was willing to pay for at least one month."
1,Six Days in a Row - No Paper - I'm canceling,"On too many days, I received a message saying that Amazon and the American-Statesman had encountered a problem delivering that day's edition, and that they were working to fix the problem. Given that my other subscriptions never had this problem, I imagine they weren't working on it, and they just don't care.I'm canceling, as the American-Statesman cannot be counted on to deliver on the Kindle."
1,ENTIRE DAYS go missing,"I have subscribed to the Statesman on my Kindle.I woke up on Friday, June 26 and tried to read the paper, but my Kindle only displayed a message to the effect of ""We are sorry, but today's paper is unavailable."" They were probably scrambling due to the death of Michael Jackson the day before. No big deal, I figured, I'll read the paper later.NOW IT IS SATURDAY and although the Saturday paper have arrived on my Kindle... THERE IS STILL NO FRIDAY PAPER.Does that mean that the Kindle edition will only be delivered when it's a slow news day? Seems like it."
2,Content good. Reliability AWFUL,"The Paper content is pretty good but not as full featured as the New York Times. The absolutely worst part though is that I never knew if I would get a delivery for a certain day. I called Amazon Kindle support and their customer care reps in India could barely spell Kindle let alone resolve my problem. I emailed Austin American Statesman and I think they had to figure out how all that Kindle ""magic"" works. This is really bad for a Kindle newspaper. One of the reasons I am sold on newspapers for the Kindle is that you get it so much earlier and more predictably than from a newspaper carrier.. not so with the Austin American Statesman."
1,"Over 1 week, no delivery - Amazon Claims ""Late Paper""","This newspaper hasn't been delivered to me in over a week, I get ""late delivery"" messages instead. My other newspapers are arriving as scheduled, so it's got to be the Austin paper's issue. I'm cancelling today -- thanks a lot."
3,the beginning of a great band,"This album is descent for a debut. Not to mention they were a trio. The bass player doesn't really add much to the album, I would say Tim Dow's drumming and Allen's Screeching guitar work take center stage. The lyrics are awesome on this one, as are all of Allen's songs. I prefer their newer work (the egg, starless) but they had to start somewhere. Allen was the only original member that remained shiner through the years. Overall i give this one 3 stars, it doesn't suck, but it's not the greatest. I really like ""Bended Knee"", because of the phrase ""and in my head i heard 10 digits in a laugh""... I love it."
4,Shiner is cool.,"A great debut by an equally great band. Everything SHINER has done rocks with purpose, SPLAY is no exception. Rough around the edges in the best way, this one is worth the price of admission for the way it jams alone. Buy this and LULA DIVINIA and STARLESS and THE EGG as well if you want some kick [butt] music coming out of your stereo. Go to thirdgearscratch as well if you like it and check out some cool downloads. SHINER rocks."
3,good debut album,"It took a little getting used to but the more I listened to it the more I found the inherent genius behind the riffs. Of course, not all of it is listenable, or even catchy but Allen Epley has a foothold on talent that most musicians feign on the radio. And he's doing something different. It's one thing to be different and one thing to be good but it's an entirely new circle to be different and good at the same time. Especially during a period where many bands aren't doing either by themselves very well."
1,Very disappointing,"I hate this book. All the book is the repetition of the same code with very, very few differences. The description let's argue that is pointed to advanced users but the content is so basic that it is hard to believe. It uses SOAP in its most basic fashion. The code is so poor (also the HTML and the JavaScript used). The code is written in a so invasive fashion that if you strip it (and is not a bad idea), you will find no more than 30 pages.The Multi-Tier is just supposed to be good and misused.As you may understand, I strongly advise to not buy this book."
3,Disappointed....,"We bought this rocking horse 6 months ago as a Christmas gift for our daughter. She was thrilled and has loved rocking on it. We were pleased at first. It was easy to assemble, looks sturdy and was just what our little one wanted. 6 months later, with very light play (meaning our daughter is not rough with it, the horses head where the handles are, crumbled away. The horses head is made of particle board and the placement of the handles is less than 1/2 inch from the edge of the horses head. Had the handles been placed lower, this may not have happened. I see no way to fix this and the company has not responded to my email. I would be willing to purchase a replacement head piece...I already have an investment in this item. I do believe that they should replace it free of charge. Either way, a response would be the professional way to handle this."
5,These shoes are the bomb!!!,"I bought these in the bone color and liked them so much, I bought the red and the black. They are adorable and very comfortable. No regrets :)"
3,Nice shoes but...,"...not true to size. I wear 8.5M, however this particular pair is half a size smaller. Quite a surprise, given i got another pair of shoes from Two Lips size 8.5M(style Thunder) and they are perfect. Wouldn't it be only logical to expect guaranteed sizing standards from the same brand?"
4,Spreading Is Bliss With These Babies,"Now I admit, I bought a set of these to give to my mother as a little 4th party warming gift, but when I saw them up close and personal, I was captivated! I couldn't part with these....call me selfish, but she'll just have to get her own! Combining glitter, patriotism and aquatic life with spreading ease is a novel concept in my book."
3,What a bonus to the ill of mind,"These knives have helped me through a difficult time in my afternoon, the full force humor that they generously gave has brighted my World. I don't know how to thank you."
4,"oh, yeh","just recently got interested in beer making, this one was second try in brewing. beer taste good, easy instructions, no special tool needed. My only problem is to learn to increase carbination while stored in bottles. will buy this again."
5,Beer,"Shipped as stated and product as it was stated, happy with purchase. Look forward to buying more in the future. Thanks"
3,its ok not bad,its an ok amplifier not recomended for subs only for speakers.. its not very good for subs i have it on my speakers and works great though
5,Excellent biography of Tarski,"This is one of the best scientific biographies I've read. Alfred Tarski was not only an important figure in 20th century mathematics and philosophy, he was also an incredibly interesting and multi-faceted person. Anita Burdman Feferman and Sol Feferman paint a wonderful portrait of both Tarski, the man, and Tarski, the mathematician. Sol Feferman, himself an eminent logician and student of Tarski, provides insightful introductions to Tarski's main mathematical achievements in several ""technical interludes."" It is an easy read. The personal stories of Tarski's flight from Poland just before the Nazi invasion, his contacts with other noted 20th century philosophers, his influence on the development of logic and semantics, and details of his relationships with his students make for an engrossing, often moving, and always fascinating story."
2,H2Ocean - Body Piercing Aftercare Spray,Nothing special about it. This product didn't work well for me and my eyebrow piercing. Sea salts work much better.
3,H2Ocean - Body Piercing Aftercare Spray,This item does not really do much - I spray it on my nose piercing. I believe Sea Salt soaks work much better and is much cheaper.
5,Excellent Product,"This product was recommended by the person who pierced my 10 year old daughter's ears. We bought it and used it twice a day (morning and evening) on each ear. As a result, her piercing was flawless - no pain, no infection, etc. I highly recommend H2Ocean to everyone."
1,dont waste your money,"I have had this for 2years now and what a waste of money it has been. I have used this a few of times before I decided to toss them. This set was a disaster. The parer is dull period and the peeler peels off much more than just the skin, you lose almost 20%(no exaggeration) of the fruit or the vegetable."
5,Especially nice for anyone who needs a larger grip handle.,I simply adore this peeker and parer. It fits comfortably in the palm of my hand and the precision of control is fantastic. Granted I will probably use my smaller peeler on smaller vegtables but this peeler made easy work on pototoes and sweet pototoes.
1,This game isn't worth 50 Cent,"This is one of the worst games ever created. It deserves zero stars. Talk about pointless. The graphics are sub-standard, the storyline is non-existent and the game is solely based on violence. Now don't get me wrong, I usually don't have a problem with violence in video games but when there is absolutely no other point to the game, don't act like it has some story line. Mowing down cops and street thugs is not a storyline and it becomes so boring so fast it will make your head spin. You'll have more fun throwing your controller across the room after about ten minutes than you'll ever get from playing this piece of junk. If this game didn't feature the name ""50 Cent"" it would have landed in the bargin bin immediately. It's not even worth the bag it would come in if you were fooled into buying it. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage, not even for a rental."
4,rent..,"very good first person shooter. the missions SUCK after the first 5 stages are opened up..and its hard to figure out what to do in the latter levels so i just gave up. also its hard to target your guy when shooting alittle..but not alot. i just keep going through the first level in Queens getting as much money as i can to buy videos and music...but that will get old soon. rent it, its worth the experience..the exclusive music 50 did for it is good too...iLL ."
5,KOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!,this game is very good. if u like gta u will love this game. and im not a 50 cent fan. but this game is NOT for kids!
1,for shame,"it took 3 refills to steam one skirt,and what is with having to hold thebutton down ?Black and Decker...for shame"
1,Use only for travel,"I used this iron daily for almost a year before the temperature dial got stuck. It takes a lot of effort to iron clothes because it has a small ironing surface, it doesn't hold a lot of water, and the steam button requires an usual amount of effort to push. It also spits water like no else. I can only see this as being useful for travelers."
3,3 Parakeets and 6 Cockatiels,"They will pick at them every now and again.Nothing special,almost as bad as lafeber popcorn.They do love their avi cakes like crazy though."
5,Elvis means Meditation here.,"As the title says, gosple music and Elvis's incredible singing make this album a perfect relaxing treasure... Song selections are enough. If you feel you need to calm down sometimes just buy this cd and enjoy peace even though you don't believe what it says, voice of Elvis will be your own meditation. Timeless Elvis: Thank you."
2,You'll Never Walk Alone,"Although I have been an Elvis fan for many years, this was the first CD that I haven't really liked. Just not up to par."
5,Great Bed,"I bought this when I first moved into my apartment, because I was waiting on my furniture.This is a GREAT bed. I am glad that I bought it.PROS:-never looses air overnight (I'm over 200 lbs).-Strong electric motor/fan. Inflates/deflates very quickly-very soft textured top, luxurious feel.-compact storage and storage case works well, stores nicely-Nice full size-ability to fine tune firmness very easily with remote (great length)CONS:- a little pricey but worth itThis blows all my previous mattresses out of the water. It's on a whole other level than regular superstore/camping blow up beds. I still use this matress for guests, who always say they got a GREAT NIGHTS SLEEP.I highly recommend this."
5,Good Buy,"This is a wonderful bed! It is easy to inflate and even easier to deflate! It is all self-contained, easy to store, and great for sleeping on! I would recommend this bed to everyone!"
1,"Nice while it lasted, unfortunately that wasn't long",Bought this bed last year and at first it was wonderful. Then it started losing air. I repaired leak after leak but when it started leaking around the built in pump it just couldn't be repaired. It was used about a dozen times. I won't be buying another aerobed.
5,Very comfortable.,"I have 14 year old son over every weekend. He has been sleeping on sofa / futon for months. He always complained how uncomfortable it was. I bought a cheapo blow up camping mattress for 39.00. Then had to buy blow up motor on top of that. It was very uncomfortable and I even tried for a night. Back to the futon for him.Checked around and heard good things about this mattress. WOW, what a great deal. My son loves it. I put sleeping bag on top of mattress and it feels like real bed. Built in blower motoer is just topping on this product.Pleasant surprice, it actually fits in carry bag."
3,works only so long,"It has been one year almost to the day that I bought this mattress for nightly use. It is Very comfy, no doubt! However, within a short period the seams on the baffles where most of the pressure is put began to release from themselves inside the bed. Finally, the last gave way today, and I have a huge bubble across the middle of the bed where my tush or lower back is supposed to be. No leaks yet, but I don't think I can sleep with a huge malformed portion of bed under me, especially with lower back troubles.I guess this is what you get from a roughly $100 bed. So, what's to complain about really?"
4,AeroBed Premier Classis,"I ordered this aerobed to use while staying in my rental property for a month. I found it very comfortable and woke each morning feeling refreshed, rested and no aches or pains. It was very easy to set up and break down. I highly recommend this aerobed.It was delivered within a couple days of ordering and was in excellent condition on arrival.I would recommend purchasing a nice mattress pad to increase the comfort."
4,sprung a leak after 1 month,"This is my first air mattress so I can't compare to other brands and models. I slept comfortably for one month until it sprang a leak. Judging by how quickly this thing deflates it must be a visible hole. I tried soapy water, visual inspection in bright sunlight, running my hand and a fluffy feather along the surface to locate the leak source. All to no avail.-----ADDENDUM: I carried the air mattress outside to throw it away and decided to inflate it one last time to check for holes. I super-inflated it to absolute maximum capacity and three tiny pin holes appeared (invisible at anything less than maximum inflation pressure). It might have helped that the outdoor air was cold (no wind)so I could easily feel the escaping air streams. Circled the holes with permanent marker and covered them with transparent duct tape so I'll know where to check first if any future leaks happen."
3,Aerobed is not for everynight use,"Never comfortable with a conventional box and springs, and fearful of leaks with a waterbed, we wanted an air bed. We had previously purchased and returned a SleepNumber bed, which has a divider separating the two halves of the bed, so that one sleeper rolls onto the other, and sleeping on top of the divider is rediculous. We had tried cheap air mattresses, which leaked almost from the start. Finally got the Aerobed, and were delighted with it until it started leaking and coming apart after 4 months. We contacted Aerobed, and they said that the Aerobeds are NOT intended for continuous use. But nothing in the advertisements said this, and the price is high enough that we expected better than only being able to use it occasionally. Aerobed sent a replacement under warranty, and despite warnings that it isn't suitable for regular use, we are going to try it again. There just isn't any other game in town."
2,aerobed,"We have had aero beds in the past and have been VERY happy with them over many years. They are easy to inflate, very comfortable and easy to transport. This model, however, popped the first time we used it. We are unsure how, but think it might have been the twist tie that was wrapped around the cord. We feel that the quality of the casing should be such that it wouldn't pop the first time one uses it on a carpeted floor."
4,Aero bed Queen size,"I bought the Aerobed coz my friend suggested it who has been using it for a couple of years herself. I am very happy with the product. It is easy to inflate and deflate. I don't leave it on for a number of days, just overnight and it works awesome."
4,Happy with my decision to purchase this aerobed,"This aerobed was purchased to replace the uncomfortable mattress that was in our motorhome. We'd had an aerobed in the past, so I was confident of the quality and performance. It inflated quickly and completely, but at full inflation was a bit uncomfortable. The bumps on the surface seemed to hit my husband and me right in the middle of the back. He hit the adjust button twice and we were ""just right"". We did have a pinhole leak in the mattress that deflated a bit during the night, but we found the leak and patched it with the provided patch. The mattress inflates and deflates quickly and the adjust feature is great to customize to your needs. It provides a very comfortable night's sleep. I'd highly recommend this mattress - it's a good product and value."
1,Over 6 holes,"We ordered this bed for the ""if we ever need it"" type situation. We opened it up at 10 pm and we were surprised to see over 6 large holes in the bed. There is a seventh that we can't find. Brand new and it does hold air, even with with patches. Which we shouldn't need to patch on day one. We were just out of return it amazon. The manufacture says to ship it to them and they will take a look at it. I know this is probably the exception, but I really feel like I got hosed. This is probably the last time I ever get an inflatable mattress."
1,not a good value,I had to patch this mattress once and it has already developed another leak. I would not purchase this product again.
2,overpriced mattress,"This overpriced mattress is not as convenient as the commercials would have it. First of all you need a 2Xgh adapter and who has those in their homes to begin with? Secondly, you have to oil the motor with lubricant because it is a fan based turbine engine and it overheats really easy so if you keep on deflating it and then inflating it you are going to have major problems. The best thing to do is just buy a plain mattress and put it on the floor, it is probably a lot more comfortable than this plus you can eat corn on the cob with an ice pick."
1,DO NOT ORDER AEROBED,"Initially I was excited about getting such a great deal on an aerobed. When I received the product it had a huge nail going through all the layers of the mattress. I was extremely disappointed and frustrated, because I had several people staying over my house. I had to go to target and buy another one. Word of advice, do not buy an aerobed from this person."
4,great sleep over bed,I use this when ever the kids have a sleep over. Love the deflating feature and mattress cover for extra comfort.
4,Aerobed-Slumber Party Gear,These items arrived on time and worked great for my daughters first slumber party. They held up even though it was hard to keep the 4th graders from jumping on them. I hope to use them for many more slumber parties.
4,Very comfortable,I needed a bed for visits with my mom in her small apartment and this one fills the bill. It is comfortable and inflates quickly with no effort on my part. I can deflate is quickly and stash it away in the closet when not in use. A friend recommended I try it and I am very happy with it.
5,Great Value for Money,"We purchased this bed this past Thanksgiving for extra guests and it has been used probably 5 times since then, mainly by teenage boys who definitely abuse it quite a bit. It has held up great!! For $80 dollars and free shipping -- it's a fantastic deal!!"
2,doesn't stay fully inflated,"Mattress loses some air during the night and although you can still sleep on it, it goes from firm to soft. It was that way when it arrived but it seemed too much trouble to exchange it by mail. We still use it, but it probably would've been a better idea to buy it at a store nearby and be able to exchange it easily."
4,Purchased NEW recieved Used,"I purchased a new AeroBed Premier Classic from Amazon. When it arrived on the the specified date, the box was in poor shape and when I opened it, the plastic bacg containing the bed had been opened and the power cord was rapped up and jammed in the box. The been appeared to have been used. I contacted Amazon to arrange deliver of a new one before the date I needed the bed. The bed showed up two days after we needed it."
5,very good product!,"aero bed is really really good...i am sleeping on it everyday now. easy to inflat and deflat.no air leakage so far..i got it because it's too expensive to buy a realy bed, and i am only stay for 6 months here..but you can easily feel the difference between an air mattress and a real bed. i am still very much perfer a real bed, if I had money, i would by a real bed, at least a real mattress..."
5,I love this Aerobed!,"I have had this Aerobed for a few weeks and I have used it about 10 times. I used it while I was on vacation for a week and I was very comfortable. I have back problems so it is much better then sleeping on the floor. The built-in air pump works great and the bed fills with air in less then a minuet. I bought a twin, so the time may be different depending on the size. After it is deflated, I roll it up and put it into a 2O inch duffel bag. There is plenty of room to fit sheets and blankets too. So far I really love this Aerobed, I hope to have it for many years."
3,started to leak after a few inflations/deflations,"Very comfortable but began to leak after I inflated it a few times, after about two months. The company replaced it for free but the substitute was not as deluxe."
5,Amazing Solution,"I purchased this Aerobed, twin size, to go on the top bunk of a twin over full bunk bed. It turned out to be the perfect solution. My granddaughter recently visited from France and spent her nights up on that bunk and she declared it to be, ""very comfortable!"" It also makes it easier for me to make the bed as I let most of the air out of the mattress and fold it in half lengthwise. Then I put the bedding on the what will be the back side of the mattress and and unfold the mattress. Finish putting the bedding on the front side and then completely fill the mattress with air. It pops into shape with everything pretty well in place. Then I only have to put on the finishing tucks and it is ready for the next visitor. With a conventional mattress I'm not sure I could even make that bed!AeroBed Premier Classic with Comfort Zone Coils Twin Bed"
4,Totally satisifed,"This Aerobed works great and it's a better deal than several of their other modules. I use it only on rare occassions for guests, but everyone who's slept on it has been happy with. It inflates and delates easily, and stores nicely in the bag that comes with it."
4,Good service from AeroBed,"The bed was pretty much as described. The inflation/deflation mechanism works well. The fine tuning available for firmness is a nice touch. I purchased for my daughter to use during her two week stay with us and used it as the mattress for a ""Murphy"" bed I had just constructed. She said it was quite comfortable and neither too hot nor too cool (She's a Floridian visiting us in NY). I haven't slept on it, but intend to take it as the ""air"" mattress for use in our makeshift camp trailer and am sure it will be a comfortable addition. The only PROBLEM we had ... the enclosed mattress cover was for a TWIN bed when we had ordered the FULL size. Since the packing was done by AeroBed and not Amazon, I contacted Aerobed directly and they immediately shipped out the proper mattress cover to us. Very good service !!"
5,Awesome,Product as advertised and much better than any we have seen. Received in a matter of a few days. Greatttttt
3,Good Quality But Just above average comfort,"This bed quality is good. They senda cover to put on top of the bed that is good quality. But as the shape is up and down, when we will with tight AIR, it is some what discomfortable. we can reduce Air little bit to our comfort level. So that it will be fine.If possible go for a bit higher end. But for Sure we can trust this bed quality. Rubber smell is bit suffocating (Not so good for childrens having breathing problem), you can wash both bed ad cover as per the instruction mentiond and use, thats better. If possible put a sheet or cover on top of itGood Points:Cheap RateGood Quality BedGood Quality CoverCriticising Points:Have to adjust properly for comfortnessRubber smell is bit suffocating (Not so good for childrens having breathing problem), you can wash both bed ad cover as per the instruction mentiond and use, thats better. If possible put a sheet or cover on top of it"
5,Really good bed,"I am using this air bed for my ""every night"" bed. It is very comfortable, I can adjust the firmness easily, I don't ever have to turn it and I can replace it when that time comes much cheaper than an uncomfortable innerspring. It is kind of noisy when you let air out, but I don't mind. I am not going to be changing the firmness often anyway. I have tried the expensive air bed like you see advertised on TV but didn't like it because it is topped with a foam covering. Foam makes me overheat. This bed gives me the comfort of air without the foam problem. My bed is not as tall as it would be with the innerspring, but that is not a problem for me. I highly recommend this bed."
1,Wouldn't stay inflated after 3rd use,"I bought this as a guest bed and used it 3 times in 4 or 5 months. The last time I had a visitor, the bed would not stay inflated. I had a Coleman camping mattress that I used for years for guests until it finally gave up. I guess I will go back to that."
2,Somewhat disturbing!,"The characterization is very good, but the prince's treatment of Samantha is horrible. Verbally abuses her, privately and in front of others. Has no regard for her feelings. Speaks to her like she's a trained animal and tries to buy her off with a large box of ribbons. Horrible man! Would love to give the book 1 1/2 stars as the author does delve into the characters well. Have to be satisfied with 2 stars because of Amazon's system."
2,Disappointed,The beginning of this book was wonderful and I was hooked right away. Samantha is a sweet person who fell in love with Prince Rudolf right away. Prince Rudolf is the typical handsome man with a secret past.What I did not like about this story was how mean Prince Rudolf became. I don't mind when the hero is a little mean every now and then. But I felt Rundolf was over the top and for Samantha to forgive and forget all the time bothered me. It was hard for me not to throw this book across the room at times. I found myself skimming just to get to the end so it would be over.
1,Did I read a different book than the other reviewers?,"This was one of the worse romance novels I've ever read! The ""hero"" (I use the term very loosely) is absolutely despicable. He shows no respect for the heroine and is very condescending. He's an autocratic, uncommunicative bore who verbally and mentally abuses the heroine throughout the novel. ****SPOILER**** He abducts her the night she intends to announce her engagement and later seduces her, even knowing it will ruin her and knowing he will not marry her. The ""heroine"" is spineless and in need of some self-esteem. She wallows in self-pity and (to paraphrase the ""hero"") doesn't know how to do anything aside from cry and vomit (yes, he's surely a prince!). This book defines wall banger and it was a test of my willpower to simply finish it."
5,A fantastic book,I loved this book but at times wanted to throttle the main characther for being a jerk to Samantha. I love all of her books and am looking forward to more.
5,Very Romantic,"This book is very fast paced. I sat down one evening and by the next morning, I was finished with it. The flow is very smooth. I love how the characters are utilized from her past books, and yet, they can stand on their own. I am looking forward to reading more books in this series."
4,I could not put this book down...,"This book was fantastic.I bought it in Kathmandu before heading up to Lhasa by bus. Hopkirks incredible, true stories gave my journey to Tibet (and my extended stay there) much more meaning and significance. But that isn't to say that you have to go to Tibet to appreciate this book - its engaging stories of Westerners desperately trying to get to the sacred and forbidden city of Lhasa in the 18th and early 20th centuries is both accessible and exciting. Even if you never go to Tibet, you'll be amazed by some of the stories in here. And if you do go, this book is an absolute must read simply for historical context. I found it fascinating."
2,big disapointment from hopkirk,"this was a huge disapointment when you consider the""great game"" and other books of that age that hopkirk has written it was like chapter vignettes on getting to lhasa and getting beat up or getting killed by the nepalese the only truly interesting story was about the ""pundits"" east indians that were trained by the British to map the country by each step they took. they counted by pushing a bead on a nepalese rosary over, one by one. a nepalese rosary was 120 beads and their rosary was 100 beads, they carried prayer wheels and wrote the number of steps down and stored the numbers in the wheels they were never caught, they were true spies and very few of them were actually recognised by the british if these pundits were caught they would have been killed. this was a true story and only a chapter was devoted to it"
4,An intriguing book...,"I bought this book the other day, as I have often wondered exactly how boolean logic got instantiated in electronic devices, but couldn't seem to get past the first few pages of most intro texts. The author's style of writing is very engaging, and easy to follow. I was able to get through the first couple chapters sitting in the book store! I am looking forward to finishing the book, as it promises to provide me with a good grounding in this area. The biggest difference I saw in this book was the careful stepping from boolean logic at a simple level to more complex logic while simultaneously showing how it can work in circuit-form. Most books give the basics, then jump right into the circuit design as if you already get how to make the leap, (and I couldn't seem to get there on my own!!!)"
2,Confusing with lots of typos,"I bought this book at you do it electronics. I have an electronic mechanics background from when I was in the US air force. The book has what looks like a great organization, with 13 chapters, self tests on each chapter and a final exam at the end. The first chapter was pretty good but had a lot of either typos or printing mistakes that could have been prevented had the author proof read the pre production edition. The quiz at the end had a few mistakes in the answers but a proof read could have prevented them. The second chapter was very confusing with more typos. The sentence structure made it difficult to understand the concepts and the text constantly referred to diagrams or figures that were on other pages. The examples used to illustrate the concepts had mistakes in them which made them incomprehensible. The quiz at the end really frustrated me. I am so disappointed that I gave up trying to learn from this book."
5,Makes it very easy,Easy understanding. The way he teaches makes it less stressful and fun to read. I'd highly recommend this book. He also has several others that are just as good. I enjoy his technique!
3,"OK, not great.","I agree with reviewer Bookie. This book would require the reader to do a few Google look-ups, and probably view YouTube videos on various topics before fully comprehending what the author is on about. He misses a few steps and does not present materials in the correct order. Apart from a few kinks, it is a good introduction to digital electronics."
1,this book sucks,"Confusing. For novice learners DO NOT buy. Does not clearly explain even for basic things. I have to constantly go online to google and wiki many of the topics covered in this book, because of the poor explanations throughout the book. The author's mentality is like an English teacher trying to teach Shakespeare's to first graders"
2,Sprung a leak at month three,"Purchased the bed at the end of may, and it has been used for the last three months as a house guest's primary mattress. Sprung a leak around a week ago. The patch materials they included with it were horrible. The felt like top where the hole appeared would not allow for the patch to seal the hole. The hole itself was right along a seam. Sad that it took so little time for it to begin leaking. Because of that felty top, the bike patches would not work either. Finally, super glue, the original patch, and a lot of duct tape and the leak has slowed to needing to add air every other day."
2,unhappy,"It is a very good air mattress. But not knowing how to use this order process, I beleave that I could have purchased this item for less money. So that makes me not to happy with amazon.com. I will always make it a point to look elseware before I order again from amazon.com."
5,Gorgeous Bongos!,"I ordered these bongos on Monday and received them on Friday. I was amazed at the high quality. And, they are so lovely! I'm a clueless beginning bongo player, and these bongos just beg to be used! I'm looking forward to sitting down with these pretty things, checking out some youtube how-to videos and seeing what happens! Will be good entertainment for myself and my dogs while hanging out on the porch!"
4,"Big Sound, little space","The dorm parties will never be complete without the JVC MXJ300. For any student or anybody hard pressed for space but in need of 'big sound' this Mini System is it. It gives you the power and takes so little of your space. I enjoyed the sound quality and recommends this ""little Bomber"" to anyone."
3,hey,"i have only had one scoop of it so far so i am not going to tell you about the performance of the item, all i can say so far is that it is not totally unflavored because it does have an unpleasant after taste.thats all i got so far, keep buying healthy supplements shoppers!!!"
3,Better than expected,"This double feature has been transferred straight from video and is therefore rather scratchy and dark in places.The slumber party has some OK looking girls who get nekkid and look quite good.The casting couch has three girls doing a strip but it appears there is some 'looping' and repetition of shots (to make it appear longer, I assume). The camera work is quite good and the girls look OK.Both appear to have been filmed in the late 80's / early 90's."
5,I LIKE PAMELA,"I like what PAMELA D. BROWN said about how to take care of yourself when someone bullies you. I have never read a book like this one before.I hope that i can meet her someday, and tell her thank you for reading my mind. I'm going to tell all of my friends about this book and their parents also. I LOVE THIS BOOK!"
3,"Nice set, more used than thought","This was the last set I got online. It is really nice, the colors are bright and it did say used on the product discription. I am a bit disappointed with the traces of the use but still like the product."
1,Frustration Galore - they sent wrong item twice,I never did receive the item that I ordered and ended up buying at Target instead. Gave them a second chance - ordered item again and again received incorrect item. Will never order from that sender again for sure.
3,"Close, but no cigar","A simple, low priced rack. The item bought exactly matched the label on the item received. Unfortunately, the label and the item did not match. Oops.Given the low price we just kept and used the item we received, a different organizer from the same maker. It is sturdy enough, it expands and it holds stuff. We now have two from the same maker and we are satified with them.I can't comment on the specific unit listed because I didn't get it..."
2,Not item in picture,"I was excited to see this item back in stock after it was out for sometime. It arrived today and I immediately noticed it was not the ""knife"" drawer it is the regular expand a drawer from the same company. I am disappointed and will be returning it. It is a little too long for my drawers anyway."
1,Find something better,"Poorly made, flimsy construction and broke almost immediately. USB sockets pushed inside the unit and shorted connections. Would give no stars for quality if I were able."
1,Not Recognized,One laptop did not recognize the device and the other treated it like a mouse (and kept disabling my tough pad). Returned.
4,USB 2.0 A/B Switch,"Functions as promised, easy setup/use, small footprint. Item is small and lightweight, plastic case. Shipped quickly!"
2,Buy cables with it.,"I (apparently foolishly) expected to be able to plug a USB device into this switch and begin using the switch.You have to buy two USB A/B cables (the ones with a USB connector on one side and the square connector on the other) before you can try it.The lack of direct notification of these necessary cables of this was an inconvenience and not clearly stated. Hence, low score."
4,Didn't Need to Use This...,I didn't really need this for my immediate problem but I'm sure it will come in handy in the near future - for multiple keyboard/mouse/other USB device input switching.
5,Great Belkin USB Switch,I have a monitor with multiple inputs so I only needed to switch my mouse/keyboard combo. This is a great inexpensive way to share 2 computers. Highly recommened.
3,USB Switch,"I use this switch between by desktop and notebook computer. Both are made by HP. This units works as advertised except for the the hot key switch. The instructions say double click the ""Scroll Lock Button""(Hot Key). My notebook does not support the Hot Key. My desktop has a ""Scroll Lock Button"" but I have not had much success in switching with the Hot Key. I use it in manual mode only. I'm disapointed because I like to work with my Hot Keys."
4,not to bad,When i received the switch you could tell it was used and re-boxed. i emailed the company and never got a response back. the switch works fine but would like a better quality control.
4,Unbelieveble!,"This is a great book! As you get towards the end especially it seems made-up! But of couse it's real, Mrs. Youngberg was a good writter and woman! I still like ""Singer On The Sand"", for it's ephesis on the importance of remaining faithful to God, the best of all her books. This is a 5 for how interesting it is. Quite a book, get, read, be caught up in the story!"
5,Great for small vegis,Perfect size for mushrooms & smaller vegis or vegi pieces. Helps get some of the pesticides & ecoli washed off.
2,A little too much like life as it is,"Life as it is...almost. That's the tag line of the movie, and that's it's downfall as well. The movie is sweet and all but it's just kind of boring. Nothing that funny or charming or lovable about it, it's just there."
1,Worst Company ever,good luck trying to get all the items you ordered and better luck getting them with out being damaged!!!! They then promise to make good on it and still the items come damaged or they re-send the incorrect ones...
4,Great Mini Plier,It's designed well. And very useful in this size.But the black coating of the handle is not quite solid.Will see the metal dots after the black coating has been scratched.
4,Good,Pro: The material is decent. Finish and overall quality is good (though lower than Swiss Army's). The plier is strong.Con: Blade is not sharp enough.Good combinations for the price.
2,So-So Gerber Product,"Picked it up on sale for $9 bucks. After using it a few times, I wish I would have spent the money on a large pizza. I wanted to give this to my wife for everyday use, but the quality is not very good. The various blades are so difficult to pull out my wife broke a nail on the first try to access the flat head screwdriver. I checked it out and found that using a key on my key chain worked best, but using an object to access multi tool kinda defeats the purpose doesn't it. I thought to loosen the screws a bit, but found that I would need the worlds smallest allen wrench/ star key. Instead of buying a new set of star wrenches I decided to cut my loss and tossed it into my junk drawer. Sorry Gerber; I love your Gator knife (awesome knife!) and other products, but you guys missed with this one."
4,Almost perfect...,"I got this at a great buy at Amazon and use it primarily for fly fishing. It is sturdy, has that great Gerber quality blade, and a number of handy attachments. It folds up neatly and very compact. It's light weight and durable. The only thing missing that I wish it possessed is a scissor."
5,Bang for your buck.,Small with a lot of features. Got it as a great gift for my work buddy. He loves it and it's perfect for his keychain. It's win.
1,Seems great at first...,"I bought the Clutch to replace my Leatherman Squirt that was taken from me at the airport. I saw and felt the Clutch in a store and thought it would be much stronger than my Squirt was. I am very disappointed in the quality of the tool, though. I have already sent mine back once for a broken pliers (under warranty), and now my replacement doesn't hold the knife blade in place if I try to cut anything. The ""strength"" and heft of the tool is all smoke and mirrors - it's actually a very weak tool. I keep it in my pocket everyday, but rarely use it for anything but a knife. I'm very disappointed overall and will move back to Leatherman next time. The Lifetime Warranty is nice, but at the price to ship it back to them I can just buy a different tool that won't cause problems."
1,Pliers broke after 5 uses - bottle open is poor,"I'm unimpressed with the strength and quality. The lockout on the pliers broke the first time I needed to apply some moderate grip strength. Now I can fail the pliers by squeezing my finger. The bottle opener is poor. I often ended up using the pliers to open bottles. After 4 weeks, its in the trash."
1,Tiny metal supporting blade is very soft,"I've had this for just 31 days when I used the blade to crack chips off a block of chocolate (note chips, I was not intending to slice through the block). I was pointing the blade tip down so that I wouldn't apply too much stress on the blade but the blade slipped outwards anyway. The small strip of metal, that kept the blade snugly in place, bent outwards. Now the blade is loose and doesn't click in place.My > 10-yr old Swiss Army pocket knife is a lot sturdier than the Gerber Clutch mini tool."
3,Sexy but don't expect long term commitment,"Useful combination of tools and great snap-shut design makes this tool sexy and you'll develop an attachment to it. However, there will also be heart ache, which for me was that the pliers snapped after about 6 months of use when I used a bit too much force on them one time. Given the quality, don't pay over $15 for it."
4,Good stuff,"Always a high-quality product. I plan to experiment with using it with watercolors instead of acrylics this time. I gave one less star because the matte, which I prefer, wasn't shown as available until after I'd ordered the gloss."
4,Hmm.,"I bought one of these at a rummage sale, no instructions, not non-stick. I thought it was for grilling vegies and other small foods on the BBQ and it works great, they don't fall into the fire. It would probably work as a wok steamer basket too. But how would you stirfry with something that doesn't hold oil? Hmm."
2,not so good,Delivery as always from amazon was fast...Thank you. the product its self is not the best. It's a pretty creeky bed. Fairly easy to assemble but not too sturdy.
5,hoffritz stiahless steel vegetable peeler,This is absolutely the best vegetable peeler anyone could ever want in their kitchen. You can also use it to peel off carrot or cucumber bits for decoration.
1,Freeze-dried egg horror,"If you take a package of these on a camping trip, you will have to be very, very hungry to be able to eat it. Mountain House freeze-dried scrambled eggs cost about 10-15% more and are so much better. I was really disappointed with this this product. High sodium content, which is to be expected, but virtually tasteless. Eggs stayed dry and dusty even when prepared according to directions. One positive: very tough, sturdy packaging. I ate out of container with a fork, didn't puncture it, and was even able to re-use for carrying granola, water, several times without any leaking."
4,Factotum,"I heard an interview with Kristin Asbjornsen on PBS and some of her compositions were played. I immediately liked the simplicity of her writing and her captivating voice, singing the dark poems of Charles Bukowski. Many times I delve into these moods myself, so I don't find this style depressing at all. Actually it encourages me to accept the whole spectrum of my being and use it for creative purposes.larry redhouse[...]"
3,"Good, could be better","Farscape suffers from the lack of competition on sci-fi television. Most everything is really bad these days, so Farscape is near the top of the trash heap. That does not make it great. Some episodes are great, but then the writing or character development goes south and the show falters in a big way. Stargate SG1 is better written, but it has to be- relying more on the dialog than costumes and special effects than Farscape. What I really hope for is ""strange frame""- a show that is well written and based on some sort of science, not fantasy- I mean both Farscape and Stargate rely on the improbablilty of traveling through a matter-crushing worm hole- hardly original and hardly science fiction."
3,ADV is still ripping us off,Farscape is *the* best series on TV today. But ADV was *the* worst company to give the DVD rights too. Granted getting 4 episodes instead of 2 is an improvement but they are still on 2 discs and could have fitted on 1 disc.The sound in the deleted scenes is so poor it's nearly impossible to hear and understand even with the tv at maximum volume.Also American customer are not being given any of the goodies that UK customers received with their DVD's.Let's hope that anything Henson makes in the future they will licence to a better company when Video rights are sold.
4,a very good system,"the mx-j200 has good sound and great bass, it lacks clearity because of the small tweeter but overall it is a great system with good sound...and you get your moneys worth."
1,Invincible? I don't think so...,"My dog is a bit of a chewer and we've gone through a lot of toys to keep him busy. We decided to get this one because it claimed to be invincible, but a more accurate descriptor would be easily-torn-into-unrecognizably-small-pieces. Our dog had the links apart and in marble sized hunks in a number of minutes. Don't waste your money!"
3,"Have an open mind, and you'll like this one!","A friend of mine had a video store and she gave me a copy of this movie. I watched it with my mother! We thought it was hysterical and I immediately rewound it and watched it again! I took it to my Uncle's-he watched it and ALSO immediately watched it again! Since then, I went on to lend it to various people and the majority of them thought it was hysterical. The two people that didn't like it really hated it. And one girl I loaned it to never spoke to me again except to say that her husband loved it! It's full of crazy twists and turns and it's very racy. I think you should watch it for yourself, there were so many stars and plots going on. It's soo crazy to explain the plot but if you're not a prude, give it a shot."
4,Brilliant and Hilarious Satire,"Paul Bartel's funniest film after EATING RAOUL, SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS is possibly his most clever as well. Featuring an all star cast the film starts with a bang and never lets up. Mildly schocking, extremely irreverant, not quite as dark as most of his other works, it still holds up well after several screenings. The direction is crisp, the music is first rate (especially two pieces for piano by Debussey) and the acting is all first rate. Especially terrific is Wallace Shawn. Often laugh out loud funny, this is one of Bartel's better movies and possibly one of the best comedies of recent years. Sort of a kinder and gentler John Waters, Bartel's delightfully wicked sense of humor certainly does have some bite. Very clever and more deserving of a reputation than it has. Worth a look for sure!"
4,Purchased for TDK boombox,"The Pyle-Pro tripod is a good, sturdy PA speaker stand. It didn't come with an adapter cap so make sure the hole in your speaker is right for the stand. PA speakers come primarily with 2 different size holes in the bottom. I think it's 1 3/8"" and 1.5"" / the Pyle-Pro I purchased is the smaller of the two. I bought the Pyle-Pro tripod as a stand for my TDK 3 Speaker Boombox. Unfortunately the hole in the bottom of the boombox is neither 1 3/8"" OR 1.5"". After later purchasing an adapter cap (to go to 1.5"") for the Pyle-Pro, I learned that it now was too large and wouldn't fit the Boombox. I now have the tip of the tripod wrapped with electrical tape to insure the TDK 3 Speaker Boombox has a snug fit and doesn't wobble on the stand. I'm happy with the Pyle-Pro tripod stand and I'm happy with the TDK 3 Speaker Boombox, the two just don't work togeather adequately without some modification. Cool stereo but the tripod mount is just a novelty idea that wasn't thought out"
1,Very Disappointing Customer Service !,"While this tripod speaker stand appears to be very sturdy, it arrived with a broken locking screw. The knob on this screw was broken as the packing was very poor. When I contacted customer service at Pyle, I was bounced around to three different persons and ended up leaving voice mail message requested the locking knob/screw be sent to me with my address. That was over three weeks ago, have not received a call back and no replacement part has been shipped. The tripod sits in its box on my office floor as it is unusable since you cannot lock it open. I haven't had time to follow up on this but it is unbelievable that a company can have such a lack of customer service."
1,Don't buy this item,"Like others have stated in other reviews, the packaging was so cheap that the item arrived with a broken knob. Good price and good quality but it will be broken when you get it. Can't wait to see if I can get a replacement part without returning the whole item. Oh joy.Not worth the trouble."
5,Exactly as described,I bought this for my new TDK 3 speaker boom box as I plan on using it outside for bbq's and parties. The box it came in was pretty beat up but the stand inside was not damaged at all. The Pyle PSTND2 came fully assembled and ready to use. It appears to be a very sturdy and high quality stand. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality inexpensive stand.
5,Great Product,This product came and is exactly as described. It is nice and sturdy. It will function perfectly for our events.
2,Too Bad,"Was hoping for the best after seeing the bad reviews. Got it today and the box was mangled. Alot of packing tape on it, holes in box, tears in box. Opened it up and the KNOB was broke, Other mounting hardware gone, and the product description paper inside was almost shredded. Obvioulsly I got a returned item sent to me. Pyle needs to package these with more thought."
4,Speeker Stand Value,"Good Product that comes with a nice price. The legs have a good support range that lets you fit into some tight places, with a lite load. The knobs for tightening seem cheep (work OK) but the safety pin works well to cove if you have a slipping problem. I expect to buy another very soon."
3,Very Nice Stand - But!,"This is a very nice stand. Very well built, strong. Upon using for the first time I went to tighten the adjusting knobs---and guess what, they broke. The adjusting knobs are very poorly built and literlly fell apart when I attempted to tighten them. The stand is very nice and I can't believe the manufacturer would use such shoddy hardware. If you purchase this stand understand you'll run into the same problem and wind up at a hardware store buying new adjusting knobs. The knobs are not expensive to replace; the point is I purchased the stand to use not to fix. I can return it to Amazon, but, I'm confident the replacement will have the same problem."
3,Another broken knob...,"I was also one of the unlucky ones get one with a broken knob. The reason for this was evident right away. Right when I opened the box I found it strange there was no packing material. It was just thrown in an empty box. Then when I saw the broken knob I was not surprised. Maybe the plastic for the knob is cheap. But, trying to save money by not using packing material is no excuse.P.s. I fixed it with some super glue."
1,Appalled,"I am appalled that this book would even be published. Not only is this book unnecessary but distasteful and disrespectful, especially to the victims' families. I am a daughter of one of the victims, and to hear that this garbage is out there and that William Suff is getting any type of recognition as well as a profit for the heinous crimes is disturbing. Maybe there should be a book about the hard times and the pain and the impact this made on each family and what they had to overcome. Not some sick deranged man, that is getting credit for killing women."
1,hideous bilge,"Hack screenwriter Brian Lane tries to capitalize on his being a serial killer's lawyer with this mess of a publication, a witch's brew of foul ingredients: multiple murderer/mutilator William Suff's own pathetic fiction, Lane's wimpy justifications of his own unfortunate past, and believe it or not: a cookbook by Suff ! Includes sickening photos of Suff's victims, and ludricrous alibis for the very unphotogenic Suff."
2,A Reader from Georgia,"I thought the book was very disturbing. First of all, it skipped around too much and it delved into the life of the author, which I found strange. Secondly, why did they have to put those awfully graphic pictures in there? And third, the short stories and cookbook were totally inappropriate material for the topic of the actual book. Another thing, why did they give Mr. Suff's family(Don)half the proceeds from this book? It should've went to the victims families. And last might I add that Kimberly Lyttle had been a childhood friend of mine whom I had not seen in years and I was truly devastated by her death and the fact that she left behind a daughter and father who loved her."
4,Better than I thought it would be...,"I rented this from Netflix (as I do most of my concerts) and am currently watching it for the first time as I type this real-time review.The video is impressive considering it was 1999, and I'm watching on a 42 inch HDTV. Nice and clear, although it's stretched because of the FULL SCREEN format of those times.The audio is also quite good on my 5.1 surround system. As mentioned in other reviews, the vocals are a bit buried in the mix, and that's unfortunate. Otherwise, the sound cuts the mustard, especially for such an old concert without a big budget. Good mix of instruments, much better than I expected.I highly recommend this DVD (even for users with modern HD and surround sound sytems) if you're a .38 Special fan."
3,Poor Vocals,This concert was great except that the vocals seem too low and rather than using the center speaker they are phase delayed between the front right and left which makes for neat effects but I find myself straining to hear the vocals. Just not up to par with other recordings I have heard.
1,"Buy the CD, NOT THIS DVD!","First of all, I love 38 Special and love every song in this concert. I listened to their Live at Sturgis concert on CD for over a year before ever viewing it on DVD. After much anticipation to see the concert as it was performed that day, the DVD left me very disappointed. Maybe I'm spoiled on Bruce Springsteen concerts produced by Jon Landau, but the video footage from this concert is ""decent"" only if judged by early `80s VHS standards. I found it pathetic and the audio poor as well. Hopefully these guys will do a modern filming production of a concert some day. Until then, buy the CD instead."
3,"I could give more, but.......","I recently purchased this DVD not knowing it has been available for some time. What a great concert. A typical .38 Special show, but I was looking for the ""dueling drummers"" that I have seen in concert. Love the camera work and presentation. I noticed very little discoloration in the video. But the time-coding on my DVD is messed up. The music to video matching is off all the way thru my disc. I would rate this production a 5 star if it was not for these errors. And I have emailed the label and they responded that they have not had any problems such as this brought to their attention, and offered to replace it if my place of purchased produced the same results on the 2nd one. My local retailer is currently out of stock, and will try that asap. So if yours does not have this problem, we are dealing with a 5 star recording of .38 Special!"
2,A Poorly Disguised Infomercial,"Don't get me wrong; I'm a major fan of Penn and Teller. I have all of their books, and I think their Showtime production ""Bulls*it"" is great.But I watched this program when it aired on regular television, and I'm disappointed to report that it's mostly a commercial for the tropical Atlantis resort, pitched by Penn and Teller. Sure, they perform some impressive tricks, and yes, there are a few funny scenes. But it was painfully clear that the production was foremost a promotional device for the Atlantis resort.As an alternative, I highly recommend Penn & Teller's Magic and Mystery Tour."
1,Calendar Clock,"I ordered this clock for my elderly mother, so she would know the date and day as well as the time. Unfortunately, the clock didn't work. I put a battery in and the second hand began it's sweep. After just a few seconds, it stopped and just sat and ticked. The time, date, and day didn't advance of course.I emailed the seller asking for an RMA# and a refund. I paid $25.67 for the clock and $10.76 shipping/handling. When I returned it, I paid another $10.70 shipping, a total of $47.13. The seller is refunding only $25.67. I won't recommend this seller to other buyers. And I certainly won't recommend this clock!"
5,love them,This band played at my bar Smalls in pennsylvania. I was blown away they are the best band to ever come we did 300 shows a year and they were awesome. I have both discs and this one is my favorite it is fun and infectious. Buy NOW
5,Outstanding coverage of secret technologies kept Hidden,Excellent book on a very mysterious and captivating subject. You will find out what the government does not want you to know. Telsa was a geneoius born before his time. He produced what no man could produce at the time Steath technology. Learn about the saga and the power mongers who tried to use the power. Learn about how Telsa technology and others are being used by our government to produce Super Machines Never before dreamed of by man. Take the Book and join in the adventure into the future.
1,HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA,This book is such an obvious put-on that it is hilarious beyond belief! A real side-splitter!
3,Vinyard Visitors,"Finding Martha's Vinyard is entertaining. The accounts of the residents were repitious, but it reveals that all were motivated to spend summers there by the same reasons. It is good that the present residents have found their slice of paradise and peace. Although I had heard of the Vinyard, I knew nothing about it. So, this book falls under the heading of pleasant education."
1,Eyes Of Terror Gumballs,I buy these normally every year and used them in fruit punch for a gory effect of floating eyeballs in blood for halloween.I have no longer seen these in my local stores around here so i'm glad i found them here.
3,Lackluster first effort for a great band,"This is the Dismemberment Plan's first full length release and it really shows. Its very crunchy and raw, and I have no problem with that, but Travis Morrison's voice sounds more like Isaac Brock from Modest Mouse than himself. The music is much more frantic than their more recent releases as well, it sounds like if you put Modest Mouse, Fugazi, and Jazz June together in a blender, and added in the musical oddities of the Dismemberment Plan.This CD is obviously a must for hardcore Dismemberment Plan fans, but if you are just looking to check out the Plan you should probably buy Change or Emergency and I first. Those are the two best releases by this band, and are more likely to please someone who is giving the Plan a shot for the first time. However, if you are a hardcore fan this CD is a good way of seeing where the Plan has come from. It's certainly interesting."
3,"Entertaining, but pre-mature","There is no doubt that the Dismemberment Plan are one of my favorite bands of all time. But as much as I love their music, i have never really fully enjoyed this album. Compared to Change or Emergency and I, this album shows a completely different band. It's loose, noisy, and disorganized, which works, but not in the same way that their new stuff does. Get this if you're a die-hard Dismemberment plan fan, and don't expect it to be anything like the new stuff."
3,Beware the Scales!,"My husband ordered these fish plates as an early Mother's Day present thinking they would blend nicely with fish glasses we already own as part of a picnic set. Unfortunately, what he did not know and what you cannot fully see in the picture is that these fish have scales, which may make them less than appetizing platters for some meals."
2,Dont waste your money,I bought this for my dog thinking it would be more durable for tug of war (he chews up the rope ones). The first day he had it he chewed a hole through one of the rings. It was also difficult for him to play with it. My dog couldn't get a good grip on it when I tried to play tug of war and as a result did not want to play with it.
3,Too Big,"The JW Pet Company Invincible Chains Triple Dog Toy, SMALL is not well-suited for my 12 pound poodle. First the rings are too thick/round in diameter and are too heavy. My little guy loves to tug and thought this would be the perfect toy for him. I've had it for about 2 weeks now and he hardly plays with it. He'll pick it up, take a few steps with it then puts it down and finds another toy to play with. I'd say it's sized more for a med to med/large dog."
5,Baltimore RAVENS 2000 season DVD,This DVD is so exciting. I have season tickets to the RAVENS games and this DVD brought more insight to what really happened that season. Our first Superbowl....loved the DVD.
1,Disappointing Book,I was very disappointed in this book and would not buy it again or recommend it to others.
1,Very disappointed,"First of all, the clock is actually attached to the box with a strange contraption that required a screwdriver to remove. Even then, the box had to be destroyed to remove the clock, very annoying. Only once I had completed this difficult maneuver did I realize that the clock is very poorly designed. Some how, in some strange way, the face of the clock (where the hours are marked) is attached to the frame, but NOT to the hands. What this means is if you bump the clock while it's on the wall, the hands stay in one position and the numbers move independently. I kid you not! So unless you plan to put this on a wall where no one will ever touch it, I would recommend you avoid this item.I'm considering returning it, I just haven't decided if it's worth the trouble. One last note: the lower edge of the outer design is misshapen. It seems to be the way it was cast (I believe it's resin), not a flaw with my specific item."
4,Worked for me,"The apparatus seems a bit flimsy, and I cannot attest to whether it will work on all the varieties of bulbs it claims, but it worked for changing a regular indoor flood from a high ceiling. There really is no other option other than hiring someone to come in with a huge ladder, so this thing pays for iteself in 1 use if you have a ceiling like this."
1,Junk,"This Bayco Bulb Changing Kit is a piece of junk. I purchased at a DIY store, I thought it would be very helpful for the recessed lights in our home's soffit. It broke in the first few minutes of use. Suction cup is also worthless. I found this to be a very cheaply-made and poorly designed product. If you value your time and money, look for something else."
1,Not so great movie.,"There was nothing to indicate before purchase that it was not in English. In addition, the story line was very slow."
2,August evening,"i came fast, but unfortunatelay the directors commentary does not work. i check it 3 different computers, but does not come up. i really need this commentary for my coursework.thank you"
2,Ummm...,"I really hate this show. It's too innapropiate for kids. In ""First time at the beach"" Laura touched Kana's butt when she swam!"
3,"Good picture, not so good audio","The picture is very good; however, the sound quality is not very good--intermittently, it gets louder and softer by itself, and sometimes there is a lot of ""noise."""
3,Roughly 3.5 stars,"Okay, I love me some BJ, but I was a little disappointed by this book. I don't think it lived up to her other novels like Topaz, Vivid or Winds of the Storm. I enjoyed the book more because I read along with an audio CD performed by Thomas Penny. He is brilliant. I agree with the other reviewer about the climax, I which there was more. Jessi and Griffin's love seemed liked it just appeared out of nowhere, but the loving sure was good. The reader did not know the whole story about Jessi's past until the last couple of chapters. Even though this was not one of my favorites, I would still recommend this book. Try it with the audio CD."
2,Did she really need to be tamed?!?!,"I think Jesse Rose needed to be unleashed! I've always enjoyed Beverly Jenkins' books, though I must say I was not ""feeling"" this one. Why? Maybe it had to do with the older woman, younger man plot. I'm not sure, but the main character left me feeling void of something, she was too sappy (almost a charity case, as if Griffin felt sorry for her). I've read five of her books and this is the only one I didn't like."
3,"Not the best, but still interesting","This book isn't one of my favorites by Beverly Jenkins, but it still held my attention for the most part. I liked the storyline of a 32 year old woman and a 25 year old man because it was something different from her other works.However, the plot seemed to get lost and so did the chemistry between Griffin and Jessi. Some of the scenes were just way over the top and I found myself thinking -- huh??? The good news is that there are some of the classic, non-cheesy (or sleazy) love scenes found in all her books. The Terrible Twins will have you laughing outloud and I'm glad we got to see a little bit of Dixon Wildhorse in here too.All in all, I would recommend that fans of Beverly Jenkins read this one just to keep up with all characters and their background story since they will keep popping up in her other books."
3,Not her best work,"Always and Forever was the first book that I read my Ms. Jenkins.I thought it was fantastic! Unfortunately, The Taming of Jessi Rose in comparsion isn't half as good. Griffin and Jessi lacked chemistry. There was no magic. Jessi's problem over shadowed thier romance. They didn't even really have time to fall in love.I did like that Jessi was strong and brave and didn't allow all she had suffered to break her spirit. Which is why I gave the book 3 stars instead of two.Sensuality rating 3 out of 5."
4,Age ain't nothin' but a number....,"This was a great story...I loved Jessi and Griff. Although, Griff was younger than Jessi, (only by seven years) he had lived a thousand lives. He was a real, FINE man with enough maturity and heart to shower Jessi with all the love she'd ever need. I also enjoyed catching up with Dix Wildhorse from ""Topaz"" and meeting Preacher and the ""Terrible Twins"" Two Shafts and Neil July. They had me laughing out loud with their special brand of justice. Beverly Jenkins is awesome, much respect!"
5,A wonderful peeler,"To be honest, I ordered this by mistake, but I LOVE it. The peeler section is longer than other brands' -- perhaps the added length gives one more control. Also, the handle is very comfortable. It does a great job on potatoes, carrots and cucumbers. No problems putting it in the dishwasher. And it looks cool.A peeler is a small thing, but a good one is a treasure."
1,Buy OXO instead,"First off, I bought this worthless peeler so I could get free shipping on my total order. Mistake on my part. The blade swivels. But why??? I could peel neither a hard apple, nor a soft pear. I prefer the strong stability of the OXO peeler I currently use. Would not recommend this product."
3,Solid construction but peeling could be better,"I bought this peeler to replace my cheap one that is wearing out, but after peeling a few potatoes, I noticed that you have to angle it right to peel the potato skin off. If you are peeling a few potatoes a day, it won't be a big deal to you, but I peel a whole 10 lb. bag a day and I need something better like my last peeler. So I am back using my old peeler until I find a replacement for it."
4,Carefresh Pet Bedding,"Very interesting recycled paper product. It might be 60 Liters uncompressed but as received it would fit in a five-gallon bucket. Nice for storage, but, the longer it sits the more of it that uncompresses and it takes up more room. I am using the product in a cage for my magnificently spoiled rat. I noticed that immediately upon using this product her sneezing went almost to zero. Had been using pine chips. Never again. It is a very absorbent product. Cage does not have the ""occupied by a rodent"" smell as bad. Plus she seems to like to play in it, shoving it into piles, moving the piles from corner to corner, and burying things she's found on her out-of-cage episodes."
5,Love this,"I've used this for several different kinds of animals (currently a guinea pig) and find it to be far superior to wood shavings. It's easy to clean up, doesn't smell at all, is recycled, and a little goes a long way. It's pricey but worth it."
1,Be careful,"I purchased this product thinking it was a pretty reasonable deal for the amount it came with. I didn't, however, notice the reviews regarding the few pets who seemed to have gotten sick due to this bedding. Soon after I changed the bedding for my robo hamsters, one quickly became extremely sick. No other conditions had changed other than the bedding. My hamster apparently developed respiratory issues that were too extreme for a vet to fix and she passed away shortly after. I checked the packaging before using it and there were no clear indications of the exact ingredients used. This could be simply an isolated incident, but I would be weary of this particular product."
1,waste of money,"I was looking for an alternative to chedar chips after I found out they were not good for my guinea pigs and also caused too much dust.This bedding does nothing for odor absorption, the cage stinks horribly right the next day after I replace the bedding. It is too expensive in my opinion, I thought a big bad would last me about two weeks or even more. I do not reccomend this at all!"
5,No stinky gerbils!,"This bedding is great. No ""animal smell"" in the house with this product. My little guys love it, building caves and such. It's not dust-free, but there is WAY less dust than with other types of bedding. I've kept gerbils for over a decade, and this is the best thing I've found."
2,Over Rated,"This stuff is not too bad or good. I have used it for 5 years for my first guinea pig and now with my new little piggy. This stuff smells weird in a bad way, right out of the package. It does not help much with the animal odors either. I change the cage every week and on that last day it smells really bad. I also use a lot of this stuff for a thick bed layer(3 inches) and it's expensive. I will retire this stuff and look for a cheaper alternative."
5,"GREAT PRICE, EXCELLENT QUANITITY and QUALITY","Great price great product. Need I say more? Shipment arrival time was perfect. My rats love this because it's still like the ultra care fresh, but just cheaper for me. LOL. Clean piss and s***ting material haha"
5,Excellent bedding,"This bedding is perfect for my guinea pigs, but also great for rabbits, hamsters, rats, etc. It's very absorbent, keeps odor to a minimum and is very soft on their feet. Initially, there is some dust, but nothing major. It will pack down (like snow) and its very easy to scoop. I wouldn't use anything else."
3,Not my favorite...,"While I don't mind Carefresh for my rats, I will say that I don't prefer it. MY biggest gripe about it, is that it consistently has a strange odor. Its not necessarily bad, just weird. It does absorb rather well, and the regular gray color hides 'droppings'. If you can get passed the odd smell of the bedding then you may like it more, but I had to switch to a combo of soft-sorbent mint and fresh world bedding. It is my favorite thus far."
2,Not a good choice for multiple gineau pigs,I used this bedding for months when I got 2 ginuea pigs for my daughter. After a while I could not even go a day without the bedding smelling and also it made the ginuea pigs smell worse. They already have a natural odor but it seemed this particular natural bedding made it worse. Maybe it's beause I have multiple gineaus. I change the bedding and clean the cage about every other day but the odor was not plesant even after a change. Finally we switched to the colorful ones but same brand and the smell is not bad. I can stand the smell of them again. I was seriously contemplating getting rid of them becuase of the odor. Hopes this helps you.
1,stay away,"It seems they changed the formula for carefresh. Do not buy this. It will make your pets really sick with respiratory issues. It will even annoy humans health. After having this in my rats cage for 3 days, I noticed their eyes were irritated and one had trouble breathing. After reading some of the recent reviews with pets getting sick and dying, I immediately changed the bedding to aspen and I won't be using the rest of this carefresh bag. STAY AWAY"
3,What's That Smell?,"This is my first time using this product, and while it provides excellent absorbency and urine odor control, it has a strange smell. I am also not impressed with the rough texture of the product, although my hamster does not seem to mind burrowing into it."
2,Smell and roughness bother me,"What happened to the quality of Carefresh? I have been repeatedly buying Carefresh directly from Petco for more than three years. In 2010 I switched to use fleece for my guinea pigs' bedding and now I am back to paper-based bedding, I ordered 12 of 50 liter bags in two orders. They are totally different products from what I used to use.They all smell like garbage and texture is really coarse. I feel the roughness is bothering my pigs' tender feet. They are dingy gray brown in color, which is much darker than before. It can control pee smell, but it gives out that dried garbage smell.I need to find alternatives since Carefresh's quality decreased so much. Very disappointed."
1,Do not use for Guinea Pigs,My guinea pig was in this bedding for 5 days and got exremely sick from it. If you look in the small print it tells you to contact a Vet if your animal consumes to much of the product. Last time I checked guinea pigs and most rodents eat what ever the can find to chew on. It took two visits to the vets and 2 weeks to get him back to himself. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!
3,Litter for all kinds.,I like this litter because it is so absorbant. My bunny however just likes to through it around. No offence he does that no matter what it is. Hwill sit in his toilet for hours that has this litter in it. He doesn't even want to come out of the cage. Thank you
2,would not recommend for iguanas,"I would not recommend for an iguana even though it says safe to use, my friends iguana died from this stuff :("
5,Love will buy again,"Surprised it holds so much in the bag that it comes in. I had a 10 gallon tank and with this i changed the bedding every week for about a month then I got a 50 gallon and I still had enough for that tank.Holds odors really well,My hamster loves to burrow through itit keeps them dry from urinehelps when your house is cold they stay nice and warm with this."
2,It's NOT what's pictured!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The one that was sent to me is RED and NOT black/grey!This doesn't match my kit.On top of that, the trigger doesn't sit level to the head/rim.Garbage."
4,D509S Excellent Bang For The Bucks,"I've had this receiver for about 2 weeks and I love it. I purchased it because it had 3 digital inputs, Dolby Digital and DTS, and the S-video inputs/outputs. I'm running a matched set of JBL speakers/powered subwoofer and the sound is fantastic. It would have gotten five stars if it were more intuitive operationally and had a better manual. Other than that, once you get it setup and running, sit back and enjoy!"
1,Disappointed,"This is the second Pioneer receiver I have owned. The sound that comes out of them is great. I really enjoy watching movies and listening to music with this receiver. Now the problem that I have is ""OVERLOADING"" it just started to do this in the past month. No one knows why. It is not even in the troubleshooting guide of the manual. Now I would not think much of this except for the last receiver I had also had problems and would cost more to fix than buy a new one. So I have come up with a solution.....do not buy pioneer, I think that should solve all my problems."
2,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this receiver and Pioneer customer service. The receiver did not provide enough power to listen to both ""a"" and ""b"" speaker systems. I sent an e-mail to Pioneer only to get a standard reply ""We will be in touch"". I finallycalled and talked to a customer service rep who said ""if you don't like it bring it back"" I bought a Yamaha and everything is fine."
2,Don't Buy This!,"Illustrations are omitted! $6 for an incomplete article is a rip-off!I had found the text freely listed elsewhere on the web, but bought from it Amazon in hopes of obtaining the illustrations, but got the same thing seen elsewhere."
1,Too Small,"Really, charging this price for this poster? I could have taken a photo and paid a few pennies to develop into a larger poster."
4,Johnny Coles,"The recording gives one to hear Coles as a leader. Before this, I onlyheard him in a supporting role, but I liked the way he played. Itwould be nice if more recordings of J. Coles as a leader were available."
3,Pero is OK But?,Not any of these roducts can relace POSTUM. I doctor up 1 heaping t. of Pero with a level t. of raw sugar and 1/2 t. of instant decaf into a mug and fill with boiling water. It now tastes like something that I consider OK to drink each morning. Buy the Pero 6 pack so you can benefit from Amazons free shipment.
2,Odd bitter taste; not like Postum.,"If you are looking for a substitute for the discontinued Kraft hot drink mix Postum, Pero doesn't taste much like Postum. Postum had a much smoother, slightly sweet taste. Pero has bitter flavor, that to me tastes like stale coffee. If you are a coffee drinker and want to cut down on caffeine, a good brand of decaf coffee tastes much better than Pero.By the way, Postum was made from from wheat bran, wheat, molasses, and maltodextrin made from corn. The ingredients of Pero are malted barley, barley, and chicory; so it is quite different."
2,do all of these give you gas???,I really have used Roma but I notice the worst and smelliest gas ever after drinking this stuff has anyone else experienced this??
1,for the more-holistic-than-thou crowd,"If you don't care what it tastes like, but want to maintain your image, this is the thing! And, given the placebo effect (35% of people with some ailments report feeling better with a placebo), and the human tendency for some to like new stuff just because it is new, then Pero may even taste okay to some. Definitely burnishes your credentials as someone who cares enough to go their own way, and demand that others indulge you. If you are going to be a houseguest, you can test your host's inclination toward compliance by stating in advance, ""I cannot drink coffee or tea, but I must have my Pero in the morning"". If said host has Pero on his shelf when you arrive, then the sky's the limit, trample all over this person. Delicately, of course."
5,Pero,I didn't realize that Pero had malt in it and can't drink it because I am Gluten free. Do you accept returns of unopened cases? I still have 5 unopened of a case of 6.Thank you Glenda Clapson
1,pero instant natural beverage,I'm sorry I purchased 6 cannisters of this awful product because I cannot use it.
5,A Bargain and it tastes great!,"This product has a very pleasing flavor. I like mine with milk and sugar and it is a wonderful morning drink. Because it has no caffeine in it, I can drink it any time day or night and not be bothered with jangling nerves and sleeplessness!The price for the 6 cannisters is very reasonable as they last quite a long while. Good value."
4,Pero Fans,"My wife and I use Pero as a coffee replacement. It is not exactly the same, but it is close enough. My wife mixes her's with ""caffeine free"" Cappuccino(Caffe D'vita Irish cream}to form a drink she enjoys very much. We have been drinking it for years and are very pleased with it."
4,pero review,The product is very good. I received it in very quick time and when I realized I needed to change something for the next shipment it was easily changed. This is an excellent replacement for coffee.
5,Pero -Caffeine-Free Dream,This product is terrific - I was in major coffee withdrawal (after an MD ordered coffee quarantine) until I found this product. I now have the satisfaction of a truly coffee-like beverage without the caffeine and its related problems. I have already recommended it to all my friends and give them a sample cup - 9 out of 10 have liked the product.
4,"good product, good price","I have use this product for about 5 years. It is hard to find. Whole Foods stocks it, but this is about a dollar per can cheaper. Since Postum is no longer sold, this is about the only good grain drink that does not contain an coffee."
5,Pero,"I have been drinking Pero for more than 20 years. It has a good flavor, doesn't keep me awake at night and it helps me relax."
3,It's not Postum..Kraft screwed up.,Not bad but it's not Postum. Wish Kraft would bring back Postum. Kraft really screwed up.
3,I'm getting used to it...,"Pero cannot compare to the complex, stimulating flavor of freshly brewed coffee. But, having cut back on coffee, I am learning to enjoy it as a substitute.When I first opened the canister I was hit with an aroma reminiscent of stale instant coffee. Unfortunately, my first taste of it only reinforced that impression. I've never been a fan of instant coffee, so I was initially underwhelmed. However, I decided to give myself a little time to get used to it. Now I can say that, as a healthful, alternative beverage, I actually look forward to a cup.It has a body and mouth feel somewhat reminiscent of coffee, and tastes enough like coffee that it helps satisfy my coffee craving. Even though I always take my coffee black, I add some milk to Pero which gives a little more smoothness and richness to the flavor."
5,Excellent Product,"My father drank Postum for 50 years or more and when they removed it from the market, he was very upset. We immediately began a search of other similar products and finally settled on Pero. It's an excellent hot non-caffine beverage that he truly enjoys."
4,"tastes good, replaced postum for me.","my postum supply finally ran out. i tried pero and liked it. it tastes a only slightly different that postum did, and favorably in my opinion.its basically the same drink as postum. pero has chicory which postum didnt. the chicory is adds a barely detectable bitter taste, which makes flavor remind me of coffee. (which i cant drink anymore.) overall i was pleasantly surprised by Pero."
5,Great warm beverage alternative,"I've never been a coffee drinker, so I can't speak to Pero's comparison to coffee. However, when I want a rich, warm drink with fewer calories, Pero is the choice to beat hot chocolate. I add some non dairy creamer or milk, and just a bit of honey, and it really hits the spot without the overly sweet and high calorie count of hot chocolate. Hard to find in stores now, and Amazon's price is good (especially with Amazon Prime!)."
3,"product great, Amazon shipping, not so great","I like this product, but I lost 2 containers out of 6 because of shipping. They broke open. I requested a refund for my loss through shipping feedback, but no response from Amazon. I am usually so happy with everything I get from Amazon."
2,"Product was great, but the packaging is a mess",Box was crushed on one corner such that one of the cannisters was broken open and there was fine powder everywhere.
1,Love Coffee,If you are a true coffee lover it's going to be hard to switch over. Adding cream made it taste like hot chocolate.
2,Missing Postum,"If you are looking for a Postum substitute, you will be dissapointed. It tastes nothing like Postum. I don't drink coffee so I can't rate it as a coffee substitute."
4,Pero a caffeine substitute,"Pero Instant Natural Beverage, 7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)Pero Instant Beverage:I purchased Pero Instant Beverage to replace caffeine drinks; because I like a warm drink especially in cold weather, but I had too much of a love of and over did coffee. Pero come the closes I have found the coffee taste, but did not give me the jitters. As for taste it is far from coffee but the closest I have found and not a bad substitute. In fact I have learned to like it."
5,Fertile Prayers,"After 38 childless years (by choice) motherhoood was a jolt to my system. My two kids have taken over my life - completely! There are women out there who want kids after 40? I looked at my ""childless"" friends with envy. After Charlotte shared her book with me I realized how mistaken I had been. Days I take for granted like Mother's Day or Father's Day are sad days for my friend. Open House at my kids school, Parent's Tea, Parent's Night (when report cards are given out) can be (at times) a pain in the neck. Charlotte (and others in her position) would welcome and celebrate such events. Fertile Prayers offers hope, guidance and strength to the many ""out there"" in pain."
5,High Octane Entertaining with Feud!,"This guy is a blast! Not one to be turned on with entertainment gourmet TV types, this guy is exceptional. Tuning him in on FoodNetwork several times and really enjoying him and his creativity approach and the fun he has with food and serving it takes me back to my inspiration to enter gourmet --- Galloping Gourmet.Galloping to Surreal -- this is great wealth of inspiration! Recipes and music and suggestions and great photos and the adventure club and alternatives --- it all makes for one rockin' cookin' adventure.Check out the likes of ""Champagne Rissoto"" or ""lobstercapecodstyle"".Try and you'll go back for more, forsurereal!"
2,Sooooo disappointing...,"After buying the Surreal Gourmet's bookSurreal Gourmet Bites: Showstoppers and Conversation StartersI thought this was a shoe-in. But the food just wasn't anything spectacular, and the book felt very dated. (Not sure when it was published - but this one isn't timeless)I absolutely LOVED his Showstoppers and Conversation starters book because the recipes were so unusual, but absolutely delicious and backed up with amazing presentation ideas.This book just didn't have the same feel at all, was boring, and not one that I will probably ever refer to again."
3,College Garage Band Sound,"I saw the Dismemberment Band with Blonde Redhead a few weeks ago when they came to my area. . .Their sound has matured quite a bit since this CD was released. This CD has a lot of random, not well put-together musicians with an almost-there slow punk sound and a lyricist whose voice sounds a lot like Counting Crows' Adam Durwitz, but whose stylings are much different. They sound like a bunch of college frat boys who jam together for the sake of jamming with lyrics as mature (or not) as their music. For a better sample of their stuff, try their newer music."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"It must have been an act of Satan for a major record label to sign a band which produces such unlistenable, grating noise. This band manages to perfect a sound that brings to mind They Might Be Giants pumped through a turkey call. Do not be fooled by the reviews of band members and girlfriends! The Dismemberment Plan is Terrible."
4,Discover them today or you'll be kicking yourself tomorrow,"Great music by some great fellows. Both quirky and catchy the songs stick in your head like jingle...a very disturbing, polyrhythmic jingle for a product probably not suitable for children. However, to get the full effect, one must see them live. The album doesn't capture the full intensity and insanity these boys produce on stage. Still, buy the album so when you see them you can sing along."
4,slept like a baby,"This was purchased for my Grandma trip to babysit my grandson . I loved that I did not have to crawl off the floor and that the bed was easy to get in and out of. I spent little time tossing and turning and went to sleep easily. I have purchased many aero beds in the past and this is by far my favorite. It is very stable and like a real bed......my grandson loved taking naps on the bed and slept in it when I left....AERO Premier Raised Air Bed, Twin Size 49811"
4,AERO Premier Air Bed,"I am pleased with the AERO Premier Air Bed...compared to our previous air beds, the AERO is closer to being a 'real' bed, and so handy when our Grandson visits. Sitting high off the floor was an important feature for me as well as the ease of pumping air in and deflating; hardly any work for us humans here."
5,You Can Have Your Dream!,"What a wonderful, uplifting book! I admit to being a little bit prejudiced--I've known Paul and Sarah for some time and have always admired how consistently positive they are and how joyfully they create their lives. If you want practical, down-to-earth information about how you, too, can live your dream, you've come to the right people with the right book. They show you how to transform your dreams into reality simply and economically. They don't just preach it--they live it. Their story of their move from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles to the forest hills of Pine Mountain is wonderfully inspiring. They share how to find the time, find the money, and find the will to ""just do it."" Don't wait one more day to get started on your dream. It's haveable. This book will become your trusted friend and guide along the way."
1,Too Vague and New Age-Y,"This book does talk about dreams, all right - too much. Oddly enough, all I've ever found in it was talk about (insert New Age-y accent here) ""finding your DREEEEEEAM!!!"", and very little ""practical"" advice on how to make your dream a reality, once you find it. And I've read it twice, just to see if my first impression was correct. The authors also talk too much about finding their own dream. It's great when authors relate their own stories in a book, so you know they've experienced what you're experiencing. But it got to where if I read one more word about them buying their home in Pine Mountain, I was going to scream. I've read other books of theirs, and I just have to conclude that their books simply aren't for me. Great if they work for other people, but I need more actual, practical advice."
4,the practical dreamer's Handbook,"I have been reading this book for a month, I first got it at the library, but there was some much good information, I had to buy it. I haven't finished it yet-- reading 5 others books, but what I have read is very good."
4,Pretty good!,"Apple Creek dulcimers (a.k.a. ""Blue Moon"" dulcimers) are a real hit-or-miss affair. Some work quite well, while others are almost unplayable. (I learned this after I ordered it but before it arrived.) Mine happens to work quite well.This is definitely a ""student"" model, but I'm happy with it for what it is.Research your dulcimer before you buy it! [...]"
1,Such a disappointment,We had enjoyed playing one our grand dad made and were surprised by how easy it was to learn. This model is useless. The neck is too short to get any recognizable strums /notes out. Might as well have bought a $15 non-playable kids' store model. Wish we had put this $70 towards one that you can actually play a song on. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY.
3,Some info on this item,"I bought this dulcimer as well. I dont really play string instruments but I love the way a dulcimer sounds and thought it would be one of the easiest string instruments for me to learn as for all intents and purposes the dulcimer has 3 strings ( this one has 4 but 2 of them are melody strings which produce the same note ) This is NOT a 6 1/2! It is a plain old dulcimer. If you are unclear on what this means, it means: each string can not range a full octave. Which is fine if you are playing a lot of folk music, kids songs and older songs. However if you are needing to make chords for playing pop music this dulcimer is not for you. If you are just learning to play and you know you can resell it for a good price and buy a better one later if you like it, then this dulcimer IS for you. and yes I do agree some of the parts are shoddy, but for learning to play this instrument and not using it to perform its just fine."
2,Not recommended,"Assembled in Romania using commodity plywood and cheap Chinese tuners, this is an instrument to avoid -- ESPECIALLY if you're likely to develop an affinity for the dulcimer.While the open strings will tune properly, chords will sound terrible thanks to the assembly-line luthiership. The shoddy nut and bridge, combined with automated fretwork, is a nightmare.Yes, it is cheap, but beginners will not be able to advance very far, and those with any experience with string instrument will draw the wrong conclusions about dulcimers.If you are really on a budget and are unsure about dulcimers, even a cardboard --- yes cardboard -- dulcimer is superior to this one. A good cardboard dulcimer is about the same price.But if you can spend even $125, you can find nicely crafted student dulcimers from a variety of American luthiers."
3,"Okay, but Way Dated now...","It was good at the time, but now it is pretty dated, wouldn't recommend it for current VMware users. Unfortunate, because I don't think there's a comparable good VMware book out there now."
2,Jeffrey Dahlmer here we come,This game turned my stomach- I don't think kids need that visual impact of a coroner's job.
5,Very effective!,"I love the Medi-beads products, and highly recommend them. Although not as comfortable as the pliable elasto-gel, I love the moist heat and the weight of the pads. I used them therapeutically both for myself and for massage therapy clients. I only wish they made a longer one to cover the entire back, but 2 of the king-sized pads will do it. Microwave time will vary according to the power of your microwave."
4,Works well and retains heat longer than others,"I like the fact that this unit retains warmth as long as it does. It doesn't take more than 90 seconds in the microwave to activate it. I also have another of their products that is far more versatile.I would recommend the MediBeads Therapy Wrap with the straps over this product as it's easier to position it and to keep it in place. You can even walk around with it tied on. This product covers a larger area which is why I got it. However, it isn't that much bigger and isn't as wide or doesn't seem to be. They are both well made and superior to other products that work in the same manner."
5,Wonderful!,"My husband bought this for me when I was achy and sore while recovering from surgery. The pad works beautifully! It helps relieve the knots and tension without feeling too heavy or awkward. It also retains heat well. Depending on where I place it, I dont feel the need to reheat it until a half hour to an hour has passed. It was also a lifesaver; our heat went out recently due to the cold. Our microwave was the only source of heat in sub-freezing temperatures. Sleeping with the heating pad helped keep us comfortably warm. We will be buying another pad in the near future."
5,Perfect for aches and pains,I had a product similar to this I puchased years ago. It finally wore out. My husband and I looked everywhere in stores for a replacement. No one had any. Amazaon had this one. We ordered it and it is just what we wanted. Really soothing for all those aches and pains. We are thankful to finally find one.
3,nice color but fades fast,"i love special effects! i have burgundy wine, blue mayhem, and blue velvet. those colors stay for me for at least a month before they look gross and hay like (i have black hair with streaks that have been bleached to platinum blond. i just color the blond parts. and i wash my hair every day). however, candy apple red stays for about a week. maybe 10 days.... i dunno why. maybe the blue pigments stay better. so i wouldn't blame the brand or anything. just something to think about if you're lazy and don't want to color all the time like me! i'd rather get a darker color like burgundy wine which is my FAVE and then let it fade to the reddish pink"
1,"This is the same video as Vol 3 ""Dance'n the Day Away""","One of the first Bear Videos I bought was Vol 3 and my 1 year old twin girls loved it. So I was excited about getting another one that had to do with dancing. Unfortunately when I popped it in the VCR the first episode was the same as the first episode of Vol 3. I was disappointed but thought, well as long as they have a different 2nd episode, I would be happy. Then the 2nd episode came out and I couldn't believe it. It was the same from start to finish. So I took it out of the VCR and looked at it closly and it was called Vol 3 also. Same video, two different cases. Now I'm stuck with 2 videos that are exactly the same. ... Either somehow the manufacturer put the wrong video in or they aren't paying attention to what they are putting out."
5,Love,"Bear in The Big Blue House is amazing. Both kids and adults enjoy it. I got this for my neice for Christmas, and she loves it. Thank you!"
3,Authentic mariachi,"Very good mariachi cd. Excellent musicians and good vocalists. This is a very good compilation of Mexican music, however I would have liked more mariachi traditionals."
5,Small Miracles of Love and Friendship...FABULOUS!,"This book warmed my heart; made me cry in a public place; made me cry when I tried to re-tell the stories. Basically, this collection of true stories released the human spirit within me, and within all of those I forced to listen to me. I would recommend this book to anyone who is unafraid to feel and willing to open up to love. As my title says: FABULOUS!Keep writing those books, ladies!Cathy Fitzgerald"
5,Splendid W.F. Bach cantatas,"This DVD is a revelation; that W.F. Bach was a talented (if not very prolific) composer is not new, but the quality of these cantatas is, in my opinion, right up there with the best of his father's. Add to this the fine singing, both choral and solo, the excellent instrumental playing, the beautiful church setting and acoustics, and top-notch camera work, and I would not hesitate to deem this one of the best DVDs of church cantatas I know of. W.F. Bach's music is filled with thrilling counterpoint in the choral movements, and some of the arias, especially the slower ones, are truly beautiful. W.F.'s difficult instrumental writing is handled with aplomb, with dangerous horn and trumpet parts (on baroque instruments) played with verve. These cantatas also feature lovely flute and violin obbligato parts, and the bass player is especially put to the test (and passes with flying colors). Highly recommended!"
5,Best Christmas Gift Ever!,"The above is a direct quote from my 9 yr old Grand son when he opened this. First, it was suddenly ""legal"" for him to make a mess, then he loved the idea that he could make whatever he wanted, and finally, he could ""show it to my grandkids""... Poor kid... doesn't have a clue! But we all loved the excitement he got from watching him open it, to him deciding what he could make with it, and knowing that it would be a lasting tribute to him... whether he wanted it to be or not!"
2,i thought it would be better,The dvd seemed to be of poor quality especially for the price. The documentary also was not what i expected. It left me with alot of questions unaswered..I would not recommend it.
2,Disappointed,As a very great fan of the Honeymooners while growing up I was very disappointed in watching them in 2010. Our taste in humor is so much more sophisticated now that the episodes just seemed so very silly and dumb. We couldn't even finish watching the DVD. Sometimes memories are best left alone and this to me is one such case.
3,Short Changed,"There were actually 2 different Christmas themed Honeymooners Reunion shows, each appeared in the late '70's. Why in the world couldn't both of the Christmas Reunion specials be included on this one DVD?? Don't tell me we have to wait till next year to pay another $15 to get the remaining Christmas Honeymooner Reunion special? I smell the scent of greed in the air. Come on 2 48 minute Christmas specials on one DVD release can't be asking too much."
3,Not Much Of Either,"There isn't much Christmas to this Christmas special, and it isn't all that special either. Special only, I suppose, in being the last Gleason Honeymooners show. There's a reference to Christmas at the start, but the pretense of Ralph amassing money for one of his schemes could come from anything and the holiday is not integral to the scheme or 99% of the show at all.As others have posted, it then becomes double-frustrating when you know there was a REAL Christmas-themed Honeymooners Reunion show the year before. And, of the four 1976-1977 reunion shows, it is the only one not released, and could have clearly been included with this one."
5,Jackie Gleason the Honeymooners,We are big fans of Jackie Gleason had to get this one just to see what he was up to for the Holidays. It was funny not disappointed at all.
1,WOW - somebody has a screw loose...,"Let's see, ""Brother Russell"" calls Ted a ""hate filled homophobe"", yet he is the one who has targeted Christians for their beliefs with his twisted venom. I guess ""tolerance"" is selective for Brother Russell...When someone dislikes a particular group to the extent that they make a CD (and I guess some sort of a pathetic career) out of prank phone calls, then you know that person is unbalanced and obsessed. If you despise Christians in the name of ""tolerance"", and share and unnatural hatred of someone whose faith you do not share, by all means purchase this CD. I think you would be better off however with some quiet introspection as to why you would harbor such intense feelings.I have found most people who harbor this type of venom towards Christianity either have a sin issue or a fear that Christians are right and someday they will have to face God and account for themselves."
2,"5 stars for story, 1 star for senseless edits","I love Daria and this movie was a very fitting sign off for the series. However, for some unknown reason, MTV found reason to make numerous small cuts throughout the movie from the original version as it appeared in its original broadcast. Jokes are deleted, natural conversations between characters are reduced to ""just the facts, Ma'am."" At least one scene, in which Daria decides not to go on a date with Tom in favor of staying home, was totally cut out of the movie. ???The original soundtrack was also replaced with a generic music backdrop to avoid obtaining video distribution rights for the original music.I recommend buying the DVD if you have no other way to see the broadcast version. I just hope that someday MTV will someday see fit release it uncensored, as well as complete unedited season releases. (Noggin edits episodes for content)."
3,Get it if you loved the show,"The 1st movie, 'Is it Fall Yet?', had the OK To Cry Corral, Quinn getting tutored, and a bunch of well written, funny scenes, whereas 'Is It College Yet?' seems pretty uninspired -- which is to say funny, but not _very_ funny, and without suprises or new 'takes' on the characters. It is, of course, nice to see things wrapped up, which is the whole point of this movie.Basically, I thought this movie would be really, really fun, but it wasn't really, really fun; it was _OK_."
5,This DVD is for any person obsessed with Daria,"I just started becoming a Daria fan, and I loved this DVD even though I didn't know much of the characters yet. Even if you haven't seen the show, this is still a great movie. Unfortunately, no new episodes of Daria were made after this movie. Oh well."
5,Daria now it complete.,"It now complete. You need Daira is it College Yet?. Yes, because it good to have it all. Daria the complete series is really incomplete with Daria-Is it college Yet? She tells everybody how she feel. I always feel like the writer and the producer just one to"
1,Ripoff,Same price as the 7.5 ounce -- about 225 ml as opposed to 50. Is this really that concentrated? Concentrated at all? If so why don't they market both in ounces or both in ml?
5,Foam is better than pads,"My doctor recommended an eyelid scrub and gave me some pads, but the foam is better. Many stores do not carry the foam or overprice it, but the CLE price is very competitive.If you clean your fingers carefully then you can use the foam on your finger for the scrub, which is much more comfortable for me than the pads. Generates fewer waste items too (pads or cotton balls or tips)."
2,People of teh Abyss,"I don't know where this book came from, but the publisher is awful. There were so many typos in the book, I couldn't believe it. It looked like a bootlegged copy. disappointing. First time this ever happened with anything I've ever received from Amazon."
4,A very good read.,"This is a well-written series which has, for me, become better over time as they become less light. There are red herrings, suspense and an ending which is sad and touching. Very well done."
3,I'm not sure how I feel about this yet . . .,"I'll probably end up reading the second volume just to confirm my love or hate of this manga. The story itself is an interesting concept and the art is gorgeous (mostly on the cover, chapter pages, and in some cases the background) but in general the characters seem to be drawn with less care than other manga. As for the personalities of the characters, Dinah struck me as a spoiled, stupid little girl who can't do anything for herself except dress up in fashionable gothic Lolita outfits. She relied on her friend Vincent to do everything for her and she actually didn't do much in this volume (it's almost as if Vincent, and not Dinah, was the main character and might I mention that he was entirely loveable). She redeemed herself somewhat in the final pages of this volume but who knows what the next book will bring? Hopefully a continuation of this intriguing story and a way to make me love the main character better."
5,Gentlemen prefer Bizenghast,"This book is amazing. The art is gorgeous. It's drawn in a different style than Japanese manga, but in my opinion, it's an improvement if anything. The backgrounds and costumes are divine, and the entire mood of the story is satisfyingly grim and gorgeous, a perfect mixture of Victorian/gothic horror and current-day humor. There are a few more horrific depictions on the lines of a Jhonen Vasquez novel (think Invader Zim or Johnny the Homicidal Maniac), but they are rare enough that it adds to the appeal of the comic without making the work excessively gory. Bizenghast is a credit to the American graphic novel industry."
2,Decent.,"The story is a bit on the dark side and is kind of hard to follow as you get deeper into the series.I'd suggest it if you didn't have anything better to read, or if you're curious, but don't expect anything too great.The saving part of the series may just be the fantastic artwork."
4,"Stunning Visually, Interesting Plot","Bizengahst is a manga series written by M. Alice LeGrow, or ""Marty"" as her internet persona is called. Bizengahst is filled to the brim with beautiful artwork. It breaks aways from the typical manga/anime artwork that people come to expect from a manga. Its refreshing to see such fresh artwork. Each page is detailed beautifully with art that is reminiscent of Victorian age art, with an Asian twist. Plus everything the female lead is wearing, is to die for!The storyline is filled with unforgeable characters, and a horror-esque plot. Its filled with ghosts and things that go bump in the night. However I must point out that the suppose mental problems Dinah had weren't refenced enough in the book, but regardless its still a thrilling read that keeps me wanting more."
1,Very Disappointing!,"As a long time fan of Patricia Grasso's books, I was very disappointed with this one. The most interesting part of this book is the title. The book itself was, in a word, ""stupid"" (if you have read or do read this book you'll know what I mean by using this particular word). The characters were unlikable, even those from previous books that were fun and interesting, became very unlikable and unsympathetic in this book. It lacks the charm, warmth and wit of her older books. I have all of her books, and re-read them as time goes by. I doubt that I'll keep this one in my collection, it would just take up space."
2,Not very good!,"Ah...this could have been great. A heroine with a learning disability is uncommon in an historical romance. I realize Victoria was treated as an immature girl partially due to her disabiliy and partially due to the ignorance of all those around her who thought she was lacking. She was thought mature enough to marry, but treated as an immature, spoiled child. She was thought mature enough to be betrothed, but not mature enough to be told. Too inconsistant! Alex treated her poorly and I couldn't stand him as the hero. What's with the threatened spankings? Even in historical books, I find them too much. What's with the ingnorance to his sister's and her friend's evil? He was intelligent, yet ignorant to their plans? Unrealistic! The reason I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1 is that the courtroom chapter and the last chapter are redeemed it somewhat. The courtroom chapter is especially good."
1,One stars to much,"I enjoy Patricia Grasso, but this was a dismal failure. The heroine, or in my opinion the whipping post, of the story had no redeemable qualities at all. She let everyone and everything walks all over her, and then she thanked them for it. She is supposed to have dyslexia but it seemed like her real problem was a complete lack of both intelligence and maturity. Who in their right mind would let someone this ill prepared marry? I kept waiting for the scene where she stands up for herself or someone in her family does. It never came. The only thing this book was good for was a lesson in frustration and what not to read."
2,Looks can be deceiving...,"These are much SMALLER than I had anticipated. Though I read the description, I never expected the candles to be the size of a thimble! (Literally.) The stakes look great in various pots and planters on my patio, but I was hoping for some to go AROUND the patio...also, there is no way to put new candles in the holders or refill them. They are a little expensive for 2 1/2 hours buring time (they didn't last through the appetizers at my party)."
3,Too small!,"I was searching for a cotton bra to do light activity (working out, just wearing around the house, sleeping, etc.) so I decided to buy this one.The bra is very comfortable, stretchy and supports well but it runs small. The wide band at the bottom of the bra also folds up sometimes.I am a small C cup and ordered a large (usually wear size medium) and this was still a little too small. The cups are made small...I do not think the extra large would be much better.I recommended this for people who are B cups and smaller. The bra does flatten quite a bit as the other reviewer said."
3,Runs very small!,i'm a 32 A and really don't need to wear a bra- but i do need an undergarment to keep myself from looking too obscene in t-shirts! i like the bra- but it runs so small! i wear a size 0 to 2 - and the small feels like it's made for a child. I wore it tonight and kept complaining that i thought my head was going to pop off because the bra was constricting the blood flow through my chest and neck! i would buy this bra again- but in a larger size. my advice- before you purchase any of the calvin klein 365 bras- go try them on first. i was looking at the entire line at macy's- and they all seem to run very small.
4,High on Comfort,"I find this bra to be extremely comfortable and it's rare I find one I can say that about. I gave it four stars because it flattens me a bit and since I just make it to a B cup I don't like that effect in certain clothes. However, I bought two and use them frequently. Could be used for a light to medium activity sports bra."
1,Calvin Klein Shaper,I was never more insulted!! The product was listed for $32.00. When I received it the price tag on the item was $26.00. I returned it without ever taking it out of the packagingCalvin Klein Women's 365 Cotton Seamless Shaper Bra #D1301
3,How-to-play baseball for the child reader.,"This book is best for nine to eleven year olds who are interested enough to read about baseball. Kasoff tells the reader how to play each position, how to hit, how to pitch, etc., in clear prose. He also tacks on some baseball trivia at the end of each chapter in an attempt to interest his youthful readers in baseball history. My ten year old liked the trivia. The problem I have with the book is that here and there the playing tips are perhaps a little dated. However, this book teaches more good fundamentals than 90% of the Little League coaches out there, so it's valuable for the child who has to learn it for him-or herself."
1,Very Disappointed,"After reading the reviews, I was very excited for this book. At last a book to help me form notes to my parents. But I was very disappointed. It included notes in it about ADD, learning disabilities, being popular, drugs etc. Besides being in poor taste, many of these notes would be illegal for a teacher to send home. The only thing I got out of this book was laughter at how ridiculous it was. Please don't waste your money on this."
5,Italian Now Is Genius!,"I am 11 years old and I wanted to teach myself Italian. This is a great book for beginners! At first there is a conversazione (conversation)in Italian with English reference. After the dialog you study your vocabulary and answer questions, which to my pleasure, I found exciting! This is also a good book for people traveling to Italy. Heres why: Not only do you learn the language, you learn the Italian culture! Ex: ""A friend that you haven't seen in a while is usually greeted with a small kiss on the cheek, and a pat on the back."" This a fast book to get through, especially if you are taking other programs along with it. I highly recommend this workbook!"
4,Italinan Now! A Level One Worktext,Going to a class and it follows the book. Easy to understand - I'm glad I bought it. Might buy Level Two soon.
4,A helper,"I have a cd for the language, Italian.Combined with this book (Italian now)it makes both very easy to comprehend.."
1,I piece of drivel,"My wife and I have been traveling to Italy almost every year and decided that it might be useful to learn some Italian. After taking a class at a community college we decided to buy Italian Now. This is the worse language book we have ever encountered. It is an endless advertisement for Dr. Primsler who is a moron and a fraud. He does not understand that every person has his or her way of memorizing, adjusted to his or her ability and he assumes that everyone needs to hear a word twenty times in a row to remember it. This is all there is to his method. The result is that you spend half an hour learning well almost nothing. Don't buy this book. Any other book we have seen is better."
1,Italian,Don't like the way the topics are presented. It's confusing and it doesn't have structure. Not recommending it for self learning and neither for teachers.
3,It looked like a good jack but not good for all SUV's,I'm sure this jack can lift a 12 ton car but it just won't fit all SUV's or trucks properly therefore using it won't be as easy as you may think. I can lift my wife's Acura MDX with ease but it doesn't fit the slots for my Toyota 4Runner and setting it to some odd spot just not a very good idea. Its good i don't have to do it too often.Check your specific car before buying it.
5,Favorite Treat,"My Boston Terrier LOVES these. He can be asleep in the upstairs bedroom and come running if he even hears me even touch the bag! They are smelly, but totally worth it because he loves them so much. He is normally picky about treats because he is so spoiled, and I make him so many homemade ones (milkbones? he won't put the things in his mouth), but he cannot get enough of these. It is a plus that they are made in America and healthier for him than other treats. My boyfriends family also has two Dachshunds and they go insane over these as well. Also, my roommate's Shihpoo goes crazy when he smells them."
5,nice jerky treats,"I picked these up since I was out of lakse kronch treats. honestly I think my dogs preffer these to the Lakse Kronch treats; they seem to like jerky treats better than the crunchy kind. since I can pick these up locally and not have to order them from amazon I will probably stick w/ these. they also make a couple of different kinds (duck, chicken, kangaroo) and I can't wait to try them."
4,good,"My dog loves these products very much, it is smelly, but it must taste good. It tastes like real fish skin."
5,Excellent dog treat product,Excellent dog treat product... can be easily broken in half if a smaller treat is desired. Strong fish smell.. and dogs almost stand on their heads for this smell!
3,A great idea !!,"This is a small bean bag type stuffed animal with a personality. I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday. Each webkinz comes with a year's subscription to their website where you care for your new ""adoption"". It's a great way for my daughter and I to have some down time before bed."
1,shipping rates,"Some of the prices are low it seems to attract customers, but for one small animal is 12.50 for shipping for EACH one, even if you buy 4 of them, my subtotal was around 20.00 and shipping was 65.00 for just 4 animals. As a fellow seller, I still find this ludicrous, it is one thing to price your items at a higher rate, but as for shooting the shipping price up like that is ridiculous. NO way is it gonna cost 65.00 to ship a quantity of products that is less than 5 lbs. If you elect to buy these products, make sure each one is shipped separately so you atleast get your moneys worth, I suppose."
1,Isn't what I expected!,This is the arcade version (Old Version). This game doesn't add any especial when played in the Playstation Systems.
4,The '24-Bit' system..,"Snk-Playmore seems to be one of the last companies to be releasing these old-school compilations. I'm personally glad that they are archiving the legendary Neo-Geo collection thru these releases.Personally, I've never been a big fan of the Art of Fighting series. Just couldn't really get into it like some other fighting games; however, I still enjoyed it from time to time.This compilation is a no-frills ""direct to video"" port from the Neo-Geo. You get all three original AOF games without any touch-ups or additions. Some might berate this tactic, but I don't mind it 'au natural'.You get three original Neo-Geo fighters, that went for about $200 each back in the day; now for around $10 or less. Don't like 2D sprite-based fighters? Then go look elsewhere. Otherwise, you've come to the right place for some SNK nostalgia."
4,4 Stars!,"i used to play this on the arcade. now, i own the game over my PS2! this is a great game! classic!"
4,Game review,The game is great. Fighting style is similar to the Street Fighter II games. The game is very fun to play.
3,the art of fighting,"it was fun for a while, but pretty outdated when compared to tekken or soul calibur."
5,A great continuation & I hope the next'll be avail soon!,"I am not a huge fan of ST books, for the most part. They rarely tell me anything about the series I don't already know. This New Frontier series is a different kettle of fish. I think they're great & get each one as soon as it comes out. (I've taken to buying David's other books as well, about B5, and his own stuff too._Howling Mad_ is on my too-read list.) With these he tells funny, romantic, exciting, political stories, that differ a great deal from OS or TNG type ships. Mackenzie Calhoun is a different man than the Starfleet captains we've seen. His universe, his ship, is more fun too. But as much as possible these books should be read in order. I eagerly await #9 and all the other NF books to come. (Don't forget the Captain's Table book about Calhoun also by David, _Once Burned,_ you NF fans.)"
4,Uggh! What a Cliffhanger!,"This was another great book in the NF series. After the suprisingly so-so Quiet Place, Dark Allies gives us more of the Excalibur Crew and evolution of the multiple sub plots running. Be warned though that to read both #7 and #8, new readers should pick up Once Burned and Double or Nothing if they want to catch some of the inside jokes.UGGHHH! This was a great book, but i can't stand the cliffhanger!"
5,Please Don't Make us Wait for No.9,"I've read this series from the beginning and this book has been the most enjoyable. This eklectic cast of characters are both serious, talented and humerous at the same time. Too bad they haven't made ""New Frontier"" series into a new Star Trek television series. It's the closest yet to the original series, yet different enough to hold your attention. Let's hope we don't have to wait too long for #9 & #10."
3,Could Have Been Great.,"This book was way too short. I believe a Star Trek movie or novel is not complete without majestic scenes of space battles with energy beams flashing through the starry darkness, torpedoes hurtling into oblivion against enemy shields, and starships dying in majestic explosions. This book also has too much hand to hand combat. In the 24th century, with technology so advanced, there should be almost no room for hand to hand combat. They should be the exception, not the rule. On the other hand, this book was very entertaining. I was pleased to finally meet Kalinda without the effects of those alien hormones her ""mother"" gave her. I loved the way Captain Calhoun handled the problem of the Redeemer high priest on that hostage planet of a pre-warp civilization. If you're a fan of the New Frontier series like me, you wouldn't want to miss this latest installment."
3,"So-so, but still a good addition to the series","It was a good book, full of twists and funniness. But . . . (you knew it was coming) some of the scenes were unnecessary and didn't contribute to the series at all. Like Morgan and Robin suffering a cold, I really thought there was a cure for the common cold, or at least there would be some ways to stop the disease in the first place (such as transporter biofilter) so it was ridiculous. Also, the scenes between Xyon, Reilla, and Si Cwan were humorous, though very predictable and a very overused cliche of brother protecting sister while sister want to be with another boy."
5,Fantastic,"A totally fun, exciting and hilarious read. An all-out riot. Great characters and action, as well as plenty of inside jokes, like Burgoyne fighting the 'Purple People Eater'. I'd have to say that Peter David has done a great job with the New Frontier series. They are honestly some of the best Trek books I've read in a long time."
3,Like sucking molasses through a straw,"I've read a lot of animation books over the years, but this is one I don't think I'll ever look at again. Most of these ""one stop shop"" type books that cover every single aspect of filmmaking end up not saying much no matter how long winded they are.There's no shortage of information in this book. The problem is little, if any of it is in a form you can be readily applied to your own work. Complex thoughts with little elaboration. Highly visual ideas with no pictures explain things. Just a glut of film making tibits with little actual learning.The CD content is better than ones in some other books I've read, but it doesn't help if the disc takes the place of illustrations in the book. That way I'm forced to be at my computer while I'm reading to get the most out of the book. Overall I think the CD added more to the price of the book than it did the content.For my time and money, books like CGI Filmmaking: The Creation of Ghost Warrior are a much better buy."
4,High quality but too stiff!,"They fit to size, have a good quality but too stiff and you should choose something more comf. If you have sensitive feets."
2,Very stiff leather,These are not as comfortable boat shoes as the other boat shoes I have purchased the leather is very stiff and hard the color is good but they did not soften like other shoes I have got
1,"Very uncomfortable, Don't buy this shoe",I had to return this product as they were very uncomfortable. The insole has a ledge (step-down) between the heel and the ball of the foot. It is about 1/2 an inch difference. I have never seen this in a shoe before and hope I don't ever encounter it again. I called the Docksiders customer service center in hopes that this was just a mistake but they told me that this is the way they are making their shoes. I hope that Docksider's will rethink this idea as I won't be buying any more shoes from them that have this insole.
1,"Horrible, don't buy, but if you're stuck with them, here's help","I've always worn Sebago's and loved their comfort, but these are so stiff and uncomfortable you can't wear them. Going on the assumtion they were a write-off anyway, I starting stomping on them and this helped the leather as well as my mood. Put on a pair of socks, think of Sebago, and squash every part of them. I've been doing this once a day for a month and they have softened up quite a lot."
2,too tight,"I returned these because they were way too tight. I should have gotten a bigger size. I dont like wearing shoes tight, and these were way too tight. I got a 6.5, i should have gotten a 7.5. they were really rough too. I understand that I would have to break them in but still, OUCH!I'm gonna try and find a better brand."
1,Another Costume Less Superhero,"Very disappointed in this movie. Why do modern schmucks feel they have the right to take classic characters and change them beyond recognition? Ever since Tim Burton's Batman most superhero costumes are all black or non-existent, this one is both. How would the new Phantom continue the legend of, ""The Ghost Who Walks"" without the uniform? The concept of the super-powered suit isn't all that bad, the Phantom did add new technology to his arsenal as times changed, but make it look like the Phantom. When the classic suit in the case was revealed I thought, ""COOL"" the new Phantom character ridiculed it. I'll take the Zane version over this junk any day."
4,This was good and can be better as a series.,"This is a relatively decent modern update of the classic serials, and a good followup to Billy Zane's film version. The story has enough twists to keep you guessing, even at the end, and has plenty of potential to be a new series. The quality and scale for this kind of budget was obvious and should be improved if this turns into a series, which it should."
3,'The Phantom' deserves a reboot,"If you remember The Phantom from the days of the Sunday funnies, comic books and the theatre serial, you will probably be sorely disappointed in this made for TV miniseries. This in no way resembles what you remember. The plot is weak, the 'origin' story is totally fabricated as to his individual start. For an original story, it is okay. For affianados of the classic Phantom character, it just doesn't cut the mustard. If you're like me, I figure it is not worth a second look. Don't waste your money."
1,Sorry excuse for a Phantom Film,"I watched this on TV. It deviates so much from Lee Falk's creation that is insulting. The story was just plain poor.The actor that portrays Kit was all wrong. The Phantom is a big, muscular man. This guy is petite!! You need a guy the size of John Cena of WWE to play the Phantom - a real bad ass good guy.The over all acting was not even B movie grade.Lets redo this but go back to the original story."
2,Not a chewable toy,My dog was able to chew pieces off this toy within a couple minutes of receiving it. No where does the manufacturer say that this cannot be used as a chew. I'm tired of spending $$ for toys I have to throw away after a few minutes.
4,Great Tug Toy!,"My dog, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier,is a very strong chewer. He loves playing with his black Kong (the only toy that has lasted for any length of time). The only problem with the Kong is that he loves to play WITH people, and the Kong doesn't really lend itself well to tug-of-war. I found this toy on the ground during one of our daily walks, and my dog immediately fell in love. The rubber is soft on his mouth, and the links make it easy for me to play with him without hurting my shoulder, or having my fingers get accidentally chomped on. I wouldn't recommend leaving a strong chewer alone with it, but for fun interactive play without getting your arm pulled out of the socket, this toy is great!"
2,my dog killed it,"I have a 67 lb. German Pincher and a 78 lb. lab and Shepard mix. Ya it lasted 2 weeks, stick with Kong extreme the black ones and Nylobone."
4,"Nice graphics, just repetitive","I thought that this was a really cool game. The graphics come out at you, but as the game goes on, you keep having to pretty much do the same things over and over again. I stopped playing it b/c I got tired of it. You fight people, run away until you get invisible, then go somewhere else and do it all over again. Great game if you like that kinda stuff."
2,good but no cigar,i found the game to be very dull completing the same objectives over and over again the concept was a good one but the game play is very dull
1,What the hell is this?,"The idea behind this game is great however the execution was a total bomb! The game is soooooooo repetitive that you will want to just be done with the game after the first few missions. It's that bad. You get intel then go assassinate someone over and over and over and over again. I mean, what the hell is that crap? That's not fun. The only good thing this game has going for it is the story, graphics, and all that wall climbing stuff. That is it. This is a sorry excuse for a game."
1,"horribly repetitive, basic button masher","this game is horrible. you dont actually fight anyone or climb anything. youre just mashing up and hitting A and X or whatever. theres no actual thinking or strategy involved. just pretty views and scenes. pushing a button and watching your character do crazy attacks does not satisfy me. i wanna think of how to attack and actually have something to do during the attack, like aim. and not just watch my character do all the work."
1,Not worth the money,This all in all is a terrible game. It is not fun and you only kill about 20 people. You sneak around and listen to peoples conversations. This is probably my least favorite 360 game.
2,Tedious,"Very disappointing. It's the same tedium time and again. The basic game play is boring enough, but it never gets any more interesting and as the game progresses, it simply throws in more beggars and guards who annoyingly trip up the tedious tasks so you end up repeating the same boring sequences again and again.On the plus side, it's one of the most visually appealing games I've seen."
3,Not the RPG it promised,"Good game, but honestly with the reviews and the synopsis I was hoping for a much more customizable character. It's more a decorated first person shooter than a role play. Should be fun for anybody who has the patience for the ridiculous moves and combinations which require memorization."
4,"Good concept, with repetitive execution","Assassin's Creed is a very fun game, but suffers from some very repetitive game play. The game typically works like this: you get a mission, go to an area, are required to find clues to your ultimate target. this is the repetitive portion, as they are basically the same mission, pick pokcet, intimidate, or ease drop. There's a few alternates, but not very many. Once enough clues are found, the real mission begins. These are quite similar to the hitman series, with a few choices of how to kill the target. Each death ends with more story, and then back to get another mission. While I wouldn't call the game great, I would say the game is very good. Despite doing the same thing over and over, I was entertained the entire time. I look forward to playing the sequel, and see if they can diversify the game. In the meantime, this budget priced game is excellent and worth a look. Give it a try."
3,Blah...,"This game was pretty fun at first, but started getting repetitive after a while. The tactics were never really changed up. In order to have a target to assassinate, there are three ways you HAVE to gather info: sit on a bench and overhear two people talking, pick pocket some guy for info, and beat somebody up until they talk. Those are the three same methods you must use EVERYTIME you have to assassinate somebody. After doing this over and over, it becomes a snoozefest.After weeks of having the game, I still haven't beat it. Not because it was hard, but because I just lost interest. I wouldn't recommend anybody to buy this game. If you know a friend that has it, I'd suggest borrowing it or renting it from a video store.The only reason this game gets three stars is because of the very interesting and original storyline."
2,:[,"i was really looking forward to this videogame, i mean what's better than stabbing a guy in the neck? however i found that the game's sound bites were repeatative as well as the gameplay. the pace does not increase as i hoped it would either. it is a solid rental but i would not suggest purchasing it... a shame, the concept and idea good, but very poor execution(if you're shopping around this review will be repeated in some sites)"
2,Too Repetitive,"I loved the visuals for this game. I loved the setting. What I didn't love was the repetition. Every mission was pretty much the same thing with different characters. The action of climbing just to uncover the city maps got boring pretty quick. I finished the game, but if I hadn't heard the repetition problem was corrected in Assassin's Creed 2, I would not have purchased it. That game had a more serious problem so that I won't purchase another Ubisoft product. In the end, I'd say invest your money and your time in another company's games."
5,One of the best games I've ever played,"This game is one of THE BEST I've ever played. The graphics are phenomenal! And gives you HOURS of play time to try and find the flags, etc. You must buy this game because you will not be let down. This is actually the first time I've ever written a review and probably the last because I just had to tell people how awesome this game is. I'm so impressed by it and can't wait for the second one coming out this year!!! So stoked! Buy it! You are missing out!"
4,"Awesome game, but does get repetitive.","Excellent game, great story line, large levels, great visuals. The only con is that it gets kind of repetitive after a while."
2,Snoozer,"This game is bit of a bore. It's repetative, slow moving, overly complicated, and it lacks character. It looks cool, but 3 different gamers in my house all lost interest in it after getting about 15-25% through it."
5,"Thanks, Very fast Shipping","Very fast shipping. Got the game on time. Great service, will definitely buy some more stuff from here. Thanks"
5,Best Franchise,The assassins creed franchise is the best video game series Ive ever played. Just play them and you'll see why.
1,Like being sadistically tortured,"...but hey, being sadistically tortured is more fun than this waste of plastic.PROS:-Good Graphics-Jumping from high buildings is funCONS:Everything else.This game is the most repetitive and completely pointless game ever. Pretty much all you do is climb buildings and kill people. That's it. There's some good gore in the game and good graphics, both of which do not a game make.The plot on the other hand is a complete ripoff of The Matrix, just with the ""other world"" being Ancient times. The voice acting is absolutely terrible and some of the characterization is terrible to.Just rent this game, don't buy it."
1,Repetitive.,"Pros: Good graphicsCons: Everything else. Poor controls, VERY repetitive, there are only 2 or 3 things you do in the whole game (climb buildings, kill soldiers, and then climb more buildings), long boring cutscenes that you can't fast forward through, and the worst voice acting I think I've ever heard."
4,Don't send me articule,"I have been waiting for this game for a long time, and i have not seen, i ask you please you send it, because i paid for it and do not have sent thank you."
4,Assassins Creed,"Assassins Creed was awesome. The way he climbs and jumps from building to building. It is a little unrealistic on how far he jumps, but it is still worth playing. The ending wasn't how I expected, it didnt really have an end. Thats the only bad things about it. It will keep you playing for a long while. Overall, It is worth the $60. Everyone should try it."
5,Assassins Creed customer review,"You guys are amazing for online purchases. I'm an active duty service member overseas and I buy all my electronics and games from you. You have the fastest shipping on the web and I am very comfortable buying from you. Thats bout it. If amazon.com was a woman I'd make sweet sweet love to you, ::sexy wink::Sincerely,Smith, W."
5,excellent game,"excellent graphics and animation. very cool game, a litle difficult to remenber all the controls options depending of the situation. but i enjoy a lot."
3,Could have been better,"Solid game, but very repetitive. It was very obvious this game was rushed--hopefully the sequel will be better."
5,Great Game,"I loved the graphics, the movement style, the way the levels were laid out. all of it was great. The plot was quite interesting aswell. cant say anything bad about it."
3,Nobody can see me because i'm wearing a hood,"I played this game for one day and i have to say this game is lame. Most of the missions involved assassinating people without alarming them and if you get caught that means you suck at games. The missions are repetitive ,the controls suck especially fighting , and the story is confusing."
5,Gave this as a gift,Gave this as a gift and he loves it. Already playing it and I can't get him away from it.
4,amazing game to play and think with your mind...,"I just bought this game to learn about the story of the game.I think this is not a game for anyone who don't like history of the past.The game is one of the best games I have ever played.I played splinter cell since it started, and now I started playing this one and is a good game to spend time to have fun playing and see what is gonna happend next! I will give this game a four out of five because I know the II and III parts are going to be better than this one!"
3,"Starts off great, gets tired.","This game starts off really great, but after you've committed the first big assassination it gets stale quickly. It wasn't long before I had the feeling of ""been there, done that."" Granted, the foes become more numerous and stronger, but you are still doing the same things as you did before: climbing towers, eavesdropping on people, picking pockets, and dealing with guards who don't like you and want to kill you.Be aware that you can't play this game with kids in the room. It's rated M for a reason. I'm long jaded by video game violence, but that and the F-bombs that are dropped in this game make it unsuitable for children.Evaluating the game from the start to the end of the first assassination, I'd rate this game a five (5) star game. From there though, it drops to a three (3) due to its repetetiveness. Making it all the way to the end of Memory Block Seven (7) can tax your patience."
3,"Great First impressions, but quickly fades.","This game starts off very fun. The graphics are great, as are the game controls (once you get used to them), and the open world interaction. You can go mostly anywhere you want in the games and climb on anything as long as it has a place to grab on.Then comes the actual storyline (or lack there of) and missions. At first these things seem fine, but you will soon realize that you are performing the few missions over and over (one of which is sitting on a bench) to progress a weak story that you don't really care about.I initially had fun playing this games because of the controls and graphics. As those things wore off I quickly became bored because of the lack of content in the story and missions. I would still recommend trying the game for yourself, but you should save yourself potential big disappointment and rent the game before you buy it."
5,Damn,One of the best games i've played in a while. Replay value is nil but otherwise its two thumbs up.
3,d and d rogue,"this is a video game all about a wussie who calls himself an assassian hanging out in the old days and wasting people.you might ask did he do it for money or jewels or to get a sorcerer to take a hex off of his only brother?but no,he does it because this grouchy old man tells him to.the reason i called him a wussie is because he is always getting his butt kicked.not by dragons,goblins or ogres but by everyday guards.these guards will stomp your guts out for breathing or just about anything like that.so our wussie here usualy ends up running a marathon.he is not actualy expected to kill his attackers but kill the boss and then run away like a chicken with its head cut off.so what im getting at is this game was considered one of the greatest games of the year but that is the overstatement of the year because its slightly better than most games but not stellar.if you can get it cheap go with it.otherwise you are not missing much."
4,"Great game, awaiting sequel","Awesome gameplay, but rather repetitive storyline. Hopefully Assassin's Creed II will have a better storyline."
4,Assassins Creed,"Enjoyed the game. It took a little to get the story down and what to do, but once I figured it it was awesome."
2,Why read a long review?,"The game is worth the rent. Beautiful visuals, decent storyline, fun combat, very repetitive. Great idea to run up walls and reach very high points but not worth the continuing side quests.""Thanks for playing. Game Over"""
1,sloppy seller,"The shipment took forever to get in and when it did the product was in poor condition. The games case was messed up which I can live with, but upon inspecting the game, I was very displeased. There are scratches all over the game. Will not order from this seller again"
1,Terrible! Frustrating and needs work!,"i cant tell you how many times ive screamed and wanted to break my xbox over how annoyingly frustrating this game is. while aesthetically pleasing the gamplay is complete shit. Considering one of the genres for this game is a platformer, saying they ""dropped the ball"" would be an understatement, ive ran into so many consistent flaws on parts of this game i feel like it was tested by monkeys if tested at all! Dont bother with this one if you havent started playing this series yet, i highly suggest starting with assasins creed 2. this game is complete garbage and should also add that theyre combat system in this is terrible as well. i couldnt even pay $5 for this game now knowing how poorly this game was made"
1,This game sucks....bad,"Im gonna tell you straight up, this game sucks, the graphics are superb, but the gamplay fell flat on it's face, the most fun part is jumping up buildings. Other than that you get in a lame sword fight which is reminicent of any button mashing game, mainly the x button. Don't waste your money. Now I remember why I stopped playing videogames, you spend all your money and the return sucks. Now you're out 60 dollars and your stuck with this sucky game that you can trade-in for 20 dollars."
1,not that great,the game is not what i expectedpros the graphics and the horse since it was easy to handle and it followed you so you don't have to go looking for itconsstorymap is pretty bad you can make it bigger but it shows just a dot for you not a arrow for which way you are pointing so you have to run a ways to see which way you are going and that hard since i trying to find look out towers or city'swell everything this games is pretty bad
1,it didn't work,"i only got to play the game twice, after that it always froze on me. I couldn't even finish the game, i just got pissed off because i had to reset the module everytime it froze so i gave up on it."
1,"collect flags, unfun","I found this game about collecting flags. Then near the end, a fight that is uncompilable."
1,Dissapointment,"The graphics, world, story, and all that are wonderful. But the game as a whole is stupid, repeditive and basic. They could have done so much more with it. If I could do it over again I would rent it and then have realized what a horrible waste of money it is. This game sucked."
1,Worst 360 Game Yet,I played this game three times and couldn't run to sell it on ebay fast enough. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did. I had high hopes for this game. I've been playing games since Pong. This was seriously one of the biggest disappointments I've experienced in my lifetime of playing video games.
2,What a waste of time,"This is one of the worst game I played. While the graphic is amazing, the gameplay itself is annoying. When you play the game you can imagine the expanse of the world. However, once you start playing, the newness of it is gone. The tasks and objectives are so repetitive that I stopped playing after 3 hours. The objectives in each city is the same. Climb up high, pick pocket...That seals the deal. I won't even try to play the 2nd Assassin Creed. I'm actually quite dissapointed with Ubisoft with this."
3,"Great concept, poor variety.","A decent game that become very monotonous with repetitious tasks. However, the graphics and smooth animations make it a worthwhile playthrough. Initially the ""wow"" factor is very high, with beautiful landscapes and amazing animations. However, too much of a good thing is a bad thing, and this game is no different. Fun for a bit, but wearing in the long haul. Worth the playthrough if it's found at a bargin basement price."
2,boring,I was told to try this series of games. This one was very boring to me. I did beat it but I was just bored with the story. But it is needed to understand the back story I suppose.
2,Not great. At all,"I played a few video games in my life and this was surprisingly really bland and boring. I admit I had fun running around climbing walls and Jumping from building to building, but it got boring after an hour. Maybe the game gets better, but I couldn't get through the firs couple of hours. Now its just collecting dust."
2,Overrated,Im glad that I got this game later instead of buying it when it was $59.Repetitive and nothing great about it.Very boring game.All of the others of this series are the same.More like Assassins Greed.
4,Great start to the series but can we get some closure???,"This game was fantastic both visually and in satisfying your blood lust. It does get to be a little bit repetitive and it took a minute to figure how to find your objectives after they stop giving them to you. The only real complaint that I have though is the ending, like most I think it could have given us a little more closure. Those few things added up to an overall 4 of 5 stars for me but it's still one of the best games released this year!"
4,"Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda","Assassin's Creed almost distinguished itself as one of the best video games of the year, but it ended up falling a bit short. The good: the cities are incredibly dense and detailed. It's amazing how much there is going on there, and how good it looks. You really get a feel for the city when you go for the bird's eye view. Another positive is the sword fighting - maybe it's not the best in the world, but I have fun with it. As for the bad, the game is awfully repetitive. If they had varied the game a bit, it could have overcome its other shortfall - the incredibly weak AI.Still, it all adds up for a very enjoyable game. I just hope it's successful enough for a sequel, and the makers listen to the complaints and take this series to the next level."
3,meh,well what can i say about this game that has not been said i though this game would be the best game all year but i was wrong its the kinda of game where you do the same thing over and over and over come on even grand theft auto had you doing something different every now and then
4,"Great Game, Amazing Graphics....Repetitive","I really enjoyed the game, but after awhile, it got super repetitive. I kept playing but thought about quiting on the game multiple times."
4,"Great Concept, Foundation for a Great Series!",Looking forward to future installments of Assassin's Creed. This game has a lot of potential.
1,One of the most boring games I have ever played,"This game is beautiful. It's been a few years since it came out, and it is still one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.I also have to add that the combat in the game is pretty cool as well. But my positive comments on the game end there.The actual game is very repetitive to the point that nothing can save it. I was really dreading the fact that I had to climb nine more towers. Or that I had to eavesdrop on five more conversations. It all became one big monotonous boondoggle, and I finally had to put the game aside after about 12 hours of game play. If there was a levelling up system, it might make the game slightly more interesting. But from what I could tell, the only rewards that you get in this game are when you complete the storyline missions.I probably won't be picking this one up again."
3,Don't Know,"This was the wrong game, so I sent it back. I haven't received my refund as of yet however."
5,Meat Grinder of Fun,"This is a refreshingly fun game with tons of adrenaline pumping moments. It seems like half of the NPCs will attack you on sight sending you on one death defying adventure after the other. At first, I missed the ability to really set up a nice quiet little assassination but by the end I was craving the free for alls that result from your mere presence. This game took me on one wild ride and the final conflict had everything plus the kitchen sink."
3,Fascinating premise,"Assassin's Creed has an amazing plot, amazing voice acting, and a great feeling; however, it falls short of an enjoyable video game. It's best seen as an alpha version to Assassin's Creed II and its amazing follow ups. In this specific game, everything feels like a dull, watered down version. The control schemes have not been fine tuned and it just feels very...clunky. There are some minor annoyances, such as unintentionally leaping to a wrong ledge because you have limited control over your character, and then are are major annoyances; a horrible combat system that at times feels broken (timing is off in some ways) or to the fact that the entire game is basically the same nine levels repeated with minor variations.It's an interesting game to play and a good start to a fun series, but it's just incredibly slow and, to be honest, you'd be better off just playing it for morbid curiosity and having more fun with the better made sequels."
2,ok game,i decided to give the game a try. I've been wanting to get into the series for a while and can't just start with the second game. Great story and beautiful graphics but my God are the controls atrocious. I've had to stop playing the game a few times because of the control scheme. Everyone I've talkedwith about the game has the same opinion. Not fluid at all
4,"Not the best, but was necessary!","I started playing the Assassin's Creed series when they came out with Assassin's Creed II. After playing the newer ones I bought this one to clear up some questions I had in the story. The game play was kind of frustrating at times, but this was the original game and I'm glad I played because I now understand the complete story behind the series."
3,Good but repetitive,"The game itself is great. The voice acting of the main character is pretty bad, and the game after a while gets VERY repetitive and easy. But still it's good to play through if you want the whole story as you continue through the series."
3,Meh...,"I realize I'm coming very late to the reviewing party on this game, and other people have already said pretty much everything I have to say about it. I just feel compelled to add my rating to theirs because I was looking forward to this game so much. It's a great concept, it's absolutely gorgeous (really the best part of the game is just moving through the cities), and it has spots of real greatness. There's just too much time between those spots.Really, I think I would have liked this game a lot more if I could have just run for more than ten paces without being attacked by guards. I was looking forward to the stealth aspect, but it's a sandbox world where you're pretty much always in stealth mode. Turns out stealth without objectives (other than ""Get to the next city so the actual game part can start"") is just moving slowly.I've heard the sequel is better, so I guess I'll check that one out."
4,Great game... during your first run...,"AC is a great game but it is quite flawed. The game is brilliant the first time you go through with an amazing story, great atmosphere, and fun gameplay. However, once you finish the game once it gets really annoying when you try going through it again, due especially to the fact that the in-game lectures that provided great backstory the first time through are not skippable. There are also some flaws in the game itself, most famously the fact that the game is quite repetitive, though I don't find the repetition as bad as some other people. In addition to all this, the game is very short at only 7-10 hours, though those 7 hours are very, very fun."
4,Fun With Assassins,"Great graphics . Great story. But watch out, you can get sucked into the game trying to beat all of it's mini missions. With all of the mini games needed to complete a mission expect long levels. Very time consuming, but extremely fun to play. With the great story line, great graphics and characters, you can't help but get drawn into the game."
4,Repetitive but captivating,"Although there was a lot of repetition in this game, it is beautifully rendered and still very entertaining. While some gamers may be turned off by a game that doesn't constantly offer action, I enjoy following story lines and playing games out like a virtual and interactive book or movie. So while there are some slow spots in the game, I think it all evens out in the end, because the last half hour or so of the game is pretty intense."
2,"Stay away, just buy the 2nd game","Tl;dr finding flags, repetitive frustrating missions, and annoying side missions.My first attempt at playing this game ended with me finishing the first missions and the game froze...would not continue no matter what I did.2nd attempt was a better attempt. I managed to play through until he 4th assassination. At which time I realized that I had done the same mission 4 times and the side missions 12+ times (which are required to advance in game)The game is repetitive and can burn you out on the series, your best bet is to just buy the 2nd game and start from there."
3,"Average, at best...","Man, I was really looking forward to this game, Maybe Mass Effect will be better? I am just a little disappointed in this game, for the simple fact that it is just repetitive. The graphics are great, though, and it is fun for the first hour... It is no ""Hitman"" or ""Elder Scrolls""... That is kinda what I thought it would be like... Oh well.. Mass Effect on November 20th, lets hope I can give more stars to that!"
2,"Sorry, no girls allowed AGAIN","Love the graphx... amazing really when you own a 60"" flatscreen, and a 360. What else could a girl want right? I rented the game, but as soon as I got sick of playing a ""male"" character, I returned it to the store not wanting to buy it for myself for that reason alone.Come on guys... how hard is it to write in the ability for a female to be the heroine huh? I expected more, better luck next time."
1,Do Not Buy From This Company,"I have to say, waiting for over one week and paying what I'd pay in a store up the road is ridiculous, we were quoted this game only being $54.99 and we have been charged $64.85. When we called amazon they directed us to Taget, then we got some random email directing us BACK TO AMAZON. SAVE YOURSELF THE GRIEF, go to the local game stop and get your video games. I have my step kids coming in two days, and this game was supose to be a late christmas gift to him in two days, well, I'm not getting this game until January 9th after he leaves, AND IT WAS SHIPPED DECEMBER 27th. Once again, do yourself a favor, buy from somewhere else."
3,Beautiful but repetitive game,"The kids played this game after Christmas for a couple of days, but quickly tired of the repetitive missions and rigidly linear game play. The enemy AI is pretty weak as well.For the first couple of hours though, this game is a sight to behold."
2,"Looks Great, Plays Stupid","Repetitive, boring, circular.The horse controls much better than the horses in Oblivion.Overall, however, the control scheme is annoying and somewhat counter intuitive.The story is ridiculous.Character design and level designs are gorgeous, however.This is the most overrated game of '07. Save your money."
4,This is pretty good.,"The story line in this game is what makes the entire game worth playing. The jumping challenges are tons of fun and amazing to watch. However, the fight simulator is just tragic. It is difficult to turn, counter blows, and changing weapons mid-fight is nearly impossible to do. It is a fun game (don't get me wrong). I just wish the play lived up to the hype."
4,"Good game, but better to rent","This is a good, fun game. It is revolutionare but it seems the designers ran out of ideas early. Once you beat it there is no real point to playing again. Better to rent then buy but it is a must play."
3,Repetitive and redundant.,"Quick review on this one:It's fun, but VERY redundant. I liked the game overall, but here are some of the negative points I wanted to highlight:- It's repetitively redundant (same tasks, fights, etc. over and over).- I don't like how you have to ride the stupid horse to get from one area to another. I wish you could just ""warp"" to the cities you need to get to.- The ""inbetween"" map (the areas in between city portals) is useless and a waste of time. They could have left that part out.- Lastly, the conclusion was a predictable, anti-climactic let-down.It's fun, but buy it used instead of brand new like I did."
2,FUN for 1 Hour,"So I was really excited to get my hands on this game. Even after carefully reading customer reviews of Assassin's Creed of it being boring and repetitive didn't phase me.Now I enjoy all different types of games and this is a great game however, the gameplay is only new to you for an hour.Every action in the game is repeated endlessly throughout the game. It is gorgeous to look at. I find there to be too much dialog where you can't even bypass so you listen to stuff you really don't care about. Its cool to wonder around and climb buildings but how many times must I pickpocket, assassinate and interrogate people. Honestly, that's all you'll do.I've played about 8 hours of this and I'm bored playing it.Again, amazing graphics, poor gameplay.So in conclusion, if I recommend renting the game and decide from there."
3,"Good looking, but repetitious game","I wasn't going to get this game because of all the mixed reviews, but I broke down and got it because there was nothing else left that I wanted to play. First of all, this game has good graphics, big maps, and seems mostly well polished. The game is also long, but not in a good way. It is repetitious, which makes it boring. You have 9 people to kill, but you must perform 3 investigations each time. This involves thngs like eavesdropping and pickpocketing. Before that, you must first climb various towers to discover your investigations. THe climbing is always the same-there is no puzzle solving like in Prince of Persia. On top of that, you have to ride back to your boss after each kill. This is a long and pointless trip. Combat is also slow and clumsy and you have to constantly walk around slowly to blend in and not alert guards. All of this adds up to an extremenly boring game and therefore I cannot recommend it."
3,Rent before you buy,"I had been looking forward to the release of this game since I heard about it months ago. I'm afraid it didn't live up to the hype for me. It's not that it's bad. In fact, the world they've created in many ways is quite amazing. I just have found it to be repetitive and fairly uninteresting. The story is somewhat compelling. It has me interested enough to keep playing, but just barely.The world for Assassin needs to be bigger and more varied. If they took what is good, the 3-D, the movement of the characters, and brought in a more interesting story and less repetitive game play, they'd really have something.Bottom line: Rent it before you play it. Some people would still buy it, but I wouldn't have."
3,Beautiful but slow,"This game has beautiful artwork and an interesting story line, but the game is very linear and is filled with short movies containing long-winded speeches. My wife would walk in and see me with the controller in my lap and say, ""I thought you were playing..."" ""I am,"" I would reply, ""This is it. This is the game."" It's a lot of watching interrupted briefly with some very linear game play. If that's what you enjoy, this is the game for you."
2,"Great look, not-so-great gameplay","For my money, the folks who found this game a bit on the dull and repetitive side have the right of it. The game *looks* fantastic - the cities and buildings, the movement of the horse while riding, the look of the main character . . . all these things are impressive. But who wants to have to ride around looking at a game versus playing it? Plus, if you're riding through the countryside and guards begin chasing you (which happens a lot) you end up running away and missing the scenery anyway.Not being able to skip the cut scenes was aggravating.After saving a few citizens and ""blending"" to evade guards more than a few times, I got bored pretty quickly. Did not find the game particularly intuitive, mostly because the gameplay isn't that deep: there are really only a handful of things the character has to do in this game, and he has to do the a LOT.After looking forward to playing this I've been more than a little disappointed."
2,Cloning Machine,"Although the graphics and the theme of the game had caught my attention--the actual game quickly bored me to tears. After killing the 100th cloned gaurd, and saving the 20th citizen (all citizens say one of three lines when saved), I realized that the developers spent way too much time on graphics and not enough time ON THE ACTUAL GAME. Save your money, go buy prince of persia or mass effect."
2,OVER HYPED UNDER DEVOLPED,"The holiday season is always filled with Hype and big games for the holiday season Assasians Creed is not it. After a holiday season with games such as Gears of War, this is a dissapointment as a Next-Gen games. The story is very indepth and interesting but who cares if the game is uterly repetive. You do the same thing over and over and it gets old very quickly. Coming from Ubisoft who did a great job with the Prince of Persia you would have to think there biggest hyped game on the 360 and Ps3 would be excellent. Instead its a medicore game that will keep gamers licking there wounds until Grand Theft Auto or Metal Gear Solid 4 comes out and shows what next gen games could be. Save your money on this one and rent it, you appericate the advice, once you beat it you will be quick to trading this one in."
2,Great Game ... Terrible Ending,"(SPOILER ALERT) My review is based upon what happens at the end of the game.I really liked playing Assassin's Creed. The action was great. I loved the fact that it required me to do things like climb towers to open up more of my option in a town.That being said, the end was so bad that it completely overshadowed the rest of the game. I'm trapped in the lab and the Templars got everything they needed from me? That just plain sucks. It made me feel like I lost. I actually looked up a walk-through because I thought I screwed up and missed something. Nope that's the way the game ends. I was hoping that I'd get to use all those assassin skills to escape from the lab, rescue my family, and defeat the Templars. Oh well."
3,"Ok game, but for the price GREAT!","Not a bad game, a tad too much but enjoyable to play when your passing time. I would never pay [...] for it but thanks to Amazon I got it for around [...]. So well worth it!"
2,Really disappointing...,"The concept of running and jumping from building to building, ledge to ledge is great. If the rest of the game worked then it would be excellent. The AI sucks. In the middle of the game you are wondering around trying to figure out what you are supposed to be doing, instead you become lost."
2,I was so excited!!!!,"But this game was a HUGE letdown!!! This game is wack with a capital w. Yeah, it's WACK! It has great graphics and smooth animations but the overall fun factor isn't there.It's like Ubisoft spent all their time making it look good. Running on beams and hopping from rooftop to rooftop was cool, but...what else is there really? The little other that there is, is repeated over and over. I advise everyone to stay away. Maybe they'll do something more with the sequel. They have some ideas here that should be expanded on."
3,Alright,"The game itself was great and the shipping was wonderful, my only complaint would be that it came in a black play station 2 box, rather than the box it shows in the picture, not really a problem, the picture is just a little misleading though"
2,Picture does not match actual item,"The lock in the picture shows the Chicago double bitted key and lock, a high security keyway used in gumball machines. The product received contains a generic single sided key and lock."
5,great quality,very happy would order again if neededshiped promptly great price 1/3 of what sears sells forquality is great
3,a little rough with the shipment,THis item wasn't packed well enough so some of the nutriberries crumbled. My parrots don't really eat the crumbs so some of the pricey treats are wasted. Paying a little more to get a properly packed item would be worth it to me.
1,My African Grey won't eat it.,"The packaging is good; quality of the ""berries"" appears fine. For me, the bottom line is that my parrot won't even try it."
5,Tropical Fruit Nutri-Berries,"My birds love these treats and would throw a temper tantrum if they didn't get them every morning for breakfast! Excellent transaction with Amazon. Thank you, very much!"
5,bird treats,"my sun conures love these, i put them in a little green treat holder that they have to figure out how to open to get them, they figured it out the first day, wow they love them, just a little spendy"
2,Quality Sucks!,"Iration is a sick band and I'm a huge fan, but although all these tracks are good the quality on the MP3 download tracks 3,5, and 6 are horrible."
2,Too many sequels,"Little Polar Bear, Lars, has experienced several adventures in previous booksabout discovering friendship with diverse creatures in unfamiliar settings.While the first book was charming, and the beautiful illustrations continue todelight, the story lines have become strained. In this one, Lars&#65533; lop-sidedfriendship with an oil-smeared puffin, and a brief scary flight in a hot airballoon were disappointing."
2,"Great shows, lackluster episodes","Not as good as I wanted it to be since I was trying to bring back memories of my childhood. On the other hand, most of my favorite old shows!"
1,Not what I thought I was gettning.,This might have been ok but it was not what I thought I was ordering. I ended up giving it away.
5,Disney Holiday dvd,I enjoy dvds for Christmas its my favorite times of the year . I like Lizzie Mc Guire .
3,Should have no cost...,What a weird mix of cartoons and shows. You may or may not recognize some of these shows. Not all are really that holiday oriented. Still worth a few bucks. Will keep the kids busy for a while during the holiday season.
5,I can't wait!!!!!,"I love all of these shows. But if I'm not mistaken, I think there is a never befor seen episode of Phil Of The Future as a bonus feature."
4,good,here is my opinion on these episodes on the dvd:lIZZIE MCGUIRE: suckedKIM POSIBLE: goodPHIL OF THE FUTURE: goodTHE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY: greatTHATS SO RAVEN: THE BEST EVER SO FUNNYEVEN STEVENS: GOODTHIS IS ONE GOOD DVD AT A LOW PRICE AND IT HAS 6 EPISODES NOT 4
4,What shows will be on this DVD?,"Does anyone know what shows will be on this DVD besides That's So Raven, Lizzie McGuire, Even Stevens, Kim Possible and The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody? Any ways, are there even any other shows on DVD beside the ones I listed?"
2,Not that many black metal bands around,"Looks a bit cheap and feels cheaper due to the ""wrapped link"" construction. If they had gone with solid links then I would have rated this much higher. Due to the scarcity of black metal watch bands ( I have no idea why they are so rare) you have little choice unless you get buy the whole setup with a black watch and band together. I had a black Spidel Twist-O-Flex that was not PVD and it's starting to wear off (the finish).PVD is the way to go, as it is fairly durable. So my search for a quality black metal band continues. My watch needing the black band is a Citizen Navihawk Blue Angeles edition."
4,Just what I needed,"Perfect for a Harry Potter party. I didn't have any problem with the quality and the kids loved it. It's cheap plastic, but that's what I expected for the price."
4,Just For Fun,"I bought this toy, along with other little things, to give to my friend for her birthday. Being a Harry Potter fan, I thought it would be cute. The snitch is larger than expected, but still great. It is probably more for looks than actual play time, due to the material it is made out of, but I would definitely suggest it just for a fun gift for any Harry Potter fan. :)"
3,ok for price paid,"not made as well as we had hoped, but for the price we paid, we cant really complain. It is a stocking stuffer for christmas so no reaction by the receiving party yet, but were certain he will be pleased to add it to is HP collection"
1,Golden Snitch?,"This item was extremely disappointing--VERY cheap. A hard plastic ball that I really wouldn't describe as golden at all, and ugly, stiff plastic wings that were stuck to the cardboard packaging. The worst of it is that I paid the princely sum of $12 for it.... A terrible product."
3,remember it is plastic,"This was a perfect gag gift for the Harry Potter fan. It is just as described. A plastic toy. It's cheap, but it did what I wanted it to do...bring a smile to my friend's face."
3,This Snitch is not exactly Golden,"I ordered this Golden Snitch to be used for a scavenger hunt at a Harry Potter party. Unfortunately, it should be renamed 'The Black Snitch with gold-trimmed wings'! The ball part of the snitch is black! I am going to have to find some gold paint (added expense!) and paint the ball gold before the party, because no one will be happy with a BLACK Snitch."
3,Just okay,I agree with other reviews that said you get what you pay for. The shipping was more than the product.. Once this was opened by my child she never touched it again.
2,Not good quality,"In the picture, this looks like a very good quality item, but when I opened it, both of its wings fell off and when I put them back in they don't stay. It is also chipped on the front. So, overall, I would tell you not to order this."
2,dumb thing to buy,i don't even know where this thing is. they thought it was cool but can't & don't really play with it.
1,Crap,"This item is crap. Yes its cheap so what do you expect right?? It got a nice ahhhhh a snitch, then tossed off the side never to be seen again."
1,Broken,This item was so flimsy that it broke as I removed it from the package to put on the cake for decoration. My child never even got the chance to play with it before it broke. I would say it's not really recommended for play and much more for display.
4,The Golden Snitch,I bought the Golden Snitch to use on a 10 year old's Harry Potter theme birthday cake. It worked great for that purpose and now he plays with it.
3,It was ok...,"I thought the ball of the snitch would be rubber so if the kids through it around it would just bounce. But it's a hard plastic so after the initial intrest the kids lost intrest and it's gone into the box with the rest of the ""lame"" toys."
3,OK,This was a really nice toy accesory however it is plastic and it might fall apart easy. L.P. 10 years old
3,broke when received,We ordered this for a harry potter party and it was partially broken when received. It still worked for our snitch hunt but I was dissapointed. I tried to contact customer service but that was impossible. One of the wings on the side is cracked where it connects to teh ball.
2,Kind of dumb!,"Got this because it was only $.18. But I'm not sure it was even worth that much! So, no, I wouldn't recommend."
3,HARRY POTTER GOLDEN SNITCH,I was hoping that this would have some value other than looking cute on my 8 year old grandson's book shelf. It did prove to be of greater appeal than expected. My daughter asked me to hide it somewhere in the park's shrubbery before my grandson's Harry Potter themed birthday party began. The party guest who found the Snitch won a special prize. A pastry chef prepared an awesome birthday cake with a look-alike edible Snitch on top. The party was a big success.
3,Good value; average quality,"I can't complain to have gotten this 3 piece set for $80. I've taken the middle one on two trips so far. The handle is pretty nice but the zipper is not smooth or sturdy. When the luggage is not filled, I have trouble running the zipper around certain sections already. During my last trip, we probably overpacked it. It was scary to see our luggage coming out of the conveyor belt in a plastic wrap. The zipper seems to have given up during the trip and a third of the contents were peeking out in the plastic wrap. We were able to get the zipper back aligned eventually."
3,"Very slow moving, but it got good (eventually).","The Grounding of Group 6 looked like an excellent book, and it was. But if you're like me (your mind wanders), then I don't think this book is for you. I have trouble focusing on books unless they are good from the first paragraph. I read the first chapter of the book and thought it was okay. Then as I was reading the second chapter, I thought that this story was never going to actually start. Well, it does....on about page 70 (or so). It's a really good book, but I was so close to not finishing it because of it's late start."
4,Just as advertised,"This was exactly what I was looking for--the exact edition of a particular book I'd had as a teenager--at a terrific price. It's not in perfect condition, but it would have cost a lot more if it were, so I'm pretty satisfied."
3,great if you like merzbow,Interesting take on some merzbow songs. This is one of those things you'll either adore (merzbow and noise fans) or it'll leave you scratching your head. I was particularly fond of the Haters track....
4,Extremely catchy metalcore,"This is something I normally might not be into, just because they're are so many bands that sound similar, the genre has become stale. However just the pure nostalgia of this album, driven into my subconscious by the great melodies and super catchy hooks, draws me back over and over. Bands that I would immediately compare these guys to are Zao, Society's Finest and maybe FATA. Each song is distinct and has its own feel. The production is very good as well. Basically if you like epic, 'valiant' melodies that stick in your head along with good heavy mosh grooves, I reccomend you get this."
5,Burning Bridges,"Haste The Day is by far one of the coolest hardcore/metalcore bands out today, my personal favorite. The fact that they're a Christian band with a positive message is icing on the cake. Burning Bridges is their first Full length album, so definately pick this one up before you get When Everything Falls. The vocals are intense throathy growls combined with a wailing lead guitar. This is a must buy.xx"
4,Haste The Day TURN IT UP!!!!,"Having seen these guys close to twenty times before the release of this album, I definately had high hopes and these guys delivered a great album. The way they mesh together as a band allows them to write music that doesn't showcase their full talent and allows them to have fun. While the vocals resemble the ever so memorable ZAO, the music clearly carries more breakdowns and offers the awesome melody vocals you would never find on a ZAO album. With songs like ""American Love"" and Substance these guys definately throw it down in the hardcore genre. If you are a fan of hardcore, definately pick this album up, you will not be disappointed!!!!"
3,hmmm....,"well i first heard these guys on amazon while sampling music... i liked how the vocalists scream was weird (though kinda sounding like Zao)... i didn't know that the singing was very emo-ish... which i hate... but when i got home and played it i was suprised... i actually liked it... but the bad part is that most of the songs are repetative and too short... i guess its alright for their first CD, but they better do a much better job on their second one (if they come out with one)."
5,One of the best...,"I saw this band in concert, and knew I had to have their CD. It is a perfect blend of amazing lyrics and even better instrumentals. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes Christian hardcore music. Amazing."
2,Yeah...,"This album is a fairly good metal album, and the musicians have some talent and all, but I think I enjoyed this more the first time I heard it when it was under the name ""Zao""."
2,Too Violent,All these vidoes are too violent. None of them end on a positive note. They all go way too far and focus on the violence. My kids don't even want to watch them because of all the violence.
4,Great Taste- Finally Healthy Tea I Really Like!!!,"Due to health benefits of green tea, for years I've been trying to find one I really like so I'll drink 3-4 cups a day. Tho I am life-long tea drinker, I didn't like any of the greens. Severeal weeks ago I tried Clipper Organic White Tea with Vanilla and liked it very much. I now look forward to my calming, healthy, great tasting tea several times a day. This morning I tried one with Cinnammon and it will also be a favorite; can't wait to try some of the others"
1,what a waste,when I got this product the first thing I noticed is it didn't Come with the 2 dishes it should have and it looks ugly and a nasty color don't waste your time with it
1,You get what you pay for.,Wanted a small portable mixer for very small venues. Used it twice. Was using it just for background music. Volume was very low and it still burned up. No wonder it's so cheap.
2,Sound cuts in and out,"Im not sure if it's a coincidence that I ordered this during the hurricane, but every time I turned it on it smelled like it had been waterlogged, although there was no evidence of this on any of the packaging or unit itself. It worked great for about 2 weeks but as soon as I tried taking it to band practice, it started feeding back badly when we plugged a mic in and then cut out. It has been unreliable ever since. The seller was unhelpful as well. If I want to return it, I have to pay the shipping costs. And that's just for a return, not a replacement. (I wasn't even given the option) in summary, i don't know If it was just my unit or a problem that plagues the lot, but unfortunately I got a bad one. The features seemed great, and the power was satisfactory. Which is why I bought it. Too bad it came back to bite me in the ass."
1,"Horrible, cheap and plasticky, also - doesn't froth.","What a total waste of money this was. I'd been after a frother, having used one at a friend's house (but not knowing the brand name) - it looked similar to a Bodum coffeemaker, with a thick metal-and-plastic layered base on a metal rod, within a glass beaker.This thing, however, doesn't even come close. The glass beaker is okay, but the base is plasticky, and the frother end of the mechanism is simply a very thin, wobbly circle of white plastic with some holes in it.Pumping it for 3 minutes, and still - minimal, weak froth (and I'm using full fat milk!), not enough for one small cappuccino.Useless piece of junk. Don't waste your money."
1,"Different from usual - musty smell, one bottle empty","I use Revitlift Day lotion quite frequently to get a little SPF protection.So, I ordered three of these items from Champion Liquidation. These items differed from my normal experience - the lotion has a musty, chemical smell. And, one of the bottles I removed from the carton was empty (no lotion)!I just wanted to pass along my tips in case you are experiencing the same thing and are wondering if you are crazy. Normally I would give Revatalift Complete day lotion 4 or 5 stars but I give this batch 1 star."
1,smells bad. irretates eyes.,"it says Fragrance-Free but has some chemical smell that makes me have a headache.the other L'Oreal, Dermo-Expertise RevitaLift UV is better when it comes to smell."
3,Not for acne prone skin,"Not particulary greasy, but it does make me break out on my forehead. I had tried this in place of my Neutrogena Visibly Firm (which never makes me break out and is a fantastic product) since this had sunscreen. Not worth it. I switched to a foundation with sunscreen."
2,Great Amazon Service,"I don't know about the lotion because the container was broken when I received it. It was not Amazon's fault, Amazon had packed it well, but the bottle had to have already been broken as none of the packaging was damaged at all but the product was hard and was obviously dried up for a long long time. One call to Amazon and they kindly refunded. 5 stars for Amazon packaging and customer service - can't speak for the lotion but not willing to try it again."
5,Reliably good,"This product is the answer to super sensitive skin. I tried other fragrance-free moisterizers with little luck until I bought my first L'Oreal and I've stuck with it ever since because it doesn't irritate my skin and the cost is reasonable compared to department store prices. When L'Oreal stopped manufacturing the fragrance-free line, I was fortunate to find it on Amazon."
5,We Like This Version Just Fine!,"While this differs from the Grimm version, my daughters, who always love a good story, very much enjoy this one. At first I wasn't sure how they would react to how the animals' owners wanted to do away with them, but it was presented in such a way that they weren't bothered by it and instead saw a hopeful outcome. It is a retelling, certainly, and sad parts of the original tale are omitted. My 4-year old asks to be read this one every night--and knows it by heart. She delights in how the animals join forces to get rid of the bad guys! Young children will like this book."
5,ISLP (L),"The animals were going to Bremen Town to be musicians because the owners were going to kill them. On the way to Bremen Town, they met some robbers. The animals stole a house from the robbers.I liked this book because the robbers looked funny."
5,A Visit to Bremen,"After a recent visit to Bremen in Germany, and souvenir t-shirts for the grandkids, I decided to purchase copies of the ""Bremen Town Musicians"" as Christmas presents. I am very pleased with my purchase. I am impressed with the quality of English used, which would surely be of benefit to young ears. Also, the text included some lesser-used words such as 'hound, lute, minstrels', great for vocabulary building. Young minds absorb so much, so let us give them worthwhile things to soak up. The text also lends itself to reading aloud with lots of expression and drama, always enjoyed by children. The illustrations are simple but superb, plentiful and complements the text beautifully - a great help for young readers. I can't wait to read to them on Christmas Day!"
1,Despicable,"I can not understand what world people live in that this book is acceptable to children. What kind of society just feels the need to murder animals once they become useless, and how do you explain that to small children. It may be a classic, but it should be considered a classic mistake. This does nothing but show the vile and sick side of humanity."
4,Great fax machine.,We had the previous model in our offices for years. And for years it performed day after day. When the old one went bad we picked up this model and have been very satisfied.
5,Nice piece of equipment,"This is my second Brother Fax machine, and after thorough review of all that's available out there, Brother leads the way in Fax technology. Great machine, excellent value."
5,Good value,had this machine for about 3 months now. Works great... no issues whatsoever. Feels and sounds solid. Bought it primarily to replace the fax functionality of HP7310 multi-function printer/fax/copier/scan.
1,LOOKS BETTER THAN IT WORKS...,I WOULD NOT TELL ANYONE TO BUY THIS ITEM UNLESS YOU WANT IT FOR LOOKS. I GOT MINE AND YES IT IS VERY VERY CUTE BUT IT NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY. THE TOP OF THE CUPCAKE IS FAR TO HEAVY AND IT DOESN'T MOVE WHEN YOU SET YOUR TIMER. IT WOULD NOT MOVE MUCH AT ALL IN FACT SO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A CHEAPER ONE...
1,Bum timer,"This timer is awful for what I paid for it. I gave it to my daughter for Christmas and when she used it, it stopped at 15 minutes. I have to return for whatever credit I can received because I missed the return deadline."
4,Chic's dig it,"The girl I have been seeing has been looking for one of these forever. She was quite excited when I gave it to her as a gift. Her only complaint was the timer goes off, its not loud enough."
3,Knock 'em down,"It's ok and it is pretty cheap, my 2 year old has a hard time setting the blocks to knock down up on the small space provided and he only knows how to ""Blow them up"" and can't use the tractor to do it yet. But it is cute and the tractor makes cute sounds, too bad it doesn't make an explosion sound!"
5,Fun game.,"I've had absolutely no problems with this game and found it to be a beautifully rendered world with an interesting (if somewhat convoluted) story. Yes, the game has some stiff requirements, mostly in the video card area, but I'm running it off a lowly GeForce 4MX and it rocked along smoothly. I highly recommend it, especially if you were into the original movie or just enjoy computers."
4,"Challenging, yet exciting","I received this game for a Christmas present when I was 12 and absolutely loved it. The graphics were amazing, the game was suspenseful and challenging, and there was always something new and exciting waiting to be discovered. When I didn't feel like delving into the tediousness of the game but wanted something to keep me busy for a few minutes, I loved the ability to play the light racing game separate from the main interface at my own discretion. It was definitely refreshing as a break. Saying this, I saw the original movie and was absolutely bored to tears. ""Tron 2.0"" was definitely a vast improvement from what the movie was, especially in terms of visual effects and action. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves difficult, action/adventure/futuristic games, and who would like to be kept busy for weeks at a time."
3,Just another FPS...,"This review is based upon the SP demo of the game.I played both the lightcycle and First Person Shooter (FPS) levels provided in the demo. The lightcycle game looks interesting, although people without fast reflexes will be hard-pressed on anything but the easiest level of difficulty. The first FPS level, however, didn't strike me as that different from any of the other games of this genre that I've played. Almost immediately I was confronted with a jumping puzzle (land on the right block or fall to your death), and a get-the-right-keys-to-open-doors puzzle that basically just involved opening every ""code box"" to get the right keys to move on. The weapons were fairly common; the disk is a new twist at first but isn't really THAT different from the weapons you've seen before.I'd recommend this to FPS enthusiasts, or people who are fans of Tron and haven't gotten over-exposed to the Quakes ad infinitum out there."
3,you must be joking,"You know, Tron's not some kind of simulator, so why not cut the fat and just make it a game? The gameplay seems to be more about reading emails, budgeting ""subroutines"" (jumping higher, etc.), and ""disinfecting"" yourself than it is about combat. The real action does remind me of the movie, but it feels pretty cheap. It looks good, though.The game's buggy, too. I might not understand everything about the game, but I'm pretty sure that having my disc (primary weapon) vanish every other time I use it is a glitch, because it magically reappears every time I go to an options screen and back. In the game's defense, that was the most frustrating thing about it. *edit-> I finally restarted the game from the beginning, and this problem went away.Not a bad game when it works, but not as novel as I expected. If it didn't look and sound like Tron, it would be very forgettable."
2,Fun but gets old real quick,I bought this game a long time ago and it was always just fun to play periodically but it has no staying power in the sense that when you start playing you get bored very fast.
1,Issue with windows operating system,"I am still trying to resolve game-crash issues with Buena Vista Games. I have well over 70 games and occasionally have had to deal with these kindsof issues. Not often, because I have a high-end system, but this particular game has been a time consuming headache to even get to run.(something I still haven't been able to do!)Companies that code these kinds of games that take many hours of trouble shooting to even play should at least provide a higher level of customer support. I will neverpurchase another game from Buena Vista Games, this was my first, and last!On the plus side Amazon took my return and promptly sent me a new onewithout charging me, your organization rates a ""10"" for customer satisfaction! Thanks much! Paul K. Guzman"
3,You'd better have the hardware and resources for this one,"The game is really a high-powered, resource using, grapical eye-candy ""shooter"".It is really LUDICROUS that this game requires a lot of PC Power and resources - at least a P3700mhz, (p4 RECOMMENDED), more than 256 megs of ram (384 & UP is BEST), a good chunk of hard drive space (maybe around 1 gig or TWO), and MOST IMPORTANTLY, A GRAPHICS CARD WITH (T&L-Transform and Lighting - NVIDIA) or CHARISMA ENGINE POWERED card from ATI. If you have a fast enough PC, you're going to have to spend about $50 or more for a graphics card to play this thing, if you don't have the required hardware to do so.So, it may cost you $60 - $100 and up just to play this game.Consider upgrading your card not just for this thing, but only if you use your pc for DVD viewing and other graphics-intensive tasks."
5,$100?!?!?!?!,$100?!?! I paid $20 for this same clock at Walmart!!!!!!!!! This product is being sold for WAY TOO MUCH!
4,"""I can't talk now I'm hanging sausage!""",The funniest phone prank collection of them all produced by a relentlessly charming guy who masterfully pushes peoples' buttons as easily as he pushes the buttons on his telephone.
3,"Not bad, but not essential","This is pretty standard Merzbow wall-o-noise meandering, short, sweet, and to the point. Nothing groundbreaking here; if you're a Merzbow fan, you'll enjoy it. If you're not, there are many better places to begin your education (Music for Bondage Performance, Venereology, Batztoutai, etc.)."
5,prompt service,"This book was bought as a fathers day gift.Prompt service! I think I had it within 4 days of ordering! Rather surprising, I expected at least a week! Good seller!"
2,"Ach. I didni like it, no.","I began 'A Disaffection' enthusiastically. Aside from the brilliant Glaswegian vernacular and some tasty morsels of cynicism, however, the book felt long, slowly paced, and overdrawn. Doyle's character and predicament -- his disillusionment, like of drink, near-obsession with co-worker Alison, and fascination with cardboard pipes, of all things -- are largely described and summed up within the first two pages. Literally. After these, everything is redundant. Doyle is dissatisfied, and true to the title, disaffected; you'll likely feel the same after reading this novel."
5,Good but violent,"Displays the same enchanting characters as the circle of magic series also by Tamora Pierce. It is a violent book, which may be disturbing to some people. I suggest not to start with this book if you are just starting to read Tamora Pierce. I suggest you start with ""Alanna, The First Adventure""."
3,Definitly NOT Tamoras best,I loved the books about Daine and Alanna. Thats the main reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2. The next set about the circle were o.k. These ones...well let me just say I was dissapointed. And I mean VERY dissapointed. It has an interesting and promising storyline but it just does not come together. I advise you to avoid it and if you insist on reading it then borrow or get from the library.
3,Sandry is alooone...,"The best aspect of this book, I would say, is the plot. It's dramatic, exciting, and pulls no punches, especially at the end. My main gripe with this was that I missed Briar, Daja and Tris - one of the most interesting bits of the original CoM series was the interaction between the four very different children. Pasco was an average character, but didn't interest me as much as Briar does. This is one of the best Tamora books for action, but if you want character, you might want to try something else."
5,Magic Steps,"I give this book five stars and here is why. In the book Magic Steps, a boy named Pasco finds theat he has the power to dance magic. The lady of the land finds out and being a mage herself, wants to help Pasco control his power. So she does. The rest of the book goes into a murder story. On how Pasco, the lady of the land, and the mage council catch the murderers. Also how Pasco's first experience with a mage goes. I think that Tamhora Pierce did a great job on writing the book Magic Steps. I encourage readers throughout America to read this book."
4,I thought it was very good,"This book was very good even though I missed Tris, Briar, and Daja and it was sad that they weren't together. Otherwise this is a very good book. I recomend it to anyone who likes fantasy, tamora pierce is a great writer."
1,Simply Shocked!,"I am a big Peirce fan, but when I read this book I was shocked!!! It was disgusting and violent. Murderers who seek revenge over a death in their family leave (literally) heads hanging from the ceilings. Sandry is suppose to help to track these murderers down and get rid of them. It was creepy how the murderers just appeared out of thin air to murder these peaple. One of the worst parts was that the murderers used a young boy who has very unusal magic, to move around. I won't go into more detail because it is to horrible. If you like Redwall you will enjoy this book(no offence). Not all of the book is really bad. Sandry takes on a young boy who does magic through danceing,(which is especially cool becouse I dance). I am waiting for the next book(Street Magic)to see if it is any better. This book just didn't feel like Tamora Peirce."
4,4 stars up,This book is really good but I would not let your kids read it until you have read. This book is a bit more detialed with blood and stuff. This would be 5 stars but for that fact. My parents would not let me read this right away. I can't wait to read the third book. This book is about Sandry and pasco. Pasco is a young boy who has dance magic. There has been killings going but the only proof is unmagic....
4,better than the Circle of Magic books,"me and all my friends are huge friends of tamora pierce. we adored her tortall books(we own them all) and were actually somewhat disapointed with her circle of magic series. we were very glad that pierce decided to write another series on sandry, tris, daja, and briar. this book is better in several ways, but the one i really liked was that it focused on only one of them. when pierce wrote the circle of magic books, i think that the fact that she focused on four people instead of one messed things up. this was a definite improvement and I look forward to the next three"
4,"an excelent book, but not for everyone.","This book continues the story of Sandry, one of the four mages that were in the first books. Sandry is taking care of her uncle, who just had a heart attack, when she sees a young boy that seemed to be dancing magic. She finds out from her old teacher that because she found out about the boy's magic, she must teach him the basics of magic. While Sandry is finding all this out, a mysterious murder takes place. Nobody knows how the murderer got away with it, because none of the magical alarms went off, and none of the guards saw or heard anything. Sandry finds out that only her and her student can stop the murderers, and it will be incredibly hard. This book is amazing, but it can be very grusome at times, so it might not be the best book for everyone."
