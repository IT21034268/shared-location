2,Interesting college thesis-turned-book...,"I chose this book for my bookclub which is comprised of 8 very diverse women and we overwhelmingly felt that while the book was informative, it is clearly a college thesis paper that has been expanded into a book. The writing style is dry and boring and laboriously detailed most of the time. The actual content of the book does contain useful and thought provoking information yet the reader is inundated with far too many unecessary details...Overall, I would not recommend it..."
1,The usual double standard!,"Would a book like this be written about men? Do men ever need to explain there sexual behaviors? The answer is no! Did it ever occur to the author that women like having sex, dressing sexy & just like being sexual overall? Why does she assume that all women who are open with their sexuality are just trying to please someone else? Maybe we like pleasing ourselves! It's funny how if a man is raunchy, sexual & crude he's just being a man & nobody questions it yet, if a woman is, something is wrong with that. It' inappropriate, it's wrong, it's degrading, etc. We're labeled ""sluts"" ""whores"" & ""Hookers & Men are just being ""men"" ""macho"" ""a player"" or ""pimp"". If a woman feels comfortable with her sexuality then she has the right to express it if that is how she feels comfortable. We shouldn't have to worry about being labeled, look down upon or disrespected!"
2,"Fancy title, not much else.","Shrewish. Prude. Judgemental. Blathery. Catty. Disjointed.What a shame. There's a lot to be said about female sexuality and feminism in general, but Levy doesn't bother with the core of any it. Instead, she spends her time interviewing the flightiest Spring Breakers she can find, criticizing successful women for acting manish, and obsessing about fringe cultural fads.I was disappointed to see so many prejudices in Levy. She is one of the worst FCPs I've read. And a stick in the mud, to boot."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"Levy wants to be an important feminist, and she's not even close. She's not even in Naomi Wolf territory. She gets milage out of stating the obvious. Who doesn't know that women look at themselves as sex objects? Women's Studies 101 students could write this book. Someone must be looking on her well to have given her all this attention for a book that doesn't add anything important to cultural debate."
3,What's Old News is New News Once More,"Ho hum...From Life 101:- Some people in life are very attractive- Some of the above people really enjoy sex- Some of the above people are exhibitionists- Some of the above people discover that can achieve a bit of fame and fortune practicing sex, so they cease the opportunity- Some of the above people want even more - so they wave various banners: victim, liberation-equality, etc., and hope to achieve even more from their sexual (pre) occupation--deeds/misdeeds.So we have this book, in many cases explaining obvious current social sexual mores/taboos/hang-ups and those that take advantage of/try-to-change/object-to/promote them.I recommend this book as one of several supplements belonging in a junior high school sex-ed class....Next"
3,Just part of the story...,"The author chronicles the slide in standards for the behavior of ""modern"" women. But the most important parts of this story orbit just past the author's mindset. First, when ""girls try to be like the boys"" in the name of equality, they are not successful. We are hard-wired for our male and female roles far more than feminists have ever wanted to admit. Second, sexuality without context; spirituality, love or procreation, usually leads to an empty cul-de-sac. Sex is important when it is considered important. The author relates how sexuality is commoditized and used as a way to keep score. Unfortunately, the game and the prize lacks the fulfillment that I believe everyone deep inside is really looking for.The author's prose is crisp and the book is a quick read. The book offered some insight into the ""hook-up generation,"" but it proved less fulfilling in conclusions due to the author's constraining feminist point of view. Read it and decide for yourself."
5,I loved this book,What an eye-opener. It certainly helped me understand why my occasional lectures on feminism and art given at colleges and universities are meeting with more and more hostility and misunderstanding.
5,Very Interesting,"""We skipped over the part where we just accept & respect that SOME women like to seem exhibitionistic & lickerish, and decided instead that EVERYONE who is sexually liberated ought to be imitating strippers and porn stars""I chose that quote because it illustrates what drew me to this book. It examines our fascination with raunch culture without being A) a prudish lecture telling us all to behave, cover up and be good little girls or B) trying to convince us that by acting as wild, slutty and uninhibited as we can we are really showing how empowered and liberated we are. This is something I haven't really seen accomplished before and makes reading it worthwhile. The writing itself does come across a bit like a series of articles; however it didn't bother me very much at all."
4,Cleverly Written,"I read this book and then read _Pornified_. Levy's book is superior of the two. She gives detailed examination of the ""rise of raunch culture"" and it's support by young women. This is not an academic tome or a polemic. Her audience is vast- academics will hopefully use it and the lay audience should also read it.I found the writing clear and clever and not the least bit condscending, which is important if young women and men are going to read this book. I'm going to assign portions of this book in one of my WS classes this term and I'll post a later review about that."
2,Fun idea but difficult to actually use,These 4 books are cute and a fun idea. But it is actually very difficult for even an adult to match the pages up. Sometimes the matching card/page will be all the way at the back and its physically difficult to get the books pages to flip that way. Cute idea but in real life it's not that great. Wish I had just bought some regular Eric Carle books.
5,Baby Books,I purchased these books for my nephew. He isn't old enough yet to appreciate them but hopefully when he is he will love them. These books are full of bright colors and easy to read font. The hard covers are especially good considering the age group they're intended for. They were shipped well within the given dates and arrived inperfect condition. I highly reccommend this book set.
5,my grandson is much enjoying the books,I sent this to my grandson's 1st birthday and he is so much enjoying the books. thank you very much for the order
3,"Nice drawings, hard to turn pages","As usual when it comes to Eric carle the isno question about his drawings. They are just awesome. But the format it is not the best one. Although probably vey didactic, it's just hard to turn the pages. Maybe with time and use it gets better."
5,Nice set,This came on time and was what I expected. I love Eric Carle's books and so did my son when he was little. now I give them to my grandchildren.
3,"Difficult for small children, but nice","Good books, but a little difficult for small children because of the half-pages. The pictures are colorful and the choice of vocabulary is nice, all in Eric Carle's style. Better for 2-3 year olds."
2,Not the best from Eric Carle,"I was very disappointed when i recieved the book set. It is not your typical Eric carle Book, Each page has a picture and the word but above you have to flip through the whole book to find the matching word. It's kind of hard to explain. Stick with Brown Bear Brown bear and the other classic Eric Carle books, this one really sucks."
4,bright and fun for kids,"it is a good purchase, my kid love to see and hear me read the books. she will love to read it herself very soon."
4,Pretty good PPV,"Stupid idea to have Shamrock and X-Pac keep the belts. Gunn and Gangrel should have won the IC and Euro belts. The ""I Quit"" match was excellent. Having Vinnie Mac win the Royal Rumble totally sucked. Dumb idea to have Bossman vs. Road Dog non-title. Wait till the price goes down, don't buy it for 33.99...."
3,Not Great But Not Bad,The Road Dogg Big Bossman match was a normal opener. Ken Shamrock Billy Gunn match was okay nothing special. Luna Sable just funny to see Sable beat Luna with leather. X-pac Gangrel not to good. Rock Mankind great the ending was lacking something (realism?) but a nice no rules match. Royal Rumble No more then 6 men in the ring at once and if there were they all got thrown out fast. All togther the only match that was below my expectations was the Rumble.
1,Terrible,"The Rock vs. Mankind was the only good match on the show. Everything else was worthless. The Rumble was absolutely terrible. If you want The Rock vs. Mankind, order a comp, don't waste your money on this."
4,good card,"this was a great ppv it had rock vs mankind the rumble it had bossman vs road dogg, billy gunn vs shamrock this tape is worth the buy"
3,A good but not classic rumble,"The 1999 Royal Rumble had only 2 great matches but were worth the purchase: The Rumble match and the ""I quit"" match. the rock vs mankind ""I quit"" match had NO parts of boredom anywhere in the match, an extremely well fought match that will stay in rumble history forever. Most people were disappointed in vince mcmahon winning the 1999 royal rumble, however I thought it was great. I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE FACT THAT VINCE MCMAHON DIDN'T GO ON TO WRESTLEMANIA XV TO FACE THE ROCK!!!! THE WWF TOTALLY SCREWED UP ROYAL RUMBLE TRADITION WITH THIS!!!! The rumble match was OK, not a classic. If your only a hardcore WWF fan, buy this."
3,Get for the Foley/Rock match!,"For those of you that have the movie ""Beyond the Mat"", you should get this video. It serves as a nice complement to the Royal Rumble Foley/Rock scenes from Beyond the Mat to the actual Foley/Rock match.As far as the tape itself, when not viewed in the context of ""Beyond the Mat"" --- I still say get it for the Foley/Rock match. The rest of the show pretty much paled in comparison to the show-stealing brutal match the two had. This was during the latter part of the WWF's Vince Russo - Ed Ferrera ""We're Not About Wrestling Anymore"" era, which came under tremendous criticism from wrestling fans everywhere. The product has changed significantly enough for the better since then.I would get this video along with ""Beyond the Mat""... they go very well together."
3,I QUIT IS A COOL KIND OF MATCH!,"A good ppv with an I Quit MAtch for the ttile, where Mankind and The Rock make history again! The Royal Rumble was average,and there is four titles decided in this 3 hour show! It is pretty good!"
3,WWF Royal Rumble 1999,"The year kicks off with the Royal Rumble PPV, with a few added variations - the $100,000 bounty on Austin, Vince and Chyna as Rumble participants, and an 'I quit' match between Rock and Mankind. Unfortunately what looks interesting on paper, played out like an episode of Raw Is War...too much story-telling and little in the way of in-ring action. Entertaining at best, but doesn't justify the price tag. Why not watch the latest edition of Raw?"
3,"Pretty good, but not worth buying","This PPV was alright, but it could have been better. I thought the undercard was okay, nothing special. I hate it when the WWF shortens the actual Royal Rumble match because they run out of time, which is what happened here. The Rock vs. Mankind was definitely the highlight of the tape."
1,worst royal rumble of all time,"ohhh man!!i dont know how 2 start but ill tell u this when i order a royal rumble i dont wanna see only one superstar. that was my beef with this on. i wanna look at the rumble and what i get in change austin, austin, austin, austin. everywhere from getting beat down in the back to coming back in the ammo. the rock vs mankind was not worth 30dollars the sunday night heat match was better than that. an i quit match. the reason why it made a 1 in my book cause i liked the shamrock and billy gunn match thats all.12/12/02"
1,very boaring,This was really boaring. I mean please the I quit match was so stupid. X-pac showed a porr impression and billy gunn did not even look hurtIt was just boaring. Even the rumble stunk. It had no taste. I would rent it before ever thinking about buying it
2,greg cheatle is right,SICK I QUIT MATCH I LIKE THE END THE DDT ON CONCRETE AND HIM FALLING ON THE ELECTRIC STUFF THE PEOPLE'S ELBOW ON THE CHAIR. MICHAEL COLE IS THE GAYEST ANNOUNCER EVER I HATE HIM SO MUCH NO LOL FOR ME
3,4,"This was ok. I loved The I Quit Match, no boredom! But The Royal Rumble ummm..... [was bad] because they spend the whole time trying to push eachother over the top rope. The 2000 and 2001 and 2002 Rumbles were all better."
1,Don't Buy It,"I can truly say that this products doesn't work. I have silky wavy fine hair and I am a hair food junkie so I used a lot of things, but this don't work. Usually anything can tame my hair but all this conditioner do is make it hard, matted, and tangled. Carol Daughter's products may work for some, but it hasn't work for anyone in my family and we all have different hair textures."
5,wonderful product from a wonderful company,There is a wonderful story of how Carol's Daughter came into being. This product is great for my 4 year old daughter's kinky hair. Transracial families will love this weekly treatment.
1,Works horribly.,I bought this from Sephora. It left my hair a greasy mess. And I have dry coarse hair. It was very greasy and didn't rinse out well at all.
2,Who is this book for?,"This book covers many of the same topics as a typical course or textbook in Finite Math--sets, functions, probability, systems of equations, matrices, linear programming, etc.--but from a very theoretical mathematical approach. The writing style is that of a mathematician: formal definitions, theorems, proofs, and lots of math symbols. So I can't imagine this book being very accessible to anyone but a math major.Non-mathematicians looking for a Finite Math book would be better off with one of the many more modern textbooks out there. (For what it's worth, when I've taught Finite Math to college freshmen/sophomores, I've used the text by Howard Rolf.) Math geek types, on the other hand, might appreciate this book, and they'd likely learn a thing or two from it; but they'd probably be better off with books specifically devoted to the individual subjects such as linear algebra, probability, set theory, etc."
4,Much deeper than Freud,"Fascinating book. The world of dreams and how they relate to Archetypes and Collective Unconsciousness goes much deeper than Freud's ideas of personal unconsciousness, repression, and sexual instinct as the main hallmark of psychiatric problems. Jung and the author's explanations about the Primordality of Self and the beauty as well as complexity of archaic ancestoral influence on our dreams make quite sense and seems to coincide with evolutionary perspective of behavior, including dreaming. I was going thus to rate the book with five stars until I read the last two chapters of the book. There, the author, becomes adventurous and somewhat careless and attempts to generalize his theories beyond what is known. He gets somewhat grandiose and thinks that he can now solve the problems of the modern humanity and the Earth. This sometimes happen to authors or theoreticians who are overtaken by their views. Overall, a book well woth reading."
2,An Infomercial that YOU Have to Pay For,"Like his other books, this offers some information, but is woefully shy on useable details except when it comes to the ""Schneider Approach."" For approximately $40,000 Jerome will set you up in little known jurisdiction like Vanuatu or Nauru in a bank that will cost you plenty. The question is, what can you do with it? For the vast majority of offshore investors, an offshore bank is very expensive and only useable for those who want to conduct actual global banking business. Translation - If you are an international banker with an experienced team, a correspondent bank and millions of $ behind you, a bank makes sense. For all others, it probably doesn't.I have found many better books on the market for those who are looking to venture offshore."
1,Infomercial,"I have reviewed another book by the same author. This book is in many respects similar to his other book: interesting concepts, but long on hype, questionable facts, and questionable tax advice -- short on implementation. I am definitely in favor of the concept of private bank ownership; this is simply not the book to buy to learn how to get one up and operating. The author leads you down the path to his consulting firm. Resist temptation; instead, ask your own accountant and attorney for a referral to those with a history of specializing in international taxation and commerce. They in turn will interface with the appropriate professional in the jurisdiction of choice."
3,0,"I think the book is helpful if you are in a early stage of setting up a offshore bank and need more information about different jurisdictions and examples of bank operations.The book is rather out of date when it comes to some jurisdictions though. The most interesting jurisdiction today (if you ask me), Republic of Montenegro, with only USD10K in capital requirement is not mentioned at all.I have already set up a Montenegro bank of my own (through...) and the irony is that this book is promoted from that site."
3,ok for a first read into offshore banking,"The writer gives alot of stories, and not alot of how to ddo it. Some of the information will get you thinking, that is thekey aat first for anyone looking to protect themselves from an financial collector.Key with this book is to read it with an open mind, get a note book and write down the things that get you thinking. There is not much on the how to open accounts, compaines, etc. The back of the book does have a list of banks and where they are locted. I called some when I got the book to make sure the #'s names etc were up to date and real. Alot turned out to be nothing. No need to call.All in all, it is an ok book for a first read. It will not cover ALL you need to know about offshore banking, but it will get you thinking."
3,Not a step-by-step guide,"Mr. Schneider is a consultant, therefore it is not his interest to disclose all secrets and ""catches"" on offshore Banking. If you don't have the slightest ideia of how your own bank can be useful, if it's legal, where or what are the best jurisdictions, etc, this book is ok."
1,"There is nothing ""new"".","This is the first time in I life I thought of returning a book I got online. A lot of bla-bla, but the real information in this book, is ZERO, if you are really after a how-to book. To my humble opinion what the title creates as expection from this book and what actually this book could offer are several miles apart.Thanks,Spiros,MEng, MSc, MMath"
1,Buyer Beware,I placed the order; they cancelled the product; they charged my credit card anyway. It was WAY more inconvenient to sort out credit than it needed to be. No more Plow & Hearth for me.
4,Excelent for the Begining singer,"I am a college student who is majoring in music, this book is one of the first ones that I bought for my singing library and I think it is an excelent book for any one just starting out with singing or even if you have been singing for a while and you want a good musical theater anthology. I started out using this book when I was in tenth grade and I still use it regularly. A great book with alot of variety."
2,Vol. 2 is better,"The musical selection in this volume are okay, but I much prefer the songs in Volume 2- they are better by far."
4,Good book,"Book was in good condition and everything worked out fine with mail, delivery and the like. Nice job to all."
3,Religions of the World,"The book was in good shape however, I did NOT receive the CD that was to accompany it. I was disappointed in that."
1,The Mind of a Pocket Calculator,"Typical of many academic types, Hopfe explains away that which he has no experience with. In this instance, it results in a lifeless mind explaining away world religions, one by one. E.g. the first sentence in the introduction is Webster's definition of religion. One would gather the impression that world religions were the result of a manufacturing process - one similar to the manner in which this book is written - with all the truth and sensitivity of a .45 caliber handgun. If what you want is a kind of macabre vivisection, I suggest Stephen King - he's much better."
5,Good Book for An Introduction To Religions,"I have been using Hopfe's book since the fourth edition, and I have found it to be very useful and reliable in my classes. The book shows an awareness of the nuances relevant to the various topics (including definition, contra the claim by a previous reviewer who didn't seem to read past the first page) and Woodward's updating and website keep the book up to date. Yes, the glossary could be more extensive, but I tend to work from the book and not just within the confines of the book (as I'm sure the other reviewer does as well), so this is not a serious impediment. Many more terms are defined in the text than appear in the glossary. A nice little book."
5,Link Wray is a legend for a reason,"Link Wray is one of those masters of deception. he makes it look (sound?) sooo easy. he's not playing thousands of notes a second or playing mixolydian runs over 13/8 time signatures while breathing fire.what he does (did?) is play rock'n'roll guitar better than anyone else ever has. not to take away from chuck berry, but link wray does it ALL with his six strings. he don't need words. he just plugs that axe in and rips.i swear, it's just freaky how ... and majestic he makes it all sound. the only other musicians i've heard that can make so much of so little are Miles Davis and Chet Baker.i guess when you really know the right notes to play, you ain't got to play a whole lot of 'em.every time i hear link, i just wanna run out, cover myself in tattoos, grab some cheap beers and go drag-racing."
2,Ugh...,"This book is poorly written. The author has a very poor style, with almost no ""descriptions"". He tells you the story, he doesn't show it to you. In addition, it seems as though the book is about sex scenes and the rest is fluff just to support them. Do not buy this book. Not worth it."
5,Surprisingly Good,"There was a point several minutes into this movie that I was beginning to sense that this was going to be a well crafted, casted, acted, directed and scripted action movie (unusual for Southern China productions) unlike any I had seen previously. With it's surreally engaging visuals such as falling rain, umbrellas in Macau streets, blowing paper, falling leaves, cloud darkening moon, flashes of gunfire then to have all that accompanied by precise sound effects, sublime music alternating with periods of silence, melting into a visually surreal story. Further, when adding the loss of memory storyline it became reminiscent of Dark City, Blade Runner and some early Sergio Leone westerns.A criticism is that some of the shooting scenes (perhaps intended) seemed a bit comical or spoofy."
3,Dumb & Dumber....,"A wannabe ripoff of better made Charles Bronson & Clint Eastwood movies. Other reviewers like this movie but this one is for the ""Dumb & Dumber"" crowd very definitely!"
2,Acting isn't very good,Action movies aren't platforms for oscar worthy performances but this was just bad acting. I couldn't finish it. I thought the excessive violence would cover for the poor acting but it was just too much to bear.
4,Easily one of the best films of the genre,"I Loved the action, the intensity and the scenery. This movie packed a good punch with solid acting and action scences."
1,"Drawn out monologues, cliche, and anti-climatic all the way till the end","Is it a comedy, action movie, or what? From the beginning, the dialogue goes from corny to cheesy, which depicts the rest of the film. 2 hours wasted! No more time needs to go into this waste of a so-called movie."
2,"Unless you're into Johhny To movies, don't waste your time with this drivel.","At first it looked promising, about 20 minutes into the viewing I clicked it off, it lacks any dialog and script, the direction takes too long to make sense of anything, it seems this director is more interested in what he wants and what he likes, each scene takes way too long and drawn out, at one point I was shouting to the tube, get on with it already! don't get me wrong , it has lots of style, but in my opinion, way too much style, this director seems full of himself...like I said if you are a Johnny To fan, of course your going to like it, but I, like millions o f people out there, do not know who Johnny To was, I gave him a chance, will not give him a chance again."
4,70's Garage Rockin',"Love songs with attitude that totally rock! Originally released in 1977, this debut has excellent production. They followed-up with a few albums in the early 80's and singer John Felice released a solo album in the late 80's--all of which have less attitude and are a little more pop. How's this for an obscure reference: sounds like early Skrewdriver (All Skrewed Up/Boots and Braces), sans megalomania, with Mick Jaggar singing. Should appeal to fans of the Ramones, B-Movie Rats, Supersuckers."
1,Thank you for opening my eyes Mr. Konrad,"Thank you Mr. Konrad, for opening eyes, to knowing that I am bisexual, and that my ways are ungodly... Thank you for opening my eyes to know that I am free from that tyranny, and that you bigotry is what makes the church the way it is today...Thank you for making me laugh! Yes, I am not so honest now, am I? Well guess what? It's NO ONE's business what people do in their life! I am a Satanist, but I am not doing this as a spiteful way at getting to the Christian! NO! I am doing this for my friends who are gay and like me, bisexual! It is disgusting that people think books like these are ""Awesome!"" or ""The Truth!"" YOU DO NOT KNOW THE TRUTH IF YOU BELIEVE IN THIS BS DIAREHA OF THE MOUTH! Konrad only cares about one thing, the Church of the Allcontrolled! People like you Konrad, make me sick!Pride in Satan!"
1,Myth of Gay-Straight dichotomy,"Bisexuality is hinted at in other reviews, but it's worth repeating. The idea that one must be either gay or straight is a myth. While it is true that some people, possibly even a majority, have only opposite-sex or same-sex attraction, many people are bisexual, and have a mix of opposite-sex and same-sex attraction. Forcing our cookie-cutter ""Gay or Straight"" categories on these people makes it even more difficult for them to realize their identity.Of course a person can cling desperately to his (I say ""his"" because the title singles out males) opposite-sex attraction and call himself ""Straight."" Whether he is happy doing this depends on his ability to mask his true feelings.But please don't confuse the varying shades of bisexuality with those who have only same-sex attraction, who we call ""gay."" This book does exactly that, with disastrous consequences."
1,Is this serious?,"This is disgusting. I am absolutely mortified this book is still condoned in this day and age. If you're gay, accept it and be gay. It's 2011, it's perfectly FINE to be gay, you were born that way!"
2,the sexual truth has arrived...,"The author said he first had a crush on a girl and found the idea of kissing a boy ""disgusting."" He was never gay to begin with, but he made money the easy way - claiming to be an ex-gay for pay. But, really, who says gays can't change? Every science-based medical association and the ex-gay leaders themselves. Google Exodus admits gays can't change"
4,Bob's opinion,"The important thing about a slipper is comfort. These fitted perfectly and were ""as comfortable as an old shoe"" as soon as I put them on.Looks are second in importance and these look very good. They are the sort of slipper that do not look out of place as being too casual when friends drop by.I am very happy with them."
5,Hush Puppies Slippers,These were a gift; the recipient reports that they fit well and are holding up nicely. These slippers have timeless good looks.
4,excellent product,"I wold like to say this is an exceptional product as this would have been the third pair in several years I've ordered, however this time my order could not be filled ... bummer. Still a good product."
3,Neutral on this one,"Not really seeing any effects with usage of 1 bottle, cannot justify repurchasing at the price point for hair, got it cause someone gave it rave reviews after using it a few times (1 bottle) - went back to much cheaper organic trader joes brand, much happier."
2,( 2 1/2 stars) Forte is too intellegent,"to convincingly pull off the gangster/thug thing/crap and it shows on his next CD ' I, John' which is definately money better spent. Brother, I hope time flys and we hear from you soon."
5,A great adventeristic novel!!!,"One of the best Hardy Boys novels. Joe suddenly loses his memory from a head injury and now thinks that his brother is his enemy. There's nothing more to say except to read this excellent novel!! Find out the whole situation on this story, you won't be disappointed!"
1,horrible,this is one of the dumbest books i have ever read.yeah the Hrady brothers fight the entire book. do not read it.
2,Advertising,"Its not Amazon that writes the product descriptions, its the manufacturer. Your ""review"" should be of the product itself, not the advertising!********This product is a lot of extra work for nothing. You'd get the same results with a teflon pan and some toothpicks."
2,Exciting Narrative,"For a book which ambitiously sets out to present a ""revealatory history"" it ends up being a travelogue replete with personal impressions derived from expeditions in the region. The author is outspoken in his insightful views and sympathies in his ground-zero perspective of the cynical exploitation of people's movements and struggles in the region. The book is far from being a well-balanced, carefully researched treatment of the conflicts in the region.The author employs a very highly effective narrative writing style which makes for a racy reading, interspersing interpretations of history and religion with descriptions of natural scenery, and bloodiness of war. However, the book lacks a certain flow and the reader comes away with a feeling that the book has been put together from a series of features/articles as evidenced by the repititiveness in several parts."
1,"Poor, error-prone example of 'speedy journalism'","This is a great book - if you know next to nothing about the region. Margolis's text is full of errors, forceful opinions, and sloppy prejudice. Which is a pity, because this book will, no doubt, be widely read and seen, by some, as authoritative. Overall, this book has been panned by reviewers who know and work on the region. Ask yourself if this is just a case of sour grapes at a journalist whose quick take sells well, or valid concerns about a book that simply doesn't get to grips with the conflicts he looks at, takes too much of a geopolitical view, and fails to check his facts."
1,Pathetically researched and biased book,The author obviously has travelled a lot but really doesn't understand the politics or culture of the region. He makes absurd claims in the book with no supporting evidence. It reads more like a James Bond adventure for the author than good journalism. He pretty much takes a single point of view and constantly hammers it instead of providing both sides of the coin. In his world everyone but the islamic militants are at fault.
2,"Biased writing, not much depth or knowledge fo India",Eric does not have much depth knowledge of India or its traditions or cultural nuances. The book almost seeems to be the views of Pakistani propaganda machine. Most Indians reading this book would be very dismissive of the condescending attitute of the attitude of Mr. Margolis towards India.His speaking of circumcision and that Indians thinking of Muslims as sexually robust shows the stupidity of analysis used in writing about peoples and racial prejudices prelavant through out. Not a very scholarly work.
3,"interesting, but biased","I found the book interesting, particularly descriptions of various characters the author is said to have met. The book also does well in bringing forward the plight of ""forgotten"" victims of various conflicts. However, the author shows a definite bias against India, and his actual experiences with Indians are rarely mentioned. This bias might leave any reader capable of independant thought a little uncomfortable with the authenticity of the facts presented here."
1,Rubbish........,Read some of the authors previous work and wasn't impressed with his work on this book as usual. He does not show a sense of understanding of the region - portrays a typical one-sided view on the region. I'm surprised that he continues to write on this topic.Makes bad reading and misinforms readers who are trying to get a good understanding of the region.
1,Completely Lacking In Credibility,"This is the same man who wrote on March 31:""Iraqis, very clearly, do not want to be 'liberated...""""...suggest that a long guerilla war may be in the offing...""""This does not bode well for the upcoming US attack on Baghdad.""Anyone can call themself an analyst."
1,Biased...,"Eric Margolis ...basically takes one small group's point-of-view(Pakistani Pashtun) and presents it as fact. If he had the intelligence or professionalism, he would consider ALL the views of the various groups and weigh them, and realize that the truth lies somewhere in between. Unfortunately, Margolis is intent on making a name for himself as as ""expert"" on South/Central Asia, which is laughable.Like other pundits, his grasp on the truth is weak at best. His ...""analysis"" is based on his prejudices: Russia BAD, Pakistan, Saudis GOOD. Shame on the Toronto Sun and others for giving this ...a public platform."
1,Disappointingly biased,"I have been a reader of Eric Margolis since my university days - over a decade ago. I bought the book and passed it on to my father. Ignore the glowing, positive reviews. Either they have not read the book, or their personal biases (Margolis is rightly perceived as an apologist for Islamic fundamentalism) prevent an accurate assessment. The book makes for interesting reading, but is full of inaccuracies and a strange bias - Margolis comes across as very bigoted against Indians (specifically Hindus) and is told from the basic point of view of a Pakistani army officer or Mujahedin, who Margolis homo-erotically fawns over.Margolis' 'sympathy' for Pakistan clouds his ability to offer informed analysis. As it is, the book is mere propaganda for the theocratic state of Pakistan.I'll still keep reading Margolis because he's amusing - but not because I feel that he's providing me with objective views, researched and conclusions supported by critically examined evidence."
5,This is Eric's insight which is usually deep and wide,"For those who want to understand Afghanistan, Kashmir and the background of the conflict there this book is a ""must read""."
4,Information I haven't found in many other places,"I found the book quite enjoyable, and with information I haven't seen or heard of before. I agree that the author did show some slight bias against the indians, but it was nothing more then any other political book I've ever read. As far as the book itself, it was non-stop reading, I couldn't put it down. Very interesting, and a very interesting author. I would love to hear more of Margolis's adventures."
2,Delta diverter,"Ordered Delta RP17730 diverter valve from original 6/5/02 installation guide #32922. Part was not a replacement for the installed assembly diverter valve, Delta model 2653; it did not fit and was made differently from original. Replaced whole 3-valve assembly with Moen. Tossed the replacement part."
3,Unfortunate sizing!,We were only given the option of choosing a JACKET size for this suit! And...the jacket fit beautifully! Unfortunately the pants were ridiculously small! Such a gorgeous suit and price!But had to send the whole thing back! I'm BUMMED!
4,Great Item but not super durable,This set only lasted for about 2 years. I bought another set of the same model to replace them because they were pretty much perfect. After 2 years they started to lose connection after hanging up from a phone call..
3,Phonex Easy Jack 2,"This is a very easy to use and install extension telephone jack for a room or location without one. Just plug it in and go. I bought it to use with a fax machine in a location that did not have a telephone jack. Remember to read the instruction booklet that comes with the unit. If you have a DSL on the same phone line, you MUST use a DSL filter for the telephone line or you cannot use the line for telephone or data transmission such as a fax. The fax will transmit slowly, but it will transmit. The sound quality is identical to a standard telephone."
3,Addition phone phone jack 2,"If you place a order for Easy Jack 2 Extension Unit for PX-212. Make sure you already own the base. You can not buy the base along. you have to already own a system, which is the unit and base together. This is a extra unit. Amazom was veryunderstaning about this. I was able to download a label. And all I had to do was drop it off at a UPS drop box. I already receive a e-mail, so I can track the package going back to Amazon. They said I would receive a full refund."
1,Miss lead,Was miss lead on this product only revived one extension not two for it to work. Buyer be were...!
3,Returned,This was not what I needed and you graciously accepted my returning it. Ordered what I needed and works fine.
1,does not work,the item was advertised that you could plug it into an electrical outlet and use it as a phone jack for your cable or satellite box. It does not receive a dial tone and did not come with any other receiver pieces. I am sorry that I purchased the product and am still paying an extra $5 a month to my satellite provider.
1,Now it works later it does not work,"Hooked up the device and all worked well for about 2-3 weeks. Then my home telephone system stopped working. The line was dead. Called the ATT repairman. Trouble was that the device stopped working and was interfering with the phone line, basically shorting it out. After disconnecting the device, the phone system at home worked well. You be the judge."
1,Worthless Product,I purchased 2 of these to go along with a base unit & extension combo kit (the combo kit works great!). These do not work at all. I purchased them as they were supposed to be compatible with the Easy Jack 2 PX-211 I purchased. The product is labeled as a model PX-211 but does not pair with the base unit. I am attempting to return the produce (32 days from time of order). I would not recommend this at all! They are still selling this product on the amazon web site!
1,Not worth it,Satellite outlets do not work very far from base unit and the system causes phones to ring occasionally for no reason.
1,It' not really what it says it is....,"Please be aware the web site indicates this item can extend a telephone connection. However, it is a ""data only"" extension and is not compatible as a telephone extension. Amazon folks were more than friendly in providing a refund, but the web information needs to be corrected and highlighted this is only for data and not voice extension."
2,Not working with Phonex System,"Ordered Phonex PX-211 base unit, I needed another extension jack, ordered a PX-212 and got a Philips PX211D, Hooks up to Base unit but gets errors."
3,"Hey, it's still the Dead Boys","It's been reissued by Cheetah Crome as ""Third Generation Nation"" but this is the original 2nd Dead Boys Lp, in the correct order (no bonus tracks though). The first album is brilliant, definative punk rock, this ain't the first album. Both the songwriting and production are noticably weak, however, it's still the Dead Boys and that makes it better than your average band. Buy this Lp for ""Aint It Fun"" and ""Son Of Sam"" if for no other reason, these two are undeniably killer punkrock tunes in a slow-but-mean-and-cruel way."
3,Dead Boys,"Gotta say, this album is definitely not as strong as ""Young, Loud and Snotty."" The attitude is missing as is the Raw Power. Some excellent songs with potential, had they been recorded properly."
3,"sophomore slumpin, still not terrible tho","yeah it's nowhere near as dope as young, loud and snotty but it's not the worst record ever. i mean, just stiv's 'accent' or whatever makes it totally worth a few spins, and since they only have a few records you kinda have to get them all. if you're reading this you probably already have young/loud/snotty so just know not to expect the pimposity of sonic reducer, i want lunch, or hey little girl. ya know. whatever."
3,classic punk rock oversite,"OK,this isn''t as perfect as YLand S,but still worth it.Calling on You,Big City,and Dead or Alive are very strong classic Dead Boys material.Felixx Pappalardi essentially killed this band with this record,trying to tone down their sound to appeal to a wider audience.Cleaner,quieter guitar mix is ill suited to this band and led to bad blood between producer and band during the recording.Check out Younger,Louder and Snottier to hear how the Dead Boys should sound.A remix of We Have Come is sorely needed.Remember that Punk was viewed as a threat to the industry establishment;this is a classic case of sonic sabotage.There are some forgotten gems on this widely dismissed album."
1,Safety Hazard--Glass Cover Fell While in Use,"I just reported this product to the Consumer Product Safety Commimssion. We have a few of these bulbs on the ceiling and the glass cover of one bulb and the metal ring holding the glass cover simply fell from the ceiling this evening and the glass was splashed all over the floor. Ironically, the bulb was still on, but without the glass cover. I would have expected a bulb to go out at some point, but would never have expected the glass cover to fall off. It seems that the metal ring stretched under the halogen heat and thus fell with the glass cover. It seems that the product is seriously defective and poses a safety hazard."
5,works as needed,I used it to connect a Garmin GPS unit to my Mac while running Parallels to update the Garmin database - worked fine.
1,Sabrent SBT-USC1K - worthless,"I bought this unit and a Sabrent SBT-USC6M (the six foot unit)to connect to routre console ports. Neither would work on a Dell Inspiron 1525 with Windows Vista Home Premium. After researching the problem and trying various things I contacted Sabrent by email and they emailed me a Vista installer for the device, which by the way I could not find on the Sabrent site. I ran it and the device installed - once - it ceased functioning and the install package will not re-install the drivers. I have wasted eight hours on this and now I am returning both units and am going to try the Best Buy unit that another reviewer had success with. Yes - Vista has problems - but this is unacceptable for a product in the market today. Sabrent should either MAKE SURE they have drivers that install and stay working or should either not sell these devices or at least provide a strong caveat that the devices have problems with Vista."
1,USB to Serial Adapter cable,I purchased 2 of the USB to Serial Adapter cables and it never works. You able to see that there is a Comm port in the device manager but when you try to link with the device has no communication. I tried in different computers still doesn't work. It was a waist of money. Not even worth to sent it back because I had to pay for the shipment. I end up buying another USB to serial cable in a store instead of online. Don't buy this product.
1,Didnt work for me,I bought this cable to program 8051 microcontrollers with and it didn't work for that application. I did not try it with anything else. I returned the cable.
1,Don't order this item. It would be at least 30 days before you get it.,"This item should be listed as temporarily unavailabe. The listing says it might take an extra day to ship. My confirmation says to expect to wait at least a month. If I didn't need it now, I wouldn't have ordered it."
1,Just did not work..,"I bought this product to use to connect my laptop to the serial output of an interface box connected to the diagnostic connector on my motor home. It simply did not work in this application. Although the computer could ""see"" the cable after the driver was installed the data rate was ridiculously slow; Almost nil. Changing the driver was of no help. I finally went up to the local Best Buy and bought the only comparable product in the store. Pluged it in and it worked perfectly with the already installed drivers. Sometimes you get what you pay for. Not recommended."
1,DO NOT BUY IT,"I bought 10 of this cables for me and some friends. I installed and verified the port and it appeared in hardware with no problems but when I try to use it, it makes nothing, I expended like 8 hours trying to make it work but I could not, I changed the com1, 2, etc, I installed the new driver from the product site, I also installed it in different computers with different windows versions and it did not work. I read comments like this and I thought it will not hapen to me. Do not buy it.I have been buying in amazon over 5 years and this is the first article that disappointment me."
4,Easy-to-use adapter for connecting a GPS,"Like other reviewers, I bought this so I could attach my Garmin eTrex Legend GPS to my new computer, which doesn't have a serial port. The mini CD that came with it had the driver and a brief user manual. The manual said to install the driver before connecting the adapter, but I didn't read it so I did things in reverse order. (No problem.) The driver on the CD worked fine, though Windows XP MCE complained about it.Pros: MUCH cheaper than Garmin's adapter, but just as functionalCons: Old/non-Windows-compliant driver, no mention of proper order of installation on packaging (on CD)"
4,Sabrent - USB / serial cable - DB-9 (M) - 4 pin USB Type A (M) - 1 ft,Worked just fine connecting my Magellan Meridian GPS to my new laptop that doesn't have a serial port. The driver installation and setup was easy. (windows xp on a compaq)
2,Isn't recongized by devices,"I purchased this item to allow me to connect my Garmin GPS to my notebook computer with a Garmin serial data cable. The cable works fine with my desktop computer that has a built-in serial port. The USB to Serial device driver installes and Windows recongizes that a new com port is installed. However, when you attach any device to the new serial port, it does not work. I tried it with my Garmin as well as an external modem.I haven't researced the manufacturer's web site (if they have one) for updates, KB, etc."
3,Didn't work for my purpose,"I bought this because I needed a serial port in order to program Atmel AVR microcontrollers, and this one was cheap. It was recognized just fine in XP, and the included drivers installed easily, but I haven't been able to get it to work for what I bought it for, despite a lot of fiddling with drivers and settings."
1,Didn't work in my application,"I needed a USB to Serial adapter for a serial cable I use for programming a PLC. A new laptop I got has no serial port, and the cable I use is not available with a USB connector. Unfortunately, this cable did not work with the programming cable. I have since tried another cable and that one didn't work either. The search continues..."
1,Did not work with Magellan Meridian Gold,"We bought this product in order to connect a Magellan Meridian Gold to the USB port on our laptop. It came with no instructions and a small installation disk. After installing the product to the best of our ability, no connection was ever made to the GPS. We have since given up and are transferring files between the laptop and the GPS using an SD card (works flawlessly)."
4,Lionel Fastrack remote switch,"This is the ninth remote switch I've purchased, and it had the same problem as the others. The rotating position light module does not snap on firmly. It falls off and in all but one switch, rolls around in the box. To remedy this problem, with a tooth pick, I add just s small dab of silicon adhesive on one edge to hold it in place. (Don't let the adhesive get on the rotating shaft or LED.) Doing this, I have the option of pulling it off later, and repositioning the red signal lens. Other than that, this product is excellent and performs as Lionel describes.My great-grandkids (4 to 9) have learned a lot about a train's movement from these switches."
5,issues resolved!,"The lot number was incorrect and at first the wrong size paper arrived. Samy's Camera authorized the return and then special ordered the correct product to fill my original order. They then over-nighted the shipment and honored the advertised price of course. Thank you, and I would do business again."
4,101 Salon Promotions,This book is very exciting and very creative! The ideas shared are simple to do and fun as well. I can't imagine any salon without it!
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT,"Could not find vanilla malt anywhere. This stuff is what legends were made of and kids today dont know anything about it. ""Malt Shops"" were all the rage for decades and now mostly forgotten.The only domestic mfr of this malt makes it only in chocolate which does not work for anything but chocolate. If you want vanilla, strawberry or any other flavor malt you have to have VANILLA!Im really happy to have found this source."
2,Good but seriously over priced,"I can buy twice the size of this container at my local Indian grocery store for half the price. This container was ridiculously small and was over within a week. For $9,xx this is highly over priced. Buy it locally."
3,Great taste but gritty in cold drinks,I used this for milkshakes and it was very gritty. In milkshakes this may not be the answer. I also used it in hot chocolate there it worked very well but in cold dont waste your time.
2,A fine table... if you're a midget,"The Exotic Retreat cabinet that accompanies this coffee table is a nice piece of inexpensive furniture. The end table, while a bit narrow, is also nice. This coffee table, though? It's small. Like, ridiculously small. As if it were made for a child.Don't get me wrong... if it were bigger, it would be fine. It's not ugly. Just extremely short (and not as wide as I expected). So much so that, after assembling it this morning, I'm debating between either returning it or figuring out a way to add about three or four inches to the height. In my opinion, one really shouldn't have to do extensive customization to a Target coffee table.Definitely not what I expected. If you have a tiny living room, this might be fine for you. But when you're thinking about buying it, pay special attention to the height, because as it turns out, a table that's only 14"" high looks pretty silly."
3,Cool design but overpriced,"I like this table it is an unusual piece that commands attention but in person it is obvious it is not made of wood. This should really cost around $40-60. It seems very sturdy and it is lower to the ground than other tables, which is what I wanted but for others just pay attention to the dimensions before ordering. It really does draw the eye, meaning it will be noticed when entering a room I just wish it was solid wood and not particle board. I am very picky but I am still glad I purchased this it is a cool looking design but it won't be confused for something extravagantly pricey, though it could if it was real wood and bamboo. Also, it is much darker in person than in the picture, very close to black. I would highly recommend this to a friend who lives in an apartment or dorm or for a basement rec room or mancave but for a house's living/family room you might want to look for something a little nicer. Hope this review helped."
5,golf mat review,I've hit a couple thousand balls off of it and it still looks like new ..... a very good value.
4,A great book with something for all audiences,"The Art and Science of Butterfly Photography is a well thought out book which should appeal to anyone interested in butterfly photography. For the amateur Lepidopterist, the book contains a wealth of practical information on photographic techniques. For the amateur photographer, the book contains great information on the specific challenges of butterfly photography, as well as basic butterfly behavior -- where to find them, how to attract them, etc. Even someone new to both butterflies and photography should find all that they need to start taking outstanding pictures almost immediately. I am an amateur Lepidopterist with a basic knowledge of 35mm photography. I have read a number of general nature photography books, but they tend to focus on larger animals and landscapes which present very different challenges than photographing butterflies. This book was just what I have been looking for!"
1,No Map Updates Available for this product,I have one of these in my motor coach and have found out there are no map updates available. The maker of the maps won't sell it to you and Panasonic has discontinued the product and all map updates.
4,Very nice Unit,"I bought this unit about a month ago but never had time to install it until just recently, I have to admit, this unit was hard as hell to install, so many wires... I had to get a friend to help me out and it took us about 5 hours to get everything working right, but once it's ready, boy is it something? I own a 2004 WRX and it just looks so amazing and the GPS is so accurate... One advice though, you might want to get a more powerful battery than the OEM one since it DOES demand a bit of power"
4,Its was worth 599,"Panasonics new navi is cool exept sometimes on the freeway gps thinks im driving on the street paralelle to freeway. Very annoying but it not very common. I also dont like that theres no remote. N that i cant watch a dvd on the monitor while playing the ipod, its 1 or the other unlike alpine."
1,Horrible Support,"I unfortunately also purchased this product and ran into the same problems the previous review spoke of. But on top of that they advertise Ipod Video capability. Well that cable was originally not even released yet; model CAVDC300U make sure you get the model with V in it or it will have problems with the Video Ipod. I accidentally bought the wrong one because that was the only cable available at that time last week the correct cable was available. I reordered it taking a lost and installed it today. Still it does not support video, called Panasonic customer care was told that I need a firmware update that isn't available to consumers at this time and there will be no ETA when one would become available. Customer support was horrible bounced around over 8 times and hold time of over 30 mins. Avoid yourself the headache. This unit could have been great but just Panasonic's poor planning killed it."
2,Adequate but lacking,The Panasonic CN-NVD905U In-Dash Nav System is adequate but is not what I would consider user friendly. It will navagate you through city streets when it would be faster and easier to use the highway. I also find the processes cumbersome and not intuitive.
5,This works well and is safe for everyone.,"After reading the other comments I decided to order and try this for my self. Afterall, the person complaining about ""no blade"" wrote his comment with out even trying it. This really does work well and I have 2 more as stocking stuffers. The main advantage is that these are safe for all ages to use and safe to store anywhere with out fear of someone accidently cutting themselves. The only disavantage I see, not really diswasher friendly I fear."
5,Wood Cuts Pizza?,Yep! Works great and does not mar pizza peel. If it gets a little ragged on the edge you can sharpen it with an emery board.
2,slicing?,"not a great slicer, but it doesn't scratch up my wonderful peel... and it serves well enough. i'll keep using it because i don't want to use a metal blade on my peel, but takes several passes to cut the pizza."
2,Check the shipping cost!,"I am concerned that there is no place during the purchase of this item that shows you that you will pay $13.45 for a piece of wood they are advertising to sell for $3.95. Nor do they tell you the shipping is will be $9.50. I had $100 of stuff in my cart, a higher price than I expected, so I removed this item and it went down to $86. Determining the difference between the two numbers was the only way I discovered the true price. I could see the cumulative price for shipping everything in my cart but I was never shown the per item shipping cost, even though it was the only item I was buying from this particular merchant.This is very deceptive and should be illegal. I am very disapointed in Amazon."
1,Simplemente malisimo / bad bad bad,"Jocelyn Brown es una de mis artistas favoritas , pero en esta ocacion su estilo se perdio , claro que mas bien es Cassius el del mal gusto , ritmo pesimo , voz fuerte pero oculta tras un monton de ruido /Bad production , regular rhythm , grant voice hiding behind a big loudA colvic"
1,Dont Look Back,Not what I expected OK but not GREAT Camera work was great but was dissappointed in the story line.It is not even close to Anthony Zimmer.
3,Middle of the Road,"I don't have a ton of experience with salt scrubs, but this product is pretty much what I'd expect of one. I have dry skin, so I use this product occasionally in the shower on my arms and legs, hoping that the oils will rehydrate me a bit and that the salt will scrub off some of the dead skin cells. I would say it's pretty mediocre for the rehydration (perhaps the ingredients are just not appropriate for that), and it's pretty much as good as you can expect for the scrubbing (it's hard to go wrong there, with sea salt as the #1 ingredient). I also occasionally use this product when giving myself a manicure or pedicure, and I'm terrifically happy with the results when doing that. My hands/feet get really nice and smooth as a result.My biggest gripe with the product is the smell: It has a pretty strong citrus smell, and the scent just doesn't work for me. For this aspect alone, I'll be trying another product next time."
1,Oily jar of salt,"This was a disappointment to me. I was excited to receive this body scrub to find that when I opened the jar, 1/4 of the oil sitting on the top just spilled all over me. I closed the jar, shook up the contents and then proceeded to the shower. The scent was nice, and the first experience with it was like digging in wet mud. The salt was coarse and a rather uncomfortable to rub on my skin. My result was very oily skin out of the shower, and not great moisturized skin later in the day. My second attempt to use this product...I shook it up and when I opened the jar, I was pretty much left with slightly denser oily salt that was highly uncomfortable to rub on my skin. It was like using coarse sea salt and a little oil. I eventually ended up mixing in my usual moisturizing body wash, which made the experience tolerable. The third time I opened the jar, it was 80% salt. Very sorry that I purchased 3 jars!!"
5,wonderful scent and great for dry skin!,"I really love this scrub! I have used many different salt scrubs and this has to be my favorite so far. The scent is amazing and the oils are great for my bone dry skin. I wish they would make a perfume that smelled like this. I agree that the granules are larger, but I think it works just as well as other finer scrubs I have used. I would also recommend buying from Amazon, since they seem to sell it at a significantly lower price than I've seen in stores."
2,grains too big,I was not too crazy about this. It is slightly greasy and the sale grains are large which I don't like on my skin.
2,I can't even open it,"This seems like some excellent body scrub, but after I removed the sealed top, I put the lid back on, and now I can't get it off. The scrub is super oily which leaks out of the container and makes it impossible to open. I have tried everything and am now stuck with a jar of good-smelling salts that I can't actually use."
3,Good product,"Good product, but nothing too much difference with other similar products. I like the smell through. The skin feels smooth after using it."
4,Can't beat Korean drama and Amazon has great selection,"There is nothing bad to say, Korean dramas, like this one are so worth the time, and money. I am now a collector and own about 14. Can't go wrong. Top notch acting really great stories. This one constantly turns and twists in the plot. It is nothing like the ones of role changing that have been done in American movies. They were stupid. This story make you laugh and cry. Constant cliff hangers and the end left me breathless. Just a wonderful story, top directing and great scenery. I love Korean drama and now rarely watch American TV or movies. Give it a try. I like buying from Amazon as I feel my purchase is guaranteed."
1,where,"I am still waiting for my purchases, it's been almost two or three months sense i purchases it.It would be nice to know were it is......"
5,This IS a widescreen version...,The product details claim the aspect ratio is 1.33:1. It is not. I received this as a gift and it was purchased directly from my Amazon wish list. I just put the DVD in and can confirm that it is absolutely a widescreen picture. I don't know what the exact aspect ratio is as it is not printed on the box. But I have a newer widescreen TV and it fills the screen.Aside from that... best show ever!
5,Secret Garden,This is the best k-drama and im so glad i bought it ^ ^ the DVD's are great quality highly recommended!
3,NOT The Concrete Cowboys From Portland Oregon!!,"This is a band that was together back in 2000, and is not in any way affiliated with The Concrete Cowboys active today in the Oregon/Washington area."
3,Lacking,I ordered this hoping that it would come with the very special spring that holds the float properly inside the carb. It did not come with this spring and I had to order it separately.
3,Slow film with great ending. Hit or miss-your choice!,"When I first saw the trailer for this film on another DVD I rented, this one piqued my interest. As a result, I rented it this weekend. This is a danish film without dubbing, but has subtitles.A man on leave from work is bored with his life and his wife, and his daughter. He decides to enroll in a test study his brother-in-law is doing with anti-depressants. The result is chaos as this man becomes totally uninhibited and does things he probably wouldn't do before, or maybe he would have. The viewer has to wait and see. It had potential, but it didn't just hit the nail on the head. It starts out very slow, boring this viewer until near the end when the story finally gets going. I'm very good at figuring ends to books and films, tv shows, etc. and I had this one figured out within the first 15 minutes. I didn't like it, but you may not. The ending is a big disappointment."
3,Psycho dad and husband,"Dreary atmosphere and a dark theme are at the core of this film. Almost all of the Danish movies I have seen are dark and tension is lurking around the corner. I guess the weather in that country inspires this sort of movie making. This is about a bored middle aged man who decides to take a leave of absence to do nothing. Then he volunteers to be a guinea pig in an experiment for mood elevating drugs. Nothing happens at first but then trouble erupts at the beginning subtly then consuming all his loved ones.I thought this was a great movie there were many scenes where I thought the tension could go a step further but it never did, a slow boil of a movie. Actors are pretty great and writing has a underlying message in it. A lot of people could identify with the identity and middle life crisis that the principal characters feels, getting rid of your obligations and family responsibilities to pursue freedom, which proves to be always elusive. Three stars. 4/18/2011"
5,Eye Opening Book,Great book! I am getting it for my friend for her birthday. I highly recommend it. :)
5,Best product,"Murine natural tears formula is the best product I've ever tried for common dry eyes. Cool, clean remoisturizing without irritating chemicals that constrict blood circulation or produce a film on the eyes."
2,Beware Apple users,"The software that comes with the printer does not support newer versions of Mac's Tiger operating system -- specifically 10.4 and later. You can download the software from the HP website (hp.com, click on software and downloads). It's a large file so if you have dial up, it will take 10 hours to download. For those of us without high-speed internet, HP Technical Support says that they do not have a CD rom with the software available for shipping. Their advice to me was: ""Find someone with high-speed internet, and download the online file onto a CD Rom."" Apparently, some stores like Best Buy and CompUSA will do it for you, for a small fee. If I had known it would be this much hassle to connect the printer to my powerbook, I never would have bought it."
1,High Price!!!!,Is this some sort of joke? $315.99??? I bought mine brand new at walmart for $75. I think there must be some mistake.
1,Brand new and its BROKEN!!!,I'm mad. I bought this one to replace my old one. This one and the other one are doing the samething. I had a chat with an HP service helper and they determined that it was broke. Their customer service is top notch thought! They are sending me a new one for free and apearently I get to keep the ink cartidges for free because of my troubles.
4,Good Buy,"So far no problems, had the printer for about 3 months now, printed about 500 pages and just ran out of ink. A good number of those pages where high quality prints. My last printer was an HP multifunction and it gave me hell, but HP took it back after 6 months and gave me 90% of my money back. So I went simple."
3,I miss my 882C.,I bought this printer to replace my trusty 882C which finally quit. It performs well enough for the price but it consistently jams when using gloss photo paper. I've given up on printing photo's with it. I'll buy a printer with a straighter paper path next time.
1,Eats ink fast,"This 3845 printer came with my HP desktop PC. The quality is fine, but it eats ink. I go thru one color cartridge for 25 pages of color photos. The black ink lasts a bit longer. do not trust the low ink warning, because you can get a few more pages after that."
2,Not a Photo Printer,"After hours of messing around with this printer, I still cannot get it to print a truly bordless 4""x6"" photo. It demands HP 4""x6"" bordless with TAB paper, I have other photo paper, and it leaves a blank white strip at the end of the photo where I assume the tab would be on HP printer. Also, the quality is no where near as good as the quality of the Canon i850 photo printer that I own.This was free with a laptop purchase I received, but I'm extremely glad I didn't buy this ""photo"" printer. I would have been very upset if I paid for this.If you don't need to print photographs, this printer would work fine. Otherwise get something else."
1,Printer doesn't work,"I selected this used printer to replace a similar printer that gave out. This printer is no better. The paper will not advance through the print heads, making the printer unusable. The HP website suggests that this condition would be not practical to correct."
2,JAMS CONSTANTLY DURING PRINTING,"I purchased this printer about a year ago, and have been wanting to write a review to warn people for most of the time I've had it. I am a stay-at-home Mom, and only use this printer for printing incidentals, like coupons or recipes (once or twice a week). I did spend a couple of days reading reviews for home printers, and decided on this one, but am still very disappointed in it, especially for a HP product. For the first couple of months, it worked fine, but ever since, it the paper jams approx. 2 out of every 3 prints. This printer is terrible, and as soon as I get the time to shop (again), I'm going to replace it."
4,owned for over a year,"I have had this for over a year, it still works well. The only complaint is it sometimes doesn't recognize that there is paper, other than that it works fine."
3,Not so good for an office,"I was forced to buy this for my desk at work because it is cheap, but as I always say, you get what you pay for. It prints out pictures, sheets of labels, and normal stuff ok but forget envelopes and single labels."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"I appreciate the clear writing style of this book, but I've found several content problems that are very frustrating to a new Visio user. The author often says to click the icon on the toolbar, but he fails to say which toolbar, leaving the reader to display and remove toolbars until the correct icon appears. I've found shortcuts that don't work as described in the book. For instance, any shortcut that begins with CTRL+O opens the Open File dialog box instead of doing what the book says. In several places the author says to click on an option on the TOOLS menu when, in fact, the option is on the SHAPE menu. While it's better than no book at all, I don't recommend this book for new Visio users."
1,Learn Microsoft Visio,"This has been the worst Amazon experience I've had to date. You sent me the wrong book. I called and told you, so you sent me a replacement. You sent me the wrong book AGAIN! I called and told you. I asked that you physically confirm that it is the correct book before sending it next time. The Customer Service person would not do so.Now I have 2 wrong books and no Learn Microsoft Visio 2002. I am expected to go on the computer and print return labels, then go to the post office and ship the stuff back. Seems to me that I am being seriously inconvenienced for your mistake."
3,Lacking,If you bought one book on tournament poker.. this would not be it. While I do believe the book contained useful information it left wanting more I do not remotely feel ready for a tournament there just is not enough insight.
1,Wait for Sklansky's upcoming book,"David Sklansky has a tournament poker book coming out in late April 2002. Though he's not the most organized writer, he knows poker very well. Also, he gives plenty of specific examples, which Suzuki fails to do.BTW, others rag on Suzuki for not being a known tournament player. The book quite clearly states that Suzuki is a pseudonym. So maybe he is a known, successful player. But this book has about 20 pages worth of content repeat ad nauseum, and precious few examples. The most non-obvious section (on the mathematics of final table negotiations) originally appeared in Sklansky's book anyway."
2,Same information over and over,"While this is a little useful info in this book, it was really not what I was looking for. It also repeats the same information several times."
2,Ever hear of Suzuki?,"Suzuki is not a well known or successful tournament player and this book will probably not help you become one either. I got my copy as a freebie, and would have been unhappy if I had paid for it.If you want to learn about or improve your tournament play, I suggest ""Tournament Poker"" by Tom McEvoy."
2,beginner book....not much depth,"I purchased this book a few months back and I must say I was a bit disappointed. A positive - if you're ""brand new"" to the idea it can be a good starting point. A negative: If you're already active it doesn't provide alot of new information or detail to the various aspects of emotions, lifestyle changes & advanced activities. I found the continual reference/plug of the magazine she writes a column in to be a little too much ""free advertisement"" for my taste. I was hoping for more information than it provided for our level of activity already established."
2,I expected more.,"I thought that being written by a woman for a woman Patti was going to elaborate into the relationship of sharing yourself and your partner with other couples and how to deal with the anxiety and expectations of first timers into ""the life-stile"". I was left with the feeling of reading an infomercial for the connections magazine. I was also disappointed Patti did not address safe sex or health issues in this book. This print is dated 2002, almost 10 years old and I feel it needs update. Most of the clubs listed are no longer in business."
3,Interesting,I enjoyed the book. I wish she would do something a little more up to date. For someone that is just getting started is a good start. I hope she does a second book.
4,"Good, but wanted more","A book that is interesting and non-lengthy enough to get thru in 2 nights. A great inside view on life as a swinger/open marriage. Had a feeling that it could be updated with more current information about what the internet has to offer, event dates, clubs, etc."
2,Not much to be learned here.,"We wanted a step further than basic information. This text does not take that step.There is no information here that can't be found on-line. You can tell by the included photos how this book reads..... tacky. Who wrote those other two reviews, Patti's mom and dad?"
5,A Concise & Informative Swingers Guide,"We really enjoyed reading Recreational Sex, the information given was very helpful toward our decision to ""join"" the lifestyle. It answered alot of questions we had, and with the information at hand it helped us avoid any embarrassing situations with our first encounter. Patti Thomas is truly the ""Queen of Swing""!"
2,Spend your money on a trip to Hedo instead,"Although the bias behind this book is well intentioned, I found its overall poor writing (and excessive use of exclamation points) to be distracting from the main point. There's little here that couldn't be figured out from some dedicated browsing of the net, and the brevity of the book is irritating given its exceedingly high price. In all, well intentioned but a failure."
2,clown suit,"This product was not what i expected..the hat was too small, but i already knew that by reading the comments before purchase..but i was also promised a clown wig instead of the hat in which i did not recieve..also the button fell off the morning of..not a happy customer on this order!"
2,Bad Hat,"The costume was terriffic and lived up to my expectations. Unfortunately, the hat, which was a key part of the costume, was poorly constructed in that it was way too small. It would not even fit on an infant's head. Unfortunately, I had expedited shipping because we needed the costume quickly. I had to use another hat at the last minute."
3,Cute and do the job.,"These are cute but do not look like the product pictured above. Although they are yellow balls and have a spongebob face, the face is super tiny on my set with the face only 1/3 the size of the above product picture. Not quite sure why but hey they are still easy to find and are still cute.I will try to remember and take a picture to add to the product when I get home."
5,Great for Kids!,"These are great golf balls. My 5 year son loves them. He was interested in golf but these make it really fun for him. He may like them a little too much, he wants to use them at the driving range and he lost one in a water hazard which caused a brief meltdown. These help keep his eye on the ball, when he tee's them up he likes to hit Sponge Bob in the face."
5,Great,Item was shipped fast and arrived in good shape. Was just as advertised. Cute present for a 10 year old boy
5,lightens the mood,"I bought these (and some pink Volvik Crystals) from the PGA Superstore when I received a gift card at a recent outing. I am an occasional golfer and couldn't justify buying Callaway Warbirds or anything like that. These make the game a little more fun, who can't help but chuckle looking at Spongebob's goofy face on a bright yellow ball. They conform with USGA rules and are especially nice when playing in the fall in Michigan because of the leaves on the ground. I am 30 and not ashamed to play Wilson's Spongebob golf balls."
4,Sponge Bob Golf Balls Cute!,These are fun and cute -- my son loves hitting them all over the house! Their bright yellow color makes them easy to locate!
4,Sponge Bob Golf Balls,"Fun, goofy purchase - but the balls hit as well as other similar priced golf balls. And the yellow color does make them easier to find in the woods (hopefully, that becomes less of a need if I can get better at the game)."
4,Cute gift for a spongebob lover,"No one has used these, and may never, but for a child who has everything Spongebob they made a big hit. No one was allowed to take them out of the package since he saves everything from his favorite character in like new condition. Who knows how far they would go if struck with a golf club, and who cares :-)."
4,Funny Gag Gift,"Saw these balls awhile ago and planned on getting them as joke for my friend. Ended up getting them from Christmas. They are pretty funny, and just as vibrant as any other yellows, if not more. These won't be seeing the course, as I don't want to lose any of them! Will use them for my indoor putting green!"
4,Stocking Stuffer,Great little stocking stuffer for lots of laughs. Can't miss a bright yellow goofy spongebob golfball on the golf course :)
3,Package was open.,"The package was open and all the golf balls were rolling around inside the box that they were shipped in. Since this is a Christmas gift, I had to glue the box together."
1,"Magnetic Poetry....""Unactractive""!","I've had my 2000 Magnetic Poetry calendar for a few days now but I expect to trash before January!First, let me say the the 150 word tiles are very limiting - so limiting in fact that the authors every example for each month uses words not found on the included tiles! If this is supposed to be a challange then why has the author strayed from his on rules? This book does not promote the art of poetry, which should be unrestrictive and free, but promotes a bit of frustration. Frustration not from just the limited selection of words but from the lame artwork, exagerated examples, and poor design (calendar is very heavy). Also keep in mind that these are magnetic so be careful you're using this close to a computer as it can really wreck your diskettes too!Stay away from this one."
2,Looks cool...but that's where the coolness ends,"This watch looks the part of a cool high tech gadget but when I recieved it, I was sorely disappointed. I don't have big wrists but when I put it on, it was barely big enough for me. The other problem is the LED lights don't stay lit all the time. Adding to that problem is a button must be pushed on the watch to get them to light up to tell you the time. One push makes the lights dance around for a few seconds and then the time appears. Pushing it twice in rapid succession makes the time appear without the wasting dance of lights. Who wants to be obligated to hit a button twice just to see the time? Great concept, cool look, NO function. I returned it the same day."
5,Groovy Jungle is Fantastic!!,"I thought Groovy shapes was pretty amazing, but this jungle version is just fantastic! (See my review of Groovy Shapes.) I am such a Groovy Music fan, especially after this new release. Forget the nephews, I'm getting myself a copy of this. The moving animals, the sound effects ~ it's so much fun to be creative with this software. And the content side of the program has increased slightly in difficulty... just enough for the new age bracket. This is too much fun!! Kudos to Sibelius for another wonderful product!"
4,Spork is not just your ordinary tool.,"Gosh,I can (almost) unreservedly recommend Spork. Some of the best lines in existence can be found here. Gems like ""when are we gonna make out?"" fit right into the funky mix. Some of the tracks on this album were found on privately released material, but who's griping? Spork never gets tiring. If there's one complaint, my girlfriend likes Spork more than she likes me. Oh, well. At least it's not N'Sync. Looking forward to Sporkday 2003."
1,Angela's Ashes this is NOT!,"I LOVED Angela's Ashes. Mr. Myers writes on the jacket of this book that this is supposedly ""America's answer to Angela's Ashes."" This is an insult to Frank McCourt. Mr. Myers's book is garbage. It's written at about a 4th grade level and the short stories are so formulaic that it actually gets annoying after the first 20 times. And his shameless attempts to coat-tail on the success of a real heart-felt book just adds insult to injury."
2,Row House Days - Why Read It?,"I received this book as a gift from my Mother who was born and raised in Southwest Philadelphia as I was and was excited to get started reading about the old neighborhood. Almost immediately, I could not figure out why geograhphic, street, and school names were changed. I found this very annoying although I could figure most of the real names out. I thought the story was a bit over indulgent by the author. He could have spent more time developing the other characters and providing a broader description of the neighborhood. The story did bring back lots of good memories - pimple ball, italian water ice, soft pretzels, lots of fights but it got monotonous after awhile. I read the first half of the book and just skimmed the rest since it lost my interest. I hope someone else will tackle a story about this neighborhood and add more historical perspective rather than a bunch of kid stories."
2,Row House Days,"I was very excited to read this book because I too grew up in southwest philly; I'm also the same age as the writer and figured I would reconize people, places and things mentioned in the book. What I found was street names changed, to protect what, I didn't understand. The author also states he attended Most Blesssed Scarment Catholic School, has a picture of the school included in the book and then doesn't even get to that part of his childhood in this book. That was a hugh misrepresentation to me. I attended M.B.S. and that was the main reason for purchasing the book. Some of his stories I identified with because we were both brought up in the city; but I was disappointed in the book overall. It didn't seem to me the book was about the subject I understood it to be."
5,Love it,Seen on Tv and love the series. Rewatching the all seasons with a friends from beggining to end. Love it!
1,"""Shirts & Skin"": clothed in disappointment","Tim Miller, one-time artistic nemesis of Jesse Helms and other conservative senators out to purge the National Endowment for the Arts of ""objectionable"" grant recipients, misses a real opportunity in ""Shirts & Skin."" A collection of essays and remembrances in rough chronological order, the book is intended to act as an artistic and personal memoir. What it winds up being is a journey towards Miller's realization that having two boyfriends is fun. He almost never discusses his work, and then only in extremely vague and short detail. But the minutiae of his open relationship(s), unfortunately, takes up great areas of space. At the end of the book, one wonders why Helms and Co. objected to Miller: he seems boring, rather than subversize. Truly a missed opportunity for author and reader."
2,"please, no more narcisism!","Too bad Mr. Miller does not recognize the difference between performance art and biography. If he had, we might have been offered some insights into the meaning of his work as a performance artist, or the importance of art done by and for gay people. Instead, we are treated to breezy passages about Mr. Miller's sex life. If he could get beyond the 'gee whiz, this feels great' stage, there might be some erotic charge, but alas, no such luck."
4,string,"this is a good product, the bad thing is that they charged 5 dollars for shipping when it came in the mail."
5,Best book for teaching writing to kids ever!,"Marcia's book is the best! It is completely practical and has step-by-step information about how to teach every genre of writing in totally KID-FRIENDLY terms! If your students aren't getting better by just going through the writing process, then this is the book for you! Her approach is unlike anything else on the market. It can make teaching writing, if not a breeze, then at least something over which you can gain control. I can't say enough about how useful this book is. If you can only buy one book to help you teach writing, then this is it!"
2,Not a How to book but a Why not to book,"I have been thinking about starting a computer business for some time now but after reading the first 30 pages I don't know why anyone would want to start a computer business. According to this book(on pg.29) if you made $200K in sales you would only make a little less than $17K in profit to divide between you and the tax man. Another is on establishing credentials(pg. 26), it says not to waste your time on a piece of paper that noone(the customer) will read, refering to certifications such as A+ or Microsoft. That may be true on a small business scale but if your small business fails good luck with your resume. There are alot of interesting points but very general. Anyone starting a computer business or any business for that should have already done their homework and be familiar with everything mentioned in this book. Overall, this is a great book to give to a kid if you want them to stay in school."
4,"Informative, but dated!","Great seller and an informative book over all. For those who are just starting out it helps to read this book, but I wish it was updated since it will soon be 10 years old!"
5,Best book for anybody who's starting a computer business!!,"I highly recommend this book to anybody who is starting a computer business.This book has detailed information about everything from Buying and selling PCs to Accounting. Nothing is left out. One of my favorite chapters is Selling your first PC which starts like this:You've sold your first PC to your mother's friend Doris, and then find out that whether you order it assembled or in pieces, there's not going to be any profit because you included Windows XP in the price but forgot to add in the cost.He covers aspects of the business that you could easily forget and cost you money later. Buy this book and avoid making costly mistakes in the future.This Book is written in a way that you can't lay it down, informative and realistic.Don't judge this book by its ugly cover. This book is definitely worth 3 times the price.Morris Book is one of the best books I've ever read, maybe because I am starting my own computer business."
3,Well worth the price,"""I didn't find it as good as the reviews would have you believe. It was a good book and it does have some sage advice and interesting parts; some funny parts and some really dull but necessary parts. (I think only an accountant could get excited over the tax chapter.) Mostly I garnered some good advice about what not to do in running a business especially refraining from buying too much wizz bang equipment etc. It was worth the money I paid for it and the time I spent reading it. """
5,An Excellent Resource!,"In this book, Mr.Rosenthal, like a trusted friend, gives the individual who is thinking about starting their own computer business much food for thought.The very first story, of how the budding computer consultant can loose money with the best of intentions,is an eye opener, and awakens the reader to the often harsh realties associated with the business of providing tech help or selling computers.If one pays attention, the benefit of Mr.Rosenthal's experience will guide the reader to make critical decisions,define the parameters of a successful business,(versus a hobby) and invaluable ways to avoid common pitfalls.You may be surprised to learn that well guarded industry ""secrets"" are laid bare (certifications,OME vendors) and that the most important aspect of surviving the trade is honesty and reliability.Highly reccomended."
2,Should be half as long or even less,"This book has 160 pages; 6 are blank, 8 have stupid cartoons on them, 19 are about building custom PCs (which virtually no-one does any more), 41 are about subjects on which Mr Rosenthal is no expert and about 6-10 are full of advice that is so trivial that you don't need to be told it. So less than half of the book has potentially useful information.There is useful information in there, but all in all there is only enough material for a series of magazine articles - not an entire book."
5,"Its not the size of the book, but what you get out of the book.","First of, this is my wife's amazon account (Amazon.com only let people that order from the site to write reviews. She bought it for me) and that's how good this book is! I was compelled to write a review and help others make a good choice. I wanted to get this book, because I wanted to try to open my own storefront for PC parts. However I haven't a clue where to start. A friend of mine suggested this book and boy does this book open your eyes! The book is about 160 pages, but every single page is worth at least a hundred bucks. I really like the author's writing style. To the point and precise. Also if you can, use the links that he he has posted in the book (ESPECIALLY SCORE). To summarize, if you are thinking of owning a PC business (regardless if its a home business to a store front to consulting) GET THIS BOOK!"
3,Okay for a non-seasoned professional,"The book was fine for a one-person start-up. It gave insightful information, but mostly full of generalizations. It didn't assist much for what I wanted."
1,Don't waste your time with this one!,"I sure wish I could get back those 2 hours of my life! Fortunately, that's all I spent on this ""book"". I don't think I took away a single useful fact or insight. The author deals in the patently obvious, and I was really hoping for a lot more. And what is it with the VERY amateurish illustrations? Save your time and money folks and move along, there is nothing here..."
2,Not a Big Fan,"Howard Frank Mosher's novel ""A Stranger in the Kingdom"" is quite a slow read. Set amidst the colorful countryside of Vermont, Mosher spins a tale of a small town that is suddenly turned upside down when an amicable and intelligent black minister is accused of murder in the first degree. The year is 1952, so of course out of this incident comes issues of prejudice and racial indifference from members of the community. Although it may seem as if this book is jammed packed with plot twists and unrelenting suspense, Mosher doesn't even introduce readers to the story's central plot until about chapter 14 (about halfway through the book!)Even then, I had a hard time keeping my interest. I guess if you have some time to spare and you want to see if this book is your cup of tea, by all means go ahead. In my opinion though, I wouldn't waste your time."
2,Stranger in the Kingdom,"Howard Frank Mosher did a great job of setting his book in New England. The characters were well rounded, the reader was given a lot of details on the area and the town was a small New England town. However with such great work on the back ground the book needed a little more umph. The book didnt actually start till about chapter 14. There was a lot of detail that the reader could have done without. Once it became a murder mystery in a small town it became quite good. It had a lot of twist and turns. People were betrayed and others learned the meaning of life. If you have a long weekend stuck in doors this is a great book. If you plan on a fast read think again."
3,Mockingbird in New England,"A very To Kill a Mockingbird-esque story about a small town in 1950s Vermont that is suddenly shaken by murder. The suspect is the town's new black preacher, Rev. Andrews. While traditionally pre-Civil War New England was a haven for escaped slaves, abolitionists, and of course advocates of freedom and equal rights (going all the way back to colonial America, which was New England), modern small New England towns, even today, tend to have a very minimal black population. Kingdom is no exception. So while most New Englanders pride themselves on their racial-tolerance and acceptance, it is very rarely tested.Though be fore-warned it can be a slow-read."
5,Howard Frank Mosher is an excellent writer,"Mosher has created a wonderful community in the North East of Vermont and populated itwith wonderfully believable characters. His stories unfold with a crispness that is a refreshingchange in today's fiction market.I would recommend this book, as well as other title's by the same author for anyone who wouldlike to escape into a place where the characters react honestly to the challenges set before them."
3,A review,"I enjoyed reading this book. The beginning started off a little slow, but it was still enjoyable. I just wish we knew what was really going on sooner."
3,court T.V.,"Howard Mosher's novel, A Stranger in the Kingdom I felt began sluggish. The opening chapters took the time to connect the reader to the Kinneson family. By allowing the reader to see into their days full of innocent bickering between each other, I felt more like this was my own family. If you're the type of reader that likes mystery t.v. this novel will suit your needs perfectly. Not giving any secrets, I thought the novel was a long read but somewhat tolerable."
5,Kept me guessing until the end,"Filled with amazing plot twists that are sure to keep you guessing until the end, I recommend this book to anyone. The theme of predjudice was universal; one every reader could understand or relate to. I enjoy reading murder mystery type stories, and this one was no different. I enjoyed the trial, and the surprise at the end of it. The plot twists made the story more intriguing and more suspenseful. If you enjoy page turners, this book is one you'd want to pick up."
4,An album for everybody to hear!,"First of all, this is a really great effort by Pink Floyd. I *do* think that they could have combined this album into a single disc, but it still works out great. There are some really great songs here though (Comfortably Numb, Mother, Another Brick in the Wall, Hey You). Whenever I am in a bad mood or stressed out, I pop in this cd and it completely relaxes me. A must have for any Pink Floyd fan and anybody who has good taste in rock and roll."
4,"Awesome book, not the greatest package","The book was used so I wasn't expecting mint conditions or anything, but the packaging it came in was one of those thick envelopes that sort of feels like it's made from card board, but isn't. Needless to say, the packaging was quite beat up and torn by the time it got to me, so I was worried about the condition of the book.It was exactly what I needed for my class, though!"
2,Artful Dodger,"This book is a printer's reject. All the page groups are bound out or order. What do you expect for $3 and change? To be told what it is would be nice - not in ""Good Condition"", although the book is clean and has not been ""dog eared"". I probably would have bought it anyway being hardup for dough."
1,The Art of Responsive Drawing 5th Edition,"While most books I have purchased through Amazon have met my expectations, I was disappointed to receive a copy of The Art of Responsive Drawing 5th Edition that was not correctly bound. The pages were out of sequence making the copy impossible to read. There may be more like this one. so buyers should be aware & inspect copies carefully. I have never encountered this problem before in either a new or used book."
5,Works well,Was always wondering if these things really did work so took the chance to see and they do the job. Watching the video made it very easy to get started on the sharpening so make sure to watch it first.
2,SOOOO HARD TO MASTER THIS TOOL - UNWISE PURCHASE,"I am very good at learning mechanical things. They just seem to come to me easily. Until the Drill Doctor that is. I purchased a new top of the line model and a spare diamond wheel. After reading the manual twice and watching the dvd I only have success about 20% of the time. It is a VERY frustrating tool to use. There does not seem to be a ""magic formula"" for success in using it. I then assumed it was defective and the factory graciously replaced the tool for me with a brand new one. I have tried the replacement and still the same difficulties. If someone REALLY wants one of these I'd strongly suggest trying it out at a store that will let you do so. In their favor the company is VERY polite and DOES try to be helpful. I give up. It is a yard sale item for next summer."
5,Drill Doctor,Drill Doctor 500X 3/32-Inch to 1/2-Inch Drill Bit Sharpener. Have not used it yet. Left on garage steps by delivery.
5,Nice job of sharpening twist drill bits!,I was skeptical of this product. I thought the promise of a quick sharpening were too much to believe. I was wrong. This tool does a great job and after the first two set-ups I can sharpen a bit now in under a minute. Very nice.I wish there was a similar machine I could use to sharpen my wood bits!
5,doug21951,"I bought a Drill Doctor 10 years ago and it has kept my bits sharp. The newer model makes it a breeze to split points when I wish to. This wasn't quite as easy with the older model. It is also much easier to deal with masonary bits. As with the first 'Doctor' I owned, it is important to watch the video and read the directions before venturing off into sharpening. I would bet most folks who have negative comments, save parts issues, wouldn't if they watched and read first. Like anything else, practice makes perfect. I recommend this tool to anyone wanting to keep bits sharp and save a bit of cash along the way."
5,Read and practice,"The Drill doctor is one of those tools that would seem easy to use ,out of the box.Not so. If you don't read the sometimes confusing manual ,you will want to send it back immediately because of frustrating results.First,after reading the manual about 3 times,find a bunch of old drills and PRACTICE,just on sharpening. When you get good at that, move on to split pointing,which also needs to be practiced to achieve satisfactory results.I would recommend Drill Doctor to revisit their manual and make it easier to read.It's a bit pricey for the materials of construction"
2,drill doctor 500x could be over rated,I got the drill doctor 500x to replace the original drill doctor. I don't think this one is any better. It just a hit and miss situation when trying to sharpen a drill bit. Buy at your own risk. beware.
4,Does the Job,I first picked out the lowest price model but after reading the instructions I decided that the 500X was going to be much more productive for the over 100 bits that I would be sharpening.The device is everything that they say it is and if you are going to do much hand drilling the ability to split the point is great.I am well satisfied.
4,Good Product,I ordered this product because I got tired of being stopped in the middle of a project by a broken or dull bit. Rummaged through my toolboxes and pulled out 25 years of old bits. Sharpened a whole tub of bits in a little over an hour. This thing did everything they said it does.A worthwhile addition to my shop.
4,A Wild Ride,"This is my first Ridley Pearson although I have read many other thrillers. I will definitely be reading more of his. Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews are an awesome team together conducting an investigation within an investigation into a series of (as a parent I can only say) heart-wrenching baby snatchings in the Seattle area. Definitely keeps you turning those pages, especially late at night. Good read. Well worth the effort."
2,Audio Version Spoils the Book,"I'm rating the audio edition of this title. The reader's halting, stumbling, faltering delivery of this text completely detracts from the story, plot and action. I suffered through the second side of tape one, boxed up the tape and took the ""book"" to the used book store and traded it for the paperback! The story is ventage Pearson -- you either like his writing or not. I do."
4,a real fun read!!,"Just an all around fun time caught up in a book. The mystery is great, the characters are likable, and it's all done with minimum violence.My first by this author - and it won't be my last!"
4,Pearson is Piercing,"As it says on the book backing....""Who's that knocking at your door?...Do you always look?...Do you always know?"", I kept asking myself those piercing questions throughout this horrific yet fascinating read.In ""The Pied Piper"", Pearson gives us a twisting plot that hits home hard, especially if you have children. Seattle detective Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews, a forensic specialist team up to hunt down the penne flute leaving abducter.Well woven plot that grips you in terror and does not let go, not even after the last page is read.Thanks--CDS"
5,Excitement +++,"Another suspenseful read from Ridley Pearson, with the wonderful characters from his previous books. This is another book that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for the next scary moment. Ridley is a master at weaving tales with great characters in a plot that will keep you guessing and hiding your eyes. If you are a fan or new this author you've got a lot of great books ahead of you! Enjoyed it immensely!"
5,The Pied Piper,"I have had excellent results ordering from re-sellers. ""The Pied Piper"" was no exception. The book was in such good condition I donated it to our public library.I always order books listed in ""very good condition"" and have never been disappointed. Thanks, Amazon.Phyllis Thomson"
3,Very long! 499 pages should have been 399,"The Book kept my interest in the beginning but it began to drag in the middle. At times, I thought it rambled. Interesting subject but weak ending"
2,Utter Confusion,"Ridley Pearson goes out of his way to make you back track every 5 pages, just to see if you are still reading the same book that you started out with. How anyone can say that this author is ""Pure Genious"" is beyond me. This book is confusing and nonstimulating and I don't know why I read past page 5."
1,BORING!!!!,"I guess if I hadn't read so many novels from other authors I wouldn't know any better. Although I agree that the main character ""Lou Boldt"" should be different than the prototypical 'cop on the edge' I think Pearson took it too far. Boldt doesn't swear and drives a Volvo? I thought of my nerdy neighbor!! I just couldn't relate nor feel for the title character. Besides the fact that Boldt was/is a nerd the story itself is average at best. I felt that this kind of story has been done several times over. Do yourself a favour and read Baldacci, Follett, and DeMille."
3,A good pass-the-time novel.,"There's not a whole lot of substance in this novel, yet it moves along, the plot is interesting, and the characters know-able. I had some difficulty stringing the characters together, and my mind wandered a bit during less than interesting pages but it was enjoyable nonetheless. Mr. Pearson has an unusual way of forming sentences at times, and this tended to throw me off balance as I had to read some sentences over again. All in all, a good way to pass the time, but no bestseller here."
4,Nail Biting Ending,"Lou Bolt is one of my favorite characters and he shines in this one. There was a lot of detail in police procedural which is probably appreciated by aficionados, but for the average reader it tends to slow the story down now and then. Other than that, it's a very good tale with a high tension ending. I loved it."
3,OBSOLETE BOOK,"This is NOT the Munther Younes Arabic textbook to buy.It is outdated, and does not include an audio component. Tapes may be ordered separately, and are not cheap.ANYONE INTERESTED IN THIS SERIES MUST INSTEAD BUY:""Living Arabic: A comprehensive introductory course"", also by Prof. Younes and illustrated by Micah Garen. Also available on Amazon. That purchase will include the audio component in CD and DVD.Living Arabic: A Comprehensive Introductory Course [With CD (Audio) and DVD] (Arabic Edition)"
2,Elementary Arabic: An Integrated Approach,I received the book in a very good condition. This book does not include an audio tapes with it. I can not get good use of this book without audio tapes. I wish that I was told that the audio of this book is not included. Thank you
5,good sealant,"I use this product for sealing hardware to the deck of my boat. It isn't messy, stays somewhat flexible, and seems to last forever, or at least a long time. One roll goes a long way and it's cheap."
3,Meh,"This tape is not the highly sticky product that I was looking for. I doubt it will keep water out of my boat, which is the reason I bought it. Wound up getting a product that cost twice as much but that works in the way I wanted it to. You get what you pay for."
4,Too Many Alternate Takes,"This is Chris in top form; however, how many alternate takes are needed. Virtually every tune has an alternate take and the cd would have been better served if it included additional tunes. This is my primary ""beef"""
4,Content Is King,"The development of free, valuable content is a great strategy for creating a website or blog. ""Cashing In With Content"" provides a thorough overview of how to accomplish this. Twenty examples of various organizations who have successfully used this strategy to improve their businesses are provided with a corresponding collection of best practices and lessons learned. I highly recommend this book to those wishing to develop a high traffic website or seeking to transition their business from offline to online."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!!,"This book is everything it promised and more. You can take everything that is covered and apply it to your website to make it some place buyers wish to go when they are ready to buy. It is well writen, easy to read and very informative. The only way this book won't work for you is if you read it and don't apply the ideas you've learned from it to your website."
1,This is NOT an amplified phone,"Over the last 6 years or so I bought 3 Ameriphone C-40 for different elderly members of my family, this time I made the mistake of buying this phone, BAD MISTAKE , it is not even close to the amplification of the Ameriphone. This phone is NOT for the hearing impaired, I thought that it was going to be the same amplification as the ameriphone but with bright lights to signal an incoming call, the lights are there but the amplification is a joke."
2,I don't think the authors are a**holes!,"Obviously, this book gets most of it's humor from exaggerating a**hole and misogynistic tendencies. It tries too hard to get a reaction out of the reader, and tries to make things that aren't funny...funny.I'm probably more of a jerk than most guys in the world, and this book sounds like it was written by a bunch of ""nice guys"" who wanted to sound like jerks. The content in this book sounds like their theorized notions of a jerk paragon.For example, I'll talk about their section on meeting girls in bars. I'm 25, so I'm talking about the 21-27 section. It became clear to me that these guys either never did or are really bad at meeting girls in bars at my age. The tricks they talk about are so basic and often miss the point.To it's credit, the book does touch on subtle social truths. But the reader has to filter them out from the book's attempted humor. If you're a natural jerk, you probably won't find this to be all that funny."
3,Scary but funny,"Okay, I'm a female and I laughed out loud. Some of it is really scary, but girls you owe it to yourselves to at least read it in the spirit with which it was intended - to help these poor schmoes we call ""men"", since they are so clueless that it takes a book like this (basically, a literary equivalent of a caveman's club over the head) to get them to learn any sort of social skill, however misguided. But parts *are* funny and it is a rare insight into the insane male mind. You must read this if you read ""The Rules"" or any other stupid book. Run for the hills if you ever run across a first class A**hole like the ones touted in this book!"
1,"As satire, I approve. As anything else it is disgusting.","This is hilarious satire. Fat chicks as ""evil monsters,"" watching football for six hours straight, tricking women, manipulating them. This is like ""The Rules"" for men, only it's actually supposed to be funny.Dear God, I hope so anyway.Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many, many sex-starved idiots who take this book seriously. May they find the shallow, empty, needy woman of their dreams and have many ugly, whiny children."
1,Waste of money,"As my title states, this book was a waste of money. It's not bad reading while you're sitting in the bathroom, but don't buy this book thinking you will learn anything or gain insight. It is strictly toilet humor/reading."
3,Dissapointing.,"This book was written by Mr. and Mrs. Obvious. And neither is really that big of an ""a**hole."" Actual title should've been ""The complete Pompous Douche Guide to the Obvious."" Not at all useful as a guide and really not that good of a parody/comedy. Probably a good read if you need confirmation of what you can already percieve. Or just go with your instinct."
1,Not very practical,This is humorous reading at best. Not very practical advice I've found. Not worth investing in if you want to learn how to interact like a real man with women.
5,The best thing since sliced bread!,"Dude, this book works. I followed it's techniques and was able to seal the deal on a hot blonde one weekend, a gorgeous brunette the following weekend, and keep them both going for about two months before I got tired of dealing with them and moved onto a different blonde. For years, I have had no luck with women unless they were handed to me on a silver platter. Now I am the man. I've passed it off to my friends and their game has started to pick up as well. Trust me, if some of them can get laid using this book, ANYONE can!"
1,Not What You'd Expect,"Here's the thing. Im' a 28-year-old female who appreciates dirty filthy humor. I was even a huge laughing-so-hard-I'm-crying fan of the Tucker Max autobio. This book is nothing like that. It's just poorly written and all over the place in terms of topics. So much so that I can't even finish the prologue let alone the first chapter!If you like the raunchy, unbelievable stories, stick to Tucker, Chelsea Handler, and the people who are tried and true in this department."
2,"Funny, but useless.","For those of you that actually NEED a guide to ""handle chicks,"" save your money. This book won't help you. Just be yourself, and chicks will come to you. Unless you suck, then pretend to be someone else, and get a lot of money.This book, is, however, slightly humorous, and is worth a cheap laugh."
2,Spend your money on better material.,"If you want some quick humor then this book hardly gets the job done. If you are looking for a ""guide"" on how to handle and get with women, then please look else where."
1,Worst book ever,"This book is as useless as it is boring. As someone who is successful in meeting women and understanding the dynamic of the ""badboy"" or ""a**hole"", I can certify that these guys just don't get it. It's like it was written by guys who had no idea what they were talking about, but had perhaps researched the idea online. So if it's not informative, then it should at least be funny right? Wrong. A 12 year old might find this stuff funny. it's one of a few books ever that I simply had no interest in reading cover to cover. it's not worthy of my bookshelf, I wouldn't do a friend the disservice of pawning it off on them - so for the first time ever, i think I am going to throw a book in the garbage."
2,Funny? Yes...Useful? No,"Being a guy I did find this book to be hilarious, however I thought it would give some useful advice for us nice guys and it did not. So if you want a laugh, then by all means get this book...but if you are actually wanting to improve with women then pass this up."
4,Entertaining,"This book is for pure entertainment value only. If you're looking for a real a**hole's guide to handling chicks I would check out some other books, like 'the Game'. That being said, this book has it's moments. Parts will make you laugh out loud while others kind of drag on. It's worth checking out if you like college style humor and it should definitely be on the bookshelf of every frat house."
4,Counter-intuitive advice,"Some of the advice is standard: don't be needy, show value, exploit insecurity. But these guys go a step further: what do you do when you are in your 30s and 40s and 50s? The answer: get married before you turn 40 because women will not trust a man over 40 who has never been married. Of course, they go on to talk about cheating on your wife(always deny, never leave a trail), finding a wife with money(reminds you of the Sam Kinison routine: homelessness is solved by either getting a job or sleeping with someone who has a job), make sure you have a wad of cash for the divorce and take steps to protect your assets. And speaking of Kinison---these guys write like they are channeling him. It is often harsh, sometimes inappropriate, and usually a distortion of the truth, but isn't all humor?"
4,Funny approach,"Very humorous method presented. Some interesting ideas, some which are right on and direct. In the world of today this would work in many cases, especially when you're young. I think women a bit older may have been used like this previously and would not be as receptive.Great for a few laughs though."
2,Funny But....,"As somebody who essentially can 'pick up chicks' I found this book to be a moderately funny read for when you come back from the bar feeling drunk, but it is nowhere near being a serious guide for actually attracting/picking up/seducing women. If you really are looking to improve with women try books by Ross Jeffries, Neil Strauss or Steve Horsfall"
4,For belly laughs only,"This book is laugh-out-loud funny, but please note that it's intended as a humor book, and not a realistic book on dating advice.Having said that, someone new to the self-help-dating-scene will glean a few pieces of good info here, but basically it's for pure entertainment value (as is ""The Game"").Conclusion: Get this book, get ""The Game"", and have fun.For real dating tips, get Gary Brodsky's ""How To Be A Prick"" CDs, and How To Become An Alpha Male (get it used, it's WAY overpriced). Avoid gimmicky, manipulative junk like Style/Mystery Method or Ross Jeffries...this stuff MIGHT get a drunk/stupid/slutty female into your bed, but you'll rarely get a quality girlfriend from it (even the authors admittedly can't keep a GF)."
1,This is stand-up comedy. For teenagers. Virgin teenagers.,"Short version: ReadThe Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artistsinstead. Even reading an internet chat room would be better than this drivel.This is not a book about 'how to' do anything. This is sophomoric stand-up comedy that fails to amuse, inform, or even seem to be attempting either. There is no useful advice in this book, but if you squint real hard, you can see the partially-remembered remains of recycled Andrew Dice Clay drivel mixed into the filler.This book, however, isn't even good enough to be offensive. A Maxim reader would be insulted by this book."
1,eh,"kinda funny, but its a tough read. there are alot of charts that extend to the next page, so you have to flip back and forth."
2,unexpected,I wanted a metal detector for my husband and son. I thought this was a different product. It is still in the box not being used.
3,Wacky but useful,"I categorize certain cookbooks as ""wacky"". The presenceof recipes with names like ""pear ginger cake"" or ""roastedratatouille pizza"", for example, will put a cookbook in the wacky category. This should not be confused with bad. Main does use yogurt and aged cheese in many of the recipes, so this is far from the best cookbook for those with true milk allergies. But both the allergic and the lactose intolerant will find the introductory material enjoyable and enlightening; Brenda Davis' explanation of calcium absorption is one of the most up-to-date I've seen in a cookbook. Nutritional information for each recipe is supplied. The presentation is attractive, and while this isn't exactly a complete basic cookbook, the directions are fairly detailed and do not assume much expertise. The layout of the recipes, notes and directions is exceptionally attractive"
5,French Families of the Detroit River Region,"Wonderful reference books with very accurate information, has been loads of help with my research."
2,French Families of the Detroit River Region,The family information and dates are accurate but I found the anglicization of the given names most annoying. In earlier years a name such as James Chauvin is ludicrous and obviously in error but in later years a name such as Peter Daniau may or may not be the actual name of the person. There is no way to tell from this publication.
4,Manages Straight Help Files Just Fine..,"I've been working with the X5 version now for six months. What it does really well is manage a great many files for various outputs, htm, chm, flash. It's pdf output is rather pathetic, though. I end up printing to WORD and then editing from there. If you use Robohelp to print to PDF, you lose all links in the document.where it is extremely buggy is in version control. We're using RCS system, and so far my 1600 + help system has crashed twice.. with no apparent reason. This last time it just divorced itself from version control.Indexing and TOC features are easy to use, and for plain writers that need to present a lot of information with simple bells and whistles, Robohelp does provide a lot of versatility.The note of caution, though, is back up regularly."
1,What a god awful book.,"I don't know where to start. First of all, ""ever hear of spell check""? How can a book go to print with so many errors. Especially sad when it's a computer book. I found numerous inaccuracies and miscomprehention by the author in the area of basic topics. This isn't a novel. The reason you buy a textbook is to learn answers. Being told the wrong answer is both frustrating and time consuming.My synopsis: there are much better books on the market than this one. Don't waste your money!"
5,Love this toy,I purchased this toy for my 15 month old daughter for Christmas. She learned her animal sounds and how to put the pieces in place. Great learning toy!
2,I'm sooo disappointed!,I was really excited to finally get this video and it's completely fake. I feel like I got gyped. I realize this video has been out quite a while but I guess I've been living under a rock and didn't know it was fake. The Banned From TV Uncensored videos are much better!
2,Faces of death,"As i knew the UNCUT version of this from my Danish tape i was disusted to see that this ""30TH ANNIVERSARY edition"" was missing a scene that lasts about 4 minutes !!Would have thought that they released it uncut when going through the trobles of making a ""3oth Anniversay""...."
1,nothing like the real McCoy!,"I had the real 10,000 faces of death that was BANNED everywhere because of he gruesome death scenes that were real and actual scenes of people being eat by all types of animals!This is not at all anywhere near the tape from the 1980's that showed real accidents of attacks by bears,tigers,gators,and many more violent acts of death that did occur that made me sick,yes sick!Waiste of your money to see the fake death acts,better yet,buy a good movie of better quality to watch than this piece of make believe BS!!"
3,It was allright,"I didn't feel like I missed anything with this book, it just didn't appeal to me. I didn't find it scary and I never really cared about the characters. There was some cool imagery and I like the idea of the house being moved and the ghosts from the street coming with it. I also liked the way he told the story. I just never cared about anyone so in the end I felt nothing. It read fine, and as I always say, reading is a personal experience and just because it did not strike a chord with me does not mean it won't strike one with you. If anything I admire the style and quality of the writing. I will probably check out something else by this author in the future."
4,Eerie and Compelling,"I always get excited when I see a new T.M. Wright book out on the stands... and this one is no exception. There are a few spelling errors that sometimes pop up throughout the book, but that can't be blamed on the author... fire the copy editor!!!! This novel resonated with me long after I was finished. The mythology was facinating, the characters real, and the pacing of the scenes and dialogue moved wonderfully. I was slightly unsatisfied with the ending, but I still rank T.M. Wright among the top 10 horror authors of the last 2 decades."
2,Dont Bother-Borrow this one from the library,"My mother bought this book for me for xmas, i was so excited she gave it to me early. What a let down. Im a huge Laymon fan with his tragic passing i am trying to find new horror authors who I can sink my teeth into unfortunatly I dont think I will bother with T.M Wright again. I found this story to be flat and very unexciting. The main character Katherine was not a very likeable girl so I felt nothing for her or anyone else really (I did like Gloria.Im confused about what happened to her ghost)So what I suppose im trying to say is that this story is just plain flat with nothing to make you jump or be in the least bit frightened. Leave it on the shelf and reread a Richard Laymon instead I guarantee you will Love it!"
2,tame psychological ghost story,I think people who enjoy the writings of say Tanith Lee would possibly enjoy this book. It was well written and not hard to follow but nothing much ever happened in it. Maybe I didnt grasp the concept or get what the author was trying to convey. I have enjoyed T.M. Wrights other books but found this one to be a little boring.
2,Confusing ghost story,"Although a few scenes were very eerie, Wright's latest novel is chock full of plot holes and several questions go unanswered. This one is for ghost-story completists only."
2,Relax!,"Dear Mr. Wright...Hey...take it easy there! You are a great writer, and I have enjoyed many of your novels. And, yes, there are holes in this story! Get a grip! It's not the end of the world."
2,boring,"This is the first book I've read by T.M. Wright and I'd say probably the last as I found it incredibly boring really. I continued to think something was going to happen but nothing really ever did. If this is ""a horror few could imagine"" then I must be one of the few because I not only imagined it to be much better but I didn't imagine it to end as anti-climatic as it was. The good news is it only takes a few hours to read, the bad news is that's about how long it takes to forget about the predictable story.2/5 stars"
1,Bible code cd review,despite my interest this is a major disappointment difficult to get it working and Soon I lost interest in it
1,Don't buy,I work with computers day and night. I've yet to figure out how to install this thing. It's NOT INSTALLATION FRIENDLY AT ALL. There's no user guide or installation guide.
1,Not user friendly,I wish I had not purchased this item. Not user friendly--confusing to use for a novice.
5,I love Obagi,I am an Obagi fan! I wish you could get the Obagi Clear! You make it so much easier to find it since it comes online!
4,I agree with the author's self graded review: an 'A'.,"Romance, eggs, bacon, solitude, CB radios, and big, big woods."
5,Love this Mixer,"I have 2 of these, and have been using one over 2 years, it is sturdy, well made and travels well. I do an onsite fast set up every week, and travel back and forth with this in a computer case, it's great. I like what it does for my purposes, using wireless receivers directly into the mixer with XLR connections, clean, nice and has everything I could want and more. I love this piece of equipment!"
5,gift for mom,my 73 year old mom really enjoyed this book and so did I. It inspired a lot of memories for her and I enjoyed hearing all her memories.
5,christmas book,I love this book. It has things in it from when i was a kid. The pictures are great too.
4,A lovely walk down Memory Lane,Beautiful photos and information about Christmas past; a lovely nostalgic remembrance of childhood holiday memories!
2,Extremely basic book for the beginner,"I found this book to be a useful resource for general knowledge, but it lacked lots of important information that is needed to properly keep leopard geckos. The author's style of writing is refreshingly free of overly technical terms and ""scientific"" language, so this book would be appropriate for younger keepers or those who want only the most elementary information. The book make numerous glaring ommissions on proper care though, while adding extraneous information that does little to help. An example of this is the 3 page discussion on types of heaters that never even mentions at what temperature geckos should be kept. Overall, it's not a bad book but it was frustrating for me to try and find detailed technical information that simply was not included. Although it does well to introduce leopard geckos to the novice, this book is definitely not a stand alone resource for the serious keeper."
5,Best Practices for Organizational Leadership,"Just finished reading ""Executive Values"" and highly recommend it to anyone interested in well researched and applied ""best practices"" for leaders. Dr. Senske shares how he exercises biblically sound principals when making difficult business decisions. A true team builder and respector of others, his insights add value to studies on ethics, as well as business and management. A must read for funders, managers, teachers, clergy, and others concerned about pitfalls, such as led to collapse of Enron."
5,"Executive Values: The ""Possible"" Balance","Kurt Senske offers a practical wide-ranging approach to balancing the critical issues for executives - the bottom line v. relationships, and family v. career. His ascertain that Christian faith is the point that makes this balance possible offers hope for executives and their organizations, and their families. Executive Values is well researched. Senske has brought together supporting evidence from a wide range of sources in the political, corportate, and non-profit arenas."
3,Does the Job,"My employer asked me to read this book, and being a dutiful employee, I did. Most of the advice Senske proffers is sound common sense: Do right by your customers, your employees, and your family, and doing good will result in your doing well. The book grows out of modern management literature rather than the Bible, and Senske virtually ignores Old Testament stories that might have been applied to management training. Nevertheless, the Scripture he does use is handled sensibly and without guile. I dropped the book one star for not including an index."
4,Beautiful Set,"It's a beautiful set, but it's not as sturdy as my old cheap stoneware set. I purchased an 4 extra place settings, so if it chips I have the replacements."
1,burnt rubber,"When I used this on my hairdryer, it smelled like burnt rubber the whole time. It also didn't seem to do the work of a diffuser. The air just came out of one side of the cover. This product didn't add anything or work like a diffuser. Pointless purchase."
1,Parsons Chairs with Microfiber,"DO NOT ORDER THESE CHAIRS!!!!!! They look ok until you start putting them together! We couldn't even get one leg in because there is a nail or something in the hole where the screw goes!!!!! Also they are wrinkled, the fabric, wrinkles up on the back of the chair. I wish I could post a photo of this. (Will try and see if I can). But that is not the worst part. It is the problems with the seller, they will not send me a return label to ship these back. SO I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THESE AND WATCH WHAT YOU BUY FROM THIS SELLER. I have contacted AMAZON also, this may change my Christmas Shopping for this year if this is not resolved...."
5,I want to cry,"I can't believe Hunter x Hunter the anime has finally crossed over to the US waters. This is my top most favorite anime of all time, and the gateway anime that lead me to the anime addiction I now bare.As mentioned by one of the other reviewers, if you are looking for a story with great character development, enough action and a great story, the first anime I will always recommend is hunter x hunter."
1,Jason Placemats,Jason Chilli Verde Lunch Placemats - Set Of 6I bought two sets of Jason Placemats earlier this year. Considering how expensive they are one would think the quality would stand up to the price.The placemats started peeling off in the first week on use and within a month the cork board starting chipping. This happened with both prints.I immediately wrote to Jason placemats requesting a contact to understand the refund policy. It has been over 6 weeks and they have yet to respond.My advice to those who are considering Jason placemats - DONT BUY THEM. All they offer is pretty prints. The quality is not as good as pimpernel
4,I loved it.,"As a man who loves all things SF, this book captures with tactician skill the nuances of post WWII SF youth/outlaw culture. Quick, go go read as well. Reminds me of Fante if that works for you. Highly recommended."
5,"Great price, great condition!!","My daughter needed this book for her high school Spanish class. It proved much more frugal for me to order through Amazon- I got a great price from this seller, the book was in great condition even though it was listed as used & it was worth waiting for! Thank you!!"
1,Worst video I've ever seen.,The title is misleading. The video quality is just downright poor. It will show her head and shoulders only while she is doing stretches over her head. The video looks like is was shot in her apartment in a space she can barely move in with cable wires hanging out of the wall in the background. When she is doing stretches it doesn't always show all of her body which makes it completely unhelpful for the viewer. I cannot get past the poor quality of the video to even take her seriously. I cannot believe I wasted money on this. I cannot believe she would actually sell this and feel good about herself and her name. This video should be reported.
1,ARE YOU KIDDING?!!!!!,DON'T BUY!!!!! This has got to be the worst . I could not get over how dirty and linty her carpet was. forget the space I thought she was a joke. I could not even go through the whole exercise. Anyway another item for Goodwill.
3,Shatner eat your heart out!!,"So Bryan Ferry of Roxy music was hanging out one day in London during 70's watching Happy Days and thought, ""Ya, know? I wanna be look like Fonzi and cover The Beatles and Dylan too."" And the rest is, shall we say, You Tube search history! (Actually, The above album and thus photo PRE DATES Arthur Fonzerelli, Johnny Nogerelli et al by about a year but still...he looks like the FONZ!!)I'm in giddy shock over this album. There were 1970's TV stars like Shatner, Jack Webb, Nimoy, Savalas etc who made albums of cover songs so they could sound LIKE a Bryan Ferry type singer, yet Bryan Ferry made a cover album that sounds LIKE a 70's TV star covering songs and sounding like BRYAN FERRY! It's Golden Throats meet post -modernism.He was new to singing here so this is less polished and more like Eastern European karaoke night at a Russian cafe near Angel Tube station. Fun stuff though!! CAMPY!!"
2,Please Look Elsewhere For An Ab Workout,"Well, for some background information...I am pretty fit but needed a little extra toning in my abdominal area. I decided to try this video after watching the infomercial. I found out that to get the best results from this you have to perform almost impossible moves to even do the exercise. If you have bad knees or ankles forget it. I went back to my crunches and situps and worked extra hard doing planks as well and found my abs firming right up. Save your money."
3,Another Ab Workout,"The product dvds and packaging was in great condition. The only negative thing I would say is that technically yes the exercises are crunchless but ladies, do not think you won't be doing hard stomach conditioning. I bought this because sit ups and crunches hurt my neck but the most of the exercises still hurt my neck so I discontinued using."
1,Nervous prospect,"Wow, I was considering getting this video and although the few positives seem genuine, the negative reports are adamant and appear truly valid. I think I will hold out for a higher quality product."
4,Feels great!,"I have only been able to do the workouts a few times; but, I can tell that they will work. You feel all the moves. The instructions are detailed. As long as you maintain form, you feel it!"
1,"Not for overweight, out of shape","The advertising or packaging does not tell you that you have to be in fit to do the exercises. I am 30 pounds overweight and in decent shape, but could not perform the exercises. Several of them are impossible! Don't buy it unless you are already fit."
3,Exercise those abs,This DVD kept me busy. It took a few times to stay with it...but that was just because I was really out of shape. My abs may never look like those on the packaging but I feel more toned and trim without having to go to a gym. Big help!
3,Harder than it looks,"""Ab"" exercises are never fun and some of these are harder than they look. But I like having them in 10 minute segments. Let's just hope they work!"
5,Flamin' Groovies - 'In Person!!' (Norton),"Cannot believe no one else has ever reviewed this killer archive live release. First ten tracks are from a show that was one of the last ever gigs to take place at the Fillmore West on June 30, 1971. Plus 'In Person!' also feature the Ron Loney line-up of the Groovies. What more can you ask for? Oh, and this live recording was originally taped for an FM radio broadcast, thus you know the quality HAS to be at least very good. Dug every foot stomping proto-punk song this disc had to offer, like the opener, a cover of The Who's ""I Can't Explain"", ""Road House"", ""Shakin' All Over"", ""Doctor Boogie"", the absolute Groovies gem ""Teenage Head"", the garage rock staple ""Louie Louie"" and Bo Diddley's ""I'm A Man"". Personnel: Ron Loney-vocals, James Ferrell & Cyril Jordan-guitars, George Alexander-bass and Danny Milm-drums. Simply a must-have."
5,American Civil War,the item was in the exact condition it was advertised as. the seller was prompt in shipping the item and it arrived on time. great customer service and i would greatly consider buying from this seller again. 100% satisfaction
1,Poor Quality,"It worked for a while. Then I took it into salt water and that was all she wrote. I can't get the key in. I have tried several different things such as air, lubricant, cursing, but noting works. I am going to end up cutting it off because Jet Ski season is over up in the Northeast and I want to take the hitch off.UPDATE - I finally got the key in but couldn't turn it. Called the manufacturer to get some advice. They told me that it wasn't designed to stay on all the time...WHAT? I mean, come on, really? Shame shame shame...Oh, they did give me advise on how to cut it off. Really nice of them."
5,National Geographic Prehistoric Mammals,"A high-quality resource of ancient megafauna has been lacking for decades - that situation comes to an end with the publication of National Geographic Prehistoric Mammals. If you're a paleoartist or fan thereof, with interests extending beyond the age of dinosaurs, this is the book for you. The information is not painstakingly in-depth and there are some mistakes -- the smilodon did not go extinct 100,000 years ago; it was only 9,000, and humans certainly DID encounter them. The artwork, however, would be tough to improve on."
3,National Geographic Prehistoric Mammals,"In contrast to a previous book written by Alan Turner and illustrated by Muricio Anton, ""The Big Cats and their fossil relatives,"" This book disappoints. The artwork by Anton is excellent, but the text is superficial and light. A very nice coffee table book for the general reader, and perhaps a very good introduction for children, age 12 and older."
4,The recognisable familiar world in visual appearance of the astonishing prehistoric mammals,"National geographic have once again brought out and presented us readers with prehistoric mammals a recognisable familar world with stunningly breathtaking photograph-like illustrations that are like transporting you back in time machine but without anyneed to go anywhere and with all sorts of structural, size charts detailed profiles on each individual species and whole stack more scientific information which is interesting to read because it,s fascinating for reference in discovery of new worlds.Finally i would like to add that the only putoff to this book is that the scientific names are incorrect or to more naturally put it wrong because of it,s classification data but it is still nonetheless worth buying whether you borrow it or keep it for reading four and half stars from me."
4,Great book!,"This book is a great illustrated encyclopedia of prehistoric mammals. It seems to be designed for the six to sixteen year old set, but there are enough great pictures and the text is clear enough that my four year old son loves it too. Although it wasn't designed specifically to do so, it also fits in well with ""The Complete Guide to Prehistoric Life"" by Tim Haines, and the ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" videos."
1,It's a shame !,"SAXON was never a really big, big band, but without any doubt they left their mark in hard-rock / metal. They survived extinction along with Iron Maiden and Def Leppard. But I'd like to know who did the song selection for this compilation! HTis is absolutly not he best of Saxon ! The great songs from SAXON were written until the the album ""CRUSADER"". AFter that, they turned radio friendly and almost finished ! The songs in this selection (in their majority) has only their ""radio phase"" portrayed ! For old SAXON fans like myself, it's garbage."
4,Saxon / One of the top metal acts of the 80's,"Get REAL folks. Saxon was a great band of the era. Denim & leather is still one of my favorites.Strong Arm of the Law would be another.I agree that the song selection isn't what I would prefer,or you,or maybe even You,but someone musta liked them better than us,(songs).As far as Black Sabbath & Saxon,that's like apples and oranges ,isn't it? A better comparison would be to Y & T,Accept, Quiet Riot,their contemperaries. I think they measure up.And,like most the bands of that era ,their material,not their abilities brought them down.Another 80's Metal Act who couldn't make the 90's transition.Talent wasn't lacking. AC/DC, Judas Preist, Motorhead, they all lived to fight another day.All Saxon needs to do is go back to the type of music that got em paid.And it was GREAT !! Jerome Owens"
3,"Broken Heroes NOT studio, but live version","I was looking forward to this CD, but when I got it I found that Broken Heroes is a live version and not a studio version as listed on the release. I believe that I am entitled to my full purchase price back, but good luck getting that out of this site.Everything else on the CD is good, and this should've been a good way for SAXON fans to get material off those CDs that were not really up to snuff but had a few good singles on them."
3,"Fair compilation, but unwise choice of songs.","What is Scott Smith smoking? Saxon- bubble gum metal? I agree with the reviewer who said that most of the songs are from the ""pop-rock"" era of Saxon. I should also point out that NO METAL BAND EVER HAS WRITTEN ONLY HARD EDGED METAL SONGS. Even Metallica and Motorhead wrote some fairly ""mellow"" songs.Def Leppard are a Bubble gum ""metal"" band.By the way , Black Sabbath's lead singer was called Ozzy."
1,Sally Metal,I bought this CD used for $7.99 - What a waste! This is not heavy metal folks...The guitar riffs are upbeat and so predictable it's ridiculous. I can't see how this band has contributed to the heavy metal movement in any way. Calling this heavy metal would be the equivalent of playing the Partridge Family on a classic rock station! AVOID if you are a serious metal listener!
2,here we go again,"Will someone listen to me? I wrote the ""It's heavy- but heavy what?"" review. I repeat - Saxon started as basically a heavy rock n roll band, then turned ""radio friendly"", BUT HAVE NOW MADE A COMEBACK TO HARDER MATERIAL. Who clicked on the ""no"" button on my review? Saxon were almost as big as Maiden in the UK in the early 80's but were never huge worldwide, but this most definitely does not mean that they were inferior to more famous bands.Like it or not, image is a part of popular music, and it is perhaps here that Saxon had a weak spot-they didn't have a definite image like Iron Maiden had.FONESCA, if you haven't heard Saxons stuff post 91 I can recommend that you do.This album does have a few of their good songs on it but I agree that it's a bad compilation.I've been a Saxon fan since 1986 so I like to think that I know what I'm talking about."
2,Only few signs of the great Roxy Music,"Bryan Ferry fans and ex-fans belong to one of two: fans of the old Roxy Music from the 70's, or fans of the ""new"" Roxy Music and Ferry of the 80's. I belong to the first section, to those who don't understand what happened to the great promise after 1976. Solo albums of Ferry were never as good as the old Roxy Music. It seemed that Ferry brought to these albums lighter music, cover versions, and stuff that the rest of the members did'nt like. ""In your mind"" is one of them, but still you can find Roxy spirit in ""This is tommorow"" (listen to Manzaneras guitar), ""All night operator"" and the biggest hit of this album - ""Tokyo Joe"". That's why i give that album 2 stars and not less. The latest albums of the man would get -2 stars. On the other side, the earlier ""Lets stick together"" is much better."
3,Mainly a textbook,"I used this book for a history class, it was alright, difficult to read at times, but if you like history should be no problem for the history major."
3,Some of the songs are okay,"About half of the song selections are okay, others are uncommon as is the case with most books like this. No one seems to put together a selection of entirely recognizable songs from famous musicals. The vocalist is average, about what I expected. The CD does the trick if you are without a piano and accompanist."
4,Love it.. But..,"The grinder works very well. The grinding process builds static electricity and after running a few ""batches"" the grounds ""leap"" from the ""catch"" cup all over the face of the grinder when you remove the cup. Also, if I were to put as many coffee beans in the cup as the picture shows, the ""catch"" cup would not be able to hold all the grinds. 1/2 full of beans at medium to fine grind pretty much fills the finish product cup if you shake it or tap it down while grinding. Spillway clogs with buildup.. Not an ""easy clean up"" if you really want it clean and free of (fine particulate) bean material. Takes me as long to clean as it takes me to grind 3 batches."
4,Good Grinder,"The grinder was a Christmas present for my husband. He says it works very well, he uses it daily and he likes it. He did encounter a problem with putting it together (he accidentally put the blades in updside down and couldn't get them out). A phone call to the manufacturer fixed that easily enough."
5,Best burr grinder under $200?,"This purchase was made based on the many reviews I found on Amazon.com. To those of you who wrote reviews, I thank you most profusely; I would not have ended up as happy as I am had it not been for you. It is easy to use, easy to clean, easy to load, quiet, and the 16 grind settings allow for all the different grinds I use, from espresso to French press. From the first cup, I knew I had found the right grinder'. It is true that heat imparted from other burr grinders hurts the coffee. The quality of the machine is obvious from the first time I used it. 100% satisfied. Check back in a year and see what I say then! ***** out of five"
3,Cheap Plastic - not die cast zinc! Updated,"Shame on Amazon. Their description of this item is incorrect. It is made of plastic NOT die cast zinc as stated by Amazon. It probably makes sense to buy a cheaper model that will work as well. I may return this if I can find a conical burr grinder with a metal housing in this price range.Update 12/19/2012: Apparently the silver/stainless colored model has a die cast housing, but be aware the Amazon listing for the black model still states the black version has a die cast housing which is not true. It is plastic. Unfortunately I have already used this black model so I will not return it in order to get a zinc housing model.Please note I did not accuse Amazon of ""false advertising"" merely of being incorrect."
3,Dust everywhere,"I have used burr grinders for a number of years with many of the same complaints as others, especially the relatively short life span of the devices. However, the most egregious problem is the static electricity that it generated when I grind coffee. The result is that grounds cling to both the inside and outside of the grounds receptacle. The grounds even migrate to the outside of the unit itself."
2,Typical Italian Equipment,I purchased this grinder about 6 months ago along with a Moccamaster coffee maker.The former has been a troublesome addition to our kitchen. Coffee grinds somehow find their way into the inner works and prevent it from engaging the grinder gears. It then needs to be taken apart and cleaned out. This has happened about 20 times over the 6 months and caught me in the wrong mood this morning when I was looking forward to a quick cup of joe. It went straight into the garbage bin. I doubt I will buy Italian anything again after this and a previous Italian coffee maker which met a similar fate.
3,Messy and cheaply built,"I bought this in 2007, based on Amazon reviews. Here are some observations from the 5yrs its been in use:~Very messy. I use it by the sink because grinds build up between the container and main body and fall out when the container is removed. The static electricity also makes a small amount of grinds fly out of the container. The total of this does not add up to more than a teaspoon of grinds, but it is enough to make a mess.~Cheaply built. The grind adjustment is made by rotating the hopper which is made out of brittle plastic. Part of the hopper broke inside the unit during normal use and I can no longer adjust to the coarsest grind now.Like stated by others, it gives a nice even grind of coffee, but if I was to do it again, I would try to find a cheaper model of same build quality (ie. not pay so much for this one), or splurge for a better built/designed unit."
4,A bit of static and man is that plastic clear,"Use this at work for a group of french press and aeropress drinkers daily. Wonderful unit with consistent effective grinds at both ends of the spectrum. Static buildup is obvious with the course grinds. We solved by lining the plastic grounds bin with aluminum foil. Also, the bean holder broke along the bottom when a bean was stuck and someone went to remove it to to take it out. We received a new one in a couple of days at minimal cost. And remember...the top of the bean holder is clear so make sure it's off before you start pouring beans in or they'll go everywhere. And once filled, you can't take it off the unit without beans spilling out everywhere either. :-)"
5,"Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder, Black","My Daughter was thrilled to get such a big powerful grinder. The grinder she bought at a discount store broke after a week, so we went all the way and got her the best in a reasonable price range. Now she also grinds coffee beans for her brother who lives next door, we'll be purchasing another for him real soon! We received the grinder in record time. Thanks to all who made this possible."
4,Adequate for espresso,"I bought this predominantly as an inexpensive burr grinder to make espresso. With a great deal of trial and error, I found that the second bar of the fine setting is appropriate for me, despite the manufacturer's claim that espresso is in a medium setting range.The grinder is otherwise made of plastic but seems sturdy enough to meet my needs. The provided brush is inadequate for cleaning the grinder. Cleaning out the remaining grinds is often just a matter of tapping it out.There are better grinders to make espresso, however, the better ones are much higher in price. This product is a reasonable substitute if you are looking for a less expensive grinder which can make decent espresso."
3,Failed shortly after warranty expired,"A great coffee grinder for the amateur coffee enthusiast that fills the niche between cheap blade grinders and ridiculously expensive conical burr grinders. Note: I don't own an espresso machine, so this review is ONLY regarding grinds for coffee.Edit: Had to knock it down two stars, as it died a little over a year after purchase. Not sure if it was a fluke or abuse from a housemate, but I expect an investment like this to last at least 3 years for more. I stand by my initial review of the quality of the grind, but you may want to check if others have had similar product lifespan issues."
4,Well worth the money!!!,"I recently bought a pump espresso machine and needed a burr grinder to go with it. I researched as many reviews as I could find. This grinder lives up to its reviews! I've only had it about a month or so, but no issues thus far. The reviews said it's hard to clean, but it's not too bad. It's resonably quiet compared to our old blade grinder. I'd gladly give it 5 stars, but it's early yet."
4,both a 3and 5 star,"It grinds coffee quietly consistently and does not heat up beans. But the container that holds beans is cheaply made, and has a guard that is very easy to break, It is a grinder and should be sturdier, also it is a pain to clean. Good costumer service, But they will only replace one broken coffee holder after that it will cost $15.00 to replace although grinder works with out bean guard."
4,Good product!,"I plan to buy a second grinder like this. Finally, the grounds of the coffee do not collect at the base of the grinder. We tried a few others and they had to be returned. I am very happy with this."
4,Gift from the wife,"This grinder is a huge improvement over the cheap one we used to have.PROS: Consistently sized coffee groundsMuch quieter than the rotating flat blade designsCONS: There is a decent amount of ""dust"". When used in conjunction with a gold filter, the dust flows through the filter and makes the last few sips at the bottom of the pot really potent.Static electric build up between the burr wheels causes some of the grinds to get stuck in the chute and make a small mess as you remove and insert the ""grounds container"""
2,Cheap feel,The item seems to be working just fine (outputting a fairly consistent grind) but it is quite light and feels very cheap.
5,Greatly Improved Coffee Flavor! (Conical Burr Grinder vs. Blade),"I purchased a DeLonghi blade grinder from Amazon almost ten years ago, which was a big improvement over pre-ground coffee. Though I'm happy that the DeLonghi lasted so long, the conical burr grinder made such an ENORMOUS difference in the flavor of my morning Joe, I almost wish the DeLonghi had died sooner!! This grinder is very sturdy, but it also looks very stylish as a permanent addition to my counter. My only hope now is that it wears as well as the DeLonghi!"
4,nice grind,I like the ease of use. I like the high number of grind settings. I like the mechanical timing switch. The one thing that kept it from five stars is that it isn't really that easy to clean.
1,Requires cleaning after each use.,"This grinder is nice to look at, does a great job of grinding but requires cleaning of the mechanism after each use!. Buy the Breville conical grinder for 2/3 the price of this grinder. It is way more user friendly and does a suberb grinding job."
3,Not fine enough for my machine,"I have the Saeco Aroma espresso machine and this grinder just doesn't cut it for me. I used to use a cheap blade grinder, and while the grinds were not consistent, at least I was able to get it fine enough for my machine. Maybe mine was calibrated wrong, because even on the finest setting, it is still a little too course for my espresso. It works fine for other systems like french press or drip coffee.It also gets clogged up fairly quickly and needs a cleaning more often that I want to give it one. Lastly, if you put the portafilter directly under the stream of grinds (versus the plastic container), it gets messy. This listed feature is not so much of a feature as a later discovered cool thing that is sorta possible.I still gave it 3 stars because it is affordable and works fine for all but espresso or finer ground coffee beans. Also, it isn't nearly as big as I imagined."
2,Disappointed,"This product was suggested to us by the vendor in Hawaii from whom we order coffee when we decided to try beans instead of ground coffee, Initially we were happy with it. It was quiet and did a good job. We followed the cleaning and all other directions. There was considerable static electricity or whatever that kept the coffee in the container that collected the ground coffee but we could live with that. After less than 3 months of weekend only use, it ""froze up"" and we could not turn it to grind. Then, while attempting to unstick the dial, the plastic tooth broke off. It was totally unusable. I will say the company told us to contact them so they could ""talk us through"" repair. However when you spend that much ($100) for something, I expect better. Chose to discard and get a Kitchen Aid. Would NOT recommend."
4,Great for the value!!!,"Just recieved this product and after reviewing, searching, analyzing, reading a LOT of grinders, this is the one that costs less than 300USD and will give you PLENTY of option for grinding with a solid structure. It has 16 different options for grinding, obviously has a flaw and the only one y can see after having it for a month is that it is kind of difficult to clean inside to remove ALL of the coffee after grinded; but besides that IT IS THE BEST GRINDER FOR BEGINNERS."
4,"So far, a great grinder","I have a Breville Roma Cafe espresso machine and use my new Capresso stainless steel burr grinder at the middle setting of the ""fine grind"" to make great tasting lattes and cappucinos. I use only high quality beans. I follow the ""golden rule"" and get very nice crema every time. This is a substantial machine that is very quiet. The cleaning brush should be better which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."
5,Excellent Grinder,"I have been using the grinder for about six months now and am very pleased with all aspects of it. The grinder is quieter than others I have used and is extremely consistent. There is a wide range of settings which is good for me since I make everything from French Press to Turkish coffee.Some have complained that you need to clean out the burr/grinding portion often, but I do not find that to be the case. Only a small portion of the grounds are left over in the burr after each use and even if you don't clean it out very often the function is not impared.Additionally, the grinder came with an order form for replacement parts (i.e. burr, rubber sleve for the burr, hopper, etc.), and the prices are reasonable. Overall, I highly recommend this grinder."
2,Too difficult to clean..........................,"I read many reviews before purchasing this grinder. I wish people had indicated the difficulty and messiness in really cleaning it properly after each grinding - which is what the manufacturer recommends in the instructions. The reason I purchased this grinder was not only because it was well constructed and was a good quality burr grinder, but because it was one of the few burr grinders that could be cleaned. Not to clean it properly after each grinding simply allows the particles and oils from the ground beans to go stale and rancid. I am not adverse to taking time to clean things, but this was ridiculously tedious and messy! I'm now back to my small Krups/blade grinder (which although doesn't do as complete a job of slow even grinding) does clean beautifully in a few minutes and makes good enough fresh coffee in my french press. I'm disappointed in Capresso."
1,February 2011 Update,"Original Review:We have been grinding our own coffee for many years. When our last grinder, a Cuisanart, died after about three years we got the Capresso. This is by far the best coffee grinder we have ever owned. It is a quiet and smooth in operation. It is slower than our previous grinders but that is part of its smooth even grinding operation. The bean hopper could be larger or perhaps we should drink less coffee. Very happy with this purchase.Update ReviewThe Capresso 560 purchased February 14, 2009, Died February 13, 2011. That is not satisfactory for an $80 appliance."
3,No Value Added,"This may seem like a better deal than buying the grinder by itself as it adds a cleaner for apparently no extra price, but it's not. It's such a small amount of cleaner that it's useless, and because it isn't sent from Amazon there's no free shipping.The grinder though is great. An affordable well made conical burr."
2,Lasted a year before it broke,"Well, I got one year of use out of it before it broke, predictably, right where everyone else's broke. I won't buy another, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're OK with your $90 purchase being junk after one year - probably less than 200 uses. Seems it could be built better."
3,"grinds well, but irritating design flaws","pros: very nice range in grinds. i've used it all the way from very fine/fine for espresso to coarse for my french press. gave me the ability to tweak my grind to my liking.cons: i'm in agreement with most of the flaws mentioned in other reviews#1- the clear container does not fit tightly into the machine. vibrates off if not held in. the grounds collect behind the container and push it out even more. irritating.#2- the leftover grinds that do not fall into the container. so, a portion of your ""freshly ground coffee"" is actually stale. ( i get around this by tipping the machine forward after the grinding and giving it a good slap on the back. most of the grinds empty into the container). more irritating.#3- the timer is useless because it's not consistent! even when set to the same number every time, grind time and volume of grinds always varies! i end up estimating the grind time every morning based on the volume i see in the container. super irritating."
3,"Ehh, it's okay","The grinder does an okay job, but I have two complaints. First, you never really know how much coffee you're going to get. The ""timer"" function seems to be pretty inconsistent. I've worked around this by measuring the exact amount of beans for each grind session, but that's not optimal.My biggest complaint though is the plastic container that catches the grinds. As the machine is grinding, the vibration rattles the container out of it's base and if you don't push it back into place ever 10 seconds, it'll vibrate completely out and the grinds will pour all over the place. What a pain!"
5,Excellent grinder!,"This is a great coffee grinder. As things go it is fairly quiet, not silent, but not ear splitting either. It is heavy, so it doesn't move around on the counter. The ground coffee receptacle seems to be much more antistatic than my old burr grinder, which is a pleasure. The top of the been hopper is clear, and after one mess of trying to pour beans into a closed container, I applied a small decal. No more beans all over the kitchen. I use the machine for my french press, and on the course setting it works great. Only a little sediment. But that is a french press for you. I measure out my coffee beans every time, and grind them all, but I suppose you could store the beans in a full hopper and grind some with the timer switch, but that is not precise enough for most coffee geeks I know. Cleaning can be a problem, I suppose, but I solve it by not cleaning the thing very often. Well, actually at all. Seems to work fine. All in all, I would highly recommend this coffee maker."
3,"The grind is great, the mess not so much","The fact that the grind adjustments are easy to use and the machine has worked wonderfully since the day it was purchased is a real plus. I use it everyday BUT. . .it is so messy! The cansister for the ground coffee must be pushed completely into the unit or there will be grounds everywhere around the grinder. Even when it is pushed in properly there are still grounds that fall when you pull out the canister and have to be cleaned out of the canister area. Because of the design, cleaning up the area around this grinder will be a daily chore. I thought I could deal with the clean-up but it is starting to get rather annoying when there are other decent grinders that don't have this kind of design flaw."
1,Capresso 560 Burr Grinder,"The Capresso 560 Burr Grinder did a good job grinding beans. however, it would leave a large amount of ground coffee in the grinder that did not drop into the container. The worst part of the grinder is that it is easily broken. My wife did not get the bean holder properly seated in the grinder and the grinding blades are now frozen. We are unable to remove the blades or use the grinder after only one month of use."
4,Capresso grinder,"This Grinder makes great coffee. The grounds are even, etc.However, it is not as easy to clean as the Product Description states."
5,Fabulous Coffee Grinder!,"Fabulous! It performs consistently and the coffee is great.This Bean Grinder was purchased for an office of about 25 people so it gets alot of wear and tear. It replaces a different brand of burr grinder, which died after a couple of weeks. This one is going strong. We recommend it to other consumers."
5,excellent,The product performs as advertised. It is convenient to grind just the amount you need each time you make your expresso. Consequently your drink is fresh and flavorful.
3,Too much Static,"No matter what I did, the static using both oily beans and less oily (all very freshly roasted <2 weeks), the drawer would spew grinds and chaff all over my counter. I am guessing that the drawer itself created too much static when grinding. The grinds for french press and drip were OK, not perfectly consistent but good for the price. Would not do espresso or turkish grind though in my opinion. Nice timer and relatively quiet. If you are wanting an inexpensive grinder this at least beats a blade..."
2,"Was a great grinder, for a month","I received a gift card for my birthday at the end of November. I have been wanting a coffee grinder for months and have been on amazon just as long looking at review after review. Finally, I found one that had fairly good reviews so I ordered it. It worked wonderfully for a month. Had great uniform grind, did not have a problem with static as I had read in so many reviews and it was not loud. The only problem is it just quit grinding one day. Thank goodness for amazons excellent return policy! Now, to find one that lasts longer than a month, or 6 months... Very disappointed in this grinder and manufacturer."
3,About what I would expect from a sub $100 Burr Grinder,"Pros- Seems very well made, even though it uses a lot of plastic (what doesn't)- Grinds great, they state the burrs are commercial grade and they seem to be well made.Cons- The grounds container is plastic and static causes the grounds to cling everywhere, kind of annoying.- I have to tap on the machine several times to get all the grounds out, not a big deal for me- To adjust the grind setting you turn the hopper, there is a lot of play when you change direction, so your grind setting won't be exact if changed or you remove the hopper. This clunky to me.This machine grinds how I would expect, for the price I can deal with the grind setting and static cling. If you can't I would consider the higher dollar alternatives, like the breville."
4,"Great Product, Right Price","If you have a billion dollars to blow, go for it. For the rest of us plebians this is more than sufficient."
1,grounds fly all over the place; broke within two months,"I had an old version of this maker, which I would give 3 starts -- it ground the coffee, but it always made a mess. I swore, when it broke, I'd buy a different model. Alas, it broke when I had a house guest who kindly replaced it (!). This one got grounds all over the place; the coffee constantly clogged the chamber, requiring a lot of turning it upside down and spanking it -- which wastes a lot of coffee. Now, this one has broken -- after only 2 months."
5,cleanup simple with compressed air,"This is my first experience with a burr grinder and I'm very satisfied. The fit and finish was as expected. The stainless steel version makes for a heavy-duty appliance. Setup and use was simple and the directions were very straightforward. I used it for a french press grind and it turned out perfect.My only hangup in ordering this was the fear of a nasty cleanup after every use. It comes with a little brush that is sufficient to get into the crevices, but instead I used a few squirts from a can of compressed air."
5,Love it!,"I researched a lot of grinders, I didn't want to spend more than $100 or so. My last one (different brand)smelled like a hot motor all the time, it was really hard to stop it when the catch container was full, and it gave out within 3 months. I roast and grind 5 to 10 lbs. a week. I guess it couldn't handle that much. The Capresso 565 Stainless Steel has been wonderful! It's very quiet, easy to adjust the grind, easy to turn it off when you want to stop it half way through the grinding process, easy to take it apart to clean, I could keep going, but I won't! Thanks Capresso!"
3,Does OK,I use this grinder quite a bit. Reading the other reviews will help you avoid some of the problems that you might encounter using it. It does a good job at grinding. My biggest complaint is the container the grounds fall into just isn't as snug of a fit as it should be and can vibrate out while in the grind mode if you don't watch it. Not a big deal but messy.
5,Capresso Infinity Burr coffee grinder,"Works very well - bought this for my wife for a Christmas present, and as a coffee lover she is very pleased with it. Gives a reliable grind every time, even one cup at a time."
4,Bella Cucina Blender,"This blender is very functional and practical because unlike the larger blenders, it is easy to use and easy to clean. The only negative (and it's a small one) is that the rubber ""O"" ring (part of the blade piece) does come loose after multiple washings. The ""O"" ring needs to be attached to the blade piece or it will be impossible to unscrew the blade from the cup."
2,Forget it if you enjoy expresso,"This machine does not produce a grind fine enough for expresso machines like the Rancilio Silvia (mine). If you follow the 20-25 seconds rule for extraction time, forget about purchasing this item. The coffee will come out the portafilter way too fast."
2,Disappointing grinder -Coarse grind,"I always use the highest setting for grinding, but it comes out very coarse. I have to finish grinding my coffee in a blade grinder to use it in my espresso machine. Otherwise, the coffee comes out completely white. I did not go for a cheaper grinder thinking I could invest a bit more a get a better product, but this was a waste of money."
2,Design flaws--I returned it,"I got this to grind just once, and the coffee I made was very very good. Then I could never get it to grind again--I just couldn't get the top to align properly so that I could set the grind setting.Also cleaning was not quick and easy. The grinds fell all through the machine, requiring it to be taken apart and each part wiped, to prevent the grounds from going rancid and affecting taste down the road."
4,"Once you go burr, you never go back....","This was my first experience with a burr grinder, having previously relied on my trusty blade grinder. What a difference in results. The grind is always uniform, especially in the finer settings. This was impossible with the blade grinder. I read the reviews here carefully before selecting this model, and have not been disappointed. Clean-up-- which you must do regularly and which I do daily--is a bit tedious, but it quickly becomes routine. The brush provided with the unit is wholly inadequate to this task, so you might want to find a better one."
2,Better tasting coffee.,I did some research and decided a burr grinder was the only way to go for freshly ground coffee. I also recommend using a natural bristle car detailing brush for cleaning since it must be cleaned after each use and the brush supplied by the manufacturer is not very useful.Added 03/25/09: plastic hopper breaks easily and renders unit useless. Two (2) Stars our of five !
3,it's good,"Seems to create a pretty even grind. There are 16 settings between extra fine and coarse. The only thing I don't like about it is the grind setting are not predicably accurate. Also there is no guide on the grind size setter that related grind size with what kind of coffee your brewing. So if you don't at least have an idea of how fine or coarse you want your coffee for say French press, drip or espresso then you might be a little lost."
4,Worth the money,"Not cheap, but not the most expensive either and it does the job well... But the hopper that holds the coffee is indeed pretty flimsy. I think I remember someone else saying that on their review... in fact mine already had the bottom start to detach. I had to glue it back on to keep from getting ground coffee every where. That my only complaint and the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars... definitely can taste the difference between coffee ground in a burr grinder compared to a blade..."
5,excellent grinder,"overall, great in grinding espresso and drip grind. coffee tastes better than with my gaggia burr grinder. i strongly recommend it."
3,Works But It Is Very Messy,"There is nothing wrong with the product functionally. It works well. It grinds the beans. However, clean up takes forever. It is very messy. It's an ordeal every time we grind, so I try to do all the grinding at one time. Additionally, the on/off switch/knob operates like a timer. So, while you're grinding the timer turns off frequently before it's done. Then you just have to turn it on again. Seems like a silly way to turn the unit on or off. In the end, it grinds the beans well. I've owned it now for about 4 weeks and have ground coffee beans with it 3-4 times."
3,MESSY,Works fine for the coffee but static electricity and maybe some design flaws make coffee grounds scatter each time the container is removed. We clean coffee grounds from the floor and cabinet daily. Never happened with cheaper Cuisinart. Otherwise satisfied.
4,"Love, love, love this burr grinder","....and love Capresso's customer service person, who ON A WEEKEND, mind you, talked me off the ledge and helped me fix my grinder. I had disassembled it to clean it and put the upper burr in upside down. There was a fancy little maneuver I had to do with a butter knife to align the lower burr correctly. Fabulous---saved me from running out to buy another. Three years since purchase, countless delicious cups of coffee later, newly repaired (by me) this machine is still going strong. Will never use a blade grinder again."
3,"Great at first, but...","We LOVED this grinder when we used it for the first week. It grinds superbly, and the coffee tastes better than ever, and the horrible burned smell that my husband's espresso maker always had when he was using it completely went away. But some time during the second week, the ground coffee started getting more and more stuck to the sides of the grinder's plastic container that they are ground into by static electricity. It has now become impossible to pour them from the container into the coffee maker's basket, without making a HUGE mess everywhere! Some of the ground coffee now actually leaps out of the container and all over my hand as I try to pour it in. What a nightmare!!! We have tried washing the container, tapping the container (as it says in the owner's manual), and we've even tried using a magnet to de-static it, but nothing has helped. Does anyone have any advice? Many thanks!"
4,Don't think a five star grinder exists but this comes close.,"I've tried so many and even the high dollar ones are not what you hope for. This one will grind even the dark oil covered beans well without a peep unlike most. It's quieter than most but not as quiet as it could be. The only real complaint is that the little pull out cup tends to walk out during the grinding causing a mess from grounds flying out, so you have to hold it in with your finger while grinding or use a rubber band. Also because the cup is plastic it tends to build up static electricity so if you don't let it sit a minute or so before pulling out the cup, grounds fly out. Still, it's a better grinder than all the more expensive models and cheaper, and there is no comparison with the cheaper / others in the same price range. Until I find a better or five star one, This ones the bomb."
4,great upgrade,Love my new Capresso. I had a Cuisinart burr grinder for almost 10 years. It was so LOUD. I had the kids cover their ears and the static was unbearable. Plus many plastic parts were broken. The Capresso is quiet with little static. I love the heavy stainless quality. The course is not as course as the Cuisinart but works great for a french press. Perfect actually. Follow all the directions in the package and you should have no trouble with little assembly and cleaning.
2,Beware this grinder,"I had mine for about two weeks. It performed very well as far as grinding the beans and the consistency of the bean grind. A couple of things that should be noted, however; you constantly have to remove the plastic bean container to clean the burr housing. If you don't, old grinded beans will accumulate. Another really bad feature of this particular conical burr grinder: mine was ruined the last time I lifted the plastic housing and removed the burr grinder part of the machine. I still can't figure out how it happened, but, it was IMPOSSIBLE to re-mount the plastic bean bin after I had removed the burr housing and re-inserted it after cleaning. The burr housing could NOT be removed again without jamming a screwdriver into it to PRY it out. After I DID get it out and re-inserted it, the plastic bean bin WOULD NOT go back in. It was totally inoperable. In disgust, I threw the whole thing away and ordered a DIFFERENT brand. This grinder is very fragile. I would not buy another one."
2,OK while it lasted,"Pretty good grind. Nice fluffy coffee, good grind range. Plastic top broke when trying to remove it, destined for the landfill. $89 comes to about a dollar per use.I think I'll buy a grinder that is made to last. The Capresso 560.01 sure isn't made to last."
1,"broken, not like new. useless.","I recently purchased a capresso infinity burr mill and was using it quite happily on the coarse settings but when i went to grind a finer espresso the machine would not turn on, after inspection i realized that the little piece of plastic that hold some mechanism down to let the machine know the bean hopper is in place, was broken off."
4,Good grinder,Decent grinder for the money. I needed something that could do a consistent coarse grind for press. Seems to do the job - and I didn't have to pay $800.00 for it.
4,Coffee grinder,"It grinds coffee well, but leaves coffee in its mechanism. There should be an easy method for getting all of the coffee out of the grinder. I use it daily and am happy with the quality of grounds."
4,Good grinder with limitations,I was looking for a burr grinder that would produce an even grind for french press. This grinder produces a relatively even grind when set on the largest setting - not as consistent as I was hoping but well worth the money! I do not have any experience with the smaller settings.The one drawback to the Capresso Burr Grinder is the static on the ground coffee container is much more than expected and there is a significant amount of ground coffee left in the grinder and chute. The tiny little brush included is not sufficient to clean the grinder - I end up taking the grinder blade out and shaking the grinder over the sink then cleaning the parts with a brush.
2,Do not buy this grinder,"It grinds well, but after a month, it just stopped working. I actually heard the motor slow down and then stop. Also, even while I did use it, there is a horrible static problem, so your when you pull the coffee grind holder out, coffee grinds spray all over the counter. Every time I used this, it made a big mess."
4,Really good (but not for Australians!),I made the error of buying an American appliance for use in Australia - power supply is different and blew the motor. For the one grind that it did manage to survive it did a really good job though.Would be good if you had the option to grind directly into the group handle like some other grinders do though.
5,"Had mine for two years, and still love it.","I have an espresso machine, a drip coffeemaker, and a pour-over rig for single cups. My grinder gets a lot of use and it performs flawlessly. Highly recommended."
4,The only way to go,"If you spend $12 to $15 for a 340 gram package of coffee like I do, then it makes a lot of sense to buy a dependable burr grinder like this one.But...grinding really loads up the static electricity in the unit. If you remove the hopper right after grinding, the fine grinds seem to blow out and stick all over the front of the unit. (a small nuisance)Maybe there's no fix for this.??"
5,Capresso Burr Grinder - excels,"Consistent, high quality grind vs. the blade grinder. Quiet, quicker, and smooth to use. Also, no mess as the grounds are well contained in the receiver."
2,Disappointed,"This grinder was good in producing an evenly ground product. Reasonably quiet. However, in grinding a rich soft bean (pure Kona) it clogs and cakes around the burr. If you do not clean at least every two days or so. a buildup of grounds begins that will soon kill the machine. Do buy the guarantee sold as an extra on Amazon or go elsewhere."
5,Great Product,"This grinder is quiet, efficient and compact. It looks nice sitting on our kitchen counter and we just love fresh ground coffee each morning. Easy to clean. Well worth every penny."
2,poor customer service,"found small spring in grinding chamber, called customer service numberand got no answer, sent e-mail got no response, wanted to put it were it belonged or see if it was as accident. grinder is working, lot of coffee grounds fly out though"
2,Would be a great product...,"...if not for one massive design flaw. The first time you insert the plastic basket, it's unclear exactly how it goes in, and the basket cracks very easily from improper insertion, even with very light pressure, as the plastic is very fragile and thin.The company does include an insert warning you of this, but I did not see it until too late. I know writing a review like this makes me sound like ""that guy,"" but at least be wary of this potential problem if you choose to buy this grinder."
2,I almost loved it...,"I loved this grinder when I first received it as a wedding present. Well, not at first. the first time I used it, the plastic chamber that holds the beans broke. It's very finicky so you have to line up the dots correctly and push very gently. After I received my replacement (Thank you, Amazon), I loved my machine for many months of lovely, delicious coffee grinding. It was simple, fast, and did the job with very little mess. Then I went on a caffeine hiatus and my lovely grinder was sentenced to the cupboard for a few months. I took it out to get back into the grind the other day, and nothing. It ground about a tablespoon of coffee in a minute. I have taken it apart several times, cleaned it, brushed it and inspected every portion of it. I have no idea why it won't grind coffee. The motor still runs fine, but no coffee comes through. I'm frustrated and I'm about to go by a cheap replacement to get me by. So- it worked great for about 10 months, and now I'm out a grinder."
1,capresso burr grinder,"This is the worse grinder I have ever owned, I bought it because I like the Capresso Coffee Maker. It is hard to clean.Also the counter has to be cleaned after each use."
2,No thanks,"This grinder is so noisy and so messy it's not worth the money! It grinds very well but the container that you grind into is removed from the grinder and the grounds go everywhere (poor design). I have to hold it over the sink, pat the sides down to get all the grounds, then pour it into my coffee maker. Then wash my hands and clean the sink. Plus we have to grind the beans the night before so we don't wake everyone in the house in the morning!"
1,Jams with coffee every day,I bought this thinking I could make super-fine espresso. Unfortunately I waste more coffee by having to clean out the chute every day. This machine is not worth $10.It worked great for about 2 months and I cleaned it according to the manual every weekend. After about 2 months coffee would start jamming in the chute.I guess it's back to my Black & Decker.
4,burr grinder arrives damaged,"the grinder works just fine. however, it arrived with a broken bean holder. it still grinds so i didnt want to go through the hassle of trying to return the whole package for just a replacement plastic piece."
4,"CAPRESSO 565 burr coffee mill, Stainless Steel","The unit is the stainless steel version of the 560.1 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder. It seems to be very well made and it takes up relatively little space on my counter beside my coffee maker and mug rack. Sad to say, I have NOT yet used it, because I am using up all my stockpile of ground coffee first. However, just by look, feel & test of burrs, this seems to be a very well made unit and way lower in price than the next step up... Since it has not been tested on actual beans, I am only giving 4 stars at this point."
1,Dont buy it...,"I bought this item through Amazon and after the first use it got all rusted,I cant use it any more.don't buy this item, it doesn't worth it!!!!!"
4,Grinder Review,This grinder works ok. The coffee comes out ground fine to coarse depending on the setting you choose. The grinder comes apart for cleaning and cleans up well. Using this grinder beats using a hammer to grind your coffee beans.
1,Never got it started,I wanted to like this machine and was excited to receive it. Unfortunately the top wouldn't fit properly into the base and it had to be returned. I'm ordering a different brand today.
1,Customer Service???,"The only thing worse than this grinder was their customer service. Cleaning the machine as suggested by the mfg. was a total pain. Reassembly was not an easy task either. After three or four cleanings (two days after expiration of Amazon return) I experienced difficulty with the attachment of the bean container. I called Capresso for help, on hold for 12 minutes, and then prompted to leave my phone number for a call back from CS. No call back. Repeated this process two more times with same results. Emailed twice explaining the lack of customer support. No replys. I would never buy another product from this mfg!!!"
1,Unreliable,"I had read many positive reviews of this grinder's performance and I have to say that while it was working it worked very well, although the grinding mechanism clogged up very quickly. After 5-6 uses the motor died completely. Amazon was awesome and agreed to take it back so I did not have any experience with Capresso and their warranty service. Although this is only one instance I think combined with some other's experience I cannot recommend this grinder due to build quality and poor reliability."
3,Not fool proof engineering,"I purchased the Capresso 560 Burr Grinder about 3 months ago. It performed as it should grinding coffee from extra fine to Course. I removed the upper grinder to brush the grind powder off for best flavor in my coffee. I am not sure how it happened, but I couldn't get the receptacle bowl back on and the upper grinder could not again be removed. I made an error and removed the auger screw. This caused the 3 bearings that sit on 3 springs to fall out of position. I called Capresso who informed me that I voided the warranty and it could not be fixed. The company will replace for reduced cost from full retail. Writing this review to let others know NOT to tinker with auger screw or risk ruining the unit and voiding the warranty."
1,cheap,"too many parts, too much cleaning, just a big pain in the butt that you'll never use and if you do use it, you'll spend half of the rest of your life cleaning it every use so you don't have stale tasting coffee leftovers in it. I have a hand grinder now that is very simple to use and clean."
1,Disappointed!!,I was not happy at all as the plug was American style and not able to alter for use in England.Has cost me 67 for the experience and that's with an immediate return of the grinder.Will be very cautious in the future!!!
2,Messy and Hard to Clean,"I was very disapponted in the grinder, especially after reading the many positive reviews.It was returned after three attempts to make it work satisfactorily.1. Grounds fall behind the receptacle and were difficult to remove. (Yes, the receptacle was in the proper place.)2. Timer has to be reset when attempting to grind 8 oz.. You have to wait until the timer counts down, even if all of the beans have been ground.3. Clogs easily and difficult and messy to unclog."
5,Great grinder for the $$ and for French Press use,"I was ready to step up to fresh ground coffee to use in my French Press, so I decided to go for a nice mid-range priced burr grinder and chose the Capresso Infinity. I checked out many reviews, both on Amazon as well as some coffee-centric sites, and decided that for this use the Capresso would be a good choice. I have only used this grinder for my French Press thus far, and for this use it works great. This grinder does a nice job of producing an even sized grind so you don't have dust and boulder sized coffee like a blade grinder produces. I would definitely recommend this grinder for someone looking for an upgrade from a blade grinder or a nice entry burr grinder. I have not used this for an espresso grind so I cannot comment on using this grinder for that purpose. Have to say fresh ground coffee makes a BIG difference. Enjoy."
4,Burr Grinder,"A very good grinder with acceptable uniformnity. For the price, this is as good as you can expect. It's actually better than some more expensive ones I know or have used. The best features are: No static clink, Easy to take apart, Rugged, Relatively quiet; Least desirable features: Grind settings, ""Auto"" timer;"
4,burr grinder,"I reviewed and reviewed all info I could find on burr grinders and finally narrowed it down to two. I bought the Capresso 560.01 and I am quite satisfied with it. As per other customers, the only complaint would be the static that is produced, which in turn, causes coffee to fall on the counter top when the ground coffee is removed."
3,Good grinder but horrible static.,"The grinder works flawlessly but there's so much static buildup from the device that it's a complete mess after grinding your beans. They stick to the catch bin, the sides of the machine, the top of the machine.. Basically everywhere; even on a semi-coarse cut. I can't even imagine how bad it would be on a fine/espresso cut.If I had to do it again I'd have saved the $100 & kept my bullet-style blade grinder. Easier to clean, less counter space & a lot less mess."
3,capresso grinder,"I searcehd for a long time for a good coffee bean grinder that had several settings and would hold more that 1/4 cup of beans. The only draw back is it is messy when you pull out the chamber that holds the ground coffee. Mine flys the ground coffee all over the place. If I only used it once in awhile, I could put up with it, but I use it a couple times a week, so I'm off searching for a different grinder."
2,"Capresso, grinding, but only if you need expresso...not impressed","I purchased both the capresso, and the breville conical burr grinder...the breville in my opinion blows this one away...First off, the capresso only has a timer switch ...to turn it off you either wait till it counts down to 0 or move it manually, no on off switch...its noisy....and it grinds uniformly..if thats what you need. It will also grind finer if you make expresso than the breville. But the breville is quieter...it has a start button and it auto shuts off, when it finishes grinding...it also has a timer....the hopper that holds the grounds on the breville is smaller, but it looks nicer than the capresso...which for my purposes didnt work out well"
2,Returned it,"I've been researching moderate (less than $750) espresso outfits. You know, more than a steam pot but still moderately priced. From what I've read the burr grinder is as important (some claim more important) than the espresso machine. Even still I tried the Capresso Infinity due to it's low price but returned it a couple days later. Here's why:- Plastic, meaning static cling meaning messy.- Grind left over, as others have pointed out (I should have listened). I tried bumping and tilting the grinder as suggested here but the grinder just didn't feel like it would take the added abuse very long.I'm talking about the black plastic model, not the stainless steel model so I don't know if it would be tougher. I splurged and bought the Rancilio Rocky Doserless Espresso And General Purpose Coffee Grinder instead and let me tell you it is SOLID, not a cheap plastic feel. I'm very happy with the Rocky!"
2,Good as long as it lasts,"I liked this grinder. It was not very noisy, gave a consistent grind and was not messy. Unfortunately it stopped working after about three months of use."
4,Happy With This Grinder,"I did a lot of checking and reading reviews for this and comparing it to other grinders. I wanted more consistent grinds mainly for french press. I'm very happy with it. It makes very consistent grinds and it is easy to use. For the people that complain about the mess I would say it's a coffee grinder, of course there is a bit of a mess! My experience is that any coffee grounds that get around from static are very minor, though. Not a problem for me. Clean up is easy, too. My advice for those buying it would be to take a few seconds to read the directions, especially in regards to turning off the timer, so you don't damage it. I suppose I could have paid twice as much or more for a better grinder, but from what I've seen out there the advantages would be very minor."
4,Worthwhile,It may be myimagination but the coffee seems to be better since we started using this product. Much better that the choppy type of bean grinder.
1,Never grinds fine enough for espresso,Leaves too much ground coffee in the housing(poor design). Never ground fine enough for espresso . Grind is uneven. No shut-off switch. Cannot grind Extra Fine despite the setting being present. If you r using espresso machine avoid this unit. It might be ok to use this grinder for drippers.
5,The Capresso Burr Grinder is Fabulous !,"I just received this grinder a couple days ago and just love it. My Kitchenaid burr grinder died, so I wanted/needed a better than replacement. So far, after a couple bags of bean testing, this grinder is fantastic. The grindings have been consistent, and you need to know I've wasted some beans playing with this thing. I have to agree with other owners of this grinder, Capresso needs to do some more work on their instructions. I'm a trainer, and these instructions could be so much more. But as far as the unit itself...so far so so good, both the operation and the coffee. I'll update after a month."
4,Capresso 565 grinder,Grinding is much better than previous grinders. All grounds are uniform in size and the machine is not too noisy.the only complaint is the catch bin is too small for the size of the hopper which caused a mess the first time I used it.
5,Good workhorse coffee,"I've had one of these for several years and am purchasing a second one for a vacation home. It's not too noisy, doesn't clog, and grinds evenly."
3,Design needs work,"The coffee beans were grounded perfectly, my only issue with this machine was the container that holds your coffee once its ground. When you pull it out to pour the coffee it spills all over."
4,good grinder,unit works fine. grinding burrs aren't left completely clean after a grind but such a small amount I am not concerned.
4,Keep it clean!,"Grinder works well, but it is IMPERATIVE to clean it after each and every use, otherwise it will plug up especially if you are using fine grind, as in espresso. I have had other grinders that are more forgiving. So, although it does work well, it is somewhat high maintenance."
5,An execelent low-volume grinder,"This is a great grinder to use for home or a small office. The grind is quick and quieter than other grinders I've tried. And most importantly the grind size is very consistent. No coffee powder in your coarser grinds, and the fine grinds are very even too! There is a big difference in going to the conical burr grinder over just about anything else that you can get in this size. If you can't afford this one, check out the Capresso Infinity 560.01 which is made of a plastic housing instead of metal (and doesn't need a grounded plug either if that's an issue)."
2,Fragile plastic hopper is not for me,Perhaps I am unusually clumsy in the mornings but I used this grinder for only a couple of months before the base of the bean container snapped. I ordered another one. I've been unable to unjam the grinder from the position it was in when the first basket failed. I read several reviews mentioning an issue with the design so tried to be extra careful when cleaning the grinder. While it worked I thought it did a fine job. The design is unforgiving of user error and I have gone back to my old burr grinder. This isn't one for old ladies with arthritis who love good coffee.
5,No-compromise grinder at an affordable price,"The Capresso delivers exactly what it promises: a commercial-grade, conical burr grinder at a very reasonable price. I previously owned a basic Krups burr grinder, which was reliable and a definite step up from a blade grinder. But the Capresso offers substantially better performance for not much more money. With the reduction gearing it is quieter, and the conical burrs deliver a more consistent grind. I generally use a stovetop espresso maker; if the grind isn't uniform there ends up being a lot of ""dust"" in the coffee. With the Capresso, there is very little dust. And after several months of daily use, it shows every sign of being a very durable machine. It's easy to clean as well. If you want a top-notch grinder and don't want to spend hundreds of dollars, the Capresso is a great choice."
4,Decent cheap burr grinder,"I don't like the design of the grounds catcher as much as the Solis Maestro/Virtuoso grinders in the same class because the Capresso's shape makes it difficult to transfer to an espresso portabasket, but it has a fine range of grind settings that will work to produce a very good espresso - the real test of a quality grinder. It's an excellent value for the price."
5,Great Machine,"I have owned this grinder for over two years. I bought it from Amazon. I had gotten the metal grinder rather than the plastic. Easier to clean. This grinder is well made, simple to use, and the grind is always so consistent. There are cheaper ones out there and then there are more expensive. As far as I'm concerned, for the money, this is the best. However, like several people have pointed out, you have to make sure that the dots are lined up when inserting the bean hopper and turn it very slowly."
4,Capresso Infinity Burr Grinder,"This is a nice entry level product. It grinds well and is fairly easy to clean. It seems to be built well as is serving me fine. It could be better only in that it were to be quieter and that the last bit of grounds did not get caught up in the chute. These ""problems"" are minute and should not stop you from buying this product. It's a great entry level grinder and for the price you can't beat it."
5,Great product -- why pay more?,It gets the job done. I have been using mine for the past several months. Never had a problem with it.
2,"Worked fine from April 2011 to February 2012, then died.","Worked really well for ten months. Did a good job grinding coarse grounds for a french press.Then Monday morning it suddenly didn't work. We would turn it on and nothing would happen. It hadn't moved from the same spot on the counter for months, so we have no idea what went wrong.$89 is far too expensive for a disposable grinder.I would NOT buy this again.Yesterday I bought thisHamilton Beach 80374 Custom Grind Hands-Free Coffee Grinder, Black.Not as nice, but it's less than 1/3 the price. Hopefully it lasts more than year."
4,Solid grinder,"I've been using this grinder for about two years now and have been quite happy with it. The only things that come to mind that prevent me from giving it a 5-star rating are the facts that (1) the plastic container into which the coffee grinds fall tends to have static that keeps some of the grinds clinging to the sides of the container and (2) the finest grind isn't as fine as Turkish coffee, for the occasions where I've been inclined to have that style of coffee. Otherwise, it consistently gives me a uniform grind. The stainless steal model looks great beside my other stainless steel appliances, too."
4,"Good, but not as good","I have the next higher model of this grinder at my house. This one was purchased as a gift for a friend. My grinder is much quieter than this one, but it still grinds coffee VERY accuratly and the grinds are consistant and smooth."
5,Great Grinder,"Really love this grinder. Easy to use. The big hopper makes it even easier. Great coffee. Price at Amazon made it a good deal, too."
2,motor bound up,"It worked very well at first. After about a year of use, only on Saturday and Sunday, the motor bound up. It's just a paperweight now."
3,"A good grinder, but needs improvement","This is a fine coffee grinder. It produces a better grind than the whirling-blade type that I'd used for years and is far neater to use. My one complaint is that the plastic hopper and lid are too fragile. I've had to replace both because of falls from a low table. There are tough, impact resistant plastics that could be used."
3,Must Be A Better Way,"Never having previously used a burr grinder I can now confirm that it is far superior to a common blade grinder for providing a consistently smooth and flavorful grind.However, this grinder does leave a mess of grinds caught up in the burrs and lodge in the tiny chute where the ground beans fall into the hopper. It is truly a pain to keep clean. This may be common for burr grinders but I have to believe a better design would make for easier clean up and a less wasteful operation.As many have stated here one can easily break the bean container as it appears the plastic is far too likely to break even with cautious use."
1,What a mess this thing makes.,"After my Capresso 555 coffee grinder died, I naturally looked to buy another Capresso as a replacement since I liked the old Capresso so much.This Capresso Infinity costs twice as much and makes twice the mess on the countertop.One big engineering flaw... the clear plastic container the coffee discharges into migrates out of the machine during the grinding process... what a mess that makes! I always have to remember to place something heavy in front of it to hold it in.I never had a static problem grinding coffee in my old Capresso, but this Capresso Infinity certainly has static. I find that tapping on the container to discharge static helps a little... and waiting an hour or so before removing the basket also helps... but, who wants to wait an hour to brew coffee?No matter what I do, the ground coffee just hops out of the container like a bunch of fleas. I never had anything to clean up with my old Capresso, but this Capresso Infinity makes way too much mess."
4,Very happy with the grinder,"We got this for Christmas and have only used it twice so far. We can tell the difference in the coffee, which tastes great.The steel grinding burrs and infinite grind adjustments are good features.Recommend this"
4,I really like it.,"Length:: 0:33 MinsI've never had a burr grinder, so I can't compare. This however is far and a way better than my blade grinder. Hopefully it will last a long time. There doesn't seem to be much difference in the grinds of the different settings. The course is obviously more coarse than the fine. But, there doesn't seem to be much difference in the various course settings, the all seem to be about the same. I've uploaded a video of the grinder in action."
5,Quiet and Effective,"I'm going to keep it short. In the world of coffee grinders, every coffee snob (not necessarily bad.. you know who I'm talking about) will tell you that you need to spend 300 bucks on a grinder... blah blah blah. This thing is a head above anything you'll find in its price range, and is great at what it does. I would advise to cleaning often if you do espresso grinds with any sort of regularity, but that's a step up from some grinders where I've literally needed to clean after every grind. Works great, and best of all, its very quiet as grinders go!"
2,Not a fan,"I bought this grinder with high hopes based on the positive reviews, but find that the static problem is a deal breaker. I grind at the coarsest setting for cold water process coffee since the acidity is lower that way. This grinder creates very fine flakes that fly around when I remove the holder, and that cling to every part of the grinder. Not only should I not have fine flakes, but the static makes cleaning very hard. I cannot imagine doing this every morning! I will be returning this one."
4,"Works well. Sloppy design work makes it messy, though.","The machine grinds well, is fairly easy to use, is very easy to adjust for different grind sizes, and isn't especially loud.However, it drops some coffee grounds into the well where the bin goes (they don't all end up in the bin). These end up on the counter or wherever the machine gets stored.Worse, if the weather is dry, it builds up static electricity in the bin, so that upon opening, some of the grounds poof into the air. These end up settling over a range of many inches of the counter. That could have been avoided with a better bin design."
5,Great grinder for the price.,"Great grinder: easy to use, easy to clean, the 16 grind options adequately meets our needs and is much quieter than our previous grinder."
3,Efficient but very messy.,This grinder is somewhat quiet and very efficient but it takes about five minutes to clean everyday after I grind the beans. I am not convinced that the improvement in the flavor of the coffee is that much more superior to justify the time and money over a blade grinder. I did a taste test using my blade grinder to make one cup of coffee and this grinder to make the other coffee. I tasted little difference.
2,Inconsistent grind NOT FOR ESPRESSO,"If you have a decent espresso machine: gaggia, silivia, etc. this is NOT the machine for you. The finest grind is unable to produce any more than a 9 second shot in my Gaggia Baby; take info consideration I roast my own beans and any matter of tamping from none to ~50lbs.Overall: Great for drip coffee, horrible for any quality espresso machine."
1,"Design bad, construction worse.","This thing has never worked properly. With mine, you have to keep your hand on top or it stops grinding, and even then you have to jiggle your hand around til you are pressing it at the exact angle that makes it happy. I even replaced the bean container, and the fault remained.The device is really plasticky, and the timer user interface is lame - it would make much more sense if there was just a button you press.The shape of the container the ground coffee drops into is awkward - it's such an irregular shape that it's impossible to scoop everything out, or pour the whole contents into your espresso machine's portafilter without spilling coffee everywhere. The grind fineness is hard to adjust and involves using the bean container itself as a knob.Overall, this machine sucks. Sure it grinds your coffee, but so do other machines without all these annoying problems."
3,Great Grind,"This grinder does a great job grinding coffee. It's consistent, flexible, and not too loud. Having the stainless steel body is definitely worth the extra money.BUT, the grinder timer mechanism is a bit cheap. It's just a basic mechanical timer. Other grinder I've owned in the past have had a start/stop button with maybe some sort of knob to control their auto run time.Overall, the solid grinding job overshadows the timer flaw, but I've owned nicer grinders at this price point."
5,Great Little Grinder,"We bought this after our Starbucks (Estro 480 made by Saeco, as I recall) grinder's hopper fell apart for the second time. Like the Starbucks grinder, this generates static electricity but if you ground yourself (say, to the sink) for a minute or so, it's not so bad. Static electricity is to be expected, so I didn't rate it any less for that. We've had this grinder close to 1 year now and it's worked flawlessly in that time. The stainless steel housing looks great with our other stainless steel appliances (until ss goes out of favour!). I was impressed that one could buy replacement parts for most of the grinder at VERY reasonable prices, unlikely our Starbucks."
4,Best grinder I've owned.,"Grinds very well, VERY quiet compared to the Braun I replaced. Only problem is the amount of static electricity it generates grinding. Static causes grounds to stick to the plastic and coffee ends up everywhere. If not for this I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Excellent performance,"I have used a variety of bean grinders in the under $100 range and this one is the best. Why? Large grinding burrs that can be replaced for very a modest cost when they become dull. Produces an even consistent grind without much coffee dust. Not excessively noisy and easy to clean. The one shortcoming is the lack of a mechanism to keep the hopper fixed in position. If it moves forward, the grounds end up behind the hopper creating a small mess to fiddle with. My last grinder from C..., looked great with the stainless steel trim, but it sounded like a jet engine winding up and produced considerable coffee dust and then switch failed. Also, a much smaller grinding burr that ran at a very high, noisy speed. This unit is best value for overall function in grinding beans even though it may not look like kitchen ""bling"". Wish I would have spent the extra for the metal housing unit."
4,Good choice for my uses.,"Works as described. Fits my needs. Will comment again about reliability, etc. when have used for longer time. Good price."
2,I really wanted to like this grinder.,I have been using burr grinders for awhile with great success. This was my first conical burr grinder. I can say that I have been duly disappointed. There is a tremendous amount of static electricity and therefore ground coffee that builds up on the receptacle container as well as running up the outside of the grinder itself (messy). I was able to reduce the static problem significantly with a Bounce non-scented fabric softener sheet. There is no on/off switch. If you start grinding and run out of beans you just have to let it run until it cycles through the number you set on the dial. The numbers on the dial also seems not to correspond well to cups of coffee. I enjoyed the Cuisinart Burr grinder much more at about 1/3 the price. The Cuisinart to my taste also results in a better cup of coffee.
5,Home roaster,This burr grinder does it all.I started out with course and I'm at the fine grind right now. It seems to through my coffee pot better.
4,Great grinder,Hands down this makes the best coffee grinds for a coffee press. My mother has a blade grinder and when I make coffee at my parents house I can taste a difference in coffee quality. Would buy another!
1,"Do not buy this grinder- cheap build quality, poor design","DO NOT BUY THIS GRINDER!!!I have had nothing but problems with this grinder. I bought one of these grinder before Christmas and had to return it because the coffee bean hopper refused to seat properly into the grinder. Amazon shipped me another one and I ran into the same exact problem. I followed all of the instructions provided with the grinder and tried to install the hopper as it should be installed but it refused to go in. In case you were wondering, instead of a dial being used to control the fineness of the grind, the hopper is used to do this. I find this design to be extremely poor and part of the problem with the grinder. Also, the build quality is extremely cheap and the parts feel very flimsy. There are much better grinders available for the price so do not buy this one."
2,"Worked well for a year, then busted","This grinder worked very well, for the year or so it worked. The only complaint I would have is the static electricity imparted to the coffee, the device, or both, which made the process alittle messy. That may simply be an affliction that all such devices have. All this said, it seems to me that the clear plastic canister on the top, and particularly the integrated tabs that fit into the grinder itself, were flimsy. That is how the machine got busted. Past its warranty. Given that the other reviewers, many of them, describe this as one of the hardiest of the grinders in its class, I am not sure about what to buy as a replacement,"
1,Bad support and terrible product-Way over priced.,"The grinder is to big, to ugly, and it makes to much noice. It shreds the beans instead of grinding them. Customer service is the worst as they run out of spare parts and never follow up with promised calls. There are better and cheaper grinders you can buy. Stay away."
1,Not worth the high price,"Lets see my $18 grinder lasted 3 years. My $90 Capresso 560 lasted... 3 years, what's the verdict? Save your money. This is a badly designed over priced boutique grinder that doesn't do any better at grinding than a cheap one, and certainly didn't last any longer. The cup that catches the grinds constantly moves from the vibration of the motor till it is about 1/4 inch out and a lot of grinds fall in back, requiring you to unplug the unit and move it over a trash can to dump out all the extra grinds that don't fall into the container... BAD design!!!BTW-The Capresso wants $60 to replace my broken one... NO WAY!"
1,Terrible Design,"Do not buy this grinder if you want to grind different types of coffee. There is so much ground coffee left in the chamber each time that in order to separate types of coffee, you have to clean it out every time you use it. It is especially bad if you want coffee ground for espresso.The only good thing about the design is the container for the ground coffee. The angled side does make it easy to transfer to the coffee maker"
5,Great first Burr Grinder!!!,"I did a lot of looking before I bought this Capresso 560. It has not disappointed. I LOVE the consistent grind coarseness and find the range is perfect as I can easily adjust it to acceptable thickness for drip, or french press, or vacuum coffee production. I don't do expresso so I'm not sure about suitability for that. I have no problems with the collection bin (as others reported). I've been using it a month and give it top ratings. (PS: I went for the Black Plastic version as it is a outstanding value and grinds equally well as the optional metal housing version)"
4,"So far, so good!","The quality of our morning coffee has taken a huge step up with this grinder. Compared with our old blade grinder, the grind is uniform, the taste is vastly improved, and fewer beans are needed per cup. So far, the grinder is working as it should, and will hopefully last a long time. The only negative is that some grinds usually wind up on the counter top. I would consider this a great value, assuming good longevity."
2,Attractive but flawed...,"I purchased the Capresso Infinity 560 coffee grinder via Amazon and all aspects of the purchase were outstanding. No wonder Amazon is the world's best flea market. Had I written this review during the first fews days of ownership, I probably would have given the attractive little Capresso four stars. My first grinds were a French Roast and I selected the middle grind position and the result was satisfactorily. Subsequent grinds were not so great. Positioning the grind selector does not change how coarse or fine the resulting grind is. The bean basket engages the grind selector ring but the difference between Extra Fine and Coarse is minute. All grinds appear to be Fine. This is a fatal flaw. I can live with static and the resulting mess as noted by other reviewers but if I am grinding coffee, I want to taylor the grind to the bean properties."
1,Terrible service,"I had one of these, and while it had some drawbacks, it did OK for a couple of years until the plastic timer knob broke. I called the company to try and get a replacement knob, and after playing phone tag across several days, I finally got an answer: they don't offer replacement knobs. My only option was to buy a complete reconditioned grinder. I needed a part that probably costs less than a dollar, yet their only option was to sell me a reconditioned grinder. This is completely unacceptable for a product in this price range. I ended up using pliers to turn the shaft, but I eventually broke the timer with this method.The product may be OK, but the service is terrible. I don't recommend supporting the Capresso company."
5,Easy to clean!,"I bought this grinder as a present for my husband. It's heavy duty and non-moving on the counter, easy to take apart for cleaning and quiet! It does a fantastic job of even grinding at all of the grind settings we typically use. The coffee has never tasted better!"
2,Pain to clean - shoots grounds everywhere,"Agree with alot of others here - this product is a pain. You will battle waves of rogue, ballistic coffee grounds as you lift the grounds container out of the machine (ok, little exaggeration, but I just got through cleaning it for the 3rd time this week). I've tried to solve it by placing foil under the machine, holding the container in place as it grinds,.. but its a losing battle. Wish I had purchased something else."
4,"Works nicely for coarser grinds, static is a slight problem","Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder, BlackAfter reading many reviews here and elsewhere I find I agree with most;1. This grinder works well.2. Isn't terribly loud.3. Hopper is plastic and would be a bit more durable feeling if it were thicker, or if it were glass.4. Bin for catching ground beans definitely suffers from static - changing it from plastic would be a big help. I don't do fine grinding, but the small amount of fines that come through definitely dance around as I pull the bin out, and scoop from it. Sometimes literally jumping out of the bin if I drag the scoop up the side. Funny to watch, but a small pain to clean up.A good grinder that suffers from a static problem. 4 out of 5 for not making a change that has apparently been long requested."
4,"Works well, could use a preset for the timer","The Capresso 565 does a great job for the money, however, it could use a preset for the timer. Had an old Salton before-It did an OK job, was noisey AND messy, but had a preset so you could simply press a button and get the same amount of gound coffee every time without having to use a measure"
2,Designed to fail after a few months,"This did a really nice job of grinding coffee, for about three months. Now all it does is make noise. I opened it up to see what was wrong and found that the grinding mechanism is held together by three, paper thin, plastic locking tabs. All of the pressure of two grinding surfaces is held by these tabs. Once any of these tabs bend out just a tiny bit the grinding pressure forces them open and they all break.This is my first burr grinder so I can't comment on how it compares to others in this price range, but I can say that I'll never buy anything made by Capresso again."
4,"Great quality, small footprint, not very coarse for french press.","Heavy, smaller than it looks, easy to clean. Good static control in the grounds hopper. For all the grind settings, some may wish it had a few coarser settings for french press. It does work for my press, though. Otherwise a great choice."
3,Good Coffee - Bad Dust,"This grinder is easy to use and makes excellent coffee. Unfortunately, you need to wear a hazmat suit to survive the dust. No matter how careful you are, you always always get a mess. Previously I had a Bodum grinder and it created much less mess but the coffee wasn't as good. Keep a portable vacuum nearby and enjoy your java."
2,pain to clean but works well,"Good: Performs well, very even grind.Bad: It comes with a little brush to clean around the grinding burrs. Grounds end up every where since you get to try to push the grounds through a little hole and into the container and then turn it upside down and brush the rest into a trash can. I can't get it completely clean - too many little grooves that accumulate grounds."
2,"It grinds, but not already grounded coffee","I can grind coffee beans to fine result. However, when I tried to grind some coarsely grounded coffee finer, it actually locked up and not even able to clean it by taking it apart. Whole core pieces are stuck together. Motor smoke and not longer turnning. This is disappointing. A burr grinder should be able to grin any coffee, bean or not bean.I have to send this one back, since it is useless now."
3,It's ok,If you want a cheap burr grinder then choose this one. I would suggest you save you money and purchase a higher quality burr grinder.
5,Great begginers grinder...,This is by far the best cheap grinder you can get... Very easy to clean and I hope It last me a good couple of years...
5,Great value!,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. We're both coffee snobs and we both love it. Yes, I use it as much as she does and I am considering buying my own. It does exactly what it is supposed to do-- grind coffee beans. The motor grinds through a hopper full with seemingly little effort and the grinds are uniform in texture. You twist the hopper to adjust the texture settings. We've ground medium for automatic drip makers and coarse for a french press. The results were perfect.Jumping coffee grinds from static electricity is still a problem with this grinder. Nevertheless, it is still a quality grinder for the money. I'd buy the same model if I could do it all over again."
3,Good but messy,I like the smooth operation but really dislike the mess of trying to get the bowl out without spilling grounds everywhere. The collection bowl is badly designed...you will have to live with that...otherwise it is quiet and effecient.
5,No complaints,"I've been using this grinder for about a month now. It wasn't hard to learn what setting to use to get just the fineness I want, and it looks nice on my counter. I still haven't learned exactly how long to set the timer or how many beans I need each day, but that's not a big problem, and I assume that will come. I accidentally removed the plastic bean container once, letting all the beans fall all over the place, but that was my own fault for not thoroughly memorizing the instructions or realizing that this grinder works differently from my previous one. A minor flaw: the little plastic collar indicating the ""up"" side of the burr can easily come off inadvertently."
5,best burr grinder,"After more than 20 years of service our old burr grinder became difficult to use. That model is no longer available. I researched to try to find one that would be like the old one. This Capresso 565 burr grinder has turned out to be beyond my expectations. Very well made, easy to operate, relatively quiet and does an excellent job. The timer makes it easy to grind just the right amount for your brew. I have only used it for press coffee so far and rate it excellent. Service and shipping from Amazon was perfect. I really didn't think I would find a grinder this good. In use one month."
3,"Messy, messy, messy","I recently purchased this grinder to replace our old Cuisinart one which stopped working. I like the fact that it runs more quietly than our old one, but when you try to remove the container of grounds, they fly everywhere. I have to clean my kitchen counter( and sometimes the floor) every time we grind coffee. This is a very poor feature and I think they need to place a cover on the grounds container to decrease the mess! I have returned this item and will not purchase another one from this company until they improve the ""mess factor!"""
3,works ok but very noisy,I have no regrets buying this one. But when it burns out I will not buy another one like it. I want to get a quieter ones. It ishard to know which is quiet and which is noisy but in a store sometimes you can try it out. Not worth returning. The coffee is very good and it is very easy to control the grind size which is the important part. I just have to remember to grind the night before so that I don't wake up other people in the house if I get up early and want some coffee....
1,This product is almost impossible to assemble,"Product needed the alignment of an interior part. We could not decipher how to do it. The written instructions were confusing at best. We called and although the man who answered the phone was knowledgebile and courteous we both became frustrated. We returned this product, went to Bloomingdales and paid a bit more and got the same product that worked wiyhout us needed to fuss with it"
1,Does not work as advertised on Fine Grind or any Grind,"Oh my gosh. I had read so many reviews and considered getting this grinder a big splurge. I sure was disappointed. Stopped working on the first fine setting grind in the middle of the grind. Stuck beans I guess. I had to empty it out clean it and start again. 4 different days later, I switched back to my old grinder. Every day was a challenge and I don't think it really do a good job on what it did grind. My coffee came out weak. I love my Krups Burr Grinder and will continue with it. I thought I might be stepping up on a good cup of coffee, but I sure was wrong. This is the most finicky Burr Grinder ever! Not worth the effort. I returned this item. Does not work as advertised."
4,Great purchase,"I love this coffee grinder. I haven't had any issues with it lately except for once, when the grinder was inserted incorrectly. It was frustrating getting it out, but that's user error. I highly recommend this product."
2,"Great grinder, poor service","This is the best grinder for grinding coffee that I have ever had. However, the turn knob, a small plastic part, broke at the stem. I am not a rough user, so I am not sure of the part's quality. I called Capresso for a new part and was told that their policy was never to ship parts but if I sent the grinder in, they would repair it for $85 plus shipping costs. Way too much for a grinder I paid $89 for. A poor company policy designed to sell more product but not to serve the customer."
4,Works well...but,"Purchased two of these grinders, and am pleased with the resulting grounds. BUT...expect to clean up the dusting of grounds around the grinder. Gently tapping/rocking the grinder before removing the bin helps, but does not eliminate the debris. Would I purchase again? Yes."
4,"Good grinder, dependable.","It's a dependable grinder that produces excellent ground coffee. The only thing I do not like is the on/off timer dial. Instead of a timing dial, they should have installed a good, old-fashioned ON/OFF switch."
4,Almost Burr-fect!,"This is an excellent, reasonably-priced burr grinder. Particles are uniform and consistent. If there is any fault, it is the design of the curved front of the finished grind container. Static makes the coffee cling to the plastic and if you lift and tilt the container to fill your portafilter, small clumps are very likely to spill out away from the intended spot. I grind a little extra and dip the coffee out with a spoon to avoid the mess and the waste."
4,Effective and quiet,"My last burr grinder (Cuisinart) lasted 6 months. I wasn't sorry to see it die - it was unbelievably loud, very hard to seat the plastic container that held the ground coffee, and the grind was inconsistent.This grinder was better from the moment I opened the box. It has a small profile and is dead simple to set up. I was almost sold when I actually turned it on - hard to believe how much quieter it is - and was completely sold when I looked at the ground coffee. Absolutely perfectly ground, every time.I highly recommend this grinder. The only reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is that I haven't had it long enough to know how it will hold up."
5,Research and Decided on This One,"I did my homework This is a nice piece without having to spend 200.00 or more. Build quality is real good, it's basically quiet, and grinds the beans with consistency.Let's hope she lasts. My last was the 40.00 Cuisinart and I fried it.Seriously, we are complaining about static electricity? Give me a break. Easy to remedy."
3,"don't believe the lies about static cling, it's bad","This a great grinder for the price, as far as the grinding itself goes, but the ""popping"" caused by static cling is terrible. Makes an awful mess. As soon as I can afford a metal and glass grinder, I'm replacing this thing."
5,Best Burr Grinder Available,"I went through sever grinders before I found this little marvel. It's very quiet for a grinder, no unintentional wake-up factor for others in the house and is actually able to grind fine enough for a great espresso. Trust the pamphlet when it says that ""extra fine"" is meant for Turkish coffee and not needed for a 15 bar pump machine. I use the 3rd highest on the ""fine"" setting for my Classico machine. Great results and a great product. Buy it!"
2,way too much plastic,Took it out of the box and immediately decided there was no love here...WAY too much plastic. Shipped it back immediately; never used it so I can't comment on function. Just does not feel like something I would expect to be around long. I'm tired of importing disposable junk from Asia--decided to import heavier stuff from Europe instead [Rocky feels like an heirloom in comparison].
1,Don't Buy,I'm too disgusted to leave an appropriate review. Save yourself from a poorly designed product and buy another grinder (any grinder but this one). The blades locked up before I ever had a chance to make one cup of coffee!
4,It really is worth the price difference,"I bought this refurbished after my old blade grinder died and a much cheaper burr grinder turned out to be a bad choice.I use a french press to make regular coffee every morning, so I do not use the finer settings and can't speak to this grinder's suitability for that task. However, it does make a nice even medium coarse grind for my bodum. The hopper closes tightly and keeps the coffee in it fresh. And the grinder does not seem to heat up the beans at all. It's very easy to take apart and clean, which keeps the coffee tasting good. And it doesn't have a huge footprint. I paid about twice what it would have cost to replace my blade grinder and a little more than twice what I paid for the Black and Decker burr grinder I tried first.The price differential is well worth it to me just for the grind consistency alone, but I also appreciate the timer feature and how easy this is to clean. I'm very happy with the purchase."
3,Good Grinder; Parts Can Assemble Incorrectly,"I have owned this mill for over a year and have been happy with it. Much easier to use than the small ones that require constant brushing to remove the ground coffee during each use. However, despite the fact that I have disassembled and reassembled this thing many times, last night I managed to put a key piece (the burr piece) in upside down. Do they warn you about this in the manual? I don't recall. In the course of attempting to use it this morning, and then fix it, I managed to completely wedge that piece in and can't get it out. The entire thing is going into the trash. You don't just have to be careful of aligning the top plastic part correctly! So much for European design."
2,It's Just Too Fragile,"I bought this coffee grinder based mostly on customer reviews. I guess I should have paid more attention to the one-star reviews! After I had used the grinder only two times, the upper burr locked into place and there was no way to get it unstuck. One reviewer had the same problem and was able to fix it by inserting a butter knife into a slot. Tried it, didn't work. I decided that if this grinder is so prone to malfunction, the best thing to do would be, alas, to return it. For the two times that it did work, the grind was great and I was really enjoying my fresh-ground coffee!"
3,Not Consistent,"For 1 cup of beans, the result is uneven. I'm disappointed.Static issue as many people pointed out, however, I don't experience that."
3,"Better than blade grinder, but not up to par","I bought this to replace a blade grinder. I make coffee by french press (requiring a uniformly coarse grind) and espresso machine (requiring a uniformly fine grind) so the size of the grind is very important to me.Grinding for espresso was not a problem. Turned out great.Grinding for french press, however, was quite problematic. The grinder produced lots of ultrafine particles (basically coffee dust) along with the coarse grind I wanted that led to gross overextraction of the coffee. Basically it made my french pressed coffee taste terrible unless I carefully blew the dust from the grinds before proceeding.I was attracted to the price and the favorable reviews, but I'm not totally satisfied."
3,coffee lover,"I have always wanted to have an expensive, excellent grinder. This is a good one, but it's VERY messy to use and clean and takes so long to use it because of the cleaning. I am disappointed."
2,Big Disappointment,"The grounds are good, but the plastic bin that they drop into sprays fine grounds all over the palce when you pull it out, even very gently, due to static electricity (noted in another review). We find if we wait a few minutes after each round of grinding, the spray of grounds is somewhat less dramatic, but still very messy. Fundamental design flaw, Capresso.Frankly, we dread grinding coffee beans due to the mess it makes. We wind up spreading out newspaper under the unit to catch all the tiny grounds that spray out.I contacted Capresso about this via their website. Their customer support had no sugegstions or remedy, no static-resistant replacement cup, basically they were unhelpful and surprisingly unsympathetic. ""All grinders have that problem"" was their attitude.It's a shame, because we are devoted to our MT-500 coffee maker, which makes outstanding coffee. But this burr grinder is a big disappointment. I do not expect we will buy another Capresso grinder anytime soon."
4,Very good Grinder for Price -- A Couple Small Issues,"I'll keep it short. Grinds really well, especially for the price. Seems well made. Two issues are:1. When you clean, there is this notch along the perimeter inside that is impossible to clean even with a brush. If old grounds affect flavor (and I believe that they can), I worry that I can't really clean those old grounds 100%, although it is a very narrow notch, in fairness.2. As observed below, switching beans is a problem if you really use the hopper for storage. I just spoon in what I want to ground that day instead. Supposedly it is not good to let your beans be in a clear container anyway, but then again some people simply don't have a life. I'm sure it's fine to have a little light for a few days if you're not fanatic! :-)The bottom line, however, is that the overall machine seems very well made and grinds are uniform done properly for very reasonable cost."
4,Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder,Grinds very well and less noise than previous burr grinder.I had a smalllearning curve with the timing dial as it starts the second it is turnedso difficult to judge the same setting at first. I would like a start switch after selecting the setting. Still a small amount of static coffeeflies around but not a big deal. Better than old Cuisinart. Overall verypleased.
2,Good product but stopped worked,It is a great product but it stopped working after 8 months of use. They don't have any support centers in canada that i can call them for warranty.
5,Quiet grinder,"This grinder is quiet, I was tired of being awakened by my wife grinding coffee. Another nice quality is you can grind just the amount of coffee you need for your particular serving."
2,Too much static charge,"I've had the Capresso 560 for a few months now, and while it is holding up well, and grinds coffee nicely, it has a design flaw in that it creates a large amount of static charge in the ground coffee, so that if you immediately remove the ground coffee, some of it flies into the air and sticks to any nearby surface, such as your hand, your coffee cup, and the coffeemaker. This is a lot more annoying than you might think. As another reviewer mentioned, you have to grind the coffee in advance and let it sit for 30 min or more so that the static charge dissipates. I had a previous coffee grinder that did not do this, so it is specific to this model. Even though it grinds nicely, I'm shopping for a different brand."
4,Great grinder,"I absolutely love this grinder, coffee has never tasted so good, from French press to drip the difference is amazing, not quite fine enough for esspresso though. Only complaint is coffee resides in the grinder so if you switch from fine to coarse you get a little find grind at first."
2,doesn't grind very well,"we got this to grind turkish style coffee. it's very slow, constantly blocks up even with very little amount of beans, and allows unground chunks of bean to fall through.yick. switched back to our 30 year old bladed grinder held together by duct tape and a prayer."
1,"Great, When it Worked...","We loved this grinder for the VERY short time it functioned! We make coffee every morning and it worked well for 7 days and then it didn't work at all. The Capresso company had us ship it back to them for a replacement. Hopefully the second one will work longer than the first, but in the meantime we're back to using an old Krups grinder we were given as a wedding gift 26 years ago. I'm hoping I can update this review with a positive outcome regarding this grinder! I plan on buying another grinder for our vacation home. It won't be a Capresso."
4,"Works great, but creates a mess.","I've had this grinder for two years. Works great, but it is impossible not to end up with coffee grounds all over my kitchen countertop. I have resorted to placing it on a kitchen towel to catch all the coffee grounds. Instructions say to clean it after each use - really????"
1,"Broke after 6 months, no replacement part",The title pretty much says it all. One day I turned the knob and it broke. No replacement dial available. Oh how I love plastic crap. Nothing is made well anymore.....
4,"The best coffee grinder I've ever used...quiet, efficient and attractive.",I researched a lot of coffee grinders and found this to have excellent reviews. I use this in my home several times a day and it works perfectly. I bought it used but it seems to work perfectly and does a wonderful job of grinding at various levels of courseness and even grinds the exact amount for the number of cups desired. I accented my countertop perfectly to go along with the other stainless appliances. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Capresso Coffee Mill,"Expect to do a little cleanup after grinding i.e. it grinds very well but leaves lots of little coffee bits around the area, especially if you overload the storage drawer. It's a good solid machine with plenty of fineness adjustments. The instructions give you an idea re/ how fine to grind for various types of coffee and coffee makers, very helpful. We actually thought our brewed coffee tasted a little richer when ground w/ a burr grinder Vs the old blade mill we used for years. If you're a coffee lover, this might make you like it more. Try different fineness settings and you'll be surprised what a difference it can make.Pros: solid machine, great adjustments for fineness, easy to use, good instructions/advice.Cons: somewhat messy until you learn not to grind too much coffee at one time."
1,Broke in Two Weeks,"We bought this for work. It was OK while it lasted, but broke within a couple weeks. Pretty cheap construction."
2,No coarse grined!,"I received this grinder as a gift I thought I would use and enjoy. I'm not happy so started looking for a different grinder. Came across this model that I have and was surprised at the cost.One big problem: The manual says 17 settings for grind. It is 17 different settings of ""fine"". From really, really fine powder to much too fine for a drip coffee maker. And press coffee turns to mud. Maybe I am doing something wrong. If anyone knows, please tell me."
5,My second Capresso,"After retiring my first Capresso burr grinder after five great years of service I wanted to stay with this brand. I have not been disappointed. The 560 Infinity is easy to use and definitely quieter than my previous model. The grind selection mode is an easy twist of the coffee bean container and the turn-on dial is simple and versatile to your desired quantity of ground coffee. I can live with the static in the depository cup, it really is not that bad. Ultimately, this great little device brings me great pleasure with every cup of french roast that I brew. I was tempted to switch brands - but Capresso has been very, very good to me."
5,critical,Maria Schneider is great. I saw Maria Schneider Orchestra live at TheBirdland in NYC. They are fantastic.
5,Perfect Match for Ariens Orange,"great for scratched up yard and snow equipment as it's perfect match for Ariens' Orange. Good stuff, always have some on hand."
3,Chili Con Mango,"This product was ok. I wanted another brand and was recommended on this one. It good, but not bad. I probably wont order again."
2,Zero mango or chilli taste. Pure sugar.,"I got this because it was the only ""chilli mango"" with free shipping. A mistake. Sugar isoverwhelming, hiding the mango taste. Chilli and lime are barely and distantly detectable. If you are looking for an expensive generic sweet, this might make you happy. If you are looking for the exotic, multi-layered taste of mango and chilli, look elsewhere."
2,Meh,"Too dry inside. Felt like it was really old stock or something. I know it's supposed to be dried fruit, but I've had nearly identical products that tasted much better and were slightly moist inside (probably some special process). Anyway, it's a food item - just a matter of taste. Nothing particularly horrible about it, I just didn't like it. YMMV"
2,Does Not Moisturize - But Smells Great,My daughter and I are both of African descent with hair prone to dryness and brittleness. My hair is relaxed but my daughter's isn't. It appears to dry her hair more especially when used after a shampoo. Smells great but does not add moisture. Truly disappointed.
3,Learned something but not specific.,This is for the beginners. I feel I learned something from the book but the ideas are too general. Besides there are not many specific examples of start-ups.
5,this blade rocks,"this blade is the baest , it beat my dragoon gt,my draciel g,my dranzer gt and my metal driger.you should really buy it"
4,Killer Funk/Rock/Fusion Performance!!,"This is a really cool DVD! Excellent tunes and killer performances by the band. If you're into instrumental funk/rock/fusion, you should definitely check this out! Don't expect a lighting show & a 5-camera shoot (that's why it's a bootleg), but it's all about 3 excellent musicians stretching out on some wild instrumentals. For fans of the Steve Morse Band, Gambale/Hamm/Smith, etc. I'm not saying they sound just like them, but I get the same kind of vibe. The ONLY reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it was longer...Peace,Tom"
2,"Stretching the terms ""Great"" and ""Hit""","Herbie Hancock has never lacked the guts to try different things, for which I admire him greatly. However, the results tend to be quite sketchy. This album is obviously an attempt to sell Herb's career as a funk/pop artist, which was sketchy to say the least. The excellent song ""Chameleon"" is here - well, the first half, anyway. A remix of ""Doin' It"" is pleasant enough, but ""I Thought It Was You"" was pretty bad when it was three minutes long...here it's eight. ""Hang Up Your Hang Ups"" is funky and fun, but not enough to salvage the album as a whole. For completists or very very casual fans only."
2,Not a good compilation,"Greatest Hits lacks a most of the best compositions of Herbie Hancock. It features songs from his worst albums (specially from Feet don't fail me) Still, Chameleon, from ""Headhunters"" is here, but it's better to stay with the original version from the album. The album doesn't show the talent and diversity of Hancock's catalogue. Instead, you can try buying Headhunters of Quartet, wich sound more serious."
3,Still good but incomplete,"I'ma agree w/ the rest of the reviewers on this 'cuz Herbie never runs out-of-style while doin' best-of or greatest hits compilations. Specially anthologies also. I was a lil furious when I heard this by once checking it at a local library near Fulton County and was thinking bout having this just whether they'll add 'mo tracks and/or definitely remaster or re-issued I'll say. Most songs that are bangin are: Doin' It, I Thought It Was You (cool vibe, cool singing and luv the horn parts too and hot work from the rhythm section), Chameleon, and Hang Up your Hang Ups (same as above on ""I Thought It Was You"", I'll actually say this is jammin right here w/ nice horns, live rhythm section, beautiful sax work from Bennie Maupin and great melody on the ARP String Ensemble played by Herbie himself). 'Nuff said. Check out more if u can or just say it's a no-brainer or it needs more work or enuff tracks. They pushed too hard sumtimes."
3,Pretty Good But Empty,Herbie Hancock is a Great Talent but this Compilation is Half-Hearted to say the least.to really appreciate the Funkier Side of Herbie Buy Headhunters or some of his 70's Albums.Chameleon alone is worth the price.but it's hit&Miss the rest of the way.
2,Really just for decoration,"These are very cute bookends, but they are not sturdy at all. They cannot hold many books. Just a few children's books cause them to slide. I ended up buying another set to actually hold the books in my son's nursery and have these in his playroom for decoration."
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered this for my 7 yr old grandaughter for Valentines Day. Upon receipt it was not operable. The user is supposed to ask the ""Love Ball"" a question, and then turn it over to see the answer under a clear glass window. The answer would not appear under window it seemed to be covered with a dark liquid."
1,Maybe it wasn't love?,"This love ball was very un-lovely. The messages would not appear clearly in the window, no matter how I tried turning it over different ways.Maybe it sat too long in the wrong environment before I received it. I put it back in the box and plan to ship it back."
1,psycho love ball,this thing almost never works unless you keep shaking it as the answer is revealed-don't think that's the way it should work- just a cheap version of the old favorite magic 8 ball really badly manufactured.
3,fun,I bought this for one of my girlfriends who is single and goes to the psychic every 6 months. She thought it was cute and I told her to save the money she keeps giving the psychic and just consult the magic ball :)
5,TOO MUCH FUN !!!,THESE TOY WAS ACTUALLY GIVEN TO A DEAR FRIEND AS A COMICAL GIFT. ITS CUTE TO SEE A GROUP OF WOMEN SITTING AROUND HAVING A COCKTAIL SHAKING THIS PHYSIC LOVE BALL ASKING THE MOST RIDICULUS QUESTIONS ! IT'S A HOOT !!! DEFINATLY A CUTE CONVERSATION PIECE :)
2,Lackluster Love Ball,"Thought this would provide fun for my 12-year-old and her crew for Valentine's Day, but the product arrived three days after the holiday (10 days to ship even though it was in stock) and when you shake it and turn it over to see the answer, you can barely see the words. Sounds like something inside is broken, but I'm not going to bother returning it at this point. It was the thought that counted. Cute idea, but execution for me was lackluster."
1,cancelled shipment,"After ordering the product, two days later I recieved an email cancelling the order. I have yet to see the return on my credit card. I will not be ordering from this company again."
4,nice wallet,"Very pretty and good leather wallet. Has bunch of slots for credit cards and I love it. Very hard to find anything like this. All CC slots attached to the wallet, so nothing will fall out. There is pouch for coins too.The only thing is that CC slots are just cut through the leather and it doesn't look like it will survive for a long time use (that is why 4 stars). Otherwise - great wallet."
2,Good buy for the $,Good quality wallet.However it stated it was a black wallet and I received a brown one. I was disappointed.
2,Inaccurate & Falsely advertised,"The description above and on the back specifically state that the tactics of Fighter Weapons School (Top Gun) are discussed. While this is partially true, the description and the cover make this highly misleading. What is discussed is the history of fighter aces and the tactics they used in battles from WW1 to Vietnam. However, FWS was only developed towards the tail end of Vietnam. While it's obvious that the tactics the aces discuss led to the development of the systematized bag of tricks that ended up being packaged for FWS, again, the description and cover makes it seem as though 4th gen fighter jets and their applications would be explored. What they describe as graduates is actually totally inaccurate; they follow the precursors to what would later be graduates. Nothing > mach-speed is explored (and specifically, the fastest jet explored here was the A4 which is barely capable of mach 1). So, interesting, but ultimately a letdown."
2,DISAPPOINTED - Not 500 sheets!,"Don't be fooled. As I was told by amazon, the price is not for 500 sheets of paper. Rather, it is the price for 250 sheets of paper. I had a nightmare of an experience convincing amazon to correct their mistake. They made right be my order; however, they did not correct the item description. The paper itself is very nice and vibrant."
2,You can't judge a book by it's cover,"On the back of the book, there is a short synopsis of what this book is about. It waxes on about Marquis de Sade and his life. It mentions in two sentences about Sade's ""journey leads him back to America, to a seemingly normal suburban house. But the family who lives there is far from normal."" Guess what, 75% of the book is about this American family of vampires. What a collection of co-dependant, undead creatures !! The Sade character just peeks in and out of the story and we are left with the family of vampires who just can't get it together. I eventually got tired of the tedious storyline. I was dissapointed that the description wasn't really what the story was about. Other reviewers mentioned the short chapters were a nuisance. I agree."
5,ONE OF MITCHELL'S BEST- IF NOT T.H.E. BEST!!!,"I love 'Tainted Blood' by Mary Ann Mitchell! It's has a good stoy, & a great ending! I think the only partial downside in the book is the French that Sade adds in now & then b/c he doesn't remember how to say it in English... *bah!* All-in-All the story has all the good elements - Vampires, Blood, Comedy, Action & Sex. All that get combined in yet another blood~sucking Sade lifestyle & keeps the pages turning until you reach the end - & still leave you thirsty for more!"
5,hot hot hot!!!!,This is the BEST and the SEXIEST love book ever- just thinking of the Hot Bed Spell or the Hot Fudge Sundae Spell makes me....hot!And it WORKS!!!! Really!!!Get it and DO IT! yow!Dr. Dada
2,Its kind of cheap...,Overall there is nothing really wrong with the bag. It has plenty of space and it has excellent pockets. But I was disappointed in the quality of the product for $30. The zippers are cheap and the material is cheap.I went to target and got an Adidas duffel bag for $22.99 that was much nicer and the same size.
3,ok,"only good about this book is ""thomas the tank engine"" my sons love thomas. as for content, it's ok."
3,Torn pages.,"I think my nephew will like it, but I'm ashamed to give it to him. It was supposed to be a nice little extra for Christmas, but 2-3 of the lift tabs were torn really bad(about a 3"" long tear). When I buy used, I have always bought ""Like New"" (and been pleased). Maybe I lost my mind and bought ""Very Good"". Either way, it was quite the disappointment."
5,It isn't possible to have too many Thomas the Train books,This Thomas the Train book is similar but different from another Thomas the Train book I also bought. This book has little tabs to be opened throughout the book. I thought he might tear off the tabs but he hasn't. It was a great book choice. I guess for a 2 year old it isn't possible to have too much Thomas the Train books.
5,Perfect baby book,This is a perfect book for children between 1 and 2 years. They can listen to the story and participate by lifting the flaps and hearing the story behind them. Its an older book so the shipping cost more than the book but its worth it.
5,the good cook,This is a very good book for information on subjects to makeyou understand better what they are and how they are made.I was amazed at the things that I did not know about foodsand the preparing of them. This book would interest anyonejust beginning to cook or have many years of experience.
2,Good for glueing your fingers,I'm always having little projects come up that requires glue.I bought this product because of the name and advertising.I have tried using it on 3 or 4 different projects but have finally come to the conclusion that the only thing its good for is glueing your fingers together.You end up with glue all over your fingers because the items your glueing never seem to stay together so it gets rather messy as you try to get it to stick.I just dont like the product so I guess its back to gorilla glue.
1,hotel room issues,"I ordered this product in order to use it to glue all of the furniture in my hotel room to the ceiling. After glueing the nightstand and the cofee table to the ceiling, my friend passed out from the fumes and had to be rushed to the ER. After we finished glueng the bed, entertainment stand, and tv to the ceiling without him we went to bed. In the middle of the night the ceiling collapsed from the weight and crushed and killed my wife, I didn't like her anyway but the family in the room above us sued me for breaking their bones. Do not get this product unless you want to hurt people!"
1,Useless if you want instant bond,"I need something that will glue 2 pieces, instantly together, and though this claims it does it, it does not. Several minutes after I applied the glue it is still liquid enough that I can wipe it off with my finger! How is that the same as instant?I have a litte statue that broke at the neck, and the head is quite top heavy, which is why I need it to bond immediatly. Even after holding the head in place for a minute it still comes off as if I had no applied any of the glue.Does anyone remember the Krazy Glue from the '70s? This isn't it, but that is what I am looking for!"
5,Good 'ol Superglue saved me again,"It's nice to know that some things never change. And for this product, that is a very good thing! I recently had to re-attach a wing back onto a Christmas angelthe wife has had for years. I tried three other glues and epoxy - total waist of time. Found some Super-Glue I had in a desk drawer and it saved the day. My lovely wife is happy and that is a very good thing, too. Keep some around for emergencies.Great product, excellent value and highly recommended!"
4,A good source of music (37 songs) reproduced as first printed.,"I had been invited to provide music for an event relating to observance of the aniversary of certain Civil War events. I was not quite sure what I was looking for, but each of the three books brought its own advantage to me; I was very glad I had purchased all three. This was somewhat difficult to read musically, and less informaiton was provided about the backgrounds of the tunes. The reason I am glad I bought this is that all of the 37 songs are reproduced exactly as they were first printed, and therefore going through this book made me feel more connected to the time than did the other two books I bought seeking music and information from the time of the Civil War."
2,Too Hard to Play Honestly,"Challenging? No, Impossible is more like it! Just remember to download the cheat codes first before playing this game, you'll need them.The graphics, sound and user interface are exceptional but those features are over-shadowed by the short amount of time players stay alive in the game. This is not really a serious gaming experience, its more of an exercise in futility. The only time you'll last longer than an alka-seltzer tablet in a glass of water is when you play as the Predator and even then your life span is not that long. The alien can't heal and the marine is the ultimate victim. The game settings should not be ""Easy"", ""Medium"" and ""Hard""; they should be changed to ""Slow Suicide"", ""Quick Death"" and ""Don't Bother Fighting Back""."
4,"Yumm Yumm <crunch, munch>...","Yes, the AI is linear - but that's okay. Learn how to use the Alien special 'weapon' - the retractable mouth - and munch away on cowering tech's. Yep - at first it's a bit creepy, but after a bit, it gets to be fun.Not a game for youngsters - you really do have to enjoy getting 'wet' to enjoy.Not as simplistic as Unreal Tournament - too bad there is not a multiplayer feature."
5,BEST GAME EVER CREATED!,"AvP is the best game I have ever played, and I have played shoot'em down games since I was 6 years old. The graphics are terrific, and several scenes in the game are staight out of the movies. The marine has a wide array of unbeatable weapons, and in my opinion, the most fun to play. The Predator is very fun to play, because you can be invisible, and sneak up on marines. The alien is quite fun because you can climb around on walls. Each species is unique, and awesome. You must get this game. THERE IS ONLY ONE DOWNSIDE TO THIS GAME! There aren't enough levels. I finished all the levels, and was very depressed that the magic was over. But it did take a while to finish them all. This is an AWESOME GAME!"
5,MY REVIEW OF ALIENS VS PREDATOR,well i guess this game is really good and I think it was pretty good if you like killing things that apear from nowere
4,Look at the price,"It's not a must have game, but look at the price.If you even remotely like first-person shooters you should buy this game. It's great to see such diversity in the species. Each has very distinct advantages and disadvantages that make the game more enjoyable.Another great deal is multiplayer online. All first-person shooters are great online and add to the replay value of a game.It's a good game, but not perfect and the price makes it a must have."
4,old school awesome!,"PROS: AVPCONS: No more servers? I remember back in the day we had to use gamespy to play.. I havent seen any MP AVP servers lately, would be cool to kill some more peeps as an alien these days!!"
5,Very Very fun,"I didn't get my AVP Gold game here i had the original from 1999. You won't be disappointed this game is hard at first but once you get into it it is sooooooooo fun each level is challenging and you can play Skirmish, Multiplayer, or story mode, Alien, Predator, or Colonial marine (witch is the funnest i think). BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!!!! Also each thing you can play has 6 levels and 6 bonus levels. BUY IT NOW 5 +++. Overall i wood HIGHLY recommend it"
1,NOT AS PICTURED,"The ring I received from seller Gem Avenue looks like a cheap knock-off the beautiful ring in the picture. Had I received a ring looking similar to the picture I would have been satisfied. The ring I received has a metal rim around the garnet. The picture in the ad shows a ring with a prong setting, the ring I received has a cheap cracker box metal lip with a seam at the top and bottom holding the stone in place. Very disappointing after the great reviews I read."
4,Beautiful ring,Love the ring. Beautiful craftmanship. Larger stone than I expected but still a great ring.
5,Chock full of awesome,"It's as if They Might be Giants wrote lyrics, Moxy Fruvous filled in the harmonies and Firesign Theater popped in for some tea."
1,Misses the point of buying a CD,"Caveat emptor - See that CDR note at the top of the page? What you get is what they say you get, but don't expect to receive any liner notes, or even a track listing."
2,Doesn't keep food warm for long,"I was disappointed in this item. I purchased it to send my son to school with a ""hot"" lunch for a more nutritious option than a sandwich. He told me it was cold by lunch which is only 3 1/2 hours. I followed the directions and put hot water in the jar for 20 minutes before adding the hot food. I tried it again for myself and sure enough the food just doesn't stay warm. I purchased the Termos King to replace this and we'll see how that does."
2,"great, until the seal on the lid fails","I got 4 of these jars based on the reviews and a 4 for 3 Amazon deal, and they were perfect for about 5 months, until 2 of the 4 lids lost their ability to hold steam and heat."
2,Pretty good - loses too much heat from the top,"By lunch time, my soup is warm rather than hot. Next time I'll look for a container with a stainless steel top. The mouth is too narrow to comfortably eat soup with a normal spoon. I now pack an extra long spoon (like for ice tea).I wish I had bought something better, but it is okay and looks like it will last for many years."
5,most pleased,"this sure beats my old plastic thermos, much smaller and better looking. also, keeps food (soups & chilis) hot all day when preheat w/boiling water. saves me lots of money when I'm out through mealtime, just take my little thermos and a spoon and I can eat just about anywhere. love this thermos!"
1,Defective cold soup,Defective product used as directed food cold 3 times. Tryed to return after 30 days seller said no. paid for this higher priced product hoping for quality. Thumbs down on this one. Interesting that some reviews were good mine was defective.
2,Funky smell after a while.,"I've had this thermos for a few years now. I use it for taking soup to work for lunch. At this point, there is a funky, sour smell in the thermos that doesn't wash out. It now contaminates the food with a funky taste. It also leaks if you aren't very careful about how you put on the lid. It never did keep the soup piping hot, just warm. Overall, I'm disappointed with the way this product performed over time."
1,Does not keep warm,"BUYER BEWARE, I can't believe I am going to say this because I have been promoting the Thermos Nissan brand to my co workers but this one fails miserably. I own several different types of Themos products but unfortunately the 10 oz does not meet the Nissan Thermos standard. It does not keep hot water/food warm for more than 1 to 2 hours. I am very disappointed. The container is not double walled but is solid and does not leak therefore I will use it for other purpose other than what it was intended for."
4,"Stays hot, but leaches heat","This thermos keeps my hot food very hot for hours on end. My only caution is that the lid tends to get very warm, so when I put it in my lunch bag with cold foods, it warms those foods up prematurely. May want to get a separate bag to put this in when you're storing hot food in it so that it doesn't spoil yogurt, salad, etc."
5,VERY effective,The perfect food container for hot lunches on cold days. Big enough to accomodate a hearty appetite. Pre-warm it with hot water before adding food and it will keep your food warm for hours. highly recommend.
4,Love it!,"This thermos works great for hot lunches for my kids. It has just the right amount of food storage for a good portion of mac' n cheese, soup, rice and meatballs, etc. Food stays warm (though does cool some) especially if you put it in piping hot. I chose this because it isn't plastic and won't leach dioxins in to food. The directions say not to use the dishwasher, so I hand wash the lid but put the main part in the dishwasher. I only wish I could put the whole thing in the dishwasher."
3,"Seals well, but does not keep food hot","I bought this in the 16 Oz size because my daughter wanted to take soup for school lunch. I heated the soup to piping hot in the morning, and filled the thermos with hot water for a few minutes before pouring the soup in as it is supposed to help keep it hot that way. By lunch time, her soup just warm she said. She was fine with it though and told me that it did not leak. It has a good seal."
5,great for taking your own coffee to work!,"I bought this over a year ago and use it weekly!!! The seal is tight and I like that you can reach inside to get it really clean vs. my thermos that does not have access beyond a brush to clean inside....I make my own coffee or fruit smoothies and take them with me on the subway in this. It also works great in summer to use at home as a glass because the base is wide and will not fall over, and it keeps the drink (with ice) very cold for a long time even without the lid on it....I love straws, so I use it with a straw and ice in summer when at home."
2,Thermos Nissan 10 ounce,"I bought two. My husband packed my daughter's lunch with one while I packed mine with the other. Do need to heat food to VERY hot and seal boiling water in thermos for 5 minutes before filling. However, boiling water in thermos for 15 minutes made no difference. Liquids do better. Beans, rice, pasta and meat were luke warm at best at lunch. My daughter says there is no difference in temperature of her food in this vs thermos we bought at WalMart. I did notice that the bag I packed this in was hot when I arrived at work. Wonder if there is a heat retaining sleeve of some sort out there??!!"
3,Good but not great.,"We pack lunches around 7:00 AM and these containers do a good job of keeping the food warm until lunchtime, not hot but warm enough to work.The flaw in these containers are the lids. They seal so tightly to the jar that they can be difficult to open. Additionally, the inset on the lid it a softer material and it tends to become sticky or gummy. At first I thought something was stuck to the lid but I figured out that the way it is made."
5,"I *heart* you, Nissan thermos","Oh, sweet Nissan thermos, I love you so much I would make out with you if I could.I use this pretty much every day for lunch. It keeps soup hot for up to 5 hours, especially if you follow directions and let it sit for 5 minutes with boiling water before filling it.It's the perfect portion size for lunch. It also does a magnificant job keeping chilled items cold and crisp. It's spillproof and has survived several punishing drops on the asphalt from my messenger bag."
2,"Leaks, doesn't insulate very well, lid is hard to clean","I've been looking for something that I can take soups and curries to work with, and this seemed like a good fit. Unfortunately, there's too much space between the threads of the lid and the body, and the interior gasket is too narrow to fill the gap, resulting in slow but constant leaking the entire time. It'll keep it from spilling if it tips on its side for just a moment, but if it falls over for any longer, you start seeing leakage.While it's certainly better insulated than the pyrex containers I bought it to replace, it doesn't keep things hot; even after heating something up in the morning, by the time lunch rolls around the contents are tepid at best. The lid is also very difficult to clean thoroughly, with a very deep channel around the inside edge that food gets stuck in.It might be a small improvement over non-insulated, snap-top containers, but it's certainly not worth the price they're asking. I'd keep looking."
4,Pretty good. Serve the purpose.,"I bought it to store my hot homemade baby meals (porridge). I usually make the baby meals at 11am and fill the container up with the hot meal (right from the stove) for my baby to eat at around 4pm. It keeps the meal really warm, but not hot - which is good because I only need to let it sit on the counter for couple minutes so it won't be too hot for my baby. It's a pretty small container but perfect for one meal for my 11 month old baby. The design is clean and nice too. Very easy to clean as well. I like it so far."
2,So disappointed,"I have another thermos by this brand and just love it. When I needed a couple wide mouth thermos' for soup it was a no-brainer for me. I could kick myself. This thermos is the perfect size, doesn't leak.. but doesn't keep food hot. By lunchtime the contents are lukewarm at best."
4,Perfect for soup lunches,"This food jar is great for bringing soups or casseroles for lunch; it REALLY keeps the contents warm! I generally heat the soup at 7am and eat around 1pm, and this little guy has not disappointed! The only problem I have noticed so far (the reason for 4 stars) is that it can be tricky to correctly seal, and sometimes the lid appears askew, even after numerous attempts. But, so far, this has not seemed to affect the heat retention or caused any contents to spill."
1,Food doesn't stay hot!,"I'd had great luck with this brand before, so I thought little of paying $24 for this elegant and lightweight food jar. Alas, my lunch will not stay hot, even if I prepare the jar with boiling water beforehand. My fancy new Nissan works no better than the $6 food jar I bought in a Chinatown supermarket."
1,ANTOHER DISAPPOINTMENT,"Here's another example of a great disappointment with the Thermos product. I've heated up my kids chicken nuggets in the over, then wrapped them in foil, and placed them inside @ 7am. Their nuggets were cold by lunchtime @ Noon."
2,Doesn't keep food warm for long,"This container seals well and is great for carrying liquids, and it doesn't break. But I bought it because I wanted my food to stay warm and avoid using the microwave, and it doesn't work for that at all.I followed the instructions and put boiling water in the container for 10 minutes to warm it up, then put in warm food. By lunch time the food is barely lukewarm."
3,Does NOT keep food very hot,"I purchased this for myself, as I like to bring hot soup and stew to work with me for lunch. I love the fact that it is stainless steal, but it does not keep my food as hot as I would like. I always pour boiling water into it to warm it up in the morning when my soup is heating on the stove. The soup is always very hot when I pour it into the pre-warmed thermos. But when I eat lunch approx. 4 1/2 hour later the soup is luke warm :(I keep it in the closet of my office which is 68-70 degrees until lunchtime, so it is not as though it is exposed to very cold temperatures from the outside.It works about as well as an old plastic one I was using before for retaining heat, but I do like the fact that I am no longer using plastic.If you are looking for something to keep your food really hot, don't purchase this, keep looking."
5,Kids have used ~4x/week for over 3 years...,"And this thermos has held up absolutely fine. I pre-heat with hot water (microwave some water for 3 minutes and then fill each thermos and tighten the lid). Then once the kids are settled with breakfast, I turn back to the thermos for lunch. My kids have had leftovers (pasta, mashed potatoes, even potroast!), soup, spaghettio's, even mini ravioli. I heat up the lunch to a temp that is warmer than I would actually serve, and fill the water-emptied thermos. We have never had a leak unless the kids didn't finish their lunch and didn't put the lid on all the way, and there has never been a problem with food being cold. This product absolutely exceeded my expectation. PS - I wash them out with hot water/soap using a bottle brush, and have no ""smell"" problems at all."
5,"Great, durable, very well insulated Thermos","Kids take it to school every day. Keeps everything very hot. We own 3 of these, one of this size and two of the larger size. Very durable. They never leak. Wide mouth. Easy to load; easy to clean. Easy for kids to open and close. A must have if you want your to send your kids to school with hot, healthy meals. Put kids meals on with a marker or engraver to avoid loss. The 10-oz size uses the same size lid as the 16 oz; they are interchangeable. These are hard to find in stores; better to order online."
5,A must read for staying safe online!,"This is the second edition of the previously read/critiqued Netcrimes and Misdemeanors book.Once again, the author fills the pages with important and vital information about how to stay safe online. From scammers to hoaxes, stalkers and ebay, even online dating and keeping children safe from online predators, this book is packed with real life examples of how people made mistakes that made them a target for some online psycho. But not only does it have the mistakes that lead to the problem, it has the solutions and tricks to avoid the situation in the first place as well!Both versions of this book are useful to anyone that surfs online, but I would urge people to get the second edition as it contains updated links and information. Learn to be safe online! Buy this book for yourself and anyone you know who's a newbie to the online world. You never know... it might just save their life."
4,GREAT toy for 8 month old!!!,"I bought this for my 6 month old and attached it to his bouncey seat. It's great because it can be attached to all sorts of things besides your stroller! It's well made and is very cute. He can't operate all of the buttons by himself but he's quite entertained with it when I press them for him so I think in 2 more months, he will love this even more!"
1,I hate it,I hate it. It is expensive and it did not fit on either of my stollers.So I bougt it and it does not get used ever. I feel like I just waist my money.
5,fast service,"I recieved my order faster than I thought I would.After I got it,I just had to try it on. Hubby & I both like it,the way it fits..the way it looks..the way it feels."
2,Beware!,This is advertised and billed as card stock but is cover stock. Wrapper was totally trashed and it was not packed well.
1,The paper is good but...,"The Astrobright paper itself is good, but it came in the packaging in the picture but all torn apart. It looks like it fell down a flight of stairs. The corners are bent, I just hope it makes it threw my printer. Also one side has a green streak from were it rubbed up against the Terra Green Astrobright paper I ordered. That packaging was also destroyed. Next time I'll go back to the first seller I brought from. It was in a thick plastic packing almost like it was ready for a store shelf. That's was I get for trying to save 50 cents. Lesson learned."
5,Economical card stock that works well with laser printers,"This is my go-to brand of card stock when I need an economical booklet or flyer. It holds up well in laser printers, either black and white or color prints look sharp and the paper has a nice smooth finish."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't buy this piece of crap. It doesn't really have what it says. It just has 6 matches. 3 in madrid and 3 in Brcelona and which are not the best, they were just choosen 3 seasons to put in the 90's and that's it.If you are a real fan of one of these two teams don't waste your money, it seems that it was made by an American for Japanese people."
2,Well I guess you should get it... IF...,"IF you are a super dooper Naruto Fan, this is the beginning of the SUPER FILLERS of the series which DOES NOT Follow the Manga at all. For those who want something to FILL their time until SHIPPUDEN Box Sets Arrive this would be what you want.For those who want true to the books STOP HERE your collection is done. Go buy other sets."
3,not so informative,"I think Chirunning is a more useful book, if you are looking for information on running form. The only useful thing I got out of this book was the part on premeditation of race strategies."
3,Retro Explosion!,"Black Forest Explosion! is an extensive anthology of Jankowski's work from 1968 to 1973. While most of the tracks have a made-for-TV feel, the arrangements for both the popular remakes and his original works are usually interesting and gratifying. And it's fun to hear the Beatles' FOOL ON THE HILL and the Carpenter's WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN sung in German. Jankowski shows his mature style with a reprise of his hit, WALK IN THE BLACK FOREST, played very jazzy, but without the innocence of the original track (from THE GENIUS OF JANKOWSKI). This collection will especially interest those who like the perky, quirky style and instrumentation that marked the late '60s."
1,Still wondering,"Not that informative and not much detail. Anyone bothering to obtain and watch a travel video wants more specifics. We're still wondering about going, although the region does look beautiful."
4,A Cool way to get to sleep,Good entertainment:We're currently processing your review and we will email you at warrenwh@pacbell.net as soon as this is complete.
3,Disappointed.,"Nothing wrong with them, except that they're pretty tasteless. I had hoped they'd be like Social Tea biscuits - they're definitely not. Not worth the large quantity you have to buy. I may use them to make cookie crumb pie crusts - with a lot of doctoring!"
5,Fireweed: A Political Autobiography,"This book captures one from the beginning and one of the most impressive parts of this reading is the outlining of historical events prior to and after WWI and WWII and how these things affected the author's life. She was overly focused on anti-facism, and yes, she did suffer quite a lot, the term was overused in this book and though she was a politico, I'd like to have seen this reference lessened and heard more of her later years."
4,Worked as advertised. Easy hook-up.,Plugged it in. It worked great. Using it on my LG ST600 streaming device. Using DVI video connection so sound had to come in on separate toslink cable which was not supported by my old Mitsubishi projection TV. Price was OK too.
5,Works Well,This thing is light and it looks cheap at first but it does work well. My receiver only has 2 S/PDIF ports and I was using both of them so when I bought a 360 I need to use this to carry my audio from an optical toshlink cable(digital) to coax cable (digital) for 5.1 suround sound through my receiver. I can notice any loss of quality when using this and but cables fit firmly into place... Well worth the modest price.
2,Works good (for a while),"I had to get this converter in order to run from my new hdtv that had only optical digital audio out to an older surround sound system that had only digital coaxial in. This saved me from having to buy a new surround sound.edit: After only about 9 months I began to have problems with it cutting in and out on occasion. Now, after 11 months it seems completely dead."
5,Works like a champ,"The only hitch I had was that they initially sent me the wrong unit; the IN and OUT were reversed. Once I sent pictures of what I had received verses what I ordered, I got the correct replacement unit and return shipping for the wrong one in fairly short order. Since installing it, I have not had to touch it at all, and that was over a year ago. I now get 5.1 surround on all of my inputs that support it (upconverting HDMI DVD player, HD-DVD player, Blu-ray player, and broadcast TV).Life is good."
1,Did not work at all. Threw my money away.,I tried to convert the digital coax optical out from toshiba tv to digital optical in on sound bar. This converter did not work in sending sound from the tv to the sound bar.
1,My 1st poor review,"1st item I have purchased EVER (from anyone, in all these years) that was DOA (dead on arrival). It never worked. I opened the case and found the PC Board of the adapter was water damaged .... I have to wonder if it was used and re-packaged. Very diasppointed with this purchase."
1,cuts in and out,Worked for a week then started cutting in and out. It would work until I moved the entertainment center back then would cut out. It also would not connect sometimes.
1,defective twice?,"I hooked up the digital optical to digital coaxial converter and went to try it and it didn't work. I tested it from differnt sources with differnt optical cables so I know its not on my end. Are these products tested? I was so disappointed. I call up amazon and complained about the product.They are shipping me another one.One good thing was that the shipping was quick. However, what good is quick shipping if a product doesn't work?Update: I received a new converter and again it did not work. No instructions, no customer service number to call. I was trying to go from ps3 optical out to converter to coaxial digital in on receiver. No red or green led light to indicate that the converter is actually on. What kind of product is this? Thank god for the friendly assistance from the amazon reps. They refunded my money.As for the product , don't buy it!"
4,Good buy,"Not gonna lie, the converter is kinda cheap looking but the sound quality delivered is outstanding, it made a HUGE difference on the sound I'm getting now from my PS3. Totally worth the money."
5,"Excellent Product, painless installation",Installed product on my new Panasonoic Blueray player which does not have a coppper digital output required for my old Home Theater audio system. It worked at once flawlessly. I fully recommend it.
5,Great Product,This converter works great for me.I've had no problems what so ever with it.I couldn't have gotten a better one.You could pay much more for a converter and still not have one as good as this one.
3,Gets choppy at some point,"Well, it does the job, but sometimes it just dies then restarts. Changed my Receiver to a better one with optical link. If you dont have any other choice go with it."
3,only 2 channel output,I wish in the description it would've stated this product does not output 5.1 surround. I ordered theCables to Go 40019 Optical to Coaxial Digital Audio Converter (Black)which does output DTS and dolby digital 5.1. other then that the product does do what it states it does. I had no problems with anything else.
5,Worked for years,I've had this behind my tv for a few years working reliably. I forgot I even had it back there it works so well. No noticeable loss of sound quality.
2,Average Product,"I tried ordering this from amazon but never actually got the item. I ended up having to order from monoprice (which the amazon seller appeared to be purchasing from anyways). Regardless, I bought this because of the good reviews, but it ends up having audio issues. Occasionally the sound will go out for a second and then come back. That's why I'm giving it such low scores."
4,Bryan hits the style button,"Ferry`s - The Bride Stripped Bare, is an album which really shows Ferry at his best in terms of his early solo work and succesfully bridges the lean mid seventies period. This album contains an eclectic selection of covers (mostly R&B and Soul)and originals supported by a strong cast of Brit Rock champions. Highlights include Can`t Let Go, a great driving song, What Goes On from Velvet Underground, a beautiful rendition of a traditional Irish lilt ""Carrickfergus"" which Ferry takes ownership of. Sign of the Times which sounds like it should have been on Roxy Music`s Siren. An intense, theatrical, This Island Earth and some sublime vocal performances, Thats How Strong my Love Is. Same Old Blues. Ferry demonstrates his love of R&B and his ability to mimic the genre. An overlooked album which did not receive the sales that it should have."
4,Compelling hybrid,"This is an interesting record! Half originals, half covers. Some longstanding musical partners, some hired gun session musicians. The sound is quite straightforward, certainly as mainstream as any Bryan Ferry-associated record. The new HDCD remasters of the Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry catalogs are fabulous."
4,Ferry's Best Solo Album,"This is Ferry's best solo work. The production doesn't sound horribly dated like some of his 80's and 90's stuff; the covers aren't bizzare or kitschy (""what goes on"" is wonderful, as is ""carickfergus""). But the originals are what makes the album the best of his solo lot with ""Sign of the Times"" and ""When she walks in the room"" standing out as compositions worthy enough to be on ""Siren""."
2,...and so is the music.,"Strictly for completists only, I'm afraid. Starts out with the rollicking Sign of the Times but quickly deteriorates from there (unless you're into needless covers). For a better take on taking on the music of others, try These Foolish Things which far outshines this snore-fest. And for the ultimate Ferry solo effort, run, don't walk towards In Your Mind. It covers the bases of Ferry's talents more convincingly than this late '70s filler."
3,Weathers Poorly,We've have this for 2-3 years and it is already showing it's age. It looked great installed in our brick mailbox at the end of our driveway but it gets a sort of white flim over it all the time. We maybe should have got the silver version. Perhaps the white is a salt residue from the roads? The Lock still works great and we rarely get damp mail. Love that our mail is a little more secure than your standard mailbox.
1,Does NOT do what it says on the box!,"In the UK we had the ""Trades Description Act"", whereby if somebody over there sold you an air conditioner that actually made the room hotter you could sue! This is a piss poor unit, badly made, badly put together, badly designed, it is a BAD buy! Kenwood had such a good name..........once! Switch your manufacturing to China and you suffer the consequences! Avoid this like the plague, save up a bit more, wait a bit, suck ice from the fridge, anything but buy this crappy little thing! Wait until you can afford the real deal, go to a store, test and try before you buy! The Internet is NOT the best place to buy stuff like this. CDs...yes! Books...yes! Get a proper unit from an American company!! Get in yer car, drive downtown, find a family firm, ask for ""Pop"" or ""Mom"", listen to their advice, pay a bit more and you will get the benefit of their experience!"
2,Don't expect to get this in one piece,"Like others have said before me, the Engineer that designed the packaging for this unit needs to go back and get his degree again. This unit arrived with the box falling apart and was delivered upside down because the bottom was falling open. Parts were missing and the unit was broken.This is not the type of unit you want to purchase and have delivered across the country.I called Amazon (In India) and after several calls was able to get them to replace the unit with the Delonghi."
2,Poor packing--damaged product,"The first unit I recieved appeared to have been dragged behind the delivery truck. The plastic casing was smashed in several places. Amazon customer service promptly sent me another unit which arrived with a broken coaster. I'm keeping this one to avoid the re-shipping hassle, but dissapointed with the purchase."
2,"Noisy, and does not cool","I bought one of these a few months ago and just today hooked it up. It seems to be doing its job (on a fairly cool day), but it is sooooo noisy. White noise I can live with, but the condenser rattles and shakes in a way that is rather startling (""What's that???"") throughout the house. Too late to return it, but I think it will be used only on the hottest of days. (I'll edit to tell you how it does on a hothot day when we get one of them.)Edit: it does not cool even one small room. At all. Total waste of money. I can't seem to edit my rating down to one star, but it should be starless."
2,Doesn't work for long!!!,I bought one of these piles of junk and it didn't even work for a month!! It no longer blows cold air out and actually heats up a room more than cools it now...what a piece of junk! Don't get this brand.
3,Dave O,"I recently purchased this unit from Amazon, When it arrived the packaging was crushed and looked as if it had been returned and resond cause alot of the styrofoam was broken. After unpacking everything was intact with all parts ok. After using it a few weeks the unit is noisy [I use it in my bedroom} and constantly needs to adjust the temp to stay comfortable. The digital display of your settings is no where near the actual temp. When the compressor runs it makes clunking sounds and constantly wakes me. The KW85 makes me wish it was fall!"
5,Nostalgically noteworthy,"Great CD for those who remember this track; mixes in order as to popularity and were as expected. Item seems to be out-of-print (or otherwise not availability digitally), adding value and nostalgia to an era that, well, just doesn't seem that long ago (but is). The seller I worked with was esp. awesome: bargain price, super-fast shipment, almost didn't mind it not being a download. Makes ya wonder where Shelley Nelson is now...."
2,POSTER MEASURES ARE NOT REAL,"The description read 50.80 by 152.40 cms but I got the poster has no such measures is smaller, That was very disappointing, indicate the actual measurement.My poster measures 30 cm x 149 cmThe print quality and excellent color"
3,Had no problem,"Product in perfect conditions as it should be as a new item, resistant package assuring the safety of it. Got there when I was told it should.Produto em perfeito estado como deveria (item novo), embalagem assegurava integridade do produto, chegou no prazo."
2,Didn't taste that good.,I've had pickled eggs before and most were very good. These didn't taste good at all:(
4,Grows a little every time you hear it,"When I first heard this album I was rather sceptical. Being an Elegy fan from the early days, I did not care for the new singer Ian Parry. Although he is perhaps ten times as good as the guy they had before, he just couldn't write vocal melodies in the same way. However, having listened to it a couple of times it started to grow. It is a very good album and Ian's voice is great. Check out song no. 3 ""Trust"" it's a killer!"
5,Recommended reading re: JRA,"It's nice, simple reading for all. As one of the only autobiographies by a person with JRA, Nicole's Story is a nice resource for understanding, sympathizing, and empathizing if you have JRA. My daughter has JRA and I'm sure she'll be glad to have this book so she can see that she is not alone. I think I'll share it with her teachers and classmates too."
5,simply the best,"i purchased this cd on the strength of curtiss's vocals i heard in the track ""surfin' bird"". as such, i was quirte prepared to accept that the remainder of the 36 tracks on this cd might not be to my musical tastes. however, how wrong i was. every, and i mean every song on this great cd is fantastic and had me tapping my foot and rocking out. curtiss's ""puddy cat (mama-meow-mow)"" is his answer to ""surfin' bird"" and is completely crazy! simply one of the best tracks i have ever heard. what i really like about this cd is the radio interviews and radio adverts for the rhythm rockers from 50s radio. this really gives the cd a great rockabilly feel. what's more, bright lights comes with a thick inlay which details the early life of wade curtiss and his career.if you love rockabily and stomp beats, then this album is for you. grab it now!"
1,quality control stinks on this product,"Was DOA. You would think they would at least make sure they worked when they left the factory, but I guess not."
3,Hard to Empty,"I purchased this for a specific job cleaning out heating ducts where there was some water leakage. I thought it would also come in handy for small spills around the house. I live in an RV, so size for storage was also important.It does seem to have decent suction, but is somewhat awkward to use if you are not holding it as it is very top heavy and tends to fall over. I also found it difficult to empty, as I have arthritis in my hands and you must push in tabs with your thumbs and lift the motor off at the same time.All in all, it does what it's supposed to do, but I would not recommend this product if you have any difficulty using your hands."
3,Frequently Bought Together is Wrong,The picture of the 3 pack of Disposable Filter Bags in the Frequently Bought Together area don't go to this unit. The bags go to the 1.5 Gal Vac not the 1 Gal vac.
5,Remote Viewer Close Up Is A Must Read,"Having personally known Joe McMoneagle for some five years now, I was amazed at all the things I didn't know about him, but learned from reading his moving and carefully crafted autobiography. The general public will be both entertained and enlightened concerning the world heavyweight champion of RV and the history of remote viewing, and us former intel types will find some of our own memories being awakened by Joe's tales of places and personalities past. This guy has all ""the right stuff"" and his Stargate Chronicles should be on the shelves of everyone interested in the paranormal and intelligence matters."
5,I can see clearly now--the rain is gone...,"This is the personal story (warts and all)of a man that can literally find lost people (in many cases for years) by ""remote viewing"" them (a government-funded, double blind studied --protocalled-- aproach). And much more.Mr. McMoneagle has several other books--and you should read them as well--but this one gives an inside...view...into the man, much of the process itself--and the life that brought him to this point.It takes courage to write a book like this.What if your life really were ""an open book""?If you want to understand remote viewing--read this for the inside personal feel of what it felt like to be absolutely elemental in the original Govt. supported ""Stargate"" program. If you want to understand...more...complex human behavior--you might need to read this book. Ever turned...and made immediate eye contact with someone? READ THIS...Well, you get the idea!Heather Raymond AND;Henry Raymond Author, ""The Third Kind of Midnight"""
3,Weak Entry,"There was nothing about this book that grabbed me. I was constantly waiting for it to get better, but the end came first. If it had cost any more than $2.99 I would have been angry. As it is I am just mildly annoyed."
5,Comprehensive,This set is a very comprehensive explanation of all that is Windows 2000. I have read the Windows 2000 Server book in its entirety (all 1800+ pages) and have gained enough confidence in the operating system and my knowledge of such to implement it in a production environment. I've started the other three books and they all have the same easy to understand explanations that make these books enojoyable. This is the first Minasi book I've read and now I will seek out his books.
4,Fish hooks,"These are the best hooks for lake fishing and the next time I run low, I'll order from Amazon. The price can't be beat."
4,Excellent Photographs,"This is a fantastic view of the working Quarter horse in the American west. Lots of working horses, broodmare bands, ranches , stallions, and all of the American Quarter Horse, which has grown to be as big an icon of the American west as the mustang. And yes, the Quarter horse is the single most popular breed in the USA and probably the world. A great addition to any coffee table and library."
5,so awsome,"this album is really awsome i personally like skeletor vs. beastman and pantyhoes pornshop. get this album really fast,and watch the skeletor v.s. beastman video!"
3,didnt help my dogs dandruff or itching,hoped this would helptried everything to avoid shotsit's good to alternate shampoosso i dont mind using it
5,GREAT...GREAT....GREAT,"I was leery to replace my old duffel bag, because I had it for like 10 years, but getting this one made the transition easier, because it has lots of room, compartments are convenient and its really sturdy and good looking. I love it."
2,Skip this clock,"I wouldn't recommend this alarm clock. It only has one buzzer and it's very annoying. It is easy to use, but my son hates it after less than a year because it's such a nasty way to wake up. Get an alarm clock with a radio or buzzer option for the same $."
1,Not worth it!,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and took it back because we couldn't see the numbers clearly, even when pressed down. No matter how cheap it is, it's not worth it!"
1,Don't buy me,I bought this for my daughter's birthday. Upon arrival the clock did not work. LCD did not display. I went to pull the batteries out of the back and the spring came with it. Please save your money.
1,so small,This item was so small I almost didnt know what it was....until I looked and saw spongebob on top
3,Thank you!,"Thank you for taking care of the wrong product item being sent. I appreciate you took care of it as soon as were able too. I would redo my feedback, but it would not let me. Thank you and I will be sending the other item out on Monday the 9th of May 2011. Thanks Again,Cindy Maier"
4,good resource,"While I haven't used this book to shop until I drop, I have used it when I want to shop for something specific. It is organized by type of items sold but also has an index in the back that allows you to see what stores are in a certain location (by city). I like the latter because I found there was a store I used to go to elsewhere (out of my way) right around the corner from my office. I also use it to find other stores that are near a place I am already headed for."
1,Very disappointing,"I can only assume that this, and, what is in my view, its partner CD; ""Plastic Wood"" were released to meet some contractual commitment with the label. Perhaps not but they are both scraping the proverbial barrel in my view. I never thought that I would say that about anything to do with Lloyd Cole. I have followed him throughout his career, seen him live on numerous occasions and feel sorry for anyone who buys this CD as an introduction to the artist. Please, please do not be put off. The rest of his catalogue is mostly wonderful, occasional just plain good and never not worth listening to."
4,Good CD,"Worth buying...the cd contains 9 songs. Favorites being Don't Scream, Down, Dreamer, From Here, Better, and Feel It. If you are looking for a cd from a great new band...here it is."
1,"PhD Student, But not in Philosophy...","This is one of the most difficult books that I have had to read in my academic career. This is not an introductory text, and the language makes it extremely difficult to get through, or to obtain a full grasp of the concepts presented. If you are a student or teacher, please find another book, because most students will take very little from this book except for frustration and a disdain for anything claiming to be a ""theory of knowledge."" Some might say that I am not smart enough to understand what this text was trying to communicate; however, that is the point of this entry, it is a very difficult book to read, and it is not appropriate for anyone except for the well versed in philosophy. But if you are that well versed in philosophy, please, do us all a favor and use your skills to write a clearer and more accessible text."
5,"This is a nice, quick reference","I got this book from Amazon.com on discount. So, it was a good value. For less than $10 (including shipping) I got a book with lots of good information. This book gives a complete break down of Battleship classes. Example: The USS Michigan is of the South Carolina Class. The USS New Jersey is of the Iowa class.Also, this book has a wonderful break down of the number of battleships in service by a decade breakdown from 1900 to 2000. The USA had 30 Battleships in service during 1910. We only had 23 in service in 1945. It was 0 in 1960.This is a good value for the money. I build Battleshps. So, I needed a quick reference. I have been happy with the purchase.So, fellow Battleship fan, this book is worth your money."
5,A superbly crafted regional history,"One River Two Cultures: A History Of The Bella Coola Valley is a thoroughly researched historical account told in a friendly, narrative style of the beautiful Bella Coola Valley deep within the central coast wilderness of British Columbia. Black-and-white photographs illustrate this chronicle, which tells of the Nuxalkmc people whose culture was heavily intertwined with the natural and spiritual world; the drastic changes that came about when gold-seekers, traders, missionaries and a group of Norwegian settlers came; to modern-day conflicts concerning the land and the extent to which its resources should be consumed. Award-winning writer Paula Wild gathers the rich and complex story of the valley and the people who called it home into a smoothly flowing whole, that absorbs the reader from cover to cover. A superbly crafted regional history."
5,at their best: live and raw,"I have listened to all their stuff--studio and otherwise---and this is the best of their recordings. These guys were never meant to be in the confines of a studio and this recording shows why. Listen to Been By the Mountain, Been By the Sea."
5,Unbelievable price for 50 batteries!,I needed coin cell batteries to fit my Streamlight Nano minature flashlight and these 50 batteries cost less than what I found elsewhere for just 10 batteries. Great deal and never run out of batteries.
4,The product is not dated,"I purchased these as spares and have not tested them yet, but I am giving this product one star less already because there was no manufacture or expiration date on the package. After I complained, the seller quickly responded assuring that the batteries are fresh and have the shelf life of about 3 years. I actually hoped it would be longer than that (this is where the date on the packaging would be informative). I should also mention that the batteries are made in China for a Russian company (according to the text in Russian), and this is not necessary a negative detail. The basic information about the product is also available in other langugaes."
2,Very weak,These batteries are very weak. i am using them in flashlight and it was enough for a half time then usually other batteries. At all not recommended.
4,Great Sword! Great Shipping!,"I am a die-hard zelda fan and from playing all the zelda games, this is a great sword for any zelda fan. The blade is not razor sharp but can easily cut thru a watermelon, which in my case is good because I have no intention of slaying someone ( it is a bit heavy may I add) . My only complaint is when I got it (on time) the sword was slightly curved. This was due to the sheathe which is leather and flexible and probably got knocked around during shiping. But, I fixed it the second day I had it and it was as good as new. In any case, this sword is a must for cosplay, movie prop, adding to a collection, cutting a watermelon (laughs), or just feeling like Link with this awesome sword. By the way I am 13 years old."
2,Looks Good...Less filling,"The visual display is nice. However, the blade is so thin it cannot support it's own weight. There is an obvious bow if you hold it out horizontally. Good for wall display, but would not recommend for costume use. If you were to actually ""use"" this sword (such as for a movie prop) I suspect it might break or at least permanently bend. Look for a high quality thicker grade blade than we found."
4,master sword,"i just got the sword today and let me tell you this: this sword is great, it looks just like the picture, the sword is decently heavy(maby 7 pounds) it arived two days after i ordered it. it's a great sword for display, cosplay, and for just playing with, it comes with a display stand, the sword (of corse), and a scabbard. the scabbard is just a black scabbard with a few almost invisable decals, the blade is a bit dulled down. overall i give it 4 stars, oh i'm 13"
2,Meh,I got this sword a while ago and I think the best word to describe it is flimsy. The blade makes a comical wobbling sound if you move it even slightly sideways. The hilt is alright but the color is a little too bluish. This sword is only good for display and even so there are better looking ones out there.It's not terrible but you could probably get something that looks and feels significantly better for the same amount of money.
2,Sub-par sword and decoration.,"Only good in case of zombie uprising. Handle is cheap lacquered metal and the tang is not full. Blade, when held at right angle, bows. Looks ugly. Worth the $50 if you plan on putting it somewhere far away from eyes. Look at other replicas for better."
1,Making up stuff,"In yet another excuse to push his Buddhist view over reality, the author makes claims which are simply untrue; i.e.: the so-called connection between Je Tsongkhapa and Dorje Shugden. As a previous reviewer points out, there is no connection. Gyatso just made this up to suit his particular controversial brand of Buddhism. The book is chocked-full of questionable Buddhist theories, based in part of the author's political agenda. As a result, there are enough questionable passages here to make this an utterly unreliable source of Dharma teachings."
4,Some Other Great Albums,"I am a big fan of roots music. This album is a fantastic treat that consistently delivers great music, song after song. If you enjoy this album and are looking for some similar great roots albums then I recommend the following:1) Appalachian Stomp: Bluegrass Classics2) Avalon Blues by Mississippi John Hurt3) March 16-20 by Uncle Tupelo4) Beautiful Dreamer: The Songs Of Stephen Foster5) Every Sound Below by Tim Eriksen"
2,Nothing to get excited about,"I'm a big fan of this brand of music, but I'm afraid this CD is nothing to get excited about. Some of the covers here are okay, but most of them are weak. Sometimes is the musicianship, sometimes it's the poor production quality. Either way it just doesn't quite add up to a CD worth owning."
3,"Support the artists, not the middle man","Make no mistake, the music on this cd is really great. Do some research online and you'll probably find more than I did, but I did find that Kris Delmhorst's version of Ain't No Grave is on the Signature Records sampler and Scott Murawski (from Max Creek)'s song with Mark McKay was played on David Gans' Grateful Dead Hour. You can find free downloads if you poke around online. The musicians here did respectable work, all of them, and I do recommend the cd. However, these compilations bug me because I know the artists don't get one dime for ""donating"" their songs. So I personally recommend buying THEIR OWN discs from the artists you like on this. Not that you shouldn't buy this cd (although maybe just burning a copy would be a perfect compromise to be able to hear the music), but these things are an injustice."
4,Legacy of John Barnes Chance,A great collection of music that captures a snap shot of a gifted composer. A great addition to any library of band music.
3,A more entertaining self-help type book,"Exploring issues such as happiness, friendship, love, insight, patience, among many others, I would recommend this book to anyone looking to enhance their own life and relationships. The novel has many themes present in many self-help books, but delivered through the story of one man and the challenges he faces. While the story is about a guitar maker, there is little reference to music theory, repertoire, etc. and one should not be detered from reading this if they do not have a background in music as the story is definitely about happiness and life-learning which we can all relate to."
5,A GREAT READ,"A piece I wrote about Jack Kerouac was recently published in Blue Moon Literary & Art Review, an up and coming Davis, California journal. After a reading event, a Kerouac fan gave me a copy of THE BEAT HOTEL by Barry Miles. Read this book if you have interest in the Beats, especially their intense relationships with their contemporaries. Some of the material is a retelling of accounts, much will add to your knowledge about these multifaceted writers. Barry Miles has studied the Beat generation for 30+ years. This is not his first book about them. I hope that it won't be his last."
4,"Interesting friends, interesting lives","Throughout 1957 and 1963, members of the Beat movement - primarily Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, and Brion Gysin (and Peter Orlovsky, although he was mostly just along for the ride with Ginsberg) lived (on and off) in an old, low rent hotel in Paris at 9 Git-Le-Rue. During these years they experimented with various literary forms and a multitude of drugs, and created a large body of their work. There were many interesting relationship dynamics going on amongst them all, and most of all this book focuses on those relationships and how they affected each of their respective creative output.The author is in love with both Ginsberg and Burroughs though, so the narrative is somewhat skewed. He seems to have unfavorable reactions to Corso's drinking, for instance, but practically glorifies Burroughs' practice of drug-induced creativity. Still, it's an interesting account of the time spent in Paris."
4,L'hotel Maynard G K,"Like, baby, I am not a big fan of the beats, dig? I was too young for it - it was dead by the time I was aware of it. And in hindsight it seems so self-indulgent.But.This book is really great. I lived in Paris for a spell, not far from said hotel (though it was long gone) and this is wonderfully interesting chronicle of ex pat life in Paris during the late 50s, early 60s, a bunch of fabulously interesting characters - reminiscent of Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London (or whatever it was called) which was pretty darn clever (and if you like this, you have to read that.)"
4,A great introduction to the beats,"Perhaps 9, rue Git-le-Coeur will never be one of those addresses that everyone immediately recognizes. Yet, for a brief period of time, it was home to Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, Peter Orlovsky, Brian Gysin, and was infamously known as The Beat Hotel.""The Beat Hotel"" serves as an extended biographical sketch, presenting detailed glimpses into the histories of these artists - Burroughs' accidental shooting of his wife, his intense love affair with Ian Sommerville, Ginsberg's problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother, the ""Howl"" obscenity trials, his affairs with Burroughs, Kerouac and Orlavsky.What results is an often frank, always engaging depiction of the drugged out, free-loving world that produced such classic as Burroughs' ""Naked Lunch"" and Ginsberg's ""Kaddish.""It's to the author's credit that he achieves and exceeds his goal of increasing the reader's appreciation of these often neglected rebel artists."
4,Solva Saal,"I have always loved Dev Anand's old films and this is no exception. A predictable story but enjoyably told. Great going, Dev, thank you for so much enjoyment dished out to so many people over so many years."
1,not worth the buy,"when we first opened up the package, the umbrella fabric wasn't attached to the metal prongs. i should have known this would be an issue. every time we would close and then open the umbrella, the fabric would pop off and expose the pointy metal prongs of the umbrella. no matter how many times i would fix it, it would break. i contemplated gluing the item or sewing it together, but after spending significant money on the item, i decided it wasn't worth it to fix. the umbrella is cute; i just wish it was made with better quality. now we will return it and get something a little safer."
1,Fall apart umbrella,This umbrealla fell apart the first day I got it. My 10 year old loved the design but couldn't use it because the ends would keep falling off everytime he closed it.
4,good deal,lacking a star cause the quality is kind of itchy and is good for short term. four stars because that is all I expected
3,Well priced childrens costume,"I got this for my 23 month old for halloween. The costume fit fine, pretty much true to size. Probably wouldn't fit him next year at almost 3yrs. The quality was ok....a lot of little tears here and there. But, it served its purpose for the night."
2,Cheaply made,We bought this superman costume for our son's first Halloween. We are very disappointed at its quality.The fabric is so thin that you can almost see through it. We were even worried to torn it apart when we put it on our son.The cheap quality doesn't justify its price.
3,Meh,"It's a cute costume, but the quality is not very good. It feels like a thinner version of felt. It's true that the sizes run really small. I bought the 2-4yr old size for my 22 month old and it fits him almost perfectly. I can't imagine a 4-yr old fitting into it. The back of the superman suit doesn't have a closure. The cape is velcroed on to the suit to cover the opening in the back. I guess for this age, this is good enough. You can actually wear clothes underneath if it's cold outside. I kind of wish the material wasn't as cheapy feeling. I paid $[...] for it, but I think it should have been more like $[...] for the quality. Oh well."
3,OK for the price,"Pros: Good enough for the price.Cons: - Quality of cape and the velcro attachment to the dress is not good.- No buttons on back, just one at the top near the neck and one at the bottom. I guess the cape is expected to cover it. :-)"
2,Boring,I found the book to be dull and not very informative. It was a waste of money. There are much better books out there. Did not help me prepare for the exam. Answers to questions were simplistic and not complete.
4,Review of African Angels,"A lot can be said about a book that attempts to speak to the mind, body and soul of man but I will be brief and say that I am impressed with the eloquence of Keenan Pendergrass. And, in the same breath I'd compliment him on capturing the life force of the African American church. After growing up in the black church community and having heard many sermons, I could almost hear the words of the minister flowing through Pendergrass's words. Lastly, I applaud him for achieving the feat of writing a book about personal strength and collective power."
2,Hm.,This is OK. But not very good. Get a better book. Something new and fresh. The person who wrote this must have been drunk.
5,The inside look from outside the ring...,"On the Ropes takes you inside boxing....not pro boxing where everyone has money, but young-people's boxing in urban NY, where they fight for their lives and struggle to break out of ""their"" ring. The film is such a perfect metaphor for life in an urban american city.What makes this film even more remarkable, is that it's all true. And not one of those washed out 'based on fact' movies. On The Ropes is a feature documentary about real people fighting real battles in and out of the boxing ring, and its production style is gritty, entangled and subsequently perfect, for the metaphor continues...the lives of the people it documents is gritty and entangled and complex.I highly recommend this film for viewing. If you're a boxing fan, you HAVE to see it, and if you are interested in real life drama, you have to see it."
4,Dreamers Chasing a Dream,"On the Ropes follows three talented (but troubled) boxers from Brooklyn as they train for the Golden Gloves.The film's best story concerns the tension between George and his trainer, Harry. Harry got George started as a boxer. But George, the most-talented of the three fighters, caught the eye of a successful manager. The manager begins moving George away from Harry in order to push him toward the ""big time."" The viewer feels for Harry, who seems to be a decent person.The other two boxers are Tyrene and Noel. Tyrene is a young woman who shows promise in the ring. But she must resolve drug charges before she can focus on boxing. Noel is uninteresting; he is inarticulate and shows little talent for boxing.On the Ropes leaves the viewer dissatisfied. The film tells the beginning and middle of each boxer's story, but we never see the end. Still, the film is worth a look."
5,what a knockout,"after reviewing On The Ropes this video left this student of the game . wanting more. To go beyond the glitz and glamor of winning titles and making millions. to the dark side of the sport.This video delivers a one two punch of realism that can only be hailed as a true reminder that nothing good comes easy, and only the strong surive .Truly this video is championship material.And a Knockout !!!"
3,Entertaining but negative stereotyping,"This is a pretty good documentary, although it's very typical and predictable. It's entertaining to watch, but it's a little bit like the guilty pleasure of watching a car accident. I wonder why so many documentary's are about underprivileged people who can't seem to escape from their poverty induced victim life. I'm not sure what the point of another hard knocks life film is, unless it shows that transcendence is possible. In the case of this film, the depressing stereotypes have only been perpetuated.Personally, I prefer documentaries like When We Were Kings, Shadow Boxers, and Hoop Dreams - films that show us truely inspireing characters we have never seen before. Characters who prove that it is possible to confront your demons, whatever they may be, and win!"
3,it's ok...,"the book is ok...not many things written inside, just a few things underlined. The cover was a bit worn out, tough. But the price was convenient."
1,RIP OFF,"A DOUBLE DVD AND NOT ONE COMPLETE SONG. NOT SOME BUT EVERY SONG IS INTERRUPTED WITH COMMENTARY. WHY COULDN'T THEY PLAY A SONG AND THEN COMMENT ON IT? ALSO, EVERY PARTIAL VIDEO THAT IS PLAYED HAS WRITTEN AT THE TOP OF THE VIDEO WHO IT WAS PRODUCED BY AND IT JUST STAYS UP THERE THE WHOLE TIME MAKING IT DIFFICULT ON SOME PORTIONS TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. I'M A BIG TIME KINKS FAN BUT THIS DVD IS ABSOLUTE JUNK. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I AGREE WITH ANOTHER REVIEWER THAT THIS DVD SHOULD ACTUALLY BE RATED AS ZERO STARS.$32 DOWN THE DRAIN"
1,Duh!,"The former reviewer is obviously working for the company that released this utter piece of crap. I would not touch this set with a ten foot pole. Kinks fans stood stay away from this as far as possible!I tried to give it nil stars but that is not possible, unfortunately......."
2,"OLD games, not worth ten bucks",There was only one game out of 50 that was worth playing for more than 2 ninutes. I know it's only ten bucks but you can find freeware games that are much more interesting. Save your dough on this one.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Another astronomical event causes bad things to happen to poor haplesshumanity. Things crash on the planet, and the seas begin to rise. Thisis a problem as monkey based bipeds required fairly significant amountsof dry land to go about their business on a daily business.However, there are other lifeforms on earth, and some of them livebeneath the waves. They are fairly happy about what is going on. Theremnants of humanity have to make do with less and less land."
1,Like a Newscast Devoid of Footage,"I'm a fan of horror, science fiction, and creatures from the deep. Unfortunately, this novel contains very little of those things. There are few moments where the reader is thrust into the action. Most of the story is comprised of people talking about events that have occurred (sinking ships, towns attacked, plans of action, etc.) while throwing in scientific jargon every now and then for good measure to remind the reader that it isn't a melodrama. A flaccid bore of a book that will test the reader's patience."
4,Apocalypse Then,"Equal parts H.G. Wells, George Orwell, and P.G. Wodehouse, Wyndham made a literary career of bringing his Cold War apocalyptic fears to life. Day of the Triffids, Chrysalis and The Kraken Wakes all paint a largely bleak but ultimately hopeful theme. The Kraken Wakes builds suspense and could teach contemporary writers that they do not have to tell their entire apocalyptic tales on the first page. The dialogue is entertaining as is Wyndham's anti-Soviet focus which cannot be denied (and which now seems quaint). The plot and premise are highly original and though the book seems long, once over, you want it to continue."
2,Inaccurate and missleading,Working through this book on a skin care course was very frustrating. The medical terms used were inaccurate and often contradictory.Althought the basic skin care isues were dealt with efficiently the anatomy and physiology references were not consistent with current medical text books.This publisher has many better books. Avoid this one.
3,update the book,"This textbook is practically the only standard textbook that can be utilized by students preparing to become estheticians. However, the book needs to be brought up to current standards. Do not just print a new edition without updating the information, this stifles the profession!"
4,Great text!,"This book is very thorough, up-to-date, and informative. I found it easy to read and follow, and the contents pages are very well-labeled, making it easy to find the desired information quickly. I would highly recommend this text to anyone looking to learn new skills or brush up on old skills."
1,Not a very good or original book,"This book does not offer many original or insightful ideas about JMX. In fact, a good portion of the book is copied and pasted from the JSR-160 specification. I recommend downloading that and reading it if you're interested in JMX Remoting. The best book on JMX (although a bit dated) is still by Fleury & Lindfors."
1,Poorly written,"The main problem with this books is its lack of concepts.It tries to delve direcly into code. But then the code is also very poorly written. None of the code is written to explain the concept.It feels more like the author cut pasted it from somewhere else.Some of the concepts - like relationships and roles - leave one wondering with the question, whether the author himself has understood them properly."
4,The Food Revolution,"This is a great book. As a future dietetic professional, it is important to keep up on the books consumers are purchasing. Even though at times, John Robbins can make meat eaters feel very guilty, the book is excellent."
5,The Vegan Bible!,"John Robbins has created a masterpiece! This work is simply the best compilation of writings that I have read on health, nutrition, and animal rights issues. In the ten years that I have tried to live a vegan lifestyle I have never read a more complete or compelling account dealing with this subject matter.Prior to finding this book, I was searching for new reading material to reinforce my belief in the vegan / vegetarian diet. This book not only reinforced my personal beliefs but also rejuvenated my desire to educate others on these matters. I can't thank Mr. Robbins enough for all of the efforts that he has made to improve our world and ourselves!I consider this book to be an invaluable resource. It is the one book that I recommend to my coworkers and friends. I consider it the vegan bible!"
5,Eye opening!,I thought I knew a lot about where our food comes from... Aparently I didn't know the half of it! This book is absolutely amazing! I wish stuff like this was mandatory reading instead of the garbage they let kids read now days.
5,Riveting and Compelling,"If this book doesn't make you want to go vegan, nothing will! Help save the Earth, prolong your life and go veg!"
2,Not for the casual reader,"Bought this for my son who has become a vegetarian and wants me to be one also. I told him to get a book on ""how to be a vegetarian"" with meals etc. NOT! Boring, he said. I was lost the first chapter. Not for me."
1,Sure The Argument are Great.,"Yes any vegitarian can come up with great arguments as to why we should not eat meat,this book is no different. My reply to all people who have the ability to pick their diet is, meat eaters as well, ""Don't you feel great that we live in a country that has a cornicopia of food, that we even have the ability to chose what we can and cannot eat?"" I have been to many places in the world twhere food is very scarce. Because of who was governing their country, nothing else, was the reason there was no food. The Leaders of the country kept the food away from the masses, this is done as a way to controle the masses. Oh yes, how come a lot of the vegeterians I know smoke (which is way worse than meat} tell people to be vegeterians. Are they vegetarians because it's cool. Smoking is also cool(sarcasm).My main point is that we in the US can pick any type of diet we want, we should be thankful for that."
5,Save the Planet and Love yourself...,"I read John Robbin's book, 'Diet for a New America' before I read 'The Food Revolution' and I wish I had just read this! It's similar, but more of the whole package. It discusses vegetarianism in all aspects unlike, 'Diet for a New America.' All in all, probably the most informative book on vegetarianism I have read.Also recommended: 'The China Study' by T. Colin Campbell, 'Eat to Live' by Joel Fuhrman, 'Mad Cowboy' Howard Lyman. And Robbin's other book, 'Healthy at 100' is fantastic!"
5,The Food Revolution,"If this book doesn't change you into a vegetarian and swear you off of eating at the fast food chains, nothing will. John Robbin's is a hero in the true sense of the word. He could have lived the life of luxury having been born into the Baskin Robbins empire of ice cream but chose a live a life closer to his own true values. The book is divided into four parts. The first part covers how meat and dairy products affect your health, the second part covers the the abuse of animals by farm factories especially those run by the fast food chains, the third part covers how eating meat and dairy affects the environment and world hunger, and the fourth part discusses genetically engineered foods. This book is a must read for anyone who cares about their health, animals, and the environment."
5,Life Changing,"This is one of those books that changed my life so much that I feel bad for people who have not read it.This book will remain, for all time, the best $10 I have EVER spent."
4,Compelling and riveting read...,"I bought this book and am not even entirely done with reading it but I'm going to post a review anyway. It's a good read. Robbins lays out compelling, research-backed positions, and clearly states the benefits of changing what you eat for a better life. I've already lost 7 pounds and while I miss meat, I'm finding that I actually can live without it as a major component of my diet!"
1,I wish that I could get my money back,"I watched George Canyon on Nashville Stars. I liked his voice and some of the songs that he did on the show. I bought this cd with hopes of hearing more good sounds from him. I was very disappointed. Mr. Canyon can not compete with the Brad Cotter's and Rascal Flatts of the world. If he wants to make it in the country business, he needs to go back to country. Take the acoustic guitars, electric guitars and ""please the little girls"" songs and run over them with his truck. Get a steel guitar and a fiddle and write some cheating, hurting, drinking songs. If he wants to be a pop star...he'll flop. If he wants to be a country star, he needs to sit down and listen to Mark Chesnutt's new cd, ""Savin' the Honky Tonks"", go get a bottle of booze and start writing. I like the voice...just not the contents of this cd.If you go TRUE COUNTRY, you may not get as much air play, but the true country fans will find you and appreciate you."
5,Perfect Canyon cd!,I bought George Canyon cd One Good Friend. I just fell in love with it. His songs are great they all have a story in them. I have bought this cd for Christmas gifts. I can't get enough of this One Good Friend cd by George Canyon. Please if you don't have this cd go and get it. You will love it and it has something for everyone.
2,Melts in the bag not in your hands...,This item arrived melted. The recipient was disappointed by this.It was one of the few times i had ordered something for someone and was not satisfied by the condition it arrived in.
5,m&m peanuts candy,great product arrived on time was what was advertised and how can ylou go wrong with m&ms; yaaaaay they work great in my new gum ball machine i bought on amazonsweet tootht ;)
2,chocolate and summer,stupid me I ordered chocolate during the summer months! The bag that I ordered came with most of the M&Ms; melted and reformed. Maybe Amazon could put a hold on selling chocolate during this time of year like the Vermont Country Store does. But I guess that would put a crimp in thier profits.We ate them anyway but didnt enjoy them as much. Will not do it again.
1,Crushed peanuts,"I love peanut M&M's and buy it all the time. I thought that I could just buy a big bag so I didn't run out but it was not worth it. It's more expensive (and I don't have to pay for shipping b/c I'm Prime), which is okay with b/c it's hard for me to get to the store and I wanted it fast. The 1 star rating is b/c 25% of the candy came crushed and left a mess when I opened the bag. I think that there were melting issues and with the weight, some pieces just cracked. I will not buy again."
2,Cheaper elsewhere,Don't buy it here. You can get this bag at BJs Wholesale Club or Sams Club for $7 or $8 and not have to pay shipping.
2,Item not as described!,"I ordered this 56 ounce bag of M&Ms, but what I received was a box of 3.27 ounce bags. I don't like being misled when purchasing things online."
5,Algae Zapper !!!,"This is an excellent unit in keeping my pond clear of algae! My little (100 gallons) outdoor pond was over grown with algae. I have to clean it at least once a week to keep the algae under control. The constant cleaning had stressed out my little koi (3"" long) and none of them survived beyond 6 weeks. After adding this unit to my pond, the algae problem disappeared! My pond is clear and I can see the bottom of the pond! Also, my water lilies and my new gold fishes are alive and well.One small recommendation, keep the unit on at all time (like the instruction said)! After running it for three consecutive weeks, I turned it off and tried to see if the algae problem returned. With the unit off, the algae came back with a vengence. In less than 4 days, my water lilies and the pond wall are full of algae again!"
4,New Slants,G. Himmelfarb has some very different insights into the authors she discusses and puts some of the characters in the novels in new lights. I have enjoyed reading this book and she has prodded me into reading further in the authors discussed. I would recommend this book to any persons interested in changing the 'moral tone' of American today.
4,Debussy Faure and Ravel Trios,"While tempermentally cooler than the Beaux Arts or Eroica Trio in comparison, The Florestan Trio gives beautifully shaped and paced performances.And how splendid the DSD/SACD sound is for chamber music!"
5,Programming Expert Systems in Pascal by Sawyer,"The knowledge base formulation is explained in this text.The data is drawn from humans, texts, researchers and a host ofcritical constituencies. The inference engine commenceswhenever a human inquires. It compares the user inquiry to theknowledge base, seeks causal relations and evaluates therelative certainty of facts. The user interface exchanges databetween the operator and the inference engine. Planning foran expert system commences with the following:o specification of objectives and refinement of themo define problems and subproblemso develop controls and measureso knowledge engineeringo selection of expertso extraction of pertinent knowledgeo optimize the knowledge baseo implement, test and refine the methodology"
4,Long lasting,"I've used and had these shears for the past few years. Used them sparingly once every 2-3 months. Come in a small, thin plastic case. Tension adjuster works fine. Nothing is really exceptional but can't say anything bad about them either, since the blades are still sharp enough."
1,"Entertainment, not for learning about business","This book is fluff. Hint: There's a review of the book from Maxim Magazine (great mag, but not for business) on the back cover. Book formula is ""Here's this concept. Let's spend about two pages on it, and then about two pages on an real-world example. There isn't enough time spent on the concept, or the real-world example.I picked this book up at the airport for something to read on a short trip, without checking out any Amazon reviews on it. Learn from my mistake - do yourself a favor, pass over this book."
2,Not worth it,"I think this blade lacks endurance and defense. When it attacks, its powerful. But if its being attacked, its over."
3,"It's Pretty Good, But It Needed A Little More","Why I Kinda Like ARGON ZARK! by Chris CrosbyARGON ZARK!, overall, was an entertaining read. There was a lot of adventure and excitement packed into it, and the artwork was very colorful and pleasing to the eye. However, after reading it, I felt a little empty. I recommend ARGON ZARK!, but I would have liked to see more realistic character interaction, and more insight into the futuristic world Argon lives in. Still, it's worth a read. THE END."
5,Argon Goes Offline! Get the Latest on The Badnasty Crash!,"It's not every day that you find a printed version of an online comic; usually it's the other way around. But in this case, the print shines as much as the pixels. Charley Parker's ""Argon Zark"" (along with his courier girlfriend Zeta Fairlight and his ""personal digital assistant"" Cybert) romps through the pages in such a way that you almost forget that you're not reading it on your laptop. As Dilbert is to disillusioned engineers and programmers, Argon is to web surfers and Internet chatgroup and newsgroup lurkers. We knew all along the Internet was huge, twisted, and chaotic, but this is why it's FUN."
1,Color rubs off on counters,I have had to throw all of these away. The color rubs off on the counter tops....
2,Silicon backing comes off on EVERYTHING!!,"I loved these at first, but now they get the colored backing on everything they touch. It's ridiculous that I have to spend like 10 minutes scrubbing the coloring off of my counters after I have used these. Spend a little more and get something else."
3,They aren't bad but...,"I bought these cutting boards about six months ago and initially they worked great! But then after time, the colored silicone began to rub off on my white countertops! Not cool! Then after I put them away, I now have to spend 10 min getting my countertops back to white. Huge pain!"
2,designs wash or rub off...,"I have had these cutting boards for nearly six months, and they have become basically unusable. The colored designs on the back of these leave marks all over my counters. Not to mention, when I wash them they leave marks on my hands and sponges. :("
1,Design comes off,"I would not recommend these....the skid proof design on the bottom wears off! I hand washed mine, I can't imagine what would happen in the dishwasher! The ""paint"" or whatever it is become sticky/tacky for some reason and ends up on your counter tops. Granted these aren't expensive, but I still expect some quality!"
2,Printed design comes off!,I've had these mats for about 9 months and their colored designs are rubbing off - they leave traces of silicone all over my counter.
2,Great Idea...but doesn't quite work,"I love the idea behind these cutting boards, color coding for different types of foods. My complaint is the same as other reviewers, the color rubs off on anything it gets put up against. I'm constantly rewashing these because the color from one has transferred to the cutting surface of another. I'm now looking for a replacement for these.PROS: good cutting surface, nice thicknessCONS: color rubs off on everthing, not dishwasher safe"
1,picto cutting boards,These are a no go. The non skid and color is sticking to our counter and is not coming off.
2,Designs melt and peel,"My wife and I were both very excited to see cutting boards that were color-coded and designed to avoid cross-contamination, but after a couple of weeks of using these boards we are planning on tossing them and replacing them with solid colored boards. The problem is, as other folks have mentioned, that the colored stripes and the graphic in the center peel off the back and leave a mess on your hands, your counters and your sink. The mess is simply not worth it. I will probably buy some solid colored plastic cutting boards and remind myself which color goes with what produce."
2,Too Big,"No chance this will fit on a ""normal"" sized head. My mom has a huge head and it was still too big on her!"
4,"Soft, but too big.","This is very soft, which is what I was looking for. It is also a little stretchy vs. adjustable, which I'd hoped would make it a good purchase. Unfortunately, it is too big even before it stretches."
1,www.amazon.com,"I bought four colors are orange and black and blue Maronite access to me on time, but the blue was not with them, the most the best color to use"
4,super soft headbands,"We purchased these same headbands about two or three years ago. Our local sports boosters had them monogrammed in our team's colors with our logo, name, etc. and sold them for a money-making project. They were a big hit and we're doing the same with this year's order. Very comfortable and warm."
2,"New Perspectives Series, Microsoft FrontPage2000","I purchased this book and already have experince with HTML coding, which I had learned using another book by New Perspectives that was very helpful. But personaly I found this book more of a thrown together at the last minute to publish book. The tutorils are in most cases helpful, yet in some sections the book will have you do the same type of exercise that has no reasoning or explanation and never works correctly, and I was not alone. Friends tried the same tutorals and found the same problem. My sugestion is wate for a Second addition to come out."
1,Quit working in just two weeks!,"I can't believe it. I just bought it. I am generally astonished that this can even be sold legally. It didn't even last me a month. It worked okay until yesterday, and now it won't read discs, won't finish recording anything, and generally refuses to work. I just had a ""video now"" recorder, and it worked for about six months, and slowly stopped working. It was a gift, so I figured I had lost nothing, and I went ahead and purchased another dvd recorder. Bad idea. After reading hundreds of reviews and websites, I have discovered that it is best to purchase a panasonic dvd recorder if you expect it to last. Unfortunately I have already lost my money on this one, and have been left with a sour taste for dvd recorders."
1,Piece of Junk,"This is the biggest piece of junk I have bought in a long time. First, it only accepts and reads about 50% of the dvds I put in for recording. Yet the dvds read fine in other dvrs. I bought this to record videos onto dvds. 1/2 way though, approximately 10 videos, the screen started showing that it was recording in black and white. I assumed the the video player was on it last legs......wrong the dvd recorder is now recording in black and white.Another thing I don't like is it does not give you thumbnails, which most other dvrs do. It gives you chapters (my mistake I assumed chapers and thumbnails are the same) They are not.I would not recommend this for anyone. I will now buy a name brand, such as Sony. Remember you get what you pay for."
1,Poor performance,"I've had great luck with other lite-on products for the computer, but I believe the quality of their products have slipped after using this dvd recorder. From the beginning I've experienced intermittent poor sound quality in recording. I chose to ignore it, since sending the product back was more trouble than it was worth (low cost of product). In a little over a year the video stops or is constantly breaking up. I know one unit doesn't necessarily dictate quality, but read some of the other reviews. I don't think mine is unique."
1,Great IF IT WORKED,"I've now recieved 3 different 5005's from Amazon. Each one has had a defect. Unit 1 was unable to record to ANY disk, even the one included with the unit. Unit 2 would not record to DVD-RW disks, again, not even the one included with the unit. I also bought several on their ""apprved"" disk list. No go. Unit 3 seemed to work perfectly! Now I see that the TV tuner does not work (I hadn't set it up before as I am not really using it to record off air)! Each time, Lite-on Tech support was great - ""Just return it to the store where you bought it"". Thanks alot. I don't see how I can get 3 bad units, unless thier quality control is non existant. Too bad, as this is the only unit I've found that has all the specs I require: all format recordng including audio formats. Avoid this unit if you can, otherwse buy locally so you exchange more easily. When it works though, it does what it's supposed to do."
3,Lite-On DVD Recorder,"I am really happy with this product as a DVD player-it will play all types of DVD types as advertised, however, the recording has much to be desired. It places a buzz/hum on your recorded programs/DVD's so that you can't hear what you have recorded, it's really annoying and I just stopped recording with this product and am using at as an expensive DVD player right now. I will definitely research any more products from this company better because the main reason I bought it was for the recording capacity and now I can' use it. I guess you get what you pay for though, this was the cheapest DVD recorder out there."
2,Could last a little longer,this dvd recorder is very easy to use.I took it right out of the box and hooked it right up and recorded 2 movies in 1 night.Then after a month it stopped reading any of my dvd's.It would read my cdr's.I called tech support and was told I would be given a brand new unit.I sent mine back and got a refurbish unit.I called them and said I wanted a brand new unit.They argued with me and the one guy actually hung up on me.You can't get anyone to speak right.I could hardly understand them.They treated me really bad on the phone.After argueing with them for 2 hours they finally agreed to send me a brand new unit.That one lasted 3 months and quit working on me.The exact same thing.it stopped reading my dvd's and stopped recording my dvds.If you want a good dvd recorder stick with a panasonic or a good old Sony.Worth the extra money.
2,Great features but TV tuner stinks!,I have had two units and but tuners look grainy and washed out. The unit is easy to setup and very easy to record with but use and external tuner or great for recording from camcorders.
1,No wonder it's so Cheap!,"I purchased this product about 18 months ago , like several others of you. And all the sudden it has stopped working. I had noticed that some of my recorded shows were not coming out with sound but thought it was just the player. I went out and bought another player. Same problem. Now I have no picture on my TV. This unit had been professionally installed. I know it was done correctly. Now I have to go out and purchase a new recorder. So don't think you are getting a good deal with this unit. Your deal is only going to last a year! And then it will cost you more in the long run. I have e-mailed cutomer support and will report back with the outcome of my e-mail. Until then I suggest spending the extra $50.00 bucks for a good unit."
1,lvc 5005,"The unit worked for no more than 6 months, LITEON customer service refused to repair the unit even though it is still under warranty. Liton would only offer a refurbed lvc 5115ghc+ in swap for the more expensive and capable 5005. After 8 NOT toll free calls, their 800 # tells you to call a 510 # where you wait on hold at lease 15 minutes.The supervisors will not call you back after you leave a message with the first line telephone answerers if you call multi times like me and insist you are asked exactly what you want and will agree to in advance as the supervisors do not like to call a customer blind (as they put it)."
4,Good recorder,Bought this unit and a few months later the drive stopped reading any DVD media. It had no problems reading CD media though. A call to liteon tech support resulted in a no questions asked RMA for a replacement. A new unit was returned a week later and everything works great.
3,"Nice Looking, but defective out of the box.","My LVW-5005 was defective from the start. It was noisy and would not read any DVD's. It would try, then give me a 'FAIL' message. I like the styling and features I was able to use. It was easy to hook up. The manual was easy to follow. The setup menus were easy to use. Wish it would have worked. I was looking forward to using it."
1,Agree with D. Cordes,My unit did the same as his. It worked for a few weeks and now it is an expensive DVD player. Doesnt record or even read the blank discs anymore.Stay away from this unit. It is a piece of junk.
2,Easy to use but low quality sound,"I have a 5.1 surround sound system and when I hooked this up, there was a low feedback hum which I was unable to eliminate. In addition the volume was much lower. This was present when recording anything from the TV and it WAS picked up by the recording."
4,LITE-ON LVW-5005 DVD/CD Recorder,"Seller stated item was new but there were scratches indicating usage - maybe not.Only problem is machine fails frequently to read discs(those recommended by mfg.) Keep getting ""No Disc"" error message.Very agravating.Once you get past above, it works great."
1,Don't waste your money,This recorder worked great when it was new but quit recognizingANY discs about the time the warranty ended.I bought another model from LiteOn & it did the same thing!Their recorders only last until the warranty expires. then you haveto replace them.
1,Junk,"We purchased this product for considerably more than the current price of $89.99. It always had a few quirks, but we ignored them. Over the course of about 18 months, the unit became more troublesome. This weekend, it totally died. This unit is in an adult household, and it was never abused. In fact, it really wasn't used much at all. I would never buy a Lite-On product again."
4,Great for the price!,"Unit is very easy to use and records flawlessly so far. It may not have all the bells and whistles of the expensive units, but it meets my needs perfectly. I wanted to be able to record reliably to archive my favorite sci-fi series and this does a great job with a good interface at a great price!"
4,LVW-5005 pretty nice,"We are very pleased with our LVW-5005.Besides recording programs off cable TV, I am also finally transferring all our video camera digital tapes onto DVD+RW's for viewing and eventually editing on a PC. Very nice."
2,Great stand alone unit but don't try to share discs with anyone,"This Liteon unit only records in the VR mode. That means that sharing discs with a standard player that doesn't support the VR mode (like most all players) can NOT play the DVDs produced by this recorder. Aside from that it works great! Very good picture, even at the slow speeds. Controls are easy to work. I called Liteon and the played stupid on why my DVDs I made would not play anywhere else and didn't mention the VR mode issue. Besides not being able to share DVDs with others I was worried that if I transfer my VCR tapes to DVD using this unit and down the road others don't support the VR mode this all my DVDs will be wasted. Buyer beware on this one..."
1,Lose a DVD movie in the Recorder,"Literally after we used the DVD recorder for five days, the machine inexplicably broke. We placed one of our DVD movies into it, but the device could not advance past ""Hello."" Trying to get the recorder to eject the DVD also proved futile. It remained lodged in the machine. I called customer service asking for the authorized repair center in order to retrieve the DVD only to discover that no such repair center existed within my state. In the end, we had to send the recorder back to the retailer and our DVD movie was lost forever. There was no compensation for our DVD. My suggestion to the consumers of this device: if you insert one of your favorite movies into the machine, be prepared to never see it again."
1,Exoperience with LVW 5005,"I bought this item and it had recording problems from the start. Negotiations with LiteOn support was most unsatisfactory (I think they have difficulty with the English language)but, eventually, they agreed I had a defective product and exchanged it. The new one worked well for a time but now it is giving problems in recording. Again, I have difficulties with their support. They do not answer the questions I ask. It seems they have little interest in supporting the customer. My ultimate belief is that they have marketed a product which has not been developed fully and is fraught with problems and the consumer pays for this. I would advise everyone not to buy LiteOn products."
1,No options: their way or the highway! That's unacceptable!,I bought the unit because it had pretty good reviews. Unfortunately once I received it I was very disappointed because everything has to be done their way. It is impossible to record a DVD without a menu. How stupid is that!!! I just want to create a DVD with one title and one chapter that automatically starts playing when you put it in a DVD player. Unfortunately that is impossible. I returned the unit since in my opinion the lack of options is unacceptable.
1,Liteon 5005 DVD recorder,"Within the last day or two, my LITEON 5005 can no longer recognize any rewriteable DVD+RW disk I put in it. It attempts to read it, but always comes back with either a 'FAIL' or an INVALID DISK message. As i only use this player/recorder in the living room (I have a comcast DVR on the main TV), I have not burned on this recorder very often. From the look of other posts, contacting technical support will do no good."
4,Fine low price DVD recorder,"This is my first stand alone DVD recorder and I can find nothing about it that I dislike. It cost little more than a decently rated DVD player so I'm pleased. Time shifting TV recording is intuitive. It has played everything I've loaded into it except a dirty DVD from the library (cleaning the DVD cured that problem). I've been using Lite-On computer hardware for years and the Lite-On name attracted me. They make good computer components and this seems to be just an extension of that. Lite-On is certainly NOT an ""off-brand"" although I didn't know they made consumer electronics.Additional comment added in August, 2011. This unit is still working and incidentally, it is region free."
1,Be Warned!,"Super small remote, not universal, has very small buttons and no volume control. Can not insert images for chapter titles, only uses first screen of recording which is always blank. Very sensitive to brand of blank DVD. Stopped working after 4 months of light use. Stay away from this one and buy a brand name."
1,this thing sucks,"It worked fine at first, but only for about 6 months. I can't use it as a dvd player now. I only used it like 5 times too. It really sucks."
1,Good looks but poor guts,"I bought this really good looking machine, only to have to return it within one week. It records well on DVR Recordables but not on DVD Re-writables."
3,See if you win the lottery.... you very well may!!,"I decided to buy LVW-5005 since my Go-video R6740 died after providing great service to me. Feature and review of LVW-5005 attracted me. I bought one and had problem after little bit of use. I returned and bought second one, it had severe problems. I thought there are many people who say this is great, let me try one more time. I did and it works great so far!!! I have been doing test recording for a week without any issues. Quality is excellent too. It seems you have to be lucky to get hands on good piece... it is a lottery worth winning for the price you pay. Hope this helps. I have put 3 stars since I had to try 3 times to get to good piece of product."
4,Trouble shooting,"this is a useful guide for someone who already has a good knowledge of PC's and how they function. Without some background it will be hard to follow the charts. Useful tool for someone who works on family, friends PC's."
3,Useful enough,Not very detailed but is useful for general trouble shooting. Flow charts are a bit too simple for comlex problems.
4,Gave as a Gift,"Gave this as a gift to my grandson and haven't really heard any negative feedback, so I guess it's okay."
5,Great computer repair!,"Handy flowcharts with accompaning detailed descriptions. Very logically organized and layed out. It provides you with a structured process for tracking down pc problems. Highly recommended.Having a little troubleshooting experience would be helpful, but not absolutely necessary. A fair number of pc problems have very simple solutions. The author does not overlook the obvious(is it plugged in? are all the mute buttons unchecked?) on way to making a proper diagnosis.If you are at all serious about providing your own tech support (or support to friends and family), get this book. Money well spent."
3,"Not complete, but still handy","This book is very short, and it often states the obvious. It is far from complete, but it's still a handy thing to have around and much more portable than a big O'reilly's book.The good thing about it is that it's so damn easy to read. You can follow the flow chart to go straight to the advice you're looking for. I just wish it was longer and offered more solutions than it does."
4,Good book for beginners,"This is not a book about hardware; simply it gives you many flowcharts to guide you in the process to isolate a hardware failure.If you are looking for a book to learn ""how a PC works""; this book is not for you; but if you want to repair a PC, it`s a good choice."
4,It's a great tool,"I built a computer for the first time last year. When I had a problem with it, I was unsure how to troubleshoot the issue. This book was simple to follow and helped me learn a lot and determine the cause for my problem."
4,It's not really a book...,"Well when I got this product I was expecting it to be more like an actual book. To my suprise it resembles a workbook more than an actual book. It is the typical 8 1/2 by 11 size but it's MAYBE half a centimeter thick. However, other than that it does have some good information in it and for each flowchart it has about 5 pages or so of written explainations of different parts of the flowcharts which I thought was helpful."
5,computer repair,"It's always good to have a reference book when dealing with computer problems. If not this book,a similar book would do just as well."
4,Smooch with the one you love,Morcheeba is the ultimate cool pad music when you're with a loved one late at night. Slip this album on and light a few candles and let it work it's magic. Fantastic...
4,No Cheeba Needed - This Disk Already Smokes,"The only reason I gave 4, instead of 5, stars for this fantastic album is that the sound quality of this recording is not on a par with ""Big Calm."" However, the music more than compensates for this technical snafu. Unlike ""Big Calm,"" The lyrics and tones in ""Who Can You Trust"" have a nice edge in them. As fanatastic as they sound on disk...you MUST see them in concert. I can't wait for the third album and another concert tour."
3,Solid trip hop,"Morcheeba's first effort is their strongest. Skye's voice is hypnotic, laid back, and beautiful. The hooks are strong, the arrangements and production, while not ground-breaking, are very solid and nuanced.If you like the chill, smoky sound of trip hop, you really can't go wrong here. However, there are better groups than Morcheeba - check out Massive Attack's cds, Portishead, the K&D; sessions from Kruder and Dorfmeister, and maybe even some Theivery Corporation. None of these cds have Skye, of course, but I find these artists more interesting - all of them get more time in my cd player than Morcheeba.WARNING: avoid Morcheeba's third cd ""Fragments of Freedom"" at all cost!!!"
4,good music to chill to,I found out about this album on line and I must say I am very glad I am. Trigger Hippy is just a great song. This is a good CD to put in and relax. Nice bass lines and vocals.
4,"A very strong, rootsy trip-hop disc","Who Can You trust is Morcheeba's first major effort and it's a strong one. Standout tracks for me include ""Trigger Hippie"" and ""Tape Loop,"" which both should be part of any right-thinking trip-hop mix. The first two-thirds of the disc move consistently and well, giving way to a quiet and gloomy atmosphere in the latter part of the album. This disc and Big Calm both make me think of the old early 70's soul albums and of early, early Funkadelic. This Manchester band was a big part of the extraordinary flowering of musical talent out of that city in the nineties. This disc and Big Calm are the two essential CDs to get by this band."
4,"Sit back, relax","I think, the ""Big Calm"" is the best, what Morcheeba got out so far. But the ""Who can u trust"" is the first thing i heard from this band and so i get in touch to this kind of music. Of courseMassive Attack, Portishead etc. is one step more well known, but i wouldnt say they`re better. The voice of Skye is inimitable, so are the others. Thats why i dont like to rate these bands. They brought me hours of enjoyment and thats most important. I also can recommend PJ Harvey. (xcuse my english)."
3,Dissapointing after listening to Big Calm,This CD is not nearly as good as Big Calm. I got this and the B-Sides and it's lacking in the seductive nature that Big Calm has going for it. The beats are slower and not as captivating.
3,Not bad but quite bland .,"I can't understand all the fuss about this album . I was expecting it to be an innovative trip-hop record but found it to be a rather pleasantly tame ( dare I say bland ) listening experience . Most of the tracks have no depth or substance to them , and I have the feeling that here is a band that is living on musical cliches because it hasn't got the innovative talent to really produce a groundbreaking record .A rather pleasant , forgettable record ."
2,You should proably avoid this one.,"If ""Big Calm"" hooked you on Morcheeba, you are probably interested in some of their other recordings. Avoid this one. Many of the tracks sound similar to ""Big Calm"" tracks, but the production values are lower and the singing isn't as sensuous. You'll be disappointed."
1,Waste of Plastic,"Laughable lyrics, music just slightly better, the only thing this band has going for it is the singer's voice."
3,"quite good , very calm (no cacho na )","these album is quite good , not amazing as i thougth but i liked it . andrew pesse"
4,Great stuff,I liked this one better than Big Calm. Maybe because I heard it first or maybe because when I was dating my husband we made out to it a lot! :) They are a great band and I'm looking forward to more.
3,Used to love it,"What can I say? I haven't listened to this or Big Calm for some time, but, with Charango coming out I figured I'd give them both a spin. What a disapointment! I used to love both , but, is it possible for an album that is not even ten years old to sound dated? If you say no I present this album as evidence to the contrary"
4,Love the product,While I have been using this product for several years now. I would never buy another kind of wax kit. However I will never order this product from amazon ever again. When the package got here it was in shreds the box that would normally contain the products was in little pieces. The package was also dirty like it had been stepped on. It is a lucky thing that none of the products inside were damaged. I am just disappointed in the seller.
1,Here is another dead one,"Don't buy a Kogi....Just to echo all of the others, poor picture, poor quality control. Mine died just over the year period as well.....It looks like the backlight went out, but turned out to be a video processing board...Look elsewhere."
1,Short Life Span LCD Monitor,"The L4AX 14 inch LCD monitor from KOGI ran for just over a year then quit. The new GVision repair facility in Lake Forest, CA (949) 586-3338 wanted $45.00 just to look at it, then would add the cost of any parts needed. From the other reviews, these monitors suffer from short life spans and probable non-existent quality control checks at the factory. Suggest readers buy a well-known brand of LCD monitor, one that has been around for several years like Princeton, for example."
1,Another Cheap Generic Chinese product,"Granted that everything electronic is made in China these days, but there are products that go through quality checks and those that are cheapos w/ no quality check.my kogi 14"" just died after 13 months. it was cheap cheap cheap. no contrast to speak of, difficult to get it to display a crisp image, i ran into almost all of the problems listed in Kogi's Tech FAQs (except for dead pixels).This is a clearly a product of a third rate factory in China that have no product quality standards and just crank them out to make a buck to sell to cheap customers (like me) or ones that don't know better, in the developed nations.Do not buy from Kogi or GVision (their manufacturer). I have learned my lesson as a cheap skate, I would rather get a CRT monitor than a cheap LCD!"
4,Low cost Space saving,"My monitor was acting very strange this morning after 8 months of working fine. I quickly and easily found the Kogi web site and there found an answer to my problem (a split screen and strange dots) and easily fixed it. This monitor is located in a kids' room where there is little space and lots of abuse. So small and cheap is perfect for me and that's what this monitor is. So far the thing has held up, even with the problem this morning. I paid surprising little for this monitor at Amazon with a rebate and I'm happy with it as of today. I'm kind of surprised the other reviews are so negative."
1,Don't do it,This is a bad product. It will not last. Those that have it working for longer than 10 months are more the exception rather than the rule. You get what you pay for!
3,Early problems apparently worked out...,Purchased this product. Two months later it stopped working. Tried everything. Took quite some time to diagnose that the problem was in fact the monitor. I was getting ready to ship to Kogi to get it fixed when I decided that I'd give it one more try. It now works again so I've bumped my rating up from 1 to 3 Stars.
1,Fuzzy,"The price might seem right, but this thing is pretty bad. I checked out one at the local Best Buy and it was terrible. Sitting right next to it was a NEC and Viewsonic and they made it look like dirt.Just to be certain it wasn't a dud, I looked at another store where they had three different models: some worse than others but all pretty bad. If you really think this is what you want you had better go take a look at it first.I honestly think you would be better off with the cheapest, Nec, Viewsonic, Sony, Samsung, or Planar display you could find."
5,AMAZON should think twice to do business with this company,I bought this Monitor because AMAZON advertised the Monitor for $ 209.00 PLUS $ 70.00 Mail-in-Rebate. I send in what they asked for but my Rebate is reclined because I don't have a ORIGINAL Invoice from AMAZON. The Monitor was delivered from the Manufactor so I only have a computer-printed Invoice from AMAZON. They will not accept the Invoice. We gave this matter to the General-Attorney from AZ because is it not right. We saw on TV a few days ago this happened all the time with Mail-in-Rebate for Computer-Equipment's.
1,Do NOT buy this thing!,"I do not care if you get this monitor free after rebate, it is not worth it. Check out KOGi Tech. Support pages. FAQ #6 is about this little peice of work. The screen splits into 4 parts and swaps positions with the part on it's oppisite side. I had gone through 2 of these before I looked at their site to find out that their solution was to unplug the power from the monitor without powering it down when the screen splits. No real solution like send it in and we will fix it. If you do not mind unplugging your monitor all the time, go for it. There is a certain place that thinks they are the BEST place to BUY things that has it for $149.00 after rebate. Pretty cheap to enter the world of LCD but is it worth the troubles? You decide."
2,I don't know about buying this monitor....,"My family recently purchased this monitor for the home computer. Since the price was at around $200 it seemed like a great deal. The only problem is that the monitor is made very slap-dash and cheap. While the monitor worked as expected for quite a while; after about 6 months, the screen went completely dim (barely able to see anything on the screen). Fortunately, there happens to be a LIMITED warranty on the LCD monitor, but who really wants to deal with the hassle of shipping a large item out of pocket for it to get serviced. If the montior did not fail so soon, it would have been an excellent purchase. Therefore, be careful buying this model from KOGI because it might break and cause a lot of inconvenience."
1,Don't buy this item!,"I bought the monitor as a gift and it failed within the 90 day warranty period. I tried the phone number on the warranty card and it is non-working. The fax number worked, so I sent them all the information and no word! So I certified mailed them notice and still no word - not eve the certified card has come back. Amazon should takes this product off its site! I would give it even one star (but its required)."
1,"bad kogi, no picture","We bought this item about 14 months ago, and it just died. We were concerned from the start because the company stiffed us (...). When I called them for service, I found that it was more expensive to repair than to replace. They were unresponsive to my complaint that it was only 14 months old and pretty much told me to go fish. That's what I'll do- fish for a new monitor from a company I've heard of!"
1,Don't even think about it!,"Hello everyone,I've just received this monitor, about an hour ago, and I am returning it back to Amazon.com! It is the worst monitor I have ever seen in my whole life. The left side of the monitor was totally blured, and the screen started to shake, rock and roll baby! The price after rebate was about $100, but believe me, it is not worse a $1! Anyways, it might be my luck, but I ignored others' review before I buy this and now I ahve to return it, which is a pain! Good luck..."
1,2 repairs in 1 month!,"This monitor is the worst mistake I have ever made! After I have purchased on Amazon.com it hasn't been working for a 10 single minutes. It's been in the maunfacturer's repair 2 times already. As soon, as it will get broken the third time, I will get my money back from my vredit card."
4,"Nice monitor, even better price after rebate","I bought this monitor a few months ago. I can't I can beat the price on it. Yes it is only 14.1"" It replaced my 15""CRT monitor that was only 13.9"" viewable so it was still an upgrade. The only thing I can say is that it isn't really as bright as other flat panel monitors. But for the price after rebate it is a steal. The silver and black is really sharp looking."
2,Personally not a big fan of the apple,I am a big fan of gonesh so I gave this one a try and overall it just didn't do it for me.
3,ffairly good,"Overall I am quite pleased. There's only 2 things I'm not too happy about, by its not a big enough deal to send back. I ordered the line with a stud chain and received the one without. And, the description claims 35', and the tag on the package itself claims 25'. But, its no big deal to me to have a separate stud chain, and the overall quality is fine for every day use. Not a bad deal, I just ask the person who packages orders, or the person who writes the descriptions, to be more conscientious. :-)"
5,"Sexy, Romantic, Wonderful","Why read fiction when real life is so wonderful? I enjoyed this book and Early Embraces. These true stories of women falling in love with ""the one"" are more romantic, erotic and entertaining than any fiction I've read so far."
4,Nice companion book to Early Embraces,"I so enjoyed Lindsey Elder's first anthology Early Embraces I was curious to see if her next collection was as good. It was. I was particularly happy to read another short story by Rita Schiano (I LOVED her book Sweet Bitter Love!) and I thought the She Said, She Said section was clever."
2,The Cover is the best part,"I found this book to be boring and predictable. The stories all seem to have the same flow: I meet her and we are together. I understand the importance of short stories, however, they should at least have some substance."
2,LONG TERM...I THINK NOT!,"DISSAPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST....BOOK CONSIDERSMONTHS 'LONG TERM'POOR WRITING, TRITE,BORING"
5,short review,"Exellent Si-Fi Book Sure to capture the readers imagination.Even Thogh it takes place 100 years ago,and man has a better understanding of our solar system and space travel,It still gives us a fear of what we lack in technolgy could be the death of us."
5,great transaction,there was not a problem at all with the way my transaction was handled . I am very pleased
3,Pink Fairies - 'What A Bunch Of Sweeties' (Polydor),"One factor about this CD reissue that most Pink Fairies fans WOULD agree on is that it isn't as good as 'Never Never Land' or 'Kings Of Oblivion'.Still,it's not a bad choice,being originally released in 1972,'What A Bunch...' was the Fairies second longplayer.Contains some silliness,but the tracks that I thought pretty much carried their own weight are ""Right On,Fight On"" and ""I Went Up,I Went Down"".Plus,they do a nine-minute cover of The Venture's ""Walk Don't Run"" rather well.Twink had already left the band by the time 'What A...' was recorded,so through out MOST of the lp,there's strictly the trio of Hunter/Rudolph/Sanderson.Decent UK heavy psych.Comes with two bonus cuts and a VERY nice booklet packed with exclusive liner notes,artwork and photos."
4,the pigs of uranus,"the pink fairies the ungerground band who went mainstream with their debut ""kings of oblivion"" and now this album ""what a bunch of sweeties"" better than the half decent debut and much better than the over-long next album ""never-neverland""this in fact is their only album you need yeah the songs may be a tad bit to long yeah they should of been edited by about 3 minutes on the 8 minutes song, but the musicanship is there this band could surely rock...the drumming is powerful strong and steadythe vocals are murky yet appealingand the guitars and bass are sticky like glueyeah the lyrics may sound naive but this was the early seventies don't forgot..but anyway a great album from the pink fairies if you want a good album by the fairies this is the only one you need"
1,Bad customer service!,"I ordered this hat for my husband. It took really long to be delivered. It looked like it had been squashed & didn't look great on. I called to ask about returning & asked if they would pay the shipping because it wasn't a good qualty hat. The person was really rude & wouldn't give me an answer. He didn't believe me when I said it wasn't a good quality hat. Why would I return a hat that I really wanted & couldn't find anywhere, but online? They ended up refunding the money, but I had to pay the shipping both ways which I think is unfair. I will never order from them again."
4,Nice cap,"This a nice cap for the price. The sizes with the Twins brand cap tend to vary slightly from cap to cap, but they are close. I'm not sure if it's the blue color of this cap, but it has more of a denim look than I would have expected. It's still a very nice cap especially when compared to the virtually identical $25-$30 models available at specialty cap stores."
3,Poor Fit,"Love the hat. Same brand in white fit great. This one is too tight. Good quality, just watch for inaccurate size."
5,"Keyboard Genius From San Jose, CA","Musicians around San Jose, California and the greater San Francisco Bay area have for many years been inspired by the playing, writing and singing of Clifford Coulter. Originally a Hammond B3 player, Coulter moved to electric piano and synths in the 1970's and developed an amazing ability on the pitch control level that has to be heard to be believed. Coulter recorded 3 albums during his career, two of which are not available on CD. I highly recommend this album for its strong writing and the keyboard solos which are outstanding. Playing this good never gets dated!"
5,Nice unit,"Nice, small, handy, well made unit that works as it should. Just right for around the home and farm."
1,Two different photos,Is this a scam? Bait and switch? The three photos include the old fashioned version and the new version with bumpers. There is a review here dated October 2012 where the older version was shipped.I have the older version Innova 3310 and it's been a great performer with very long battery life. But someone should wake up the people that listed this one with wrong photos.David
2,Not quite what was pictures on main image.,Little disappointed the product shipped didn't have the bumpers and stand in the back that the main image version has. Have not used the product really yet... will follow up.
1,"The day it arrived, I tested it against another meter...","I needed a meter, but it's only for hobby use. I decided to go with something more reasonably priced(I guess that was my mistake, but it seems like others have had good luck, so far).The first thing I did was open the meter to replace the batteries. As soon as I opened the case, a large ball of solder fell out of the meter. Not a good sign. I looked at the internal components, curious about whether or not it was poorly constructed. I see a transistor that has two leads soldered together, a SMD capacitor that seems to be barely attached, and when I tested the meter, it got vastly different values from changing range on the same 100k resistor.For a 12k resistor, my other meter shows 11.2k. When I measure the same resistor with the 3310, I get .007 for the 2k setting. When I measure the same resistor, I get 0.1 for the 200k setting.So, instead of trying to fix this thing myself, I'm returning it. Guess I'll buy a higher end meter."
3,Good toy to have,Good tester. Wish it was designed with contact needles and clamps to make it easier to grab on things like wires etc
2,resists accurately reading ohms,"Lasted about two weeks before it lost the ability to accurately read ohms. Seems fine in other respects, but I mostly needed it for volts and ohms. I will look elsewhere for my next multimeter."
4,Equus 3310. Nice compact meter,"The meter delivered was not the one on the product ad. Feels solid. Uses 2 AAA, included. Can measure 10A DC. Does not have stand on back. Has an elastic band to hold on to arm. The cables are good quality."
5,Nice little DMM for the home.,"This is a nice little affordable Digital Multimeter optimized for home use. It does not have have some features like autoranging, but does have all the basic functions, plus a couple of nice things most hand held meters don't. The first nice thing is the Battery Load test function which allows you to test common batteries used around the house. The second is the innovative wrist strap that allows one to use both hands when using the test probes. Sweet!The only fly in the ointment here is that you have to take the back off to change the internal battery, but I can live with that.Would I buy it again? Yes, in a heartbeat."
2,WWII History (Father in law quoted),"Purchased 4 of these books to give as gifts... Received only 3 without explanation... delivery was slow and separated... made 2 gifts just in time for Christmas... price not worth the size and info of books a bit too expensive, but wanted to give a memory of my Father-in-law to family so I had no other choice."
2,Big change from previous models...,"I bought many of these shirts in the past. This batch is constructed of an inferior material and construction. No longer recommend these, especially for the price."
3,Ok Light,I needed a light that was not to thick I had a clearance problem with our new screen door and old porch light.Anyway I looked around and these slim lights are hard to find and when you do find one like this they are $150 so I jumped on this for the price.I received my new light but when I took it out of the shipping box the box which had the light in it had a big hole punched in it so I right away knew what was next I took the light out of the box and the whole front was pushed in and the metal frame was broke so it got boxed and shipped like that because the outter shipping box was fine no damage so I sent it back for a refund.About the light itself from what I seen it's a pretty nice light the leading on the glass was poorly done but other than that you would not guess $20 the bulbs would be kinda hard to change as other people mentioned but I was ok with that I wish this would have turned out different but hey I tried
1,You've been warned....,"First of all, this is not a bad album musically. Many of the songs are very straightforward interpretations of Joy Division songs. Some, in fact, sound just like the originals. But that's the problem. As another reviewer posted, it's a Joy Division fanatic being Ian Curtis for a day. But ultimately, it has little or no value in any other Joy Division's fan CD catalog.For me, I love novelty, such as The King's version of LWTUA, or the Nau Ensemble tribute. Because it's different. It's fun, and you don't mind having it making the occasional round on random play. But since these songs are so similar to the originals, you might as well play the originals.I'm as big of a Joy Division fans as they come, but purchasing this CD was, in the end, something I could have done without. You really aren't missing out. You don't need this simply because you're a JD completist."
1,Kind of awful,"got 'transmission' for free and i'm trashing it. it adds nothing to the original. some groups could make it interesting, but this guy didn't. horrible."
1,JD Karaoke,This just sounds like someone doing Karaoke versions of Joy Division songs...the music sounds identical to the originals but the singer is no Ian Curtis and adds nothing of interest to the songs.
4,Great interpretation of Joy Division,"Picture Pat Boone doing Joy Division covers! This album is one man doing what are I guess his favorite Joy Division songs. Not for the serious Joy Division fan, but what covers album is? I like it just for the novelty value."
4,$3.99,"My daughter bought the Pirate Ghost which my granddaughter liked very much at a local book store for $3.99. When I saw The Curse of the Cobweb Queen for $19.95 I assumed it had to be a larger, perhaps longer book of the same series. When the book arrived I was shocked to see it was the same $3.99 book as the Pirate Ghost. If this is supposed to be a rare collectors item why is it not listed as such on the Amazon website? I am dismayed that Amazon cannot or will not recognize that this is a problem."
5,As expected of Charly,"As expected of him, the greatest drummer hits you the second you hear the CD, a tremendous drum solo welcomes you, and takes you to another world. (That is if you are a drummer)Similar to the previous version of this album, Charly, Wolfgang (bass) and Nippy(perc.) are just playing, having fun and we are getting the garments. Great tune from Wolfgang on Arabian Desert Groove.Verdict: If you are not a drummer you should buy this album and listen to become a drummer.If you are a drummer, you should never listen to albums like this since it would bring us down."
2,A Flawed Resource,"Well, what can I say? I was hoping for a lot more based on the price of this CD. The CD contains 3.82 MB of info, that's it. DHTML examples? only 3. CSS examples? Only the product itself. The format is a welcome screen that takes you to 5 different options, which are nothing more than a table of contents. It lists attributes and tags in HTML 4 and CSS level2, with a VERY LIMITED example scope for each attribute.On the plus side: relatively elegant layout. It does tell you what CSS works with what versions of browsers. On the negative side: it doesn't do the same for HTML. Bottom line? A $3.95 2-page reference chart can get you the exact same information cheaper and quicker. Stick to paper-based products."
5,Nice set of trailer tires and wheels,"I ordered a set of these to replace the smaller width OEM tires and wheels on my GatorTrailer for my duck boat and these are first class tires, real wide thick tread should last much longer than a lesser setup. Great upgrade!"
3,mic is not a computer mic,if you want to use it for a computer this is not for you because its in the computer section...its come with a cannon connector with a 6.3 mm plug...it does not come with a standard comp plug which is a 3.5 mm
3,"Pretty to look at, but not alot of substance","I absolutely agree with the review given by Tom Krischan on 1/28/2000. This book is beautiful to look at, with lots of photographs that are well-taken and gorgeously displayed. That's the good part.... Unfortunately there isn't a lot of information in here that even the most basic gardener wouldn't already know from other sources. Bulbs are the primary area of discussion, with houseplants and cuttings from trees and shrubs also being discussed sparingly. It's not the best book for in-depth answers to your other forcing needs. It is nice to look at, though. A definite fixture for aesthetics on my coffee table at home, if nothing else."
3,Nothing special,"I was put off by the book's lack of an index and its casual, meandering approach. The photographs are pleasing, but not awesome. If one is to own only one book on the subject, this would not be the best choice."
3,"Right Size, Not what Pictured","This is not ocean blue, it looks like dark turquoise or perhaps aquamarine, there is too much green in it to be ocean blue. It is not what is pictured. On the other hand, I've never had a SPF 30 shirt before, so maybe there's something to that. It fits and looks great. I'll keep this one but remember not to buy from them again."
3,problem with the order,"Good afternoon,Dear, the packet is sent to an incorrect address Show me the procedure to send the right direction and solve this problem"
2,It was huge!!,"I bought this shirt for my husband to take on a long European vacation. It is lightweight, cool, and has lots of pockets (which he loves). Unfortunately, it was designed by a tentmaker. My husband wears a large in every shirt but THIS large would have fit two of him. It was like an extremely baggy dress. It seemed like a nice shirt but we didn't have time before the trip to return it and try other sizes. I think he would have worn a small and he's not a small man."
3,Nice shirt but stained already,This is a very nice shirt and dries quickly. Runs about one size larger. I give it a 3 star because when received the package had an oil substance all over the inside and somehow stained the shirt. So I received a brand new stained shirt inside the package. I would have like to at least stain it myself in a couple of weeks.
2,Huge Sizes - Too Bad B/C they have Great Color Selection,"Columbia has great clothes but this shirt is designed huge in comparison to other similar shirts (EG LL Bean Tropicware(R) Shirt). Maybe the Columbia designers think Americans who are in the market for their shirts are double portly or want rapper style. Fortunately, LL Bean still designs for athletic people who want a shirt that is loose but not tent like. B/C I have a 38 chest, I wear a Small LL Bean and it fits great. I can't order a size smaller from Columbia b/c there are no sizes smaller than small! Columbia still has better color selection, so if not for the design flaw, I would choose Columbia and it would probably earn 5 stars."
1,Items never arrived,"make the purchase and the delivery date was Nov. 28 and has not yet arrived, the item was shipped by FedEx and according to the tracking number is still in transit, it's been over a month and I hope my articles even as in the same tracking number 5 shirts are similar and sent all together, I can do to get my articles or my money because to date I have no shirts or money, this is the tracking number 9102931502928176834697, I meeting in Venezuela and not to do to make me send my articles."
3,Good product but sized for a bear or whale,"What can I say, excellent quality materials, comfortable, durable, light and functional but what the heck is Columbia thinking. I hope that they principle is due to some functional requirement for fishing for arm movement or something that requires these shirts to be so big, like 2 sizes bigger. I bought an XL as I usually take XL this thing is like a bed spread on me or a table cloth it is super large. I like these shirts so next time I will buy a Medium!"
1,NEVER ARRIVED,"PLEASE CONTACT ME, MY SHIRT NEVER ARRIVED. I am extremely disappointed. It has been 3 weeks. I don't know who to contact but this is not OK."
3,Sizing problem,"The size is 1 size higher than usual. I have purchased from Columbia before but from the Philippines, what I ordered from Amazon seems not to have the same sizing."
4,Great Price & Delivery,"Love the shirt. lightweight and ventilated. The fit was true to size as stated. Delivery was better than originally stated. The quality was ok with several long threads that needed to be trimmed but other than that it looked great right out of the package. The green color is a little ""brighter"" than shown on website but it looks great. Will purchase another (in a different color, or course)."
5,Great Shirt,The Columbia fishing shirt is as good as can be bought. Cool in the summer sun and dries quickly when wet.
4,"Good lightweight shirt, great price, some quality issues","I was looking for a light-weight, quick-drying, sun-protective shirt for my husband for a trip to Africa. The cost of ""safari"" shirts was outrageous. This ""fishing"" shirt had all the advantages at a fraction of the price. The only reason a gave it a 4-star instead of a 5-star is some quality problems. The buttonholes are not completely cut open. I had to pull out my seam ripper and finish cutting them to get the buttons through. It's fixable, it doesn't detract from the shirt after I made the fix, but I would appreciate a little better quality work on the shirt."
4,men's Bahama II short sleeve shirt,This was a Christmas gift and the receiver has given rave reviews. He likes the style and color as well as the fabric which is light and airy--great for warm weather. I think I detect a hint for more of the same in other colors!!
2,Picture was inaccurate,"I bought this shirt because I wanted a white, easy care shirt for traveling but I had to return it. The picture made it look like this is a solid white shirt. However, this is deceiving. Where there are several layers of fabric - like where the pockets are - it is solid white but everywhere else the fabric is so thin that it is you can see through it. This made it look very strange. The shirt itself was fine and other colors buy not have this problem but since I wanted white it didn't work for me."
4,favorite for over 20 years,"prefer the eau de sport after-shave but can't find it any more, this is a bit stronger so just don't use as much & add water"
5,there are just no words.... buy this album now,"i orginally downloaded this album from itunes but it wasn't my first intro to edie carey... i had already bought her album ""when i was made"" and liked it enough.. i decided to search out some other stuff... i never thought this album would floor me the way it did... this album is fantastic and wonderful... one of my favorites... to the point that when i went and saw edie for the first time(she is by the way the nicest person ever ...so wonder to see live...and a fantastic performer...see her if you can... and if you can't her live...her live album is 5 million stars wonderful by the way... definitely look into it)i bought a real copy of this album just because i loved it so even thoguh i had the itunes download... please try this album... it's so good... edie is fabulous...one of the true ARTISTS out there..."
2,"Good lightr when it works, but breaks easy","I read many comment about the cheapness of this product.What the hell, bought two of them, it was not much money... I thought.One of them broke after turned it on-off about ten times. The light don't come on and the switch broke... or connection.The other unit still works but don't expect it to last long if they make it so crappy.I replaced the light bulb with an LED one and it will last much longer, HOWEVER, it gives out about 1/5th of the light and it's useless. If you want this unit to read by in a camping trip with the LED bulb, then it's fine.The 28V bulb is just fine and got a few extras in acase I need a replacement."
5,Serious,Serious is the quentisential groove balled of the 80's....Croon On Dude! I can see where George Michael got his inspiration and style.Billy G!
5,The Joint,"Billy Griffin is the predessor to DeAngelo and Mario. The sweet meaningful Masculinelyrics that anybody, black, white or chartruce can relate to.I believe he was ahead of his time.If this album would have come out in the nineties, it would have been a mega classic. Where is that quality in music now. Maybe Usher?That's it."
5,Track & Field gospel,"With the graceful style, which has become Kenny Moore's trademark, ""Best Efforts"" reveals the compelling stories of such reknown Track & Field maga-stars such as Bill Rogers, Ron Clarke, Sebastain Coe, Eamonn Coghlan, Mary Decker -- and of course the legendary duo of Bill Bowerman and Steve Prefontaine. Through the lense former Olympic Marathoner, and Sport Illustrated writer, Moore delivers the essence of these notable characters. Anyone who seeks out the rationale of why certain athletes inspire others and lead towards greatness, ""Best Efforts"" is a must read."
4,Holy Huge Mailbox!,"This thing is HUGE and that is not an exageration. It's bigger then my yellow lab! If you are looking for a mail box to impress a fisherman, then this is it. Be aware though, that you can't put this on any old post. It really needs a poured cement footing for the post to be able to balance and hold this monster mail box. it's almost 4 feet long an there is a standard size rural type mailbox within the fish. Very impressive mail box though."
1,Poor quality,"Great looking mailbox, but the paint started peeling only 3 months after we put it outside. I contacted River's Edge, but they would not replace it and tried to pass the buck to the retailers. Horrendous customer service, I'll never buy another one of their products and would strongly NOT recommend this product unless you plan on keeping it indoors...otherwise the paint will start peeling in a few months."
1,Fish mailbox,"I purchased this for my son and when he received it the paint of the fish was stuck on the plastic wrap and lifted all the paint off of it! I also saw the same fish which gave me the idea to buy it for my son! The paint on this one which, I don't know how long it's been up, is all white in areas of it to. The paint came off this one too! Very disappointed."
5,Mailbox,Replacing the original Bass mailbox that was several years old & hit with a ballbat this last winter. The Bass mailbox is a fun way of letting friends know where we live.
1,awful!!,"the paint started chipping and peeling a few short months after we got it. its a mailbox so its obviously supposed to be outside.. very poor quality, especially for the price we paid!!"
2,Mail Box,"This Mailbox was great for about one month and then paint began to chip off, it has faded, etc. It was obviously meant to be outside due to it being a mailbox so it should be made so that it does not fade nor chip! Would not recommend this product and especially for the price that I paid!"
2,Too much commentary,"I have read about 60% of the book and I can't seem to pick it up again. Too much commentary and I'll read for an hour and ask myself ""What did I learn?"". I wanted a book that would teach me VB.Net and I probably picked the wrong one. If you want high-level discussion and opinion then this is the book for you. If you want to simply learn specifics about VB.Net, look elsewhere."
5,WOW !!!,"WOW !!! is all i can say ! well done Dan Appleman on a fantastic, fresh and interesting book. who would have thought that a developer could have a sense of humor :)As an experienced VB Developer myself, i found Dan's outlook incredible. Once again he does not simply rehash the documentation but actually shows you how to think ...Eg. he starts off the section on MultiThreading by showing you how not to do it and introduces you to some of the pitfalls of using this powerful new functionality. imagine trying to debug an error that only occurs one in 14 million executions ... hmmmWELL DONE DAN !"
3,Too much blah blah,"Dan, you should stick with the point of covering the subject without trying to be clever and/or slick. That kind of coding unfortunately equates to EXPENSIVE maintenance costs in the real world. I came from a VB6 background and felt frustrated at times, because Dan was trying to cover too much. Maybe more thought should have gone into design and strategy than to meeting deadlines. I did learn from this book, but Dan didn't make it easy."
4,A book that accomplished its mission statement,"A book that accomplished its mission statement.Dan was true to his introduction. The book is intended for the experienced programmer and to that end Dan did a terrific job.Toward this end Dan had to make some compromises, some details were left out. I feel that Dan could have covered the last chapter and especially strong names with a little more details.Otherwise the book gets 2 thumbs up from me."
4,A good first book for VB.NET,"This is a good book for getting the concepts down as far as the differences go between previous versions of VB and the .NET platform version. The only knock I would have is I thought the author got a little too hung up on the inheritance and memory management issues, dragging it out a bit. But overall I found out what I wanted to know."
5,The VB.Net Resource,"Instead of searching through mounds of articles with no clear starting point to learn this new technology, this book I found to be my one stop source for VB.Net Beta2. The material is presented in a manner that truly addresses the hard-core VBer moving to what amounts to a totally different langauge but still offers new comers valuable insight on VB.Net - highly recommended!"
2,Blablablabla...,"There's way better .NET books out there! Get VB.Net Bible or ASP.NET in 21 Days. This one has way too much ""bla bla"" and no code. I really did not enjoy reading this book."
2,Just Strategies and concepts,"Well, i am not a vb6 professional programmer!That was an error of mine, i had a hope on 'moving to' something that would be more consistent than what i can recall from this book.The full coverage of the new concepts, like XML, are taken very lightly, and terms like '...the propouse of this book was not to cover, deeply, this subject...' are very painfull to me.Well, i have to buy other book..."
2,Could be better,"Two problems with this design: 1) it is mounted on the ceiling of the garage in proximity to the garage door opener motor. When the motor opens the door, the vibrations seem to 'redirect' the beam. 2) Lately, the unit does not shut off after the car is parked. It is on AC so this isn't too much of a problem but it does goto 'quality' of production."
2,"confusing product names from Prince, extremely head heavy, vibrates","Prince has very confusing names. This is the 03 Silver that is black in color. The product I really wanted was the 03 Speedport Silver that is actually silver in color. This black colored one is very head heavy and has a very atypical vibration for Prince with the factory strings. *Much* prefer thePrince O3 Speedport Squash Racquet, Silver, though it broke near the throat after the first week. Don't recall hitting a wall any harder than I did with O3 blacks (that are silver, argh) that lasted for months before breaking near the top."
2,Fragile,"This racquet was absolutely amazing for the 10 weeks that I was able to use it. After playing about once a week for 10 weeks it started to splinter just above the handle on one side. I taped the fracture and played one more time before it finally cracked all the way through. I consider myself an intermediate squash player, and I take good care of my equipment. I payed about $120, and I got about 12 plays out of it. $10/play = unacceptable. I gave this racquet 2 stars because it was an amazing racquet while it lasted. I am going to contact customer service to see if I can get a replacement. Take a look at my photos, and you will see what I mean."
1,What a Joke,"Seriously dissaponting, 1st off, I thought it was a book, It's a DVD, oh well, so I played it, i think it was over in like 20 Minutes, or so it seemed. I thought this was gonna be an insiders look at one of golf's legends. Instead what i got was every thing i already knew. Seriously, I saw his press Confrence on TV, its on here, I saw Parnevicks interview, on TV, Yes, its in here. They said he went to Stanford. I knew that back in 95. I didnt learn a thing i didnt already know. But i guess people wanna make a buck from suckers like me. Just think for a moment, its Title, Prodigy"" An UNAUTHORIZED story on Tiger Woods. To me it implies i'm gonna learn something new and actually be entertained. The only thing i learned was i wasted $13.49. Nice work Infinity Enternainment Group!! The only one being Entertained is your Bank portfolio. Nice way to whore out Tigers name and not provide anything remotely resembeling substance."
3,A bit quirky,I have been sing Red hat since ver 7.0. I was really looking forward to the KDE 3.0 desktop. Unfortunately Konqueror and Kmail are both unstable in the 3.0 version. Red hat does not like to support KDE and have not put the KDE 3.0.1 upgrades in the up2date nor have they created the rpm's so people can download them. Almost every other distro supports KDE much better.
3,Better edition is out.,"Red Hat 8 is out, and it is muuuuch better! If you want phone support you need to buy the professional edition; otherwise, you just get email help - which isn't much help. If you are a newbee Windows type of person I would seriously consider Red Hat Professional. Why spend all evening cussing your computer? The only other Linux edition I would consider is Xandros. I haven't tried it yet, but Xandros is the follow on to the old Corel Second Edition of Linux which was a great piece of work."
1,We quickly phased this out.,"If you are standalone then you have nothing to worry about. However, if you are on a network and have UNIX machines, there is a really nasty bug with NFS.Our RH machines actually brought a switched network to its knees.RedHat as to form said to get the next release."
2,Impossible to straighten,"Cable works fine, but it is absolutely impossible to make it lie flat/straight - it curls up into a helix no matter what I do with it. I wish I had bought a more expensive higher quality cable, because this stuff is so painful to work with."
5,The search for perfect coffee...,"We absolutely LOVE this grinder. We owned a refurbished BUNN grinder and it was incredibly loud and didn't grind very fine, causing us to use lots more coffee than we should have. Then we tried our Magic Bullet and it ground the coffee fine, but it was bitter. This Capresso grinder is wonderful. It grinds from coarse to ultra fine without bitterness. It is extremely easy to change the grind, so any type of coffee can be ground to suit your preference. We like our coffee strong and rich and now my husband grinds coffee fresh every morning without waking the whole house. And the brushed chrome looks very stylish on the counter. I highly recommend this grinder."
5,Great Grinder,"I had heard many horror stories about coffee grinders--machines that constantly jammed, that offered no control over fineness of the grind, or that failed to grind consistently at any setting. Other machines, I had heard, worked well but tended to rattle the windows with their roaring sound or required hours to clean. So I approached purchase of such a grinder cautiously, and put off buying any machine for months while I looked at as many options as I could find.My caution was rewarded in the Capresso machine. It is not noisy at all, it grinds consistently with 12 possible settings, and after a few months of grinding various sorts of coffee, it has not jammed once. It is also quite easy to clean, and takes up very little space.I had had no problems with the machine, and can recomment it very highly."
4,Brushed Chrome? I don't think so,"Had I read the detailed description, I would have understood that the finish on this guy is NOT brushed chrome but rather a hard-anodized zinc-oxide finish. This is not to say that it looks bad - it just doesn't match my brushed chrome coffee maker.Read the other reviews for performance details - they echo my own feelings on those matters. (Read: Superb)"
4,Cosmetically Nice-Small Footprint-Heavy weight,"Very pleased with this Grinder, Minuses---Brushed Chrome a little pricey. The plastic bin is to thin, could be heavier. Small piece broke off while unpackaging grinder. Time dial somewhat flimsy but still works after few weeks. Pluses--Quiet motor, heavy weight, stays put on counter. Burr grinder has five settings-course to very fine espresso. Grinds perfectly. Container to catch coffee good size, pulls out easily. Nice machine, would buy again, hope I don't have to."
5,Excellent Grinder,I bought this as a gift for my parents and was immediately impressed by the weight. This is a much heavier and more quiet grinder than my Melitta burr grinder. I also think that the grind settings are more consistent on this grinder. I'm saving up to buy one for myself!!
4,"Good Value, Nice machine",This is my second Capresso grinder; it works great. I would suggest it to someone who uses it daily. I love it.
1,Don't Buy It!,"I've had the grinder for two years and it just died. I make one pot of coffee a day, so the grinder wasn't over-used.It worked just OK for the two years I had it, but it had several MAJOR design flaws. The worst being that from day one, you had to stand by the grinder because it would start whining and not grinding. You'd have to shake it to get the beans to go down into the burr part of the grinder - so that grinding would begin again.I've had very low-cost, non-burr grinders that lasted for a decade or more. In fact I just started using one of them again now that the Capresso died. For the premium price, it was a joke. It didn't last and it didn't even work well when before it died!"
2,Static Electricity Problem,"Does an ok job grinding my coffee, but there is so much static electricity generated that it makes a huge mess on my ountertop and even the floor. I grind a pound at a time not just a pot's worth. I am very dissatisfied with this product. Not worth the effort cleaning up the mess."
5,"Love, love, love this!","We love this grinder! We have gone through several grinders over the years, and this is the quietest grinder we have ever used. It won't wake the whole house in the early morning! It also does a quick job of grinding from coarse to espresso fine, without making a huge mess. We thought it rather expensive, but after using it we aren't sorry for having spent the money."
3,"Burr grinder ""sticks""","I have bought two of these grinders and have had problems with both. It grinds very well, but ground coffee lodges in the center burr and discharge chute, and the grinder must be dismantled after every use to clean it out. The coffee catcher fits loosely. I used a rubber band to secure it. Some ground coffee falls out when the catcher is removed. The lid of the bean hopper also fits loosely.However, the worst problem is that both units burned out within a year of purchase. The motor is not repairable. (I tried.)I am giving up on this model and buying a Kitchen Aid Proline instead."
4,Very Good Espresso\Coffee\Burr Grinder,"The Capresso 565.04 is a very good burr grinder. It is easy to use and quiet. The only thing that would make it better would be if it were made easier to clean somehow, particularly the lower chamber of the grinder. That notwithstanding, it does a fine job of grinding beans. I use Kona beans and they are excessively oily and this grinder does them very well. You may want to use the first ""fine"" setting if you are going to use Kona beans to make espresso because anything much finer will likely clog your espresso machine's basket. Trial and error will help you. I recommend this product."
5,Excellent Grinder!,I received this grinder as a birthday gift a couple days ago and am very pleased with it. It is a LOT quieter than several other grinders I have used in the past and the grind is very uniform from fine to course. My coffee roasting buddies are going to be jealous when they see it!
3,Not discounted,"139.99 is the standard price, not discounted, and is the same as as MSRP (from manuf. web site: ""MSRP:Infinity Conical Burr Grinder Model #565.04 (metal, chrome brushed): $139.99)"".Still good deal with free shipping."
1,"Sorry, I Can't Go Along With the Crowd",I bought this Burr Grinder 2 years ago and we like to grind our coffee very fine. I am talking about a grind that looks like dust. This unit constantly clogged up and had to be unassembled and cleaned out. This is an utter nightmare as I used a Dust Remover to blow out the clogged unit! I am talking coffee everywhere! Then the wife complained. Sometimes I had to do this twice a week. We use Starbuck's Dark French Roast. When I called the company they told me I was grinding my coffee too fine and that my beans were too fresh. They suggested I allow air to hit my coffee beans and dry out for several days before I attempted to grind them. Needless to say that didn't work and now I use a Mr. Coffee K-Mart special. At least when I wake up I am guaranteed a fresh cup of coffee in 5 minutes (with my Bunn commercial brewer). The unit looks nice but if it has to be serviced at least twice a month it is worthless to me.
1,great mill bad price deception,"First, the grinder is awesome, the list price is not as amazon claims $190 the MSRP on this item is 139.99 asp the manufacturers web site. I bought mine at a local store for the same ""discount"" price. The real harm in this is that I knew my local store would have it at list but after seeing amazon's inflated list price I didn't even look locally. fortunately, I checked the manufacturers site. buyer beware."
5,"Before their was Twisted Christmas, there was...","Ray Stevens continues a brilliant career in both straight forward and comic recordings, and does it well. Tis album includes the classic hard to find ""Little Drummer Boy Next Door"". If you ahven't heard it, once you do, you'll know someone just like it... I can guarantee it!!! Enjoy and Stay 2nd :-)"
3,He's everywhere!,"This CD features comedy Christmas songs with a country flavor by Ray Stevens. Songs are about such subjects as annoying relatives, romance, rednecks, office parties, bad kids and Santa Claus. I found most of the songs to be moderately amusing. My personal favorite is probably ""The Little Drummer Boy Next Door"", about a kid who annoys him by banging on the drums he got for Christmas. There is a remake of Ray's classic 1962 Christmas hit ""Santa Claus is Watching You"". While the original features Ray warning kids to behave, this one features Ray warning his woman that she better treat him right. The original is much funnier, as far as I'm concerned. Still, fans of musical comedy will probably find something to enjoy on this album."
5,great value,"Received my used copy of this over-sized art book today and I haven't been able to put it down! Beautiful reproductions and interesting copy. I wish I had the $$ to buy a hardcover because I know I'll wear the binding out on this paperback by referring to it constantly(I'm a painter), but for $15 this was a great value!"
2,Very Poor Reproductions of Some Beautiful Works,"Having seen the exhibit behind the book, I looked forward to reviewing the many gorgeous paintings I saw. Although the text in the book is fine, the pictures are alas not. Many are in black and white, but the real disappointment came in the color reproductions where things were really second rate, looking more suitable for postcards than a fine art book. I returned my copy to Amazon, and I would suggest you save your money unless there is no other way you will see some of his work. Very disappointing!"
2,overpriced,"I saw this exhibit in DC last week and Sargent's works were so gorgeous that it's worth your time to see it twice and wait in line. But I have to admit a great sense of disappointment in this book because many reproductions are not true to the original. The colors were not as vivid- this is really noticeable in the watercolors which were duller copies of the originals. The stories are interesting, but you can get that from other Sargent books. This book is overpriced for what it offers because you won't be able to get a sense of Sargent's brilliant colors. One good thing about this book is that it had a color reproduction of several of Sargent's works that is not available in other books. If you're looking for a better book, I suggest ""Sargent Abroad."""
3,"Great content, not so great reproductions.","First off, you will never be satisfied with any reproduction compared to the original painting. Sargent's paintings in the MFA in Boston looks like the paint was laid yesterday. But I have seen several reproductions of this work, the originals in the MFA and MOMA in NY, and of all the major books I have seen, this has the most disappointing reproductions. The colors seem muted and flat.On the other hand, the information on each painting is great, and for specific info on his works in a one volume set, this can't be beat."
2,wasnt worth it,when i saw the matches i wasnt impressed. the pay per view just didnt seem like a king of the ring pay per view but a raw is war show. sorry 2 say but the wwf really made me mad with the stupid matches they put together the main event wasnt that good. i like austin but this was the period when wrestlin ran outta vince vs austin story lines. but its a event u have 2 see if u is a big wrestlin fan of thee wwf...12/12/02
5,Awesome!,"this event rockes and will be remembered forever! it features the unforgettable, brutal hell in a cell match! buy it now!"
5,Absolute Heart-Stopping Entertainment,"Buying this was the single best thing i have ever done with my money. Every match, form Taka and the Headbangers vs. Kaientai to the HELL IN A CELL was great. After watching the HELL IN A CELL i didn't think Austin vs. Kane would be any good, but i was wrong! Mick Foley and Undertaker even made a run in. This pay-per view was breathtaking. If you didn't like Mick Foley, after this tape you will see him in a whole new light. If you call yourself a WWF fan you need this tape. This PPV is a must buy. Order NOW!"
2,Over-rated,"I bought this video coming highly recommended, and was quite dissapointed. I was a fan of the ""old WWF,"" but this was said to be one of the best PPVs in recent memory so I said what the heck. The Hell in the Cell match is mothing great, and the main event is highly forgetable. To give this video 2 stars I had to watch the undercard which provided a ton of action from an era of the WWF I'm not too familiar with, this impressed me. If I was to suggest anything from the recent WWF, I guess it would be this tape, but it's still nothing great."
5,BEST MATCH I HAVE EVER SEEN,"The Hell in a Cell match between the Undertaker and Mankind is the best match that I have ever seen. It is simply incredible. Good matches in the King of the Ring tournament between Shamrock, the Rock, Jarrett and Severn. Awesome matches. X-Pac and Owen is a great match too. Kane and Austin was a little below what they're capable of however"
2,This was one of the worst WWF PPVs in a long time,"This PPV really sucked. The tournament was pathetic, with not a lot of entertainmant. Jeff Jarrett, Al Snow, Val Venis, The Godfather & Triple H did not wrestle. There was only one title match, and it sucked. (Rock-Undertaker). The IC title, the European title, the Women's title and the tag team titles were not defended. Do not waste your money on this trash."
3,King Of The Ring 99 could of been much better.,KING OF THE RING 99 was alright but there where not alot of good matchs every match was pretty good but non of them where like top matchs the only really good match was The Rock vs Undertaker that was a great WWF Champion Match but HHH made the rock lose the match but it was a great match but every other match was only okay nothing very good the ladder match was a okay but a littel boring but it was alright if you want a Ladder Match go get WWF No Mercy overall WWF KING OF THE RING i give a 6/10.
3,GOOD EVENT WITH STONE COLD.,THE SHOW WAS NOT SLOW OR BORRING.PS I WOULD BUY IT FOR THE LADDER MATCH.
1,please!,Just because mankind fell off a steel cage doesn't mean it's legendary! What's legendary is hulk hogan and andre the giant at wrestlemania 3. King of the ring's hell in a cell match meant nothing cause it's fake. No matter how real it looks! Now some people say blah blah blah who cares if it's fake well i don't! Soc don't exclude me from a legendary match!
1,When Billy Gunn wins KOTR ya know your in for a long night!,"King Of The Ring was horrible.I a match that should have been good, Vince Russo screws everything up and has X-pac go over Hardcore Holly by DQ. Then, in the finals, Billy Gunn, BILLY GUNN,wins the tournament over X-pac. Say what you want about Pac but he is one of the most talented wrestlers ever. I don't even want to talk about the rest of the (...) card."
2,WWF King of the Ring 1999 Review,"This was not a very good pay-per-view from the World Wrestling Federation. The Heavyweight title match between The Undertaker and The Rock was very poor, at least for The Undertaker, who almost always has excellent matches. The main event was alright, but I still think that when you put Steve Austin and the McMahons in one ring, there is 0% wrestling ability. The undercard totally sucked with matches like Billy Gunn vs. X-Pac and The Big Show vs. Kane. Looking at it on paper, you would think that these matches would make up a great card, but the matches weren't very good at all. June of 1999 was one of the worst months in WWF history. Poor storylines and poor matches put this King of the Ring in the ""worst KOTR"" category. Don't buy this video, but you could probably rent it and decide for yourself. This video is not recommended."
3,The Low Down On KOTR 99,"This King of the Ring was average...much like alot of the spring/early summer WWF PPV's. The Tournament itself was all about DX. Road Dogg, Chyna, BA Billy Gunn, and Xpac were all in the semis. And the finals proved the ""greatest member.""Rock v Undertaker was a decent championship match...ill just say that HHH is involved. T he main event was OK. Austin v the Mcmahons for control of the WWF. They end up taking down the entire set of the PPV and the outcome of the match is not surprising.Overall, a decent PPV. But if ur going to spend the money for a 1999 PPV buy Wrestlemania, Summerslam or No Mercy 99."
3,A mediocre PPV,"This is an OK PPV. The Austin vs. McMahons is the best though. All the other matches aren't all that good. The KOTR Tournement is pretty boring. Don't buy it, but Rent it."
4,"Undercard sucks, but Hell in The Cell rocks","The undercard was incredibly boring, and was mostly jobber matches. The Foley vs. Undertaker match was one of the best I have ever seen. It could turn any person into a wrestling fan. The main event of Austin vs. Kane was boring, though. First Blood matches are always cumbersome and crappy."
4,Off With Their Heads,"WWF King of the Ring 1998 was the most talked about PPV of the year. All because of one match...Hell In A Cell. The Undertaker and Mankind put on an amazing match. This match tells you one thing, who is the most motivated sports entertainer in wrestling history. The WWF Championship goes on the line for the first time with First Blood rules. Champion-Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Challenger-Kane. The annual King of the Ring tournament includes Ken Shamrock vs. Jeff Jarrett and The Rock vs. Dan ""The Beast"" Severn. The WWF Tag Team Champions-New Age Outlaws defend their titles against the NWA Tag Team Champions-The New Midnight Express(Bart Gunn and Bob Holly.) Al Snow and Head take on Too Much with ""THE MAN""-Jerry ""The King"" Lawler as the special guest referee. X-Pac takes on Owen Hart with Chyna at ringside. The Headbangers and WWF Light Heavyweight Champion-Taka Michinoku take on Kaientai in a bonus 6-man tag team match."
1,"King of the ring is supposed to elevate stars, right???","Some of the tournament matches aren't even good enough for RAW, and the main is the worst WWF ladder match ever. Hardys/E&C is not good either. And the winner of KOTR is a tag wrestler whose push fails. Everything on this show has no long-term meaning at all. Strongest recommendation to avoid."
2,KOTR 99,"Rarely does the WWF fail to pull off a top notch PPV, the ladder match between Austin and the McMahons was good, but not spectacular. The Rock vs The Untertaker match was very good, the Rock had it won in like the first minute with the ref down, that kinda hurt the match in my opinion, overall the title match was pretty good. Edge & Christian vs The Hardy Boyz was good too, the history between those teams began right here. The tournament matches were nothing special. Rent this one like I did, save your bucks for a better show."
5,HELL IN THE CELL!,"This ppv was amazing all because of these titles: Hell in The Cell and First Blood! The First blood match for the wwf championship was a good brawl with Austin defending his prize against Kane who won the number 1 contendership spot by defeating his older brother, The Undertaker. The most brutal match ever took place when Mankind and Undertaker stepped into a cell! After Mankind plunges over the top of the cell and lands through The Spanish Annoucers Table, the match stops. Mankind then gets back up off the streatcher after abuot 8 minutes, and gets chokeslammed through the cell roof. The match is stopped again, but Mankind doesn't stop there. They have a good bloody brawl after that where Undertaker gets a pile driver on a chair. Mankind gets a sack of thumbtacks from under the ring, and dumps the tacks in the ring. Undertaker chokeslams Mankind on the tacks, and then tombstones him on them! That is just a preview of this amazing ppv!"
4,Decent ppv,"This pay per view was decent but not great. The best match was the brood versus the Hardy Boys. It was short, but awesome."
5,HISTORY IN THE MAKING...A NEW LEGEND IS BORN,"In this non stop pay per view to crown the new king of the ring, i witnessed the greatest match in the history of the WWF. The hell in a cell match between Mankind and the Undertaker. This match boosted Mick Foley, to superstar status. All fans gained much respect to this insane wrestler, who as good ole JR says,""Is the king of the Deathmatch (an IWA tournament in Japan). If you are a die-hard wrestling fan or just a Mankind fan, i highly suggest you buy this tape!!"
5,This was a classic,This is a five star match between Mankind and The Undertaker. Foley is a living legend after the dive off the cage. I had to buy this tape twice just to see the infamous toss of the cell. Once again Foley is a legend and the of course the Undertaker is awsome too.
5,WELL worth the money!,"I bought this tape for $35 last year, and it was NOT a mistake. This is a must have for any WWF Fan. It features the best match of 1998 - a Hell in a Cell match between Mankind and The Undertaker. Also, a very great match that is overlooked - Ken Shamrock vs. The Rock, The King of the Ring final. This had me on the edge of my seat. Also, a First Blood match between ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and Kane. If you like BLOOD, and lots of brawling all throughtout the arena, this match is for you! Other matches include X-Pac vs. Owen Hart (good match), The New Midnight Express vs. The New Age Outlaws (decent match), and The 4 man King of the Ring Tournament with Ken Shamrock, Jeff Jarrett, The Rock and Dan Severn. This is a sure fire hit, and if you want my advice - BUY THIS TAPE!"
4,Capresso Infinity Coffee Grinder - Chrome,"The grind produced are really even in particle size. The grinding-range is large. The crapresso produces from very coarse grinds for french press to powderish grind suitable for espresso. However, there is only two settings down in the espresso-range, and that is too few for the capresso to be used as an espresso-grinder.Watch out when removing the hopper! The plastic edges can break!The round/ellipsical design is great and especially in the chrome version, the grinder is aesthetically pleasing.All in all, this is a very usuable grinder for fast and easy high-quality grinding of coffee for french press, drip and similar applications."
4,Great Grinder,"A very consistent grinder if you know how to turn it on. I grind only for one pot at a time. The power knob starts the motor and a mechanical timer. As soon as you begin to turn the knob, the grinder starts, but the timer doesn't count down until you release the knob. So, quickly turn and release the knob. If you grind for more than a pot at a time, this isn't a problem. This grinder is a big improvement over my old ""propellor"" grinder. Can't compare with other brands, since I've never used 'em."
4,Grinds Extra Fine,"I had purchased a new $500 espresso machine and my old grinder would not grind fine enough for a good espresso. On the highest ""extra fine"" setting (4 settings each level) this grinder grinds too fine, my espresso machince can't force water through the grounds (they are like powder). I then tried the highest ""Fine"" setting and it is just about right. Still need to experiment some, as of now I'm happy with the unit."
3,Very Large and a Little Messy,"There is nothing really wrong with the Capresso 565.03 Infinity Burr Grinder. However, if you believe that this unit will solve your coffee ground mess problem, you will probably be slightly disappointed. Also, it is a very large item. So, if you have a small kitchen and limited space, it may be a bit on the sizeable side. Functionally, it works great. I love that you can set the grind settings from fine to coarse, turn the dial, and not worry about how long to grind the beans for."
4,Super,Positively stunning tone and clean picking from front to back. A super album from a vastly underated player.
3,Usefull adaptor,"This item is pretty inexpensive and very practical. However, remember the saying: ""You get what you pay for"". It does what it's supposed to do, but there are only 4 stations you can choose from, two which are never in range and it comes off the plug very easy, as well as having a very short cable. So you'd better make sure you have a place to put the iPod because you wont be able to pull it much from the lighter hole given the short cable and specially since it's very loose, it'll come off very easy if you move it much. All in all, like i said, it does what it needs to do, it just needs special care."
3,"Not excellent product, but works","This one works OK until now, however there is some background noise for MP3 songs."
4,How to avoid falling in love with a jerk.,"The book is a pretty good manual to be used toward not making the mistakes that we keep committing over and over when we choose our love partners. It gives examples of almost every possible scenario and provides warnings and red flags about those choices that we must elude. The thing I liked the most, it also provides education for ourselves about how to behave toward our possible matches. The importance of this is that most of the times we do things without being conscious that we are acting in some way or doing something that may be perceived as a red flag.If you apply the tips and suggestions within this book, most surely you will be a better companion and would also save yourself from more heartaches."
4,Great Info for both men and women,This book gives both men and women things to look for when you are looking the the person to spend the rest of your life with. It helps you to ask the right questions on the first date that will bring out the deal breakers up front. This is a must read for anyone who is out there dating. Enjoy!!
5,good shape,"I got the book and it was in new condition and cheap, very useful. I originally heard about it at the fellowship of catholic university students national conference and jumped on it."
5,Disco Dozier!,This record was on Sony/Columbia during the disco days. Lamont Dozier strikes again with solid grooves for dancers. These recordings provide slow and medium tempo grooves as well as the aerobics. Essentials for Lamont Dozier fans.
1,Nice but software doesn't work,The USB Temperature and Humidity Data Logger looks like a nice product. The software installed easily. Windows only software crashed when data logger was plugged in. Upgraded the software from the website and was able to configure the probe. Let probe monitor for a week and plugged it in to download the data and the software crashed again. I'm unable to use the probe at all due to the fact that the software crashes when trying to download the data to my computer. This happens on all my computers. I opened a service request via the website and received a voicemail response once. It's hard to believe that they ruined what looks like an excellent product by writing terrible software to manage it. Don't buy this product line - their software is garbage.
3,Only Windows drivers,"Works as advertised even though readings are a bit high and there is no calibration support.However, what's really annoying is that Lascar only supports Windows and does not publish adequate details for third-party developers creating a Linux or OS X driver."
3,"Starts Strong, worth a look, but not as serious as I had hoped.","This book starts out very strong and encouraging for those of us who have suffered from post-partum depression. The author gives an honest account of her experience with the disease in the first couple of chapters.The rest of he book seems to be made up of articles or short writings about her life after baby. The chapters are funny and well-written (Could they have been published before, in a newspaper?). Certainly worth reading. The problem is that these chapters do not address or expound upon the process she went through, or really describe what it means to ""throw (one's) mental health out with the diapers.""I have read and enjoyed many funny/real accounts about life after babies. I thought this book would go deeper into the experience. Unfortunately, it did not."
2,"I'd would rename it ""Unreadable""","I think pretty much everything that the author has to say can be (and is!) said in the first 30 pages or so. After that, it's bits and pieces, loosely strung together but without a goal in sight. Neither a great resource for those dealing with PPD nor a good comic relief."
2,Consistently disappoints,"This book is part of the Foundations in Diagnostic Path series. As a practicing general pathologist, I perform a great amount of breast pathology, and this book suffers from its own brevity (I have the same complaint with their GI text--the GU books seems a little more complete). YES, this book might certainly be useful for a trainee looking for an alternative to the breast chapter in Sternberg or Rosai, but it just isn't comprehensive enough for daily practice---every time I try to use this book to answer a question, I end up having to pull out the larger Rosen book anyway."
5,Para Cuando el Siguiente!?!?,"Una serie de ensayos-reflexiones-ficciones que de repente te confundes con la realidad!! Me moria por leerlo, este Señor es un señorote para escribir, con un sentido del humor muy peculiar, no es de los autores te van dando señales y ya casi le adivinas que sigue... para nada!!! cada renglon es una sorpresa tras otra, lastima que este libro salio tan corto...Xavier Velasco es para mi de los autores que deberian escribir libros de 500 paginas!"
4,Urban Exploration 101,"For anyone in the ""Urban Exploration"" scene, the name Ninjalicious is almost legendary. Not that he was one of the first to explore tunnels and old buildings, but he was one of the first to really achieve some level of fame for doing so. So the source for this information is more than credible.If you are a veteran explorer, this book probably will not tell you much you don't already know. If you are just beginning to explore, this may be a helpful guide, but you'd be better off finding experienced people and going with them. A little experience and a good amount of common sense should see you through.That said, I still would recommend this book to any active or armchair explorer. The author's humor makes reading this book a joy and the personal stories he includes are highly entertaining. So if nothing else, read it for fun. Plus, you never know. There may be a gem or 2 of wisdom in there for even the most veteran explorer."
5,Engaging voice,"Like some other reviewers, I wasn't sure that I would enjoy a book written by someone called Ninjalicious. Now, I am not sure anyone could NOT enjoy this book. The author is wise, kind, thoughtful, and funny. This is not just a book about urban exploration. It's about ethics, and psychology, and space, too. It's kind of a manual for living an engaged life. I envy anyone who knew Ninjalicious. He seems like a brilliant guy."
4,A great book by a great man,"As a long time urban explorer, this book didn't really tell me much I didn't already know or that a little common sense couldn't figure out once you have been to a few places. That fact notwithstanding, this is a great introductory book to the art of urban exploration, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into the hobby. It has lots of good pointers that would have been a lot easier to read then they were to figure out in my own."
4,Welcome to The Tunnell,"Danny gives his clubbers a great breakdown of deep hard house, especially with his vader-like dark voice. The tribal beats are mixed well with the latin percussions and the dark hooks. A must for the serious Dj. Where's the vinyl, Amazon? -Dj NuYorikan Seoul"
5,Wach out!,"This record is a for sure ""staple"" in my record case. There is just something so dark and erotic about the synthed out vocal on this track. Seems to have strong appeal to the female side of the house also. This is good for end or beginning f the night!"
3,"Does not play CD-R or RW, or DVD-RAM","Overall a nice 3 DVD changer with all of the options and outputs. Great picture quality and sound. If your plan is to keep a DVD in one of the slots and music in the other 2 than this is NOT the DVD player for you for 2 reasons: 1) it doesn't play CD-R's, 2) The repeat disc mode doesn't work well."
3,It's interesting!,The multicultural stories are interesting. It helps me compare my culture to other cultures based on the same story.
5,Mutabaruka's poems in patois span the decades,"This is an unusual and enthralling collection for a number of reasons. The format is brilliant; his early poems are presented under a cover on one side and if you flip the book over, the new (""Next"") poems stand on their own, under another cover. I was stuck by Mutabaruka's innovative word play; he's expressive on many levels and the fact that much of this is in Jamaican vernacular makes for an almost Chauceresque reading experience; you ""hear"" the poems as much as you read them. His is a powerful voice, with strong spiritual and geopolitical threads running throughout. No matter if you read the new poems first or the first ones first, it's a literary journey well worth taking and taking again.Bob Merlis, author of Heart & Soul: A Celebration of Black Music Style in America, 1930-1975"
5,Gripping!,"There is a lot of useful information packed into this book for anyone facing cancer and wanting to find what has worked for others. I have used many of the excellent resources the author provides.I read this book after my own much less perilous search for an alternative solution to cancer to see if the author had been lucky enough to find glyconutrients too. When I got into the book, I did not want to put it down and felt like I was right there beside him at every step. The author shares so candidly that by the end of the book, he begins to feel like a close friend.Stay healthy, Mr. Manley, so you can write more books."
2,Old and dusty fuel filter,"Product arrived very fast in an old box and was very dusty. It appears to have been on a shelf for a long time. Because of my urgent need to change my filter the hassle of sending it back, I will use it a temporary fix. I think I will go back to just buying books from Amazon. Too many defective products from their partners lately."
1,Do NOT buy this for your guinea pig!!,"I have loved amazon and I think it is a good web-site but I am very mad at them, (like the other reviewers), for putting this on market!! This will hurt your piggy, cause them permanent damage and in a severe case could kill them! DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR PIGGY! I think anyone who buys this should be put down for animal abuse!!!"
3,"Good, but can be useless","The ball itself is good quality, really big and well done. I like the concept, but rats don't seem to like it. The are scared of that ball, and get really stressed when I put them there. Once they are in there, they don't know that they supposed to have fun, they think they are in trouble. So I decided to let them used to it first by being around the ball on the sofa and being able to walk in and out the open yet ball. That helped, but still, it will never be rats favourite activity I guess. Maybe your rat will react differently, try it. If not, then you can always resell it on Amazon as used."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FOR GUINEA PIGS!,"Guinea pigs' spines do not bend like this. They should never ever run in a wheel or exercise ball. Super Pet needs to stop marketing these for guinea pigs, as they are responsible for hundreds of injuries each year. I'm sure they're great for other animals, but not guinea pigs."
1,Not for cavies....,"Cut *Amazon* some slack -- if you look at the picture, zoom in, and read it, the Super Pet people ARE clearly marketing it for Guinea Pigs -- they name them on the box. Shame on Super Pet for marketing this product to consumers who don't know better."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FOR GUINEA PIGS!,"This is a sure way to permanently damage your guinea pig's spine and win an expensive trip to the vet's office! The same holds true for exercise wheels. Guinea pig's spines DO NOT bend in the manner necessary for them to run using either item. For the safest exercise, get some storage grids, make a pen and put down an old blanket and let them run around. You'll be happy to watch them run and popcorn! For more information about guinea pigs, please check this website: [...]"
1,WTF?,"I just received this item and my six year old opened it with great expectations of putting her rat inside and watching him run. WTF? There is no lid to the ball... It says on the package ""place your pet inside and turn the lid to seal"". Where would this lid be? We relooked through the box...no lid. My son pointed out that there was tape on the ball where the lid must have been taped to it, but no lid included. I seriously don't have time to deal with this crap. How idiotic do you have to be to realize a ball with a hole and no lid does not work? I told the rat to not leave the ball, but he just ran out and peed on me. Typical rat. Come on Amazon....."
1,Do NOT use this!!!!,"PLEASE do NOT use these for piggies!!!! If you have a guinea pig, this is not a good idea... Little piggie's backs are not as flexible as rats, mice, or hamsters so they really cannot use these without risk of injury to their backs. It is not a good idea if you want a healthy, happy squeaker!"
2,DO NOT PURCHASE FOR RATS,"Many people have reviewed stating the dangers of using such products with guinea pigs, but I haven't seen many warning about using this with rats. Toes can get stuck and cause breaks in a rats' feet or pull out toenails, there is poor ventilation and rats have extremely sensitive respiratory tracts, and any wastes that are excreted get stuck in this ball. Many rats freak out when put in these, anyway because of their poor eyesight. They rely on other senses to move around, and these balls take away basically all of them. They should really be let out of their cage for at least an hour a day in a rat-proofed area because they are very intelligent, and it's not only safer to let them run free, but they enjoy it better because they like to interact with their surroundings!"
1,Not for guineas!,I mistakenly bought this. I thaught guinea pigs could use this because it clearly states for guinea pigs on the heading. Although nowhere on the box does it say this. I feel i was duped by this company. Pigs do not use balls like this. I wasted a much needed $20. It was also broken when we got it.
1,SHAME ON AMAZON FOR MARKETING THIS FOR PIGGIES!!,"You will harm your guinea if you buy this for them. They are not a gerbil or hamster and their backs are not made for this. i can't believe AMAZON is marketing this ball for them. Any pet store who knows anything about these animals will tell you not to purchase a ball for them. I love amazon, but they are putting guinea pigs at risk by leaving this on their site. SHAME ON THEM!! You can see the packaging clearly has a RAT on it, not a guinea!!"
1,Guinea pigs should NEVER be put into an exercise ball!,"Guinea pigs should not EVER be put into an exercise ball. This causes spinal injury and can be easily avoided. Also they won't move in one anyway because it hurts them. Please do not put your piggies in a ball. To give them exercise, put them into a play pen of some kind and let them run around on a flat surface. If you don't believe me, feel free to ask a vet."
1,not for a guinea pig.,I've researched that guinea pig's backs are NOT meant to bend... there spines are very fragile! Siting and running in a ball may cause spine damage.
1,hurt my rat,"Firstly, our rats hate the ball. They got nervous, ran & bumped into everything. I would have tolerated that since they hate the wheel also and need some exercise occassionally. However, when we took one of our boys out of the ball yesterday, we noticed blood on the ball and on his toe. He must have gotten his toenail caught somehow and it ripped the toenail off. Poor little guy. Will never use this again."
1,Do not buy,"This ball broke before it was even completely removed from the packaging. It has two doors that you rotate a few degrees to unlock and pop off so your pet can get inside, but the tabs on those doors that lock in are so fragile almost all of them have broken off within an hour of use. The doors don't stay on at all and the whole ball itself is already cracking down the sides without even being dropped or handled roughly once. As far as the toy for a pet, I bought it for my ferrets, I have 2 and neither of them really liked it even after I fixed the door situation with some tape. So if you are buying this for ferrets that's just my experience."
1,Guinea pigs can NOT run in a ball!,No matter what the label says guinea pigs can not run in a ball or on a wheel -- they will get hurt! It is very bad for their spines. Get a playpen instead!
1,Screaming!,"I bought this when i first bought my kids' guinea pig and tried to shove her in it, i thought she was just chunky and over weight. She screamed so loud, i felt horrible. I didn't buy from amazon and didn't have these reviews to read. Be sure NOT to buy a ball for your piggie! She is fine, but i could have really hurt her."
3,Guinea pig run-about,"I received the first one-- and it was broken and the usps office said that it was received damaged. Had to return-- but the one i received later on, i love."
2,"Cool idea, but extremely unsafe","This toy looks really cool, but we found that it leans backward when a child climbs it ( 50 pound 6 year old ). It leans so much that she would fall off further back than the base, ending up on the floor! If I stand on the opposite side and hold it, it works ok, but this gets old real fast. Definitely not a good buy!"
1,Poor quality and unsafe,"I purchased this climbing wall for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas last year (2003). From the start it had a ""slow"" leak that I could not locate - only to find out that it had a tear on the inside of the base and the two chambers eventually became one. Soon after that a tear appeared in one of the footholes. This toy was definitely a disappointment to say the least."
3,DO NOT PAY THIS PRICE,WE SET UP THE MOUNTAIN IN WHICH SOMEONE HAS TO HOLD IT AT ALL TIMES EVEN IF YOU TIE IT TO SOMETHING. IT BROKE IN ONE WEEKEND AND NEVER COULD FIX IT. WORTHLESS.
1,Horrible!,"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas a while back. Like other reviewers have said, it wouldn't stay upright without someone holding it. My kids had a blast tipping it on it's side and climbing up the blue part and sliding down the base.... for about 2 days until a giant 2 foot hold ripped in it while my daughter was sliding down. It was her favorite Christmas present and she will still (1 1/2 yrs later) cry if reminded about it."
1,leaks and needs retinning in a few years,"Well, unfortunately I bought this beautiful EXPENSIVE double boiler. After 3 or 4 years time the handle leaks copious amounts of water out of the bracket holes. I am now told that's part of normal wear and tear and MY problem. At first they told me to mail it to France to have it fixed (from California!) LOL. They told me it needs to be retinned every few years too and that's why mine is leaking. I am very angry. Nobody told me this when I bought it. It also came with cancer warnings because of the handles. I will NEVER again buy any Mauviel product."
1,useless,two of the three outlet it does not work and the one does work has static so is cheaper to check it out in your local dollar store i get mine in the dollar store $1.25 after i throw this one
3,"Great, until they go bad","Ok, so these speakers are the best, until about 1-2 years after you have been using them on a regular basis. They have great surround sound, and quality construction. On the other hand, since I have owned two sets of these, I can safely say that the rear 'wireless' speaker never seems to work, no matter how hard I try. Also, after one year, the center speaker that attaches to the bottom of the monitor begins to 'crackle' during louder music/sounds. My second set (the first set went out), has served me well for about 2 years now, and is just now starting to go bad. Glad Dell finally pulled these off the market, but I still wish there were better options for Dell branded speakers to choose from now. The A525 model was a much better choice over the WL6000."
4,Asian Wave sound,"On this Cd you can listen to high-tech music composed with computers (what we call it ""uchikomi"" in Japanese). Of course groovy, but not only that, filled with energies of asian emotions and passions. Most of their songs are sung in Japanese. Susumu Hirasawa, the vocal who leads the band is quite famous in Japan and other asian countries. These days, he has released several solo albums (you can listen to it even on the web!!)."
5,Rachel Ray Skillet,This is a nice heavy pan that cooks evenly. The handle is also good because it does not get hot with the rubber cover.
1,Delivery,"The product is great and exactly what was ordered. However, delivery took way too long. I ordered it on May 1st for Mother's Day on May 10th. I thought that 10 days would have been plenty of time. But it was not and my mom did not receive the pan until May 13th. As a result, I was very disappointed and would not order from this vendor again."
