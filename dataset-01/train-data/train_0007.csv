3,Fahrenheit 451 is a creepy book,"This book painted a very dark and bleak future for mankind. Part of the future is firemen that don't fight fires but rather burn books. Why? Because the powers that be determined that what was in books could offend, confuse, depress, and sadden people, etc.Fahrenheit 451 depicts a society where it is best to make books illegal and burn them in order to keep society ""politically correct"". Just keep people happy watching television and and doing other mindless activities.I thought the book was well done in depicting the dilemna one firefighter faces and the actions he takes while living and working in such a world.The book probably deserves 3 1/2 stars."
2,"Fahrenheit 451, a review of","Fahrenheit 451 is an unusual book about an alternate future. In this book, firemen have to start fires instead of putting them out. But they don't just randomly burn down peoples houses. They burn down the ones in which people have books; you may by thinking why would they care about books. Well, in this alternate future, books are illegal. I bet that this seems very ironic to you, but yes, it is a book about there being no books. I didn't like this book. I felt that that his writing style was very unusual. The author, Ray Bradbury, didn't have difficult sentences, but he did seem to jump around. He would never be very clear. Within each and every page he would jump around, or lose the readers attention by rambling on in an unorthodox style. If there were a prime age group for this book it would have to be junior high schoolers to high schoolers. That is probably because it is about that difficulty and this alternate future may be the most appealing to this age."
3,Eh...its ok,This book was confusing at times...boring at other...down right cruel at other. This future society is messed up like forreal so if you into all the sci-fi drama dystopian world this book is for you.
2,There Are Better Dystopias Out There,"This book was hard to read from the start. Eventually one can infer what is going on, but very little is explained plainly. The copy I read was from the library, and there were mispelled sticky notes throughout with what looked like two middle schoolers trying to figure out what was going on. (For instance, ""Why is Beatty ask about the dog? Dose he know where the books are?"")The ending is alright, and I really liked the quote about how the inability to build creates a need to destroy."
2,A bit on the iffy side . . .,"I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for class in eighth grade, and from the beginning, I knew this book would turn out be quite eloquent and philsosphical, but also extremely tedious. I almost fell asleep in some occasions. Bradbury does a good job describing sections in the story, but sometimes gets carried away and forgets about some mood. For example, when the city is bombed, there should be some line of chaos and the people inhabiting the city running for their lives. In conclusion, I struggled through the book and only read it out of coercion. I would never read this again."
2,Fahrenheit 451 - Not worth it,"This book is boring. Unless you are interested in science fiction or Ray Bradbury's work you probably wont like it. This book takes place in the future in a world where all books are banned. People spend a lot of time watching television. Montag, the main character is a firefighter who burns books. The story of the book is ok but it gets boring and there is no excitement. The book is easy to read and there isn't any very hard vocabulary. Don't read this book if you are in fourth grade or younger because it might be to hard to read, just stick to the movie if you are interested in this topic."
3,Fahrenheit 451,It is a great book but you have to really understand what going on in the story others why you can get lose during reading it!!
3,I liked this book,"The whole concept of this book bothered me. It made you think about other people persepctive, but the idea of book burning was something that was hard for me to get through when reading this book."
3,Okay- but not the best futuristic book.,"So, I ordered this book after consistent protesting from my fiance that this was fantastic. Maybe it was a combination of how high he had built it up, or the fact that I was never forced to read this when I was in school, but it did not impress me. It was an OKAY book, I am just was not overly impressed. Plus, I feel kinda cheated that I had to pay so much for it, compared to other Kindle books. Overall, I would recommend it if you are very interested in futuristic works, but otherwise, it is not the best read."
4,Great Book,"This is a great book. I loved it because it was so confuseing. I bet that is hard to believe, but I love confuseing books alot. If you a good book to read, read F451"
5,One of a kind masterpiece!,This is a marvellous book. I found it full of compelling text and did not want to put it down. I recommend this book to anyone whom likes a good can't put down book.
4,Relevance to our times,"""Fahrenheit 451"" a metaphor on the freedom of speech. It is not in literary terms that knowledge can be controlled by burning books; there are other ways to accomplish that. As the world is full of people; running with lit matches. Ray Bradbury is basing his attack on every editor; censor; lobbyist; government that see themselves as the caretaker of knowledge and literature; and they control by shackle the words of an author who dare to speak out.The question is very relevant to present times. The news is splattered with stories of doctored intelligence documents; on the bases of which dreaded events occurred."
4,Not afraid to think,"Bradbruy creates a world of censorship and what is supposed to be simplistic and fun. The main character, Guy Montag has the profession of a fireman, and rather then put out fires, he begins them. His job is to destroy books, but he soon realizes that there is more to the world than what is told to him. With the help of some very interesting supporting characters Montag's life is drastically changed. This is a really quick read under 200 pages. It was definantly thought provoking and the whole message fits in any time period."
3,A book that you need to read at least twice to understand,"When I first read this book, I was so incredibly lost. It was the first Bradbury book I'd ever read, and I guess I just wasn't used to his style. There were so many times I would have to reread 5 or 6 pages 3 or 4 times because I was so confused about what was going on. The characters were strange, and I couldn't ever tell what side they were on;it was really unpredictable. It's one of those books where you need to sit down and read it in a quiet atmosphere and focus on Bradbury's symbolism all throughout the book. If you miss the symbolism, you won't get much out of the book. I think it's hard for people under 13 to really understand some of the symbolism that's in the book, so there's really no purpose in them reading the book, since they won't understand it."
4,One of Bradbury's best,"I rarely read SF, I'm more of a fan of general fiction books like Prince of Tides or The Triumph and the Glory. But I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for a class and actually enjoyed it. It had an aura of chilling prophecy, the world may well deteriorate to conditions like that described in Bradbury's classic book, where books are burned. I hope not, though, Amazon would lose even more money than they are now."
5,I'm a big fan of Bradbury,I think his writings are amazing. I know many differ on that opinion but I truly enjoy his works. 451 is my favorite of his writings. I think it is fascinating to see how much the time influenced him. How so many things you see in the movie are now in creation like the wall tv (our flat screen now). This book was required reading in my youth and I feel it should be required today as well. It's a view of a world which could easily occur if we allow our rights to be flushed basically. How we could easily fall into a dystopian world if we become complacent and lack knowledge. I highly recommend this book!
3,I wouldn't burn this book,"There really is not need to review this book as everyone pretty much knows what its about and there are so many other reviews. The reason I don't love this book is that really its more of an idea book. I mean its a book you read and think you're a bit smarter for reading it. And on many levels that would be enough because most books have nothing to offer. Only thing is, this book isn't so much fun to read. Its more of a book that should have just been a short story."
4,Interesting dystopia,"In the world presented by Mr. Bradbury, books are illegal and all books here are from older times, people now hide and hoard them, and if someone is caught with books, their house is set on fire by firemen - the very same people that once prevented fires instead of starting them. Spare time is spent watching TV instead of reading, and the TVs are huge, taking up an entire wall. Some people try to have a TV room (TVs on all walls) for total immersion, which is what the main character's wife wants even though they cannot afford it all. Rather eye-opening and a appropriate commentary on books vs TV."
1,I DON'T UNDERSTAND...,I AM A FRESHMEN AND I WAS REQUIRED TO READ THIS BOOK.I AM ON PAGE 29. I DON'T GET A WORD I HAVE READ. I FEEL LIKE I'M READING IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. MABY IT'S BECAUSE I'M YOUNG.OR BECAUSE I'M ONLY ON PAGE 29.ALL I KNOW IS THAT I'M LOST.I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO REVIEWED THIS BOOK. YOU HAVE HELPED ALOT.
1,Painful listening,"Ray Bradbury was a fantastic WRITER. I wish he would have stuck to his strengths. Choosing to read this book himself for the audio recording was a tremendous mistake. His speech is, at times, nearly unintelligable (He was over 80 years old at its recording). What should have been a wonderful audio book ended up being a complete chore to listen to. Writers of films know enough to cast proffesionals to act-out their visions. Writers should be no different. Do yourself a favor, read the book yourself."
1,The Worst book I have ever read!!!!,This book was horribly written!! It confused more than it enlightened!!! I did not enjoy it at all and I never plan to read it again.
1,Wrong book sent!,I ordered a book for my grandson's school summer reading program. The book was supposed to be Fahrenheit 451 and I received a totally different book. I returned the book and by the time another book could be sent would be too late.I probably will not order from this site again.
4,"book, book, book","throughout the novel, you are exposed to many different thingS comparing to our world to this books words. the main character Guy is a firemen and his job in this world is to burn books that they find among the people. This book repersents the amount of learning that the people will be doing in the future of our county it tv will keep going as it is. the book is a good book it has the posibility of telling people what we will come to if we stop reading. There are factors that leading to the general lack of interest in reading and factors that make people actively hostile toward books. Nature is presented as a force of innocence and truth with one of the characters.Blood appears throughout the novel as a symbol of a human being's repressed soul or primal, instinctive self. Montag often feels his most revolutionary thoughts welling and circulating in his blood. thsi book kept me interested un till the end because you did not know what crazy thing was goin to go on next."
3,Difficult to understand,"This book was read in my Sophomore English class, I liked it, but I only understood it after my teacher's explanation. I recommend this book to people who like sci-fi, because the things that I didn't get, were futuristic things from the author's imagination. Once you actually get a picture in your head of what these futuristic things look like, the book is really good, and the author makes a very good point. I only give it three stars because the author doesn't describe the unknown things better to the reader."
4,The Firemen of Tomorrow,"The Firemen of tomorrow do not put out fires anymore..... they START them. This story about a fireman doubting his job is absolutely riveting. Guy Montag thought he was happy. Then a girl named Clarisse came onto the scene. Her sudden disappearance and/or death leads to his unsettlement. When his wife, Mildred turns him in, he must burn his own house. He finds hope with a group of shabby old professors. Ray Bradbury must have been psychic to write a book that hits this close to home. Who knows, Fahrenheit 451 may be the future. This book is a MUST for children to read in the classroom."
3,Farenheit 451 was aight,"I thought Farenheit 451 was a good book. It takes a while to get to the point though. It just starts of a little slow thats all I Mean. I really enjoyed the description done by Bradbury in the book his detail was very distinct. In the first half of the book the main character Montag a firefighter trys to discover himself. After all a firefighter starts fires in this story, and that might get to a person after a while. He wants to know why firefighters are supposed to burn books and why books are so bad.In the second half of the book Montag starts to use his head and stop letting everyone else control him. He becomes a fugitive and this is where the action begins. He ends up being chased by mechanical dog's and hellicopters and gets in fights with flamethrowers. I think that sais it all for the second half of the story. The soft Sci-Fi novel was very interesting and gets you thinking. I enjoyed it alot and hope everyone else gets a chance to read it and post their opinion."
3,not a book of points,This book starts of kind of dull. We are introduced to a fireman named Guy Montag a fireman that sets fires not one that puts them out. His wife Milly more in love with T.V family the Montag Montag meats a young spirited girl named clarrisa who is in love with the world. The book goes on saying how books are important and you lose interst fast.
2,451 review by Jessica C.,"when i read Farenheit 451, my first impression was that this book is so screwed up. i mean like who would want to not read a book. thats just so wrong. the one thing i did like about the book was Guy's wife, Mildred. i liked her alot because she said that the t.v was her family. she was a little crazy though. i also liked the part where she called the firemen and told them that Guy had books. then she walked out on him. i also liked the mechanical dog. that was something very original. i gave the book 2 stars because i really thought that it was a waste of time to read it. but you know, that is only my impression of the book.Writen By:Jessica C."
2,Fahrenheit 451- Somewhat a flop,"I didn't really care for this book. Fahrenheit 451 is not far-fetched though. I think some of the material mentioned in this book really could happen in the future if we let it. This is a fairly good book overall, but I'm rating it a 2 out of 5 stars because I was just confused. I am a freshmen in high school and my whole Literature Pre-AP class had to read Fahrenheit 451 for an assignment. Now I know what you're probably thinking, well of course it's going to be confusing for a freshmen. But, I beg to differ. This book is written good I suppose, but the story jumps around too much and certain parts come up and it is just plain confusing (i.e. Dentham's Dentifrice). Well that is about all I have to say about this novel. I'm sure if I read it over again I would enjoy it more. But I don't think this book would be much more than 2 or 3 stars."
4,The message is clear,"The message in the book is similar to that in ""1984"" and in the writings of Ayn Rand. At times the message seemed to be so ""in your face"" and I'm certain that Mr. Bradbury would have been more subtle had he written it 10 or 15 years later."
3,"Prophetic, but Immature","This was one of my favorite books in high school, and reading it again had a certain charm, but my issue with it can be summed up in a small quote from an interview included in the final pages.""DEL RAY: In the introduction to the recently published Bradbury: An Illustrated Life"", a wonderful book which I have spent hours immersed in--RAY BRADBURY: Isn't that an incredible book?""I had the same issue with Brave New World. Even though these science fiction romps are interesting and at times exciting, the authors are so in love with themselves and their prophetic ideas, it hurts; sometimes it even cramps the writing. The ham-fisted emotions of Guy Montag are bizarre and nonsensical to say the least--the other characters suffer a similar sort of cartoonishness.I do see why it's such a great book for high schoolers though."
3,My opinions on Fahrenheit 451,"My name is Karina and this review is for my pre-ap summer project for Jarman Middle School. I thought this book was every interesting to read.I did kind of think that some of the future idea where a little weird.But over all the story plot was great.I wouldn't recommend this to people my age.Why not? Well, as much as I enjoyed it on some parts I had a little trouble focusing. Also I sort of didn't understand some of the text.Now these are some of my opinions and other people may have liked it alot."
4,A novel about fireman who are paid to set books ablaze,This book was very interesting to read. This was my first time reading about the issue of censorship. I had recently wrote an essay about censorship and with the help of this book clearly made it easier for me to understand the issue better.
4,"Overrated. Only ""half"" as good.","I thought this book was going to be great since it is always on the teachers' lists of recommended readings. But I felt the story went a bit slow for me. The first half of the book, was not very interesting and it was a little confusing. But in the second half of the book the story really picks up. I would only recommend this book to people who like science fiction."
2,Fahrenheit 451,I first read this book in my L.A. class at school. This book has many meanings tied into it. Fahrenheit 451 is different then what I usally read. This book has so many hidden detals in it. In this book I can acutally see our world now ending up like the world in this book. The author of this book was brillant to make up a world like this. The main character Montag was great I could realt to him and put myself in his shoes that's what I like so much about this book. If I didn't read this book in class I probably would never read it.Hi Ms. O!!!!
2,Fahrenheit 451,"Fahrenheit 451 is a book is filled with action and suspense. If you like a book that has many twists and turns, then you'll enjoy this book by Ray Bradberry. He tried to write about what he thought would be the worst future, with no books. They would set books onfire, because to read and poses a book is unlawful. The people believed that books made people upset, think up different ideas, and unequal. The firefighters we know now would set things on fire, not put out the fire like they do now. This book is fairly easy to understand, middle schoollers should be able to understand the vocabulary."
2,Fahrenheit 451 review,"The book, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is a perfect example of a science fiction book. This book is about the life of a fire fighter named Guy Montag who lives in a futuristic city where books are banned. The job of fire fighters in his view of the future are to set books and the houses they are hiding in on fire. The reasoning for this is that books are said to be evil and contain many different thoughts and emotions that are considered ""dangerous"" if people are exposed to them. This book pretty difficult to read based on its challenging vocabulary and its confusing situations. I would recommend this book to people no younger than 7th grade based on the content of the book, and I would recommend it to people with a strong interest in science fiction and futuristic books."
2,Expectations,"Not being a passionate Science Fiction reader, I did not enjoy Bradbury's writing ideas and form. I found this book to be a very slow read, not moving very fast. Some of Bradbury's ideas did not seem to fit into the story. I found this story to be too far into the future to relate to. I found the action of burning books to be very unreal in any society. I have read some other stories from Bradbury and part of one of his other books, Dandelion Wine, and Fahrenheit 451 did not match up to some of Bradbury's other works."
4,Amazing book!,"I got this book to read as a part od the Nerdfighter summer book club, and I am so glad that I bought it. This book is amazing. It is incredible to think that this book was written over 50 years ago and Ray Bradbury pretty much predicted the decrease in book sales and increase in television viewers. This book is awesome and one of the best books I have ever read. It has completely changed the way that I read books and has increased my appreciation for the written word. I highly recommend this book to every single person who is able to read honestly."
4,Superb!,"This is an amazing book. I decided to read it when I found out that Mr. Bradbury had passed away.Even though it's supposed to be fiction, it seems way too familiar, since unfortunately there are so many people who prefer wasting their lives doing unimportant things rather than spending their time reading.I highly reccomend it."
5,"Sweet, sweet irony","The irony of this book always slayed me. Here is a book of a future where books are like drugs: outlawed, sold on the black market, and if there's a ""library,"" firemen destroy it. And the added bonus is that the main character, a loyal fireman, has a library! The irony that gets me is that this book is about banning books, yet it is a banned book, so nobody read it! (Ha ha, just kidding folks!)"
4,Great BUT hard to follow.,"This is amazing, all predictions and foreshadows came true in our present day lives. Amazing story a must read."
4,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,This book is powerful and interesting. It is the future and books are outlawed. Opinion isn't allowed and people are all brainless. In this book a man named Montag must go against the rules and break the law to do what he feels is right. It is indeed a spooky book about a dark future.
4,READ THIS NOVEL,I am an avid reader and Ray Bradbury's idea of a book burning society is amazing. I believe this is a must read for 8th graders and up. I was forced to read this book and I am happy i read it!
4,An Excellent Novel About The Dangers of Conformity,"I had to read this book for my H.S. freshmen english class and enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Bradbury uses a lot of good symbolism in connection with the theme of the novel. I realized that understanding these symbols and reading more into the novel is a necessity for a full understanding of the text and Bradbury's message. On the first quiz my teacher gave me, I got a 70%, but after reading more deeply into the novel (and taking some marginal notes to study from), I received a 100% on the next quiz. Unfortunately, when you look at our society today with all the ignorance, technological advancements, and anti-intellectual behavior practiced by many, you realize that it may end up a dystopia just like the F-451 society in the near future."
5,Philosophical,"This book should not merely by its face value. It is a ""good"" book on its plot and development alone. Its insight into life, however, knocks it up a step. It is very profound and warns us of an ignorant, entertainment society."
3,New take on the technology's influence on our lives.,"If I had not been required to read this book for one of my college courses, I probably never would have picked it up. But now after having read it I see the importance of it. It forces the reader to look at the effect that technology has on our lives and what direction this increasing technolgy could lead us. The plot is interesting and mind opening. The story would have had a stronger impact had Bradbury left the main character, Guy Montag, mentally stable at the end of the novel. I felt,as the reader, that his craziness led to a unreliablity in his character and his actions. This unreliablity in his character left the novel with a weak ending, instead of a strong one."
4,Fahrenheit 451,"Fahrenheit 451 is a book about a man named Montag. His occupation is being a fireman. When this book takes place, which is in the future, the firemen are making fires for books instead of extinguishing fires. Montag meets a girl that's new to his neighborhood and he walks her home. On the way, he finds out that her name is Clarrise Mclellen. He also found out that she was quite peculiar. Clarisse asked questions like if he was happy."
4,A good sciene fiction novel on human nature,"This book does a fine job at creating a dysfunctional, brainwashed American society of the future completely controlled by a dictator-like government. The story is easy to follow and has the moral of never lossing hope when everything around you feels lost. The book doesn't have too much deep meaning behind it, which means it basically reads out how it reads out. Ray Bradbury is a good author of these types, and provides interesting scenarios for these characters."
4,Good Read,"I have read this book more than once, when I first read it I had to for school but really enjoyed it. I read it again and even watched the movie, the book is way better. Very good message for those that think books are bad and useless. Books remind us of the past and can help us in our day to day lives."
4,Prophetic censorship,An interesting story of book censorship and the consequences of mankind if we allow this to get out of had. This version of the book has an interview with the author at the ned which I really enjoyed reading.
3,"In the words of Homer Simpson ""Good, but not Great""","When I was handed my copy of this book I thought that it was going to be up there with ""1984"" and ""A clockwork Orange"" ""Lord of the flies"", that sort of thing. But I was mistaken. The book was kind of shallow at times and left me thinking ""there should be more to this"" but there was not. The whole book I was waiting for something big to happen, but nothing ever did. The book did however have some good points. Bradbury has an odd writing style that I'm not a big fan of. That is why, it got 3 stars from me."
2,it was one of the worst novels i have ever read,it was very boring and i did not lik it at all. it lacked a basic plot and character development. i was very disappointed with the novel and with Bradbury.
2,it was okay,"I had to read this book for school, and at first I hated it. The beginning chapter is hard to understand because of all the symbolism, however, it eventually gets better. (slowly) It is easy to miss some concepts if you don't read slowly enough. I felt that the ending was far-fetched and boring. I did enjoy reading about a dystopian society, but altogether, the book is tedious and slow-moving."
2,Profoundly unfulfilling.,"Another dark, gloomy, mildly confusing, Blade Runner-ishview of the future lacking in any redeeming qualities.""In the future, Firemen burn books"" -- Bradbury createsan inventive premise but his own gloom overtakes the story.Fraught with loose ends, this is the last book you readbefore you set yourself on fire."
3,One of the Classics,I really enjoyed this book. One of those amazing stories that you see reflected in so many other stories today. My only complaint is that the writing style to me felt like I was reading one long runon sentence. Amazing read none the less. :)
5,451,This was a fantastic book. Felt like the quality and price were fair as well. I would recommend this book.
1,"Terrible, Terrible Book!","Bradbury is a good writer (I'll give him that), but I HATE his writing style. He starts making huge long mini-stories within the main story that has no point and is useless. He could have written this book in 50 less pages, and it might've gotten 2 stars. I think this is a terrible book, no offense to anyone who likes it."
3,great thinker,"This book was extremly boring! True it says a lot about how our future could be. You can also see that it is actually starting to happen in todays society. But this is our own fault for giving into the new technology. All of what I have read it seems you rate the book on how it can tell the future. If the rating was on that I would give it an 8. But that's not the case. This was a great thought processing book but not very well written. I advice children to stay away because they would become very disinterested fairly fast. If you love to think, understand how to interpret symbolic meanings, and loves science-fiction GO FOR IT!!!"
5,Quite an achievement,"I read this book as an assignment when I was 11 or 12, I believe. The reason I write this is because all the moronic kids who were ""forced"" to read it seem to think it sucks; well, let the record show that not *all* schoolchildren are idiots who must interpret every line of every book literally. I was duly impressed by the book even in 7th grade (?) and it gets better the older I get. The fact that I, an impoverished (well, you know what I mean) teenager, am willing to pay double the price of the book for a signed copy says something."
5,The best book in the world,If you haven't read this book you have to do so now. I know you are thinking its science fiction but once you read it you'll be thinking how can they burn books and kill people who do. You will agree bradbury's ideas. I hope a movie comes out of this book eventhough bradbury doesn't like it.Maybe the book can be remember by a movie.
4,Well-written Science Fiction,"Very well-written science fiction from 1950. Despite being written before the explosion of modern technology, Bradbury's book-burning story makes many timeless observations about censorship and the suppression of original thought and personal interaction.Bradbury's seashells as earbuds and the parlors with surrounding interactive screens are hardly a stretch to imagine if you have ever competed with an iPod or a flat screen for another person's attention.SPOILER ALERTDespite many hopeless characters and some violent destruction, the ending is optimistic as Montag and his hideout professors devise a way to preserve the classics."
2,"If you are a high school student, this would be a stunner...","If you are a high-school student, this would be a stunner, but to anyone with a little more life experience and a shred of political awareness, the book comes across as dated, patronizing and condescending."
1,Painful to listen to,Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read but deadly to listen to on the CD. Ray Bradbury reads in expressionless monotony. I tried to listen to the first CD five times and finally gave up. Stick with the book where you can supply your own voices.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Watch tv, sheeple.In the future, books are banned, and drugs and the good old electronic screen are used to keep the population docile and uninformed. Firemen don't put out fires here, they burn books when they are found, in a big macho showy way. One such bloke begins to have doubts about his occupation and society, and breaks away."
2,Dated screed,"I am frustrated by the sloppiness of this book. From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all. I do not understand why this work is lauded as a classic."
2,Fahrenheit 451,"This book is pretty good, except it is definitely very advanced. It was very confusing, especially the ""TV family"" which I did not understand at all. It is more of an adult book."
2,Fahrenheit %0ZERO0%,"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray BradburyI didnt really like this book, it was all just people rambling on and on about how there life sucks, the whole worlds sucks, and burn books. I dont know how you could enjoy this book. People just talk to talk in this book. Its about a guy named montage that is a firefighter. He burns things instaed of putting fires out. He meets a wierdo girl who talks nonsense, this guy starts to think what hes doing starts reading books and gets caught. He then has to burn his books. He doesnt want to go to jail so he Runs away."
2,"Boring, boring, boring","I struggled through this book. If I hadn't had to read it for school, I would have dropped it immediately. The story is dark and unhappy, and the writing style is so flat and boring. It seems as though the author is trying to use big flowery words and stuff, but it doesn't work at all. This is a horrible book."
1,BURN THIS BOOK!,"Hey A reader from MISSOURI, I hear you. This book makes no sense what so ever and i had to read it for school. I have no idesa just how in the world a book this horrible could have stayed around for 40 years!!! I have talked to everyone I know and they all read the first 5 pages and immeadiatly hated it. THey rented the movie and watched some of it so they won't have to read it, and it was verbatum, and guess what...it was even worse than the book! I do reccomend this book to all of you...well only if you want to find out how terrible books can get or you want to find out what type of flammable liquid burns better on books!"
2,more a name then a real book,"this is very dissapointing, cause after all i heard about the book i thought it suppose to be a masterpiece, but after reading it i discoverd that the writing is very poor, the story is bery weak, and the plot is dull.i think the book lost most of it's taste - a similat book like 1984 is more prefferd to read."
2,A bit on the dull side,"Bradbury has set forth some interesting ideas and prophecies in this book but as far as entertaining and suspensful goes I would give it about an ""F"" grade. It squeeks two stars."
3,OK,"I had to read this book for school. I know it has been marked a classic, but i found it incredably boring and a overdone. I thought it was overrated. I can read trashy entertaining books, but i also read classics. I only like to read the trash, or the entertainment when i know its trash or entertainment. I found the characters in the book shallow (Like Clarisse) and under developed. It was too bland and meaningless for what people make of it. And the phoenix metaphor at the end? That was a chiche. I wouldn't say this is a bad book, i mean its fairly well written, but i found 1984, which had a similar cautionary note to it and was also a Dystopian novel much more meaningful."
1,this was horrible,This book is one of the worst I have read!! Classic or not it still was bad!!! I had to read this for school and I hated it! It was soo simple. Only one thing happens in the entire book and that one thing isn't even exciting!
1,Awful,I read this book and i hated it. Don't waste your money on it. It will ruin any respect you have for books. Three words: DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!
1,WASTE OF MY TIME,"first of all i was assigned to read this book for a class. it started out lame. and all it did was get worse. who cares about a firefighter who burns book. now come on, i could write a book, about books,ten times better then that. maybe if the books had names and talked then maybe it would of caught my attention."
1,This is the lamest book I have ever read,This book really sucks. It makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time. Ray should have had better things to do
1,Burn it!,"I'm no advocate of book burning, but burn this book! It was terribly disappointing--lots of hype over a cheesy science-fiction novel. There are two major problems with it. One is poor language usage--lousy descriptive word choices, lousy metaphors and similes that make inappropriate comparisons--and two, not enough attention paid to societal problems that give rise to things like book burning in the first place: the threat of the individual to the group; government control over the sheep-like masses; the modern epidemic of people's lack of interest in anything intellectual; the timeless epidemic of a fear of anything that goes against group mentality or upsets the status quo, and so on. Bradbury touches on some of these issues, but leaves them largely undeveloped."
1,"Hip Hop Uncensored, Vol. 7: Hustle On",i purchased this thinking it was a music video dvd which it is not its more of a documentry with no videos
4,supertoy,Now this is not just a toy for the boys. Girls can have hours upon hours of fun with this handy dandy little toy. This shoots fun missle shaped foam darts so any girl can pretend to be megaman's sister Roll. She is so cool by far the best charicter yet.
2,Remember: there's no DRANO for the brain-o (beware!),"If you want a sick, disgusting, perverse movie, look no further. You've found it.One word: Feh!In NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR, glum Jehovah and amused Beelzebub sit opposite each other in a train's dining booth. Three repulsive stories are presented in-between performances from an early-Madonna influenced pop band, complete with breakdancing vocalist. Ancient spectral black conductor and porter inexplicaby shuffle between cars. Visuals in the first segment alone include lobotomy, amputation, heads preserved in jars of formaldehyde and hanging body parts. Lots of booby shots for ogling snuff perves. (grabs some filth-removing eyewash)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(2.7) Night Train to Terror (1985) - Richard Moll/Cameron Mitchell/John Phillip Law/Marc Lawrence/Ferdy Mayne/Tony Giorgio/Earl Washington/Gabriel Whitehouse"
4,terror train,"Riding on the coattails of movies such as Halloween, I found terror train to be head and shoulders above most of the early 80's slasher flicks. Its really too bad that most video stores don't carry this anymore. Fans of Jamie Lee Curtis' scream queen days won't be disappointed."
3,scary and very bloody,"the movie Night Train to Terror is very violent bloody, and scary. There is no menu start on this movie,just insert in dvd player and the movie begins. It is very scary and unpredictable."
3,A blast for true B fanatics,"If you've ever wanted to tell a friend ""You've gotta see this. It's horable yet straingly compeling"" Night Train to Terror was made for you. It is one hour and thirty minutes (give or take) of non-stop B movie humor. It shars a level of ha ha suckyness shared only by aclaimed films such as ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and ""Philidelphia"" OH sorry about that ""Philidelphia wasn't a B movie."
3,Lacks variety,"This is a really well done album, but it lacks variety between the songs. If you are not paying attention, you will not even notice when one song ends and the next one begins. That being said, the music itself is beautiful. I have a very hard time understanding the lyrics, between the singing style and the accent, so that makes it hard for me to connect emotionally to the songs.J.Ja"
4,Powerful and riveting drama,"An amazing all star cast show off serious acting chops in a dark drama/thriller told in segments and concentrating on different points of view and experiences revolving around the death of a young woman. Harrowing, moving, and suspenseful, the films draws a sudden and suprising conclusion that is both realistic and shocking. A great character piece that paints complicated portraits of its character both both good, bad, and neurotic. I would describe the film as being very dark but told with such conviction and lack of heavy handiness that it's also very entertaining. Toni Collete as always gives an incredible performance alongside quasi walking legend Piper Laurie, Mary Steenburgen, Giovanni Ribisi, Kerry Washington, and many others including stand out performances by an amazing Mary Beth Hurt and a right on target Brittany Murphy (nobody does almost-insane and/or drugged out better than her). A good film elevated by an amazing cast and inspired performances."
5,Excellent!,"It's definitely one of the best movies I have seen in the past 5 years. Amazing performances, great cast and story."
2,Dark and dreary,"A dead girl is found in a field and that leads us to several stories that kind of involve her. Each one is dark and dreary and slow. Toni Collette and Piper Laurie reinact Carrie in the first segment which adds nothing to the film. Actually only the ""Wife"" and the ""Dead Girl"" seem really worth watching and both of those are very dark and again slow and dreary. Lots of good people in this, but no real mystery or suspense. Really just kind of depressing and that's does not make for entertainment. The real world is depressing enough."
4,the dead girl,"I'll admit that I only bought this movie because James Franco was in it. I do enjoy his looks, but he is a strong actor that has intrigued me over the years. That being said, his part wasn't the biggest, nor was it the best. He did the best he could with the part given, but his segment (the movie is divided into 5 segments) was mainly focused on Rose Byrne's story. She gives an excellent performance, likely the best in the film.The 4 remaining performances, all centered on women, are held together by strong female performances. I found Toni Collette's part to be the most emotionally touching, and Brittany Murphy does a good job as well. She was a bit over indulgent at times, but I have always admired her acting skills. This movie was no exception.Overall, the movie was pretty depressing. The story was moving and engrossed me, but I can't say that I would recommend it unless you are a die hard fan of one of the actors. The plot is interesting, but the acting is the real story."
3,The dead Girl,I didn't realize I had this movie already. But I actually bought it because of the recent death of Brittany Murphy and wanted to have a reminder of her through her movies.
4,somber but well done,"This movie is definitely not for everyone. It presents a dark, disturbing reality that left me moved and haunted for several days. The movie is so well made, though, in just about every theatrical aspect, that I have to rate it highly. I usually don't care for a movie that is presented in segments or chapters, but this movie's form of storytelling is masterfully accomplished at the hands of its director. Acting performances are outstanding. I walked away with both a lot of emotions and a lot to ponder after seeing this picture...a sign of excellence in my book. Just don't view this if you are looking for something light or uplifting."
4,Provocative,"When I rented this movie I didn't realize it was the stories of different women and how one murder links them all. It begins with Toni Collette as a shy caretaker of an abusive old woman. When she finds the body of the murdered woman she is shocked and fascinated. She realizes that life is too short to be sitting in one place letting other people make you feel worthless and she acts. The movie continues with the ME preparing the body. The ME thinks that the dead girl could be her missing sister. Her life and that of her family has been frozen since her sister went missing. Her parents won't accept that their daughter might be dead. This weighs heavily on their remaining daughter who only wants to get on with her life, but this obsession with finding her sister overwhelms her. We also get to meet the dead woman's mother, her roommate, and the dead girl herself. I've never seen a movie quite like this and I found it an interesting character study and mystery."
5,The Dead Girl (DVD),I really like this movie. It is one that I would stronglyrecommend to my friends and all good movie buffs. It is bestthe first time you see it as there are surprises in it thatyou don't want to know before you see it. Watch this movie.
3,Average. More like a 2.5,"I think this is a fine film in some respects, but I didn't care for it. I won't dissuade people from watching and deciding for themselves. Go check it out at the library. Don't buy it.The characters in The Dead Girl were just too pathetic and unhappy. No one can relate to these people; well I couldn't.I saw Lantana before seeing this, so perhaps that's why I wasn't terribly impressed with this movie.I wish we wouldn't have bought it. We won't watch it again."
1,"Vile, all too Vile, all too stooopid","That's N-i-e-t-z-s-c-h-e, and what he wrote bears no relation to this movie.In this stinker, all the men seem like predators, or are unappealing at best, all the women are victims. If this is reality--the reality of L.A. or anywhere, I want no part of it. In my experience, people from most classes have some kind of spark or charm. This is a film that mistakes vileness and vapid, blank suffering for profundity or realism.Watch them suffer! On second thought, don't! The most unappealing group of people I've ever fast-forwarded through in recent memory--even worse than The Hawk is Dying.I like dark films--but this is just rub yer nose in it vile and stupid.Avoid at all costs! Yech!"
3,"Great Potential, But...","I eagerly anticipated watching this movie, and for most of its duration, it lived up to its billing.It jolts you from the start when a lonely caregiver stumbles upon the gruesome corpse of a young woman. The movie has segments which describe other women who are, in some way, linked to the victim. These segments are well-acted, poignant, but brief perspectives of each woman's life, and for a moment this looks like it might become one of the truly great movies of recent years. And then the end sort of leaves you hanging, and wondering. It feels as if the characters are seeking closure, and yet closure is not something you think of when the movie is over.This is the movie's only real flaw, though. It is beautifully scripted, written, and acted. Ah, if only..."
2,Poor Quality,"Two (2) of the the selections on this disc have static & skip, in fact, the 2nd one just stops after a while. The product is virtually un-usable."
4,Classic excellence from a great piano man,"One of the best....Ramsey Lewis's famous ""Wade in the Water"" which has been heard in countless film and TV spots truly is one a jazz fan will want in it's entirety."
4,where has ramsey lewies been all my musical life?,"It's rare that I can find a piece of music that can relax me after a long week and get me grooving at the same time. This CD does it. It also gets my 1 year old son shaking his nappy so strong is the rhythm. Familiar songs given a piano jazz working maybe an ignoramus' view but that's what it is. I am amazed this trio weren't hawked to me as part of a back catalogue release sooner. But this proves there are some musical gems yet to be re-released in the noughties. Ramsay, your public needs you - where are you?"
4,ramsey lewis finest hour,i have an old vinyl of the ramsey lewis trio from college days. it was fun to discover he is still around today (saw him in concert recently) & that i can get all kinds of cds of his wonderful music. i love his older music the best.
4,Excellent Piano Fair Accordian and Guitar,"I am listening to this right now. I bought it for Henry Gray. Mr.Gray is downhome. You have to like solid blues, his left hand isstraight boogie woogie, right hand Chicago after Big Maceo. I have been playing for 10 years now and this will be a solid addition to my collection of Maceo, Pinetop Perkins, Little Brother Montgomery, and Leroy Carr all my favorites. His voice is strong and clear and his songs good straighforward blues.The other guy on the album is Rudi Richard. He does guitar like somebody who is stuck in 1950. Sort of like a primitive Buddy Holly or Ventures. Not real creative but solid. I would give this album a ***** if it was just Henry Gray. All and all its good for dancing and like early rock and roll."
4,looks good,"I haven't tried this yet. But it looks good .. came in a cheap packing, maybe because its a OEM and also the fact that how much can you expect for $2. The shipping and handling were more costly than the actual item. Anyway as one of the review said, it is not different from what is shown on the website and I assume it will also work without any problem .."
4,Good value,This product was delivered by provider on time and the quality is better the original I bought directly from my cell phone provider and way cheaper! The only down side is that the cord is short so it is difficult to talk on the phone while it's charging (unless you are hands free).
1,low quality,the charger did work that is the only positive after one day the top broke off charger and the wires are exposed. I guess you get what you pay for..... low grade merchandise
4,Motorola Charger,"Great charger, works fine. Second one I bought but this one does not light up blue like the first one, it only has a small blue LED on the front."
3,Shipping Weight 3 pounds?,"I'm sure the product works fine, but shipping weight 3 pounds? I don't think so."
3,very good,"Not quite what I had pictured or quite like the OEM one I have. But none the less, gets the job done. Quick receipt."
4,Cood Customer Service!!,Ordered 2. One worked and the other didn't. Contacted Company who sent another at once. Got it i a few days and didn't have sent the broken one back. That saved me a lot of time. will do more orders with them in the future.
1,advertised as OEM??,"I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Clearly all 3 products are china knockoffs according to the counterfit guide that one finds on other motorola product pages, but conveniently left off this one. I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for. The battery however (also clearly a knockoff) held less of a charge than the one it was replacing. I asked for a replacement(OEM as advertised this time Please!) and another knockoff was sent. Im disappointed in AMAZON for this. I was told to return anything I was unhappy with. Ill lose out on shipping both ways.one star because it worked, and they lied.Motorola Counterfeit Identification Guidebook: Motorola, Inc."
4,Motorola car charger OEM?,"The car charger I ordered and got works great with my phone, but when I got it, it didn't look like the one the seller had pictured. He said it was on OEM. The one I received just had a small blue dot that lit up. The charger does look like it would be an OEM. I read from one seller that the one with the small blue dot was the newer model but I just checked the Motorola site and the one with the all blue glowing top is still the one they show. Reading a review by another buyer on another sellers site I found he had the same problem I did. So you may get the charger that is actually pictured and you may not depending on the seller. (Charger works great the reason for the 4stars and not 5stars is the charger did not look like the one pictured. If you really want what is pictured you may want to ask the seller if it is the one pictured, if you don't care what it looks like and just want one that works good then you can just order it)"
2,Counterfit item - but works OK,"According to the Motorola guide, the charger I received is a counterfit: It has a illuminated blue dot rather than a fully illuminated ""M"". It works OK, but should not be represented as made by Motorola."
5,It worked,Yep. Motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord. Has a convenient on off light that you'll never miss. It's big and bright.
5,Excited,"I am very, very pleased with the car charger. It came packed very well and in a very timely manner. The price was great compared to retail stores. No worries now when traveling long distances."
2,Great Value for the Money,"I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm. I don't expect it last forever so i purchased a couple of back-ups just in case. Each one of these Adapters failed after a couple months use, even light use. I would skip this one and seek another way to charge such as an using an inverter and home plug in charger. This year I switched to an iPhone."
5,Slick unit.,"Wish all chargers had coiled cords like this on has, stays out of the way. Very nice looking unit, well made and works great."
1,disappointed,"This product did not last two months. I brought it for emergencies and when I needed it, it wasn't working."
2,Not so good,"It works. That's the best I can say about it. The outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places, exposing wire after only a month. My phone is telling me that I am using an unauthorized charger. So no, this was not a good purchase, and I do not trust the source."
1,"Motorola Razr V3, V3i, V3c, Slvr L7, L6, L2 Pebl U6, V190, Mpx200, V360, V323, V325 - Ch710 OEM Original Auto Car Charger Syn084","I have been looking for this adapter for some time now and found it at Amazon.com. The price is great, arrived before schedule, in new condition but did not work in my car. Everything fit properly but it would not charge my phone - I did not notice an illuminated LED which would indicate power input. In all fairness, my cigarette lighter may be on the brink and therefore not transferring current/voltage; I doubt it though. I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with it.Maybe once I insert it into another vehicle, it may work. For now, this is it."
5,"Eye-opening, profoundly moving","Who are these people who beg by the side of the road? What has driven them to so desperate a measure as panhandling? How much money do they collect? Where do they go and how do they live when they are not on the streetcorners? While Bruce Moody's book cannot speak for all street beggars, it does provide a thoughtful and penetrating glimpse into the hidden world of the down and out. In reading this account, one must perforce give up the well-worn cliches and stereotypes about those inhabiting this netherworld. Moody's tale is one of raw adversity, yes, but also one of redemption. The kindness of strangers he encounted in one year is, I daresay, more than most of us will experience in a lifetime. ""Will Work For Food or $"" shines as a bright beacon of hope through the darkness of despair."
1,Boring,"As a longtime deer-lover, years ago I found a copy of this DVD at my local supermarket and bought it, thinking that I would probably love it. However, I was wrong. This is just another one of those boring movies featuring adorable animals that serve as the highlight of the entire film, but eventually over time their endearing qualities gradually start to recede in your opinion, leaving you to mindlessly sit through the remainder of the film. Not only that, but the fawn barely appears in the second episode on this DVD (only two cartoons are featured), and the cartoons are so old that you can hardly understand a word that anybody is saying."
2,Doesn't get to the meat of things,"I'm a huge fan of both the film and the author (check out his music!) but was pretty disappointed by this book. While Jaworzyn's choice of quotes (it's told 'oral histroy' style a la Please Kill Me, etc) certainly gives insight into things such as the process of making the film and the now legennadry financial fallout that followed, very little is told about the characters or the script. The detailed descriptions of what exactly went into filming border on the academic and may bore the bejeezus out of anyone who doesn't already have a background in filmmaking. There is very little information on the writing process - maybe it's just me, but I would have preferred to hear who inspired the Hitchhiker character, for instance, than read pages about foreign licensing and shady deals."
5,Wow! You gotta hear this!,"This entire album is great! In particular, ""The Chant of the Islands"" is a breathtaking song. Its what paradise sounds like.Do yourself a favor and purchase this album."
2,A somewhat annoying companion,"This book may be of value to someone who really knows Virgil and Virgilian scholarship, but Horsfall's style is so idiosyncratic, and his approach so random, that students and other intermediate readers are best warned off. Ideas are presented, or hinted at, in sentences or sentence fragments overflowing with parentheses, exclamation points, question marks, footnotes, and cross-references. The text is poorly edited and in places doesn't make any sense at all. Overall, one gets the impression that Horsfall (who wrote most of the book, and translated two chapters from Italian into his own idiom) is a brilliant scholar who welcomes us into his brain but really can't be bothered tidying up before we come in."
2,More About the Book,"BloodRune is written in a unique first-person present-tense that I've never seen in another book. This gives a very interesting perspective on the story itself when told as it's happening by the characters that are there. This book follows characters more than the plot, and that's reflected by a bit of a lack of direction to begin with but is tied together once the plot is worked up to. In much the same light, there's a fair amount of content to begin with that seems pointless at the time, mere plot filler, but much of that is explained once the plot starts to come into play. BloodRune ends with a dramatic twist, leading up to the series that was intended to follow. Unique characters, carefully placed humor, realistic plot development, and a very interesting perspective make this book worth taking a closer look. A free preview of two pages can be found at the publisher's site."
1,way to make the worst game of all time,"Thanks to the people at Vivendi Universal for making quite possibly one of the most horribly boring/glitchy/... games of my life. How could you take such a good story, and turn it into the most rotten expierence of my life. Was this game test played EVER before its release? Obviously not.... Let me list the pros and cons:pros:*now cons:-combat is few and far between and when it comes about it usually takes 45 minutes for the enemy to run at you, attack, then run back to its spot (awesome)-not only can your character go of the screen and get stuck, other NPC can do the same! (real sick)-equipping and sharing items only takes about 400 years of your life, forget about all your goals and dreams. This is way better.-the dialouge (like the game itself) seems to be written by children-the games ends in the mines because of a horrible bug in this awfuly designed game.I hope this review sways you from even playing this game..."
4,"Fun, but some bad points","This game is really fun! The graphics are wonderful,and the buildings and landforms are outstanding looking!But there are some badpoints.When you move your chracter He moves like a slug.The battle system is turn based.Its not melee like the two towers.If you liked the battle system in pokemon then you might like this battle system though.And this game freezes a lot.You could have goten very far and it would just stop!But the fact that you can play as all nine members in the fellowship is REALLY cool!So:Buy it if you like:Puzzels and Organized battles.Don't buy it if:You hate doing missions and thinking."
1,Horrific,ATTENTION!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I REAPEAT!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS BUGGY AND NO FUN WHAT-SO-EVER.THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
1,"Slow, buggy, and awful","I had high hopes for this game since I'm a big Tolkien fan and really like good GBA RPGs. Boy, was I disappointed! First off the game is horribly slow. Combat takes forever, and is boring since your character miss all the time. You'll spend hours walking around looking for mundane items like flowers or Pippen.Add to that fact that the game is horribly buggy. Gimli turns invisible in one quest, sometimes the elves don't give you items you need, and I've yet to meet anyone online who found a way out of Moria without the game crashing.Don't buy this waste of a game. Save your money and either wait for one of the other Lord of the Rings games coming out this Christmas (The Two Towers) or buy Golden Sun or Castlevania instead. This is a prime example of a great license going to waste."
4,"Glitches, Glitches and did I mention Glitches?","Well, the game is ok, as long as you don't want to finish it. Most of the game is just wandering around pointlessly to find things and getting lost a lot. The major problem is that at one point Gimli is invisible when you need to talk to him and the fact that every single game freezes up when you try to leave Moria. Other than that it's well.... ok for being Lord of the Rings merchandise."
1,A Slow Game with Terrible Glitches,"This game is more based on the book then any other lotr game. But the battles are terribly slow, some items don't work, things that the game promised are taken out, the graphics are awful, and there are some terrible glitches in the game, especially the Moria Glitch which made me go out buy another one (I thought the first one was a defect) and go through the same glitch again. Even if you are a huge lotr fan you should probably stay away from this game."
1,disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Tolkein books and lord of the rings especially. This was actually a pretty fun game for a while, I can't complain, I bought it in a bargain bin for $5 bucks, and I was thinking ""What am I going to lose?"" I lost 5 bucks and I want it back. I liked how it had aspects of the books instead of the movies in them, like Tom Bombadil and such. I would have more stars for it (1, mayyybe 2) if I didn't get stuck in Rivendell. I think I got Gimili's axe a step ahead of when I was supposed to and when I talk to him he says he needs it. Game over. There is nothing I can do to progress. And what really sucks is that I saved it before I knew that I was stuck. So its either spend another 3-5 hours replaying it and getting back to that part to progress, or quitting. I think I'll just quit and maybe sell it for a buck on Amazon."
1,"Might be okay, but glitches are doozies.","I could have made it through this game several x by now, but the glitches stuck me in trees in caves over drop-offs, etc., numerous times. I'm done... didn't even bother to finish and I was well past Morea. Someone said the ending sucks, so what am I missing anyhoo? I'll try the other two, heard they were better. I'm glad I logged on here to see the reviews (that perfectly match mine) or I might have gone out to buy another copy... thought this cartridge had been flushed and just stamped on the grahics glitches were so bad! But no they say, this game just stinks. Don't waste your money, borrow this one from a friend at the most and see what everyone means. Does not deserve the one point I had to give it."
5,Balrog!,"I am such a huge fan of author J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderful Lord of the Rings book trilogy and I must say that Fellowship of the Ring for the Game Boy Advance is a remarkable adaptation to Tolkien's book trilogy! But, beware of the glitches in this game! I got past them, but it wasn't easy. The game crashes in the Old Forest and the Mines of Moria levels. Other than that, this is a stunning game!"
5,The best game I have ever played. JoeF-k,"This is by far the best game I have ever played. You may get stuck in the Mines Of Moria ,but this game you won't be able put down! The frist time I played it I played for 7 hours strait!"
1,What a JIP!!!,"This is the worst LOTR game ever!!! It takes hours to figure out the damn forest, and a lot of other crap!! My brother bought itoff ebay, and only played it once. The graphics suk, the battle is turn based and slow, and it cost us 30 friken $$!!! Don't listen to the other reviews. This game sux. Buy Return of the King and forget about dis."
1,Pitiful game,This game has so many bugs I'm suprised it works at all. I can't even finish because of a glitch in the Mines of Moria. I wish I could get my money back.
4,chalinging game,"this game is hard and I still havn't beaten it, and I have had it for two mothes. I reconmend for only skilled players play.DELTA 904thanks for youre time and patience"
4,Not bad.,This game is definetly fun but make sure you rent it before you buy it! There are a couple of glitches but it can be fixed. If you like LOTR then look into this game. If you don't like LOTR you will think this game is a total mess! I love this game but see for yourself.
1,HORRIFIC,"ATENTION ALL PERSONS!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS NOT FUN.You'd think that they'd have music and the game does,until you make a move pretty much.Poorly designed,Buggy,You could go on and on about it's flaws. final grade F ...NOT BUY THIS GAME"
1,Horrible Game,"This game is boring. You can't follow the story line, and if I hadn't read the books I would not understand it at all. The fight scenes take too long and they are also boring. In the mines of Moria there is this one place where you have to go but you get stuck because the game has a bug. The controls are extremely weird and take a long time to get used to. I have bought this game and I do not like it. I would suggest not buying it."
3,I KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF MORIA!!1,"I WAS GETTING VERY UPSET THAT AT FIRST CAUSE I COULDN'T GET OUT OF MORIA AND I WAZ FROZEN....WELL THAT DOOR THAT FADES AWAY WHEN YOU WALK INTO IT WELL.....WHEN IT FADES YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE ""L"" BUTTON IMMEDIATELY AND IF THE CHARACTER BOX IS UP WHILE ITS STILL FADING YOU DID IT RIGHT SO FAR BUT WHILE ITS STILL FADING AND THE BOX IS UP PRESS ""A"".....YOUR NOT FROZEN ANY MORE...IT TOOK ME FOREVER BUT IT WORKS....I GOT THIS FROM SOMEONE ELSE..AND I JUST TRIED IT."
2,DO NOT BUY,"This is the worst Gameboy Advance ever I can not belive I wasted my money on this. Buy a good game like Golden Sun, Wario Land 4, Spyro season of ice, Crash Bandacoot, and Sonic Advance. If you buy it get it for a different gameing platform. Never buy a game after a book or movie for Gameboy Advance I bought Harry Potter for Computer and my friend bought it for Gameboy Advance and I was amazed at how much better the game was for computer. So I highly suggest that you do not buy this game for Gameboy Advance."
2,Fun for Fans,"As a Lord of the Rings fan i was excited about the upcoming Game be Vivendi Universal. You can play as any part of the company of the ring, from the first book, "" Fellowship of the Ring"". The game follows the book very well, but the gameplay is a different story. In many areas you get stuck and find that the only way to get out of being stuck is by restarting the game. If you are willing to play, and play to finish the game, then you might find this a good game. The graphic are alright compared to others and you may find that it seems to have a dark tint. If you are a fan of the book you will enjoy this game, if not, i sugjest finding a different game to play"
3,A Pretty Good Video Game,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a pretty good video game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance because it is addictive, has great game-play, and wonderful graphics! The only thing I do not like about this game is that it has glitches in it that make it freeze up. But, thankfully I found away to avoid the glitches. If you are a ""Lord of the Rings"" book trilogy fan then I highly recommend you buy ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance!"
1,The Buggiest Game I've ever seen,"Is this the same GBA ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings"" that was produced by Vivendi? Now it is said to be by ""Jack of All Games"". If this is the same cartrige, and it looks identical, this is the buggiest game I've ever seen. I have never even been able to get out of Rivendell, because Bilbo won't drop Sting, the Elves won't drop Gimli's Axe, and Gimli doesn't show up at the exit to get his axe. Unless these things happen you cannot leave Rivendel. I have played through to Rivendell twice, and it just gets stuck there. There are numerous other bugs as well, the game freezes in the house where you fight spiders, and when you enter the mines of Moria, although I have never even gotten that far. This would be a good game, if it worked. But it does not."
1,AVOID THIS GAME!!!,"I was shocked to find so many glitches in this game! Give me a break; shouldn't products like this be tested and retested? I am not even talking about the silly and useless actions I was forced to take to make certain events happen, I am talking about outright glitches! I totally gave up when I got stuck in Rivendell. I can't leave the place; the elves won't give me an item I need and there is nothing I can do except start over from the beginning. Forget that! I started Two Towers; it's much less boring and inane, and so far, no glitches."
3,Too many bugs,"You know, the whole plot of the game is good. Too many bugs though. Its really not a big deal the first 4 times but its get annoying the 6th time! Save your cash people! Dont buy it!"
1,"Sorry, try again","This ""book"" (40 pages, including the back cover as a page!) is very close to completely useless. Poorly organized, it does give some useful information, but it rarely puts it in a useful context. The very few drawings are of poor quality and tiny to boot! If you're looking for a start-to-finish process of how to side a house, as I was, this is NOT it."
1,Not very helpful,"I was hoping to find detailed instructions for selecting vinyl siding and installing accessories like soffits, trim, adding insulation, etc. I already know the basics of hanging vinyl siding. I found a lot of the instructions and many of the diagrams confusing. I found the FREE planning guides and installation instructions from the siding manufacturers more helpful. At $14.95 it is not worth the money."
2,"If you've played mario on N64, you're played this","Basically, if you ever played mario on the N64, you know what this game is going to be like. It's the same type of scenario where you do various things in each level to achieve stars (or hearts in the case of this game). The graphics are cool, but I just became bored due to the dejavue factor. I was dissapointed."
2,I'M OVER IT,"With.. Mario Sunshine, Metroid Prime, Star Fox, Zelda, & Wario World who's going to have time for this? Please ~Acclaim~ no sequels. Truthfully the first level was so boring I didn't care to go further. I know it reeks that you may have payed ~x~ amount of $'s for this game , but don't beat yourself up. Just brush it off and buy one of the other games I mentioned above. I can only give a few nods for good graphics, sound and idea. Hence the 2 stars."
4,love the convenience,"I have the Plantronics BlueTooth for my cell phone, so when I was looking for a headset for my desk phone I knew that style and size worked for me. The fact that there are different sized ear buds is the key, since everyone's ear is shaped differently. My only complain about this headset is the fact that even though I have made the adjustments stated in the book, sometimes I get an echoing sound (only on my end) when I am talking. This does not always happen."
1,Disappointing,"At first this headset worked well, then it began producing occasional feedback and echo sounds. Now, 14 months later, right after the warrantee expired, I've called support to be informed that the unit is bad and that a repair will cost about $150.Personally, I expect a lot more from a headset that cost over $300."
3,It's OK but not particularly comfortable,"I had this for a while and used it quite a bit. I work from my home and spend a lot of time on conference calls. It works well but I didn't find it particularly comfortable. I ended up giving it to my church for the receptionists to use. They're mostly in their 70s and couldn't figure out how to make it work since you have to push the button on the side and take the receiver off the hook, etc, etc. They stopped using it. I bought the binaural model of the headset and like it much more. It has the same issues with pushing the button (it will actually activate automatically when taken from the charging cradle) but you still have to take the receiver from the hook because my phone is not compatible with the automatic receiver lifter that is an option."
4,Good,"Our office bought 10 of them and all of them seem to work fine so far, except one, that stalls upon hookup, but seems fine now. Very good reception and clarity."
5,Great memories,My grandmother gave me this book when it was first published. I loved it then and I love it now. My grandmother lived in similar conditions and now I am too. Its a wonderful read. Full of laughter and smiles.
5,Who says Old Folks don't have fun,"I just saw this book at a yard sale, the title caught my interest and I am not sorry I bought it. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my Daughter-in law's birthday"
5,Elder adventure and northern California history,"I've read Dear Mad'm three times and am still amazed at the author's ability to transport me into the Klamath mountains. She skillfully paints a detailed picture of her late-in-life adventures amidst enchanting mountain forest life and people who take care of each other around the mid-1900s. You'll learn a lot about small-scale gold mining, the beautiful plant life of the area and the ability that one can have to change his or her destiny with the simple phrase of, ""I'm going to do it!"" I hope someone turns this into a movie!"
3,Dear Mad'm,"This is a fun read, written about a region with which I'm familiar. The fact that an elderly author penned this tome adds to its merit. I'm sure she, as well as her family, took pride both in the accomplishments she describes and in her publication of a book about them. Dear Mad'm makes great light reading."
4,basic living in the backwoods in the 1950s,"I read this book several years ago,and enjoyed it.I recently reread it after travelling from Yreka to Happy Camp,and realizing what a very remote and wild area it is now,let alone back in the 50s.I was impressed with the courage and physical fitness that the author had at the age of eighty.The book is written in a simple but interesting way.There are surprises throughout!"
2,BEWARE if you have a widescreen TV!,"What's the deal, slipping the fullscreen version of Stuart Little in with the widescreen version of Stuart Little 2 and mislabeling the package?! A 4:3 aspect ratio film should NOT be called a ""Deluxe Version"" when there is a 16:9 version available. I feel very deceived/taken by this, and am docking these otherwise cute movies 2 full stars for Studio Stupidity."
5,"Both Stuart Little 1 & 2 on one ""little"" PSP UMD Disc! WOW!",This is a great PSP UMD Video!!! Includes BOTH Stuart Little and Stuart Little 2 on one tiny PSP UMD!!! Two great family films!!! Will keep the kiddies(and adults too!)entertained for hours!!! Recommended!!! A+
2,The Adoption theme is problematic,"Adoptive parents should be aware of the problematic aspects of this movie for kids who were adopted. When Stuart's biological parents arrive on the scene and announce that they want Stuart back, his adoptive parents hand him over, no questions asked. There is no sense that adoption is permanent. If your adopted child sees this movie, be prepared to discuss it afterwards and assure your child this would never happen in real life."
3,Speed square not exactly as pictured,"There is really nothing wrong with this speed square, but the main reason I chose this one over others was the supposed black measurement markings, which I believed would make it easier and faster to read. Unfortunately, contrary to the product photo, the markings aren't actually black. They are simply etched/stamped into the square, with no coloring to highlight them. Consequently, just the opposite of what I was hoping for by choosing this particular speed square, it takes a bit more effort to read the markings."
2,Not standard size,This tool does not fit into my American made nail bags.The plastic seems really strong but i will never know cause i cant carry it.
4,Can't go wrong with Corcoran!,"Well made, great tread for walking in snow, sand and standing to work in all day long, I bought these for my partner and he stands at his job all day long and will only wear combat boots. His last pair of combat books were jump boots and the sole did not last. As a former military wife I would never buy anything but a Corcoran boot. The field work boot looks like it will be up to the wear and tear he puts on his footwear plus the soul is thick and has a great tread. We received them in record time to ""boot!"" THANKS! You cannot CANNOT GO WRONG with Corcoran's no matter what cut or style!"
5,I agree...,"I know this isn't the most helpful review but I would justlike to concur with the other reviews. I have had these bootsfor a year now and except for a few scuffs, they still are ingreat condition."
2,Great playing can barely be heard over the hiss & noise,"The song selections and Art's playing are truly awesome, but,the sound quality of the first ten tracks is downright pitiful!Track #11, 'Wee Baby Blues' with band & Joe Turner singing, ismore a novelty tune. The 'clean' tracks, #13 thru #19 are allfrom the double-CD release: Art Tatum 20th century piano genius- which is probably a better option. The remaining good track,#12: 'I Got Rhythm' (w/ Tiny Grimes and Slam Stewart) is fromthe CD: I Got Rhythm: Art Tatum Volume 3 (1935-1944)- listen to this disc before buying it!"
1,Tatum's Worst Hour,The pops and hiss are a horrible distraction. Sounds like a cheap tape recording of a really scratched up record. Buy any other Tatum CD and you'll be much happier.
5,A Great Contemporary Story,"I had my doubts that I would even like ""Baby Oh Baby"" due the fact that I saw it advertise in the back of another book that I didn't like, but I took a chance and bought and I am glad that I did. ""Baby Oh Baby"" is a great story about losing love and finding it again. The one thing that I really liked was the fact that the secondary characters also had a storyline to, that help to contribute to the main story. Can't wait to read more by Robin Wells"
2,Intriguing beginning and then schmaltz,"I won't go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis. After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing. Annie starts out as a strong, quirky individual by mid-book she's so hung up on Jake that she looses her charm and strength of character. Jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy. The secondary characters problems just brought the book down further. That, and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well, once again a female character ""melts"".....pun intended. I guess I had anticipated stronger female and male characters, the ones I get from ... I think Ms Wells shows promise but the next book I'll get from the library."
3,underdevelped baby,"Jake and Annie are very likeable characters in this book. I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. I also agree that it fizzled out pretty quickly. I read the whole book and enjoyed it to the end, but there were too many things that were just plain unbelievable that Ms Wells tried to weave into the plot. How many women would enter into a marriage believing that the unknown guy only has the best interests of them and the baby at heart? Annie could have really set herself up for an unhappy ending if Jake had turned out to be a self-serving man. I mean, he could have married her and then sued her for all she was worth for custody! Fortunately, the book's planned and no-surprise ending kept things on an even keel for Annie, Madeline and Jake. Maybe I'm too hardened, but this novel didn't even provide halfway believable escapism. Despite all that, Ms Wells delivers fine characterization and shows potential for future endeavors."
2,"Started out fine, but petered out...","Too much time spent on secondary characters or too much time spent apart by the main characters made this very slow reading for me. I really liked Jake to begin with but I eventually came to not really care. The initial conflict was very strong, but then the author seemed to drift off and care more on Jake's in-law's relationship. The final conflict was resolved too easily for me to really buy into it.But it's not all bad. Ms. Wells writing voice is smooth and easy. I'd be interested to see what she comes up with in the future."
5,A gem amidst a pile of rocks,"""Dreams were nothing but diving boards for disappointment. The higher you climbed, the deeper you plunged."" This sentiment could describe my reading experiences this year, until Baby, Oh Baby. In fact, it gets my early, albeit imaginary, vote for Best Contemporary for 2001. The characters were deeply realistic, yet likeble. Jake's return to the fertility clinic (""The clinic was sterile. Just like the patients who came here."") made me choke up. Annie's attention to ""signs"" and intuition was touching, not silly. Her steadfast resolve not to be second place was admirable: ""I want a no-holds-barred, not-holding-anything-back, in-it-with-everything-I've-got kind of love."" The ending scene at the courthouse was perfect, and had me singing along...""Baby, oh baby..."""
5,a real gem,"This is one of those rare romance books that just suck you in from the very beginning. There are actually two romances in one in this book. I actually found the secondary romance as good as the main one and that is not easy to find in a book. Usually you find yourself skipping over the second relationship because the first one is so much better.Actually, I think this book would adapt well as a movie. There were enough humorous parts to rival any of today's romantic comedies.If you haven't read this one, you're missing out. I'd give it 10 stars instead of the 5 allowed."
2,Bad Selection!!!!,"Why dont the people who chose songs for Mangione's compilations, instead of just keep putting the same old songs on compilation after compilation, pick some new ones. Perhaps the only reason to buy this album is for ""Floating,"" as it is the only song not yet used for a Chuck Mangione compilation."
4,Worth the Indulgence,The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is the hefty price. This briefcase is terrific and just the ticket for a baseball loving guy who traded in his glove (but not his love for the game) for a desk. It's heirloom quality and I may well come back in 20 years to give it a full five stars if it ages as well as I expect.
5,Worth every penny,Can't say very much about this.Cord doesn't tangle and there is no noticeable loss in sound quality compared to plugging phones directly in to stereo.
5,Great addition to camera,I am very happy with this product. It keep the camera completely dry and still allows full functionality of all the buttons!!
5,Great for your camera!,"I really like this housing, it's light, easy to use, easy to clean. Takes great underwater pictures from simply snorkeling to deep (30m) diving."
5,AWESOME,"I just had to write and say how wonderful this CD is. The kids and I love it so much. As a matter of fact, I listen to it when the kids aren't even with me! We have purchased it for all of our friends!"
2,Need to know some Japanese before using this product,"I found the product inadequate. This CD is a collection of children's songs, with some narrative, spoken by a child in Japanese, preceding each song. The weird thing is the narrative is completely unrelated to the song. Even my 9 year old figured out that the song following the child's narrative, was in her words ""completely random"".I don't know why the narrative wouldn't have a strong(er) relationship to the song. That aside, the songs chosen are perfect for very young children, under age 10. But there is no way you are going to ""learn"" Japanese by listening to this CD. The best result would be that you and a child would improve listening comprehension, which isn't a bad goal, but isn't how I interpreted the CD as advertised."
5,He knew he was right,A far better book than the BBC movie. i enjoyed it immensely even though it is long. Some of the characters are not real particularly some of the young women
4,Surprisingly complex,"I was happily surprised by this book. Given the snyopses, I expected the usual woman-as-victim-of-cruel-husband trope. Instead, the book presented a complex marriage, with both parties at fault; in fact, to me, the wife was in the wrong and was abusing her privileges for at least three quarters of the novel.The secondary and tertiary characters were well drawn, entertaining, and captivating. Trollope managed to convey myriad nuances of the male-female dynamic, avoiding stereotypes and common topicalities of many Victorian novels.Enjoyed this one a lot."
1,Hallmark of the disposable society?,"Just throw them away after 12 hours? I assume these are plastic. So, folks after 12 hours they are obsolete, and throw them out to create more useless landfill trash that will last 10 millenia! Yay, hooray!"
1,HORRIBLE!,I bought 5 of theese for 20.00 dollars. I turned all of them on at 10:10p.m. At exactly 10:11 p.m. they shut off and wouldn't turn back on. They had lost all of their battery and I was forced to throw them away because what is the use of a BROKEN litecube. They JUST HAVE TO make a charger for these. They were cool until they went out.
1,Too long to read!,"The section on humor is very good, but if you want to improve your presentation skills, it's no point reading a big book, you have to practice to improve.This book could have been more useful if it were more concise."
1,NO AVAILABILITY,"My rating is for Amazon, not the product. I placed this order and just received a mail that it is not available. Why is the availability not updated? I still see it being available now. Very disappointing"
5,Video Violence (Howard and Eli crapped),"Video Violence is one of the greatest horror movies ever. Howard and Eli crapped their pants in a bad way. Video Violence is just so tight. Steven has a vicious mullet, and the movie just kicks diaper butt."
3,"Not great, but good.","I bought this film because I am a huge fan of Jeremy Brett and wanted to see him in a role other than Sherlock Holmes. I would have liked this film better if Brett's character would have been a little more involved, but at least I did get to see him in a different role on screen. I also was pleased to see ""Miss Lemmon"" from ""Poirot"" in the film briefly. I don't know if I would recommend this. I bought it for a personal reason, not because I thought it would be great. For me, it filled that purpose, and I will probably watch it more than once, but not often."
4,Wonderful British films!,I've never seen a film with Judy Dench or Colin Firth in it that I didn't like very much! I would have rated this DVD five stars if it included sub-titles.
3,Poor quality digital versions,The films selected are very good but the quality of the pictures is quite poor. One feels that they are viewing a VHS tape rather than a digital dvd.
3,Almost half of them did not meet advertised ratings,"I relied upon the ratings offered on Amazon - ""Restoration,"" ""A Month By The Lake,"" ""Sweet Revence,"" did not meet my expectations. The rest of the movies made up for that. Thank goodness I didn't buy them separately.Would not loan this out unless someone really wanted to see a particular movied on it. So I wouldn't recommend the collection. My favorite was ""Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown."" ""My Life So Far"" was fairly good & had seen ""The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain."""
3,British Cinema,"Of the films viewed so far, they are quirky, well acted and do not depend on toilet humor or violence to tell a story."
4,Interesting View Into British Culture,As one would expect these producrions are beautifully presented. The quality of the acting is superb. England seems to produce character actors of great skill and presence. I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of themes presented
4,A Great Collection,A gift to myself during the Christmas season. I love Bristish film and this collection contains wonderful choices. Merry Christmas to me!
3,8 British Movies,"This was not exactly what I thought it would be.I bought this DVD because I like ""things British"", but when I looked at the movies, I realized that what I really like is ""old British"" and not the modern British things...."
3,Gift Purchase - can't rate,Gift Purchase - This is a Christmas gift and has not yet been opened by the recipient which is why I cannot rate it.
5,Excellent British Movies,This set of 8 movies are top notch entertainmentyou will enjoy some great stories with excellent actingso do your self a favor and order this set of movieschfancierFancier of fine movies
3,"Great theatre, no captions","Live in a household with hearing impared person, and need the close captioning for her enjoyment. this film doesn't have it. But I love anything with Colin Firth,, so will keep"
1,The picture quality was AWFUL!!!,"Being a collector of period pieces, I have never watched a collection with such aweful picture quality. Do not buy this collection if you want mediocre or good quality viewing."
3,All streamed on Netflix,"If you have Netflix, all eight movies available. Just loaded streaming queue.Netflix is strange, it's only when I search for specific titles I find anything good."
2,British Film Collection,We've watched three of the eight and find them hard going. I thought they would be historical but have found the plots to be mundane and predictable. Maybe the others will be better.
3,good,Was alot of value for my money and i hope to see multiple movies on dvd more often for our value
2,so-so,These movies were overall not that good for me. i had 2 of them already and didn't enjoy the others
3,Disappointed with the choices on these DVD's,"I am a fan of Colin Firth and Hugh Grant and Judi Dench, but the choices on these two disks are only so so. There are only two of the eight movies included which I consider worth watching. Really disappointed."
5,Excellent Collection,I am a great fan of Colin Firth and bought it for that reason. A fortunate purchase because there are some great films that I may have missed.
3,3 good out of 8,"My life so far, The englishmen who, Mrs Brown, are very good. Restoration, and sweet revenge were so boring that I never saw the end. Tom and Viv, that i finished for the sake of TS Eliott, is very average as are a month by the lake, and an ideal husband."
5,Movie,"It was brand new as stated and received very quickly. I love BBC and historical pieces. This is a good one, especially for this price."
3,Just Okay,"There's nothing wrong with this necklace, but there's nothing that great about it either. The sapphire was a much darker blue than pictured and the whole piece was smaller than advertised. While I don't really have much to complain about, I just wasn't overly impressed."
3,"good card, bad support","Warning! There is no toll-free support number. Warning! If you buy this card, plan on spending ...additional [money] in long distance charges (that's what my bill came to) or maybe more, to fix any installation problems. And, problems seem inevitable with their self-contradicting installation directions."
3,NOTICE,"Someone mentioned maybe trying an ATI Radeon 7500. If you get the All In Wonder Version many of them DO NOT come with a cooling fan on the card!!! Believe me, with this much power you NEED a cooling fan. Always check the ATI site and click on their 'large' picture image and make sure you get a cooling fan with EVERY card, built in. I have a 7500 without AIW and it works 100% great and runs cool with the factory fan on the card."
1,Big let down from ATI - All in Wonder Radeon 8500DV,"Been in the computer industry for many years. Trusted ATI in the past, but this card is the worst thing I have ever had to try and install. I spent over 12 hours trying to install this card and make it work. Currently I have been able to get my system back to where it was prior to attempting this installation. If I could only get it to keep from locking up I would be there. To the writers of the latest code for this card, you shoud be hung from the highest tree. I had had high hopes for the functionality of this card, but with this recent adventure, I will never buy anything from ATI again. In summary, I think a perfect acronym for this card is POS, use your imagination!"
1,DON'T GET THIS!,"OK, amazon.com is completely wrong. It says this card is worth [$$$] give or take five cents. The new one, supposedly comming out in August or September, is much better, and is going to be at a retail price of [$$$]. Itis MUCH better, and definately worth the wait. HOWEVER, if you must buy a new graphics card now, you should get the NVIDIA ti 4600 by VISION TREK. Not, by PNY, their customer service is very bad, even though they give a very good warranty. (Even read other reviews about PNY consumers). The NVidia 4600 is much better than the ATI 8500, however again, when the ATI 9700 comes out, that will take the crown. Until than, the NVidia 4600 is proudly wearing it."
1,Be aware of ATI products,"I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great. I have quite extensive experience with PCs (I have put together over 100 of them) and it took me 6 hours to make this card work. I would give it more stars but..... First of all, when I bought it, it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included. Well it wasn't, instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I wasn't able make it work. Secondly, when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers. I would call them but they charge you over [X] a minute for support. So the bottom line don't count on any support from ATI."
3,Verify Your Motherboard Supports the Firewire Port,"Great board except the firewire feature does not work on many motherboards. ATI's response to that is to tell you to get new BIOS from your motherboard manufacturer. Only way to get it to work in non-compatible motherboards is to turn off the firewire port. This basically shuts off the ""DV"" part of the product.Confirm it works with your motherboard and BIOS before buying."
3,Good? Bad? Bugs?,"I have seen many reviews on this card, i have found that the 8500DV card and drivers are very unstable. when the tv is playing it will freeze the picture or go dark and the sound keeps playing, must reboot as it freezed whole computer except sound continues to play. problem with IE and using the transparecy feature - or even rezizing the tv/video frame causes instability. I am using winxp pro w/ srv pk 1 and all updates installed - it is an ok card if you only use it for video display only. Also, card freezes system while playing tiger woods 2003 - sound continues to play but system is locked up. must reboot - i haven't tried other games yet as i am fearful of locking up. why doesn't ATI offer trade in trade up cards for problem issues??? that is an excellent way to keep their customer base satisfied and bugs to a min.Overall, the card gets a 3 of 5 but a 1 of 5 when it comes to price vs. performance.Good luck."
2,This Card is fair - service is really bad,Used the card for about 4 weeks and had problems with audio which traced to the bad (...) connector on back..efforts to get service have failed ...This card and its associated software should have been more extensively tested by ATI.
1,Bad product. Horrible drivers,"I purchased this product to upgrade my old all-in-wonder card. I love ATI for their wonderfully multi-functional cards but they really need to do a better job of writing software for them. I tried to install this card on Windows 2000 with all the latest drivers and with the exact instructions (after reading another review here) for each driver. The end result was video with vertical lines on both the DVD player and the TV software. Spent 4 more days trying to fix the problem but just gave up in the end and went back to my old ATI card. I might try the Radeon 7500 in the near future (since I suspect that the ""DV"" output of the card had something to do with my problems)."
3,Clarks shoes,I wasn't as pleased with these shoes as I have been with other Clark's products. The shoes seem wider than medium and don't have much arch support.The service I received from Amazon was excellent.
5,A Fabulous Surprise,"I never thought I would get addicted to this book in the way that I did. As a hetero female, I assumed I wasn't the target audience. And I'm not. But that's besides the point. The stories are so engaging, so honest and funny that they transcend gay porn or erotic fiction. They're fascinating stories--a truly spectacular entree into the world of the penis."
2,Author Succeeds in Making Erotica Boring.,"I'm sure the 'Did you find this review helpful?' patrol will vote me off the island, but this is absolutely the WORST collection of erotica I've ever read... and I've read (er um) lots.Look elsewhere... this one's a snooze."
2,Not very innovative,"I'm no sure of the original release date, but it sure sounds like 1980's style avantgarde stuff. Most of the sounds and ""melodies"" are virtualy cliche by today's standards. If you like Eno's ""music for airports"" this album will probably bore you and you'd be better off with other Hassel albums or Harold Bud."
4,GOOD DEATH/BLACK METAL,"At last I found this release on Japanese import. This band originally signed up to the label WRONG AGAIN RECORDS for this release- although unfortunately they went bankrupt and getting hold of this cd has proved a nightmare worlwide due to very little printing!If you dont know NAGLFAR, they play blackened death metal in the typical Swedish variety(ie, like Dissection). This group are a little different though, so they are not completely unoriginal. Most of the music is mid-paced, although fairly brutal with good growling vocals. The group have also added a couple of classical twists in their sound, and this is more thrashy sometimes than the usual stuff I hear!Overall this has very good material, although this can get a bit boring to listen to sometimes. I recommend that if you like the Swedish death/black scene, then buy this release, and the groups latest called DIABOLICAL- which I think is better!cheers!"
5,Great performances!!,"A very interesting compilation of wonderful performances, from several heavy duties of the prog rock scene in the 90s. The progfest was an amazing opportunity of enjoy our well beloved bands, old and new! The John Wetton Band is at its best in this concert, and also are specially inspired the intervention of Spock's Beard and Arena. The Flower Kings is always a great presence, and watching Le Orme after so many years, was a wonderful surprise.Thanks to the progfest! To have the video is at least a good consolation for all of us who were not able to be there. Only problem is that you want to watch more of the performances!!"
4,cool back pack,"I was skeptical about my purchase of Columbia Umatilla Cyberpack,but as soon as the product reached and I opened the box all my doubts were cleared. It is really a ""cool back pack"" as it has lots of space for all the things which a college/anybody who is always on the move likes to carry.Only disadvantage is that it cannot stand on it's own when you put it on the floor. On the whole I am happy with the product and using it to the fullest.Will recommend this product to anyone who wants to have a back pack for less price and with all those pockets."
2,backpack,Great looking bag. The compartments are the best I have had in a back pack. The support structure is poorly designed which leads to pressure spots on the shoulders and early failure of the seams. Baby it a little (avoid using just one strap with more than a lite load) and it should do ok for the price.
4,Big band Cajun,"An interesting CD which gets better each time I listen..Being used to the basic home grown Cajun style of four or five people standing around an echoey room, the 'Big (ish) band' style of the CD came as a bit of a shock - initially somewhat disapointing.. But now, I love it!"
3,Not A Real Comedy,"Back in 1958 I was just a 9 year old boy. Never got the chance to watch Onionhead in the Movies. Since I loved No Time for Sergeants, I thought Onionhead would be kinda on the same level. The movie did have some funny moments but, all in all it wasn't a real comedy. I actually purchased Onionhead on VHS Video tape to convert it to DVD. While I watched it I was disappointed about it not being as funny as I was hoping it would be. It may not be as funny as I was hoping for but, the Movie does a moral question for the main character about the right thing to do. Of course he does the right thing in the end! To sum it up I liked it but, didn't love it!"
3,The USB Cord is WAY Too Short!!,"This product arrived with an absurdly short USB cord, which was extremely frustrating! Of my 5 USB devices, this card reader has, by far, the shortest cord. As for many computer users, my computer sits beneath my desk & this VERY short cord JUST BARELY allows the card reader to reach the corner of my desktop. There are 3 reasons why I can imagine SimpleTech might offer a cord of this inadequate length:1. They don't mind aggravating their customers, And/Or2. They viewed it as an easy way to make another 25 cents profit, And/Or3. It was simple negligence which reflects poorly on their concern for quality.On the other hand, the unit does seem to work okay. Also, on two previous occasions I've purchased Flash Cards from SimpleTech and both have served me well."
2,A poor implementation of Plug N' Play,"This device should configure a lot easier than it does. I'm a programmer with many years of experience configuring hardware. I found this one annoying to set up.You may have to download new drivers for this device from the simpletech website. Once you get the correct version of the drivers, and install it following the instructions EXACTLY (the device cannot be plugged in while loading the software) it eventually works ok.Note that there are two DIFFERENT part numbers for this device. 90000-40388-001 and 90000-40388-002. The 001 version does not support some platforms that the 002 version does. I recieved the 001 and have had no end of difficulty with it.If I had it to do over again, I would spend a bit more, and get a device from another company that supported more than two media types."
3,work great (with new drivers),"This is not plug-n-play. It works great IF you have the right drivers. It took me a couple days of hard work and lots of downloads and fiddling to get it to work. Once I did, it worked great."
2,Works sometimes,"From what I understand of these types of hardware, they are created in batch by varying hardware component manufacturers and the resold to vendors (e.g. Simpletech) who combine them into the nice products we buy for distribution.Unfortunately SimpleTech doesn't quite get things right. The driver installation for this product went smoothly on Windows XP. It was a matter of clicking the mouse a few times, a reboot, and plugging in the device into a USB slot.However, what followed afterwards and for succeeding attempts at getting the thing to be recognized by your PC would be what I call my own form of digital gambling. Some days the device works when I plug it in, and some days it doesn't. The odds are usually not in my favor.I would have much preferred a more expensive item that worked all the time."
3,Check the model rev. if you use OS X,"Just some advice if you're an OS X user thinking of purchasing this product: (FlashLink UCS-200 is discontinued) which is not compatible with OS X. The currently shipping UCS-200 model *is* compatible with OS X; be sure to check which model you're ordering. I gave it a 3-star rating even though I can't use it (unless I reboot into OS 9, which is too much of a pain to bother with), only because I'm required to give a rating to post a review."
1,Not worth it,"This card reader isn't any faster or more convenient than downloading directly with my digital camera, and was a lot less reliable. We bought a pcmcia reader and are much more satisfied with it."
1,This game SUCKS!,"I bought this game and it really sucks! The reason that I bought this game was because I like Rocket Power a lot, and I thought it would be cool to have this game. Once I played it I got bored and wanted to sell it. It doesnt save at all. You have to write passwords down!If you are planning to have this game, you shouldnt! Dont waste money for the worst game I've ever played."
2,Trite story line with poor recipes,"I was new to Guanajuato and enjoyed the parts of the book the discuss the city. But the story line was trite, even contrived. THe ""culinary"" part of the mystery included recipes that, while tasty, are hardly gourmet -- they mostly consisted of things made with Campbell's soup. Not one that I recall was indigenous to Mexico. At least it was a quick read."
4,Pretty Good,"In this book, Pam finds herself having trouble with Lightning that she doesn't know why. Soon, Lightning starts getting more dangerous and gives Pam a couple more bruises. That's when it's decided to get Pam's dad involved, but what's wrong with Pam's Pony? I liked that at the beginning for once that I didn't have a clue what the problem was. Even though I am getting a little old for this series, I like the fact that these books are well written and deserved to be read."
5,"If you know what Atari is, buy this!","I've been searching for a gamecube game that is like the old style Atari-Like video games I grew up with and here it is! Plus, when you succeed with a pac-man game (not sure how many levels), you are given a bonus game of Pac Man to try which was a wonderful surprise. The galaxia games are pretty much like I remember. Pole Position is still hard for me to maneuver. Also no directions onscreen so plan on figuring out the game for yourself. I love it because it's simple w/ no frills!"
5,Love the classics,"This game is simply amazing and flawless! There are some unlockables, and all the games have multi-player action! It's seriouly like a classic arcade, rooled into a updated game system. Before I go on with the posative, I have one just one, the entire reveiw, I promis this is the only negative...In some of the pac-man games, if you play on a small TV (like me) then it's hard to see everything in general.*gasping for air* I'm so glad that negative part is over! Back to the posative!With three totally new games: Pac-man Arrangement, Galaga Arrangement, and Dig-Dug arrangement. These are all great games, that are so much fun!In addition, there are two games you can unlock:1. Pac-attack - Unlock by scoring 20,000 points or more in Pac-man2. Pac-Mania - Unlock by scoring 15,000 points or more in Ms. Pac-ManPros -EverythingCons -Read above"
5,Great sale!,"Great item, and I'm enjoying it, thanks! Great sale too! Item came to me very quickly! I'm very happy with my order!"
3,Classic,Galaga and Pac-Man are classics. DigDoug and Pole Position are only slightly more exciting than Tic-Tac-Toe. If you can find it for under $10 it will be worth it.
1,12 games for 9 bucks,"Yep thats right 12 games for 9 Bucks. No kidding. Yeah. But the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is the fact that yeah you get all of those games but you get 2 repeats (galaga, gal Im not saying i dont like the game (considering that i bought it solely for the galaga & ms pac man) but it should be more of a selection than just having all the galaga's Some might disagree with me but oh well. The fact that it has all these old original arcade titles loves it. It would be better with a regular tv rather than a wide screen, as all the games are narrow. Funplay its like being in the arcade all over again, difficulity- that digout game is the only one that i am having trouble with! and graphics (who cares) Your playing your favorite titles which is why you bought it so dont cry for mommy if its not in HD!For the money you cant go wrong"
1,This reference book is terrible!,"I wish I had bought the Roget's International version. There are so few synonyms in this thesaurus--and if I want definitions, I'll use the dictionary. Synonyms: worthless, useless, stink-o"
1,"I don't know about this edition, but 1st was crap. Try...","Buy ""The Synonym Finder"" if you want a REALLY good thesaurus. I am only familiar with the first edition of ""Roget's II,"" but I consider that edition to be among the worst volumes in print."
1,an unusual writing technique,"Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus, ""Ulysses,"" did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in 1922.Thus it was that the artist, while composing his next work, ""Finnegan's Wake,"" got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys, a poignant expression, obviously, of the searing torment boiling within him.Happily for us, the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume."
4,It helps if you drink,"Imagine you're in a pub in Dublin, and a regular has started talking to you. The combined amount of beer in both of you makes it difficult to understand much of what he's saying, but every once in a while there's a moment of clarity where you get it. You laugh not only at what's said but at yourself for the situation you're in. In the meantime you can only stare gape-mouthed at the beauty of the sounds he makes and in hopes that another moment of clarity is near.It is easy to get frustrated with this book if you can't get comfortable with its style."
2,Do you have no family or job?,"There may be rewards here for people who are intelligent enough and have the time to spend, but that's not me. I've always felt ""smart."" (800, 800 and 730 on the GRE's-degrees in mathematics) but this book made me feel like a mental midget. Either Joyce had an I.Q. of about 775 or there is nothing here to understand. I don't have time to find out. At least we got the word, ""quark,"" from this book."
2,Finnegans Wake Me Up,"One wonders how many of the positive (4 or 5 stars) reviewers here are either (1) intellectual poseurs who say they've read the book cover to cover but actually haven't read more than a little; or (2) if they have read it in its entirety, whether they have too much spare time on their hands.One thing it is not (contrary to what some pretentious reviewers here would have you believe) is a ""fun read"" or ""page turner"".Despite some glittering word play and demonstrations of great scholarship, Finnegan's wake is a hulking mess."
1,Gibberish!,"""Out door, keel cooling vorsnevou."" You could add this sentence to this mass of drivel and no one would know it wasn't written by Joyce. If the point of this book is the utter incomprehensibility of mankind, Joyce greatly contributes to it with this rambling waste of paper. A monkey and a typewriter could have written this ""experimental"" trash. I cannot see any way in which this ""work"" is a classic. It is stream of conscience gibberish. Anyone could have done it."
1,Ridiculously Bad,"I am a fan of Joyce's writing especially Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, but this is pure garbage. Thank goodness for the look inside features at amazon, so that people will be able to know what to expect when ordering Finnegans Wake. The novel has no plot and lacks the vivid descriptions of seemingly meaningless things that made Joyce's other novels so great. Here, he picks random foreign words and places them wherever he please just to make his book seem original and artistic. The result is an incomprehensible piece of garbage that is not only plotless but devoid of any writing ability and talent.Use the look inside features to see what I'm talking about."
1,An Udder Disaster,"The cow who dried up was an udder disaster....like this gibberish novel. Even JJ's best friends and critics called it drivel (his brother included). I guess after writing Ulysses, JJ felt somehow had to create something more mystic. Well, he certainly succeeded. I have a standing $1,000 bet with anyone and the challenge is that I will open 3 random pages of FW and have the reader explain, in detail, who the parties are, what the sentences are about and mean. I am quite confident than there is no one out there who can do that. Period. So much for a memorable reading experience."
1,Huh?,"Will someone please, please tell me what the heck this man is talking about? This is the book for people who didn't find The Jaberwocky to have quite the necessary amount of pretentious pseudo-english garbage. Don't even bother trying to read this."
5,Don't write a review until you read this and waited...,"Don't write a review until you read this and waited.Finnegans Wake takes time to penetrate the mind.At first, it makes no sense. But keep trying, and try, and try...and then you will get its awesomeness."
5,Cross-world,"O.k. this book is unreadable. It is not enjoying and it definitely shows you your limits in all categories. But what power must lie within a text whose first 5 or 6 lines could be the subject of 100 dissertations or 1000s of interpretations that make sense too. Just hand the first paragraph to a student class and let them brainstorm what could be meant by ""riverrun,... commodius vicus or recirculation, ...etc."" and you will see and feel it."
1,NOOOOOO,NO! BOOK BAD BOOK BAD BIG BIG WORDS I DONT UNDERSTAND! MY BRAIN HURTSSSS! THIS MAKE NO SENCE. YAHOO CHAT MUCH EAZYIER TO UNDeRSTAND! I GO THERE NOW.
3,not as good as Dubliners,I liked it when Finnegan woke up. There was also the part when James Joyce wrote the second chapter - that was good too. Not as good as Dubliners though.
1,word salad as verbal Rorschach test,"let the high preists of deconstructionist post modernism interpret it for you. bow down before the wisdom of frustrated ineffectual professors of English, the preistly class who will interpret this message from the gods for you, (and actually get pay and respect for it). lets get real. this is a book by a sciziphrenic for the pompous and pedantic. a few puns aside dont waste your life trying to interpret this nonsense, just because you have an ego. (even Nobel laureates fell for it--hence the quark, but FASHIONABLE NONSENSE is the delayed reaction)the real dope: read: WHAT ART IS. MADNESS AND MODERNITY. and THE FOUNTAINHEAD. for some insight into why nonsense like this continues to propagate."
1,this is bad,"This book is bad, and I think it was intended to be so. Probably upset with the over analysis of Ulysses, Joyce must have set out to play a trick on the literary world. This book has no value except to make you laugh at how far some people would go to pretend that it could be interpreted. There are better wastes of ones time, for example staring at a blank wall."
1,One of the most unreadable books ever!,"Which should be the only reason one would have this book in a collection.Daferring on red hair moots the ramdelgerag! Cays hast ner eyed the entire lash from the libre, does get sidlelassinlunahack? And for ery' scholar of jits and wallyfins, dare may cieved a consciousable readament of peering quenth Labrynth. Hark! Vain! Rack! Finnegans Wake dost injoyafun for the kathweolasopkookoo. One glance may planner read and ner open this Rhodical magnumus.If you understood what I just wrote then you may just enjoy this book."
1,WTF is this?!,"Real words, unlike what you'd find in this book, cannot describe what you find in here. This book is the bane of my existence. James Joyce must have self-inflicted mercury poisoning in order to write this. The only other plausible explanation is that he became severely mentally retarded from a lack of flow of oxygen to the brain. If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY ""sentence"". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of. If the author came back to life, became unretarded, and then read his own book again, he would instantly want to drown himself in Lake Michigan. I award him no stars and may God have mercy on his soul."
2,Evelyn Waugh,"Evelyn Waugh once described this book as 'gibberish' and added that you could see James Joyce going madder by the page. That said, it's quite amusing to read bits from."
1,Naked Emperors,"Admirers of this glimpse into madness must have a great need to feel smug and superior. Such ""intellectuals"" are painfully desperate and afraid of reality; for it is only in the realm of the naked emperors that they can pretend to be hip."
4,This Book Reminds Me of The Arghherd and Then I Was Crying,"book cause when you're reading it you're on the other part; they're calling it the levels. I was running earlier when this book came along. Some people in the other room were sleeping until I fell of my chair. That is. It was arguably the best moment because of smiles and of course the ""Temper-Chur"". Zabadoo-zing song rides twice in the loop. Finnegans Wake is a spectacular"
2,"Understanding ""Switters""","In Tom Robbins ""Fierce Invalids Home From Warm CLimates"" the main character Switters is attempting to read this book and never gets though the first 5 pages. I now understand why."
5,this book is cool,this book is like so cool man i mean it is like watching the spice girls movie cept its in a book i really like it so i think you should buy it
2,The Story of Humanity?,"The point being, presumedly, that humanity is incomprehensible to humanity? How is my understanding of, or sympathy toward, humanity improved by attempting to read and decode the word ""Bababadalgharaghtakamminnarronkonnbronntonneronntuon- thunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoordenenthurnuk""? There are many far greater works that not only tell the same story, but are readable and even enjoyable. My apologies to those who like Finnegan's Wake, but humanity is not best served by having its story told in gibberish."
2,Less than impressed. Weak compared to his other works.,"While Joyce's Ulysses demonstrates his monstrous success with literary experimentation styles, FW does not. I find it poor by his standards. In academics (and among pseudo-intellectuals) the book is quite fashionable, and understably so - the style is unique. Its almost comical to listen to my fellow Joyce fans rave about it. But whenever I corner them, and beg them to dissect the work for me, the responses are as incoherent as the book itself. Perhaps it inspires creative thinking/translation from its readers, but nothing of the sort on my part, despite my repeated efforts to sincerely read it.I've read far worse, that's for sure, but someone thinking of dabbling with Joyce for the first time should seriously consider selecting one of his more substantial earlier works, or the frustration with FW may alienate them forever from an otherwise brilliant and often very powerful author."
2,Houston...we have a problem,"I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world."
2,Fails As Literature,"Fascinating as a look into the symbol-laden mind of the highly learned James Joyce. The entire history of the world up until the first quarter of the twentieth century is here. Unfortunately, you have to spend years playing archaeologist to discover its hidden treasures. I've spent two years studying this thing, and will waste no more of my life on it: everything that Joyce has said in this has been said more eloquently and (obviously) more clearly elsewhere.NOTE: If you're undecided about this, read the first page. If you hate it, you'll hate the rest. If you love it, you'll love the rest. The quality of the writing stays fairly consistent."
1,Finnegans Wake,"Well, what can I say? This kind of writing would never make it past Mrs. Johnson, my 7th grade English and Grammar school teacher. I made many attempts at reading this gibberish. To those who like this book, kudos's to you few. I highly recommend this book as an anchor on night stands of insomniacs everywhere. I join the ranks of those who do not like this book. I'm sure there is something enriching in there, somewhere. Who was the editor? I know it was not Mrs. Johnson!Jimmy Lair"
2,He's challenging us to doodle...,"I give this book two stars because it's the first, and last, book to tell us what we already should know...that we think gibberish in that ethereal state between waking and sleep. Finningan's Wake reminds me of the canvas I've seen at countless art shows with a jumble of random splatterings of paint. Any one of us could create the same thing. Why don't we? Joyce is challenging us to get off our duffs and splatter some paint on the canvass. If you think it's worthwhile (personally, I don't) do it. You could be the next James Joyce."
1,I do not like Finnegans Wake,"I think it's rather dumb to write a book for the purpose of making it difficult to read. If you want to be allusive, that's fine, but express yourself coherantly and in an unambiguous fashion. Ulysses and A Portrait managed to be both timelessly powerful and legible; it's a pity Joyce didn't make better use of his seventeen years."
5,Nursing as a Ministry,"Again, Sr Mary Elizabeth O'Brien has writeen an excellent book. I give this book to nurses when they graduate. It truly puts nurses in an angelic and spiritual perspective which they deserve."
5,Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life,"I purchased this book as ""used"". It is in excellent shape. At the moment I am still reading it. Great."
3,Dry but full of truth.,"It's pretty hard to get through some of this book. I had to read it for a program that I'm doing through my church. There's a lot of good information, especially in the fasting chapter; but overall it tends to be a little repetitive and there aren't enough practical suggestions for how to actually start doing the things he suggests we should do, at least not for my liking. Overall, it was a fair book - you probably won't enjoy it much but you'll benefit from what it says, if you put it into practice."
4,Solid.,"This book is a solid read and works well as a go-to-guide to spiritual disicplines. The section on journaling is dated, but perhaps you could draw a correltation to bloggin. Either way, it is worth a read."
5,Best Spiritual Disciplines Book,"There is a lifetime worth of practical advice on developing spiritual disciplines. Chapter on Bible Intake 1 & 2, Prayer, Worship, Evangelism, Serving, Stewardship, Fasting, Silence & Solitude, Journaling, Learning and Perseverance in the disciplines."
5,Fantastic!,"Any Christian, new or old, needs to read this book! It will absolutely change the way you go about life!"
2,Disappointing . . .,"I had read 5 or more rave reviews about this book and was excited to receive it. After reading it, I am sorry to say that it was not life changing, inspiring or even a good read. The book seems so childish to me. Maybe because I am 50 and the author is 29. Maybe the lessons she is trying to pass on I have learned a long time ago. Things like it's not O.K. to tease or take advantage of another person. . . Just disappointing. Maybe it is a good read for someone who hasn't done a great deal of living yet."
4,Single in Saudi,It is interesting but these nurses are very naughty. Gives nurses a bad reputation. No wonder the countries in these regions look up us as immoral.
2,Misleading,"If you are interested in learning about Saudi Arabia, this is not the book for you. It is a collection of the writer's true or imagined sexual experiences. Having lived in many countries I believe there is so much to see, learn, teach, get involved in, etc.,that focusing on sex is a waste of the experience. Writing style and vocabulary is also very simple, almost childlike. I'm almost finished with the book, and so far there is only one chapter that I found interesting."
1,Copyright BEFORE reading...,"Single in Saudi is a complete work of FICTION! It says so in the copyright. I have made that mistake before so now I always check to see if it is fictional or is a true event or sadly ...true EVENTS! If you like autobiographical books or biographical as I do, always look for the copyright. Also, get the sample first. If you do not like fiction then you need not pay for it!!"
4,Good quality,This faucet had a very nice manifold. It was extremely compact and very heavy. The finish on the hardware was good quality.
1,Dual Moniter support doesn't work with 2 CRT's,"I bought this card to because it is a reasonably priced dual moniter card. I have two CRT's (21"" and 19"") and wanted to increase my desktop real estate. It does not work well for this purpose. Installation was easy in my Dell 8100 system, but there is only one vga plug on the card, the other is DVI. Great if you have a LCD, but otherwise you must use an expensive adapter... Anyway, the output from the DVI port is of very poor quality. This may be because of the adapter, but regardless. it does not have a useful second output. Too bad, now I'm trying to use two separate card, which will be much harder to configure."
3,So-So,"This card is is the the ATI equivelant to the Nvidia's Geforce 4 MX video cards. Only it doesn't perform as good. It is 2,000 lower on 3dmark than the MX series. If you are to get it, then get it for $99 or under."
4,?,"I'm not really sure what to rate this card for I am having trouble installing the drivers. From what I hear it is a great ""budget"" card and is worth the price. Installation was easy to a point... Getting the card in was a snap but for some reason I had a great deal of trouble getting the drivers installed. After I finished installing them my computer would freeze, sometimes I'd even get a confusing error sign. So my suggestion is, if you've never seen the inside of a computer and have some cazy idea that its going to blow up if you touch it, then get a professional to do it..."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CARD IF YOU ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE,"I bought this card, and within minutes of purchasing the card on Amazon.com I tried to cancell it, I purchased the wrong card. I tried all the right way of trying to cancell it, but it looks like Amazon can get a card ready for shipping within minutes of a purchase, but the delivery date is August 15. I have written you an email, now how long will it take to get a response with Amazon."
2,"Doesn't block the heat much, flimsy mouse pad","Unlike other reviews here, for me the lapinator and mousepad didn't work so well. Used it with a Toshiba Satellite laptop and optical mouse. After about 2 hours, the lapinator was almost HOT to the touch, laptop fan did not run less, laptop itself did not feel cool to the touch. Had better luck with other coolant systems. Maybe Toshibas run hotter than other laptops, so it could be a matter of that particular laptop not being well-suited for the lapinator. I run my new HP Pavillion right on my desk's surface, with no resulting overwarming of the laptop or the desk surface. Possibly, this particular cooling pad works optimally with only certain laptops."
5,Your lap will never be the same,"The comfort, the ease of use, and finally, a protective surface for my tender lap that was being burned off by the heat of laptop! Lapinator to the rescue!I'll be honest, this isn't my first lapinator. I have bought two before and used them for meetings. When I got a new house, I had to have one for here too, so I got the ultimate! With a mouse holder! Way cool and good for either righties or lefties! :)I've tried them all, every product to protect my privates, and this is the only one I'll trust my tender thighs to!"
4,It Works Great!,"It really works! This is my second one. I have the smaller one at my boyfriend's place. My laptop gets hot since it is a 12"" with a touchscreen. And I can really tell the difference. I give it 4 stars because it isn't the most comfortable for a lap but it isn't uncomfortable. I would really give it 4.5. And the mouse piece is great. Don't need it with the plus and small laptops but definitely need it for the smaller lapinator. JustMake sure you put the border on or the mouse slides off. The border foam is included. I bought two so I do love this product. It may have a silly name but it definitely works!"
2,Laminator Plus,"I was really disappointed to find this pad is two seperate pieces; I assumed the mouse pad slid out, but it doesn't. It is wedged in the bottom; very inconvenient. I would not recommend it. The pad itself is fine, it does have a small loop of velcro on the rear to hold your AC cord, it catches on your clothes and I will probably cut it off."
1,Dont buy this!,I like alot of music but this I dont.I dont even think this should be called music.Every song sound the same.This cd is plain horribal.Dont buy it unless your on the highschool football team so you can fit in with the other jocks.
5,Hatebreed,"I read a reveiw on here from a customer named xtestosteronexsupplimentsx and he seemed to think that Hatebreed stole their sound from such non-hardcore bands as Slipknot and others. Well, seeing that Hatebreed was formed in the early 90's I don't see how that could be. Sorry man, but you just don't know. Hatebreed is a brutal hardcore band with in-your-face hard hitting riffs and relentless vocals. I love the music of Hatebreed. Being a Christian I do find some of their lyrics confrontational but the music is great. It can get a bit repetative but nonetheless good. This band is for those who enjoy true hardcore, not what has recently been attributed as hardcore (for example bands like Korn, Slipknot, Kid Rock....these are pop bands that are very heavy...not hardcore bands. hardcore is different). If you have any comments just write me an e-mail."
5,The best,I bought this cd when it first came out. It has not left my cd player yet. The only problem is that it's kinda short. But I can deal with that because it's heavy. The bigger problem is that I haven't heard of them touring. I hope they do!
3,i ve known hatebreed since they started,Many people have not heard HATEBREEDS older recordings.There new record kind of lacks some of the anger and ferocity of older recordings.It was a little disappointing to hear their first big release.If you like their albim on victory then you must hear their old stuff. Not a bad cd but does not compare to older recordings like the hatebreed/integrity split 7in.
5,outstanding...,"Im ussualy into something much more brutal & insane & gore then the likes of hatebreed but i can't deny tha fact that i enjoy their music alot! I seen this guys at ozzfest & i did enjoy their performance alot & i just like how their music attracts all kinds of people...Some how that makes me like them even more! I quess that's hatebreed for you! Okay, hatebreed's new album ""rise of brutaly"" as well as the one before that ""perseverance"" are also pretty amazing in itslef...Support hatebreed!PS: I hate the fact that they put slipknot in the same category as hatebreed...F*ck slipknot--they suckkk!!!!!!! Only posers listing to slipknot,f*ck 'em!"
1,Hatebreed is kind of awful,"Hatebreed's just another pesky ""hardcore"" band destroying the scene. A bunch of...guys yelling about beliefs that aren't even their own? Sounds kind of like Slipknot. That's not the hardcore mentality, ...Hatebreed is the assumed forerunner of Victory Records, keeping good bands like Grade, Shelter, and Snapcase from playing main stage. Instead, they have to open up for a cross between nu-metal and rock and roll."
5,Brutal!!!!,"Wow!!! Just insane and just how I like it. NO rapping. No singing. No slow parts!!!!! It is short but it still well worth it!!! Closest thing to what they sound like is probably Soulfly. EVERY SINGLE TRACK IS GOOD!!! I cant even say that about Slipknot! Although, Slipknot is the best band out there. Another band to check out is Mudvayne!!"
4,For the General Audience,"This doesn't mean its bad, its simply mainstream. I mean, they dont bother tagging those on unless it is a widely known band. Hatebreed are not fanpleasers, great live, and have strangely undertstandable vox on this album. They've got the emotion many bands with the same formula lack, and thats what set them apart from others. They've got the feeling of hxc and the temps of mxc. It's not so much a blend of the two, but their own interpretation of both. This is beyond mediocre, but its not going to blow you away. They have more talent but this is the sound they like and their slight maturing of their sound is what keeps them going strong. This is what people see as a defining album, but its nothing of the sort, it simply excels at what its set out for. Breakdowns designed for the mosh it seems, if you get into it."
5,Why does nobody seem to care about this album?!,"People call themselves a huge Hatebreed fan, but they don't have this, let alone the fact that they have probably never heard any of the 25 minutes of brutality that is Hatebreed's indie-debut. I won't say their new stuff sucks (it rocks), but this is even better. Go down to a Newbury comics or somewhere where you can find some great underground metal and check it out, especially if you like Perseverance or Rise Of Brutality."
5,The best of the best,"This CD works wonders on people. If I had to fight Mike Tyson, I would make sure to have this CD with me before the fight. This CD is sick. My dog likes it, too."
3,too narrow for me..,"Nice shoe but apparantly this brand runs narrow because another pair of their shoes ran narrow, too."
1,A Disservice to Martial,"This is a very poor translation. Martial is a lively, urbane poet with a razor-sharp wit; his language is precise and powerful. James Michie's translation is insipid as poetry, and often unrecognizable when set next to the Latin. A single example: Mr. Michie has a penchant for translating simple Latin words like ""terra"" into configurations like ""turf and dew,"" rather than the obvious and elegantly simple ""earth."" In Michie's translation, Martial's more beautiful elegiac lyrics are made gaudy and his urban bullets of observation become flaccid. Get the Loeb Martial and a good dictionary and work through the epigrams yourself. You will be better served by Loeb's literal translation than something that sounds as if it were written by a mediocre pre-Raphaelite poet."
4,Interesting obscure book.,"All I know of this book is that it has a lot of family history, and it is very hard to find. I've heard that it is available in limited viewing at Saint John The Baptist Catholic church in Johnsburg Illinois but couldn't find it. In any case if you can find it I'm sure it will cost an arm and a leg."
5,Score true to movie,"Many piano-vocal reductions for musicals are completely different from the original score. This one stays surprisingly true, though the left hand is missing a lot of interesting rhythms, and not many vocal harmonies are present. The keys of all songs are the same as the movie, and all intros, choruses, and verses are intact. Some of the interludes and dances are shortened or omitted, however. If you're looking for the karaoke CD, try iTunes."
3,"Good, But:","This is an easy to read surgery text with up to date techniques and tests; however, there are numerous errors in the text. For the most part they are simple ones, easily reasoned out (i.e. gastric pH decreased with PPIs); but, for a seventh edition this kind of sloppiness calls into question the integrity of rest of the text."
5,Another Winner by Jackpine Bob,"""Born to Pull"" is vintage Bob Cary, maybe his best work ever. As always the question is, is it Cary's marvelous prose or his illustrations that make this book great? Wait. It's illustrated by someone else - Gail de Marcken. But Bob, please don't try to tell us you had no hand in the art work.Even if the reader is a die-hard dog sled fan there are things to be learned in this book. Even die-hard Cary fans will be moved by the stories of mushers and their dogs.This is a beautifully put-together book. It even feels good to hold. The centerpiece is the collection of great stories. Cary lets his subjects speak for themselves as he guides the reader through the details; he is the master of this technique.Five paws up."
1,Relaxing entertainment,I did not realise that this was just a book containing the 3 other professor books that I already own and have read.I would not have bought this had I been aware.
1,van damn this was terible,This would be the worst van dam movie I ever seen not a good plot. I am used to so much more from van dam that this movie was disappointing
3,not bad worth a look. like A.W.O.L.,VERY SIMALER TO A.W.O.L.IF YOU ARE A VAN DAMME FAN.YOU WILL LIKE IT.ALOT BETTER THAT KNOCK OFF
4,The Best 'Acting' Action film of recent memory,"In truth, I thought the end was here for Van Damme--his last few films were uninspired, humourless, shameless retreads of better films by worse actors. But Legionnaire redeems his oeuvre by ignoring him throughout much of the film, giving the best lines and most of the drama to a group of relatively unknown but excellent character actors. The editing is flawless, and let's face it; no director ever went broke by ripping off Lawrence of Arabia. I love Van Damme films, and I'm telling everybody to rent it because it's not a true Van Damme picture."
2,Good action shots but a pitiful storyline that yawns,"2.5 Stars because the action scenes are great, but the plot is simplistic and the semblance at drama pathetic, with irritating stabs of shallow sentimentalism and worn cliche. Worth renting but not worth buying unless you want good action shots and are a Van Damme fanatic. I will sell my DVD if I can. A previous review compares this to Glory, but I consider the comparison far-fetched, unless action is the sole criteria."
2,LegionnAire,"LegionnAire is really good but there is to much acting in it, it has really good action. Van Damme should stick with doing Katate movies not acting movies"
1,A GREAT IDEA WASTED,"VAn Damme's movies were going nowhere, each one worser than the last one ... Then a good idea came up: why don't try to make a kind of ""epic"" movie, taking a lengendary theme (the French unit called ""Foreigner Legion"" )and changing from the custumary scenario of karate kicks and sterotyphed villains who want to rule the world ? Great idea. I bought it. So, what disapointment after watching this.. it became clear that, no matter how many movies he has already made, Van Damme will never improve as an actor... EVery frame of the movie is wasted, making us think that he is being bad orientated by his agents or film-producers. IT's a totally unconving history, without pace and rhythm..."
4,VanDamme does right by the genre,"I grew up loving movies and books about the Foreign Legion; the misfit recruits, the brutal sergeants, the doomed stand against the odds in a lonely desert fort. So it was with some trepidation that I watched ""Legionnaire"". I had never previously watched a movie starring Jean-Claude van Damme, and I am no fan of martial arts movies. Would he mess it up with pointless anachronisms, a legionnaire/kick boxer? But I was happily surprised by this movie. All of the basic elements of a good Foreign Legion movie were present and the production values were first rate. The cast was strong, with all of the standard stereotypical misfits becoming Legionnaires with the Legion's ""Marche ou creve"" spirit. This film is by no means movie as great art, but it's solid, well done and entertaining. Movie as comfort food. I loved it."
4,DO NOT MISS LEGIONNAIRE,"VAN DAMME shows his another aspects through this movie. it contains humanity, friendship, frustration, and some good fight scenes. It is very worth seeing."
4,Very Good Movie,This is a very good Van Damme movie. It is not his best movie. But I would have to say it was his best acting. Great action scenes.
4,"A moving and touching film, with plenty of action","Van Damme scores big in this movie. Finally he has picked a movie with a decent supporting cast and a good story. Unlike previous films, Van Damme's kickboxing and martial arts skills are blended nicely with real life situations and drama. This movie deserved a theatrical release, the action is tasteful and the movie has a quick but meaningful pace. Some of the characters have some tired dialogue about being presecuted, but that aside the actors fit their roles. Overall the movie ranks among one of Van Dammes better emotional roles. Lionheart has the same tug on the heart strings, as well as the Legionaire angle."
3,one of van damme's better films,"van damme's performance is pretty good,better than i expected, the film looks great.absolutely worth the video buck."
4,"Good,but its not like his other movies","I went the store and i saw this movie on the counter and they had Van Damnes pic on it so i got it,i watched it,I wasnt pleased,i mean the movie was excellent,but where in the hell is Van Damnes high flying kicks,I am like a huge fan of Van Damne.This is like the only movie i didnt see him do his fancy kicks.This movie is worth watching,but if u wanna see his kicks dont get this one."
4,Jean-Claude goes epic/historical,"I heard the reason why this one didn't get a theater releases was because Van-Damme's previous ;""Knock-Off"" was a dud. ""Legionnaire"" is definitely one of his best. The movie has a great story that is very beautifully shot, with action sequences that are reminiscent of ""Glory"" and ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" The supporting cast also lends great acting and overall this movie must not be overlooked. This aint your usual ""kick-butt"" Van-Damme film , but very much better. Give this film a chance and you'll see why it deserves a theatre first audience. Also the DVD is well done with animated menus and tons of historical footage and documentaties about the Foriegn Legion."
4,A Real Good Legion Movie,"It's a shame this movie didn't have a theatrical release. It's one of the best Foreign Legion flicks around, and if its a bit short on plot it more than makes up for it with some very solid action sequences. Van Damme plays a 1920s boxer excaping to the Legion after double-crossing a crooked boxing promoter and losing his girlfriend in the process. The very-overated ""Beau Geste,"" by comparison, is definitely a better story-line, but Gary Cooper was way too old to play the title role and he's too wooden. Admittedly, Van Damme might not win an Oscar but he does a very good job as part of a solid ensemble cast of lesser-known actors playing the usual riff-raff joining the FFL: a black America, an Italian, a German, and a mysterious Englishman. Overall, see this one and ""March or Die,"" with Gene Hackman. It, too, has some great action sequences. ""Legionnaire"" is a good movie!"
4,"Not bad, actually","You don't watch Van Damme movies for the acting, realism or historical accuracy.With good reason.However, some predictable clichés and highly unlikely events aside, this film is pretty decent, has lots of action -which is what Van Damme does best - and is worth having if you're a Legion fan."
4,Surprisingly very good...,"This is not the typical chop-socky Van Damme flick. Heck, Van Damme doesn't even do his crescent kick, his cherished trademark. Instead, it's a war movie about the French Foreign Legion in 1925 that is sent to war in Africa. Van Damme plays Alain, a fugitive boxer who signs up with the Legion as a way of escape from gangsters. This all happens within the first 10 or so minutes. The large bulk of the film has Alain befriending his fellow legionnaires and learning the values of friendship even in a time of war. True, this movie is rather predictable and many of the characters seem cliche, but the cinematography, score and (surprisingly) acting are all above average. Even Van Damme pulls off a convincing performance, proving that when he's given a good script, he can be believable. The reason this $40 million film was never released in theaters was because of its downbeat ending. Don't be fooled by its direct-to-video nature, though. This is a good one for the war/action fan."
2,did not like it,"I purchased this book after I read the good reviews. I really did not like it. The story was dull, the heroine uninteresting and the hero not a hero at all (but just some idiot)."
3,too big from my little dog,"Overall, this had promise, and after trying the #1 size, I ordered the #0 size. I have a small skipperkee (about 10 lbs) that is able to easily slip out of the harness. She does not like it much and works to get it off her face. If this were a bit smaller, or my dog a bit larger, I think that it would work well."
5,Great fit for 70# lab mix,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a 70# lab-shar-pei mix. Even though this dog's head is a bit smaller than the one pictured on the front of the product, it fit perfectly and my friend has seen great results in her walks with her dog, who used to pull like mad, but is now behaving really well thanks to this little contraption."
5,This product is superior to the gentle leader!,"After our new furry family member chewed through two of the Gentle Leader collars in three months, I went in search of something new. We have had this collar now for over nine months and it is still in one piece. The nose loop does not slip off like with the other collar, so he can't eat it! And even if he managed to do so - the material is thicker and stronger. Our dog is a 75 lb lab/bulldog mix, who can out-pull me or my husband on a standard neck collar. But this head collar really minimizes his ability and desire to pull. I can control him with two fingers on the leash - HUGE difference! LOVE this one!"
5,Love it,"I bought the Halti brand first... This brand is better... has a soft piece of material that goes over the nose of your pet.. This is the best thing I could have purchased for my dogs.. It DEFINITELY WORKS... I have 2 strong-willed Boxers that try to control me... but this product is a lifesaver... Thank you, thank you, thank you !!!!"
2,could not get my dog to wear it,"i tried everything but he hated it. it was a no go. even though i set it to a snug fit, he kept pawing at it until he was finally able to get it into his mouth and chew on it."
3,Dog chewed it pretty easily,"So about the second time we used this, our golden retriever chewed almost through a part of this which would have rendered it useless. That said, it could be considered our fault, I'm not positive. We followed the directions, and the collar actually works pretty well overall (meaning the dog pulls and it jerks his head to the side a bit and really irritates him), but he can still get that one part off his nose and get it in his mouth. Also when we walk and don't use this collar, he is still just as bad and pulls as ever."
4,Stops the pulling,"Purchased the small for our 27lb Jack Russell. He was constantly pulling with a standard collar - to the point where quick-pulling back on him to correct him looked like animal abuse. He initially tried to back out of this collar, but got used to it fairly quickly. He does try to paw at it from time to time, but only when we're not moving, (ie, when he has time to think about it). We had one of these years ago for a lab that pulled like a freight train. They work. Now we have very calm walks."
4,Runs very large,"I knew from reading other reviews that the sizing runs large. The company suggested a size 3 for my 40 lb English setter, so I ordered the 2 based on reviews. It's still too big! I can't believe we need a size 1. Otherwise, I love the design. Much better than the premiere gentle leader, which slides up the nose into the eyes and rubs."
4,Good tool to help with pulling,Definitely too big for my 10 pound yorkie. I was able to tighten it around her neck by sewing it and now it works great. It takes a while for the dog to get used to but makes such a difference when walking her!
3,Fit issues,"It's really hard to gauge if this is going to fit your dog properly without trying one on. We bought what should be the right size for our dog, but she can pull it off so easily, it just doesn't work for us.I guess my recommendation would be to try one on in the store before committing to it."
1,Imitation Brand,"They sent an imitation; Holt from china instead of the advertised Halti, and it cut my dog's face! I tried contacting them, but no response."
4,Our Shiba Inu finally behaves. Mostly.,"Tycho is twice the size of a normal Shiba, currently 38 pounds and purebred. He's a rescue, re-homed due to his anxiety issues getting him into trouble. This head halter gives us confidence that we can keep him under control no matter how scared he gets or how many delicious cats he sees. Tycho does know how to throw off the head halter when he's upset, but that doesn't matter. The halter is securely connected to his collar, and by the time he's tossed one, we've caught him by the other and he's safely under control.If you have concerns about pulling during walks or your dog slipping his collar, this is a great solution. It may take a couple tries to get the right size, but the effort is well worth it."
2,Disappointing,"At first, I was happy with the product because my dog wasn't pulling nearly as hard as before. But then I noticed that the side strap pushes up into her eye, making it water and become irritated, when we walk. I tried fixing the problem but nothing worked, it kept going into her eye. The product was definitely a waste of money."
5,Great product - Must have!,"My dog is a puller and I being a petite woman with a bad back found it difficult walking my spunky 65 lb lab. Prior to purchasing the Holt, I had been using the Gentle Leader from Premier and truly liked it. Both collars are similarly designed. The only dislike I had with the Gentle Leader was with the nose loop. It didn't have the supportive cushion my dog required leaving her skin very raw.The Holt collar is designed with a cushioned nose-band which adds extra protection.What I did appropriate with the Premier Gentle Leader was the informative DVD they provided that instructed how to properly fit the collar to the dog and how to properly use it.Transitioning between the two leaders was minimal to nothing. I would recommend either one of these products, they are a life saver!!!"
4,works,really work as they said it would instant control. nice walking a dog that doesn't pull you off your feet the moment you go out the door. longer walks more at ease
1,It's a fake,"The collar actually works fine but it's not a Halti. It's a 'Holt"" Looks and works the same but it's not a Halti which is what I was ordering."
4,Coastal Holt Dog Walking collar,"This dog walking collar really made a difference. My dog was pulling alot and I wasn't enjoying the walk. I couldn't wait to get home from the walk. Now, we go sometimes twice the distance we used to as she is not pulling. There is a side piece that hangs down that sometimes my dog can put her paw through and get the collar off. But I have started wrapping that piece around her neck collar so that doesn't distract her. I would definitely recommend this collar if you have a dog that pulls during their walk."
5,Perfect size 3 for doberman/shepherd mix,"What a great invention! Not only it fits on my doberman/german shepherd mix dog, it also works! My dog tends to pull during the walk, especially when she sees another dog. This training collar distracts her from pulling because it is positioned under her mouth. She did not like it initially and tried to take it off, but then she concentrated on the walk itself.Another nice feature of this collar is that it is adjustable in the front under her nose, so if it is hot outside and the dog has to pant she can open her mouth.The collar is supposed to attach to a regular collar that the dog wears all the time, although I used it as a single collar on my dog."
3,"It works, but it is too fragile","I really liked this thing at first, but after a few walks my dog chewed the part that goes underneath his snout.."
1,Broke on second use,I was excited because the collar seemed to work. My dog obviously didn't like it and tried to paw it off but as long as I kept moving he only occasionally pawed it and didn't pull. He usually pulls nearly constantly despite my efforts. However half way through my second walk my 23 pound dog stopped to sniff something. I kept going and the strap that goes around his nose broke. Don't waste your money.
3,My dog chewed through it the first time I put it on her.,I turned around for half a second and my 8 mo. puppy had part of it in her mouth and chewed right through it.
2,Didnt last long,"The strap only lasted one day. Tied my labradoodle up outside a shop and when I came back he had chewed threw the bottom strap. The funny thing was he was just sitting waiting for me like nothing had happend, even though his lead was detached to where I tied him. I think the strap around the snout is too big and needs to be adjustable. I will get the next size down and see how we go with that."
3,Worked Well Until My Dog Got Smart,"This was the second Halti I purchased for two different dogs. The Halti worked very well with the first dog (a Staffordshire terrier). However, even though it was properly fitted to her head, the second dog (a bull terrier) figured out how to chew her way through the strap that went around her snout. Thank goodness for the safety loop! The company's ""unconditional guarantee"" does not cover this type of damage."
3,Worked well until my dog chewed it!,"I've finally learned my lesson. Today my dog chewed through her third Halti-- all while they were on her! She chewed through the last one in under a minute while I had my back to her tending to my daughter. I haven't contacted the company about it, yet.They work great but are NOT durable."
3,Halti Sizing,"Service from seller was excellent. Halti sizing, however, was not. I went by my dog's weight (65 lbs) and purchased a size 3. It slips off her head with no problem & cannot be tightened anymore. Maybe the size should be based on circumference of the head? Very disappointed since I cannot use this product and return postage plus replacement postage would be about the price of a new one."
1,Sizing instructions are off,The Halti must be correctly sized - and unfortunately the sizing info to determine the correct size is poor. The Holt sizing chart is based on breeds - and didn't work for my mutt. Way too big. Why don't they provide the sizing info based on the circumference of the muzzle and neck?
1,Not good for small dogs like lhasas,"This is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware! Because of their flatter facial structures, the collar slips off and won't hold as it should. And speaking from experience, the size is not the issue i.e. even a small size won't work."
5,LOVE THIS WALKING COLLAR,This walking collar has the greatest design. I do not have to have great upper body strength to control my excited boxer. She walks next to me like she is supposed to. No more pulling me down the street. Bravo
5,simply magick!!! perfect pictures and no extra cost,"I cannot estimate the endless fortune this will save me. I have a SLR and developed my own film, till I got so tired of the darkroom and the cost! Still, having it developed even from 'quickie' mail order sites cost a fortune. Worse, when you are trying to take a good picture of kitty and she goes zoom zoom zoom and ruin nearly a whole roll of film you want to scream. With this, pop it into my camera and click all day. I held on to my SLR for so long because I felt there was no way something so simply could have such quality! Wow!the colours are true, the images brilliant and SO SHARP. Too a picture of kitty four foot away and you could see a flea on her nose in the picture!Get a good camera like the Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom, get one of these cards and takes 100s of pictures. It puts the fun back in taking pics!!"
3,Wish I could rate it,"I payed extra for the next day delivery and four days later, Im still waiting. Next time I won't use Amazon."
1,Not compatible with all Smart Media devices,"Although this card fit well into my Rio500 MP3 player, I had to call Simpletech's 800 # and punch through a long phone tree to reach a helpful technician. He explanined that Rio 500's can't take more than 64MB, so I'll have to send it back and pay for shipping.Find a way to verify compatibility before ordering."
2,SimpleTech SmartMedia is slower than other brands,"I have three brands of SmartMedia cards: SimpleTech, Viking, and the Olympus card that came with my camera. I timed how long it took to copy the same 5MB file to each card. The result: the other cards took 32 seconds and the SimpleTech took 38 seconds. So, my results show that the SimpleTech is about 18% slower than the others. That's important to me because when I take action shots I'm often waiting for the previous image to write to disk before I can take the next shot."
1,Worst Alternate Idea,"This is the latest in the stargate movies, the plot is that the stargate has captured their most dangerous enemy and they are preparing the trial for the crimes committed, however he tells things will change, somehow he manages to change the time when the stargate was not found and the team was not formed as we all know.While the idea is very good, I'm sorry to say the movie was profoundly very tedious, not as exciting as I hoped. So if you want alternate universes please check Star Trek Deep Space Nine or the books in which the idea is used.As this movie Sorry Stargate fans it is not worth it."
2,disappointed,"I've seen better episodes on TV. Forgettable, don't even remember what it was about and it wasn't long ago that I saw it."
3,Much better than Ark of Truth,"After rushing out to buy the ""Ark of truth"" and being bitterly disappointed, this was a nice surprise. It has the familiar feel of the series that we all loved, and was cleverly written. The story keeps you hopping, and promises to be one that we pull off our shelf to watch on a regular basis. The only downside will be upsetting the dust off of the Ark of Truth, sitting next to it...."
4,SG1 Continuum,"As an SG1 fan, I enjoyed the episode very much. People new to the series might have some trouble keeping up; however, isn't that what the DVD sets are for<Grin>.I can't wait for the next one... (That's a HINT!)"
1,This is the single worst quality blu-ray I have seen yet.,"The movie was ok, as much as a let down as 200 was, but at least it was ok.Blu-ray on a decent TV makes this thing look like utter and complete crap.I returned it to the store to get the DVD because at least that doesn't look as bad.The lack of quality on the picture makes me ashamed to be a fan."
1,Bad return service,I was shipped two when I order only one! The return menu did not have a selection that covered the return and I was charged shipping to return the extra item!
4,Every Stargate Fan Will Love This One,"A real action-packed adventure. There's never a dull moment in Stargate Continuum. I'd love to give you more details but seeing how it hasn't been released yet, today is July 3rd, I don't want to spoil it for my fellow Stargate brothers and sisters.This is definitely a must have for your collection. You won't be disappointed, at least not much. However, I didn't like how one character had to make a sacrifice in the end. Aside from that, I'm very happy with this movie."
5,"If you liked StarGate at all, you'll want to see Continuum. GREAT movie.","I hope they keep making these direct-to-DVD Stargate films. The TV show was outstanding and I loved all ten seasons. The previous ""Ark of Truth"" direct-to-DVD movie was terrific and this one maintains the high production quality, storyline and acting.Somehow, they managed to get practically all of the actors portraying the various heros and villians over the years back together for the story. For example, there are lots of cameos by all the best ""System Lords"" we loved to hate in the TV show.If you're a Stargate fan, you won't want to miss this.My only regret is that I just bought the DVD last week for $15 at Best Buy when I could've rented it here for $3.99, but at least the DVD includes a few hours of bonus material about the production.Two Kentucky thumbs up to the Stargate cast and crew!"
2,Stargate Continuum,Not bad but could have been a lot better. Overall it was dissapointing. They could have at least noted what happened to the Ori after leaving fans hanging with the series ending. Not worth buying.
2,stargate continuum,the story is without a bunchline and not as good as the others stargates that I have bought
5,Great movie.,If you are a fan of the Stargate series and want to see an end to the series as a movie this is a great movie and a must see and I got this fast after ordering it.
4,great,It was a good movie for sci fi people who have already seen the stargate series. came to our house quickly
5,Great Closing to stargate sg1,Wonderful movie to close the stargate sg1 saga. A must see for your whole family. Guaranteed wonder and amusement once again
3,Little let down by this show,"I love the entire stargate series but this one was a bit of a letdown overall. Ohh well, at least I have it to complete my collection on the shelf. Wife loves that :P"
4,Continuum review,A nice conclusion to SG1. It was great to see RDA back. It cleared up the last open issue left from TAOT.
4,Enjoyed it BUT --- SPOILERS,"This review contains spoilers. Do not read if you don't want to know what's in the film.I liked the move because I love Stargate. I love its characters. However,---The movie was completely lacking in emotional exploration of the characters. Delving into the character impact of separation and isolation in an alternate reality, and in the case of Daniel, the loss of a limb, might have added 10 minutes of time, but it would have significantly improved the movie. I'm tired of lazy, sloppy writing. Stargate is a great show for its themes and characters (and actors, all of them) but it has been poorly treated by its writers. This show needs to be given to someone else, someone who gives a d@#m about art."
5,Continuum makes the grade!,"A fan since the beginning I've seen every show there was..loved the final 2 hour wrap up of StarGate, even if you never watched a show, this would be fun for some who like Sci-Fi! I enjoyed several of the fun things Ben Browder slipped in while taking Command of the starship... and the fact that many of our past ""bad guys"" come back for one last peek.. Love owning this... nothing like a rainy day with some snacks and a great Stargate to watch!"
2,Stunk,I am a die hard stargate fan...this movie was really bad....wish that stargate would stop taking advantage of its loyal fan base by making this straight to DVD movies....end the series or put in back on the air...(i would have much prefered to pay $10 to go see on big screen vs buying the expensive dvd.)
3,Another episode made movie,"I did like it a lot, but will not considered it a mouvie this is anothe episode but put in a mouvie format was hoping for more."
3,episode,"Although the quality of the film was great, the acting great, and the special effects amazing, the story was like that of one of the episodes. It was interesting, but not movie material. However it was good to see the team back in action. Maybe next time they will do a mini-series, and something that doesnt involve the way over done (and now officially cheesy) theme of time travel, or parallel universes."
3,"Not the best but still good,...yea still good",It wasn't as great as the ark of truth. But i believe its because you had a whole season to get into the story and this was pretty much a movie that could have been a two part episode. It is still utterly enjoyable. for fans who have been here since the first sg-1 episode you will enjoy having Jack back. Hes back and he's his witty self. Love the Ba'al and Jack banter its AWESOME. I think if you watched any of the behind the scenes stuff you'll be a little to expectant but if you haven't you may enjoy it more. For the big fans i def reccomend especially if you missed seening jack-goa'uld-daniel banter.
3,Where's O'Neil?,"TV ad led me to believe O'Neil (Anderson) would be ""Leading the SG Team..."" - false advertising at the least! Story is better than ""Ark"" but I was expecting more from my favorite character!"
3,Enjoy this...,"Enjoy this for what it is, a longer, extended episode. It has a lot of flaws, but it also has some of the magic of the old SG-1 stories, if not all too familiar. If you don't really care about collecting the movies or anything, I recomment renting or borrowing from a friend rather than buying this for 20 dollars."
3,Stargate SG-1 Reunion,"They should change the title to ""Stargate Reunion"". Re-hash of old story lines and return of many SG characters. It's like compiling several scripts form different episodes. Dissapointed with the writers and I feel the price I paid is not worth watching. If you can get it cheaper, buy it, if not rent it. It's one of theose ""watch it once"" movies."
3,Not the best,"It was an interesting spin on an alternate time-line; however, it isn't a movie that I would watch over and over again. I must say I was a little disappointed. The upside of the movie is there is closure on one of the longer running story lines."
3,Not Quite What I was Hoping For,"The producers and writers hyped this show as going back to the older, early season feel of SG-1. I think this movie would have been better as a series of episodes rather than a full-length movie. The plot was OK but I thought the ending was very rushed and a bit of a cheat. Granted, this is a matter of personal preference but I was also disappointed that Claudia Black did not get more screen time."
2,"Borrow, don't buy!","A very predictable thrown-together movie to make a few more bucks from an otherwise outstanding series. Better than ""Ark of Truth"",but not much."
5,Great Movie,"Loved seeing Jack again, this is for all of the stargate addicts! I'm not a big fan of the new SG1leader but the movie is still a good watch"
3,A somewhat longer weekly SG-1 episode,"I have to agree with those other reviewers here who thought this movie wasn't quite up to the standards of a feature-length movie. I expected a bit more. However, considering that it is the second Stargate 'feature film' this year, maybe I expected too much. After all, the writers are pitching a fit about having to come up with 20 episodes a year for TV series these days. The first few seasons of SG-1 contained at least 22 episodes each; and DS9 seasons typically contained 24 episodes or more! It's a tough life writing Sci-Fi I guess.I also agree that Continuum is certainly a better movie than The Ark of Truth. Based upon both of these flicks, it looks like we're being treated to Stargate SG-1 Season 11 in roughly 1 1/2 hour episodes about every four months. I wonder what the November 2008 episode will entail..."
5,Wow! Great Movie,"What a great addition to the SG-1 series. This is one of the best stories of the series. I've watched it twice and am eager for a third time.It's great to see Jack back, of course. The story line kept me guessing, and the action scenes were very good and not overdone. The CG is absolutely amazing and fits in without looking gimicky.This movie really brought me back to the feel of the first few series, yet we have characters that span all 10 series. I think everyone from the writers, actors, and production crew were spot on with this movie."
5,Excellent indeed !,"When I saw it first time I was under the impression that I was looking at some Oscar prize movie so I had to seen it once more just after ending... Sometime after first 25-30 minutes of the second view I realize that is on DVD... so no Oscar, too bad. It's better than the ""ARK"", better than ""Children of the Gods"" sometimes better than first one ""Stargate"" (Kurt Russel). Rick is great again, as usual... What can I say, it's not only for Stargate fans, it's for anyone and anything...It's just great. And I guess right now O'Neill asked ... what?!"
5,Sure hope this is not the end of the road!,"Really enjoyed this. Got it a couple of weeks ago and have watched it twice already, actually did a whole SG1 thing with this film and The Ark of Truth this past weekend, told the wife is was all based on fact, so she left me alone. Sure hope this is not the end of it all. Anyway this film and 'The Ark of Truth' are well worth the money and you will not be sorry you bought them."
5,None stop action with a twist,"From the opening scene, until you realize the movie is already over, this is a great film. Very well done, and worthy of having in a collection for Stargate SG1 junkies!"
4,Above expectation,The entertainament quality is above the average of the series SG1. I think this film reached the quality level of Stargate Atlantis.
5,Miss the series,"I was very upset when they took this series off the air. I'm glad to have these movies but still wish the series was still around, Love this movie."
3,"Blu-Ray ""Quality"" Sucks.","Save your money, they cheaped out big time on the blu-ray version. The picture quality is horrible. Shame on them for ripping off fans like this!!!! We pay $**.**, and then an extra $10 bucks on top of that to get the blu-ray high quality, and what they deliver is a pixelated grainy so-called ""movie"" that's no better than a double-episode of the TV series, at a price approaching that of an entire season on DVD."
1,DisCONTINUUM immediately!,"The producers of this franchise know they have a great fan base, but now after several years of making an intelligent and entertaining sci-fi series I think they've given in to intellectual laziness. If ""Continuum"" is the new standard of what we (the fans) can expect to see in the future from this franchise, then they should just stop making these films now. The plot to ""Continuum"" is silly, the narrative (the story and how it is told) is completely bland and devoid of life. It was as though all these characters we have come to know, suddenly had their souls written out of the script."
3,Stargate - Continuum,OK film. First time viewed. Don't need to see it again. More my wife's thing...
2,"My least favorate episode,or movie of any stargate","I've seen every Stargate SG1 and Atlantis Episodes and movie.The reason I didn't like it was the one thing I loved about the shows that for the most part, they were clean. This one had a couple almost goryscenes. Not to mention the swearing was like star trek 4 and 5, were all of the sudden your Heroes of many years start having potty mouths, it's so unnecessary. I was looking forward to an all new sg1 were they tackle something new, not a rehash of the same old thing. It seems like The industry is turning to the Dark side again with the success of an over the top Dark Knight being so succesful, the feel good adventure will need a comeback. Please bring the SG1 team back for a good adventure!"
1,Not satisfied,I purchased Stargate continium and when I received it they sent me Steel magnolias instead I have contacted the company 3 times anf=d after 3 weeks I have heard nothing I will not purchasing anything through Amazon again or its partners
2,"Fun movie, bad Blu-Ray","I should have gone with the DVD. The image quality on this is the worst of any Blu-Ray in my collection. It looks like a DVD, actually. That said, it bogs down my HTPC more than any other Blu-Ray in my collection. It stops, lurches, and the sound gets really out of sync. It also flips out completely for a few frames here and there and displays a randomly colored pixelated image.The movie itself is a good rompin' episode of the sci fi classic. But save your money and get the DVD.UPDATE: I upgraded the firmware on my LG drive and it solved most of the issues with this disc. The lurching/stuttering/syncing problems are gone. It still goes bonkers with the pixelated image from time to time. For the most part, the disc is now watchable. But it's still a very disappointing Blu-Ray."
5,Stargate Pleaser,"If you are a Stargate fan, then this movie is a must for you. When a couple of the team begin to disappear into thin air the remaining team hits the Stargate and end up in a 20th century when the Stargate has not yet been invented. We have all of our favorite and familiar characters who, of course, go to the North Arctic and Russia to find the frozen Stargate, make things work allowing them to return to their own time and things are made right and all is right with the world. We watched this as a Prime Member free through our computer/TV 60"" monitor. Wonderful."
2,pleasent fluff,"this was pleasent and satifying fluff. It's always worth while to watch Baal's machinations, but it would have played better as an episode.Sorry I can't say more."
2,Old plots with very little action.,"Not for my taste. ""Stargate: Continuum"" has a very old plot that has been reused over and over again in both ""Stargate SG-1"" as well as in sci-fi stories in general. The first half is lacking in action, and you don't see much of O'Neill in this one. He shows up in the first few minutes of the film and the last few, but that's it. And the story is lacking in structure. The second half of the movie wasn't that bad, but still not worth wasting your money on.Not recommended!"
2,Blu-ray quality same as upconverted DVD,"The quality of the image compression was the same as the up-converted DVD of Ark of Truth I just watched a few days before. There was no comparison in watching the Arctic scenes (so-so) vs Planet Earth Blu-Ray (great). Not sure why they'd even release this as blu-ray unless they're pulling a fast one.The story had holes in it bigger than the gate itself. When time changed, people were disappearing like Back to the Future style. poof? The paradoxes are ridiculous.. like why is Baal able to travel back and stop the stargate from arriving in the US. if he did that, he wouldn't know about Earth in the first place. where did Baal get Anubis's ship? how did Daniel's leg reappear? why make mitchell the hero? you'd think for a $7mil budget, they'd pull a better script together.I think the only thing I enjoyed was Vala as a villain."
3,Stargate,Since I'm a huge Stargate fan it's always fun to see this group together.But I have to admit it was a bit booring und the subject was about the same as in some other episodes. Back to the Future.
2,Close but no cigar,"This movie includes all of the traditional ""Stargate"" favorites, from Jack O'Neill to General Landry, but without the humor that made the series so enjoyable. It plays as though the writers and the director had a checklist instead of a script. Quip for Oneill-check, Brilliant insight by Carter-check, Moral stance for Daniel Jackson-check. None of the elements are truely integrated. Watching this convoluted tale was a large disappointment."
4,Great night entertainment,"Another SG-1 mega-episode keeping with the SG-1 tradition. If you liked the TV show, this should also please you. It wasn't something that would do well at the movie theater, but for the price, it is a great night's entertainment. Enjoyable. Sad to see some of the actors in their last SG-1 role (General Hammond, for example), and nice to see some of the other actors from the privious episodes that we haven't seen for a LONG time. I recomend it."
5,coolest movie ever!!!!!,"i have the entire stargate sg-1 box set and the ark of truth movie... this one is my favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the continued story line of the evil but suave gould Bal is just so well crafted and keeps you on the edge of your seat/sofa/bean bag... what ever your setting on:) if you are a huge sg-1 fan, you have to watch this!"
5,MOVIE STARGATE CONTINUUM,Movie arrived quickly. Just as good as new. A+++++++Surpassed my expectations. Bought the movie cheaper than what I could have rented it.
4,Stargate Continuum - Enjoyable movie,"It was a very enjoyable movie, nice to see so many familiar faces, even if some only make a cameo appearance, like Colin Cunningham.I liked the story, timetravel & alternate realities are always fun. Good quality picture and very impressive scenes on the Arctic. I hope we get to see of these movies. Good to see Don S Davis once more as General Hammond, we will miss him."
5,great item,"SG1 Continuum, is a great movie. The CGI is flawless and over all a great movie. I hope it isn't the last MGM does."
2,This rice cooker is a disappointment to Asia!,"my rice cooker of 10 years just crapped out and i read bunch of reviews and that really didn't help me. since this got so many reviews and most of them good i ordered it and the price is right. well, it makes rice but if you eat rice every day but don't want to make it every day then this rice cooker isn't for you. the steamer plug thing kicks back tons of water back into the pot so you get this really really wet spot. then there is this hot spot so it starts to burn and the bottom starts to get really crispy a couple of hours into the warm position. then after about 12 hours it starts to get this wet rag smell. gross!!"
1,Not Good,"Too Expensive. 5- 1/2 cups are not true, you can barely make 3.5 cups. Every time you cook, you need to clean outlet also, that sucks. I don't recommend this product. You can do better with 1/3 rd of money what you spend on this product."
3,Warming,This is a good cooker but it will only keep rice warm for 12 hours and then it burns it. Does a good job cooking.
5,Great cooker,"This is my first rice cooker...it was rated one of the best as I did my research and decided to buy based on feedback from other owners. I must say that I totally agree with the majority of owners, its a fantastic product. The cooker is easy to use, easy to clean and delivers a reliable pot of rice every time. I have no idea what would make a cooker better, but for the average person, I doubt you will need anything more than this...you can have TOTAL confidence that you made the right choice when you hit the 'add to cart' button."
3,"Basic rice cooker, doesn't do brown rice without prep work.","This is just a basic rice cooker that has a vegetable steamer insert. It does not have a brown rice setting. If you want to make brown rice, you have to soak it overnight. Not ideal for a busy lifestyle. Also, the water level measurement lines on the inner bowl are very hard to see since they are the same gray-black color as the rest of the bowl."
4,great product,"A little small for a crowd, but for a small family a perfect rice cooker. Makes perfect rice and super easy clean up.Better than my last cooker all the is rice cooked evenly and keeps the rice warm without making it crunchy on the bottom."
2,Not worth the money...,"After a cheap rice cooker I had for years died, I thought I would upgrade and get this one. I wish I had heeded some of the reviews I saw on here. First of all, it is difficult to read the water level lines on the inside of the pot. I am young and thought it couldn't be that bad. It is. I have to hold the pot directly under a light to see the markings at all. Also, I often find that my rice is not cooked through when the cooker indicates it is finished. The final straw for me is that it is pretty cumbersome to clean. If it made perfect rice, the cleanup wouldn't be an issue, but I'm not sure that the rice in this cooker has ever turned out as good as the cheap one I used to have that I picked up at Target. I am now going back to a cheaper model - don't want to spend a bunch of money to end up with a dud again."
3,Okay,"I had really high hopes for this, me being asian myself. I used to use some of the older models of Tiger that was sold at the typical Asian Supermarket. Those are very expensive though. This cooks rice very well. The only thing is that I don't think it has proper ventilation and the rice starts getting soggy after only being warmed for an hour or so. I will keep looking for a better one, otherwise just drop the big bucks for the ones at the local grocery store, sigh."
2,defective after 1 month,Cooked rice fine for the first month then suddenly burned out for no apparent reason. I didn't even have a chance to try out the porridge/soup cooker and steamer functions. Now I will have to ship it back to Sanyo for a replacement unit.
2,Huge disappointment!,"I was so excited to finally be getting a rice cooker stateside! But I hate this one. Here are the reasons:1) No handles for the pot. I can't take the pot for the rice out without using a potholder or towel. There are no handles for easy lifting in and out.2) Pot is not secure. When I want to get my rice out, I have to use a towel or potholder to hold onto the pot because it won't stay still when I'm scooping out my rice.3) No beep for finished rice. Why isn't there a beep or a noise to indicate when the rice is done cooking?4) Over-warms rice. I left the cooker on with rice in it overnight, and instead of being yummy the next morning, it was mostly dried out and hard. What a waste of rice!In retrospect, I should have shipped my original rice cooker back with me from Japan. It had all these features, and I got it third-hand. Pay the extra money to get a real Japanese one, not an import."
1,You cannot make sushi with rice made from this rice cooker.,The quality of rice is inadequate to satisfy anyone who likes sushi. I am really surprised that Sanyo makes such bad quality product. I returned the product.
2,Easy Rice,"I am very happy that I purchased this rice cooker.It is easy to use ,brainless- just add water,rice and forget about. It is extremely convenient and makes excellent rice. Guests have asked how we cooked the rice because it was perfect."
1,one time cooker,This rice cooker is good for one time cooking. The rice does not last more than 12 hours. I usually leave my rice for 4 days so that I do not have to keep cooking it (lazy). I returned it and bought Cukoo rice cooker (made in Korea). The rice lasts for 4 days without changing color or get old. Cukoo is more expensive but it will last for years.
1,Don't like this at all...,"I bought this because it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated and I've had excellent results from most of their recommendations. Not so with this one. I have major issues with the unit's cleanability. The lid is hinged and is not removable for easy cleaning. The inside of the lid had a scale on it after cooking and I was hesitant to clean it thoroughly because it seemed to be something of a mystery substance and I was afraid that I would scratch it. There is a trough that catches condensation and is also difficult to clean. Likewise with the extremely flimsy gasket. The unit took longer to clean properly than it did to make the rice, and I prefer the old Aroma rice cooker that I bought this to replace."
3,Cooks well a pain to clean,"This product is too dificult to clean in comparison to the cheap but effective simpler rice cookers. Since the lid is attached and there are many nooks and crannies to clean including a rubber gasket,cleanup is a pain"
5,Perfect Cooker,This is one of the best electrical items that I have in my home. It cooks steel oatmeal as well as rice. All these cooked perfectly. It is a breeze to clean and is small and portable. I loved it so much I bought one for my married daughter in Minneapolis. AND she loves it too. I use it at least 2-3 times a week.
1,non-stick coating peel off after 6 month,"I don't like this rice cooker because the inner pot's non-stick coating peel off after 6 month, and there's no way to replace it. My last Panasonic rice cooker's non-stick coating lasted 5 years."
4,Great steamer/rice cooker!,Very easy to use...and a good size. Only negative is cleaning the back and top 'valve' area.
5,Excellent cooker,"I've always cooked rice in a saucepan on a stovetop before but got tired of the pan bubbling over all the time. This cooker is great. It is capable of making quite small amounts of rice too. I routinely cook about one-half a cup of rice in it and it turns out great. Brown rice needs to be soaked for six hours or longer prior to cooking or it really won't turn out very good but that is usually recommended anyway. I use one rounded half-cup brown rice that has been soaked, rinsed and drained, and two-thirds cup water, letting it stand for fifteen minutes while still covered after the cooking cycle is complete. It turns out fluffy and perfect every time. Very easy to clean too, just a quick wipe of the inside cover with a damp sponge, pop out the steam vent and rinse it off, and wash the inner basin with a non-abrasive sponge or cloth. I couldn't possibly be happier with this cooker, I use it nearly every day."
4,Sanyo Rice cooker,"The only problem that I have with this rice cooker is that the directions were not written very well. Once we deciphered the instructions, the Sanyo has been great to use."
4,Good Value,"Almost anything would have been an improvement over the Aroma rice cooker my new Sanyo replaces. It's easy to use and produces consistently excellent rice every time - and as I was raised by a Japanese mom, I'm kind of a snob in this regard. I agree with complaints that the unit's design doesn't accommodate easy cleaning, but if cleanup is done immediately after each use, it's not too much of a chore. If you allow the accumulated starch to dry in the nooks & crannies around the lid & the closure, it'll be a royal pain."
4,good cooker,"Had a basic B&D cooker before, this is one step up from that IMO. The size is nice to have more leftover rice for the next dinner. It is easy to clean but the switch sometimes doesn't work and twice the rice wasn't cooking, just on warm. So now I just double check 5-10 min after. Works well for brown rice."
5,Yuki,"It's easy to use. It's easy to clean up. Functions are simple to understand. I haven't had it for long, so, I don't know anything about it's durability yet."
1,"ok, while it lasted....","It was ok, unless I left it on warm and the rice caked onto the bottom terribly. However, it stopped working after 4 months of use. Not sure what happened...."
4,Great little machine.,Very easy to use while you are preparing the rest of your meal. Trouble free operation is the key word here.
3,only lasts a year and half,"I bought it in September 2011, and now Jan 2013 it is broken. Maybe it is because it did't clean it up every time after using it.I'm wondering how to fix it."
4,"darned, good rice cooker","i'd read/ researched much before purchasing this item. checked ""Consumer Reports"" as well as read many reviews about his particular model. most were helpful/ spot on: this is probably the best little bugger out there on the market today for the price (which we thought was reasonable). i'd have given 5/5 stars be it not for the pesky, little, plastic condensation capturer-thingy-device on the back of the unit. it does its job OK but is a bit of a struggle to get re-situated in place after emptying, cleaning, etc. it cooks rice to perfection, clean-up is a breeze, etc. however, the plastic spoon that comes w/ the product doesn't fit very well into the resting ""slot"" affixed to the side of the top lid. other than those two, slight ""inconveniences"", the product is terrific."
4,Works as Advertised,"Being Japanese-American, I have been raised around rice cookers since birth. The old models my family used had the lid bobbing on the steam being generated; the rice was perfect regardless. The ""fancy"" models now being sold for over a $100 are overkill. This machine follows the ""KISS"" principle to a T. While the lid doesn't bobble anymore due to the vent, it works fine. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that I cannot see the water level markings. They are the same color as the non-stick coating."
4,My first rice cooker-it's great,"This is my first rice cooker. Always used the stove top method before. I only cook for two so this little cooker is perfect. It wipes up with a wet paper towel. It does not seem to be made for cooking large quantities of rice. some of the reviews complain about it being hard to clean, i'm guessing they cook large quantities and it boils up onto the top of the cooker.It is perfect for two people. I'd buy it again."
1,Broke!,"This worked well for about 4 months and then broke. Its mechanism turns to ""warm"" now way before the rice is done. When I called the company to ask about service or an exchange, I got someone one time. I had to call back with more information from the receipt and I have never been able to get a hold of someone since then. I have called about 8 other times. It is not worth my time to keep trying to get a hold of someone, pay to send it to a service person, etc. Since this item is well reviewed in Cook's Illustrated, I am debating buying another and crossing my fingers..."
5,I like it,"Before your first time of cooking, you have to hold the rice cook in your chest and wash the inside of the lid under hot water from the tap. I didn't do that until my third time cooking. The first two were terrible with my cooked rice filled with awful plastic smell. After I washed the lid with flowing hot water from the tap, I don't get any plastic smell in my rice any more. The manual should have that instruction. Also I tried to cook my porriage with the lid shut, it is also OK. So far I'm satisfied with it. If it has timing, it would be perfect."
4,Excellent product!,Cooks rice (including brown rice) very well. I also tried quinoa and that came out well too. It is very easy to operate and clean. Only problem is that the exterior gets quite hot.
4,"Very illuminating, enjoyable book","There aren't too many English-language histories of inter-war Poland, so this book is very welcome. It is easy to read and provides many interesting details on subjects (often regarded these days as obscure) such as inter-war Danzig and Poland's troubled relations with Lithuania and Cezchoslovakia. In many ways, it is popular history more than academic history: it has little to say on the inter-war economy and social structure of Poland. Its account of Polish diplomacy could be a little more rigorous, but the author, though clearly sympathetic to Poland, does not flinch awkward facts. One drawback is that the book hardly draws at all on modern research."
4,my kind of musiq,"This album probably ain't worth the 4 stars I gave it, but damn it I just like Musiq. His music is so damn soothing, it just calms me down no matter what mood I'm in. He gets love for this album just like the other ones I own. Plus, the boy gets more and more like Stevie Wonder everytime I here him. Everything on this cd lives up to his artistic vision. He has features from some other philly soulstars like Bilal, and one of my personal favorite characters, ATL's Cee-Lo. The top tracks on this are Forthenight, Momentinlife, Dontstop, Soulstar, and Womanopoly. Womanopoly especially caught my ear, cause when I heard he had a song playin on Monopoly the game, I thought it would be cake. And I wasn't feelin it at first but it grew on me cuz it's so catchy and original."
5,"mu-sic , n.: Musiq Soulchild","This is the first album I've heard from Musiq and my breath was taken away. The man of neo-soul created a great 3rd album. With songs like Whereareyougoing, Youloveme, Womanopoly, Thereason, there is no doubt that Musiq is music's prodigal son."
4,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT,"I have to say that this Musiq's best cd so far. His lyrics are just so...real. Unlike rappers... he doesn't sing about the same thing over and over...he sings about real situations....like is ""babymother"" OMG I LOVEEE that song...KEEP IT UP MUSIQ!!!!"
2,The few standout tracks on this album are...,"1) The intro, ""soulstar.""2) ""youloveme,"" which should have been the first single, not ""forthenight.""3) Somewhere between ""momentinlife"" and ""thereason.""Otherwise, a less than stellar album."
2,Don't Believe The Hype!,"I am a fan of Musiq - don't get me wrong. I really liked his first two albums, so I was thoroughly outraged when I bought/heard ""Soulstar"". Nowhere on the same level! It lacks so much of the ""soul"" that ironically labels it. Honestly, pick up ""Dwele - Subject"" or ""Kem - Kemistry"" instead. This album is not hot, don't believe the hype! And whoever said that Musiq in on the same level as Maxwell, must be deaf! At any rate, the best song on the entire album is ""forthenight"" (for the night), which they play so frequently on the radio. If you're curious, let one of your friends lend it to you (if they have it), or ask them to burn it for you... I wouldn't recommend blowing your hard-earned moolah on this soul-less atrocity. ;o("
2,Soulstar - - Not Quite There Yet!,"I got the feeling when I was listening to this album that he wasn't there musically or lyrically. The majority of this album is just passé and I could take it or leave it. Forthenight is the only song on here that gets major play in my cd player, and he couldn't even give you five minutes to really get into it. The other songs sound as if he was going off into left field. Now only if he could JustgivemeawholealbumIcouldlistentoo!"
2,Mr.Average,"and that is a reach.this Album has Easily His Best Music to date on it but the Cat can't Sing to Me&nothing every seems to change.now He is One Lucky Cat with all the Tribute Shows&Projects He gets to be down with.but as far as Being an Elite Artist?Don't Believe the Hype.thsi Album He is trying to tap into R.Kelly,D'angelo&Maxwell's World&Come up way short."
2,Whack,"What's good with this album. His first album was a classic and the second was good. This is just whack. His voice is not up to par like Glenn Lewis, Bilal, Maxwell and D'Angleo. Come on,are some of you people deaf? He can't carry a note."
4,Definitely feelin' it,"I have to disagree with all the naysayers of this album. I feel that Musiq was trying to reach out and experiment with some of these tracks. ""Momentinlife"" was a nice collaboration with Kindred and Cee-Lo, though I felt ""Dontstop"" really wasted the potential energy that could have been shared between Musiq's crooning and Bilal's ethereal falsetto. ""Forthenight"" seems like your classic loverman-get-them-out-the-club-and-into-the-bed type of song, but Musiq is so polite it seems only natural to go with him. Best track of all is ""Givemorelove/leaveamessage""(thanks to the sample from Tom Scott, which I did buy to hear the original). I'm only waiting for the next LP."
5,Musiq does it again!!!,"When I first bought this album, I wasn't sure how I felt about it, unlike my immediate love for the first two. But recently I had the pleasure of seeing Musiq in concert and he made me go and reevaluate/rediscover this classic that I had been sitting on since it first came out!! The entire album from beginning to end is very well put together. Out of the 15 tracks, 11 of them are my favorites. Musiq, keep doing what you do best!!"
4,Aijuswanalisen!!!,"Soulstar, Soulchild, whatever, just keep the Musiq COMING!!! Musiq is a talented, original artist. Not in an eclectic Erykah Badu kind of way, but more like a Curtis Mayfield. Shucks this CD is so good that the first time I listened to it in my car I stopped at the package store to get a pint of Hennessy.... It's old school brown liquor GOOD!!!! Like a good vintage wine, it keeps getting, better & better with each listen.... His creativity with the Monopoly game in ""Womanopoly"" is sick!! Fantasia can have her ""Baby Mama"" anthem, Musiq keeps it real with ""Babymother""! Aijuswanalisen!!!"
4,Great album but not as good as the first,"This album was recommended to me by several Musiq fans. And after having it in my cd player for the last 3 days I have to admit that it is a great cd. However compared to his first album it is not his best work. The topics chosen were not as deep as on the first cd and all the guest singers on ""Soulstar"" were not necessary. Other than that I would recommend this cd along w/ his first. If you bought it you wouldnt be dissapointed."
3,hmm . . . i dunno yet . . .,"This cd definitely had to grow on me. It was an x-mas gift, and I wasn't feelin' it like i did the first two cds. I still havent been able to listen to it from beginning to end in one sitting. I like most of the songs, but there are a lot that are skipable. If you dont have them already, just buy the first two and save your money on this one. ""Whoknows"" and the intro are two songs that really stood out to me. There are a couple others that I can't remember the names of, but nah...to me this is his most commercial cd. I was not and still am not feelin' ""forthenight"". The vocals, some of the lyrics, and most of the harmonies are really nice, and that's why I went as far as to give it a three. Hopefully Musiq will bring it up a notch on his next cd."
4,Musiq - 3rd album,"Pleasantly surprised. Having missed the hype (if there was any) on this album, I purchased it because I own the previous two. Out of the 6 CD's I purchased, it's of the top two. He's original, his lyrics are interesting, music to make you think and move at the same time. Love it."
4,"Good, but could be better","All of the people that gave Musiq 5 stars are just die-hard Musiq fans. Although I enjoyed this album, it definitely fails in comparison with his other albums. Musiq, who is usually very deep and profound with his lyrics and sends out a thought provoking messages doesn't quite do that this time. He definitely could have kept the single entitled babymother, I mean the title alone speaks for itself. I must say after being a gigantic fan of aijuswanaseing and juslisen, I must reluctantly admit that this one does not reach the bar that I know he can reach. Don't let this discourage you because this is a good album, just not as good as the others."
5,I am not surprised!!!,"I love this main. He is the Stevie of our time. His music remains soulful and is entrenched with meaning. I love the beats and lyrics. He continues to explore more of what soul music is, and can be.The intro is bangin'. I love #5 and #10 especially. I can honestly put all 3 albums in rotation and be entertained for hours. Cop this album!"
4,Jusbeautiful,"At first I didn't really care for this album, but after a couple of listens, I love it. Neo-soul is here to stay and Musiq is the greatest. My favorite tracks are Womanopoly, Babymother, Who Knows, and so on. This cd is hot and I can't wait for the next one."
5,A Five Star Album,"Musiq has put to together one solid project with his third effort Soulstar. The album is incredibly self assured and focused. It is rare that I enjoy a CD on first listen, but Soulstar is worthy of such recognition. In addition the use of guest stars such as Cee-lo and Kindred on Momentinlife and Carol Riddick on Soulstar do not seem forced, but a well throughout and executed idea. As I said in the review over a year ago for Juslisten, It took a while for it to grow on me. Soulstar grabbed me on first listen, and I plan to continue to hear what Musiq has to say."
2,F for effort,COME ON!!! I am a Musiq fan to the core. But we need more than just unclever words and same story scenarios. The only song worth listening to was the first one after the intro. I forced myself to listen to the rest. Womanopoly? Baby Mama Drama? What about love longs and decent ones at that. The second CD was a keeper. Musiq should practice his craft or lose a fan. Also...stop remaking original songs if you DO NOT have the voice for it.
2,"The second was better, the first was best","I was pretty disappointed with this CD, and don't think I'll be buying another Musiq CD because he seems to be going downhill. He's basically regurgitating the first two projects with not very much success. I really like Musiq's whole vibe, hopefully it's not too late for the brother to pick it back up again."
3,mixed reaction,"A memoir of a woman's attempt to understand the history and culture that shaped her El Salvadorian husband. She wants to make herself part of his early life and to be able to pass this culture on to their son. While she provides a good basic introduction to El Salvador, including history, the economy, and geology, her search for understanding seems half-hearted. As an engaging portrait of her life or of the people of El Salvador, it's disappointing. However, there is not a lot of information out there on this country, so those planning to travel there might find some of the descriptions interesting."
3,Does not work on XBOX 360.,"I bought this game used, expecting to play it on my XBOX 360. To my surprise when I inserted the game into my XBOX 360 I got a message saying this game needs and update to play on the 360 and check the Xbox website. Lesson learned. Always check the compatibility list on the XBOX website before buying an old game. It is not on the list of original XBOX games that will work on the 360. UBISoft seems to have abandoned the game for Xbox with the latest release being only in other formats. So unless you are still running a first generation XBOX avoid this game."
3,Not for XBox live subscribers,The game in itself is pretty good. The best part of the game is the tutorials. If you really want to learn how to play chess like a pro get this game. However if you are looking for a game that you can use on Xbox live DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. I went on Xbox live to play this game and no one else was playing. The Xbox population has not caught on to this game enough to spend money on it.
4,Classic Arcade Games,"These games play EXACTLY like the original versions I used to play in the old arcade days.Same graphics, sound effects, strategy, etc.Exact ports of the originals."
3,not compatable with xbox 360,was mad that it came up when i searched for pacman for xbox 360 so i thought it would work on the 360 but it was not compatable
2,Poor renditions of classic games,These versions do not play like the original games. I'm amazed that they don't just write an emulator so that they can get their games right!
3,Not exactly as pictured,This charm is pretty clips onto other charms well but it is not emerald green it's a bright grass green. I still like the charm but was disappointed it wasn't a dark emerald green
2,"Industrial, though not ""Professional""","I too bought this disc because Ray McVeigh is the guitarist. His playing on the Professionals ""I Didn't See It Coming"" record is incredible. The guitar tandem of Ray and Steve Jones (sex pistOls) on that record was, as far as I'm concerned, the punk equivalent of Keith Richards and Ron Wood. Tasteful, catchy, weaving guitar lines that are stuck in my head forever.There is none of that here. Like many industrial records, everything is so sludged in effects, you can't make out any style at all. There are also appearances by a few other artists I dig, but the same problem exists there.If you need another industrial record, this is better than Filter, or any of that nonsense, but it's nothing that's going to change your life."
3,hide overly influenced by the american members of the band,"Part of hide's charm was his free-wheeling venture into all different styles of rock music. Here, the american producers of the album seem to have targeted it to a particular industrial-explicit niche, losing a lot of the lightness, humor, and experimentation found in hide's other albums. The english lyrics to Doubt and Pose seem to be guitarist's McVeigh's setting of some standard western rock lyrics to the music and just don't sound right. The musicians are excellent and the mix great, but I don't find any of the songs particularly memorable."
3,Hide can't sing,"I bought this because I recently saw The Philistines and noticed that Ray McVeigh, an outstanding guitarist, had a Zilch sticker on his guitar. He produced and plays on this CD.The music is a 4, great sonic tracks with driving guitars and music that takes chances, although it frequently opts for riff-laden techno grooves. But the singing I'd have to rate as a 2-or less. I just don't see what the fuss is about with Hide's singing; I found it grating on every track, and his lyrics are puerile, almost always focused on sex. Gets a little old. If I could wipe the vocals track off this CD, I would. It would be a lot better."
4,A Well Made Exact Rendering of the Movie,"All the cute and not-so-cute characters are here: Lady, Tramp, the Darlings, Aunt Sara, Si, Am, Jock and Trusty, and they follow the story line of the movie exactly, which is O.K. But there's no ""Oh Wow"" factor with the pop-ups or pull tabs. This book made me realize that I loved this movie, not just for the story, but for the sweet voice of Lady and those wonderful lullabies. A very well made book that should last through many, many readings."
3,Padre of the Plains,I received this book on time and in good shape. The book has lots of stories that lead you to an interesting climax but the climax never comes.
5,Incredible,"A great movie, fast, moving, totally capturing. It makes you think, it makes you dance, it makes your heart beat faster, and most important of all it makes you realize how important ""a second"" of lifetime can be and how it can change everything."
4,"Sometimes, style over substance works.","I mean, it's bloody amazing--there is absolutely NOTHING to this film, yet it somehow manages to be utterly compelling. Almost the entire film consists of Lola, um, running. Indeed, the few less-frenetic scenes really do little more than get in the way. But for the most part it's pure action, and it works. And this from someone who, as a rule, finds action films insufferably tedious. The direction is indeed to be commended for so rarely letting up. The soundtrack's perfectly done also--and this from someone who, as a rule, violently dislikes industrial techno. I get the impression that if anything had been done even slightly wrong, the entire film would have fallen apart--but nothing IS, really. As I said, it really doesn't have a helluva lot of substance, but it sure is a rush to watch."
5,German ground hog day.,"A well done ground hog day type movie. A very well done movie, that keeps up the interest all the way through."
4,Great film,"I first saw this film in a film class in college and from that point on I knew I had to have it. It probably isn't one of the best films out there, but it is worth the watch. I'd go over more about the movie, but I'd end up giving to much away."
2,"Run Away, Run","Although ""Run, Lola, Run"" is off-beat, has some nice camera work and a few impressive images, I could not develop any interest in any of the characters. Lola's extreme red hair and goofy outfit (blue tank top, white bra straps, turquoise pants, and black Doc Martin boots of all things) were distracting. The ""driving music beat"" (or however it was described), was fairly boring and repetitive.The commentary was only slightly more interesting than the movie. The two participants of writer/director Tom and lead actress Franka were a couple at the time, which accounts for the mutual admiration society feel of the commentary.There may have been a good idea for a movie here, but I could not find it. Close to being the least watchable movie (""Lost and Delirious"", ""The Smokers"", ""Black and White"" and ""Armageddon""). I nearly dozed off both times.I give the movie two stars for effort and concept, but I advise you to...""Run Away, Run"""
5,BE SELFISH AND ANTISOCIAL.,"This film made my heart stop. I subconsciously held my breath in parts, for fear of disturbing its incredible movement and beauty. What an innovative succession of events! Just when you think it's over, Lola stuns you again. Watch this film ALONE. Pay attention. The first experience is key."
2,What a disappointment,"My 16 year old daughter told me this film changed her life. I'm getting her into therapy soon. I suppose that as a study in film making techniques and creativity this film breaks some novel ground. Aside from that the characters held no interest for me, a 47 year old. The overdone running scenes comprise about 50% of what is a rather short-running film to begin with. Decent Dolby 5.1 effects. Look for something else!"
2,i dont fully comprehend the fascination with this movie,"I dont see what the BFD was about this movie. I mean, yeah she looks cool and they do drugs, yay. I thought the experimental ""and then"" parts were kinda cool. But I just didnt like the movie. I dont think they connected the groundhog day feeling of it all together that well. Or obviously. This was better than the otherGroundhog Dayin how it was maybe an hour shorter. Not for me. And I usually like off beat movies. Just dont be off beat for the sake of being offbeat. I think I might check out the soundtrack though."
2,Monotonous and annoying,"If you like thumping, loud, monotonous music, you may like this film better than I did. With all the hungry, talented musicians in the world, I would think this film maker could have found one that could provide decent music.Although I liked Potente in other films, it was difficult for me to find the characters interesting. Maybe I could forgive Lola for being in love, but her boyfriend seemed worthless.Yes, this film showed various futures that could have arisen from a single starting point. That is a good idea for a film, but I just think, in spite of the attempts at originality, the result did not bear fruit. For a more intelligent film about the possibilities arising from a situation, I think Rashomon would be a better way to spend your time."
2,I cannot believe...,"I cannot believe that people would give this film 5 stars. I forced myself to watch the entire film just because I could not believe that someone would actually recommend this film. Yea it has an interesting twist, but it gets real painful after a while. If you love it, god bless..."
2,"Tried to like it, but bad music ruined it.","It was kind of an interesting film, but I found the music boring and monotonous. Some of you have good points about the technical merits and originality, but I just could not get past the music, so for me it was not enjoyable. If the director and producer both had tin ears, there are millions of cheap, underpaid musicians in the world. Or just leave some of the more obnoxious music out.Germany/Austria has given so much great music to the world: Mahler, Brahms, Schumann, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Handel, Bach, to name a few. It's a shame that this movie from Germany could not do better.The characters were difficult to identify with. Maybe that was intentional. It was difficult for me to understand why Lola cared about her worthless boyfriend.I have never rated a movie this low before, but there are some worse films than this. It would have been a decent movie if they had taken the care not to ruin it."
3,techno,I think that the music kept this movie moving. I see the picture as an accompaniment to the soundtrack. They enchanche each other. I see this movie as a reeeally long music video. Don't get the dubbed version get the one with the subtitles. Hear the actors voices even if you dont know what they are saying. THis is not to say that the movie does not have other virtues. It probably does.
2,Ich weiß ja nicht !,"Also ich finde es ja toll, dass ein deutscher Film in den USA so gut ankommt, aber ich habe ihn bei uns in Deutschland im Kino gesehen und dachte mir ""wie lange rennt die denn noch"" und ""warum rennt die schon wieder"". Mein Freundin fand den Film aber echt klasse. Von den vier Leuten die wir waren gibt einer 5 Sterne, 2 geben drei Sterne und ich gebe dem Film 2 Sterne. Würde ihn mir aber niemals auf DVD oder Video kaufen."
3,"Stylish, but derivative plot","Run Lola Run has achieved a sort of cult status since its arrival from Germany, and in its style alone, it's easy to see why: this is one fast-paced, breakneck-speed story, with a likeable, punk heroine (Franka Potente), very cool animation, and a good soundtrack. On all of those levels, Run Lola Run works well. However, the story is another matter. I've read several reviews praising the different nuances, stylistically and story-wise, which change as the story runs each time. What I found was a crime-story version of the film Groundhog Day, or a more stylish version of an X-Files episode from several years ago titled `Monday', in which Mulder experienced the same botched bank robbery several times. Run Lola Run definitely wins on its style points, but on those points alone."
4,"QUIRKY, ENERGETIC, BLAZING PULSE-POUNDER","To the beat of an incessant techno/deephouse soundtrack, Lola runs, and then runs some more. I couldn't possibly think of another movie with such sheer cinematic buzz, it's cut like an MTV video: blink and you may miss a visual gag.The theme is doozy but interesting -- a slicing of the same reality in time into three perspectives. Blending an innovative mix of animation, still photography, slow motion, and normal cinematography, it illustrates how the smallest change in what a person does can alter the rest of their life, not to mention the lives of others, including complete strangers they pass on the street.Ironic, creative, and simply riveting -- a fabulous kinetic pleasure of a rental. The breathless high-octane soundtrack should be in your dance collections too."
1,"Three words: empty, repetitive and boring","I know all opinions are subjective but I do not undertsand what you could find interesting in this movie. The love story is stereotyped. The boyfriend is an idiot (which makes the girl an even more idiot), the soundtrack is exhausting and the plot is non existing. In this type of movie there is MUCH better which has been done. Please....."
1,What a waste!,"""What a waste of money! "" These words demonstrate my exact reaction after watching this movie which I have regrettably purchased on DVD. Excited to have a new DVD player, I bought this DVD after reading the many great reviews about the movie. Now I'm extremely puzzled. Why so much praise for this flick? It is anything but interesting: the story is childish and shallow and the much talked about cinematography and the music are nothing more than cheap attempts to decorate the silly plot. For those of you who want to buy the movie, rent it first! If you are not a fad-driven kid who actually thinks MTV is a music television and Jewel a poet, then you'll surely dislike it. There are no philosophical ideas here. The mere fact that this movie is considered to be ""thought provoking"" may be a testament to the reality that perhaps we are not thinking much."
1,"Run Lola, Run Lola, run Lola and again run Lola",I did not get it. She is just running and running and again running. No philosophical idea. No point. The movie is telling us the same story in three different versions. Why? Boring...
1,she never stops running,"ok, so u want to know what a bad film is like. yea well dnt watch this one cause u will just fall asleep and still not know the film is about her running and runninga and running and running and u get the picture"
1,Run Money Run!,"This is one movie where the title makes as much sense as the content. I gave it one star, although Franka deserves five stars for fitness."
5,WOW,"The best film of 1999 in my opinion. It made me think, it held me spellbound, it leaped off the screen, and it was totally fresh. I was very disapointed when it was not nominated for best foreign film by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."
5,"If you haven't seen this movie yet, turn off the PC and go..",Run to your neighborhood rental house and rent it! What a wonderful contemporary film.
4,Unique,"Lola needs to get hold of 100,000 Deutschmarks because her boyfriend Manni left a bag of money on the subway (or light rail). If she doesn't get it in 20 minutes, he will rob the store near the phone booth where he called her. The money belongs to a gangster who will kill Manni if he doesn't get the cash.There are three different scenarios on Lola's mad dash to rescue her boyfriend. It shows how each encounter with people changed their lives.I liked it because it was different from any movie I've seen. It got a little too far out with the very brief moments she brushed by people. But the main parts of the story was good.Well, great idea for a script. Just needed a little tweaking."
2,Amelie on Acid,"This pic reminds me a bit of Amelie, but much better. Amelie was cutsie and this is an action pic. Unfortunately, the running does get a bit tiresome, though it is interesting for much of its running time."
5,Captivating!,"The only thing upon which I can agree with the previous viewer is that the character of Manni is indeed a bit annoying--not too bright, and all too willing to blame Lola for his own predicament. This film is so taught, however, that it hardly matters.Run Lola Run is imaginative, mesmerizing, and take-your-breath-away exciting. The amazing visuals work perfectly with an outstanding soundtrack and a highly engaging storyline to create a truly exquisite film experience. Highly, highly recommended!"
3,"Good, but extremely overhyped","I enjoyed this in the theater, but found it another in a series of what if we look at an event several different ways (""Rashomon""-style). Like Sliding Doors and Go, this film was fun. It wears thin by the end, though, along with the MTV-type editing techniques."
4,A fun ride and interesting filmmaking,"I saw this one Friday night and soon after bought the dvd. The other reviews give you a plot breakdown, but I will mention a few things I really like. Filmed in Germany(West Berlin) maybe, and lots of outdoor city locations. I have only viewed the sub-titled version, and it works great. A couple dialogue- heavy scenes which require some reading, but not too taxing. I do have a thing for most things German, so I like hearing the language. Also a fine soundtrack in this film! Techno and pulsing, watch this on a home theatre or with a high quality audio system. It really adds to the experience imho. Plus I enjoyed the little ""snapshot"" stills that Twyker throws in along the way. Very cool.Some negative reviewers say they didn't get the film and it was repetitive. Just go along for the ride and enjoy the sights and sound. In my opinion this is a real good way to spend an hour and a half. Try it out! Thanks for reading my sort of disjointed review."
5,Startlingly Unique,"""Run Lola Run"" is a masterpiece so unlike a movie - a movie in the traditional sense, that is, that it's difficult to follow at first. On second and later viewings, it can be viewed for the marvel that it is. It is ingenious in its subtle nuances of passing characters and seemingly throwaway moments that turn out to be so much more, and build the suspense and anticipation, as well as the opprtunity for brilliant twists, throughout the movie. The pulsating sound-track is a stroke of genius, and falls right in step with the relentless pacing of the movie. If you are intolerant of unusual or innovative filmmaking, do not see this movie. But if you have a genuine taste for the bizzare, the creative, the attention-grabbing, and the deviously intelligent, ""Run Lola Run"" is a movie for you."
5,Direct Hit,"This is the best action movie I've ever seen. I've never been a big fan of techno music before, but it is used so effectively in this movie that I found myself drawn to the soundtrack afterward. If you can appreciate cinematography like a fast-paced music video, you will absolutely love this film - guaranteed."
5,A good film...and an amazing work of art,"This film is one of the best films I have seen, in many ways, you can't describe it, but it is fast-paced and you will not be bored. The German language in the movie actually adds to the movie, it would not be so good if it was in English. This movie is so innovative. 5 stars from me."
4,Nice movie on Chance,"This movie could have ended after 30min. Instead it repeats the first 30 min 2 more times, but with different outcomes. It shows how the little things in life may affect the bigger picture and course of one's life. A bit philosophical of a movie, but it is fast paced. Lola does run a lot!"
4,Lola is a Super Hero,"Good movie. Well-paced. Great music. But try watching it as a cross between Groundhog's Day and X-Men. Seriously. Consider Lola as a super hero- time manipulation, sonic powers (a la Banshee), healing powers.Lola is a super hero."
2,"All style, no substance","There are so many good things in this movie that I really wish that I could've liked it more. But, as it is, it felt like the cinematic equivalent of a video game. If you really do want to spend 80 minutes watching some chick running then I'd suggest waiting for the next Olympics. For a German movie with some depth, rent anything by Fassbinder, Herzog or Wenders."
2,"""Different"" kind of movie!","I bought the dvd of this movie after I read all those positive feedback from other viewers. However, this is not the type of movie that I'll be willing to wait for more than a month for viewing. As an overseas buyer,the movie, shipment waiting time, and the cost of buying it all doesn't meet my high expectation/anticipation level of the movie. I was expecting something more like ""Le femme Nikita"" not a story of 2 youngsters having three different ending of their problems. The only good thing from this movie, for me, is the music! Two thumbs up for the music selection..."
4,Entertaining to say the least,"I liked it. I won't be overly snobish like many of the reviewers, so I will just say this: This is a very entertaining movie with an OK plot and gret music. There, I won't get into the psuedo intelligence like the other reviews."
3,an unordinary movie with a pumping soundtrack,"""Lola rennt"" is the original title. And in Germany the movie was the hit of the year. But the film has some unreal scenes, for example when lola runs around a corner, she returnes in a street which is 7 km from that corner. But I like that movie because of some great scenes and the brilliant soundtrack that makes lola run even faster."
3,short but sweet,"no really. It's just over an hour long. It's all been said. RLR is fast, creative and interesting. I'm glad it was short though. Had it been any longer I probably would have gotten bored. Wise choice."
5,My Favorite Foreign Film,"I usually don't like foreign films but this one is great! This is a fast paced, high energy film. Interesting plot and 3 surprise endings. (Side note:It's nice to see Germany from a everyday person's perspective and not a travel brochure.)"
5,Classic cult flim,"It was good. It is good. and the next I watch it, it will still be good. It's a what if i can go back a hour or two and change events before time run out."
5,The most fascinating movie I have seen in years,"The people here have already summed it up quite well, but I must chime in anyhow. I went to see this movie in the theater twice (the FIRST time I have EVER done so with ANY MOVIE). Needles to say I loved it and am awaiting the dvd release.BUY THIS MOVIE YOU WILL LOVE TO WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.Don't let the German language version scare you the subtitles are easy to read and it makes you feel as if you are running through Berlin yourself!!!!!!!"
3,Brilliant Gem!!!,"This movie is purely amazing! The plot is wonderful, that acting is superb and the soundtrack is fantastic! Not only that, but the film used is perfect and the mix of blak and white and also film was wicked!! i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants real intensity and really good acting to the point where it seems like your in the movie! Prepare to be blown away!!!!"
5,Postmodern Kieslowski,"Very inventive movie and reminds me of Kieslowski, without the Catholic baggage, in that we see how randmom life isand how small encounters and slight changes in timing can significantly alter one's life and others (without our even being aware of it).This is an interesting ( but not new ) idea to think about, yet it is cleverly presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner in this film. This movie has all the elements of a classic cult film."
5,SEHR GUT,"I really liked this movie. Visually, it is a very beautiful movie. The characters, even the minor ones, are intriguing. The plot is exciting and revolutionary. And finally, the soundtrack is wicked awesome.Franka Potente is an amazing actress,there is more evidence of this in the Bourne Identity. She has lots of charisma and pulls you into the movie. Manni actually wasn't too bad. He and Lola are both pretty weird people so its ok.Applause to the Germans, you've come up with a really good one here! Sehr gut!"
5,"A cross between ""Sliding Doors"" and ""Pulp Fiction""","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It was so fast-paced and interesting. Oh my god, you absolutely have to see it!!!"
5,Brilliant,"This is a brilliant film. Lola the played by Franke Potente is a Red Haired (not natural if you know what I mean)freaky type who gets a call from her boyfriend Manny who is frantic telling her he lost a bag of money that he was taking to Renni a bald headed cimminal type. He states he has 20 minutes to get the money to Renni or he is a dead man. Lola tells him to stay where he is and she rushes out of her home to find $100,000 or is it in Deustch Marks? Anyway this is a very clever story that takes place in real time. So you may be thinking if the movie takes place in real time does it only last for 20 minutes? HMMM, you will have to see the film. The highest recommendation. I would watch it w/o subtitles first then watch it with subtitles. German film 5 plus stars No need to watch it before you buy it. It is easily worth the money"
5,An exhilirating ride!,"Run Lola Run would have to be one of my all time favourite movies. It is one of the most innovative, and original movies I have ever come across. I could never really tolerate euro-techno until I rented this DVD. The music was composed by talented director/writer Tom Tywker and performed by his leading lady (on- and off screen) Franka Potente, who is brilliant and charismatic as Lola. The story is simple: Lola has 20 minutes tomake up for the loot lost by his hapless boyfriend Manni or Manni will be killed. There are three alternatives to the story, each detailing how one's actions could have consequences on others who cross their path. Many have compared this to other what-if flicks such as ""Sliding Doors"". But this film benefits from not having a terribly self-conscious Gwyneth Paltrow having another bad attempt at a British accent.The movie is fast, euroccentric, and you wouldn't believe that you'd been staring at the screen for 90-minutes. More exciting than a soccer match."
1,One word: TRIPE,"I see a lot of glowing reviews for this movie and I just don't get it. It's not ""deep"", ingenious, brilliant, or anything else that I've heard it called. Anyone who thinks this movie is thought provoking probably thinks Barney the dinosaur is a great philospher (seriously, get an education). This is a gimmicky, kitchy film that is a combination of concepts that have all been used before. The funny part is that they weren't great concepts the first time I saw them in other films. But hey, nothing suceeds like excess...so lets bring it all together and make a really really bad movie!"
1,HORRIBLE,"This movie doesn't even deserve one star. The script was horribly written, and they kept on playing the SAME thing over and over and over again. Little parts changed while they replayed it, but I knew I couldn't stand to watch ANOTHER rerun again. I had to watch this movie for German and I'm certainly not watching it again."
4,Latter Day' Groundhogs Day,"I believe the movie does well because of the premise of the Movie.The premise in this point is the background ie* the music, the Running & the fates that that lie in the endings.......That being said I have not seen this movie since it was in the theaters, so I may be ambiguous & therefore this may not be the best review & I will be open to critiques.I like this movie & reccomend it to anyone who is in the mood for something different...."
3,I have heard about alternate endings but only in extra features.,"This movie is overrated by people who might have found the movie's concept really really cool. I think this movie doesn't provide much beside its original....(daring)screenplay. Sure, it is nice to watch Lola running through out the movie but I had higher expectations. I am glad that the director was looking for a happy/perfect ending otherwise Lola would be running for eternity."
3,Interesting premise,"This movie explores the variations that affect our day. Most of the time, small changes wouldn't mean much. But, when life is on the line, one small change can have a profound impact on the following decisions, events, and coincidents. This movie is brave enough to show them, taking a page from Rashomon, which shows the same events from 3 different perspectives.However, where this movie lost me was caring for the characters. The boyfriend whose life is on the line is a gangster, a drug dealer. Why would I care if he lives or dies? So he can poison the youth later on?Overall, the DVD is average. There's not many extras, but it is a 2-sided DVD that has both widescreen and full-screen versions (for those of you that like to miss 40% of the movie). This movie may worth a watch, not much more."
1,"""I don't get it"" ""Nothing thought provoking"" ""Nothing Philosophical""","I give this film 5 stars. This and The Princess and the Warrior are in my top 10 all time favorites.This is less a review than advice to those that may be influenced by the 1 star reviews. The reviewers all tried really hard to sound intelligent while at the same time admitting that they ""don't get it"" and claim that there was nothing thought provoking.They say that it was just the same thing three times showing three possible results. These reviewers said it themselves- they didn't get it.During the movie the song What a Difference a Day Makes is played both to create atmosphere and to send a message. One of the main points of the movie is to show what a difference precious seconds can make..Cheers.P.S.Hopefully this sheds some light for the 1 star reviewers as well, but I doubt it."
4,only people w/ brains need to buy,"only people who actually think throughout the course of the day need to buy this movie. it's fantastic, but it won't do much for drones and zombies who live most of their lives without ever developing any insight on anything. It's interesting and entertaining at the same time, and it leaves you to consider how time plays such a big role in our lives and our encounters w/ people. If you don't buy it you should rent it b/c it will get you to thinking."
5,Great Film,"I borrowed this movie from my friend to kill some time at work and though he had explain the plot; I still loved it! What he told me didn't exactly tell me what to expect. Espeically how well the music is cordniated with the film. The speical features include a great video; which is of the lead actress's song. The other features didn't interest me so I didn't check them out. If you liked the books that you can choose the outcome like go to page 8 or 16 you'll love this movie. I intially watched it in English Dub audio but the lips were totally off and the voices sounded so weird, so I watched in German with English subtitles. I didn't mind the subtitles. I do enjoy forgein films, so if you like them too, buying this DVD would be a great addition."
4,A Running Movie,"Although it is in german when you have the DVD you can change languages to english. The base of the story is Lola's boyfriend must get a whole lot of money in 20 minutes. HOW??? well thats the whole plot.It starts out with this wild cartoon and then turns into the ""real life"" which it is the most of the movie. The movie is a non-stop whirl-win of fun. The excitment and action (not explosives) is great.I own this movie and although i dont watch it all the time I do find myself going back and watching it whenever i want to see a good action/excitement movie. It has a good plot and the way the movie was put together is new and vibrant. The music supports the film very well also.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to talk about doing stuff but doesnt because then you can dream you are Lola on this journey but you never really would be!"
5,A Perfect Film,"I dont think I can actually say enough about this movie to tell you how fantastic and perfectly grand it was to watch. I think having over 50 customer reviews with an average 5 star rating says it all! I bought the movie just off the basis of my friends reviews, and now the movie is on my top ten list of the best movies I have seen. The cinematography, the plot, the music, the actors....all were excellent. I couldn't find a single flaw or even a ""they should have done this..."" This one is just too good to miss."
1,This single is bad,"Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Deeper Underground (Chillington Mix) tries to have a more darker sort of industrial sound which sounds pretty mushy and terrible, as the vocals do not fit in one bit with the music.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
1,IS NOT CAPABLE WITH WINDOWS XP.,"You probably read towards the bottom of the description that it works with XP, and you'll even read it on the BACK OF THE PACKAGE, but it's not true. compaq still has no drivers for XP to recognize the PA-2, so if you have XP you'd better get a different mp3 player."
3,The good and the bad,The iPaq PA-2 is a reliable player if you use Windows Media Player. It then downloads in the wma format. MP3 format does not work. This is a fact (you can read about it on the Compaq web site). In wma format the music plays well. Downloads are slow and software is not self explanitory. Otherwise a good product. Not recommended if you are in a hurry to download your music. I suggest buying a few 64K flash cards.
5,Nice mp3,For me the PA-2 is great. i dont have any problems with it and it was for a reasonable price. There was one problem but that was due 2 my stupidity. So i just wanna let everyone no to get this product if youre lookin for a mp3 player!!
3,Instructional CD - Talk Now! Learn Tagalog,"Teaches a working vocabulary. Games provided are based on repeating the words so it does imprint the words. However, they do not provide any basics as to how to put words together to create sentences. It's still OK though as it does claim to be appropriate for ""absolute beginners""."
2,"Camera, yes - Camcorder, no","It works in my Sony DSC-S85 camera, but not in my Sony camcorder. It gives a format error. I'm not sure why the difference because it works fine in the camera. If I would have known that it would work only in the camera, I would have purchased the Sony Stick."
2,More info needed,"There are some many memory cards in the market, that I think the list of the camera brands and models should be available with the product description so it will be easier to find the more convenient for the one we are looking for, or when asking for products all of the choices for a specific brand of cameras will be presented in the results.R Limon"
5,SanDisk 128MB Memory Stick,"I purchased this product as a generic alternative to the more expensive Sony original. The two memory sticks are so similar that they may as well have been from the same manufacturer - I can detect absolutely no difference in performance between the two.The Sony memory stick format is useful but somewhat overpriced, so it is a real pleasure to find such a reasonable alternative. Strongly recommended"
2,not enlightened,"I was looking for a book that was a little more enlightened and a little less materialistic. This author clearly likes to shop (I am not a shopper), so it was hard to relate. Most of the ideas I have read before. I think the title is a little misleading. When I think about meaning, I think of higher ideals -- not just having more time to read a book in a quiet corner of my house. I don't know...I think if you have a strong sense of what brings meaning, you might find this book a bit superficial. Writing is good and there are good quotes too."
3,Good Book For Beginners,"I found the book to be quite helpful, however, there were some details he missed. Also, one concern I had was the overwhelming push toward Vanguard. I appreciate his enthusiasm for Vanguard, but when I contacted Vanguard to setup an account, their customer service was so delayed, unresponsive and disinterested that I chose not to do business with them. I found that a shock considering how much Tyson raves about Vanguard."
5,The one to start on!,"The basic text of the most exciting playwright of recent decades. The place to start when discovering the American drama as reader, actor, or teacher!"
5,Great purchase,"The book arrived on time and in good condition. This is an excellent collection for both theatre enthusiasts, teachers and for a comprehensive sampling of what Shepard is so gifted at constructing."
5,The best and most essential Shepard collection,"This collection features his finest and most mature work (Buried Child, Curse, True West) plus the best of his earlier plays (La Turista, The Tooth of Crime). They all showcase his great humor and startling use of language and imagery. Th more mature works deal, unflinchingly with american families. Tongues and Savage Love, which he did in collaboration with Joseph Chaiken, are wonderful, poetic meditations of existence and identity. If you are interested in Shepard as a playwright this is the finest collection of his best work. After this, I recommend seeking out the plays Fool for Love and A Lie of the Mind, for more of his ""mature"" work and then also Angel City as another prime example of the imaginative flights he took with his earlier work. In case you don't already know, Shepard is one of the most important American playwrights. Period."
5,A great afternoon!,"Loved this book. I'm a newbie to golf, and this book was full of charm. It's not going to really teach you how to golf, but it will teach you to appreciate the intricacies of the game, and a great personality in it.Plus, it will inspire you to practice, because Hogan was a true student of the game. And that never hurts."
2,Boring to Read,Everytime I think of this book I feel to yawn. I was excited to get it but I have to admit I was very bored reading it. The secret of Mr. Hogan's swing was no secret at all. It may have been back then but not now. My apologies to the author. It is just my opinion.
4,The Glass House People,"This book was a good book. It kept me want to read on and on. The only reason I gave it **** is because I got kind of confused during the middle of it. Here's my summary on the book:A teenage girl named Beth has to go with her mom and brother to stay with her mom's family. She has to leave behind her boyfriend, Ray, with whom she works at a stained glass store. Her mom ran away from home when she was 17 and hadn't been back since then. When they get to the house, Beth meets her crazy, drunk aunt named Iris. Iris severly dislikes Beth's mom, who's name is Hannah. Beth is not really sure why. In this book, Beth finds out what truly happened the night before Hannah ran away and why she did.This book leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat waiting to see what comes next!! Enjoy!!"
1,no blow,I bought this because 2 other 12 volt ocilating fans I've had did not ocilate. This one seems to reliably ocilate but even though it spins the blade it does not seem to move the air. jUNK DON'T BUY
4,The ESPN broadcast.,Great game... poor price for an ESPN broadcast. None the less a great championship game!
3,Good but could have been better.,"Having seen the 2007 Division 1 Mens Ice Hockey Championships in person there was little chance a DVD would ever duplicate the awsome experience I had. However as I forgot to tape it on my VCR I was happy to find a DVD of the game on Amazon. When I played the DVD with a friend who attended the game with me, we both felt a little dissapointed in the editing. Yes, all the action was there, but no pregame or between period segements that ESPN had were not there. The post game celebration which I enjoy the most was not there either. It took the feel or atmosphere that the game had. At least I experienced it in person, but its the little things that NCAA On Demand did not include that keep this from getting 5 stars. And to be fair maybe ESPN dosen't let them include more, but it will be the last product produced by NCAA On Demand that I will order. That being said, I am still glad to have the DVD to relive the fantastic third period finish."
1,THIS ITEM DESCRIPTION IS VERY MISLEADING !!!!,"This calendar begins with August 2005 and ends with July 2006! My son bought this for me for Christmas and was very dissapointed when I opened it and found out it was 'halfway used up' already. He felt very cheated and I felt very sorry for him. I think it is absolutely terrible that the item is not described truthfully. Shame, shame, shame on you! I wish I could give this item a negative number of stars!!!"
1,waste of money,"This book is a complete waste of money. It contains no information that a reasonably intelligent man (or woman) couldn't easily figure out on his or her own, or discover on internet dating sites for free. The authors are believers in astrology, and devote a substantial chunk of the book to providing astrological information. As you can probably tell, I do not believe in astrology, but despite that, the astrological information in the book would also be very quickly available at no cost to any minimally proficient Google user."
5,Great Advice for Guys,"These guys make a great case for finding Miss Right or Miss Right Now on the Internet. There's lots of common-sense advice that literally saved me hundreds of hours in wasted time and thousands of dollars in wasted dating money. The ""Women of Internet Dating"" section had some very funny stereotypes and I even learned something from their astrology section. Following their advice helped me find my future wife in less than 30 days! This little book is worth it's weight in gold."
1,"AWFUL, the Worst, cut and paste crap...with horoscopes?","This brief 100 pages book wastes 25 pages on horoscopes, zodiac signs, what your sign says about you, what signs mean in women, what signs you should date. What do ancient superstitions have to do with the Internet and why does it consume 1/4 of the book? The remainder of the book dispenses fairly obvious advice like woman types: ""some women are after money"" and ""if you marry a women with children, you will be a step father"" duh! Also a chapter on how to date when you are already Married, nice. This book mentions NOTHING AT ALL about the Internet. They just slapped Internet on the title to peddle an existing book on dating, except that it is useless as a general dating book as well! I got this at the library so I didn't pay for it, but I still feel like I was CHEATED, out of the hour of my life I wasted reading this garbage. The worst, avoid at all costs, even for free at the library. Horoscopes! Gawd."
1,Not reader worthy,"I bought this to review it for content and usability, I can't believer what I read. This book has nothing useful in it! It don't tell you anything about what to say or even how to figure out what type of woman you want let alone how to get her to respond to you. It's just full of useless information like horoscopes I culdn't believe it, it even had the chinese horoscope taken off of some menu in a restaurant! This book doesn't do anything buy take your money and waste a tree."
1,Just another excuse to make money,"I am sorry but after reading this book, I have to admit that the feminists are right. Men are pigs and the only reason this book was written was for the authors to make money.The book tries to justify its existance by saying it is designed to help you find the love of your life on the internet. It actually only helps you find the love of your night. If I had actually used any of the tips in the book, I would have had alot of sex but I doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible. In fact I doubt anyone using this tips would find their ultimate mate, it would be inspite of the tips not because of them.An entire chapter is devoted to sterotyping women, though the authors do try to explain most women do not meet these types, then the list over 10 to watch out for.I am glad I did not actually pay for this, I would have demanded my money back."
5,"In French or English, she's Queen Celine","If you think Celine Dion is fabulous in English, you should hear her in French. Her sound is much more original, less commericial. 1F4T is a fantastic album. It has an organic, rock sound. You don't need to know french to love this album or any of her last few french albums (d'eux, s'il suffaist d'aimer, chante plamodon). I don't know any french and i'm not some obsessed fan. but i love the french albums anyway because they are the best of an incredible artist whose english output can be quite bland and uninspired sometimes.The track listing:tout l'or des hommesapprends-moile vol d'un angene bouge pastu nagesje t'aime encore (english version with french title is on ""One Heart"")retiens-moije lui diraimon hommerien n'est vraiment finicontre naturedes milliers de baisersplus the bonus ""ghost track"" not listed anywhere on the cd:valse adieu"
5,Celines hit,Celine dion is magnificent on this album. Even though its french she's still great. She hits very high notes. Its Just an amazing album. Its very great. It Deserves a grammy award. Its Fantastic you should really bye it.
5,10 stars!,"This album is brilliant! If you buy it, I guarantee it'll be the best album you buy all year!"
5,"""1 fille & 4 types"" est superb!","Without a doubt listening, enjoying and understanding the passion that Celine pours into each one of her songs is one of the great prizes of speaking French. There are no power-ballads and not so many high notes in this album as it is a more intimate and personal. I love it, this is the perfect mixture of pop, rock and country like rythms. I love it, from ""Tout l'or des hommes"", to ""Le vol d'un ange"", ""Je lui dirai"" to her superb performance of ""Je t'aime encore"", every song is unique and wonderful. Well produced, mixed and arranged, no wonder it was an instant hit in Quebec and France!"
4,Great French Album!!!,"This is one of Celine's best albums. I was somewhat disappointed in her One Heart album, but she made amends with this one. I love Celine's voice and own almost all of her English albums and now 5 of her French albums. I only gave it 4 out of 5, because 2 of the songs lose me in the style of presentation. But other than that - grade A."
2,Disappointing,"This was a very disappointing purchase. The 'Premium Hand Decorated Exotic Wooden Tea Chest' appears to be pine decorated with printed paper. Although the print is very nice, the description of it is a bit overblown.The tea inside was okay. Some of the combinations of flavors just didn't go well together, and often drowned the flavor of the tea."
2,Questionable quality,"The teas are good, don't get me wrong, but the whole reason I purchased this for my wife was because of the box. And the quality of the box is mediocre at best. The corners were worn and the gold trim paint was splattered all over the top of the thing. Yikes!"
2,False advertising,"""Hand decorated""...? Only if that phrase means cheap glued-on paper. I, too, purchased this item primarily for the chest. The chest arrived with the paper already peeling from all corners; on the lid are several raggedy-edged holes in full view. Really disappointing. Does anyone from Bentley actually read the advertising copy?"
4,Nice Gift,The tea chest itself is quite pretty. I bought several to give as gifts. There's a nice variety of tea inside and some really good flavors of green tea.The one downside of the chest? That the company pastes a label on the bottom of the chest and it is NOT easily removed. The label covers the entire bottom of the chest. It would be nice if they at least made it so you can remove it without leaving the wood looking worse for wear. I realize a label isn't a big deal; I just prefer to give a gift without the unsightly label.
2,Good tea/cheap chest,"The tea assortment in the chest is excellent, vey tasty. However, the chest is very poorly put together. The applique material does not line up and there are numerous rough edges. Not wht I would want to display on the countertop."
3,Just confirming the review already here.,"Indeed, the tea is okay, the box is a joke. The full price is outrageous for this low quality clumsily decorated cardboard. Consider buying only for the price of tea, say for $15."
5,Great tea in a really nice presentation.,"Bentleys has some of the best teas out there. This box makes a great gift for tea lovers. It has a great variety of green teas (papaya, pomegranate, blueberry, etc.) and each comes individually bagged for freshness. Just steep and enjoy!"
2,Product is fair quality and has poor description,"I purchased the Dorman plug boot adapter and find them average in quality. I was looking to buy a ""SET"" of 4 for my 4 cyl Alero and was worried the picture shows only 2 boots but the price made me think it was for 4. the description never says it's for 2 but it's my fault for assuming there would be a complete set. Not real sure why anyone would buy only 2 when it makes for since to buy all 4 when servicing your auto. My bad I guess. Look around, for the price of these 2 boots (around 13 bucks when I bought them) you should be able to buy a complete set."
4,goods,"standard qualityI'm currently using in my car, I have little time to use, but arrived safely, and are two for the right price. I generally look good"
5,Memories of Cab 804 and much more,"Taxi is an outstanding sitcom and having Bob James score the music is like finding 500 bucks in the back seat of the Sunshine Cab they call ""old whip and chill"" (no power steering, no heater)--just the best! Bob's music sets the mood and elicits emotions for all the scenes. And, ""Angela's Theme,"" the theme of the show, is like getting a 100 buck tip on a 5 buck fare-amazing! So, if you want to know more, just ""gimme a buck,"" and you'll find out! And meet me at Jim's Mario's for a beer. Or we can go to the Tidepool, where after having several ""monsoons,' we'll be three sheets to the wind."
1,Gossip Girl Season 3...,What happened to the gossip girl that I came to know & love? Guess thats gone for good now. Season 3 of this show took a major dive. It's not the same as it used to be & prob will never be again. Unless if they come up with something drastic next season to put this show back in the game. It's really ashame this was a great show with amazing potential. Now it's just a bunch of college kids that whine because they don't want to grow up & are stuck in their hs days. Gossip girl needs a major makeover if it's gonna last because this show is going downhill fast!
1,Did not get whole season,Ordered this on Amazon and sent me 2 (CD #3) and no (cd #4)My daughter's Christmans present turned out to be terrible. Make sure you check your cd's if you order these. They don't send you the whole season but want whole season $$$$. Bought it from Sold by: Amazon.com LLC. Of course I can't return it either.....
4,Good Stuff,The item was exactly what I ordered and the person who received it as a gift loved it. I'm happy!
5,Gossip Girl: The complete Third Season,I purchased this item for my grandaughter to update her collection. She was well pleased with the gift which gave her many ours of relaxing enjoyment.
1,Scratched disk,"Disk 4 was scratched and so I couldn't watch 2 episodes, I tried cleaning the disk but that didn't work. All episodes were on the disks but there was also a disk 6 that had episodes from a different season, so I believe that these are fake."
3,not as good as the other series,the first one will always remian my fave. This is what it is. It's gossip girl but its not as good as the other seasons...
1,Gossip Girl Boring,"I dont get it,this is yet another show of wasted film.What is going on, rich kids, blah.INSTANT STAR on CTV Programming is not.Check INSTANT STAR out on the youtube.If you dont know about INSTANT STAR or Tommy & Jude maybe you should."
5,Gossip Girl Season 2,I think this is a great series. One can watch it and not really have to think too much - I find it very relaxing.
2,The promos for these episodes are a lot better than the actual show.,"Gossip Girl - The Complete First Seasonis the perfect example of a great show to watch. It was guy friendly too. After January 2009, when the show was heading in to the second half of theGossip Girl: The Complete Second Season, the storylines were rushed and repetitive and this pattern has continued in to the third season. Aside from the last disc, the entire season is a waste of money but the cover art does look tempting to buy. Let's face it, even Blake Liveley would like to leave the show. Seriously, how many times can Chuck and Blair get back together or a better question would be why s Michelle Tratchenberg returning at the end of every season?"
3,Bootleg Copy,"I purchased this DVD set a year ago, I was disappointed to see that it was a bootleg copy when I wanted to rewatch the season. The container it came in was broken and DVDs do not sit in place, but I let it slide because I thought that was due to shipping. However, the pictures on the DVDs and container had poor quality pictures on them. I wish I paid more attention to this when I first opened the package."
5,i love CHUCK AND BLAIR!!!,"Season 3 was mostly about chuck and blair in a relationship and while i ADORE those two, I kept waiting for the next episode where there will be some HOT chuck and blair sex like in season 1 and 2 but alas, it NEVER happened! this royally PISSED me off but like the title of this review implies, I love chuck and blair and they are the ONLY reason I watch gossip girl. there were a lot of sweet moments and that was why i bought the dvd, also there were some slightly hot scenes between chuck and blair that were in deleted scenes. I LOVE CHUCK AND BLAIR FOREVER, NOW AND ALWAYS!!!!!!"
1,Very disappointed,I am serving the military overseas ai expect delays over stateside deliveries. In this case the product did not arrive and I have contacted the seller through e-mail twice to let them know that the product never arrived. I have never heard back from the seller. Very frustrated.
1,UNDELIVERY,"I've already complained twice because I've bought this product on august 9th, 2010 and I've never received it. As I've never got a answer, I'm writting this comment. WhAT shoud I do? I'm waiting for so many months and no answer and no product"
2,Not Good Enough,I did not find this book particularly useful. The college descriptions are more like advertorials written by the colleges themselves rathen than objective and independent analysis with pros and cons. Furthermore the book provides little help with putting together an application for each of these schools - something the author could have done given his claim to know these institutions so well.
1,The title disproves its claim,"I graduated from one of the schools described in this book, and I was horrified to see it listed on the cover. Throughout my time there, I was surrounded by people who couldn't care less about the name on their diploma, and couldn't care more about the quality of their education. Anyone who would be interested in a book titled ""Hidden Ivies"" does not have the sort of personality suited to my school - the name is nothing, the labels are nothing. The professors and fellow students are everything. These are excellent schools, but they should be considered in spite of what the Greenes title them, not because of it."
5,West Point,"For those who want more than the Ivies ---- not only an Ivy-rated undergraduate education, but, virtue, leadership training, personal challenge, proving what you're made of, pride in giving something back to your family and America ---- the answer is West Point. EVERYONE has a good chance at the full scholarship. If this sounds like you, go for it.Recommended reading: ""West Point: Character Leadership Education..."", Norman Thomas Remick."
1,Not Worth the Trouble,"You just want to use your computer as a digital VCR right? It's unlikely you'll be doing so anytime soon with this video card. The TV feature wouldn't work until I uninstalled my NIC and USB. TV and DVD work fine now, but the capture (record) feature doesn't record any audio. Yes, yours may be ok, but here's one more thing: the software that comes with this card is version 7.5, but the current version is 8.5. Owners of the 7500 have to PAY $$$ for this upgrade, whereas owners of higher-end ATI cards get it for free. You want to do business with a company like this, be my guest."
4,An excellent card -- a flaky chipset...,"I had this card for about 2 weeks and the video performance was great. It has good Linux support from the gatos project and works for out of the box installs of Red Hat 7.3 and SUSE 8.0.Unfortunately, because of a bug in the i2c chipset the tv-input in the 7500 model doesn't work reliably. I would recommend the ATI 8500DV instead (also available from Amazon for not that much more)."
2,Tuner doesn't work well after 1 yr.,I purchased aiw 7500 aprox. 1yr. ago. I thought it was a decent card when I bought it at that point would have given it a 4star rating. Within three months the card started freezing my machine while using DVR. Then more reciently the video with the tuner started flashing bright than dark. It happens all the time making the tuner unusable. I have found no resolution to my problems from ati. I'm not angry just unsatisfied.
1,This card is terrible,"I bought this card for a new custom built system and problems from the start. This card caused my computer to crash so often that I had to save games every 5 minutes to make any progress. I wrote an email to ATI and received an automated reply advising me to update the driver. After downloading 5 files and spending over an hour with DSL I updated the drivers. Still the system crashed all the time. Finally the card totally failed with a boot to black screen and I sent it back to ATI for repairs. I purchased a PNY Geoforce Ti 420 to keep my computer going and suddenly NO CRASHING, NONE! It was so wonderful. I dug up the games that were too frustrating because of the crashes and they were perfect. ATI sent the card back and said that they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Well I can't find anything right with it."
4,Solid Album,"This album is for you if you enjoy violins, and long ambient pieces. Worth a purchase if you're into that kind of thing."
5,"Cheap, works.","Need memory, want it cheap? Why buy Sony and pay more? Save some money and get this one, works just like any other."
5,"Great companion to ""Rites of Passage""","It makes no sense to purchase this workbook without ""Rites of Passage"", the companion job search book by John Lucht. If you purchase this workbook on its own to try and save money, you'll find youself going back to order Rites of Passage anyway.This workbook is extremely useful at helping you put structure around following the advice dispensed in ""Rites"". It forces you to put down your thoughts using a logical and organized approach. This leads you to constructing a far superior resume and cover letter than you would have done otherwise.A very valuable tool for someone seeking a new job in the $100K+ range."
4,"When you need orgainzation, this really helps","The Executive Job-Changing Workbook by John Lucht is a Companion to Rites of Passage. It has numerous forms that are very useful in organizing a job search. It is clear, easily usable, and helps one control the organization of a varied job search. It is very cleaverly designed to take apart so that you can take one section in a briefcase on interviews. This helps recording and tracking search letters, phone calls, interviews, and thank you letters. A great help in a time consuming process."
1,Do NOT buy this burner!,"I ended up w/ this burner as a warranty replacement for my first VeloCD, which went toes up after about a month. Less than a year later, I have a completely useless burner that stalls at 6% and then freezes my entire system. After NUMEROUS emails and phone calls to TDK, I finally got ""authorization"" to send it in for replacement. I am so fed up, I am going to buy a Lite-On and wash my hands of it.Look elsewhere....this burner is not work the carboard box it is packaged in."
2,Save your money,"If you want a game for the whole family to enjoy, get Shrek.Just because the cartoons may be good, doesn't mean the game is.My 6 year-old doesn't like it."
1,How to raise the stress level in your house?-Buy Party Blast,"This game is a piece of .... The system requirements on the box are misleading. It is tough to explain to a six year old that his brand new game can't be played until you upgrade your video card, even though no reference was made to it on the box.And when the game finally works it looks like a hybrid of 2000 technology meets 1977 graphics."
2,Pretty bad,"This game is only for kids and if you play the game for a while you will get bored unless you are usually the age of 8 or under. The game is cute. I'm not looking for cute games. I mean shooting water, getting slimed, and doing a food fight is for kids. When you buy it, you will only like the games for probably like the game for 3 days unless you are a big Nickelodeon freak."
4,This game is fun and easy,"This game is fun and easy!! If you played Mario Party 4 for Gamecube and loved it, you'll like this game too. There are alot of short and easy mini-games to play in it. So, it may be too easy for kids older than 7. I love the basketball and the squirting mini-games the most. I've only had the game for a week now but I play it every day when I get home from school."
2,Not what I expected,I was excited when I first saw this game. We are always looking for a game for our young children to play. There it just not enough games for young children on x-box. This game was a big disappointment! There did not seem to be much of a goal to shoot for while playing. There are so many players on the screen at once that it is difficult to fine your player. It just was NOT FUN!
1,"Horrible game! Hard to understand and follow, bad graphics",We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games. This is the worst game we have ever purchased. It is hard to figure out...hard to play...and hard to see what you are doing. It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also...many levels that my daughter would want to play are 'locked' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it.
2,Not what I expected.,Not what I expected. Too much acting. Disappointing to say the least. I will not buy the like again. Oh well.
2,Please don't buy this globe.,E of Egypt is at one end and gypt at the other. Karachi is spelled Karacho. Portion of the Antartica is completely missing. Chittagong shows up in India instead of Bangladesh. Portions of Africa is missing.Buy a good globe even if it's for a small child who may not be ready for Geography lessons. It would be sad if the child turns out to be attentive and learns all the wrong lessons.
3,Not Very Christmas Themed,"I enjoy The Simpsons too much to say I don't like this dvd, but I have to say I ordered this thinking it would have Christmas themes.There was only one truly Christmas themed episode on here, and the rest tie into Christmas very loosely.I still get a kick out of watching the episodes, but if you are looking for a straight-up Christmas themed dvd then you may want to re-think this one."
4,Love the simpsons,"Good collection of episodes for the price. My family members are big Simpson fans, so we like collecting both the seasons and the specials. Funny, funny stuff."
4,A Motown Enthusiasts Must Have Book,"This is a brand new, year 2001 soft back, 384 page book. It features a great 32 page full color section with 50 photos. More than 100 rare photos are included. A host of black and white vintage photos appear along with interesting text throughout the volume. Chapters provide in depth coverage of nearly 100 stars of the golden era of Motown. There is a wealth of information here. You'll find a Motown 1959 - 1972 ""Defining the Sound of Young America"" chapter included. Motown music fans will find this an interesting read and great reference."
5,Encyclopedic detail and accuracy fleshed out into stories.,"Bill Dahl is often consulted by other authors to check facts before they publish their works. Now we get the direct line. This book can be read as a reference work or for entertainment, as all the names and dates are seamlessly and accurately included in the real Motown story: Who made the music, from the biggest stars to unsung virtuoso session men; when, where, and, how. A must for any fan of popular music. Oh yeah, lots of great photos, too."
5,Get this card... your digital camera will thank you!,"The low capacity cards that digital cameras come with today are such a joke! By getting this card, I can spend more time shooting pictures, which is perfect for getting cutting edge images on to my web site. Oh yeah, get the Flashlink reader, it will save you so much time getting those images off your digital camera and into your PC!"
3,Enjoyable read.,While I did enjoy the book (I read it in only two days) I did like the original Joshua better.
5,My 8th Girzone read...LOVE IT!,"After reading my 1st book by Father Girzone I knew I was hooked. Yes, His writing IS simplistic but you must consider that he is reaching out to a targeted audience. His writing is easy reading for all! Joshua is Jesus come to help the children in a religious torn community. This makes a wonderful bedtime story as well. Need help finding Jesus in your life....find Joseph Girzone 1st!!"
5,A deeply moving sequel to Joshua. Another beautiful story.,"Joshua, whom we soon realize is someone very special, returns in this book to a town torn apart by religious intolerance and violence. A parable for the situation in Ireland, as well as other places, it continues to answer that question ""What would happen if Jesus returned?"" This deeply moving book will make you laugh, bring a tear to your eye, and, most importantly, give you and your heart something to ponder"
3,Glad to be finished,I think that this book was moving in its own way but it just kept repeating the same moral over and over again. Although i have never read a book like this one before it did not impress me too much.
5,Joshua & Children,"This is an easy reading, but profound, story of what children can do to change the prejudices of their elders."
5,Great service,Truly love the writing of Joseph Girzone the series of Joshua books. You get so wrapped up in them you don't want to put them down. Great service; had in less than a week. Thanks!
4,The story was very interesting and the book worth reading.,I enjoyed the characters in the book and also the story really kept my interest. The one thing I did not like about the book was the counties that were mentioned are not counties of West Virginia. I am from WV. Charleston and Huntington were mentioned though which is accurage.
4,"Nice CD, but mislabelled","This CD is not Touch Sampler 5, which has not yet been released. This is Touch Sampler 00, released to commemorate the millenium. It's a nice CD, and the track listing is right, but the product title is incorrect. See [...]"
4,Colleen - Colleen Et Les Botes À Musique,"I can't imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box -- its tones are set in a specific pattern, and it doesn't deviate from that at all. But Colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again. By mixing the traditional plucked sounds with their re-processed and synthesized counterparts, she manages to evoke a fairy tale mysticism. ""What's is a Componium, Part 1"" goes from thick sonics to singular tones at the end. And even it ""Charles's Birthday Card"" relies solely on iterations of Pop Goes the Weasel, ""Will You Gamelan For Me?"" is its own creation immediately. The tinkling comes fast and furious on ""What's is a Componium, Part 2,"" a track that sparkles like moondust. ""Calypso in a Box"" shows off the more processed side, and has an almost Senor Coconut feel for its short running time. The standout piece here is the final track, ""I'll Read You a Story,"" which appeared on an earlier album, but is always welcome anywhere."
5,"Great Collection, Please read review",All original hits and songs.This collection has gathered together two separate music disc's and slipped them into one cardboard sleeve. The titles are:1. Absolutely the Best of the Sixties2. The Psychedelic SixtiesThese two are complete with their own artwork and disc's. Great way to get both titles if you don't already have. I already did so be careful.
3,Good movie but not great.,This movie is interesting in that Altman directed it. It is okay but not more.
2,A disappointment,"Altman has moments. Early in his career, these moments came often: ""M*A*S*H"" and ""The Long Goodbye,"" ""Nashville"" and ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller."" But he also had disasters and disappointments. This lackluster, tedious picture belongs in the latter folder. There is an utter lack of narrative momentum, Carradine and Duvall are a real bore, and the use of radio bits fails to add much. No one needs to see this movie."
5,A Depression-era tragic romance that's quintessential Altman,"Keith Carradine as Bowie and Shelly Duvall as Keechie inhabit the mouldering hamlets of the 1930s south so naturally and unaffectedly that your throat tightens. This softer, dreamier Bonnie & Clyde-type tale (filmed in 1941 by Nicholas Ray as ""They Live By Night"")stands, with ""The Long Goodbye"" at the pinnacle of Robert Altman's extraordinary 1970s body of work -- even above ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" & ""Nashville."" Shot like old sepia photographs by Jean Boffety, the film boasts extraordinary supporting work by Bert Remsen, John Shuck, the pre-""Cuckoo's Nest"" Louise Fletcher, and one unforgettable little girl. Why this masterpiece is all but forgotten is baffling: it's in a royal line of American movies dealing with average men and women trying to live in the twilight between decency and crime."
3,the demi-penultimate,"Whilst being a superbly laid out reference for a select few knots, it does not, unfortunately live up to it's title. Recommended for novices, clubs and schools etc it is not for the serious knotter like myself who eagerly lifted it off the shelf only to find yet another rehash of a few items... Nonetheless well produced and illustrated, very good for it's class. well Done. Peter."
2,Its Blaaaaaaa,Its full of pitures and not what I thought it would of been. There are better books then this one I would pass it up if I had known.
5,The Shawnee Menance,"This book grabs your attention from the very beginning and holds it to the ending. A must read adventure of the life & death struggle that early Americans faced in the late 1700's on our own soil. We are anxiously awaiting Roy Hays' next book in ""The Kentucky Scout Series""."
4,The Shawnee Menace,"The book recounts a harrowing adventure, but ultimately it is the fearless nature of these people and their indefatigable will to fight back and survive that shines through. Without a doubt arousing tale of the heroic age of the pioneer exploration."
2,Cups are too thick and molded,"The bra is too ""molded"" for my taste. The cups are very thick and feel to the breast the way a helmet feels to a head. It does have a good basic design but I will be returning it because of the uncomfortable density of the cups."
2,Cone Boobs,"I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it, but this bra is just not as good. The quality is not great; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff. When I tried it on, the bra separated my boobs very far apart. It made me look like a 1950's housewife with cone boobs. No cleavage, total separation, very pointy. Just not attractive.As for the sizing, I didn't feel that the cups were too small. I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional. The cups just made my chest look unattractive."
3,This Fit was Odd,"I ordered 2 Le Mystere Bra's I am a 32 DDD. One fit well but this one seemed very small I was hanging out top and sides. I had to return this one, I would order 1-2 sizes up."
2,Cute bra but bad elasticity in bands and no support,"The elastic used for the band very easily loses it's elasticity and thus loses shape quickly (after one wear I noticed the difference). For a molded style, this bra loses it's use after a week. It's pretty but poorly engineered."
4,great lift,"I bought this bra a month ago and using it for daily wear and so far I'm very happy with the fit and comfort. It gives great shape and lift for my petite bust (32C) without the ""push up"" effect. This is my first le mystere bra, so I cannot compare it to other models of this brand but compared to other brands I've used so far I believe this brand is worth the popularity. In terms of sizing: I think it is true to size in terms of band and cups (at least for me). And the fit: It lifts up well and comfortable enough for all day wear. The bra has convertible straps which can also be worn criss/cross but cannot be removed. The straps are kinda decorated, but wide. This may provide more comfort for larger cups but I personally prefer thinner spaghetti-strapped bras and find them more convenient to wear with tank tops. Overall I like the bra and would consider buying more bras from the same brand if not the same model."
1,Awful fit,I wasn't thrilled with the fit of this bra. It was stiff and the edges were so pronounced that even my thickest sweater couldn't hide them.
3,Fun and surprinley challenging for a kids game.,This game was really fun and it wasn't too easy like the other Rugrat's games i have played. The only thing that irritates the hell out of me is collecting the hidden funny money to unlock the special mini games. There's an area in the game where there is tons of funny money but its impossible to get to. But overall it's a fun game and especially if you a Rugrat's fan.
5,My son loves this game!,"I wanted to say that I just bought the Rugrats game for PlayStation 2 for my 10 yr old son. Although I have not played it, he enjoys it if I sit in the family room and watch him play. I must say, every time I glance at the TV he is playing some new adventure. He is hooked to say the least! He likes it because it has the real Rugrats Nickelodeon characters and I like it because it is not obnoxiously violent like some other games. Two thumbs up from a parent!"
2,Probably for Little Little Kids Only,"Maybe I didn't give the game a chance, but I couldn't because I would get motion sick too quickly. Maybe it's the very bright colors or the high-pitched music or the constantly going around in circles, but I was hanging over the side of my TV, turning green within 15 minutes every time I tried to play this. I was on the Baby Easy level, too, and I didn't find it all that easy, but I'm not a kid. No doubt it's probably a lot of fun later on when you get vehicles and stuff, but I couldn't even put together the snowman in the beginning levels. To its credit, the Baby Easy level does let you win even when your skills are horrible because I was a huge failure as far as navigating a river, and the game still applauded me and advanced me to the next level. (And still I couldn't put together the snowman. I am such a loser.)"
2,Doesn't lock well,"The accuracy of the rule and ruggedness of construction seem satisfactory. Unfortunately the lock mechanism doesn't work well, the rule moves when pushed even when the rule is locked tightly. I cannot tighten the lock enough to keep the rule from moving when it is forcefully pressured."
4,Great little square for the price,"When I bought this square I considered it a disposable unit that would probably get bent broken or stolen within short order. After checking it against my Starrett and Mitutoyo squares I was surprised to find out that it was very accurate. Surprisingly, it is also pretty durable. While I am not a big fan of the zinc heads on most consumer grade squares, this one is well made, accurately machined and so far, durable. The etched and painted blade is easy to read although not as easy as the Starrett or Mitutoyo ""satin chrome"". Granted, you can buy 8 of these squares for the price of one of the Starrett or Mitutoyo units.While I would never consider replacing my 6"" Mitutoyo square with this one I will not hesitate to run out and buy another, or two or three Swanson squares when my current one finally does get bent or disappears.Overall, I would give this square five stars for value and four stars for quality."
1,Terrible motivational film,"If you like crappy motivational films that make your employees feel like they are being brainwashed when they watch the videos you present them than Ride The High Places is just what you need. You should be ashamed of yourself if this crap inspired you to do anything in life. Useless video garbage, 18,000,000 thumbs down."
5,best of brenda lee,brenda lee little mis dynamite what a voice she used to visit australia to packed houses and is one of the best early rock nroll artists of all the girls this c.d. has most of her hits and a few extras on it its a pity she doesnt still perform as i am sure she would still pack the house wherever she performed another great record from amazon for my well played collection. jack darby australia
3,Better on an LP,"OK, I admit in advance that I am an LP/CD snob. I have several of these songs on LP and to my ears at least they sound much better. The cuts on this disc must be old AM radio versions as the sound quality is marginal at best. I actually had the opportunity to work with Brenda in New York many years ago and I can tell you, she deserves better."
5,"Pricey, but they are the best.",The bulbs are a little higher in price. However they are quality and stand up to rough use..You will get what you pay for.It was easy to find on Amazon.
4,Good replacement,"Great product is exactly what it says. Good replacement for my mirror which was broken. It is slightly different on the inside but the exterior, after installation, is unnoticeable."
3,Adequate with some issues,The mirror did fit the car after some playing around with what gaskets/foam to leave on. It does not seem to be able to totally tighten so there is a small gap where the mirror meets the weatherstripping. I am hoping this will not cause rust or other problems with the door.It did arrive quickly and the price was good.
2,Plagued with problems,I bought a Radeon 8500 to replace my Radeon 7000. When I first installed it the performance and frame rate just blew me away. But then I found out that my card has problems running games and 3d apps. I got a headache from trying to fix it and I'm going to have to send it back to ATI for a replacement.
5,"Great value, brute force","First off let me help you novices out there a little bit. Don't buy a video card because of its price, its hype, or its look, do your research! This card is excellent, it is blazingly fast, (it beats geforce 3), and it is a steal... BR>A key feature in the radeon 8500 is the programmable pixel shaders. Let me tell you a little more about them. Geforce 3, 4 and radeon 8500 all share them witht he exception with the Geforce 4 MX. The newest games will use programmable pixel shaders and if you don't have a video card that uses this, then you can't play it. The radeon beats its competition while being half the price! but be cautious because there has been driver issues with ATI and what seems to be ""cheating drivers""Pros:blazingly fastcomes from a respectable companyexcellent image qualitycons:driver issues"
4,great graphics for the money,"great for gaming. With dual head monitor support + DVI & TV out, the 64 MB memory on this Card and the extremely affordable pricepoint make it one of the best options available today. If you are a hard-core CG effects person, this won't be the best option, but otherwise, it is the way to go."
5,Never cease to AMAZE me,"OK! Sugar Rush was never my favorite song, but this CD has increaced my enjoyment of this song like 50000%!1. Sugar Rush- Like I said, not my favorite A*Teens song2. Sugar Rush (Earthboun's Sugarcrush mix Short)- O my gosh! Earthbound has taken a slower song and made it one of the BEST techno song i have ever heard!3. Sugar Rush (Earthbound's Sugarcrush mix Long)- As i have said in other interviews, this song only gets better as it gets longer!4. Sugar Rush (M 12 Mix)- Can you say, ""The Best remix EVER!"" It's like dance style, and the best. I can't say that enough!"
2,Biz JETS meaning jets with some piston aircraft in between,"When I bought this book I was hoping on getting a book covering only small jets! But what I got was a book including a lot of piston aircraft and a few airliners along with the biz JETS. Piston engine isn't a jet engine! Some informations that I would like to know on these ""jets"" are not there e.g. cruising alt. But the book has it's good sides to! The recognition part is very neat and I the thing that gives this book those two stars!"
1,"Cheesy, boring, move on......","I'll make this short. Terrible script with very forgettable acting. How'd they con Liam Nieson into this one? Extremely cheesy, not to mention lame, visual effects. It seemed they skimped on the screen writer to waste more money on worthless effects. Very boring sound effects, there's only so many times I can here a creaky door in 5.1 before I put the mute on. At least it was only a rental, however, it was late so it cost me 6 bucks, what a waste. I'm glad I didn't blindly pay 20 for this dog."
2,possibly the worst haunted house movie made,"This movie doesn't scare, it barely entertains and is frustrating to watch capable actors (Zita Jones and Nelson) in limited roles.The script is just plan bad, instead of showing realistic traditional ghost the producer decided to go with high dollar unrealistic special effects that are way overdone.I didn't hate the movie, but I was really disapointed."
2,"About as scary as a "" Facts of Life "" reunion special","The Haunting is incredibly mediocre, even to the point of making you laugh when you should be screaming. The plot is weak, the script is empty, and the acting is subdued. Well, what do you expect from a movie that has Zeta Jones in it? Actually, the scariest part of the movie is that they didn't allow a good actor who played a bit part ( Bruce Dern )to be the main character in the film. Trust me, you've seen this movie a hundred times before. Even The House On Haunted Hill was better than this turkey."
2,Poopy!,"Not scary, bad acting, boring story... One star added for some nifty special effects. I really wanted to like this movie, but alas, it was another ""Armageddon."""
2,WHY ?,"Do computer generated things scare you? They don't scare me.Do sets scare you? They don't scare me either.I understand that studios can't make money re-releasing old classics in theatres because of home video but why spend all that money trying to remake or even surpass something that is obviously the sum of its human parts, all of whom you won't or can't reuse?Isn't that like trying to be the first man on the moon - - - -again?Some scriptwriters and directors could make a biscuit and a glass of milk frightening.They used a super computer called talent.Please reboot."
4,Good nonetheless,"Many people have seen this movie, many didn't like it. I, on the other hand, thought it was alright. One complaint I've heard for this film like many remakes is that ""it wasn't like the original."" Hmm... do you think maybe that's because IT'S NOT THE ORIGINAL? In order to truly like a remake, you have to look past the fact that it is probably not gonna be even close to the original. However, it seems anytime Disney remakes something like Hercules and Mighty Joe Young, they get praised for it even though they take remakes way out of the original context. This movie wasn't too bad. It wasn't scary, but still not too bad. I found it more of a story than horror film."
3,Needed More Depth,"I really liked the idea of the story, especially Catherine Zeta-Jone's part in it, but was not pleased with the lack of demension. The story to me was flat. To me, there was no real Opening, Middle, and Ending. Everything just blended, and moved to quickly."
4,The Haunting,"I thought this was a great movie. Fine, so the story was average, but the fantastic effects and even better sound more than made up for it. I would recommend this film to anyone with a dolby digital setup, just sit back and feel the room shake!"
3,IT'S BETTER THAN THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT!,"I think that this and the Blair Witch Project were released at the same time(I could be wrong). If I had to pick which one I'd watch over again it would withoout any doubt be this one. And here's why. First of all at least this has ""real""actors(I must admit I don't mind seeing Catherine Zeta-Jones through out the movie) The story is sorta fun. I must admit during the end you might think WHAT IS THIS! But it is entertaining. The setting was very good that house that they used fit the mood quite well. As for the effects some were OVER DONE if you know what I mean. It just looked so fake. But then again don't expect GREATNESS from this movie. THEY DON'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THEY USE TO!"
1,the real horror in this horror movie,"When I first saw the preveiw for this movie it looked intriguingly scary. But that all changed when I actually saw it. I found it to be very boring. I was actully waiting to get scared. The preveiw for this movie was scarier.Also, the storyline was exceptionally weak and nearly drowned out by way too many special effects.this movie was just another ""tech show""."
1,"Horrible, not horror.","Wanna be scared? Watch this movie, it is horrible. More words would just be a waste here."
2,Slept like a baby...,"I watched this flick at 1 a.m. Afterwards, I had no trouble falling asleep. When is Hollywood going to realize that showing too much emphasis on visuals makes bad theater? Overdone, bombastic,predictable,CGI effects. The house looked too much like a gaudy museum with ridiculous fixtures. On the positive side,though, the sound effects were great. The bass notes were very well done, subtle shades of ghostly children whispering and eerie creaky sounds throughout the house were the real jewel in this film."
2,A Repetative Scare,"In The Haunting a group of people are told they would be paid if they stay in Haunting Hill for one night so a skeptic can prove his point that there is nothing to fear. It isn't long before there are attacks. Such as when the stairs one person is on collapses when he is over a story up, and when a mysterious oversized hand reaches and tries to grab one of the occupants. This movie starts out well because it's scary like it's supposed to be and is very unique, but you quickly notice it's also very repetative."
2,Razzle-Dazzle Special Effects and Nothing Else,"Unlike the smart and creepy 1963 original (of the same title) or the spine-tingling Shirley Jackson novel (titled ""The Haunting of Hill House""), Jan De Bont's brainless thriller ""The Haunting"" beats you mercilessly over the head with great special effects, but leaves you wondering where all the story and logic went. The film's razzle-dazzle visuals make it somewhat fun, but it's unescapably a downer."
2,ORIGINAL MUCH BETTER,THE ORIGINIAL OF THIS MOVIE WAS MUCH BETTER. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS IN THIS REMAKE ARE BETTER-BUT THE PLOT IS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL.
4,Pretty Good Flick,"Not so much scary as it is interesting, however some decent performances keep you involved. The story is a little drug out, as this could have been much better at 90 min. as opposed to its 115 min. run time worth seeing never the less."
2,"Ultimately, this one's a failure (though not without merit).","Four people are placed in a gigantic mansion as part of a study in fear, but they don't realize the house is actually haunted. Effects-heavy thriller features a decent beginning and a so-so cast (Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones are fine, Owen Wilson and Lili Taylor are spectacularly awful), but eventually falls apart in the last half-hour, with a barrage of cheesy special effects taking over. Add to that the predictability and the sappy conclusion and you have a movie that went from promising to big dud. It might, however, hold appeal to non-horror fans looking for a quick, undisturbing thrills (and it seems that that was the crowd this movie was aimed at). For everyone else, either stick with the original or see House on Haunted Hill for a real coaster ride of a haunted house thriller (Which also actually features better CGI effects, a surprise considering it only had 1/4 the budget of The Haunting)."
1,Numbingly bad.,"Only in this, the age of mediocrity, could a piece of rubbish like this get made. Owen Wilson turns in one of the worst performances in recent memory. This was made strictly for the idiots who find MTV worthwhile part of our culture."
1,One of the worst of 99...,"Question: How do you take an excellent cast, millions of dollars, top of the line FX, base it on a good movie only toturn it into a piece of unwatchable garbage? Answer: Let Jan de Bont direct it."
4,A good movie on a wonderful set,"This movie was one of the first movies I watched on DVD and I did not read the novel ""The Haunting of Hill House"". That said, I found the movie interesting in the beginning, slow in the middle and action packed at the end.The setting was beautiful and the house had a great gothic look to it, but maybe the house overshadowed the characters some? The movie centered around one nervous character finding out who she really is and then defeating the bad guy at the end. The other actors were just innocent by-standers through most of the movie which hurt the film.I gave it four stars because of Zeta-Jones and the setting itself. This is not a terrible movie, but it could have been so much more."
1,A Truley Horrible Horror Film,"A truly horrible horror film. Over use of not so special ""special effects"" attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum, and that the characters were never developed or interesting. The only thing that's scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after 30 years. The other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that I actually paid to see it."
4,Fun but Ludicrous,"This is a great 'B' movie.There is no real comparison with the first one (1963).That one was an intellectual haunted house story. This one is just juvenile.The idea that the Dudleys,man and wife caretakers, could take care of a forty acre lawn as well as a monstrous castle by themselves struck me as hilarious.""No one from the town will come here"" she says.After the catastrophic damage in the house, I really felt for the Dudleys.The picture was just fun."
1,"Wow, What a Disappointment","It's really difficult to make a good movie with bad material. But making a bad movie with good material must be easy---Jan DeBont proves it with this turkey. Shirley Jackson's story was a spooky classic. Robert Wise's B & W version was excellent and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. And HE did it without special effects; just sound, shadows, and camera angles. This movie could have been so much better by relying on the original premise and forgetting all the comic book special effects. Mr. DeBont is proving that he's better as a technician than a director. Liam Neeson must have lost a bet to go along with this."
2,Promises alot. Delivers little.,"I was really stoked to watch this movie. And I honestly enjoyed the first half of the it - the setup. I love the actors here. The look and feel of the picture was great, dug the vibe. A bunch of strangers come together for an insomnia experiment in a haunted house in New England. The Dr, Liam Neeson hasn't told them that he wants to study their reaction to fear. They stay in the house a couple of days and it begins to have an effect on them. Lili Taylor's charactor in particular.That's about as far as I can go w/o spoilage. I'll just say it becomes predictable haunted house story after that. I didn't get the thrills I was expecting. Such interesting characters. Such potential. I've rarely seen a movie that was such a let down."
2,Microwaved horror,"Hollywood reheats a classic, but this cheap serving is hardly very appetizing. This remake throws some heavy morsels of CGI down your throat and will give you indigestion.Same basic story, some people volunteer to stay in an extravagant mansion. This time they aren't told about the house's dark past. They believe they are part of a study on insomnia. The truth is they are part of a controlled experiment on group fear.Now I thought this was a nice alteration to the story. But unfortunately it starts to get extremely ridiculous. Nothing subtle here, there are plenty of cheap scares--like ghostly images or moving statues. As it turns out this house is basically a holding cell for dead children's souls. The evil landlord's spirit keeps watch over them in this purgatory. Great, a perverted pedaphile ghost.This turns into more of a goofy adventure flick. No spooky atmosphere or mystery. No suspense. No reason to bother."
1,NEGATIVE 100 STARS. WORST FILM OF THE DECADE.,"This is a travesty, not only of Shirley Jackson's creepy, intelligent, incomparable ""The Haunting of Hill House"", but of the original ""The Haunting"". It's a ghost story for video-game-addicted morons. I've lost all respect I may have had for Neeson, Zeta-Jones and Taylor. This will be a permanent blotch on their resumes. If they were smart (ha ha) they might want to consider just whiting this one out! I won't apologize for sounding spiteful, either; when one of this century's best 'ghost' stories was turned into an excuse for lots of gimmicky, asinine computer graphics, instead of being crafted into the eerie filmed masterpiece it deserved to be, I was angered and even more disgusted with Hollywood, its crummy formulas and lowest-common-denominator scriptwriting than I ever was before."
2,CGI no substitute for story,"This re-make fails to evoke true terror, trading for easier shocks thanks to easily distinguished CGI effects. Might have worked as an original idea, but being a re-make of a classic movie, itself based on a classic novel, necessitates living up to the original, which this movie did not."
1,Too awful to be funny,"I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad, SO corny, SO awfully un-scary that I couldn't even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through (and I, a lover of all things spooky!). I do recall however three things about this movie: the directing was awful, the script was terrible and Cathy Jones (I didn't know who she was - she hadn't married the old man yet which really launched her career) gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie. No! I speak in haste - there were a number of 'worst' things about this movie.If you want to be creeped-out, read the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson). If you must see the story in movie form, watch the old black and white original from 1963 starring Julie Harris. It's dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo.Happy Hauntingness,Wind in Hare"
1,Just skip it.,"1. This is one of those rare movies where it's so lame, that I didn't / couldn't finish it.2. This movie is so lame, that spending more time writing a detailed review is a waste of time."
3,"Great special effects, looks good an DVD, not too scary","This movie started out good. The sound was great and it actually scared me a couple times. BUT towards they end they had the oppurtunity to wrap it up with a good ending, they ended up using too many special effects. The acting was ok but the script tried to spoon feed you the plot too much. The color, sound, and picture quality was very good on DVD so you just like watching ""clear"" movies this would be a good choice."
2,Not Oscar Material,"Okay, this movie may not be nominated for an Oscar for best Movie, or best acting, or not even for FX. However, it is a good movie where you can spend 108 minutes. The critics listed above were too harsh, and I almost did not buy the movie. I am glad I did, and will watch it a few more times. Zeta-Jones is a pretty girl, she has nice outfits in the movie. The haunted hause is nicely decorated, so why not watch it a few more times. Please keep in mind, sometimes movies are for a good pass-time, and this one is one of those."
3,Good rental,Not a bad movie but not a great one either. From an entertainment stand point it was good. As with most remakes of old horror moives a good script is hard to find. It is an old movie that unfortunately has been copied many times; so that takes away from the story. But as a whole it is a good movie. There are enough creepy scenes that make it a cut above the average fright flick.
1,This movie insulted my intelligence...,"along with the new Starwars. It is one of those movies that you want your 8 bucks and 2 hours of your life back afterwards. The plot is lame. The psycho-thriller classic turns a flop & dumb special effects-fest. I recommend ""the Matrix"" ""Taxi Driver (remastered)"" etc. for your holiday viewing."
3,Great... except for the stupid ending!,"The haunting was a very suspenceful movie, it had great sets and special effects. I was really into the movie untill she found out she was related to the ghosts. And the put the worst line i ever had in the movie, that my family has laughed at for over a year. Whoever wrote the line ""It's not about that It's about family, WELL I'M FAMILY TOO GRANDPA!!!!"" should be extermely imbarsed. From that line on the movie was terrible and stupid. So if you want to see a scary movie with good special effects see the haunting, and if you want to laugh at the worst line ever you have to see it!"
4,not the best storyline or acting but! the soundtrack is the star,"if you want to give your new home theatre setup with the new subwoofera great workout, then this is one of the dvd's to get, preferably DTS5.1if you can, the plot as it is pretty ordinary, the acting even more so,the soundtrack, great, 4 stars for the soundtrack,"
2,Beware of Evil Capitalists (and ghost movies about them),"Some day Lili Taylor will land that role in a film which will show the world what a high-calibre actress she really is. THE HAUNTING is not that film. What a thankless part for Ms. Lili. What a thankless film. The scariest thing about this movie must have been the bill for the c.g.i. effects that the studio received. I mean, the movie had a moment or two of tension, but on the whole, I was bored.There was nothing new here: the fury of an evil, dead capitalist and the pain inflicted on his mostly children workers--and his family--just can't seem to get out of the house. So! The evil men do does live on! How original! I'm reaching for sarcasm which is never pretty, so I will end here. This movie was the pits."
1,Must I even give it one star?,"Crass, vulgar, ridiculous farce of a film that regrettably retains none of the keen psychological portraits in Jackson's novel. Believe me, I am no stickler for slavish literary adaptations. When changes need to be made for cinematic purposes, I utterly support a director's choice to do so. Here, however, Jackson's work is not even on display in spirit; instead, this juvenile, special effects laden mess is marred by a juvenile screenplay and lousy performances from good actors. Even Liam Neeson publicly declared his utter disgust with this production. If only the filmmakers had taken the Robert Wise film version as inspiration; it is by no means faultless but is a masterpiece compared to this dreck. Only those folks who adore CGI will appreciate this film, and to them I say ""enjoy."" To those looking for characters or true chills, try ""The Innocents,"" ""The Changeling,"" ""The Legend of Hell House,"" or the original ""The Haunting"" instead."
2,THE HAUNTING,ALL I CAN SAY IS SEE THE ORIGINAL WITH JULIE HARRIS. SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE NEW. THE NEW DEPENDS ON COMPUTER EFFECTS. WHICH WERE PRETTY COOL. BUT DID NOT SAVE THE MOVIE FROM ITS DOWNFALL. ITS LACK OF STORY WAS LAME.NOT SCARY WHAT SO EVER. SEE THE ORIGINAL. YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED.
1,The house out-performs Catherine Zeta-Jones,"I honestly can't understand why Zeta-Jones' badly-scripted part is stealing the show with these reviewers; her cliched ""liberated woman with just a hint of vulnerability"" part is no more of a highlight than the rest of this awful movie. Bitter, am I? When the '60s version of a movie has more scares than the '90s version, be very afraid."
2,The Audience Laughed the Whole Way Through...,"It was funny, bad acting, stupid scripts and over the top special effects! There was nothing else to do but to laugh at how stupid it was. This movie good be 1 hour shorter if it wasn't for all the repeated scences of just looking at the house from the outside. And no, Catherine Zeta Jones didn't save the movie."
2,This is not a horror movie.,"This is not a horror movie- it is an interesting science fiction movie. However, it is a science fiction movie with bad special effects and a bad dialogue. The acting is good, but that just doesn't make up for it. I didn't buy this movie- I went to see it once in the theatre, and that was enough for me. If you want a real horror movie, check out The Sixth Sense."
5,The Haunting,"Catherine Zeta Jones and Owen Wilson star in this creepy thriller! This is one scary story of a haunted house that wont rest! Its not like House on Haunted Hill where the house locks you in, this one is just trying to scare you to death while you reside in it! Watch this movie!"
4,Great Mystery - Not So Great Horror Flick,"If you like super-natural mysteries, then you'd like this film. It is technically a horror film, but it's really not that frightening (though there is a scene in the movie that made my mother jump about three feet), and as a result, is not for people that watch horror films for the fright. As a mystery, however, it is really quite good, and deserves to be watched over and over, just so you can find all the hidden clues for the answer at the end."
4,NOT BAD FOR A REMAKE,"This is, of course, not much like the orginal(which I still think is better), but has some good effects and a decent story. I have it, but I bought the original first. This is a Hollywood story. The original is more believable. Watch them both."
3,not-so-cheap thrills,"I'll agree with everyone that this movie wasn't really faithfull to the novel and would have fared better if it had relied on a more subtle approach to a good scare (like the '63 version and the Sixth Sense) instead of a special effects exravaganza but folks let's face it, this was a 'summer' movie and summer movies mean one thing... mondo special effects, huge budgets and big sound! I am a lover of all types of movies and summer movies with all their noise and CGI are an American tradition now just like baseball and apple pie and we should just enjoy them for what they are and stop complaining. Let's save the more intellectual films for the winter and spring months. Bring on the popcorn! Can't wait for The Haunting to come out on DVD."
2,Expected More,"I thought this movie would be something more, but the teaser trailer was far better than the movie! I understood that it wasn't a jump out horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller thing, and still, no good. Maybe the only thing good in it was Catherine Zeta-Jones that neat merry-go-round / mirror room, and the special effects.. I also found the other characters in the movie quiet boring, and the plot confused me until the third time I watched it. But if you like slow-paced movies that eventually end, then this is for you."
2,...and what a feeble haunting it is!,"No, no, no! What went wrong? Big-budget film with great actors, and what do we get? A visually appealing film with a completely flat Liam Neeson and a paper-thin storyline. Catherine Zeta Jones tries to charm her way through, but even though she does an okay job, the movie is still bad. Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson also try to add flavour to it all, but cannot manage to save the day. All we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content. It all seems to be over before it really begins, and nothing really makes much sense. And the eerie mood is almost totally absent. Not a good omen for a ""horror"" movie, is it?I just can't believe what went wrong for Neeson. Usually he drags a movie up, not down! Watch House on Haunted Hill instead, if you're into ""stuff-some-people-into-a-haunted-house-and-see-if-the-survive"" movies. Then you'll se how a proper haunting should be :)"
4,A misunderstood movie...,"This movie had the most potential of any movie I've ever seen, however, somewhere, someone messed up. I like this movie, however. It offers a creepy escape on a Friday night.Final verdict: Worth a look, but only if you are willing to accept it as just a fun and creepy movie."
3,Haunting - Great Amusement Park Ride - Average Film,"If you watch movies on your home theater system more for the effects and thunder of the subwoofer, then this movie rocks. If not, and you still watch movies to be entertained, then you will be kinda disappointed with this movie. It has some of the deepest bass extension in the LFE section of the soundtrack that I have ever encountered in my system. However, that was the best part of the movie. The sound effects. Awesome. The movie... Oh yeah... there was a movie. It was OK. Nothing more. But the effects make it worth the buy if you have a Dolby Digital system."
2,Really boring,"This is probably the worst ""horror"" movie I have ever seen! Don't see this unless you want to be bored to death!"
2,It had a lot of potential,"If this movie had been played for more than just cheep thrills, it could have been good. It had an array of good, if not overly impressive, actors, good special effects, and a good basis novel. Unfortunately, the acting skips around from histrionics to casual acceptance where there should be histrionics to just plain silliness. This is a neat movie to watch for some brainless eye-candy, but it really lost a lot of energy in the translation from big-screen to video.And completely unrelated, but the ending scene sounds like an anti-Russian lobbyist. ""I won't let you kill any more children, Ukraine! Go to hell!"""
3,NOT UP TO THE ORIGINAL,"One of the best actors in contemporary films is Lili Taylor. She was the only element of this film to make it worth viewing. Everyone was likeable, but the screeplay's potential, about the house's secret, never climbed to the level of suspense. The ghostly manifestations scream ""computer"" and this works against any creation of an eerie atmosphere. The one excellent eerie moment is Lili Taylor looking at her reflection in the mirror. One thing that amazed me, apart from the screenplay, was how attracted I was to Lili Taylor whom I never previously regarded in that way. Catharine Zita Jones played the sexy character, but, for my money, Lili Taylor was far more appealing in both personality and physical look."
2,"Good special effects, lame otherwise","The special effects are the only thing that saved this movie. The characters are shallow, the plot is either non-existant or predictable, and the ending is unbelievable. If you're interested in this movie, I would recommend the 1963 version instead. It doesn't rely so heavily on special effects and in turn has great characterization and plot (not to mention a more believable setting). The DVD takes longer than usual to cue up or didn't work at all in both my players. (I tried two different discs, same problem.)"
2,"Great - then ZZZZZZ - then EGADS, what a waste!","Sad Sad SadThe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a much higher caliber actress, along with Liam Neeson's lame attempts to make this movie palatable is such a crime.... almost as if the movies' set was haunted!The beginning of the movie has so much promise - you feel the backround of the centralized story has promise, you get suckered into the premise this house has to offer - then, and without warning, the silliness begins.It is as if you've been thrown into an Addams Family reunion - the story line starts to wander, the characters continue to wander, and ideas and solutions pop-up without a warning or explanation...To say a ""horror"" movie isn't believable almost sounds absurd, but this movie gets you suckered in, then throws you on the floor flat...This is a definite - do not buy, borrow or rent! Just wait for cable!"
2,Haunting.....sort of,"The newly updated film version of Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is somewhat acceptable. If your looking for some good effects and a strong character lead, ""The Haunting"" is your cup of tea. For the rest of us who want something scary, ""The Haunting"" was definitely not it. For the first hour of the movie, it's creepy and fun as we explore the house along with the actors. But as the second half begins to roll, ""The Haunting"" loses steam. If your a person who enjoys the sights and sounds of a high budget film, buy ""The Haunting"". But for those who want class in their horror flicks, definitely leave this one out of the collection."
1,INSOMNIA CURE! WATCH THIS MOVIE!,THE MOVIE TAKES SO LONG TO GET INTERESTING YOUR ASLEEP BEFOREYOU KNOW IT.THANK GOD I RENTED THIS!
4,Hauntingly Scary!!,"I saw the original and this movie is just as good. That is really rare. Most re-made versions arent as good. I liked the actors and the special effects are great. I will be first on-line to buy this movie when it comes out. Dont hesitate to see this movie, as well as the original of course."
2,Too Long To Get To The Point,This was another one of those movies that mostly had it's special effects support it. Don't get me wrong Catherin Zeta-Jones was hot as usual but she needed a bigger role. This movie was good in many ways but not for horror like maybe adventure would have suited it fine but not horror. As a matter of fact I would like to take this opportunity to say that this movie is the least scariest that I have ever seen but still a good storyline goes behind it. So yes this movie would be worth renting.
1,Just terrible,"No, it's not as good as the original. But let's rate it on it's own merit - hmmm, it has none! This movie sucks whether you compare it to the original or let it try and stand alone! One of the worst movies of recent years, it has ridiculous acting (except for Liam Neeson, but it's not like he's good, I don't know why he did this) and one of the stupidest plots I have ever seen in my life. This is such a waste, don't buy it, don't rent it. This is a terrible movie. Period."
1,Absolutely horrible,"Movies don't get much worse than this one, folks. The plot was poor and the acting was terrible. The scene near the beginning with the two ladies prancing around the house was incredibly lame. The filmmakers tried to overcome the shoddy storyline by tossing in some mediocre special effects. If they were intended to be a distraction, they didn't work.I have to admit, my review is based only on the first 30 or so minutes of the movie. That was all I could take before I got up off the couch, rewound the film, and promptly returned to the video store."
5,Good Movie,This is a good movie with a star packed cast. With many twists and turns you never know what is going to happen next. Love It
3,Nice Try...But....Doesn't live up to original,"This movie is allright, not the best. It is loosely based on ""The Haunting"" wich came out in the early 60s(I Think 1963). The original was alot better. It(This one) starts out similar to the original, but then changes. It adds the Childrens' ghosts and those things. Though I think the door might have been made similar to a book they find in the 1963 movie(The door with hell and purgatory). It doesn't have the neat, and dizzying, camera angles from the first one. Instead it adds alot of special affects(Wich I will give them credit for doing a good job on, some credit that is). But compared to the first one.....It is really not that good or scary. If you want to see a good scary movie, than see the Original ""The Haunting"", Or the ""Innocents""(Wich is very scary), or ""The Changeling"". Leave this one on the shelf, Save your money and get a real, scary horror movie, such as the ones I mentioned above."
1,I'm Haunted - I Will NEVER Get Those 2 Hours of My Life Back,"If you want a movie with a poor script, poor acting, and poor scares this movie is for you. We were hoping for a scary movie, but instead we came across this comedy. Lili Taylor is horrible as Eleanor, a woman driven to save everyone else who deserved to die for deciding to be in this attempt at a production. Liam Neeson, what were you thinking?"
1,Very sorry indeed.,"Not scary, not original, bad computer fx, bad acting and no suspense! What a waste of money..."
4,Its no exorsist but should be seen.,"I liked this movie, it had some realy good special effects and a good story line, it is mildly scary but not nearly as scary as i thought it would be, and some parts were predictable. I think it could have been made a little better, but its entertaining and definatley worth seeing."
3,Excellent Premise But fails on many levels,This was a great premise update the 1963 version of the movie with the same name and make with big budget special effects. It works for the great looking mansion and the special effects and some truly scary parts but on other levels it just fails. Mainly the cast a good cast with Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones and lilly Taylor they are wasted and those to characters who in the begining who are sent into town but never hear from them again what is up with that? Directed By Jan de Bont famous for speed this could have been truly scary and exciting. But it is only partly scary and exciting. But i reccomend it for the special effects and the production design.
1,Dismal,"I guess the part I liked best was where Eleanor discovered that she was related to the ghost haunting the house. It was really believable. Tears came to my eyes it was so touching. Then, when the cherubs on the wall came to life, I was even more moved as there little souls finally were freed to go to heaven. That was really touching. I am just amazed at the screenwriter's brilliance. And all those special effects! He was so clever to add those. It must of taken a great deal of intelligence to have everything--even the ceilings come alive. I feel richer as a human for investing my time in this masterpiece."
1,what a joke,"this movie is so stupid. waste of anybody's money or time. Not even Catherine Zeta Jones can make it seem worth watching. no parts in the movie were scary at all. In fact, was this a comedy by mistake?"
1,"TRITE, BORING, DISAPPOINTING","It just didn't work. Astounding sets alone can't create on-screen chemistry. The story line and performances were weak, and, even worse, I didn't think it was scary...and wasn't that the whole idea? I left the theatre feeling cheated. This movie was just plain DUMB!"
4,Best low sound from your DVD,"If you like very low sound, I really mean low, with a subwoofer, then buy this one. You can impress your friends by seeing this movie at midnight. This DVD is so real you don't want to sleep after watching."
2,Poor plot,"The actors in the movie are a great bunch, but when the plot is very weak, you dont get very much. I mean Liam Neeson! Hes a great actor, but was very weak in this movie. it wasnt scary at all, the the end of the movie was bad. There was maybe one scary part, which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump. That was all. I dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies, b/c it was a polar opposite."
1,Catherine Zeta-Hipboots,"A fan of both Jackson's novel and the 1963 Robert Wise adadptation, I went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming. It was worse. In fact, it was so bad, I laughed my way through it (along with the two friends who accompanied me). There are so many digital effects that the house seems alive, indeed, but computer geeks set free with a big budget don't creep me out. They're just annoying. So is the movie. The house shape-shifts, sighs, moans--hell, even the door-knocker gets a reaction shot. Zeta-Jones's leather hipboots manage to out-act her, and Lili Taylor is hilariously bad as Eleanor. (""I've got the save the children!"" Wha?) Liam Neeson is even less interesting than he was in THE PHANTOM MENACE, if that's possible. Let's just put it this way: I just sacrificed 10 minutes of my time to write this review so that you won't waste 1 hour and 40 minutes of yours on this film."
2,this movie sucks!,"This is one of the most horrible movies i've ever seen. It starts off promising with a creepy house and an old story of how the house is haunted. From there it gets worse and worse and worse until the ending, which might be the dumbest ending i've ever had to sit through. This movie only deserves one star but Catherin Zeta Jones looked very very attractive in the movie (like always) and i had to give it an extra star just for her.P.S.what's up with her and Micheal Douglas, that's just a shame."
1,ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE,"How any sane, intelligent person(perhaps that explains it!) could recommend this overblown crap-fest is beyond me. Quite posibbly the worst horror movie ever made. Get the original 1963 version or read the classic novel--BUT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS TRAIN WRECK OF A MOVIE!"
1,Hollywood has run out of ideas......,"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't stay awake to see this complete video. Whenever a cliche' scare comes up, I fall asleep....and this was often. I saw the original 60's version and, sorry, but that one was a snoozer too. I think this story could be phenomenally scary, but the right party has yet to make it.The only really scary thing about this movie is looking like Lily Taylor and having to share the screen with Catherine Zeta-Jones. She's a Goddess!!"
1,Typical Hollywood pulp,"Third grade mentality, third-rate dialog. Not for adults. Egads, I actually bought the DVD. Shame on me."
1,A waste of time and money,"Good cast, high budget movie. The movie was supposed to concentrate on a group of 4 people (all insomniacs) who were going to stay in an isolated house, to test their reactions to pressure situations.Was it the lack of direction, the lack of story line, or the lack of interest from the actors that led this movie to become a flop ?Watching this movie was a chore. It was about as exciting as ""The Avengers"".There's not a lot that can be said, apart from save your money and get a better movie (The Sixth Sense was made on a cheaper budget & was far more exciting)."
1,TERRIBLE ATTEMPT AT GOTHIC HORROR,"""The Haunting"" is certainly one of the worst films I've seen. While it starts off promisingly, the sets and special effects become so mind numbingly overdone that the thread of the original story is lost completely. It is replaced by a story that is not only derivitive and banal, but laugably contrived as well. This movie proves that even with a classic novel and a classic movie, a remake can totally botch its rendering beyond all recognition. Recommended for the film audience that prefers style far above substance."
2,"IF IT AIN'T BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT","""The Haunting"" with Julie Harris was so good--even better for its black and white medium, which enhances the sense of the macabre and general off-kilterness of the set. Why don't they remake ""The Wizard Of Oz?"" Now, there's a picture that could be made MUCH pertier with modern cinematography. The cheap set and old theatre-style acting throw a damper on what's still is a great universal story."
3,A Wanting Haunting,"This film recycles every haunted house cliche from the black-and-white movie era, and the tone of the movie often veers into camp (especially with Lili Taylor's performance). The back story is muddied and incoherent too. It's a shame that with such a large budget for special effects and with so many talented actors, The Haunting doesn't generate more thrills for the audience."
1,99.9 FAILURE!,"The only thing in this ""horror"" film that made it was the house and Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, looking good!, but the story was so forced, it never caught any horror, the special effects were cartoon like, not one bit frighting, the original movie and the short story will scare the pants off you, and why?, because your mind can conger up all the horror you want, your minds eye will take you to all those dark corners you fear, oh, and another thing that ruined the movie for me is, Owen Wilson, can't stand him!, how he ever got in movies is beyond me!, ignore this cluttered up movie and go to the original black and white one and get set to be terrified!"
1,Some movies are just born bad...,"To say I was disappointed in this movie would be an understatement. To classify this as a horror film would be just plain wrong. While it achieves its goal to tell a good story, the chills and thrills just aren't there. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone with a serious yen to be scared out of their wits. If you want a real frightening tale, I recomend Rose Red. That's how a haunted house story should be told."
1,"Worst Film Ever Made, ever!",It's just bad. I've already written one review but I feel its my duty to make everyone avoid this hideous and vile mess at all costs. Rent the original!
2,Read the Book,What made the book horrorific/good was not the special effects but the thoughts/feelings of the main characters.The ending was completely destroyed. The writers/director/producer should have stuck closer to the original story and this would have been a much better movie: a classic.C'est la vie.
1,Come on!,"This has to be the stupidist movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible besides Catherine Zeta Jones( she is excellent). But I mean the other girl in there was so dull, 1 word comes to mind when I think about this movie LIFELESS. Cant these producers waste 10 million on a movie that will be eerie or scary, because in my opinion this was just horrible."
4,Better than the original,"Don't form an opinion against it merely because Hollywood tells you that you shouldn't like it. At least in this remake, there's a believable reason for the house to be haunted instead of ""just because"" as it was with the original. This was scary when I first watched it and there was enough suspense without gore. Granted, it isn't as scary the second time around, but I've enjoyed it enough to watch it again and again."
3,The Haunting is so scary!!! just kidding!,"This movie was o.k. The first time I saw it at the movie theater,It was scary. I couldn't believe a pg-13 movie could actually be scary. But this movie had me going from the beginning to the end. it had cool special effects.(my favorite part) And Owen Wilson was my favorite character. He made it funny. Overall, I say this movie was good but the script and plot could have been a little better."
1,Boredom personified!,"This movie, supposedly a journey into terror, lulls one off to sleep most of the time. The pace is so slow that I thought the exposition would never end. There wasn't one fear producing moment in the entire movie. I believe ""Bambi"" was scarier.This movie is dreadful, especially when one remembers the 1963 version with Julie Harris. I wonder how much money was spent making this dud!"
1,Terrible,To sum up this movie takes one word and one word only...Terrible. If this is your first foray into The Haunting stop now and go back 36 years to the original.
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was absolutly stupid, boring, and a time-waster. The movie seemed to take forever and I couldn't wait for it to end. Plus, the ending was absolutely terrible and stupid. The main character in the story was such a bizzare character you really couldn't relate to her at all. The other characters were pretty weird too, but they were just funny. The special effects were OK, but it really annoyed me that those stupid statues kept coming to life to make the movie go on and on. There were so many many comedy aspects of this movie that it was hard to tell sometimes whether it was a comedy or a horror movie(such as the fact that all the characters had problems that were very obvious). I don't know about the old version of this movie, but the new one really sucks."
1,A waste of valuable money!,"I saw a commercial for this movie. The special effects looked great. I was expecting to see a great action-packed movie. A friend and I anxiously stepped into the theater. The movie started with a little action, but then it was gone. Nothing. That was it. I actually fell asleep during it, something I never did before! This was one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen in my life. It doesn't even deserve one star, but I've got to give it something. If you think that this looks like a good deal, think again. Your money is worth something much better for the same price."
2,not bad!,"My review is very simple: not bad, you can watch this movie but you might find it boring a bit.I dont recommend this to people who enjoy movies that have a good story and directing."
2,Sadly Disappointing,"This overdone remake of the brilliant 1963 classic is sorely disappointing. If it had been released as an original movie with an original title, it would have worked. The special effects (though good) were too much for this movie to bare."
1,Please!,"This was a horride movie. It had some creepy sceans, but the story was flater than paper. This proves that a movie doesn't need special effects to be scary. I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" and that was much better (And more scary) than this movie. Don't waste your money."
2,A BAD VERSION OF THE HAUNTING!!!,This was a bad remake of a really original SCARY movie. This remake focuses on the children trapped in the house. The original movie focused on the house and how scary and evil it was. That was what made it scary. The Haunting remake has ok special effects but some were not needed. Whoever reads this review I don't really recommend this movie but if you want to waste a couple of bucks go ahead.
3,If You've Read the Book This is an Adaptation of...,"This movie is (somewhat) based on the Shirley Jackson horror story The Haunting of Hill House. If you've read and loved that novel, you need to skip watching this movie. Jackson was able to scare readers with very few words. She didn't rely on tricks.I loved that book. This movie is an OK spooky film, but it doesn't come close to Jackson's work."
2,"It may be a modern-day classic to some, but not to me...","This 1999 horror film based on the original ""The Haunting"", is creepy in some ways, but altogether, it's not really a great film at all. It has good acting, and the scares and pop-outs are clever (things that boost my rating from a 1 to a 2), with an ending that isn't perfect, but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart. The film moves slow in the beginning, and it starts to pick the pace soon after, and later has it's intense ending. The film is OK in some ways, but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win, but it still isn't horrible. I liked the house and the setting, though. That was cool. The complete storyline was pretty good, also. If you want some innovative horror from 1999, I suggest you get ""The Blair Witch Project""."
4,Good movie!,"I think this is the type of movie that you have to watch at night in order to be scared. I wouldn't call it a horror film, but I wouldn't call it a thriller either. It's just one of those films that scares you. I thought Liam Neeson was great in this movie, the way he cared for Nell. I thought Owen Wilson did pretty good, Catherine Zeta jones character was a little strange, but still a good character to put in. But Nell played by Lili Taylor was great! She had a stunning performace! Now the mansion was simply amazing. I know it was probably just sets but it looked very awesome! Every room was extremely awesome! The sets were the best part of the movie!Acting: 4/5Location: 5/5Music: 4/5Story: 4/5Very good movie!"
3,EH,"Laughable special effects, but Lili Taylor is super-great and who can down a film where CZJ plays a hot bisexual? Something fun to watch while drinking cheap liquor and eating Cheetos."
4,Very interesting and suspenceful,"I found this movie to be a good scary movie to watch, and im sure all will enjoy the suspence and horror of this movie,it is worth watching and I hope all have fun with it..."
1,horribly......stupid,"Liam Neeson is pathetic. Catherine Zeta-Jones is sham. The young boy is boring, though i gave him a pity because he's killed for no reason. The only thing i was moved by is the girl and her story, her family story; in fact, the story itself is pretty interesting, so there's huge disappointment's waiting for you. Except computer effect there's almost nothing."
3,The acting was great...,"The acting was really great, but some aspects of the storyline were a bit choppy. The scenery was magnificent, but some of the special effects were not the best.It was an interesting combination of elements, actually. Some of it was pretty scary, and the superb acting made it altogether pretty palatable, despite some awkwardness in the plot.I never did fully understand HOW the character in trouble here got to be in this situation.. it seemed as though some vital scenes must have been cut out of the movie.Zeta-Jones was really great, and I'm glad I saw the movie if only for her character. She was just so darned likeable and funny!If you really like ghost stories, then you'll probably like this one. It reminded me of the older ""scary"" movies that I grew up with ... more tense moments and ghostly happenings than gore."
3,A nice attempt.,"The haunting is one of the most visualy pleasing movies that I have ever seen.( thus, it gets 3 stars, not 2). The plot is [messed up]. i wish that the producers would have [forgotten] the PG-13 rating and killed off a couple more of the insomniacs. Good SPFX and AWESOME scenery. rent it today.The HauntingRated: PG-13 for strong horror sequences and mild language.three stars!"
3,Decent,"The Haunting was an odd movie. The special effects were amazing. And much to my surprise, it was actually scary. I think it may be the first time in my adult life I ever screamed while watching a movie (much more from surprise than fear). But the script was definitely lacking. I came close to pitying Nell, the main character, but really felt a lack of empathy for the characters overall- Rather than being shocked if something was about to happen to one of them, I was more anxious to see what special effects would be used. There were also serious holes in the plot. This is a good movie if you just want to relax and have fun, but don't expect a moving experience."
3,Unique!,"Story of a Catholic teen sent to spend the summer with his Baptist cousins, who try to convert him. He defends his Catholic faith from the Bible. Preachy, but interesting! It was a great premise; too bad the author was such an amateur. The first half of the book was almost painful to read due to the author's breaking every rule of fiction writing known to man. OK, maybe I'm being a bit harsh . . . but I did have to FORCE myself to keep reading. Eventually it stopped bothering me so much. (Or maybe he got better as he went along.)Anyway, I found the Catholic apologetics most fascinating. Much of it I knew and agreed with, but I had never understood why Catholics consider Peter to be the first Pope. (Shows how ignorant we non-Catholics are, even those of us sympathetic to Catholic beliefs!)"
4,Ian Barnett,"I think that ""A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court"" was a entertaining and educational book. The book is about a boy named Michael who moves to Kentucky after his father dies. In Kentucky he is astounded to see so many fundamentalists, where in Philadelphia he had seen so many Catholics like himself. While living in Kentucky, Michael learns many things about the Fundamentalist Christians, as well as his own religion, Catholicism. His Uncle continually challenges Michael about his religion and tries to convert him to a Fundamentalist. This book was very interesting and worth the while. This was one of the best apologetics novels I've ever read."
3,I liked it but it wasn't all that great,The book was interesting if you do not know anything about Catholic apologetics. You can learn alot about the faith from this book. It is a good examlpe of what Fundamentalists believ and of how apologists defend the faith. There were some unrealistic things about thbook such as that Mike went from not knowing a lot to knowing evrything and defending his faith in about 4 weeks. Overall it was a good book and i suggest that you read it if you want to know more about or are interested in becoming an apologist.
3,STUDENT IN MR. PUNTELS RELIGION CLASS,"""A Phildelphia Catholic in Kings James's Court"" tells the story of a Catholic teenager who finds himself living among strict ""scripture only"" Fundamentalists. This book is packed with Catholic response to Fundamentalist ideas. It is easy to read and insightful all at the same time. Anyone who wants to learn more about Catholic vs. Fundatmentalist beliefs should start here."
4,Catholic H.S. religion class reads book,My students were enlightened and interested in the main character's encounters with Biblical Fundamentalist's approach to scripture. The students learned important apologetic information about Catholicism.
3,PCIKJC review,"This novel is about a boy named Michael who clashes with Fundamentalist Christians over matters about the papacy, Mary, and the Eucharist, while trying to understand his own faith better. I think the novel did a good job in explaining why Catholics believe what they do. I learned some things about why Catholics have the beliefs they do. One problem I found with the book was that the beginning was very dull and boring, and did not draw my attention. It started to become a little more interesting with the Bible discussions, but it was still boring overall. I found it hard to relate to them living on a farm. Overall, I think it is a gook book to read if you want to find more about the Catholic faith, but not if you want a book that you cannot put down."
4,A Philadelphia Catholic,"After reading ""A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court"", it was a lot better of a book than I thought it would be before I bought it. It was exciting to read in a way, because the story line was very realistic. It seemed almost like the author was telling it about himself. A negative aspect I had in reading this was that it seemed almost impossible for Michael, the ""Philadelphia Catholic"" to read and comprehend all of the information of the Bible, and be able to explain it in such a short amount of time. This did not seem to be a major fault in the book, and most would probably overlook it anyway. This book gave me an outlook on other peoples view of the Bible and their lifestyles. This was a great book, and I recommend reading it if it is for a class, or just on your own time."
4,Lasalle student's book review,"I enjoyed this book very much, to my suprise. When my teacher assigned this book, I thought that I would be bored throughout of the whole book. I did not think that i would be to interested in a book about church and Fundamentalism, but as I got into the book I really started to enjoy it. I thought that it was a very good reading experience for me. As i got deeper and deeper into the book, it just started getting better and better. All of the information about Catholic religion and why mary and peter are respected in the church astonished me. This book gave me a great experience in learning things about my Catholic faith that i never thought i would learn. I am glad my teacher gave me this assignment."
3,well expressed book about Catholic and Fundamentalist views,I am a Catholic myself and I could really see how Michael presented himself as a Catholic when faced against Fundamentalist's and their views. The book gives a good representation of how two beliefs can come into conflict and give a different perspective to the way people view other beliefs and their own.
4,Stephen Dwyer,A PHILLY CATHOLIC IN KING JAMES COURT was an excellent book abou the catholic faith. It taught me that Mary was important and that the bread we eat at church is really Jesus. It also taught me how the amish culture in Kentucky was like. The part I didn't like though was that Michael learned the whole Catholic faith in just a couple of weeks. When it actually takes years of study to learn all those tihngs. Other than it was agood book and educational.
4,Student in Mr. Puntel's Religion class,"I felt this book was very interesting and it gave me a lot more knowledge about Catholicism. Most kids Michael's age would not have shown such an interest for their religion, so it was a little hard to believe. For the most part it was a very good book and gave many important facts."
3,What to expect in this novel,"Although this book was not very exciting in my opinion, it gave me some new insights on Fundamentalist and Catholic views of the Bible. There is some background information in the story about the Bible and its meaning. It explains passages from certain sections in the Bible and gives some understanding to the time when it was written. I also learned about Fundamentalists and their view of Biblical interpretation. If you decide to purchase this book, I recommend that you pay close attention to how the Fundamentalists sometimes contradict themselves, and also how Michael (the main character) approaches the scripture. This book is great if you are interested in learning about the Catholic or Protestant religions, or want to know what certain sections of the Bible mean."
2,APCIKJC by White,"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a Catholic vs. Fundamentalist Christians story. Michael, the main character who went from Philadelphia to Kentucky, defended Catholic views and procedures. He tried to explain new ideas to the Fundamentalist, but they where not open to these ideas. I personally felt it became better towards the end of the novel. At first it was slow-moving and hard to keep track of all the characters. The description became hackneyed, along with the plot. Also, reading about the farm life was hard to relate to. After the heated bible discussions began, the story was easier to read. Overall, this book was better than I had expected."
1,PCKJC Review by Kelvin Lam,"This novel shows the struggle of a young boy troubled by his own faith, with problems within his own family from his father's death, to his uncle's fighting against his faith. It shows his struggle to find out what Catholicism is, the flaws of it, and which religion he should follow. It shows the heresies against Catholicism, along with its strengths. It has a sheer lacking in the amount of entertainment in the book, yet it can either strengthen or weaken your faith. It is tends to be utterly dull at times. Not a good book."
4,Religion Review - LSCHS Student,"After reading A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court by Martin DePorres Kennedy, it got me to thinking more about the religion I practice, Catholicism. As the book starts out, Michael, having just tragically losing his father, is thrown into a world; it would seem he is not ready for. As he gets to know his Uncle Les's fundamentalist view of the bible, he begins to realize not everything they practice does follow the bible. He begins to see arguments arise and he himself is challenged on the ways of the bible. The most significant change seemed to be his debate with Pastor Brown. Though Michael had seemed cornered he slipped out of harms way once again. In my opinion, this book gives an excellent overview of the issues that people have disagreed on and also why there was a split within the church. Overall, the book may have seemed boring to some, but the depth of knowledge it provided made me get a deeper understanding of what we really practice at mass."
3,Freshman Highschool Student,I found a Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court to be a very insightful book. This book talks about the struggles a boy undergoes when he is confronted by his uncle who just so happens to be a Biblical Fundamentalist. His uncle tries to show the boy that being a Biblical Fundamentalist is the proper way to worship and that he should join him as a Fundamentalist at his church. This book is a great book to read if you are trying to find your faith as a Catholic.
4,Never Judge A Book By Its Cover,"First I have to say is that what I got out of this book is not what I expected. Having been envolved in Religious debates, I can relate to nervousness that Michael experienced. Being a Catholic and having questions about my own faith, I found that this book has given me the ability to look into the Bible and find the answers to my questions."
4,Mr. Puntels Class,"The Book a Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was a good Novel. The Book had a good story and premise. Based in Kentucky it talked a lot about the Aimish and farm life. The only thing that was remotely bad about the book was some unrealistic events. Overal it was a good book. The book looked and was boring at first but as the plot and storyline started to develop it got a lot better. If any one was wondering about or having doubts of the Roman Catholic faith, I definitely recommend it."
3,Informative but plot is not interesting,"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court is about a boy named Michael, who after his father dies goes to live with family in Kentucky for the summer. There he struggled to keep his identity as a Catholic from all of the ensuing remarks of the Bible Fundamentalists. Looking through an entertainment perspective this book was rather bland and boring, but through information obtained from this book it was a very helpful text for all Catholics especially for those trying to find their identity."
4,The Catholic aproach against Fundamentalist views,"Although unrealistic at times, this book still got accross the Catholic aproach of some major misunderstood topics. The book also presented how and why fundamentalists contradict the Catholic view of these topics. After facing a devastating situation early in the book, Michael overcomes it and defends the Catholic faith against fundamentalists and their interpretation using good apologetic arguments mainly from the Bible. Overall, I thought this book was very interesting although it had many unrealistic parts. This is a good book for people who want to know about the Catholic faith. It shows different aspects of Catholiscism in a well written fictional story."
3,It Was Just Ok,A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's was ok. it was very descriptive and shows how faith is so important in your life. i only give it three stars because in some parts it isn't too realistic. i pretty much enjoyed it. and if you read it some parts will stick out i your head and you will remember them very cleary. for example i took an open book test without the book and i got a 90(they were pretty hard questions too) so it is a pretty good book over all.
3,LSCHS PCKJC BOOK REVIEW,"A Philadelphia Catholic In King Jame's Court was a pretty good book. IF someone told me what it was about i would never have thought i would like it, but it turned out not to be too bad. It had a lot of good information about the Catholic faith for people who aren't sure why we belieave the things we do like the papacy and our great respect and worship to Mary, the mother of Jesus. The reason why it was just pretty good is because there was nothing exciting that made me want to keep reading. It was overall a good book, but it didnt have anything exciting for me."
5,Genuinely worthy of five stars,"I have had this book on my shelf for quite a while, and finally got around to reading it after watching a documentary on Columbus on the Discivery Channel. I got inspired to overcome my intellectual laziness, and how pleased I am I did! This book really deserves its reputation as a timeless classic, and the author, a giant of maritime history, did such a fine job that I now want to read his well known biography of John Paul Jones. The text is gripping and the author's insights abound. This is a fine book."
4,"A colorful narrative, rich in detail.","This book is the definitive work on Columbus. Morison is famous for making the same journey that Columbus made with largely the same equipment in order to prepare for writing this book. His experience shines through in the detail thatMorison lavishes on his subject.As is the case with any great biography, Morison has become enamored with his subject, highlighting his strengths and successes while downplaying his weaknesses and failures, but you know that going into any biography and can adjust your interpretation accordingly.The story here is told very well, keeping the reader engaged and turning pages. Additionally, the book dispells many of the myths and common misconceptions about Columbus and really fills in a complete picure of the man.Well worth reading for any fan of history or biography."
4,Exhaustive and lengthy,"Well researched and written tome on Christopher Columbus. It is thorough to the point of excessive and gets to be slow a points but the information included is well presented. The obvious pro Columbus bias is present, but the reader understands this in advance and can adjust as necessary. The research done included the actual sailing of similar ships along the most possible route Columbus took. Another negative during this time is the nautical jargon used by the author which is hard to understand. Morison writes with the understanding that any reader interested in Columbus will identify with the technical verbiage, but he does attempt to simplify the terms without being condescending. Despite these minor bumps in the road, this book is well worth the time to understand Columbus and the rediscovery of America."
2,Misleading entities...,"While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with ""questionable"" character traits. Bartolome De Las Casas, a European minister who lived in the same time as Colombus, gives a much more realistcally bleek look at the Spanish invasion of the Americas. Because Morison's focus shifts so rapidly from the bad to the good, it loses major points for realism. The book reads more like a 3rd grade textbook; Morison would have us believe Santa Claus and the toothfairy exists along side a saintly Christopher Columbus."
5,Great Piedmont Blues,This is a great dvd if you like acoustic blues. The camera work is great and the tunes are classic.
5,best group ever!,"Take a travel through your mind, body and soul as you listen to any of the albums by the Art Ensemble of Chicago. I highly recomend that you not only check Urban Bushmen out, but as well as all the other albums. I love the music because I can hear all the love and power behind the music that the Art Ensemble of Chicago creates. It's a definate must in everyones cd collection."
5,A Romance of a Different sort.,"Excellent reading! This was my introduction to George MacDonald's books. Not a soppy romance as today's authors tend to write, but even one that men would enjoy reading for leisure! As I am a GREAT fan of C.S.Lewis' and Tolkien's writings, I was fascinated to find that both these author's drew a lot of their inspiration from MacDonald's writings. I have since read ""The Princess & the Goblin"", ""The Princess & Curdie"", ""The Golden Key"", and ""The Light Princess"". My husband is currently reading Phantastes and we have also bought Lilith, still to be read. I look forward to getting ""The Marquis' Secret"" if I can, as I really would like to follow the full story!!"
2,Not very useful,"As far as I know, this is the first book on SQLite and for that Chris Newman deserves a compliment.Beyond that, this book is not very useful though:1) It explains some basic SQL syntax but I didn't buy this book to learn SQL.2) Very little information about the specifics and pitfalls of SQLite syntax, I rarely find what I'm looking for.3) Being a PHP developer I don't need the chapters on C++, Perl, TCL and Python (about 25% of the book)."
3,SQL Lite,"SQLite is not intended to be a complete replacement to standard Database Management Systems. It IS, however, a good alternative to a full-blown database in some situations. Think of it as a simple database management system with NO RELATIONS - this may or may not be a problem for you and your project.I would never use SQLite for a web site of any complexity - MySQL and other RDBMS's are simply too plentiful, powerful and easy to use. One great application I've found is to use SQLite in, say, a C++ application such as a game for saving information like player stats and scores. This saves you from having to do file i/o and parsing through text files. In such a situation, talking to an independent database server would cut the player off from the data if he was offline or otherwise not able to communicate with the server."
5,I LOVE this CD!,It's got all of the great skating prorams AND its' the full piece of music. It's not some lame edited version. Love it!
5,THE MUTHALOAD,"If you have a house full of sh*tkickers, and your beer is disappearing from the fridge, and they're starting to make bathtub gin in the outhouse, and your next door neighbor is with the County Sheriff's Department, don't put this CD on the stereo. You'll never get 'em to leave. And granny will tan your hide in the woodshed with a switch.Hmmmm... ON SECOND THOUGHT, TURN THIS UP REAL LOUD, SO'S THE NEIGHBORS WILL COMPLAIN, YA'LL.THIS IS HILLBILLY GRUNGE AT IT'S FINEST."
5,Likable music that you enjoy as much as the kids do!,"We bought this disc after seeing Ralph Covert open for the kid's band ""Hi-5"". The kids love these songs. The adults in the house love the ""Big Rig"" song and the ""Coffee"" song just as much as the kids do. I can respect a song that hits that close to home: ""and tonight I think I'll have a little vino"".Buy this disc for your kids, but you can enjoy it, too."
5,Soon to be your kid's favorite,"As a Chicagoan, I am so proud to boast about Ralph's World. These songs are witty, catchy and have great messages. My one year old daughter just loves listening to them in the car. When Tra La La comes on, she starts singing ""la la la."" My husband cracks up at the song about the eighteen wheeler every time. The only track we don't like it is Harry's Haunted Halloween Circus, but it is easily skipped."
5,Positively WONDERFUL!,"My son is 4 and just absolutely LOVES the songs on Ralph's World At the Bottom of the Sea. He sings the songs all through out the day. His favorites include: The Banana Splits, Surfin in my Imagination, and Eighteen Wheel on a Big Rig, as well as the Coffee Song. Great album and not one that grates on parental nerves either. I enjoy the songs just as much as my son does. Two thumbs up!"
5,Excellent CD!,"What a fantastic cd! Our whole family enjoys it and actually sings along when it's on. Our 1 year old even sings along to the Bean Soup and Rice song ~ he loves it! We bought it after owning Happy Lemons, which is another very ""happy"" cd....I really hope he makes more."
5,Our all-time favorite CD...,"I'm amazed we haven't worn the darn thing out. Our three-year-old loves this CD (better than the first, haven't yet heard the third!) and we ended up buying one for each car, and one for all our friends...guess I shoulda bought 'em in bulk! I disagree with the reviewer who said this is for 4 years and up--Laura's loved Ralph since she was six months old."
1,I'd like to see Ralph at the bottom of the sea,"Covert writes a bunch of non-sensical, sophomoric songs that my kids simply hate. This guy is a Barney-wannabe and this album does nothing to save his dignity."
2,"like the doll, but that's it","Although the doll is great (like all Barbie - Kellie dolls) the jumpin castle was pretty much a waste of money. We really didn't get it to work right and, in the long run, my daughter just played with the doll. Unless you are buying it for the doll, I wouldn't recommend this one, just a waste of plastic here."
4,Depression Management,"This is an excellent audio tape that explains what clinical depression is. It is a good starting point to help a person recognize what they are feeling. The side on anxiety management is for heavy problems. It might have been better to make two different tapes, but I still would highly recommend it.I've given this tape to people who are obviously hurting. It is a way to help someone help themselves. It is easier to comprehend than reading a book on depression. Plus, it gives you a way to help when you see someone in pain."
5,Excellent follow up to Big Game Hunter,"I played Cabela's Big game hunter ultimate challenge, and enjoyed it very much. I immediately bought this as soon as it came out. The graphics are even better than Big game hunter, there are tracks behind the vehicles, everything has shadows, and the hunter even leaves footprints behind. The new 'deer finder' arrow is a very cool new feature and gives the game a more arcadey feel. The mission based play of this game is very cool, and the range of levels and deer are just right. The models for the hunters are improved also. Lots of great gadgets and hunting gear are available to the player including a 'predator' style heat vision and a night vision scope ! All in all a lot of fun. A little easiser than BGH but BGH was kinda hard. You can change the difficulty to suit yourself. I am so glad that activision are supporting the genre on consoles !"
3,mis-information,"I purchased this game under the assumption it was a 1 or 2 player game according to the info proveded. When I received the game, it is a 1 player game only so beware of this."
4,A Critical Introduction to the GB Theory,"Since Chomsky established the GB model in the early 1980's, many introductory books have been published. Culicover's book came out by the end of the GB fashion when most people were attracted by Chomsky's new ideas of the minimalist program (MP). However, this book is not out of date at all, since Culicover illustrated the GB theory in a very critical way providing with quite a number of problems which cannot be solved at ease within the GB framework. All those problems are interesting issues that generative syntax has to manage. Though the author gave some suggestions, the issues remained open both to the GB framework and the MP followers. After reading this book, you may realize that the GB model is not as good as most people believe and that the burden of the MP will be heavier when it has to take over what left insolvable in the GB."
2,too small for a newborn,I ordered this bag without any knowledge of how big it was. I wanted to use it for a wkend trip I was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was. I have a 3 month old baby girl and it was way too small for me to carry all of her things in it. I was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items. I wasn't even able to fit a change of clothes. I tried putting a change of her clothes in the back pocket but it made it way too bulky. All in all the bag was adorable but way too small for a newborn. I wouldn't recommend this bag to any mother with a newborn baby.
3,Not the best diaper bag,"My first diaper bag was the Pooh bag by ""Dolly"". It looks cute, but the exterior is difficult to clean. Also the interior vinyl/pvc lining can tear after light useage.In sum, this bag was not so great. If you want a very simple bag, and do not have high expections, then this bag will fill that need. This bag is okay and somewhat durable if you don't mind interior tears.When my second baby was born, I prefered using the free diaper bag I got at the hospital, rather than the ""Dolly"" Pooh bag. The free hospital bag had more features/ pockets by far than this simple sack."
2,First Part,"I just bought this book 5 days ago. I test in 17 days. SO that gives me at the most if I started studying when I bought this book about 22 days total. I will give you an update on how I did. So far I've read everything in the book, but aside from the practice tests, I don't really care too much because it doesn't actually go through and help you with more difficult problems. I've taken the asvab before, but for the job I want I need to score a little higher to be a linguist in the general section. I'm just studying my VE & Arithmetic since those are the only two that matter. I'll give you a future update."
5,Excellent Service,"The book was in excellent condition you can't even tell that it's been used. Also, it came very fast. Excellent Service and reliability! I would definantely purchase from this person again in the future!"
2,not what people think,"this book is very mediocre, it has very little correct information. the practice test especially the math parts have a lot of questions that are irrelevant when taking the actual test none of the questions you have practiced for math is on the actual test. the info about the time and amount of questions in the test are correct but be warned. Im sure there are better ways to improve your math skills. don't waste your money."
4,Good Book!,"This is a very good book! My sister and I used it to study for the ASVAB. Don't worry too much about the test, look over this book and relax during the test!"
4,positive,cd is a nice addition to help with test taking . The book goes into good detail of the types of questions and does provide the answers and why
2,Missing pages.,Contents references pages up to 375. Book stop at page 342. Three chapters are missing. Good book up until the missing chapters.
2,yes and no,"I bought this book for my son as he wanted to study for ASVAB test and when I was helping him study by reading him the test there were many many answers incorrect in the back of the book. When checking to see if an answer was incorrect or correct there were lots of mistakes. I was aware of some of the answers and knew they were wrong, but if a person was in the dark about what the answer would be they would go on the incorrect answer. So, this is not a book I would recommend for studying."
5,Great stuff,I really like this book. It helps me to refresh my mind in a lot of stuff I had forgot! Good book.
5,VERY HELPFUL,"THIS BOOK WILL HELP PREPARE YOU FOR THE MILITARY ASVAB TESTS. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AND IT WAS HELPFUL TO MY TEENAGE BOYS,"
2,Incredibly Lackluster,"I am sorely disappointed by this book.I don't know what the other reviewer was doing when he actually read through this book but I found countless, and I mean a SUBSTANTIAL number, of incorrect answers in this books prep tests. The amount of factual errors, typos and flat out incorrect information contained in this book makes me wonder if it really was written by a ""Dummie"". On top of this everything contained inside the book is stuff you would have learned in the first year of high school if you paid any attention what so ever to your classes.To top this off and prove how serious I am about informing you guys/gals not to even contemplate putting your money forth to purchase this book -- I made an account on Amazon.com solely so I could express my distress at this poorly written piece of literature."
2,Few Errors,"If you read a ""Dummies"" book before then you know the format. The first part of the book is divided into lessons, then there are three sample tests in the back.I thought the lessons were good, but not great compared to some of the other ASVAB books out there. The book did a great job of telling you upcoming changes to the ASVAB as advertised.What really turned me off from this book was when I was doing the sample tests and there were a couple answers that were clearly wrong. For instance, the question for General Science was what Chromosomes does a female have. The answers in the back said ""XY"" while it should have been ""XX"". This was just one of a few I found.While the style remains the same as most dummies books, I cant recommend this to anyone based on the errors in the sample tests. If you dont plan on doing sample tests then this book might be for you."
1,incorrect practice test answers,"I mean seriously, I paid good money for this book and the practice test answers are wrong. I don't recommend buying this and am going to try and get my money back."
5,This book helped me get a good grade,This book helped me achieve a 95E-95M-80G-80A. Electrical and Mechanical were part of my background so I can not attribute all knowledge gained to this book. I am now a 2W151 at Nellis AFB and am glad to be in the USAF
4,Good study book,Got this for my kids to look through and prepare for their ASVAB. Checked this out for myself and found it easy to understand. If I would of had this back when I took the ASVAB I would have scored even better than my 82. I would recommend this for any student looking towards a future in the Military.
3,Good so far,I would recommend anyone wanting to brush on studying for the ASVAB for this book. Got here in time. Lent it to a friend and they didnt complain.
5,Awesome Reviewer,"This book is easy reading. My daughter used this to review for her ASVAB exams - and yes, she passed with flying colors. Hightly recommended."
4,Recommended read,The Army Recruiter recommends this book for people getting ready to take the ASVAB test. It is easy to read and my son has been studying it without being told.
5,Better than the higher rated ARCO one,"I was pleasantly surprised because I had begun studying from the ARCO textbook, and I noticed that the explanations for arithmetic problems were not always the easiest to understand. Dummies gave me a thorough explanation for each problem, and its vocab section seemed to have more difficult words, which prompted me to study up on that section. Vocab was the least of my concerns until I saw the words in the practice exams in THIS book as opposed to the ARCO one, and luckily, I saw some of the same words on the actual ASVAB. I didn't study the other portions of the textbook, such as autoshop, and electrical, because my focus was the General Technical score, but as far as arithmetic and verbal, this was very helpful."
1,FULL OF MISTAKES!!!!,"This book is great for people whom already have well developed, basic math skills and are just looking for a refresher to familiarize them with what they might run across on the ASVAB. You need to already have good math skills because the math, science, electronics, and physics portions of this book are FILLED with basic, arithmetic errors (elementary school level addition and subtraction and middle school level factoring). Don't expect to learn anything from this book. If you need to brush up on math for the ASVAB, I would suggest a different publisher."
3,It's worth it!!!,The book is in good conditions. I would recommend because it's really good and it explains everything so easy to understand!!!
5,A Very Sweet Story,"This tale is sweet and heartwarming, but be forewarned that it is VERY short. I read it in only a couple minutes. It is bittersweet and touching, not a ""happy ending"" story, but worthwhile reading."
4,Recommended by Mark Twain in his Autobiography,"Twain, Mrs. Clemens and John Brown were dear friends. Twain speaks of him constantly in his autobiography. I bought this story - it is much too brief to call it a book - on his recommendation. The story of Allie's surgery is amazing. Her courage, as depicted, at undergoing such an ordeal is awe-inspiring. His description of the wild young men of his youth is generously and wisely written. The whole tale may take you only twenty minutes to read, but Allie and John Brown will make an impreession, for sure."
3,Not a bad start!,"You have to listen to this album at least a few times. There are a few really good tracks. The first half of the album wasproduced by Les Karskey, so it's not as interesting as the lasthalf. I guess they got fed up, so they did the rest by themselves. I really liked ""I mistake myself"", for the guitarwork. It get's close to what they we're doing when they got toHee Haw. ""The Voice"", has a lot of energy, and insight. ""Shivers"", well, everyone likes that song. This album is a good start. I still think it's better than some ofthe indie music out today. And if you are a Birthday Party fan,it is a must to have. Get it cheap, though."
3,Not the best album ever...,"I bought this LP on the basis that it was the first put out by Nick Cave and what would become the Birthday Party. I was a little disappointed - people looking for music of the same sort as found on the Bad Seeds albums will be sorely disappointed, I'm afraid. That said, ""Shivers"" is probably the best song I've heard in years. Buy with caution."
3,"40 years later, still love this song","One of the first LP's I owned was ""The Mason Williams Phonograph Record."" When I noticed this update I had to give it a try, I still like ""Classical Gas"" and the electric versions of some of his other guitar classics. Nice backround music but I still prefer the Rolling Stones 40 years later!"
4,"Interesting, fun and enjoyable.","I discovered this album while exploring music by Mannheim Steamroller and bought it because I am a fan of Mason Williams' ""Classical Gas."" An energetic electronic update to the original acoustic is the first performance on the album, and in my opinion ""Classical Gas 2005"" is every bit as interesting and fun as the original. The remainder of the album varies from hauntingly beautiful (Riding the Low Moon), to epic (The Last Crusade), to western-like (Eddie I'm Ready), to just plain electronic fun (Doot-Doot). The music on this album is too interesting to fade into the background. I find myself being called to stop and listen to its magic. Mason Williams and guitarist Zoe McCulloch make a great team. I'm impressed and pleased with my purchase."
1,aim low,"Although there are good poems in here, and good authors, Astley is intent on dumbing down poetry - this book aims for the lowest common denominator possible, and then digs deeper. Astley's commentary and rants are opinionated and condescending. Poetry is far more alive and interesting than than this anthology suggests."
4,Low budget but good fun,"""The Case of the Cunningham Heritage"" is the ONLY time the legendary first meeting of Holmes and Watson has been put on film, and ""The Red-Headed League"", ""Shoeless Engineer"" (""Engineer's Thumb"" made less gory) and ""The Pennsylvania Gun"" (""Valley of Fear"" without the boring flashback) are ALL based on Doyle. So wasn't ""The French Interpreter"" but that's not in this set. Ronald Howard played Holmes in a likeable way, while H. Marion Crawford was an excellent Watson, and both are closer to the ages Holmes and Watson really were when they first met. The prints could be cleaner, but they're better than what's turned up on local TV stations and come in a nice package. Let's hope they put out the remaining episodes to complete the series. Watch for Michael Gough in ""The Perfect Husband"" and Natalie Shafer in ""The Shy Ballerina""."
5,Beautiful Yoga DVD,"As Peggy Hall takes you through each exercise, you feel energized and at the same time more at peace with yourself. I have her other DVD's and really enjoy the pace of this one, especially if you want a bit of a challenge. Beautiful scenery too!"
5,love it,"I've been doing this (2) times a week, along with swimming a 1/2 mile at the public pool for the past 3 weeks and feel so good. This video really works your body in all the ways you need for strength and flexibility in surfing. I can't wait to get back in the ocean soon, when it gets a little warmer ! And take the power and flow of this yoga, to help me improve my surfing. Instead of working so hard to catch a wave and paddle out, at my age of 57:)"
1,Yoga for surfers taught by a Poser,I have never bother to write one of these review but I agree that the video is too advance for beginners and I find it difficult to get over the fact of what a poser she is. She seems to be cashing in on surfing and going after a niche market in yoga DVDs. I have watched and done all three DVDs and I have seen much better yoga DVDs. I sold these DVDs because they aren't the best out there. Check out the Living Art series of DVDs. I found these much better then the whole series of yoga for surfer. Go mindfully and slowly. Peace
4,Finally! A Travelogue About the Real Rome,"Paul Hofmann writes about his hometown the way any native would, with equal parts admiration and frustration. Sure, he describes the great trattorie, touches on the sordid histories of Rome's luxury hotels, and is continually mesmerized by the city's ancient ruins. But, anecdotes about such topics as the irregularity of the postman's visits, motorino pollution, municipal strikes, and lousy restaurant service, make the book come alive. Thank god this isn't another tired, old, tourist piece about how great it is to live abroad (""A Year in Provence,"" anyone?) Hofmann's grouping of chapters by month is also innovative and helpful to travelers who want to know what goes on in the city the REST of the year. The book tends to be a bit dull in some places, owing probably to the fact that Hofmann wrote this book in his 70s or 80s. He knows little about hip, modern Rome. Nevertheless, his ""diary"" makes for a good read and a good history lesson."
4,watch out for shipping costs,I love the pen again pen due to my carpel tunnel syndrome. Amazon charges shipping per package so I order from the seller direct to reduce shipping charges on my large orders. The refills don't last very long due to I write a lot and they are smaller than other refills in order to fit into the pens. Refills are the way to go as they reduce plastic consumption.
3,A store credit purchase...just another crinkle book,"We used a return credit to buy this for our infant. It's just a simple crinkle book that can be bought anywhere. He doesn't really seem interested in the teether portion, just the crinkle pages."
5,Good Buy,"The toy makes an appealing ""crinkle"" sound, and it's a little bit smaller than other similar books on the market -- so my 4-month old grandaughter can handle it a bit better. I was extremely pleased with this toy (as was the baby)!"
4,Worth the Cost,"I used to have an ATI TV PCI card, which is great for image captures, but gave me (and numerous other people I talked to) a headache for video capturing itself. The ADS USB Instant Video is a good deal for the price, and is excellent for good-quality video capturing (Excellent frame rate, just make sure other programs are off and the capturing isn't [messed] up at the start). Plenty of other excellent features, the software is a good-quality editing package. Compared to the ATI card though, capturing images is a bit annoying. Otherwise, it's worth it!Connections are very easy, and it's quite user-friendly and easy to learn, as I'm not a techie!"
1,ADS Instant Video,"You get audio signal onlt with no picture when you try to capture home movie from comcaorder tape. In very few case, I captured the video footage, but i just get the audio when you paly it back.When you sent the problem to ADS customer service, you get automatical e-mail response said they will respond to your questions ASAP. but, you never get e-mail unless you call them. the phone line is so busy, you wouldn't be so patient."
5,Haunting Deer,"Wheeler's Deer Wan is perhaps the best showcase for his dual talents of writing and playing. The melodies are stunning and Wheeler gives his sidemen ample room to stretch. He's assembled a Who's Who from the ECM stable: Richie Beirach, John Abercrombie, Ralph Towner & others. The rich orchestrations support the tunes with perfect touches throughout.The soloing on 3/4 in the Afternoon by Wheeler is itself worth the price of the CD. Wheeler's heartfelt take on the melody floats above his accompaniment, building a head of emotion as it reaches its final statement.Anything but 'wan!' Six stars!"
4,Not a Hollywood Expose,"Anyone who wants to know a little bit more about Beatrix Potter, the person, will be pleased with this book. Through real-life annecdotes John Heelis conveys what should be obvious but isn't - Beatrix Potter was not a perfect human being, she had tiny flaws just like the rest of us. Sometimes she got cranky, occasionally she was absent-minded with her head in the clouds but mostly she was wonderful - although quite strong willed and opinionated.Those who are fascinated by Beatrix Potter will find the little book a great addition to their library. However, be forewarned - those who are buying this book for a voyeristic look into the intimate details of Beatrix Potter's married life will be sorely disappointed. This very private woman's private life remains private."
4,Pedal to the metal,"At least that was what my previous pedal looked like, it was showing through to the metal. This beauty fit right over the metal and have not had one problem with it."
5,Good Product,"I bought this product earlier this year to replace my old OE foot pedal cover. The product replaced the OE with no problem. it was easy to put on the pedal. I would buy again , if needed."
4,Wedding Tie,This tie was purchased for a family member's wedding. It is exactly what the bride requested and is exactly as described. The seller also included cleaning instructions and was packaged very nicely.
5,'The Greatcoat' is the finest short story ever written,I have read 3 translations of this story and I like them all for different reasons. The story is very readable and has interesting interpretations on several levels. All the friends I recommended the story to loved it.
3,Mostly Satisfied,"The book was shipped to me very quickly and is in good condition; however, I would have liked to have known what other stories were included in the book ahead of time."
4,Definately worth knowing,"I actually read another collection of Gogol stories but I have read ""Diary of a Madman"", ""The Nose"", and ""The Overcoat"". The book is worth buying for Diary of a Madman or the Nose alone. These are both great stories that really show the uniqueness and talent of Gogol which seems even more amazing when thinking he was writing in the 19th Century. The Overcoat is a good story but the other two are classics and unbelieveable works of fantasy and social commentary that still seems relevant today."
3,A nice change of pace,"Modern American readers will probably find a lot of distance between themselves and Gogol, who writes with an observational comedy about the world he sees around him. But since the themes are timeless, his work will be pleasing, and often very funny, to most discerning readers."
3,Short stories from the Russian heartland.,"I am not as enamored of these Russian short stories as some of the other reviewers are. The last story about Bulba depicted Jews in a very demeaning way, and you can see the stereotypes of the Eastern European Jew written into a very interesting story.Gogol was one of the great Russian writers, but the inclusion of this shows him to be an anti-Semite. Otherwise the stories are interesting and humorous of the Tsarist times. The story of the Russian bureaucrat pretending to be Fernando VIII of Spain starts out this book and is by far the best. The others are silly stories, and the last one about Bulba shows the Polish occupation of the Ukraine in medieval times. The first and last stories are by far the best, if you can stomach the anti-Semite tone in the latter story.Overall, an interesting and slightly humorous read. This book gives you a picture of Russia in the times of the Tsar."
3,short takes,"As a student using this book as a text in class I find it most helpful and interesting. Not only does it vary in topic, but it also gives you insight on new methods of interesting writing. Antoher plus is the length of each story with makes for easy reading. It really does live up to its name short takes."
2,Disgusting garlic breath,"First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack? The onion and other vegetables are more than enough to provide flavour."
2,hummm,"A little too flowery for my taste and not very scientific. Then again what did I expect !!! Easy pros however if you want to learn about anatomy, get an anatomy atlas !!"
1,"Nope, nope","I cannot believe there are no negative reviews for this. No matter any point of view (feminists are gonna be mad) or theory this book is positing, the basis of the book is not understanding female anatomy. I have no idea if the psychological ideas have been debunked. This book was given to me as a joke a few birthdays ago. You can say ""the reason your sex is bad is because you've lost your feminine role"" and hell, that could be 100% correct, but a big chunk of this book ignores where the nerve endings are located. In the 40 years since this was published, I think someone went ahead and talked to some women, maybe even did some science-y stuff and decided 80+% of women weren't just orgasming wrong. But its good that this is still out there, to make people feel ashamed of the way their body works. In other news, no one poops but you: cause you're gross."
2,Only use if original pins are broken.,I ordered these to replace my worn pins on my truck. I'm CDO about my truck and I noticed a bit of play in the factory stock hinge on the driver door. As it turns out these are made with pretty generous clearances and my door now has more play than it did before installing these. My next step is to try McMaster-Car in hope they will have a tighter fitting bushing in the correct size for my door hinge.I gave them two stars because they do an adequate job of holding the door onto the truck.FYI: CDO is similar to OCD except the letters are in the correct order.Erik
3,Subpar,"The knurls were not large enough to create a tight fit with the inner hinge. I'm worried that the hinge will rotate on the pins instead of the pins rotating in the bushing, causing hinge wear and thus trashed hinges. A Possible remedy that I didn't think of during installation would be to beat around the inner hinge holes to shrink them down, facilitating a tight fit."
5,Great Book!,I really enjoy this book! I love the Japanese art work in it. It's one of my favorite coffee table books.
3,Not a terrible buy...,Bought this thinking it would give me a better look/understanding of the hardys and it somewhat delivered that. For the most part the interviews are in depth and great but they are old interviews and everything is dated. Not a the best buy i've ever made but not the worst either.
5,A pop standard,"This is another one of those CDs that you pop into the stereo and know within moments that it's one you will be listening to over and over again for a long time. It feels like a staple in my music collection by the second song.The production is high quality. The songs are thoughtful, emotional and well written. The voice matches the songs beautifully with power and feeling.This CD has it all: outstanding vocals, exceptional musicianship, intelligent lyrics and gives the listener an all around wonderful feeling.(read full review at collectedsounds.com)"
2,Not good quality,"This is a very cheap toy. Poor finish, sloppy tolerances. Had a slight imbalance and would vibrate and lose speed quickly. The vibration makes most of the usual gyroscope tricks impossible.Then it spun off the table and promptly broke. Perhaps that's why they offer the two-pack?"
4,Classic toy to impress your friends with science!,"This is a really fun toy. I had one as a kid growing up, and had to buy myself another one. This one seems a bit less durable than I remember, if you pull hard on the string, the inner wheel jumps out of it's holes. I am fairly confident that Gyroscope is no longer made by the same company that used to make it. But its very fun, and very interesting. You will need to oil it though, to keep it working properly. Just 2 drops of multi-purpose oil does the trick."
4,Gyro is a great gift,I've purchased several of these as gifts for children I mentor in the public school system. I like them because they are educational and durable and hopefully are an item the child will keep for a long time.
1,Do Not Buy,I know because I bought it. The gyroscope spins out of control and the string snaps on the first pull. The gyroscope is UGLY and DULL. I am Verry Disappointed and so will you if you get this. Do Not Buy it. It is made of lead and stains your finger when you toutch it. This Toy is Very Low Quality and it stinks. As I said Before Do not Buy.
2,zero durability,"the felt top is so thin, my dog tore into it instantly! Next came out the foam bed, which she shredded into a million pieces, then she got to the inner cedar beds. Well you can imagine the mess it made.this bed lasted her a whole week. I cannot find anything for her. If you have an older, mellow dog, this would be a great bed. It is quite comfortable. But if you have a pooch that likes to destroy, this won't hole up at all."
2,Rather plain,"Disappointed by this item. I bought a couple of ""crystal"" decanters at the same time, which cost only a few dollars more. The difference was striking. This set is very dull, ordinary glass, and the rubber stopper in the decanter looks cheap."
1,doesn't wash off that easily,We bought this thinking our kids would love it. They did love painting. But the problem came when we tried to wash it off. We cleaned it about 30 minutes after the kids started and we had to get out the pressure washer. It took about an hour to clean up. It was by far the worst clean up. It does not come off that easily. the regular hose did nothing to get it off.
4,Fun times,My daughter really enjoyed this. Paint doesn't last long. Washes off sidewalk and clothes fine. Would recommend for the kids to enjoy.
2,Not how I thought it would be,"The paint is very thin which makes it hard to paint on the sidewalk, you have to keep going over and over the same area to get it to stay and then I had a hard time getting it off when I left it overnight."
4,A Different Marx,"Erich Fromm, displays a different profile of Karl Marx. According to Fromm, Marx is very different than the one told by the Russian Communists. Fromm tries to show the humanist ideas of Marx and he describes Marx's philosophy as a synthesis of humanism and naturalism. There are also good descriptions of what socialism means: ""Socialism, for Marx, is a society which permits the actualization of man's essence, by overcoming his alienation."".Fromm describes the Marxist socialism as the heirs of propethic Messianism.This book is really interesting because Fromm tries to explain the humanistic values in socialism.Indeed, all the communist propaganda has claimed that their way is the real Marxist system; however Fromm claims that their system was just a crude communism which neglected human beings and humanistic values."
4,Deeply Satisfying Movie,"I chanced on this movie completely by accident. It was in the wrong box. It opened with some goats and French subtitles. I thought, oh boy, this will put me to sleep. Yet the movie works on many levels: on one, it is like a complex detective story, with tiny clues sprinkled throughout gradually coming together at an overwhelming ending. On one level, it is a comedy, poking fun at pompous scientists and ignorant folk. On another, it explores unrequited love, a topic the movies usually avoid. On another it about the lush scenery and quaint village life in France. Yves Montand is a brilliant actor. He packs so much depth into every second he is on screen. He feels like a real person. It is a movie about faces, memorable, complex, elderly, even ugly faces.This movie is the very opposite of fluff."
4,"5 for the 1st, 4 for the 2nd","While I loved both movies, Jean de Florette and the sequel Manon of the Spring, I would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second. They are both masterfully done, and you really can't watch just one of them, as they are an inseparable pair, the first movie forming the background for the second, and the second providing the resolution for the first. Without giving up too much of the story, these movies tell a story of greed, ""accidental"" murder, and resolution with the likes of Greek tragedy--critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart. Two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime. My only criticism of the 2nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman, which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision. Overall, this flaw can be overlooked, as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come."
4,The final chapter of Jean de Florette,"Originally titled ""Manon des sources"", this movie is the conclusion to the store ""Jean de Florette"". It is done in French dialogue & English subtitles.The camera captures the beauty of the French countryside in all its splendour in this movie.Jeans' daughter Manon, has grown up and taken over the family farm, following the tragedy which occurs in the first installment.She seeks to extract revenge on those who have harmed her family.There are some amazing revelations in the movie, which will leave you shocked.A truly wonderful movie, well acted, directed and filmed.It is important to watch the first installment (JdF), before viewing this movie."
3,Manon of the Spring - Korean version,"This together with Part I, Jean de Florette. is one of the greatest movies of all time. I am rating this version 3 stars instead of 5, because of some curious censorship in this version. The theatrical release has a brief nude scene of the exquisite Emmanuelle Beart. This scene is not only essential in revealing her beauty and innocent joy, it is essential to understand Ugolin's growing madness regarding her. In the Korean version, the nude scene is blocked out, as if we are looking through a translucent piece of glass. Very strange. Still, as the American version has inexplicably gone out of circultion, the Korean version is all that is available right now."
5,"Beautiful Movie, Great Deal Price!!!","Been looking for this DVD for years! I'm glad I finally found one at an affordable price!! I had read that in the Korean Edition, there was a scene in the movie that was blurred, when Manon is bathing, and wondered how important that would be to the movie, or my response to the story, and IT IS NOT. The scene where Manon is bathing is like 2 seconds, or less! Now, I have seen both versions and let me tell you that in the unedited version (US Edition) you still dont see much more so why pay 70 dollars for something that is not crucial and you can barely see when you can own the Korean version DVD for half the price?...So my advise is get the Korean DVD, save your money and get yourself another movie instead! Enjoy."
3,manon of the spring,"The movie is superb in story, acting and photography. BUT!!Korean recording treatment is substandard. Their DVD was fullof glitches including hesitations, stretching of the middlein the screen and near breakup of the picture."
5,Please re-release the DVD already!,"Needless to say, I love this movie (and Jean de Florette.) I would just like to say that if anyone has bought the rights to it (Criterion?), kindly release it already, since these movies have been out of print for years now. Available used from $90. Get outta here."
4,Good performances,"I bought this CD because it's one of the few complete recordings of the Suite In Modo Polonico. The sound quality is good, and the guitar tone is good as well. I thought the tempos of the Suite were a little fast, but otherwise, a nice CD reference of Tansman's work."
4,A whimsical and humorous adventure with memorable characters,"I read this book as a child, and recently succeeded in finding it again (having forgotten the title.) Good Luck Arizona Man is the story of a white boy raised by Apaches, trying to discover the secrets of his own past and heritage while keeping his Apache identity. He goes on a search for the lost gold of the Apaches, which is tied up with his own mystery. Unfortunately, the mountains are filled with bizarre and dangerous white men also searching for the gold: and the Apache chief has sent men to ensure that the prophesy (he who finds the gold must die) comes trueThe book is humorous and whimsical, with many surprising plot twists. I doubt that the portrait of Apache life and customs is very accurate, but the white men are equally ridiculous. In any case, the characters (and their names--Head Toter, Tied-Up, Miss Utter Delight, Fantail and Poop, Old Wickiup, Missing Toe) are hilarious and unforgettable."
1,Won't work in Dimage 7i,"Inserting this card in my new Minolta Dimage 7i (digital camera), I get an ""Unable to use card"" error. The card is evidently incompatible with the 7i. Others have had the same experience. See the digital camera forums.Check the compatibility chart at minoltausa.com before you buy!"
2,Wouldn't recommended,"This card worked great in my Canon G3 digital camera for few months, and the 'CF Card Error' started happending (as some of the other reviewers have also experienced). I reformatted the disk few times and I'm still getting that error when I turn on my camera. Since it has a life time warranty on it, I'm RMA it back to SimpleTech."
1,Too much money for a medicore card,"The card isn't very good and stores pictures too slowly, especialy as you start to fill up the memory. Also SimpleTech's customer support isn't too good. Not one person could tell me what the 'Error Application' message meant when using the Simple Tech CompactFlash Card Reader to get pictures from the card.Stay away from this company."
1,Does not work with Minolta DiMAGE 7i digital cam,"I bought a SimpleTech CompactFalsh card of 256Mb to use with my digital camera (Minolta DiMAGE 7i) but it does not work ! The card works fine on my PC, but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam. I guess SimpleTech must be aware of the problem since their tech support e-mailed me that they would post a patch on their website as soon as they would find one, but of course I had no clue of the compatibility issue before buying the card, so I hope this might help some potential buyers..."
2,Speed IS actually an issue!,"I wonder if the guy from Chicago was on to something when he mentioned the possible lack of good QC with these guys?! My card didn't lock anything up, but it wasn't as responsive as two other brands that I currently use (I won't name them so as to not start a brand loyalty debate). I do believe that I won't try them again until I hit upon their ""good"" cards though."
2,It's dead on the first day!,"I bought a Simpletech 256 Compactflash card two months ago. I opened the package and put it in my Nikon Coolpix 2500. I tried it by taking a couple of pictures. Suddenly, the card stopped working and my camera said CF card Error. :( That was only 10 minutes of using it. Then I tried it with a Canon G2...still did not work...had to return it..."
1,"Will Die, Don't Buy","It's very simple, everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this drive, 4 USB sticks, 3 SD cards, and 1 CF card. Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache."
1,I'm afraid it sucks.,"I saw the negative reviews and thought it must be user error or bad luck to blame, but I'm afraid it's all true. My brand new Simpletech card has gone mysteriously crazy, within 10 minutes of popping it in my Canon S230. I don't care what the explanation is, frankly-- card error is a scary thing to see. Magically, replacing my trusty (if allegedly slower) SanDisk cards rectifies all problems. I swear, I did nothing wrong-- it's idiot proof. This card is just wacky."
3,A bit slow with Nikon coolpix 4300,"Just as some other comments described, the card is slow when used with Nikon camera. When you take a shot, it takes three seconds to complete. It is still within a workable range to me. Nikon's manual does not list SimpleTech as a definite compatible candidate. However, with the price, I think the performance is OK. For people that consider speed an important factor, maybe this card is not a right choice to work with Nikons."
5,Great for the price.,I'm real pleased with the results of digital images shot using the SimpleTech 256MB compactflash as storage. It's speed seems to be on a par with my Microdrives or perhaps a slight bit faster.I think it's great for the price.
1,Not for use with Canon Powershot,"It seems nice enough and it's cheap, but it is apparently incompatible with the Canon Powershot Digital Elphs. For use with those cameras, buy Sandisck instead. Seriously."
3,Extremely slow,Card works but is VERY slow. These are the numbers obtainedwith PCMCIA adaptor on my Linux box:SimpleTech 256MB: write 2749KB/s read 1135KB/sMr Flash 128MB: write 9703KB/s read 5065KB/sSandisk 64MB: write 8831KB/s read 2319KB/sLexar 16MB: write 15636KB/s read 2044KB/sDon't buy it if you:a) want to take multiple-shot pictures (like best picture modein Nikon)b) have high resolution high quality camera (storing 5MpTrueColor photo may take 6 seconds in uncompressed/raw mode!)c) you want your pictures to transfer to your PC quickly andyou have USB2/PCMCIA/firewire CompactFlash reader.d) you use slide adaptor in high resolution mode - filesthen have 10MB and it takes 5s!!! to write them to this card
5,"Fast, high performance cf card.","Got it in a well packaged unit, took it out, put it in my canon s110 and start taking shots. The pictures takes 1 or 2 seconds less than my other cards(Sandisk and PNY) to write. Able to take about 250 shots in HQ mode at max resolution. Download from a card reader is also super fast. Did not do any specific test but it is at least 20 or 30 seconds faster than the other cards I have when downloading 240MB of jpegs to my PC. Again, amazon is prompt with the service and I am a happy camper. Thanks again amazon for giving us outstanding service and products."
1,CF Card Error with Canon G3 like some other reviews,"After a few uses, I got CF Card Error during a function at home with my Canon G3. Going to try if I can get a replacement. Even with that, I don't think I will be using this for any important events.When I buy a card next time, I have to read each and every review and see how many people with G3 got into trouble."
3,"Good Value, but Could Be Faster","While SimpleTech's 256 MB CompactFlash memory card is quite affordable, many users may find it too slow for practical use in today's more memory-intensive digital cameras.If you intend to use it for digital music or cameras of 2 megapixels or so in resolution, great--the card will work just fine. Its 8MB burst and sustained 1.5MB write speeds even work okay in larger resolution cameras for low shooting rates; however, the real bottleneck I found in both my cameras and my laptop was its read time--which could take over a couple of seconds per shot when reviewing pictures!When compared to speed demons like SanDisk's Ultra II cards--or even my backup Vikings--the SimpleTech simply didn't read back quickly enough for my liking. Still, it's on the low end price-wise for 256 MB cards, and for many people the card will work just fine."
5,You can't beat the bang for your buck,"256 MB of storage. That's like 5 million photos or something. (I haven't had the chance nor the reason to fill it up yet...) Huge storage space for a really reasonable price. You really won't need another Flash Card once you've got this one. I've had no problems at all with this. Make sure to get a good Flash Card Reader too, so you can easily transfer your photos from the Card to your hard drive."
4,What a great experiment!,"The Brass Fantasy was a wonderful group that Lester Bowie led--kind of a late 20th century interpretation of the New Orleans brass band, but playing the music of the day. It's a real kick in the pants to hear some of the pop tunes as they are interpreted here. The tuba player rocks! Forget the oom-pah! My favorite is their interpretation of that jukebox favorite, Crazy. This is a great album for someone with a fairly open mind and a good sense of humor."
4,A wonderful discovery,"Martínez Sobral's symphonic scenes Acuarelas Chapinas, is a real revelation. Magnificently orchestrated pieces, they have an immediate and direct impact. As much as Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain or Ives' Three Places in New England, they describe a place, in this case, a city in Latin America circa 1905. Ricardo Castillo's tone poem Xibalbá evoques a world of magic and legends of the Mayan world. This is music that important conductors should take into account to enlarge their repertoires, introducing names from the past that merit the best disclosure."
3,poor intonation,"Lovely, captivating and involving music, but the brass & winds play consistently out of tune. Some will never notice this, but for me it is like nails on a chalkboard. I wonder if the orchestra rehearsed the score at all prior to the recording. As much as I love the music, it is painful to listen to. These composers deserve better treatment than this. I'll give this copy away, and hope a different orchestra and conductor record this music. I will make the same comment on the album ""Guatemala"" (music of Ricardo Castillo only). Save your money."
1,Dragon Fire,I just could not read it; it was too violent and ugly. Perhaps it was just me but I couldn't get past the first chapter.
5,Well researched and informative,I found this book to be an easy read. It sufficiently covered the topics indicated with what appears to be a very objective point of view.I think that this book should be a must-read for anyone on either side of the ongoing debate.
4,Wish this book was available 20 years ago,"Joan Bello adresses feelings I have always had but I was not sure why. Now it makes a lot more sense. One big bonus in reading this book was I now try to pay a lot more attention to my inner self when I am in this higher state of consciousness as opposed to watching TV or something mundane like that. I try to expose myself to more stimulations than I use to. One other thing that I have noticed is I can really feel the depressing nature of alcohol way more than I use to. I have always had the feeling but I did not pay much attention to it. Now I find it really easy to tune into and it turns me off. This book is very interesting, a touch difficult to read in parts but in the end it improves your awareness of yourself and of this little beautiful plant that I have embraced for most of my life."
2,"Beautiful Writing, Boring and Confusing Narrative","In this book many characters are parallel, mimicking thefutility of war and the cycle of meaningless brought onby wars. The characterization lacked depth but the writ-ing ha a beautiful quality of magical realism like inother books by Marquez. Again, Marquez's focus on pedo-philia was disconcerting.How can I like a writer so much yet dislike his book?The answer is that beautiful writing is not enough tocreate a good book. Their needs to be excellence inform and content. Marquez is excellent in form but heis very low in content. I found this book more confus-ing than any other book that I completed. If it hadnot been written by Marquez, I would not have finishedit."
2,I don't understand all the hoopla surrounding this book.,"This book has been extoled over and over to me throughout the years. I tried it about 5 yrs ago and quit after 30 or so pages, but this time when my book group chose it, I was determined to try it again. After all I'm 5 years older. I read it slowly, tried not to analyze it too deeply and become immersed in the flow of the culture. About l00 pages into it, I thought this is really creative and interesting. Fifty pages later, I was bored with its redundancy of characters, names and magical events. It picked up again in the last 50 pages, but it NEVER did for me what so many of the previous readers exclaimed about. I was disappointed. This is one book that didn't live up to its hype."
2,What's all the fuss about?I had to force myself to finish it,"This is just a warning to those of you who think you may have found a new, great author to read: forget it. I completely disagree that this is one of the best books of all time; the book was boring, and its characters were difficult to keep straight due to the author's annoying decision to name them all similarly."
2,What's the fuss all about?,"I was cajoled into reading this ""required reading for all of humanity"" masterpiece. I had to fight to finish this novel - I thought that at the very least, it would be as magical as Allende's House of Spirits, but I was severely disappointed. Unlike everyone else (or so it seems everyone else), this book did not change my sensibilities. The best part of the book was the last 40 or so pages, which ALMOST, almost, made the other 400 pages worthwhile. I do not doubt Garcia Marquez' talent -- what I do believe is a lot was lost in the translation!"
5,I keep returning to re-read this book,"This is the most LUSH book I have ever read. The content is heady like the humid air of the rainforest. It is dense with wise, human understanding, the style straddling poetry and prose. I'll often re-read a paragraph in breathless amazement of what I've just read. I must take it in small bites - as if it's simply too rich, like a steak with bernaise sauce. But each re-reading brings joy."
4,Escapism at its Finest,"I just read Love in the Time of Cholera before this. Marquez has a way with words. They are unlike other fiction I've read. They completely transplant me into the world he creates. As with Love, I felt the environment in every paragraph and experienced the atmosphere the way I imagined the characters t experience it. This novel in particular explores love, pride, deception, family. It evokes feelings of passion, pain, longing, fear of wasted time. I really did enjoy it, I hope my next novel is as giving as this was."
3,Mastering Marquez,"I would recommend GGM's works to every serious reader. However, I would also recommend some experience of the history and culture of his context before beginning. I have read three of his works in quick succession hoping I could benefit from an ""immersion"" experience. I think now Marquez requires more preparation."
3,Classic but Seems a bit Lost in Translation,"This is a great book, but it just didn't hook me. Really the last 1/4 of the book was the best, so worth a bit of a slog through some earlier parts. Maybe it is the translation from Spanish to English, and maybe its that families don't play as key of a role in our identity in U.S. culture as in Latin American culture. It just didn't seem as lyrical and moving as I was expecting. Nonetheless GGM's writing style is unique and fascinating, and the book does provide a glimpse into another way of viewing the world."
3,Moving in small doses,"From what I've heard, this book is far more powerful in the original Spanish, and I can only lament that I don't speak Spanish. I felt that long stretches of the book, such as Colonel Buendia's various revolutions and the chapters dealing with the banana plantation, were great. The elements of magical realism were as touching as they were astonishing. But I never grew unaccustomed to the book's pace, which moves herky-jerky through the decades, sometimes focusing on a single event for pages, then leaping several weeks in a single sentence. In the end, I felt like I hadn't gotten to know a single character. All the people in the book mystified me. Their fears, hopes, and regrets, were lost on me."
4,Over a hundred pages of wonderful solitude,"I read this book in my freshman year of college. I loved it. It has many characters that flow together. The story has a magical realism to it. Characters die and come back to life, people live for years on end. It follows the lives of a family that deals with wars, tragic love, and mysterious dealings. I thorougly enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to enter a magical world filled with vibrant characters taking on all sorts of political and social issues to heart and then bending them as far as they can go. Think Dali."
2,Disappointing - this is not the Colombia I have found,"This book was highly recommended by a number of people who knew I was going to visit Colombia. They said it would explain the culture and tell the story of Colombia. After visiting Colombia and immersing myself in the culture and history of this incredible country, I do not see the fit. Colombia is a country with energy, action and forward momentum rather than a sleepy melancholy society chasing its tail."
2,Middle of the Road,"My experience with 100 Years of Solitude has been that people either love it or they absolutely hate it, but I'm apathetic about it. I had to read it for a world cultures class in college and not even the teacher could tell us how it was relevant to what the class was about. The repetition of the men's names makes for a very confusing story line, and the son that was born with a tail? Weird, to say the least. But apparently this book inspires a lot of people judging by the previous reviews. I would suggest that you read it if for no other reason than to form your own opinion about it."
2,pointless,"I enjoyed the first hundred pages or so. The symbolism was very intriguing, but after a while it was just confusing with too many characters and a meandering plot. I could not stay awake long enough to finish it."
2,Confusion. Intrepidation. Asphyxiation.,"In what appears to be a stab at Western values this Prize winning author has created a confusing mess.Many people take this book and wade through it seeking some sort of enlightenment from such a prestigious work (Nobel Prize 1982). When, in reality, this book is a sophomoric slap at US and Western European anti-communist policies of the Cold War.I am not saying the Western policies were sound, but I will say that communism and the system it supported have been proven to be morally bankrupt and fiscally unsound. Perhaps the politics of the time pushed the Nobel Committee into giving an award that could have been given elsewhere."
1,Huh?,"What is the point of this book? It doesn't have one, in my opinion. The author himself said that the reason for writing it was that he wanted to write a book about incest! I really do not enjoy graphic descriptions of this incest, either. I would not reccommend it to anyone, in fact, I tell others NOT to read it. I wouldn't have read past the tenth page if I hadn't been required to for my English class."
5,A linguistic masterpiece,"Marquez has such an eloquent way with words. He canalso spin an excellent tale as evidenced by this book.But, what I enjoyed most about the book was the strengthand depth of emotion which he was able to convey throughthe written word. This book pulls you into a magical andmorbid world and holds you hostage until the ending. It isan immense book, but well worth the committment. I wouldespecially recommend it to young developing writers. Thisbook will definitely increase your artistic perspectives."
4,A timeless classic,"The One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most interesting novel I have ever read. First it starts with a married couple who are counsins, afraid that they will have a child with a pig tail, a myth about what happens when you marry close relations. This novel has the most confusing set of characters with the same name carried on from generation to generation. And this novel has some of the most interesting events that you will ever read. As you read this novel, you can actually see each charactrer falling into their life of solitude, one by one.This novel is very good, and I highly recommend it."
3,"Great literature, not so good read","I recognize the importance of this book and it's achievement in literary history as well as for latin american literature, but the book is still very difficult to read only because I wanted to enjoy it so much, but often found myself lost. Maybe that's what is supposed to happen, but it gets frustrating. I found A Clockwork Orange, Trainspotting, Maribou Storke Nightmares and Slaughterhouse Five all easier to read than this and most of those took some work. It doesn't have anything to do with the words or dialog. I admire the simple prose and find a majority of the book thoughtful and beautiful, but the circular story structure and the multitude of character names being so similar (especially in the later generations) does start to wear on you. I recommend it, with a warning."
2,Maybe I just don't get it,"Not sure why this book has been so raved about. When I bought it, the book store clerk told me it was his ""favorite book ever"". That's quite an endorsement.I found it to be really uninteresting. It's almost all exposition, with little dialogue. The characters may be ""memorable"", but only because they're ""boring"". None of them have any personality (although one is well-endowed, which is nice) and is the author just *trying* to be difficult when he gives them all such similar names?This book felt like the authors parents told him lots of stories and fables when he was growing up, and he tried to cram them all into one long stream on consciousness tale. I abandoned it half-way through."
2,Yawn.,Characters aren't interesting. The story is not compelling. The plot is not engaging. No mystery of any kind. Just dull. Much ado ... why?
1,I hated this book,"This book was a total waste of time. I kept thinking that it was going to lead somewhere or reveal something, but it never did- it just kept repeating names until I had no idea and no longer cared who was who and rambled on to an unfulfilling end."
1,Disappointment,"I read this book after it was recommended by Oprah as being considered ""perhaps the best book ever written""! What a disappointment... I slogged my way through it, thinking ""it must get better if it's the best book ever written""... but alas, no, it didn't.I am a voracious reader, and read fro 2-5 books a week. I noticed Amazon recommended ""if you like this, you'll like Catch 22"". I loved Catch 22! I HATED this book! What am I missing here?"
3,"Good, but not great.","Honestly i cant really see why this book in particular is so great as to deserve a nobel prize, just this book at least. I havnt read any of the authors other works, which may be a little more deserving. Anyhow, the book is genuinely origional. The idea of a story that goes through a whole family's rise and fall was great, the repetiton of names, however much it was needed for the underlying ideology of the story, got to be a little too much for me to bear though, bordering on annoyance. The book itself never really drew me into it either, too many parts of it read like a history textbook, by the time the last few chapters rolled around I was just reading to finish it up, desperately hoping for something to save it, and the ending, however meaningful, was too little too late. The book did have its moments, dont get me wrong, but for me the cons too much outwieghed the pros."
1,"Magical, mystical piece of tripe","I read (well, not really...I got to page 100 and felt like I'd read it three times already) this book over ten years ago and I still rank it as the worse piece of tripe that I ever had the misfortune to come across. But I'm biased. Like most Latins, I think the whole ""magical and mysterious"" cloak with which Latin literature is viewed abroad is unfortunate, but ultimately it's that kind of rubbish that sells."
1,Not for everyone,"I will not critize this book too heavily, as apparently it is a classic and many people find it delightful. However, I found the book extremely hard to follow, and without any identifyable plot line. Yes, it is interesting to see how a city can develop over 100 years of time, but all the characters kept dying off, and I found myself not being bothered by it, as nothing made me connect with them through the book. I really just did not find the book enjoyable enough to continue past 2/3rds the way in to it ."
1,Glad to be done with this one,"I pride myself on finishing every book I begin reading, but this novel severely tested my perseverance. I kept waiting for the story to generate even a spark of interest but it just never happened for me. Admittedly Marquez is a gifted writer and for this reason I was tempted to award the book 2 stars, but if I had to sum up the book in one word it would be PAINFUL, thus the single star. I've read a number of 'classics' which were difficult reads, but there were usually rewards for the effort. I can't say the same for this book."
1,The author put one over on us...,"10,000 ideas thrown up in the air and landed randomly on pages.Characters not even likeable except for Ursula. Too muchridiculous stuff making story unbelievable. The author reallyhas put one over on the public; I could have written a betterbook!"
2,Most overrated book of the century,So if nobody understands what the heck the author is trying to say means that the book rates five stars? I think not.
5,A mirage of life,"One Hunderd Years of Solitude left me disturbed.From the happy tale of two young lovers, who carveout a new village for themselves, to the incestousaccount of the last descendants of the family,the book has the power to unnerve the reader. Thestory rambles, so that you feel that time issuspended in Mocando. And yet as charactersgrow older, you notice that time is in fact movingin a circle. The same members of the family are reborn in theArcadia family, reincarnated as the 100 years passby. The forces compelling them to act as theydo, attract and repel you at the same time. Youtry and understand the events and thecharacters, but sheer incredulity and awe asthe story unfolds, leaves you stupefied. I amnot sure I love the book like I do ""Jane Eyre""or admire it like I do ""War and Peace"".But I am powerfully attracted by it, and I'd like toread it again - if only to marvel at a magicalfamily, banished to one hunderd years of solitude.<BR"
4,Literature at its best.,"My 24 year old daughter had to read this for college, she raved about it all during the time they reviewed it in class. I have always been an avid reader and decided to give it a shot. It was......interesting to say the least, a little hard to follow if you haven't read anything deep and introspective. However I loved the story and it was fun to read"
5,Deeply moving and extremely interesting,"Recently in my college English class we were discussing books that we read in high school. My professor asked us to list the ones that we hated on the board and someone listed ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"". Many people agreed with her, but I must say I do not. I absolutely loved this book! I actually was not required to read it in high school, I was learning Spanish at the time and was looking for a book with elements of Spanish culture. It is long, and drawn out, and confusing and that is what makes it amazing. After finishing it I felt like I had lived it instead of reading it. I highly recommend it. If you are required to read this book in school give it a chance before you toss it aside because it is long, or it looks boring. It takes some time in the beginning to get into it but once you do, if you go into it with an open mind, you will not regret it."
4,My first Marquez Encounter,I'd never read anything like this book before. Never even thought about almond trees until this book had me imagining it's smell. Although I was a bit biased at first this book opened me up to a whole new kind of prose. Needless to say this book had me reading every Marquez novel I could find.
5,A Victory of Literature,"A professor suggested Marquez's novel to me a few weeks ago. He has a doctorate in English (creative writing is his specialty) and suggested the novel to a graduating Master's student that felt undereducated. I found the work to be profound, enjoyable, and magical. Marquez is unparalleled in his art. Reviewing some of the previous comments, I am saddened by some of the negative comments. I encourage anyone to read the novel and to allow themselves to be pulled into Marquez's Macondo, from which you may gain new perspectives on time, age, personality, knowledge, details, worth, courage, fear, history, beauty, perception, magic, life, and love. I hope you will enjoy this novel as much as I did and praise it as long as the stars shall shine. This work is a victory of literature.-Foolish Buddha"
4,The amazing story of a remote village,"When reading this epic I came to the conclusion that it is one of the most amazing stories I've ever read. It tells the story of the Buendia family and the creation of Macondo, a village where amazing things take place as a part of everyday life. We follow the Buendias from their fouding of Macondo and down to their descendents a hundred years later. This fiction portray several other interesting characters as well as they come to Macondo for a quick visit. Some more frequently than others. I read this in swedish so I won't comment the language."
5,A Sea of Latino Enchantment,"I have read this extraordinary book in Rabassa's excellent translation...and now wil read it in Spanish to compare....like many others, the book took several attempts on my part to make it through...but once I did, I was drawn into a world that seemed to breathe outside of town and yet not so far from our reality...here the world is seen with eyes outside of linear time. beholding things such as ice for the first time.. you will find even eferences to the Ascension with Remedios the Beauty rising upward lost beyond the reaches of the birds of memory...or the plague of insomnia, with forgetfulness and reality slipping away with the meaning of words...here you will find passions celebrated among butterflies and scorpions...it is epic, full of revolutions, passions, discoveries, magic, all flowing from the banana town whose solitude was to be wiped by the winds...."
3,"Great work of literature, bad edition.","The book is great. However, this particular copy was not well bound and the pages were not well cut. I returned it and received another copy in a similar bad state. If you plan to read this book, buy another edition."
5,Perfection,"This is by far, the best novel i have ever read in my whole 29 years . . . I was dreaming through the pages of this epic story of 7 generations , , wonderful by all means."
5,Boys with the tails of pigs,"This book frustrates me, but in a good way. Reading it, get this feeling of how difficult life is to understand. It's just such a great book-- it makes you laugh, it depresses you, it makes you think and it just leaves mesmerized. Go ahead and buy this book, read it, and you won't be left feeling disappointed."
5,One of the greatest I have ever read,"This book makes me want to learn Spanish so I can read it in Marquez's original language.This story is an epic of a kind you've never read. No heroes, no great voyage - just a family and their town. It's a kind of Book of Genesis for the Buendia family, a family that you will know intimately by the end of the novel as if it's your own.Marquez skillfully blends the tangible realities of hard life with supernatural interludes that help make this book one of the most beautifully poetic that I've ever read. It's the kind of book that when you finish - incidentally having one of the most perfect endings put to paper - you will sit back and think about it for a while. You will walk the hallways of the Buendia house long after you finish this book and swear that you've known the many people that lived and died there. And you will miss them.This book is a masterpiece. Put this first on your list."
4,Fantastical history of a common clan,"This surrealistic excursion, told matter of factly in a style reminiscient of James Joyce, traces the life of several generations of the Buendia family, ordinary folks living ordinary lives in a small Colombian town who accidentally become witnesses to such monumental events as civil war, plagues, social oppresion while cherishing passionate encounters and obsessive fixations on obscure activities. Only in the final pages does it become clear that all which has transpired over the generations was foretold as the rise and fall of the Buendia family by the mystical gypsy Maquiliades. I suspect this literary masterpiece is more impressive in its original Spanish version, but its constant surprises and matter of fact style compel the reader's attention."
5,Masterpiece,"This is my favorite novel by some distance. The novel is simultaneously the story of several generations of an extended family and the story of the entire human race from the beginning of history. It is full of magic not only in the sense that magical things happen, but also in its glowing prose and deeply sympathetic portrayals of its characters. The repetition and near-repetitions of names over the generations invite the reader to conflate information about different characters, demonstrating the interconnectedness of the family members. Maybe it doesn't matter if we keep their identities straight, and maybe we're not even supposed to. Let the plot swirl and let Marquez work his magic. Then step outside and notice how the world shimmers and glows."
2,Not impressed,"I am sorry to say that I gave up on the book. I tried and even read some very intellectually capable folks reviews to see if I was missing something. I came to the conclusion that an individual who rarely reads fiction and who is an engineer by training could probably never ""get"" something like this book. It almost seems that the technique of the writer fascinates many of the readers perhaps more than the substance. The magical realism style is too much for me. I regret I could not finish Nobel prize winning author or not- maybe at some future date I will go back and try again. Sorry ----"
2,Too Boring to Continue,"I only made it to 195 pages. The book is just boring. A lot of sound and fury signifying very little. There are marriages; there are deaths; there are love affairs; there are suicides; there are battles... so a lot does happen. BUT-- I don't care about the characters. If you don't care about the characters, then all their quirky faults seem abstract and dull. Like dusty butterflies in a catalog, their various lives are chronicled. It's a dry description of their adventures and I'm left with a ""so what?"" Maybe his dryness passes for sophistication, but this book left me cold."
5,Beautiful and stunning fiction,"This is the best book I've read since The Triumph and the Glory. The quality of the writing is just superb. The characters so unrelentingly vivid they become as familiar as family. A very good book, I highly recommend it and cam just about guarantee that you will like it. Five stars."
5,You will be amazed,"This is one of those books that you will make all of your friends read once you have experienced its magic. It will take your through a hundred years of deaths, births, tragedies, and joys of a cursed family. And the best part is the ending - a conclusion that will leave you breathless!"
4,Fascinating but confusing,"One Hundred Years of Solitude chronicles 100 years of a family (of Buendia) and a village (city) that the ""first of the family line"" founded. The prose is lyrical and flows as smoothly as a river. That is, sometimes there are rapids and other times calm. The genre is magical realism, and it is fascinating watching the magic evolve with the family and village. After finishing this book, I'm not 100% certain what Marquez meant by it, though. It has anti-war and anti-oppressive-regime themes, but there's something more that I haven't quite put my finger on yet. I may need to re-read it after letting it settle for a while."
5,"Not easy to read, but worth it","It's a sophisticated read with MANY subplots (most of which include characters with the same name). It can be confusing at times, but it's a good book once you learn each character. I read this book 5 times since 2008 and each time I read it, I discover something new. Don't expect a book you can just read once and move on with your life. It's not that simple."
5,"Monumental, Mesmerizing!","Most likely the greatest epic I have ever read. The story grips you, pulls you in, and commands 100% of your concentration. Marquez deserves two Nobel Prizes for this tale."
4,Mind Boggle!,"This story really does take a geniune effort to read. With that it is a fantastic journey that will toy with your emotions in both positive and negative ways. A little confusing at times, but with steady reading it all comes together. Wonderful piece of literature!"
5,Could be the best Novel ever written,This book blew my mind. I can be a bit slow and confusing (there are many characters with the same of very similar names) but the writing is of a caliber seldom seen. The story is intense and the people stick with you for years!
2,Columbian family values,"Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what I hope is an atypical Columbian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilictions."
3,"Complicated, entertaining, frustrating","I've heard a lot about this book recently, so I thought I'd give it a whirl when I saw it at the local library. The plot was extremely intruiging - the tale of the Buendia family, original settlers of the fictional town of Macondo in what seems to be South America. The characters were unique and colorful and I enjoyed traveling the generations of the family and sharing their experiences.However, someone in each generation (and sometimes more than one person) was named a variant of Aureliano or Jose. I was constantly confused at which character experienced what and feeling as if the plot was contradicting itself. I continually flipped back and forth with the family tree provided at the beginning of the book which caused me to feel disconnected from the story. I would lose track of the plot and ended up rereading many sections multiple times.Eventually, I felt like reading the book was a chore, and I'll admit, I was relieved when I finally finished it."
2,lesson in depravity of man,"As I opened this book, I thought to myself ""Wow! This seems like a great story!"" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."
3,You have to be fascinated by Gabriel,"to relate to his writing style, otherwise you'll find it dull and boring. Just as I did. I'm not that much of a fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's books, because most, if not all, of them are written in a sense that the writer is making up the story as you read along... A sense of disorientation. I don't like that in a book. I like a story line, somthing to expect to... suspense, drama... not a vague idea as to what the writer thinks of his hero's (or his own?) miserable life.It's written beautifully, that's for sure. But it's most certainly not enough. Being able to write attractive and intellectual phrases does not make a bad story better. Especially if there's no story at all. I didn't like."
2,Zzzz ...,"One hundred years of characters and you won't care about one. This novel is overloaded with characters, but I didn't feel much of anything for any of them. It lacks focus, and failed to make me care about anything that happened in the story."
1,500 pages of boredom,"The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores."
1,Classic?,"I'll come clean first. I stopped reading after 100 pages. A lot happens in this book, with deaths and spirits and insomnia and marriages, and it's all fairly easy enough to figure out what's going on. Yet, nothing happens. So much plot takes place that the characterization suffers. I simply didn't care what happened to the characters, or anyone in the town. If a bomb had levelled Macondo, I would have simply flipped to the next page to see what happened next, not to read on about the characters. If you're interested in a classic worthy of its praise, where characterization is king, do yourself a favor and pick up Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. You'll work to read, but your mind and soul will be enriched. Faulkner's novels are like movies you watch in slow motion to get every nuance. Marquez, on the other hand, is like a movie you watch in fast forward. You get the plot and action, but when all is said and done, nothing sticks in your mind that is worthy of the space it occupies."
2,Not a fun read,"I can see this is an unpopular but not unique opinion, but this is one of the very few books I've stopped reading halfway through. And I have no intention of ever finishing it. Despite the fact that I horde books, I gave this one away.While the prose was beautiful, the story tended toward the dull and was difficult to follow. The fact that there were only a handful of names reused by dozens of characters did not help much. Most of the characters were unlikable and hard to relate to. After awhile I decided I just didn't care anymore.Is this book a masterpiece? Perhaps it is, but that doesn't mean it's a good read."
5,A Very Important Novel,"One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read ( and I have read thousands).Marquez is a giant. His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece."
5,great book,This book captivates you from beginning to end. I fell in love with the characters and enjoyed the colorful lives of each one. The symbolism and translation make this book one of a kind.
5,MUST READ!,"This is a book that comes but once in a lifetime. Everyone should read it. It is an interesting journey that will allow your mind and senses to places they've never been before. Don't be scared by its number of pages, it is an adventure one should undergo at least once."
2,100 years of slow reading,"This highly overrated book indicates the havoc that overweight talk show hosts can wreak upon the literary world. Garcia's most juvenile and frustrating book is now being yammered about by book clubs the world over who suddenly think they know about South American authors.The book is overly long and repetitive; themes are repeated ad nauseum. Characters (some of whom have the same name) are one dimensional and unbelievable. By the time you reach the halfway point in the book you are praying for something different to happen. Then Garcia introduces a new character, has him act just like all the others, and die within 3 pages. It's amazing how quickly he mows down his creations, as if he is as tired of them as I was.In the end there are no surprises, and you feel exhausted from the repetition. Underwhelming, and nowhere near as good as ""Love in the Time of Cholera"".Give it a miss and try ""Blindness"" instead."
1,big disappointment,"I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can't believe all the ""5 star"" reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection. The characters are meaningless, the text is scattered and awkward. Perhaps something was lost in translation, who knows. I've never been one to give up on a book but I considered it many times with this one."
1,100 years of boreitude,"I can count on one hand the number of books in my life that I have been unable to finish. I am oftimes mocked for my reading, the rate at which I devour books being astronomical, but I could not drag my weary brain kicking and screaming through more than a few dozen pages of this book.I love a good fantasy novel, or anything that gives you a sense of the magical, but I could not find anything interesting in the random and inexplicable bizarre occurrences in this book. Mix that with the dry, long winded prose and I find myself doing something I have NEVER done; sitting with a book in my hands, looking around the room for something else to do."
2,Gave Up On It,"found this a very weird book,just couldn't get going with it..maybe it was the translation..I might try again soon"
1,Disappointed,"I expected much more from this book. It started out interesting enough but, seemed to drag on and on. In the end it was depressing and a little confusing. I like a fiction book to be entertaining and thought provoking; with a point, I did not at all enjoy this book."
4,The Tale of Human Existence told by one Writer,"It takes a writer like Garcia to undertake a novel of such mythic proportions. He weaves magic and fantasy into the politics of progress and greed, the loves, hates, incest and lies of human existence. Macondo is every place and Buendia is every man and woman. Garcia draws the reader to experience the depth and purity of the soul even as he constantly parodies its high moral ground by bodily functions and the smell of human pain and suffering. He lulls the reader into the bliss of solitude but forces them to confront the unbearable loneliness that it breeds. Here is life in all her forms!"
5,One of the best novels of the past 100 years,"Marquez creates a unique fictional world, a town called Macondo in the middle of the South American jungle.The language is lush, the characters unique. Marquez finally trusts the reader to accept fantasy and reality as equal partners in an ongoing unfolding of life.This is the only novel I've read four times. It works like magic, like great wine, like a wonderful piece of music."
5,"The First Hundred Pages of ""Solitude.""","I have ony read the first 100 pages of this book and the adjective ""engrossing"" is but an understatement. From the moment the family patriarch becomes obsessed with the magnets and alchemy equipment of the gypsies to the marriage of Rebeca, this literary trip has so far been an odysseey which leaves most everybody's family trees for wanting.Aside from the title theme of desolation is the less obvious but equally salient theme of discovery and its relationship to the science/magic dichotomy (I guess that this is the essence of this so-called ""magical realism"" phenomenon). Rarely has this subject matter been tackled with such perceptiveness and aesthetic. Though I have only read the beginning, I find myself wishing that the book were even longer than it already is.Thank you, Gabriel Garcia Marquez!"
4,A Century of Solitude,"I found this book a little difficult getting started due to the way the author seems to skip aroundand introduces so many new characters but after about a third through the book, I began to get into it.The over all scope of the novel and the intimate details of emotions and feelings gives the story a realsense of feeling. It was a slow read as I kept going back and forth with it for about four weeks but I amhappy to have read it and now have a better understanding of another place and another culture."
2,GET YOUR SLEEPING BAGS READY!,"CUZ THIS BOOK IS A ""SNOOZE FEST!""ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE IS RIGHT CUZ THAT'S HOW MUCH TIME YOU'LL NEED IF YOU EVER WANNA FINISH THIS!I HIGHLY DOUBT OPRAH MADE IT PAST CHAPTER ONE.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
5,Magical Realism at its best,"I guess that is where this book is usually categorized in. Apparently, Gabriel Garcia Marquez popularized the genre. I loved the book and would put it in the top five of my list. There are people who I've talked to that thinks it was confusing or complicated. That was not the case for me. It's true that there were many characters (and it does not help that a lot of them are named similarly). But, I think each of them is distinct and was developed very well. The book is not about the town of Macondo...it's about the people who lived there. And, you will be able to relate to the book because of its very human characters set in an environment that is often very real but occasionally eerily surreal. That's magical realism for you."
3,The 4th of July,"If the 4th of July was every day, day in and day out, I think we would all get pretty dang sick of fireworks. That pretty much describes how I feel about Marquez and this book; it is a parade that lasts hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages, and an endless display of literary aesthetic achievements.If, however, you can remember back to the days of the ""Where's the Beef?"" ads, you might understand my irritation at a flawlessly written novel that lacks a cohesive idea - even a thread of one - to unify all the beauty contained therein. Is this book a masterpiece? Undoubtedly, for its perfection of style and flavor. Could it have been more? Could Marquez have added substance to his style? Much more?Sadly, yes."
2,Enough is Enough,"Just recently, I decided to give this book a second chance. Like other reviewers here, I hardly ever give up on a book. But about 30 pages into the SECOND attempt, I am feeling exhausted. All of the bright and shiny books on my bookshelves have never looked so good at this point. So I came here, read the reviews and feel better. I think I can put this book away and be at peace with not appreciating it. I will say, some of the words Marquez uses- his descriptions, seem to have been created especially for the world that exists within this book. But is the trip worth it? I have decided that it is not. Thank you all for helping me be at peace with NOT completing this novel."
1,You must read this book!,This was my first encounter with the magical realism style and I love it! The Buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing I have encountered in any book. A must read.
1,Nobel Prize?,So if the Nobel Prize is for the author's body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that's in capital letters). If this is his best work and most famous work and it is a labor to read then his other works must be capital punishment!!!Much like the best book of the century by James Joyce - Ulysses.Again another book to be placed in Solitary Confinement!!!
2,Pretty stupid,"Starts off good, but after about 200 pages, it gets pretty stupid. Lots of repetition, and very trite. Totally unbelievable too; some of the stuff that happened in this book would NEVER happen in real life, such as a girl floating up into the sky, or people living into their 120s. Ant the book didn't even have any pictures!!! OMG!!! Check out the General and his Labrynth if you want to read something good by Garcia Marquez (or ""Call of the Wild"" by Jack London, perhaps the best book ever)."
1,pointless,This is one of the hardest to read most pointless books I have ever had the misfortune of trying to read.
5,The best book ever,"One Hundred .... was the first book by García Marquez I read, since then I have read all his work, but I will never be so impressed by a book as I was with this one, the moment I finished it, I began again. The last pages got me so much that I kept doing as Aureliano was doing at the moment, trying to skip some bits to reach the end and find out what was the mistery of the book. Is a masterpice that everyone should read at least three times. It might not be the most beautiful one I've ever read, that is for sure ' Love in the times of cholera', but it is, for sure, the most powerfull."
3,Groundbreaking and interesting in theory. Horrendous to actually read.,"I understand that this book was absolutely groundbreaking and created whole new literary techniques. But that's the only thing that made me slog through it. I kept expecting it to get better, but it didn't. I'm glad I was never assigned to read this in school.If I want magical realism, I'll stick to Isabelle Allende. Though my friends say Love in the Time of Cholera is amazing. I plan to give GGM a second chance."
5,Use of language,"I was surprised at how little was lost in the translation of this book. Garcia writes this novel as if it were poetry, he has a wonderful use of language that seems to braid mystical as well as humurous aspects into his writing. This is a novel that I won't forget and recommend readily."
3,I Love this author's WAY of writing,"First I read ""Love in the Time of Cholera"". That book I keep always open ready for the moment. So I was curious to read an earlier book by Marquez. Maybe it is also a great book, but after ""Love.."" I found it disturbing mainly because of its fantacy and lack of clarity by comparison. If you go for mystery and underlying meanings and lots and lots of characters then this is for you. Marquez paints vivid word pictures. but I think he grew wonderfully after he wrote 100 years of Solitude. Maybe he emerged out of solitude to find ""Love""!"
2,One of the few books I have stopped reading,"I even finished Brothers Karamazov and Bleak House, but this one I quit. I felt like I was wasting my time trying to remember the characters and their relations and what in the world is occuring in this make believe town of Macondo. Marquez may be a skilled writer and storyteller, but this book confused, bored and frustrated me without offering entertainment or insight.So what if Oprah picked it and if it has been labled a classic...it is not enjoyable or remarkable to me. I think I made it to about page 150 or so.With so many books to read, why waste time trying to decipher this one?"
2,"Great Discussion Book, Bad Airplane Book","I think that Mr. Marquez is a far superior story teller than he is a writer. It is too bad you can't sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the ""hidden gems"" will be missed if there are any. On the whole, I just couldn't shake the vibe that I was reading an extended version of the Old Man and the Sea.It was interesting from the point of reading a Mexican writer."
2,One Hundred Years of Solitude,"Disturbing! This is the only single word that I can use to describe this book.Although definatley unique it the composition style, the book is dark and depressing. The theme of incest and child porn appeared to be the primary focus in the book instead of creationalism as eluded to in other reviews.It had an interesting ending but not worthy of the time spent leading up to it."
3,I wish I cared about these people,"Yes Mr. Marquez is very intelligent and has a remarkable story-telling ability, but the thing he wasn't able to do for me, was get me to care about the characters. He lost 2 stars for that. It was in certain parts very interesting and rich in detail, but I have to admit, I forced myself through many parts of it. And did Mr. Marquez try to act a little 'Joycean' by making his sentences long.....(look at pgs. 329-331 paperback edition)? And yes, I have the same gripe about similar sounding names. However if the reader keeps reading, he/she can usually figure out what is what by the context. Mr. Marquez, very few will ever win a Nobel in literature, but could you please pump out something in what I know is your brillant mind, that will make me CARE.?"
4,Suprising...,"I read this book during one of my sophomore literature courses (course selection) and I was kind of blown away. It's the type of book that you pick up and really can't put back down without being mysteriously drawn back to it. Within the bounds of the book, you get sucked into wondering how in the world the Buendía family became so [messed] up and end up marvelling at the ""progress"" of their town. I didn't give it five stars because I thought that it became kind of murky towards the end, kind of hard to follow. Be warned though, this is a pretty dark book, and if you're one to desire that resolution occur for the sake of having an ending, then don't read this - it might make you angry. If you don't mind a bit of random humor and can breeze past the bit of vulgarity that's in the book, then press on. It's a great read, especially on a rainy day when tornadoes are on the prowl."
5,Beyond most....,"This book seems to move beyond so many other books not only in its message, but also in the beauty of description. The intricacy and almost surrealism of the plot draws the reader in so intently its exhilarating. Also, the tone is calming as you learn of the Buendia family and their history. You will come away from this book with a sharper eye for the magical aspects of everyday life, as well as a few hours of absolute escape and bliss. Read it. You're not likely to regret it!"
5,An exprience that lives with you for the rest of your life,"I read this book many many years ago when I was 14. I did not read it in English or Spanish. At the time I didn't know either one. I read it in Persian, but that did not diminish the effect it had on me at all. I guess the translation must have been good. I must have read the book some 12 times over the period of that year. And still, every once in while as I am driving my car, a passage from the book comes to my mind and takes me back to the magic that it was. I do not want to read this book again. I don't think that after getting accustomed to the reality of life around me my heart can handle such surge of emotions as it did then. If you haven't read it though, and you are able to pull yourself back to reality after finishing the book, I strongly recommend it."
4,Fanciful writing,"I just finished reading this book, and like most fresh reads it is staying on my mind. The writing from the first chapter is so fanciful and descriptive it compares to no other. I loved and hated this book at the same time. It is dark, it is about family and war and infidelity and love. It doesn't mention the word solitude until you're about half way through - and when Marquez does mention it, he keeps mentioning it and it seems to be the obvious title for the book. It is almost like when he first says it, you experience his ""Ah, ha"" moment. Being a happy go lucky person myself, I found myself rooting for happiness, and there is happiness. It is a good read. It comes full circle. Enjoy"
5,Wow,"Magic realism plus rich, beautiful latin culture combines to make a beautiful novel of a town's history. So many wonderfully impossible things happen that this was just a treat to read, even during the heart wrenching moments. I think it's one of the riskier books for Oprah's club, but I can't wait to see what people say. Splendid!"
1,Emporer's new clothes.,"I'm one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so I plugged away hoping I'd experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found...but I just didn't get it. Maybe it lost something in the translation, but I prefer a little dialog in my fiction...even in my heavy, pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction. I don't mind the magic realism, but I do get bored with sentences that run on for two-plus pages without a period. Oh, well, chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck who's educated beyond his intelligence. But I was underwhelmed."
1,"Oh, my.","I recognize that lots of people think this book is wonderful. However, as an extremely well-read English major, I think Marquez must be laughing. Without repeating the comments of the other one-star reviewers, I'll just say that I was more than underwhelmed. It's nonsenical, and (am I the only one who noticed?) misogynistic."
1,Struggling,"I agree with the other reviewers that say this book is tedious and much overrated. I read quite a bit, and I usually enjoy everything I read. However, I just cannot get in to this book. Yes, it is rambling, confusing, and all those other adjectives someone else used. But I don't want rambling and confusing. I don't want to be spoon fed, but it would be nice if there were an identifiable path for the book. I wonder how much is lost in the English translation, and if it would be a much better read in its native language.I am a few hundred pages into the book. I'll keep reading -- and keep hoping that it improves."
3,used book,"I have purchased ""excelent"" used books before but his came with writing in the text. This book was not in ""excelent condition"""
1,Appalling. . .,"I checked this book out of the library after reading rave review after rave review.I wanted to like it, I really did, but I honestly cannot understand all the high marks. To me the book reads as if it were written by a 6th-grader. Characterization and storyline aside, the language itself is what turned me off. It seemed stilted, contrived, lacking in fluidity, and devoid of any real color; an amateurish effort at best.Perhaps this reads better in its native tongue, but the translation I read was atrocious. I promptly returned it to the library, shooting it soundly down the return bin with a force that it so richly deserved."
2,Glad I'm not alone in my opinion,"I came back to read the Amazon reviews because, after reading half of this book, I've begun to wonder when/if it's going to get good. I hate to put down a book I've started- even if it bores me- so I wanted to be reminded of how great this one is supposed to be. Now I know I'm not alone in my confusion. This book came very highly recommended, but I've just been waiting and waiting to enjoy it. I think I've gone far enough and I can return it to the library. I'm really glad I didn't buy it."
1,very bad paper quallity,very bad paper quality. some of them torn on side. papers had different size!!! so some were popping out of book!!! not happy with my purchase.
4,Definitely Different,"I am an avid book reader, but I have never read anything like this book. It is definitely different. Reviews on Oprah's book club site stated how many people cried at the end. I didn't--I didn't really like any of the characters. I do not know if it was because of a cultural difference or what. Basically I think it was because I could not get over the way Marquez writes about women...and the incest. Let's just say I was totally amazed to find out the author was actually married. However, it is a real experience to read and discuss this book with just about anyone. And the ending is superb--one of the best I've ever read."
2,"Some good qualities, but no cohesiveness or overall point","I am an avid reader, and I don't mind a challenging read. I started reading this book at the suggestion of some colleagues, and a woman in my book club. I know it is considered a ""modern classic"", won the Nobel Prize, etc. - but I couldn't even pretend to like this book. To the author's credit, his imagery and descriptions are beautiful. I admired the magical world that was evoked by the style of storytelling. But the plot was next to nonexistent, and after about 100 pages, I really felt like I was on a road to nowhere. The story went off on tangent after tangent with no real, identifiable purpose. Reading this book gave me the feeling of being locked in a room with a very creative, yet nonsensical crazy person that won't shut up. After a while, it gets old."
2,"Entertaining in short doses, funny in observation of people, hard work","I enjoyed it mostly although it was hard going. I'm not sure what it was about except I think it was partly about how we can live very close to other people and still not understand each other at all. This was a group of people leading lives of solitude although they were supposed to be family and community. I grew to like the weirdness like the ghosts, and the bizarre happenings. I think the author was writing as if what goes on in your own head was actually real. The cover said it was enthralling - I did not think so. It also said it was supernatural, magical which it was."
5,Keep trying to read this if at first you put it down,"My first couple of tries at reading this book didn't go very far. I never made it beyond the first chapter. Then on a visit to Colombia I was determined to read this book. I kept at it. Before long I was totally absorbed into the story, which is truly fascinating and amazing. Now I don't know why I could not get into it on my earlier attempts. I'm so glad that I persisted. So, the book that I originally couldn't get into, finally became one of my favorite novels."
5,Stunning literary masterpeice,"This is a stunning literary masterpiece. It takes some patience to get into but once you are involved in the story, it is difficult to put down. God, after I finished reading the book it felt like I went into shock. The prose is gorgeous but it is the larger story, stories within stories, and metaphors that are so striking. Will stay with me for the rest of my life."
5,Magical and All Encompassing,"A few writers in each generation are gifted with such writing talent that they create books that make you catch your breath. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of those writers. His gift with prose, the way he uses language, his storytelling ability is staggering. This is an engrossing read from the very first sentence. You will be captivated by the magical world that has been created and the all too human characters that populate the story.For reading pleasure, I would recommend the Harper Perennial Modern Classics edition of this book, which has those very convenient flaps on the front and back covers that make perfect bookmarks to save your page when you do manage to put the book down!"
5,U will never read anything like it,"I read One Hudred Years of SOlitude like 6 times over the years, and it still holds its magic and atmosphyre. Just an unbelievable classic. It feels weary and long at moments, also distracting at moments but its originality and magical ventures arise and fill the soul. Must have."
