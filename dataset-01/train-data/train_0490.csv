5,Horse Heaven,"Horse Heaven is well paced novel about the thoroughbred horse racing industry. Jane Smiley skillfully relates her intimate knowledge of the business and it's eclectic owners, trainers, and hangers-on. Unique to the genre is her talent of relating the unvarnished nuances of the industry from the equine athlete's point of view.A wonderful adult read especially appreciated by animal lovers and horse enthusiasts."
3,enjoyable but too encyclopedic,"I enjoy Jane Smiley's novels and am enjoying this one too, but.....too many characters not given enough time in each chapter for the reader to develop a clear sense of who they are. After a while most of the characters merge together. It would have been a better novel if she had written about fewer characters in more depth. Why she does this I don't know. Maybe she needs a stricter editor, because she is certainly an amazing writer. A smaller canvas is sometimes way more effective."
3,I Tried...I Really Tried,"I love Jane Smiley. I love horses and dogs. I love to read a big, rolling story. I REALLY wanted to love Horse Heaven. But I could barely get through it, and did so only because I paid full price for the book the minute it came out! I could not keep the characters straight...I was totally bored by race-talk. With so many characters it was difficult to really care about any of them (though I did have more interest in the four-leggeds than in the two-leggeds.) I was glad to shelve this and dive into Joyce Carol Oates' BLONDE (so far so wonderful)"
2,"Loses by a Length (the book's length, that is)","I hoped this would be Moo in the horse world, but it's too disjointed, too unfocused, too overpopulated by characters we don't meet long enough to care about, or even remember. (It doesn't help that there are characters named Leo and Leon, Deirdre and Deedee, and Ellen and Eileen). It also lacked the brilliant humor of Moo. It was hard work to slog through this book, and I felt very little reward for my efforts at the end. I'm a horse-lover and a Smiley-lover, but the combination didn't work this time. Jane, choose a smaller canvas for your next work!"
2,Her worst book,I've read and enjoyed several of her books. This one is a stinker for several reasons--1) Way too many characters most of whom frankly aren't very interesting. 2) Anthropomorphism; how does she know what the horses are thinking? 3) Too long 4) Dumb plot gimmicks like the woman who can communicate with horses by reading their thoughts.
2,I only borrowed this book because it was about horse racing,"and I've been a racing fan for about 25 years now. If I could've edited this book, it would only be half as long. Way way too many scenes that did absolutely nothing to advance the plot--why were they there? Cheap thrills? In thinking about this book, and why did I keep on reading it, I'd have to say it was because of the equine characters--they're very interesting and you care about them. The human characters: so-so. I skipped over many passages and didn't miss anything important to the story. All in all, an OK read."
4,I'm not interested in horses,"BUT, I love this book. I am fascinated with Smiley's humane attitude toward her characters (warm, concerned, sympathetic) and her crisp, penetrating writing style. She is one of our best living authors, I think. Readers do not come away with deep ethical/philosophical insights as with books like War and Peace or Crime and Punishment, but with insights and attitudes towards exciting characters that better help us understand and perhaps be amused at human nature. I suppose I like her balance between seriousness and human inher approach to characters.Just for the record, there is nor was there a Safeway in Arcadia when book takes place. Try Pavillon, (closest to tract) or Von's or Ralph's. Who do I write for correction?"
3,Not quite another MOO,"I write as a big fan of Jane Smiley. Her previous novels have. . . . well, nothing short of grandeur. I eagerly looked forward to HORSE HEAVEN, but found the characters were not very finely drawn, nor were the subplots put together with the finesse found in MOO. There's lots to admire here, but the total work drifts here and there. HORSE HEAVEN feels to me like a draft that needs some hard editing."
5,A Book to Re-Read,"I am now re-reading ""Horse Heaven"" (on audio -- so forgive any misspellings). I love this book as much this time as the first and I know I will be reading it again. It will go onto my list of books that periodically require re-reading (Castaneda, Dickens, Austen, Tolstoy are on that list). The horses are as beautifully characterized as the people around them. The last writer to give horses their full due was Jonathan Swift in his Gulliver's Travels to the land of the Houyhnhnms. The book is rife with wonderful characters, humor, satire, drama. Just A Bob is one of the great literary characters of all time but everyone in this book is surprising and moving as Smiley catches each one at some particular moment of evolution or self-realization."
3,You'll need a corral to keep track of the characters,"OK, it was a loving look at the world of thoroughbred horseracing and training and breeding, etc. But there were too many characters and plotlines to follow. On the upside, the horses themselves were marvelously drawn as luminous characters well worth keeping track of. I fell for ""Justa Bob"" and would have kept reading more about him alone!"
1,"Jane is definately not from ""Horse Heaven""","I work in the horse racing industry, and found this book ajoke. I can underline at least one if not two or three sentances outof every page that contains things that just are not right. She portrays the trainers as uneducated, foul-mouthed jerks who resent the fact that women were ever allowed on the backsides of racetracks, and who view the Owners as the enemy. This may be true of a very few trainers in the industry, but certainly not the majority, and certainly not the successfull ones. She offends me often with her vulgarities, and her ""romantic interludes"" are nothing short of pornography. I sent this book to my mother before reading it myself, in hopes of showing her a brighter side of racing and the thoroughbred industry....wow...what a mistake that was. END"
3,Disappointment,"Smiley is one of the most gifted of all writers. Unfortunately,in this book, there appears to be a greater interest in impressing theliterati then communicating with the reader."
5,"Terrific book - beautifully written, funny, poignant",Can't say enough good things about this book. I loved every story line. Smiley's language is so evocative - I drank in each phrase. And I have to admit - I enjoyed Eileen just about as much as the horses. So what if it's a little difficult keeping everyone accounted for - it's worth it!
3,Horsing Around,"I love horses and I love reading but I have to admit that finishing this book was a true challenge! Jane Smiley has a delightful knowledge of both people and horses but trying to tie all these together became an exercise in page turning for me. I had to continue to return to the cast of characters to figure out who was whom. Fewer characters, fewer ""aside"" stories that really did not add to the main one would have made this a completely delightful read. As it is, I can only recommend it to both horse and Jane Smiley fans."
1,long and boring,"i usually never leave a negative review, but i'll make an exception here. i loved the movie, a thousand acres, which motivated me to want to read something by jane smiley. i chose horse heaven because i love horses. i'd read seabiscuit a couple years before horse heaven, and really ejoyed that book. horse heaven, i found, just dragged on and one with a myriad of characters that never developed into anyone that grabbed my interest or concern. i kept thinking it would get better. i plodded on. then it became a goal just to finish what i'd started, but i didn't enjoy it much. i bought thousand acres on dvd becuase the story was touching and realistic, not to mention the acting which was phenomenal. this book was a waste of time and money."
1,Constant run-on,"I enjoyed the first couple of books from this author, but it sounds like she has run out of good ways to write a book. Not since 19th century British lit have I seen someone take so long to say nothing. The story was a great idea, but it was simply executed poorly. This book reads more like contract fulfillment than a true work of heart."
2,Never crossed the finish line,"This is a book that reads like War And Peace at the race track. There are a couple of hundred characters (including the horses) most of which one could care less about or even get to know. This is a textbook on horse management masquerading as a novel. I found the first 200 pages or so to be mildly interesting, even a little funny, and then the whole business comes to a halt. It gets mired in you-know-what. Every page introduces a new horse and more arcane horse jargon that you can live without. After awhile you don't know if the author is talking about a human or a horse and what's more you don't give a hoof."
1,Enough is enough,"This is possibly the most boring, uneventful, horrible book that I have had the misfortune to come across. The endless parade of new characters was mind-numbing and tedious. I didn't care about any of them because Smiley gave you no time to get to know anyone, she was too busy adding someone new. Ho Ho Ice Chill indeed.I feel like writing to Ms. Smiley myself and asking for my money back."
2,Aimless and boring,"This book is aimless and boring. I am on page 243 and I probably will not make it through the entire book. I don't enjoy reading it. The chapters are disjointed and the chapters about one character, in particular, are so poorly written that I have to hold myself back from making snide comments out-loud while my husband is trying to sleep. I'll probably just donate this to the local library. I don't see myself getting to page 300. So disappointing."
5,A wonderful read,"Beautifully written, humane, quirky, and utterly engrossing. I don't know horses from hoarseness, but still was captivated by this novel.I always read for two hours every night in a big armchair and ""Horse Heaven"" was a big treat I looked forward to after a long, hectic day with three kids. Thank you, Jane Smiley, for this superb book."
2,I usually love Smiley,"Although I have been a huge fan of her work in the past, I have to say that this book has been disappointing. Hoping that the confusion with characters and animals would dissipate within a hundred pages, I read on. Unfortunately, the story only got increasingly convoluted and I finally surrendered."
3,Get the horse's perspective,"I don't particularly like horses, but I found this book entertaining. It's basically a story about several horses and people who experience some entertaining events on the road to greater self-knowledge. Some parts are lighthearted and funny, other parts are kind of melancholy. I really liked the horse characters, especially Justa Bob and Mr. T. On the other hand, many of the human characters were boring, selfish, and hard to identify with, the main exception being Rosaling Maybrick, whom I found interesting. The book is too long -- 200 pages could have easily been cut without losing anything. But if you have the time, it's worth reading to get the horse's perspective -- long live Justa Bob!"
1,Horse Heaven,"Horse Heaven is not Jane Smiley at her best. Too many characters poorly developed and no discernable plot. In a single word: disjointed. In three words: disjointed, wordy, dull."
2,NEIGH...NEIGH...,"I can't believe I finally got through this overdone, boring book. I guess if you were one of those people who drew horses during art class in school you might like it. I wasn't one of them. I like Lidie Newton and Moo, but this book??? NEIGH...NEIGH...."
2,This was very boring,"I've read other Jane Smiley works that I've loved (A Thousand Acres, Moo) but I bought this booked based on the positive reviews that I read in Amazon and I must say that this is one of the DULLEST books I've picked up this year. I find myself skimming passages at this point I'm struggling with finishing this. I'm tempted to put it down forever and be done with it. I hate to leave books unread however, so I'm plodding through this boring, thudding tome. There are too many characters to keep track and long long narrative scenes that go nowhere. Yes, there is something satisfying about reading a book that is complete in its coverage of a subject but this is just written in exhaustive detail. Unless you know something about horse racing to begin with, I say bypass this one."
1,A Writer In Search of An Editor,"For anyone who has ever read Jane Smiley, you must know that this book represents one of the worst things she has ever written. Endlessly tangential, wandering stories, endless characters, and pulled together with the most trite of endings-- the very fact that she required a list of characters in the front of the book to explain ""who was what"" says it all. Clearly Ms. Smiley is a major writer, but why didn't some editor have the guts to tell her that what she had turned in was a first draft? I miss the writer who wrote ""A Thousand Acres,"" and find it hard to believe that she and the person who wrote this book are one and the same."
1,It Could Be a Winner in the Bulwer-Lytton Contest,"I was shocked by how bad this book was. Horse Heaven was Reader's Hell. The writer won a Pulitzer Prize? If it was for anything like this book, the folks handing out the Pulitzers need to be slapped.There were sentences so long and straying, they needed to be broken into separate paragraphs. Characters were so sketchy, it was impossible to care about them. My impression was that the writer collected lots of information about horse racing and tried to cram every incident she heard about, and every type of person involved with horse racing, into one book. The result: a preposterous mess. If it were a movie, it would be 4 hours long, and the critics would rip it to shreds.The main thing I got out of it was the realization I had underappreciated the Dick Francis novels I read."
4,Alameda and Contra Costa Counties Street Map Book,"GM Johnson has produced a useful, very reasonably priced map book for these counties. Street detail is very good in the densely populated areas, but is often lacking for those places off-the-beaten-track. Therefore, if you just need to get around the cities and towns, this map is great. However, it is really not sufficient for backroad treks."
5,pure serenity,"I love this cd and as soon as I hear the first chimes, I begin to relax. Perfect relaxion/meditation/I Ching music!!"
1,Namaste I,No he recibido el CD aún. Yo necesito una respuesta: el número de envío y la empresa de correo. Muchas gracias.
1,Would be nice to be able to hear a sample!,"The reviews of this album are great, but I won't buy it unless I can hear a sample. The follow-up Namaste II does allow samples to be played."
3,Namaste CD,I ordered this CD after reading the reviews - disc one was OK but I was not thrilled with the guided meditation on disc two -
2,Truly awful,"This cd is a very disappointing mix of wierd music. The only song worth listening to was the indian chant/flute song, which is hauntingly beautiful, but the others are just plain awful. Don't waste your money."
4,New team for the new millennium!,"This book is about the Omega Force, a team that deals with modern dangers to the U.S. Things like terrorists, Nuclear Weapons, and the Middle East. Unlike some authors, I won't name anyone, who dwell on the Cold War.Each member of the group has a different personality and the team is ethnically diverse. The story shows that the United States government is not infallable and has made mistakes. It might even be, dare I say, corrupt."
3,Psalms,I thought this book gave an outline on the psalms. Will give it another chance and see what happen. I might recommend this book to others.
4,"Not bad, so far","Just out of the box, the display didn't look that great. Then I adjusted the ""focus"" on the screen and it looked a little better. There was a definite alias probelm on the text and icons before I bumped the focus down to 50. The screen definitely has a nice brightness to it and good color.Can't go too wrong for this price.Overall, so far so good."
4,Best Female vocalist Ive ever heard.,"This albumn never got the recognition it should have. Its excellent. A constant in my cd player. Hearing her live is even better, bumping around the Continental, the night cat, and other melbourne sound scenes. Where is the new albumn i ask? ""Im ready!!!"""
1,wrong year on dvd,This is NOT made 1940. This was made around 1947. Even the dvd states this was AFTER WWII.I wish I could get the correct one. I already have 1947 version and the 1952 version.
1,Got an old edition,"When I purchased this item, I was not informed that there was a new edition of the book, I would have preferred to buy the latest ..."
4,unique resource for the technically gifted,"There are several categories of hack in this book; two of them are ""saving money"" (finding ways to work with PDF's outside of Acrobat) and PDF in web design--using CGI scripting to serve up individual pages that have search text for example. A third type of hack are some old-school tricks that help make your PDF's more widely compatible. Good stuff, not crucial unless you happen to need it."
3,good not great,"The towels are very soft and fluffy, but the beige color turns a funny color when washed. The ivory color is fine. The bath towel is very large. I am not overjoyed with the trim. I bought similar ""waterford"" towels, and like the styling better, although the bath towel isn't as large."
2,Disappointing - 1/2 as thick as the body towels,"I ordered the Lenox Platinum body towels and was very happy with the quality. The towels are soft, thick and absorb water well. On the basis of the quality of the body towels, I ordered the ""matching"" wash cloths and hand towels. Both items are about 1/2 the thickness of the body towels and not as soft. I was expecting these items to be of the same quality as the body towels - particularily considering the price! I can heartily recommend the body towels, but do not expect the hand towels and wash cloths to be of the same caliber."
2,So-so Not like the bath towels,"I bought these towels in the hand towel size and the bath towel size--for me a complete set. (I do not use washcloths.) The hand towels--these items--came first and I was disappointed by their lack of thickness. They seem to absorb alright but I was expecting (from other reviews) plush, thick towels. They are rather thin, certainly not thick. Today the bath towels came and they do seem thicker and more like what I expected. A long time ago, I had some Martex towels that were wonderful. I thought these Lennox towels would be like those Martex, but they are not. By the way, I have tried Martex also and have not been able to get what I had that one time. I am into towels and buy a lot of them but have not been systematic enough, perhaps. My search goes on for the plushest!"
4,Lenox Collection,It seemed like a lighter weight terry cloth than the previous Lenox products I've had but was still very good quality.
5,Very Soft,So far this is the softest towel that I have found. It is also good-sized and of heavy construction.
2,MAYBE IT'S ME! I HATE MIND-NUMBING ROMANCE BOOKS...,"THIS WAS THE MOST RIDICULOUS BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I ONLY BOUGHT THE BOOK BECAUSE I WAS BROWSING AND READ THE 5-STAR REVIEWS. THE DIALOGUE WAS LONG-WINDED AND UNFOCUSED AND I ALMOST DIDN'T FINISH THE BOOK ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. I KEPT WAITING AND WAITING FOR IT TO GET BETTER AND IT DIDN'T. THE PLOT SOUNDED SO STUPID, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN! SORRY TO EVERYONE THAT LIKED IT!"
2,What a disappointment,"I bought this book based on the reviews listed with it and because it was listed under the Welsh Corgi books. I found it to be a silly, insipid romance where you knew the ending after the first few pages. Some of the dog characterizations were clever, but not worth reading the rest of the book."
1,AS BLAND AND LUMPY AS UNSWEETENED OATMEAL...,"This story had nothing going for it. I was looking for humor and entertainment and yet what I got was a terribly bland (especially the heroine) experience with no help from the narrator. So much was wrong:--Heroine was beyond blah and too bitter from cheating husband to be interesting (the same husband she ignored for her dogs. That marriage was doomed.)--Cheating best friend was a lifelong self-absorbed twit and should never have been a best friend.--Dog ""angel"" couldn't communicate with heroine, which would have added interest, but could only talk to herself and that became annoying.--Heroine is a photographer and when her car gets broken into and her house is burned down she sees no connection??--Villain was far far too obvious.--Narrator used a blah, meandering voice that made this boring book close to unbearable."
5,"Dog lovers, you're in for a treat.","Do you:(a) Love dogs, in fact, have one or two sleeping around the house even as you read this?(b) Think dogs can actually understand you, and are smarter than everyone else think?(c) Believe in guardian angels looking over us?OK, maybe (c) isn't necessary, but if (a) and (b) describe you perfectly, you're in for a treat. This book is so funny, mainly because Lydia/Miss Piggy is a witty, intelligent, cynical, wry, yet grumpy fat corgi that saves the story from medicrity. The mystery's weak, the heroine does a very stupid thing at the climax, but hey, I am biased. I love dogs. Lydia/Miss Piggy gets a 5 star rating."
5,A gem!,"Finding Mr. Right was howlingly fun! The romance between Amy and Jeff was sweet, but what really set the book apart were Miss Piggy's observations. Piggy is an absolute scream! Try this book... you'll love it. Thanks, Ms. Carmichael... and how about a sequel for Piggy? I'd love to see the little matchmaker in action again."
5,back to the roots,"These guys sound to me like I imagine the Stones would've sounded if they never ''made it"" ,and just went on playing the music they loved, blues. Dick Taylor, the guitarist who originally played with Mick and Keith,(Mick in '57, Keith in '60, the three together in '61) is the guitarist here, (he left the Stones because he didn't want to make a permanent switch to bass to play with Keith and Brian."
5,End Game,"A thought-provoking book that examines the frantic political and diplomatic efforts in three capitals (Moscow, Washington and Tokyo) as World War II closed down. The description and explanation of the race by the USSR to control the Kuril Islands, a strategic area still in dispute today, was especially enlightening to me. While I continue to think Truman's use of the two atomic bombs was more consequential to the political decision of the Japanese elite's accepting of U.S. surrender terms than is the view of Professor Hasegawa, I am convinced by the professor that the concurrent shock impact of Stalin's final military moves is the major key to understanding the ultimate wrenching decision made in Tokyo."
5,Excellent book for the person who likes to draw horses.,Great illustrations in this book. It will make it fun for you to learn to draw horses.
2,below standard,"i'll keep it short. it was a late and though i knew it was used, it was a little too well used, but still usable, so i kept it. but i have much better survice in the past than this."
5,My kids did lots of drawing with this book!,"This book has easy-to-follow pictures on how to draw a perfect horse. They spent hours drawing the different horses in many different ways, such as standing still, gallopping, looking scared, and rearing up. If you have children who love horses, they will love this book! My daughter brought it home from the school library, but I am considering buying this book and one other in the series for Christmas presents!"
3,"Impressive, but lacking...","I personally feel that this book is for the established artist who knows his basic concepts in art. For the newbie, this might not be the one for you. The drawings within are definitely for those of a slightly higher level.However, if you are looking to pratice your equine drawings, this is the way to go. The step-by-step drawings are easily to follow, and the guidelines at the beginning of the book serve as a reminder to improve on your drawing skills.This is truly a good book for practice. If you need the basics, look somewhere else."
2,Not quite what you might think...,"While this book purports to be PA's ritual it certainly is not the current ritual. Some of the words are similar, but it is in no way the current ritual of PA. Either we have changed very drastically in the past hundred and thirty years, or they used a similar jurisdiction's ritual and called it PA's. Personally, I am leaning in that direction having seen a large number of state's rituals. It seems much closer to New Hampshire's than anything else."
3,for dedicated Graham Parker fans,"Graham Parker live solo acoustic a a small club in Tokyo. Obvious highlight: ""Discovering Japan."" Hard to understand the cover choices. Unlikely to win any new converts with this one."
2,Time to get up?,"This is a nice clock, and I really like not having to reset the time, but it has a couple of serious drawbacks. The button used to shut off the alarm is also the button used to set the time of the alarm, therefore when I shut off the alarm in the morning I reset the time it will next go off. This is enough reason for me to use this clock only as a reliable timepiece and another as a wake-up system. The other point that bothers me is the projection of the time onto the wall or ceiling. The ceiling is too far away for me to see without my glasses, which I don't wear to bed. When the wall is used, the number is backward unless the face of the clock is also toward the wall, which makes it inconvenient to see the time on the clock when the lights are on. Aside from these two points, I love this clock."
3,Decent quickstart book,"This is a decent JSP book, but to use it, you'll need to have some prior experience with Java or have another Java reference handy because explainations are brief and not always worded in the best way. I think this book actually serves the purpose of a quick reference better than a tutorial.I like how each topic opens to its own two page section, breaking things down into digestable chunks of information. However, what I find rather annoying is how code is displayed in various stages of being typed. It presents the reader with the rather tedious task of trying to figure out what was added between snapshots of the code in Windows Notepad. To me, it doesn't make sense to have different shots of 15 lines of code progressively being typed out with explainations given for key points within the incomplete code. I would much rather see those 15 lines all at once and read the explainations of the points of interest like every other book does (and for good reason)."
2,Returning my copy!,"Like all the other books in its series, this book is simple and easy to follow. It starts with a brief introduction to Java programming before diving into JSP material. The topics that it covers include: using variables, creating and handling forms, dealing with cookies, adding javabeans, interfacing databases, error handling, custom tags, file handling and servlets.However, it covers each topic ever so briefly, often ignoring critical details that would leave you unable to make your page display at all! For example, in the Javabeans section, the book tells me to look up my web server for where I store Javabeans. Generally, this book follows a narrow track of possibilities and is best utilized as a throw-away training manual."
3,Too Fast for beginner,"This book covers everything too fast. If you already have a good knowlege of Java this book, you will be able to apply your knowledge and learn JSP. Unfortunately I don't know much Java and this book covers the examples so fast, that I have no idea how to apply to my own work. I think I'll wait till the JSP Fast and Easy Web Development book comes out. I have the Coldfusion and PHP books in this series. Both are quite good."
1,Worst book I've ever read,"The 'beginners' are not only the readers of this book, but also the auther & technical support. As other books they've published, it's not for 'beginners'. It's better to use SUN's wesite (which they seem to refer every time they receive questions from readers) than to buy this book."
4,Great book Worth Every Moment,"My Mom handed me this book and said I had to read it. She was right! The story of the Andrews family, their journey to Newfoundland and the village they develop is riveting. We see their story through Vinnie's eyes who is a young teenage girl at the novel's inception. The family endures nature's elements, life and many deaths through the telling of her experiences. I particularly enjoyed the switch at the end when we see things from the eyes of a different but VERY important character. I just ordered the sequel and am looking forward to continuing with them on their journey."
3,Novel of Newfoundland,"I was a bit disappointed in the style of writing. It was all right, but not good enough to interest me in the book."
5,cape random cloned,"I enjoyed Random Passage. I couldn't put it down. Only when I read it, it was called Cape Random. What goes? I actually started to read Random Passage but soon realized that I had already perused these pages as Cape Random"
2,Incredible Hulk meets The Mighty Thor,"David Banner is back trying to ""control the beast that lies within him"". As usual Mr. Mcghee is still trying to find him. Everyone is older and it shows. The problem with this one is that the focus shifts too much towards Thor. A better story would have been better. Plus technology looked better 10 years earlier, you would think that the metamorphisis would look better, but it looks worse. However, if you are a die hard Hulk fan you will want to own this, but you will feel cheated. END"
2,Not what it says it is,"The fan is okay, but there is no ionic function on this thing. It is an overpriced fan (and non-oscillating). It comes with this great filter, but the filter will eventually get dirty, and then what? I'll have to buy another filter from the same company. We were looking for something that had no filters, and was truly an ionic air cleaner that you simply wipe clean. This purchase was a disappointment."
4,The Hamilton Beach True Air 04492 is great!,"The Hamilton Beach True Air 04492 has been working great for me! I have had this air cleaner for almost 4 months and today is the first day I've had to vacuum the filter. It's doing a great job of keeping my bedroom free of air-borne irritants and I sleep so much better now. I keep mine on auto and it's very quiet. In fact, I have to put my hand on it to be sure it's still on and running.I love the slim trim line of this unit. It fits very well in my bedroom without being as intrusive as some other machines I've tried.I'm very satisfied with this air cleaner."
2,Dissapointing,"I've had this for about a month. I was first upset because it doesnt run silently with a static grid like I thought 'Ionic' meant. Alright, no big deal, I usually sleep with a fan on for the white noise anyway.So, right away it tells me my air is clean when it isnt. My room has a lot of dust in the air, and it hurts to breathe when I wake up, and sometimes wakes me when I'm sleeping because my throat gets so dry. After a month of running it on high when I'm out and low when I'm in, my air looks just as dusty and it still hurts to breathe in here.To make matters worse, the seller I got it from only allows returns within a few days of getting it, so I'm stuck with this thing that only seems to make a lot of noise. Maybe in time I'll notice a difference, but so far its done nothing as far as I can tell."
3,Good but loud,I've had mine for a week now and it works good but this baby is loud. If you own a Xbox 360 and you think that's loud then this is even worse. It's not as bad if I have my stereo on or my central air. If you want a nice quiet day at home turn this off. I also started to get a small fan rattle after just a few days. Set up out of the box is easy just remember to take the bag off the filter. I won't buy this style again.
4,Good Product,"It's reasonably quiet and works best in auto mode. It definitely does a better job that my Ionic Pros did. Apparently, you need to move the air to clean it. I use this in my front room which is OA, combining the living room, kitchen and dining room. This unit works much better by itself than the two Ionic Pros that I had in the same room. Note; I did replace those two with this unit and another Hamilton Beach rotating tower fan that has an Ionic air cleaner built in as well. I have no idea how easy it's going to be to clean or get replacement filters for yet though. Providing that goes well, I will definitely get one for every room."
2,"Auto sensor not work properly, it`s so Noise train","There are three problem of the product. Auto sensor does not work properly and there is no auto turn off function, it`s like Noise train, Who say it was quiet? I couldn`t sleep because of it`s noise even whisper(minimum speed) mode.Don`t waste your money and time to return it, and Just one filtered. but that`s a advantage to save money(you don`t need to buy filter again). if you want to buy chip air purifier, it`s one of your solution but if you want real purifier, it`s not good choice."
2,disappointed,Very disappointed about this purchase through Amazon. I have been a buyer for long time. When I received this Item I was so excited. Opened it up and set it in my daughter's room. She has dust allergies. Unit is soo loud she wasn't able to fall asleep. Ran it for minimum 2 hrs. Decided to return it Contacted seller several times and also filed a claim with amazon but because I opened the box to use it so I cann't return it. I will never buy anything from Amazon again because I could have easily bought this item from local store and return it if I wasn't happy with my purchase. If you want to return it don't open the box. That's what the expectation is.
1,purifier,no good at all dont you make my mistake am allergic and this product din't do notting at all for me dont understand why some person do recomend it
5,Earl Thomas Conley Too Many Times,"am rating this cd 5 stars because it is so hard to find.it was used and in great condition..the seller took great care of this and it shows.all the songs are soo good especially dancin with the flame ,many forgiving years,too many times,right from the start etc.etc.etc. thank you amazon.com i can always count on you for the best prices and great sellers too!!! Linda Sue"
2,Everyone is 7 feet tall,"So while they are made of nice material, the XL size is great for a 40-42inch waist but they were so long they needed to be taken in to be hemmed more than a couple of inches for a person who was 5'11"" That was an added expense and delay that was more than anticipated.Still, they function as pants."
1,DONT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE TOOOO LARGE LEGS!,"First of all, I ordered black and they send me navy.Secondly its toooooooooo large on legs. Weist is good. I ordered M and it's much shorter then I expected.Just don't order this pants, unless you have got large legs and you aren't tall."
4,"Nice, but not for cold weather","I love them, they fit great and they're comfortable for working out in. The only thing I notice is the how the wind blows through them, but they are described as MESH so just remember."
4,Very nice track pants,"Great fit, stylish look and comfortable material. The elastic waist is comfortable and the color very nice. They hold up very well to washings also. I have these in black and white also!"
2,Pretty good,"It seems to be good quality but there is no way i would find out how long the pants are gonna be. I wish the seller could mention that for other people to find out. I bought pants from piranhagear and they mention their pants in detail, customer reviews are useful toofor anybody buying a size 36, you need to be 6'10 to wear it"
2,These run REALLY REALLY big,"I ordered these because I was trying to replace a pair of Adidas mesh pants that looked very similar to these. I ordered Medium while my older pants were large. And the pants I got were FAR larger than my Large pants. Both in length and width.I probably would have kept them though if it wasn't for the double-sided glossy mesh fabric. They are two-ply whereas my older pants only had one ply and a cotton-like feeling on the inside. This made them rather uncomfortable and not as flexible, plus they built up an insane amount of static."
2,Size Fitting,"I found generally the quality of the item was very good, but the leg length is far far too long and baggy. I ordered a medium size and if I had purchased locally, I would have asked for a refund. Oh well the problem with purcashing over the internet."
5,adidas,Arrived very quickly and is a quality pants. I wear nothing but Adidas for casual and I am happy to add this product to my collection. I will buy more Adidas garments.
1,Not what I wanted-Not even close.,"If there is such a thing as Irish country music, then this is the worst form of it. I was expecting instrumentals or something appropriate to play at a wedding. There is not one good song on this CD and there is definitely nothing here that can be played at a wedding. The title is definitely misleading."
1,What's up with that?,"I wish I had read the other reviews first. Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes. Obviously, I already know the ending of ""The Black Death"", but I still wanted to see the full show!"
3,Good laughs,"I thought I had to endure 5 minutes of commercials because I rented this DVD, but I guess I won't be buying it simply for that reason and -2 stars! That said...I think Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey's funniest movie since Liar, Liar. His rubberface antics are hilarious, especially when he makes Steve Corell talk gibberish during a newscast. When Bruce Nolan becomes Bruce Almighty, he uses his powers mostly for his own gain but eventually learns he cannot please everybody all the time. Jennifer Aniston is pleasant enough as Bruce's girlfriend and I cried when she prayed to forget him at the end.Truly a cute movie, worthy of 5 stars, but start the DVD 5 minutes before you will actually sit down to watch it"
3,Laugh out loud comedy.,"Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey)is a television reporter in Buffalo, N.Y. He is very unhappy with nearly everything in life despite the love of his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston). At the end of the worst day of his life, Bruce angrily ridicules and rages against God. This time though, God responds and appears in human form (Morgan Freeman) endowing Bruce with divine powers.Bruce then wreaks havoc and is enjoying it. He sabotages the new TV Anchorman and gets his job. Then Bruce realizes that he has to deal with what has got to be God's most arduous task, listening and answering prayers. When he tries to grant everybody what they want, turmoil ensues. While Bruce is getting everything he wants, he has been ignoring his girlfriend, Grace and loses her. It seems that the only thing that he can't do, is alter a person's free will, so if he wants her back, he has to do it the hard way. This was a funny movie, but I'm not a big Jim Carrey fan."
4,The Latest flick for Jim Carrey,"This movie was very brutally short it should have definantly have been longer.He was with Rachel(Jennifer Anniston) and he loved her but he got fired then he found out he could get some powers and play god,so he has things happen like for instance finding Jimmy Hoffa are putting some girls dress up.As I said he should have had his powers for a little Longer this movie is in the long run some what of a dark comedy is modestly good.Acting 8 Story 8 Direction 7 Action 7 Entertainment 8Overall=40/50 nice for 4 stars is somewhat recommended"
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I will tell you why this movie was absolutely terrible...Because they wrote to many lines for Jim Carrey. With Carrey, you just have to let him go out there and do his thing, and then it will be funny...like in Ace Ventura, Dumb and Dumber, and Me Myself and Irene....Those were all hilarious because Carrey was being himself...as for other movies he was good in (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon), those weren't supposed to be comedies!!! Those were serious movies which were really great!!! Not this cr@p!!!This was too written...don't waste your time!!!"
1,Great Movie,"This movie really sucked. It was suppose to be a comedy but it turned into a love story. This has to be one of Jim Carrey's worst movies ever made. I would rather watch the master of disguise than this movie. I mean i don't care about their little love story, i wanted to see comedy. This movie was a waste of my 7 bucks to buy tickets for it. I would think of a movie after seeing it but after seeing this all i thought was i want a refund. I would slap Jim Carrey if i ever met him counting he was in this sucky movie ."
5,great,Awesome service! Arrived quickly and in great shape. Would be happy to do business again with this seller. Thanks
1,The worst ever !!!!!!!!!!!,"I admit that some part of the movie is funny!!!! Will not some, only one scene which is the reporter remote controlling. The rest of the move is worthless to watch. It's waste of time."
3,Carrey really cares,"This isnt a bad liitle movie. Jim Carrey acts up like he always does with his rubber face but he also does some acting too giving the movie have more meaning. At the begining he is berating GOD that his dull life isnt better. GOD comes in and gives him part of his vast powers. At first Carrey does simpilton things like blow up a womens skirt and stuff. But then, he learns of all the needs people have in the world and his life may not be so bad after all. During his change he realizes what he has is pretty good and leads to a nice heartwarming ending. Carrey walks among nature and realizes that he is part of the un-ending cosmos, he dreams of life and love they way they should be and he treats his fellow man as a brother instead of an enemy. This up-lifting movie will bring you to your feet as Jim shows us all that peace,brotherhood and good will reign surpreme the day mankind wakes up. A day when money doesnt rule us - a day when a walk in the park is as valuable as a diamond."
3,Pleasant but uninspired,"This was a letdown for me. I expected more funny parts, but almost all of those are shown in the trailer. Jim Carrey is funny, but in a predictable way. The storyline does not develop the premise very much; it just follows the path of least resistance. Not a stinker, but nothing special. If you want to watch a movie that covers somewhat similar territory far more effectively, rent ""Groundhog Day."""
4,4-1/2 stars -- Almighty good!,"Bruce Almighty is a very interesting and funny movie. Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a newscaster whose life isn't the best, and he keeps complaining that God never gives him any breaks. Thus God (Morgan Freeman) shows up and endows Bruce with his powers, and Bruce uses these powers to his advantage and DISadvantage with hilarious and disastrous results. I knocked off half a star because sometimes the writers tried to get too much out of one joke (particularly when ""God"" is in the newsroom). But that doesn't change the fact that this movie is definitely worth seeing.Anthony Rupert"
3,nothing special but worh watching,"Set in the suburbs of New York City ""Bruce Almighty"" is about a guy named Bruce who (you guessed it) becomes God for a few days. Aside from the awful, cheesy love story about Bruce and his girlfriend Grace, the movie is pretty funny although a tad tedious at times. The acting is pretty ""lame"" when it comes to the chemistry between Grace and Bruce but I wasn't expecting much from Aniston. Don't expect anything deep theologically speaking) but you might get a light-hearted time at the movie theatres (as unenjoyable as it sometimes gets[...]) The humor is mostly slap-stick and over-the-top"
4,Glad I saw it...,"When I first heard of the movie, I thought it would be one where it was ""too"" funny, if you know what I mean and one in which made no sense. I was surprised to find out, however that I really enjoyed it and think that this is one of Jim Carrey's better movies, comparable to Liar Liar and The grinch who Stole Christmas. It's very funny but not ""too funny"", it and it has a very good message.I like Jennifer Aniston as the fiancee and Morgan Freeman as God himself. The movie is about a man who has ""bad luck"" and takes it out on God. God then asks if Bruce Nolan [Jim Carrey's character] can do better and gives Bruce his powers while he takes a little vacation. The best part in the movie is when Bruce makes Evan Baxter, his rival, screw up live on camera.I really enjoyed this movie and if you are a Christian and are doubtful if this is a movie to see, see it because I am and I'm happy how they portrayed everything. See it!"
3,bruce almighty,"was very funny, but then again, its jim carrey. a whimsical take off of ""god"" as he might appear to someone, yet was very believable, also was a very good story & enjoyable to watch, ps great special effects"
3,In Bruce We Trust,"""Bruce Almighty"" is a one-joke movie that glides on the likeability of its star. Jim Carrey proves once again that he is a very gifted performer of physical comedy, and Morgan Freeman is imposing as the Man Upstairs.But the film suffers from a lack of imagination from its screenwriters. There must be thousands of creative paths to take with a premise like this one, but the screenwriters barely scratch the surface of all the possibilities. It felt like the first thoughts in the writers' heads went down onto the paper and then went onto the screen.Also, the movie aims only for belly laughs and doesn't try to be an intelligent or thought-provoking film, like 1977's ""Oh, God!""Even with all its weaknesses, I still enjoyed ""Bruce Almighty"" and laughed a lot. Jim Carrey gives his audience exactly what it wants: a lot of mindless fun."
3,Not funny,"Bruce Almighty is supposed to be funny, but Carrey doesnt delivers. Carrey's juvenile humor has gotten old, and this movie is no exception. The movie is better for its humanity, than for its comedy."
2,Bad Topic,"2/23/05 As a Christian, and not even a fanatic, I still consider actors playing the Part of God"" too wrong..Even with the acting skills of Morgan Freeman and Jim Carrey, I just couldn't fully appreciate the movie. Freeman playing the part of ""GOD"" and handing over the powers temporarily to Bruce(Carrey) had some poignant parts regarding human nature and as usual Carrey redeems himself at the end of the movie (in Liar Liar) he does likewise..it still wasn't enough to make the movie the usual higher rating I'd rate a movie Carrey & Morgan played in."
3,overrated,"i thought it was funny, but not as funny as a lot of people said. worth a rental, but not much more."
2,Not Even Filmed in Buffalo,"I thought that this movie was ok, but I live in Buffalo, NY and I was sadly dissapointed that really the only Buffalo reference was Channel 7, they used a few landscape pictures from Buffalo, but none of the actors were in any scenes that showed the true Buffalo. If you're looking for a good movie that really takes place in Buffalo, I reccomend ""Mana From Heaven"" a very cute and funny movie thats really about Buffalo, it stars many famous actors including the woman who played Tattie on State of Grace!!!!!!"
1,Actually a 1.5 ...,"This movie was really, ...boring. I agree it was funny at the beginning but after it was just boring! I didnt understand when the main plot was actually going to happen because there were little probems everywhere. If they shortneded down the movie or made it less exciting and more focused then maybe I would of enjoyed it because Jim Carrey was awesome in this movie but in my opinion it was a waste of time and money. But, now I know."
4,"Good, cute movie","If you like Carey, you will like this movie.Typical Carey laughs and gags.I must say that Jennifer Aniston was quite good also."
3,Another winner for Jim Carrey.,This is Touched By An Angel meets Jim Carrey. And he does a Mighty fine job with it. He's a bit toned down in this movie but I liked it. Full of good messages but would have been better without the swearing and sexual innuendos.
3,"Almost, but not Quite!","This movie is typical Jim Carrey and is fun to watch, although most of it is totally improbable. Felt the ending did not fit Carrey's character nor the script. It was just too gooey to be believable."
4,I was afraid at first,"Being the religious woman that I am, I was afraid that this movie was going to be blasphemes and insulting. I was pleased that it took the role of God and prayer so seriously and still managed to be funny and heartwarming. I am very happy with this movie. Jim was hyserical (watch the part on the maid of the mist) and Jennifer was adorable (watch the part where she is praying to forget him)."
3,"Really, 3 and a half stars... From a believer","I expected this to be a Hollywood mocking of Christianity as they've been doing for 25 years.It's actually fairly respectful of the REAL important Christian issues (more so than ""Oh God"" was).Suspend your judgement on God giving over His powers to someone like Bruce. It's only a story and it's not a preaching story (for either side). God created us to be creative. As Tolkien can create a universe, so can the writer of this movie. Unless it's completely and intentionally blasphemy (it's not), then we need to judge it based on the story and its respect for what is right and good.The movie shows greed. The movie shows power in the hands of sinful man. The movie shows redemption. It shows these in an enjoyable film. Jim Carrey is not completely over the top in his acting as he usually is.Nobody will be saved by watching this movie. But nobody will sense a mocking of God by watching it either."
3,Bruce Okay,"Not Jim Carrey's best, but a funny movie worth seeing once. Steve Carrell really steals the scenes in my opinion. I preferred Evan Almighty to Bruce Almighty. Have a laugh!"
5,and thats the way the cookie crumbles... Not!,"This movie definatly has a lot of thought put into it and thats what makes it so great :). Totally funny you've got to see it (if u havent already). Probably Jim carey's top work :), as well as Dumb and Dumber and both Ace Vantura's."
3,Dealing With One's Midlife Crisis,Bruce Almighty is an amusing tale of a 40 something man's battle with his midlife crisis. Jim Carrey is quite amusing particualrly in his physical comic style. Morgan Freeman and Jan Aston fill in nicely in supporting roles.The moral of this movie is to not take life so seriously. There can be some joy in handling the lighter side of life. Some moments are a bit disjointed but overall the good outweighs the bad and overdone.
3,Predictable madness.,"Bruce Almighty starring Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, and Morgan Freeman playing God is a funny romp but it is quite formulatic at times. This film is mighty flawed but Carrey's engergtic performance saves this possible train wreck. Aniston has great range as an actress but she seems so out of place in this movie, you just don't believe her in this one. Freeman is brilliant as always but the plot is kinda silly. This one is sorta overrated but entertaining. Decide for yourself."
5,Great Comedy,"This movie is awesome, had me laughing non-stop but at the same time makes you think about life when its over."
2,"Worst Jim Carrey movie since ""The Cable Guy""","I've been a big Jim Carrey fan for a while. He's one of the most naturally funny guys I've ever seen. I mean, come on, he's starred in one of the funniest movies of all time, Dumb and Dumber. Yet I sit here and wonder. . . why is this movie so bad??? It's a good concept for a Jim Carrey movie, but it never follows through. Sure there are a couple (literally) of moments that made me chuckle, but none that made me really laugh hard. Previous Carrey movies such as Liar,Liar proved that Jim could still make hilarious films. Morgan Freeman works for me as God, but I cannot see Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston together . . .EVER. I dunno, maybe its just me, but I just expect more from the comical genius that is Mr. Jim Carrey. Now . . . where's my ""Dumb and Dumber 2""? ..."
3,Yawn!!!,"Watching the commercials for this movie yeah, it seemed funny untill you actually watch the movie. Honestly, in the middle of the film I fell asleep and woke up. Yet I felt I didn't miss anything because it was again pretty predicatable. The ending was badly sappy and unrelistic then again having God's power it unrelistic. Anyways, its just the regular plain ol' jokes."
5,Fun!,"This film was christmas gift to out daughter. Jim Carrey finds himself with all the powers of the Almighty. Through humor and crisis, this dvd gets its point across without suffocating the viewer. (take note of the symbolism of the golden calf during the party scene in the mansion.) I recommend this film to anyone who wants to relax to a fun film and leave the movie thinking a bit. Only one rough word but, given film today, I think the movie gets the job done. Highly recommend!"
4,Great Comedy Pleasure,"This is a gem of a film, and one that I truly enjoyed. The humor was clever, and the role of God, played by Morgan Freeman delightful.My rating would have been 5 stars, but some of their best scenes ended up in special features as deleted scenes. Some of them clearly should have been included in the film, as they were excellent.For simple, enjoyable moving watching pleasure, this is well worth the time to view, and Jim Carrey is believable as a frustrated television reporter who feels his life tends to fail his expectations all too frequently.This is a film I have already watched several times since buying it, and recommend it to my friends, and readers here as a bit of divine delight."
3,Funny but confusing,"Unfortunately the movie seems confusing at times.The film was evidently edited for time, not for continuity, so the viewer is left puzzled about a number of things.Fortunately all is explained in the deleted scenes included in the Bonus Features section of the DVD.A very funny film with a good story, a great cast who almost make up for the discontinuities but because of it's editing, it can't get more than three stars. Editing for continuity to tell the whole story instead of leaving holes here and there would make it much better."
3,Amusing,"This movie wasn't bad. It had kind of a slow start, but later takes off. The story revolves around a man named Bruce who feels like nothing is going his way then suddenly one day gets to meet God (played by Morgan Freeman) who gives Bruce all of his powers. Ok, it's a bit far-fetched the movie actually comes off as pretty funny in places and Jennifer Anniston is great as Bruce's girlfriend. The ending is rather sad and Jm Carrey actually gets to stretch his acting abilities by coming off emotional and does a pretty good job. Overall, a decent comedy. Could've been better and could've been worse. Worth checking out."
5,Great movie,"Love it, it's one of my all time favorites. Funniest movie of all time! Jim Plays part in movie so well."
4,Funny and even a little thought provoking near the end,"I love Morgan Freedman as God, I think he did an excellent job with the role and can see why they would make the continuation with Even Almighty. This movie had it funny moments that you could relate to if you all of a sudden became endowed with the powers of God. I own this movie and it is often picked by others when visiting to watch, and it goes over very well. If you like comedy, this is a good one to own."
2,Not that funny,"I love Jim Carrey. He is one of the only actors that actually makes me laugh. He is very believable in everthing he does and he does it well. However, sometimes it doesn't automatically mean that the movie pertaining to his role will be any good. ie- The awful Cable Guy, Liar Liar, and even Bruce Almighty. It wasn't as bad as the other 2, but it was not that good either. It was barely funny, there were only a couple of really decent sorta funny moments.The story was bland and got very repetetive, very quickly. Jennifer Aniston's character was annoying and did nothing for the film. Jim Carrey sure looked like he was having fun though. His character, while interesting enough, still couldn't really save the movie. Morgan Freeman does a fine job, as usual in his small but important role.If you are looking for effective , funny Jim Carrey comedies, skip this and check out Dumb and Dumber or The Mask. Or, one of Jim's best films out there- The Truman Show."
5,Wonderful,"As a pastor, I had some misgivings before I saw this film. Now, I wish I had seen it long before. It is delightful, hilarious and not at all blasphemous. It is a comedy that actually has some redeeming theological value.The story is of a self absorbed news reporter. When things don't go as he wished, he falls into a theological temper tantrum and calls God out for the injustice he perceives to have been done. God answers the call and teaches the self absorbed idiot a lesson by granting him divine power over a limited area of New York.At first this seems like a lot of fun but it soon becomes apparent that as he gets what he wants, he loses that which he most needs...the love of his long suffering girlfriend.I would never call this a teaching tool but it does have a point and that point is amusingly put. It's a great job."
2,A Great Theme Mismanaged,"We suffered through the first third - a manic, narcissistic romp with an actor who needs to be on some kind of downer. His overwrought style diminishes what might otherwise be a 3 or even 4 star movie. They had a good concept and manage to weave it back in and salvage the story about half way through. Fun if you have time to spare with nothing to do. We had more fun contemplating what they might have done with this movie."
2,Good DVD ruined by advertisements,"""Bruce Almighty"" is another fine effort by Jim Carrey. Anyone who enjoys his work will enjoy this movie. Unfortunately, the DVD edition starts with four minutes of movie trailers. Unlike other DVD's, this one locks out the controls on your player so that you HAVE to watch the trailers before accessing anything else on the disc. You cannot even stop the disc from playing once the trailers start, except by ejecting it. AND, this happens every time you load the disc.This is unacceptable, especially in a medium that normally allows the viewer such varied control over how a movie is presented on their screen. Because of this bone-headed decision by the DVD makers, I cannot recommend you purchase this disk. Indeed, I would encourage anyone else who has purchased this DVD to protest to Universal about this forced advertising. Anyone who pays full price for a new DVD should not have to sit through unwanted advertising to view their purchase."
4,Carrey is back baby!!,"after doing the horrible Grinch and the really good drama Majestic, Carrey is back in the funny shiituff. the beginning is hilarious, without a doubt, where theres the biggest cookie and then where Carrey is running pouring milk into the little kids glasses(uproarous). Morgan Freeman is the man, God who gives Carrey his powers. Jennifer Aniston is great as Carrey's wife. another memorable part is when Carrey gives Aniston the orgasm, funny. another funny scene is when he parts the soup too. Carrey is really good."
4,"Pretty good, but not great.","I enjoyed watching this flick, and it has it's moments. However, I felt that certain scenes were lacking in humor, or not there at all. I'd give this 3 1/2 stars rather than 4. It sometimes seems as though JC is struggling to make his transition from comedy into something more serious here, and that's not a bad thing but it doesn't really work here."
3,Overly Hyped Movie Jim Carry Downfall,Bruce Almighty was to my surprise not as good as everyone thought it would be it had its moments but i mainly sat through the 2 hour movie thinking wheres the punchline ... Jim Carry is a funny person just not that funny in this movie over all i give it three stars because it was somewhat funny and entertaining as well but itsnot really a movie i would want to se twice
1,Good Marketing + Bad Movie = Success,"The reason I did not like the movie was because it was about selfish people. Example: he did not appreciate blood drives until he needed blood, or when they prayed to god for things they were lazy about. Also there were so many plot holes it was crazy. For example he didn't have the power to change freewill, yet he made dog go pee in the bathroom, and on Niagara Falls you could see how low budget that movie had. Compositing was so bad; you could totally see they weren't there. Like in one of the scenes sun was on the wrong side of the character as real lighting design hit his face from the opposite side. It's like there were two sun's in that movie. Also all jokes were way old and plot was so predictable. I mean I could go on for hours. I can't believe this movie made 250 million in the US alone. It just shows power of smart marketing. Those are very smart people from movie company. Whatever!"
3,Funny and promising before it becomes preachy,"Jim Carrey re-unites with his Ace Ventura and Liar, Liar director Tom Shadyac in this farce which was a smash hit and managed to put Carrey back on top after a few mishandled flops. When disgruntled Buffalo reporter Bruce Nolan (Carrey) is granted the powers of God (Morgan Freeman), Bruce Almighty becomes very promising to be off the wall hilarious, but it's funniest moments are before Carrey gets his powers. The film treads on being too preachy towards it's halfway point, which was a major disappointment for me, and Jennifer Aniston's supporting role as Bruce's girlfriend is mainly fluff for an all too predictable ending. Carrey is great though as his usual physical comedic self, and all in all Bruce Almighty is a fair film that Carrey's many fans will no doubt enjoy."
4,"Almost Five stars, good movie","Some of Carrey's movies have been pretty dumb but this one is really entertaining and fun to watch. I've seen it a couple of times and will probably see it again. It is more of a ""Liar Liar"" type movie than one of his wacky type roles, complete with morality plays and questions of life asked and sometimes answered. Freeman does his usual excellent job of acting and adds to the quality of the flick.I give this one a strong recommendation and think it's worth adding to the collection."
4,Jim Carrey is back at what he does best!!,"This movie brings Carrey back to what he does best, making people laugh. He really shines as the down on his luck reporter who gets a chance to use God's powers to change the world. His improvisational skills as an actor is his prized possession. He's is hillarious!! Please view the outtakes and deleted scenes as they are just as funny as the movie itself. Jim Carrey is Canada's finest import next to Molson Canadian beer!"
2,"Fine movie, poor DVD","I recently purchased this DVD, but I am going to return it for one reason -- this is the first DVD that I have owned that has unskippable DVD movie trailers at the beginning. It was bad enough on video-cassettes where you had to fast-forward 5-10 minutes of tape, but on DVD you are now forced to watch them (unless you wish to leave the room). Speak up and let Universal know this is unacceptable -- DO NOT buy this DVD.As for the movie itself, if you like Jim Carrey then you will no doubt enjoy this picture; he hasn't lost a step.."
4,Using Movies for Sunday School,"I used the movie with my senior high church group to talk about how God works and does not work. I used curriculum from Christianity Today for questions. The site is at [...]There is one bedroom scene with Jim Carey & Jennifer Aniston that made me squirm, but the movie is PG-13. Other than this scene, the movie had a number of teachable moments."
3,bruce almighty,was just the disk with out a case. not quite what i was expecting thought i was getting a movie with a case
2,Just not funny,"There were a few moments of laughter, but this came up way short of expectations. Without spoiling anything, all of the scenes regarding his career are pathetic. Poor writing."
2,Bruce AllBoring,"I give this movie 2 stars because it is not nearly as funny the rest of Jim Carrey's movies. I saw this expecting to laugh so much, but was only disappointed.I wasn't too happy about the whole concept of ""playing God"" in the movie in the first place, but I thought Jim Carrey's hilarous on screen persona would overcome that. Boy, was I wrong. I should have slept through this movie, b/c it would've been a better use of my time."
1,Why Oh WHY IS THERE A CITIBANK VISA AD ON THIS DVD?!??!!???,"Very funny movie. Excellent performances, especially Steve Carrell as a scene stealing anchorman, but why oh why does there need to be a friggin' VISA CARD AD under the ""bonus"" features on this DVD?? Why oh why did UNIVERSAL Pictures feel the need to ruin this DVD in such a cheap manner? Who is the brain surgeon in their cheapskate marketing department who thought this was a good idea?? Whoever it was, I guarantee you it was one of those workers parodied in OFFICE SPACE and THE OFFICE. I really feel bad for that cubicle-living pencil pusher."
1,Unskipable comercials,"This DVD has several previews at the beginning that can't be skipped. How many, I couldn't tell you, because I returned it as defective. There's no need to put up with that."
5,Awesome!,"Got this for really cheap, and it came with the original box brand new!!! Perfect buy! A++++"
3,entertaining but a bit biased,"I was a bit disappointed by this one. The film had a nice message, but the ending came across as a bit trite to me.I enjoyed some of the gags, too, but in some spots, Carey's goofiness started to wear a bit thin - something I hadn't previously noticed in his films. It reminded me of Steve Martin in Bringing Down the House. Maybe these guys both need to find a new angle or something."
1,Booooring,"This is yet another lame movie from Carey, who got progressively worse after his brief brillance in ""The Mask"". Assuming you don't find the script downright sacrilegeous, you will still be left indifferent at its utter lack of imagination and the forgetable acting by Carey, Aniston (predictably so) and even Morgan Freeman as an unconvincing God (althoughg even the real God usually has a hard time convincing us). The two or three ""good"" gags you've already seen in the trailer.Strike three for Bruce Almighty."
5,Top-notch flick with a worn out theme,"I hesitate to give this movie 5 stars, but with the likes of films such as 28 Days Later averaging 4 stars, what the heck. It was well worth the price of admission and Jim Carey was back to being his hilarious self. It's not as ""over the top"" as the Pet Detective flicks, but it kept me laughing the duration. The theme is an old one, but Carey puts his own slant on the subject and breathes new life and humor into the subject of getting to know the Creator. Anyone connected with local TV or radio production will find this movie to be right on track when it comes to identifying with the characters. In summation, I would say it's a ""feel good flick"" and a terrifically funny movie."
5,great romantic-comedy,"i loved this movie, bruce the character was sometimes corny, but at other times was hilarious, this movie made ur emotions go up and downvery good movie"
1,Forced Previews,"I do not recommend this or any other DVD distributed by Universal. Universal Studios has a policy of forcing viewers to watch previews BEFORE reaching the main DVD menu. Viewers are unable to hit STOP, MENU, TITLE, etc. This is not a consumer-friendly feature. Universal could easily allow viewers to skip the previews, or watch the previews through a menu option. Instead owners are forced to watch previews and commercials before any ability to play or use other features of the DVD. Too bad, because I liked Bruce Almighty -- but the DVD is worthless."
4,:0),"I enjoy watching this movie, jim carey to me is a great comedy actor, very humorous and funny at times and very much watchable and great to add to your collection...."
3,It's good...ITS GOOOOD.,"I watched this one almost a year ago. I gotta be honest and say that Carrey looked like a moron, like he does in every single movie he makes, it doesn't matter if he does a dramatic movie, he looks like someone who was taken from CHILD SERVICES. He is...special. I liked the movie, but it wasn't that great. The best movie he made, for me, was THE MASK. The was the only movie from Jim Carrey that should get five stars. Anyway...speaking about his movie, than I should say that I didn't like that much like THE MASK. If you want to watch a barely descent movie from CARREY, then watch THE MASK.But, I think this movie is just good. That's the highest word that rates this movie."
3,"""LIAR, LIAR"" MEETS ""THE MAJESTIC"".","After some drama movies, ""Bruce Almighty"" represents the return of Jim Carrey to comedy, although the movie also includes some drama scenes. Directed by Tom Shadyac, who also directed Jim Carrey in ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Liar, Liar"".""Bruce Almighty"" is divided in three parts: the first part introduces Bruce (Jim Carrey) to us, we find out about his job, his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), his dog and his ""bad luck"". The second part is by far, the best of the movie: God (Morgan Freeman) gives to him His powers, and Bruce uses them for his own benefit, this translates in very, very funny scenes and jokes. The third part is the weakest part of the movie: it's packed with sentimentalism and cheesy drama, proper of Adam Sandler's cheap comedies.At the end of the day, ""Bruce Almighty"" is an entertaining movie, like the movies that Jim Carrey used to make in the early 1990s. If you are a Jim Carrey fan, you must see this film. If you hate him, stay away from this movie."
4,Jim Carrey at his finest,"This was an extremely clever idea for a movie. I'm sure you've dreamt about it, or imagined the scenerio in your mind at some point in your life. Great idea by the writers of this movie. Also, nobody in Hollywood could have pulled off playing the main character other than Jim Carrey.This movie had me roaring time and time again. The only problem I had with it was Carrey was a little bit Ace Ventura from time to time. What I mean by that, is he was a little too unrealistic in some of his characters exaggerations. Most of them were really funny, but it was a little much. I don't mean to pick this movie apart because it was great. I hope Carrey sticks to the comedic roles, and doesn't ventura into the other kind of films he's been doing as of late."
3,Standard Jim Carrey flick but there's a message,"I remeber seeing an advance screening of Bruce Almighty back in 2003 and even today after viewing the film again I'm still unsure of my thoughts on the film. The film does have some funny moments but a lot of the jokes are best seen in the trailer. Tom Shadyac, who previously teamed with Jim Carrey for Liar, Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective direction is good as always and Shadyac knows the comedy genre very well. But it seems like in the editing the decided to go back and make the film a little kid friendly. But alas the message in the movie is good and Morgan Freemen and Jennifer Aniston give great supporting perofmances. So my final thoughts on the film are it's a decent movie."
3,"Good acting, but plot has been done too many times....","Although funny in places, and despite excellent performances by Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston, the plot was weak. Bruce gets denied a job he wants, starts feeling sorry for himself for having a mediocre life, and winds out getting a little hand up from God himself; who endows Bruce with all his Godlike powers. Bruce likes using the powers to better his own life, but finds it impossible to meet the prayer demands of the other millions of souls in his hometown alone.The funniest part of the movie is when Bruce takes revenge on the anchorman whose job he wanted, making him speak idiotically and rant and rave on the air. Pretty hilarious.But the plot, while seemingly a great idea, does not have enough gas to fuel an entire movie; leaving us with a sappy, predictable ending and bringing it down to the level of just another movie to rent. Three stars only, worth a rental but not a purchase."
4,Carrey cannot cut it as the big man,"Morgan Freeman is not god so I do not know why he is cast as god. To think Jim Carrey is god is ludicrous because he could not even hold on to Lauren Holly, she dumped him after like 8 months! Good acting by some of the supporting cast like Aniston who had just been dumped by Brangelina, god bless her! You will laugh a lot with this film just take it lightly becuz well, you know Freeman nor Carrey are god."
3,Your average comedy film,"This movie is surprisingly boring for the first 30 minutes of the film, but when Bruce receives his godly powers it gets alot more interesting and funny. I think this movie would of turned out much better if Jim did more comedic antics similar to Ace Ventura. This is a nice family movie that everyone would enjoy. Especially great for Christian Families maybe not too strong of Christians because this movie does act against God and gives him a physical form of a human."
4,From the Gal from Buffalo Herself....,"Well, this movie is definitely full of laughs...especially if you're born and bred in Buffalo, NY. First of all, you can feel for Bruce, seeing as how he works for the most incredibly horrible news station in town! And yes, those are real call letters they use in the movie! They're grainy, corny, and most of all...boring! On top of it, you have Bruce stuck in Buffalo, trying to get ahead, when no one realizes, you CAN'T!Even if there were not direct references in the film to specific locales in the area, I could completely relate the movie to the setting! I have to admit, I even got a few evil chuckles out of the whole thing!In the end, Bruce sees the light, and all is right again. Even if he is stuck in Buffalo...which thank GOD (or Morgan Freeman, your choice) this former Western New Yorker is NOT!!Long live the movie parody!"
2,RUBBER FACE CARREY,"This movie is alright I guess, I guess Im used to Carrey adlibbing and making faces all the time instead of acting. He gains some of GODS power and of course uses it foolishly at first. Then he gets the true meaning of life and becomes a good guy. The transfer on my copy seemed a tad soft and blurry sometimes, but the dts soundtrack I used was great. Not too many extras if your interested."
2,Way Over Hyped,"Everyone raved about this film, I got around to seeing it finally and am wondering what is the big deal...The special effects are fake looking, too much obvious blue screen usage. The newsman Jim Carrey was competing against for anchorman gave the best performance when he freaked out in front of the camera. Jennifer Anniston also gave a good performance, especially when she was asking God to help her get over Jim Carrey, and that she didn't want to hurt anymore...I can relate to that prayer..."
3,"Not Great, Not Bad","Not Great, Not Bad... This movie left you wanting more of what Jim Carey is known for. It has its funny moments but did not deliver 2 hours of fun."
3,think.......,"To think that Stewart was only 21 at the time of the recording boggles the mind to his playing ability. Conceptually, Bill Stewart's approach to this album is inspiring. He takes some great solos, and it is really interesting to compare his playing from this recording at the beginning of his recording career to the stuff he is currently producing. Bill's playing is alot more linear on this album (compared to Pat Metheny Trio, for example), very subdivisional.I personally don't like all the tunes on this disc, but the musicianship demonstrated bridges my personal preferences towards composition.If you dig Bill, buy it."
3,Classic stereo bar,"Well made, but a bit heavy and can collapse when guy lines are under heavy tension (so it is not the best for suspended x/y or ORTF micking techniques--Atlas makes a bar that is better for this). Best for studio use where flexibility is needed."
5,Perfect for my needs,I bought this to hold two shotgun mics for recording video. I have it attached to a mic stand and am able to easily mount and point the mics in the directions I want. I also plan to use it with regular mic's for backup singers when recording my son's music. It seems sturdy enough and I see no issues.It is a simple device and did exactly what it is intended to do.I am very pleased.
1,Painful,"I bought 4pcs of xerox c123 drum and lately i found that 2pcs are bad which shows error message 'replace drum' with blank printout,at first i taught it was printer problem but when i changed another drum out of the batch of 4 it stopped the error message with fine print.It's painful i lost such a huge amount since i placed my order on May 24th,2011 sold by Electronics and its more than 3 months plus now for claims."
4,Vida material fundamentalmente,"Este libro está centrado principalmente en la vida material de los Selk'nam, habitantes de la Tierra del Fuego, centrándose en aspectos como las estrategias adaptativas a las duras condiciones del ambiente fueguino, la alimentación, la caza, la territorialidad. Los aspectos ideológicos no son el tema central de este libro, siendo un bueno complemento el trabajo de Anne Chapman.Muchos de los datos de este libro son de gran utilidad para los arqueólogos."
1,Out of tune!,"I purchased these CD's based upon the previous review and am sorry I did. The singers are out of tune on every song. Seriously, they can not carry a tune. If you are looking for a great CD of nursery rhymes for your little one, you might want to consider those by Susie Tallman. She has a gorgeous voice!"
3,Not bad,"I am not too impressed with his (Tan)teaching style, but this book has alot of various information, which could be very usefull. The book I would consider to be a standard textbook, which is somewhat confusing.[Here is my edit: When I said ""The book I would consider to be a standard textbook,"" What I meant was that the book was standard like so many other math books I have had. This is by no means a bad book, but for me personally, it didn't find the way of educating me enough to suit me. This book could use more steps in teaching the ways of calculas for my liking. Nuff said, sorry for the confusion.]"
2,Dweeb on the Cover,I wasn't too thrilled about taking calculus. The instructions for every chapter are the worst I have read. It takes hieroglyphic code crackers to understand what the book has written.I would not take the class that requires this book because that must mean the teacher you have chosen is also lame.
3,A long wait for the book,Took the longest time ever experienced to get the book. I buy textbooks all the time and never have I waited this long to have it in my hands.
2,toookkk fooorreeevveerrr,"Needed the book way sooner than it arrived, which is why i paid extra for expedited shipping, however the book didn't come till somewhere around 2 and 1/2 to 3 weeks after i ordered it!(and badly needed it) Hellooo.. that's why i paid extra!.. Real awkward-had to borrow the book from some random chick in my class to do the h/w.."
3,College Calculus Courses,This book is all right as a college calculus textbook. I used it for two semesters and found it very helpful.
5,Morrell does it again!,"I have read nearly all of Morrell's books and I can't put them down, especially this one. For Morrell to get a totally hyper person like me to sit down and read this book through and not want to put it down at supper (I never skip spaghetti), it had to be good and it was.The downside to the book, I missed spaghetti. I warn you never, I mean never read this near dinner when it is your favorite food, you'll go to bed hungry."
2,Overly boring,"First the book'll hook you up thinking that you'll read about some ruins in Yucatan. Then the main story changes to show us that the best US's spy just made mistake by mistake and they let him being a spy even if everybody knows all of his names. The book is too repetitive about how Buchanan changes his name and someone finds out his new name, made one mistake and one error until he blundered almost everything, but he is the only one to save his own situation. Meanwhile the book leaves you to nothing really interesting. Sincerely is a waste of time and trees."
5,A Definite Winner!!!,"I've never been the type to read a lot of ""spy"" novels before, but I was constantly hearing such good things about David Morrell that I finally went to the library and checked out Assumed Identity. I'm glad I did!This was probably one of the best books I have read in the last year. If they decide to make a movie of this, I'm there. I'm not gonna go into all the details, but if you are at all interested in this genre, check this book out. Non-stop action, exciting characters, many locations they visit, it makes you feel like you are right there with Buchanan the whole time. Buy this Book!!!"
1,This review refers to the audio cassette version.,"It was tough trying to figure out what this story was really all about. Brendan Buchanan has so many different aliases it was difficult to decide who he was at any one time in the story. Ed Asner does the reading, and I wasn't thrilled with his voice, it sounded very throaty and clogged. Our protagonist's aliases are discovered at a cafe in Cancun Mexico, and at that point he remains in mortal danger for the rest of the story, never sure who to trust, even the members of the operations unit he works for. Despite lots of action and plot twists, what I think the story really was about goes deeper: Brendan Buchanan must unmask his own layers upon layers of aliases to discover who he really is, and in doing so, he falls in love, and must admit to himself he is, after all, just one person."
3,There is better . .,"Assumed Identity draws you in, keeps you reading, and then drops you off. The first two-thirds are great and moderately believeable. The conclusion was entirely absurd! Plot development is initiated for some characters and then just dropped. No conclusion or follow-up. Buchanan (the lead character) takes a beating that no man could withstand. Not even in fiction! Close to the conclusion, he says that he has been working undercover so long that he is not in the best shape. Then how can he take the beating he has gotten throughout the entire book. If you have nothing else to read, then pick this up. The Fifth Profession was MUCH better."
2,Why a love affair?,"The book, which is really a good old page-turner, has a lot of action. In my opinion Morrell thinks his readers are not intelligent because he explains the acts of Buchanan - the leading character of the story - too much. You don't have to explain me that you're using a damper on your gun to avoid bystanders hearing your shots. On top of it all Buchanan sleeps with a woman. This fact is totally useless for the plot. Does it really attracts readers of this genre that the action hero conqueres a woman as well? Not this reader."
2,"Good, but not his best","Not a total waste of time, but he has written better books. The action is forced, the characters are under-developed, and the conclusion is totally absurd. Stick with ""Brotherhood of the Rose"" or ""Fraternity of the Stone."""
5,Great Resource,This is a great resource for those interested in being a published writer or illustrator! Thanks~
1,This belt does NOT fit the TDI engine,This belt will not fit your 1.9L TDI engine. You need the xx242 belt.I have no other comments on the belt or its quality; simply that it is miscategorized.
4,Like a soothing bath for the soul.,"My very favorite piece is the last: ""Sirens"", from 'The Crash and the Call', to 'The Farewell', it's tenderness and beauty made my heart ache for more and more. I could all but see the scene unfolding before me, and its bittersweet sadness kept me hitting the replay button time after time just to torture the romantic in me who needs the happy ending."
4,One of my favorite of the Fresh Aire series.,This is a great CD to sit back and relax too. You almost feel like you have been transported back to ancient times.
3,Nice lemony scent,I'm kindda in the middle of liking and disliking it. I like it when worn during the day specially during summer. But I wont dare wear it at night. The lemony scent really stand alot.
2,"Go with Lacoste ""essential""","Just wanted to add my thoughts to the rather sparse reviews here. Lately I've purchased quite a few colognes. Three of which were made by Lacoste: Booster, Essential, and Elegant. I liked the latter two, but am not too fond of the product listed here.A reviewer mentioned minty. I would agree, but add the distinct scent of alcohol and perhaps a little of whatever comes in ""Raid"" bugspray.Now with that said, I absolutely love ""Essential"" (and so do several ladies I know, one of whom gave it to me.) Essential is fresh and clean, a nice summer scent.Lacoste ""Elegant"" is also nice, but has that sort of powdery scent that may not be attractive to the younger crowd. Somehow it is just a little too ""mature"" for me. I still like it and will undoubtedly get some use out of it, but if you can only pick one. . ."
4,My daughter loves it!,I was initially worried about her safety on this motorized bike but she can keep her balance easily and puts up no complaints in wearing her helmet when she has so much fun riding!
4,Amazon came through,"I was very worried about ordering this item for Christmas for my daughter -- it was all she wanted, what if it did not come, what if it was the wrong color. Well, it came faster than expected, it was the perfect color and she just LOVES it. AMAZON is the most reliable source for the holidays!!"
2,Our razor arrived with a flat rear tire!!,Our razor arrived yesterday and when we opened the box the rear tire is flat. It has never been ridden and appears to have a slit in the tire. This is our 3rd razor pocket mod so we know what we are talking about. We are going to try to take it to a service center but are concerned about cost!!
1,missing part,This product was shipped with a hole in the box. Opened to put together and low and behold no video and no wedge for the handle bars. Daughter very disappointed and has to wait on the part from Razor in California.
4,Makes the neighborhood kids envious,"My daughter saved up for months and couldn't be more pleased with her little ""Italian"" scooter. It arrived promptly, was easy to set up, and she was zipping up and down the sidewalk in no time. My only problem: now her younger brother wants one!"
4,Thumbs Up!,This is a great product! I ordered it online (got free shipping) and it was at my house in a matter of days. This was a birthday present for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! It was easy to put together and does everything it promises to do. Extra bonus: it came fully charged. No anxiously awaiting the battery to charge. I highly recommend this for any child in the 10+ range even though the age says 12+ My daughter is 10 and can easily navigate it safely. Thanks Razor!
2,HATE I PURCHASED THIS,WHEN I PURCHASED THIS MOPAD I RECEIVED IT ON A FLAT WITH A WHOLE IN THE BACK TIRE. IT COSTED ME $25.00 FOR A NEW REAR TIRE.
1,"Slow, Boring, And FAKE","This Scooter Is TOO Over Priced, It Goes So Slow That You Can WALK Faster Than It, The ""Lights"" Are Just Reflectors, And The Seat Storage Can Barely Fit A Thin Book, Razor Is A Money Machine, Trying To Overprice You With Cheap Scooters That Go 10 Miles Per Hour, And ANYONE Can Steal It, It Dosen't Even Have A Key! Just An On An Off Switch, I Got A Scooter Thats Bigger, Faster, Electric, Has A Horn, Key, Lights, Brake Lights, Blinkers, And A HUGE Storage For Around $250, This One Is E-X-P-E-N-S-I-V-E"
4,girls love it!,my girls got this for thier birthday and christmas. they love it. they had outgrown the cars. only downside is it is really fast and they must have balance. my girls are 7 and 11.
4,Betty Pocket Mod by Razor,"My Daughter loves this thing. She will go out into the cold, just for a quick ride. Make sure to keep the battery charged and the switch turned off while not in use. I also bought the Hot Mod for my son, same story. If you have a child that loves to be outside when they can be I would definitely suggest buying one of these."
5,RAZOR does it again!,"I cannot say enough great things about the Vapor - this was the hit of Christmas for my 8 year old! We got the Razor dune buggy last year but this ""moped"" even tops it! Very happy with the quality of this Razor product - I definitely rate it tops - perfect for 7 yrs and up!"
5,Black razor moped,Excellent product and safe. We got the razor for our 10 year old daughter for Christmas and we are very pleased. It is her favorite gift.
4,Razor Pocket Mod,"Outstanding Gift...much better quality than expected...no problems yet, only thing is it only holds a 30 minute charge and then has to be recharged for another 12 hours..most kids like to ride longer than that, but all in all this is a very good product.."
3,problem tire,"I bought this for my son for christmas. He enjoyed it very much until the tire popped. I have looked all over and no one seems to sell a replacement tire or even parts in general. To buy this for a 12 year old and not expect some repairs is not reasonable, but to expect to be able to buy the parts is very reasonable."
5,Grandchildren love it!!!,My Daughter and her children moved to Chicago and I wanted to getsomething for them to do here and the razor was perfect.
5,Great Product!,"We bought this scooter for my 10 year old. She absolutely loves it!! There was very minimal assembly and it just plugs right into the wall to charge, no battery's to deal with. It is loads of fun and has become a family favorite toy!"
5,Fun Fun Fun,"I bought this for my daughter thinking it was a great alternative to a mini bike due to enrvironmental and safety concerns. I was right on the money with this. She loves it. I wish I had one as a kid to go along with my bike with the banana seat and my Big Wheel, both of which I loved, too."
1,Razor rocket,My daughter waited on Christmas day 16 hours for it to get done charging. When it was complete we pumped up the tires just to figure out that one of the tires had a hole in it and she still couldn't ride it. So she did not get to enjoy her only Christmas present this year. Two days later we are still unable to find a tube for her tire at any stores around our house. So our only option is to send the whole bike back to amazon which means that she is going to be without her Christmas present for at least another week. So we are going to have to pay $25 extra online to find a new tube. I am frustrated that we have to pay for a tube on top of already paying for the razor. I am very disappointed.
2,Left Us Flat,"Purchased as a secret Christmas gift. Assembled Christmas Eve only to find the rear tire was flat. The factory assembler had pinched the tube when installing the tire and didn't bother to fix it. How did it pass final QA? Otherwise, it looked really good. Too bad it can't be ridden until I can find a replacement tube. Daughter is none too happy this Christmas."
3,Flat Tire out of Box!,"So I thought I was being proactive in getting the BIG xmas gift ready a week in advance rather than the night before and low and behold, it has a blown rear tire! SO disappointing for a $200+ item. Based on the fact that there are other reviews experiencing the same problem, I'm surprised they don't do a final check to make sure the tubes aren't flat prior to shipping. Also disappointing that a week before xmas Razor customer service doesn't have weekend coverage to address these issues. I guess I'll be headed to the bike shop to fix my flat myself."
3,Ok,I'm ten years old and I am so excited to get my scooter!!! I just got it and everything as in putting it together went fine untill iRazor Pocket Mod Miniature Euro Electric Scooterrealized the handlebars were much higher then they should be. I tried to push them down but I couldn't. It was very frustrating!!Now my family is trying to figure it out! I'll right when (if) I drive it.
1,Terrible product from Razor,"Amazon was great- but buyer beware Razor is not. The scooter came in and never worked, it was most likely a bad battery. Called Razor to get the new battery and now it is 3 months later and Razor still has not shipped us the new battery. Called several times got a million different excuses but never a battery. I am not sure how a company can get away with this. So I have to give them the lowest possible rating. Not to mention how sad it made my nine year old. We have just returned the scooter to Amazon and I hope they give us credit. Do yourself a favor and go with a gas powered not this piece of junk"
3,You decide,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It does go fast right after being charged but it doesn't hold a charge for longer then 10-15 minutes at a time. It does recharge again quickly but it only goes fast for about 5 minutes as the charge weakens the scooter slows down. My daughter still loves it and does not mind waiting for it to charge again.
1,"Cute, But Not Good","This product is a big disappointment to my child. The battery does not work more than 10 minutes. The scooter cannot go up small inclines. My daughter fail off the scooter because the battery died out. Worse of all, RAZOR USA does not stand behind its products. This company has had several recalls (see Consumer Product Safety Commission, a Federal Agency). Cute, but not a smart purchase."
5,Fun,We purchased this Razor Pocket Mod for our daughter's 7th birthday. We live on a court with 12 other children between the ages of 7 and 15. They all want one for x-mas. It is great fun for young and old. We found the speed to be just fast enough and it is not hard to control at all. We were a bit nervous to purchase this item but are SO happy we did. Shipping was super fast (box is huge)and it took us 5-10 minutes to put together. We also won a red electric stand up razor scooter shortly after our purchase. The kids by far enjoy the pocket mod more.
5,NBR***Nothing But Razor!!***,"We bought the pink razor (bella) a year ago and our kids absolutely love it!! Just got ""betty"" for our 8 year old's bday. Last weeek we got the E300S and that's been a hit as well. Easy to assemble, extremely easy to learn to ride. They say ages 14+, but our 8 year old has no problem riding. We have 4 daughters and they love them all!Razor makes a great product!"
5,hot mod,Got this for my daughters 10th b-day she handled it just fine. The battery life has been very good she rides it off and on all day.
2,Battery Issue,"We purchased this item along with the 2 year extended warranty for Christmas in 2009. After 10 months the $50 battery had to be replaced, the battery is not covered under warranty. The battery had been overcharged. After speaking with the warranty people and reviewing the paperwork that came with the scooter, we saw that the instructions said to unplug after charging for 8 hours. Obviously, if we had read the instructions the battery wouldn't have been ruined. However, for an item this expensive I think it is unacceptable that it doesn't have an auto shutoff feature when it becomes fully charged. We have purchased two less expensive battery operated vehicles that have lasted for over 3 years and we don't unplug them after 8 hours. Don't waste your money unless you can remember to unplug it everytime it needs charging (which is pretty much everytime your kid rides it)."
4,Scootering fun for kids!,"Update: 2010: We purchased another battery and that helped immensely with the power of the scooter. In addition, she is obviously able to ride it longer before it quits. I read online that some of the original batteries have this problem... Original review: This scooter is ""awesome"" and ""great fun"", according to my 10-1/2 year old daughter. This scooter is great on level surfaces - we live in a somewhat hilly neighborhood and sometimes the scooter needs a little assist to get up the hill, especially when the battery has lost a little oomph. The battery does not have a long life if continually ridden (around 30 minutes), which can be good and bad - bad in that my daughter does not get to ride it for a long time but good in that she will then hop on her bicycle and get some real exercise, ha, ha. Definitely worth the price and really, don't you wish you had one when you were a kid?!"
4,Razor scooter (Vapor),Package arrived right on schedule as promised. The scooter went together with ease. All the required tools were provided with the scooter. This was a 15 minute project to have up and running. The detail is great on this little bike. Too bad the head lamps and tail lamps are not functional. That would have been a great safety feature. My 10 year old daughter loves the scooter and it was the perfect size for her to ride at least for a couple of years.Quality product.
5,GREAT !! GREAT !!,"Have purchased 2 of these for Christmas for my grandchildren. My husband has already put them together , very nice quality.He tested the speed, and they are quite zippy."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"I purchased this item for my 8 year old daughter and she loves it. It has some pep to it so make sure that your child is capable of handling it. My daughter was a little nervous the first go, but got the hang of it quite quickly. It it well built, sturdy, and definately worth the money."
4,fun fun fun!,We got this scooter for my 9 year old for the holidays and she absolutely loves it! Very peppy and attractive too ride! All her friends in the neighborhood now want one too! She cant wait to ride it every day. Very nice for the price. We wish the headlight really worked it doesn't. Also the battery should last longer about 45 minutes with continuous use. But well worth the price as she is enjoying it so much!
5,Betty Boop,My daughter says it is the best thing she has ever riden. She just wishes that the battery would last longer. She is 10 years old and her Barbie Jeep lasts longer than this bettery. Other than that she loves it.I would buy it again without hisitation.
3,Has a Flat Tire,"The brand new scooter is just sitting idle in my basement. I bought it for my daughter's birthday and had it all ready but when she got ready to ride it, we saw a flat tire. The customer service asked me to send an email and hopefully receive a replacement in 7 days.I wish somebody would have checked this before shipping it."
5,100 stars if i could,okay this is a great item because when it came it looked pretty hard to put together but it was a little hard to put it together so we took it to my father inlaw and he put it togther and my daugther could'nt keep away from it she asks me to ride it every day she rushes so much that se is already dressed at 5 in the morning but it does not have a light so don't ride it at night you have to get yoused to it before you ride it in the street it is a reely great item.
3,Razor Pocket Mod Scooter,"This is a very cute and fun scooter. The only thing we do not enjoy about it is that the battery runs out quickly. Unlike the Fisher Price battery operated cars etc which last for several days on a single charge, the scooter battery runs about 15 minutes then has to be fully charged again. But over all my daughter enjoys it. Just wish it would run longer so she could ride longer with her little sisters."
3,Good Fun,"This vehicle has been a hit with my seven year-old daughter, wife, and me as well. My daughter is still learning how to fly solo, but shouldn't have any problems after a second training round.The scooter arrived with air in the back tire, and a flat front tire. The front tire goes flat three days after filling, and will have to be replaced. It would have been nice if the front inner-tube was not defective.The drive mechanism is quite noisy at top speed, and sounds a bit like a coffee grinder. I am fearful it will explode into hundreds of tiny pieces some day.Despite the inner-tube problem and drive mechanism noise, I do not regret this purchase, and consider this purchase a good value."
1,Stopped working December 26th...,"We bought this beautiful scooter for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas and it worked great, for one day. When I called customer service I found out that they do not have any authorized warranty service locations in the entire metro Atlanta area. The closest is about 1.5 hours from here. Big, big mistake. I feel like an idiot."
5,Great gift for tween girl,I purchased this scooter for my 11 yr old daughters birthday. She said it was the best gift she ever received! Beautiful purple color and was very easy to assemble. Only took my hubby about 15 mins.
5,Love at First Ride,"Bought this for my 12 year old daughter. She already had a Razor electric scooter that you stand up on, but we had issues with the battery not holding the charge more than 10 or 15 min. This scooter has been GREAT! Often more than 45 min of riding (my daughter weighs about 90 pounds). WARNING: this scooter moves pretty quickly. Not for a young child!! But, for a tweenage girl, it is apparently the perfect gift!!"
4,Razor Pocket Mod (Sweet Pea),"We bought this for our 8 year old and she loves it. When we recieved it the box was damaged, but the contents still were intact. It didn't take much to put it together according to my significant other and it seems to be waring without concerns. The charge last long enough for you to be outside to watch them on it and not to long so that you feel like you are outside for ever."
2,RAZOR BETTY,Came in with a cracked quarter panel and a dead battery. Razor replaced both for free. 5 stars for razor; 2 stars for amazon.
1,Battery can be an issue,"We ordered this product for our daughter for Christmas. After hopping on the scooter and taking off, it slowed to a stop after only one minute of ride time. We discovered from others that the battery is often an issue with this product.After discussing with Customer Service at Razor, they agreed to ship another battery free of charge in 5-7 business days. However, after three weeks and we still hadn't received the battery, we called Customer Service back. They had no record of our order. We had to place the order again and wait another 5-7 business days... and can only hope that we will get it this time and that it will resolve the problem.Three weeks after Santa Claus brought the scooter, it is still useless."
2,Razor Pocket Mod not as Advertised,"After buying two razor scooters for Christmas, I am very disappointed in the end result. The battery life on one pocket mod is only 5 minutes and then it putters out. Apparently, this is a problem for Razor as they have easily found information on their website. Why don't they send out a quality product to begin with rather than having customers tell excited kids, ""Sorry, we'll have to get another battery because this one is broken."" This is a poor way to run a a business!"
5,My daughter loved it!,My 10 year old daughter was so excited when she got this scooter for Christmas this year. It has been great and I know she will enjoy it even more when the weather warms up. Easy assembly and so far the battery has been fine. We have lots of hills around our home and she gets around just fine. Great product and so so cute!
5,Razor Pocket Mod is Great,"My five year old got this for Christmas and she loves it! She can ride a bike and has been doing so without training wheels for a couple of years now but I was worried about her not being able to control the 15 mph speed. It took her about 3 days to get used to it but now she rides around our neighborhood with ease. She's on the smaller side as well and the only issue is parking it on her own and using the kick stand which is a little difficult to work. I can ride it too! Great price, great toy and easy to put together. Took my husband about 10 minutes. I would recommend for any child over five who is confident on a bike."
4,My Daughter Loves her Scooter!,"We purchased this for Christmas for our daughter and when she saw it she screamed. We wasn't too sure if this was worth the money so we prolonged the purchase for several years. Well, mostly because we thought she was too young and now at 9, she's at a perfect age for this scooter. We charged it the night before and it was fully ready by time Christmas morning came. She immediately wanted to take it outside and for some reason, today's weather was on the mild side. She rode and rode and rode and yelled and smiled and yelled and smiled. The only problem or I guess ""wish"" I have is I wish it was taller since she's pretty tall for her age. She may only be able to ride it this year and possibly next; which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
3,All good until you need a new tire,"My daughter loves her scooter...it was easy to put the front tire on but wait until your rear tire needs replacing and you will be regretting your purchase. No bike shops around us, or motorcycle shops will touch it - they are not insured. So check around you, perhaps you can find a shop to di it, if not, buyer beware. It is a bear to get to the wheel, although it does come with directions. Once you acheive getting the tire off the scooter - it is extremely difficult to get the outer tire off the rim w/o damaging the rim or outer tire.Really fun toy - but maintenance is difficult."
5,Great fun for the grandkids...,"My grandchildren love this scooter in fact they now have two of them, one pink and the other one black. Great for girls and boys..."
3,Safety issues,"I bought this for my almost 12 year old. The product states it is for a 13 year old but it is small and would really fit an 8 year old except that it goes too fast. The product is very cute and took less than 10 minutes to get assembled out of the box. However, it came with a big crack in the plastic and getting a person to talk to at Razor has yet to happen (I gave up after over 15 minutes of being on hold). We've purchased a flag so other motorists can see it as you ride very close to the ground. The front looks like it has a light but it is fake. We plan to change that, again for safety. It is a toy more than a mode of transportation."
4,Definitely enjoyable for the kids,"What a winner for a Christmas present!! I brought 2 of these, and they both were a big hit w/the kids. I have one 9 year old & one 11 yr old and both seems to enjoy the scooter to the upmost. Now, the only problem I'm running into is that one kid thinks hers is faster than the other. Other than that, they love them! By the way, they very easy to assemble too."
2,I've seen better,"If you're really considering this thing, you should check out the Super Turbo 800watt Elite 36v Electric Scooter also on Amazon. It is way better in every respect... speed, battery life, durability, build quality.This scooter is cheaper because it is built cheaply. It does not last as long, has nonexistent support, and sad build quality."
5,fabulous,"got this for my daughters 8th birthday she loves it, all her siblings love it , all her friends love it, all the teens in the neighborhood love it, all the grown ups that seen it love it, it rides wonderful it looks even better, we had hers customized for her only and had a matching helmet made for her to die for cute"
4,My Dghtr loves it!,"We bought this product for my 9 year old daughter. It required next to no assembly, which was great. The scooter is easy to use, both gas and hand brake. We were able to ride the item longer than expected after fully charging the battery once. However, it would be better if the charge lasted more than 30 minutes (takes at least 12 hours to charge the battery). The scooter is pretty in color and style. Glad we made this purchase.Razor Pocket Mod - Betty"
1,Piece of crap.,"These are junk, they don't last long, please don't waste your money, hate I had to give it a 1 star."
1,Beware,"I wish I read the reviews before I bought the pocket mod. My husband went to put it together on Christmas eve morning. The tire would not hold air, he took it to 5 stores and nobody could fix it. The day after christmas, I spent 6 hours trying to get a hold of the company, finally after busy signals and long wait times I got them. First they told me 7-10 days and I would have to pay for the tire. Even though it has never left my basement. I finally got a supervisor and he told me that he would send it out and I would recieve it in 3 days. 5 days later still no tire and the company is closed for the holiday. The company does not stand behind anything and it takes days to get a hold of anyone. Please consider this before you deal with a disappointed child like I have to."
5,Happy birthday,"This is the best scooter. A gift for my 8 year old, but, my thirteen year old and eleven year old LOVE it. I even took it for a ride. It's a great item."
4,DAUGHTER LOVES IT!!,"GREAT TOY FOR MY DAUGHTER. SHE IS 9 YEARS OLD AND TOOK 5 MIN. TO GET USED TO IT. I WENT FOR A 4 MILE JOG WITH MY DAUGHTER RIDING HER SCOOTER. TO MY SURPRISE, SHE KEPT UP WITH ME THE ENTIRE TIME EVEN GOING UP SOME FAIRLY STEEP HILLS.DON'T HESITATE IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT GETTING THIS. YOU WILL ONLY HOLD OUT ON GIVING YOUR KIDS LOTS OF FUN!!"
5,"Great bike, easy to handle and light weight.","Given that it snowed for Christmas and the bike just came out of the box, our kid rode this bike around the house without incident. Her first electric scooter and the walls, wood floors, fine furniture and even the bike remained unscuffed. Easy riding, lots of fun and assembly was a cinch. While most of the acents are decorative only (i.e., lights), the seat does open for storage which my daughter claims will hold her pool towel and snacks for picnics."
4,As Expected,Delivered as expected. Condition as expected. The 11 and 8 year old girls were so very happy and made for a wonderful Christmas!
3,Razor Pocket loses charge too easily,"I purchased a black one for my 8 yr old son for Xmas. Good size, comfortable, but it loses its charge after 15 minutes of riding. Also, we purchased 2 more exact ones for our daughters in lavender. One lasts longer than the other and one goes slower than the other. Inconsistent. But they all have fun on them."
5,Cute and worth the money,"We purchased this scooter for our 5 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it!! We charged the battery the day before so that it would be ready for her on Christmas morning. It's a good thing we did....she couldn't wait to get it outside. The scooter was very easy to assemble and the motor isn't loud at all. The pink scooter, pink streamers and ""sweet pea"" license plate made this perfect for our ""pink loving"" granddaughter. I would definitely recommend this!"
1,2 for Christmas,"I bought 2 of them for my daughters, ages 10 and 6. They were thrilled to see them in the family room on Christmas morning; a complete surprise. I following the instructions to a T: tire pressure, break pressure, chain tension, and charging time. After an initial charge of 8 hours per instructions (although the green light on the charger came on after 20 minutes), the scooters probably never peaked at 8mph and lasted a whopping 5 minutes! Customer service offered 2 new batteries since I called within the 90 day warranty period (mind you, one was purchased about 2 months before Christmas). Customer service said if I accepted the new batteries, I couldn't return the item.We took them back to Walmart. While waiting in the return line, a woman told my wife that we were lucky to return them. Her's was in her closet collecting dust as shipping cost too much for her to return hers. Same problem - NO BATTERY LIFE!"
1,Not more delays in the delivery date!,"I hope you make until the impossible thing to deliver the product (""Razor Pocket Mod -Betty-"") in the estimated arrival date!.When I bought the product I trusted estimated date of shipping, reason why I supposed it would be deliver in the following days to this date... But you don't carry out the expectations and you inform me once and another time new arrival dates. It is not possible, that is unacceptable!."
3,Not Perfect,"I ordered this scooter for my daughter's birthday. It is red, but the left rear quarter panel is all faded pink! Not happy with the condition I received it, when it was supposed to be brand new!"
2,Disappointed,We bought this scooter for our granddaughter for Christmas last year and in less than 9 months with very little usage the scooter no longer works. It appears to be the motor. She loved ridding it when she came to our home to visit and she is very disappointed when she sees it just sitting in our garage. I feel it was too expensive for the amount of enjoyment she had from the scooter. We also purchased a Razon dirt bike for our grandson which worked for all of one day. Razor did replace the broken part but this excited child had to wait for 10 days before being able to ride his dirt bike again. And guess what - the same part broke a second time with another 10 wait. All of this within about a month. Two bad experiences with poor and over priced products. Very disappointing!
4,Razor Scooter,"My daughter absolutely loves her scooter. The body is all plastic, and the box arrived damaged. Some of the plastic was cracked. I called the company and they sent some of the replacement parts. I will be calling them again to get the parts they missed. (I was very specific in the parts I needed, yet they sent some of the wrong ones.) Razor was very receptive to fixing the problem, though.Overall, it was exactly what my daughter wanted for Christmas, and she is thrilled with it."
4,Great ride for price,"Smooth exceleration and ride. Just right power for quick ride around a few blocks. Child likes red/black color as looks ""more grown up"","
3,Alright,Daughter loves it. The front was scuffed. We are waiting for company to contact us. Hopefully a replacement part can be sent.
3,Still working years later,I bought this 7yrs. ago (It's little green but same as what is pic.) I love this thing however about a year after I got it the kick stand broke then it stopped working. I gave it to my dad and he fixed it for me (even super charged it lol) ever since he fixed it I have had no problems with it. I gave it 3 stars because not only did it break and kick stand broke but I hate that I have to leave it plugged in outside or wheel it into the house to charge it. I also have a power wheels 4 wheeler and the battery comes out of it which makes it much easier on me. I'd rather carry a battery inside that leave it out all night. I do like however that since we have a 4 wheeler and this I can ride on this on walks when the kids are riding on the 4wheeler. Lol I know stange but i'm a big kid at heart. By the way I weigh 100pounds so that will give you and idea of what this thing can hold weight wise.
2,Razor-Worst customer service,I ordered for my daughters bday. I put together and charged per instructions. It seemed to work but only for about 10seconds. The charger is apparently defective. Amazon was great to work with. Razor customer service could learn some lessons from them. Razor Customer service and tech support are only open on weekdays. They also were in the midst of moving their warehouse and cannot ship anything for another week. So the nice gift she received is worthless and they think waiting 2weeks for a possible solution is acceptable. I cannot really review this product but because of their customer service and attitude I will not buy from them again. Amazon immediately ordered a replacement and was very apologetic for the inconvenience. It should arrive 8 days before the replacement part is even shipped from razor.
2,"if you like zany over the top, this is one for you","I know I will get lots of ""unhelpful"" votes for this, but I must say that this comedy did not work for me. The characters are exaggerated, even offensive (well, not PC), and the situations are utterly outlandish if not grotesque (e.g. eating the neurotic stutterer's fish right out of the acquarium). OK, the actors are all extremely good. Alas, taken together, I just felt like I was wasting my time watching this, like it was too silly to believe. What I mean is, it didn't click, my laughs were forced and rare, and I couldn't suspend my disbelief, but instead constantly felt like someone was making this up as they went along.Not recommended."
2,Quite simply the best comedy film in decades.,"This movie is, in a word, hilarious. I defy anyone to watch it and not have tears streaming down their face from laughter. It's one of those classic, uproariously insane comedies in the Monty Python style, just plain crazy funny. I am an animal lover but even the part where the poodles that get annihilated was hilarious and Michael Palin's reactions to that are beyond funny. This is one movie that is guaranteed to make you scream with laughter. I have seen it about a dozen times and it still makes me laugh till I cry."
1,"""funny"" spelled v-u-l-g-a-r","I loved Kevin Kline in ""Dave"" and Jamie Lee Curtis in ""Trading Places"", so I sadly wasted my time and money on this vulgar and silly garbage. CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!"
5,"""You are a Vulgarian""","This is a comedy that is really and genuinely funny. John Cleese's script gives the bulk of the laughs to Americans Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis. The charachters played by Cleese and Palin mainly play as straight men for the wild antics of the 2 Americans. Cleese gets in some great lines here and there also such as the quote above that I'm using as the title for the review.Kline won the Academy award for Best Supporting Actor for this role of Otto and deservedly so as he is just wonderful in all his scenes. Curtis is equally strong as Wanda and one of her best parts right up there with Ophelia in ""Trading Places"" and the 2 Brits play their parts well also.Little tidbit - the name of Cleese's character is Archie Leach which was the real name of Cary Grant, who was certainly no stranger to great comedy himself. This is a great one when you need some laughs as they are very much here."
4,Pretty good,"I had heard of this movie from the late 80s but only watched it in 2012. I enjoyed it, I must say. Well worth renting. What more do you want me to say?"
4,"No Honor Among Thieves (But Some Laughs, Apparently)","A Fish Called Wanda is a delightful little comedy about a heist-gone-right-gone-wrong.It seems that there's very little honor among thieves, when four crooks can't follow the get-away plan they'd concocted because they're too busy trying to screw each other out of the loot. We follow them as they plot, and counter-plot against one another, leading to what is possibly the most hilarious torture scene ever filmed, and a number of awkward, aborted attempts at adultery.The question finally becomes: who is so low that they'll manage to out-con the others? And to answer that, you need to watch the movie.Fun, funny, and not showing age one bit. Four stars."
5,"I was not dis-appointed, I loved it","this is one of the best comedy movies I have ever seen. they couldn't remake it or rewrite anything , but I still wish they'd try."
2,Love the film! DVD is atrocious!,"NOTE: This review is about the 1998 version of the DVD. Newer releases may be better quality.--------------This film is definitely on my top ten list of funniest movies of all time, with ""Some Like it Hot,"" ""National Lampoons Christmas Vacation"" and the Monty Python masterpieces...But this DVD is atrocious. The soundtrack is all in the center channel... haven't heard anything worse since I gave up watching a TV with a 3 inch speaker. The theme song is burbled and warbly. There is no separation -- even to the front speakers. The dialog is flat as a flitter.The picture quality is a hair better than off the air, rabbit ear antennae reception. At times the picture is choppy and halting -- as if you were watching it on a rental video that has been viewed too many times.The only extra is the film's trailer.Wait for a re-release before buying!"
5,A Fish Caled Wanda,"This film ""A FISH CALLED WANDA' is a must have. It is funny, smart. I have only had this copy for a ashort time and have viewed it twice."
5,One of my top 5 comedies of all time.,"John Cleese was not my favorite member of Monty Python, but he certainly has done the best work since. His wit and slapstick made Faulty Towers a must have. With ""Fish"" he showed Hollywood he could transfer that brilliance to the big screen. Cleese stays in the background in this one allowing most of the big laughs to go to Kline and Palin. There is enough here for everyone with some slapstick , romantic comedy, and politically incorectness thrown into this ""who gets the girl, who gets the loot"" farce. Oh, by the way, watching Jamie Lee get all warm and fuzzy a couple times doesn't hurt none either :)"
5,One of the most enjoyable films I've seen,"The cast in this fils are excelent, The humor wonderful, and the story supurb. One of my favorite films"
4,John Cleese + Micheal Palin + and Kevin Kline = Very Funny!,"If you like Monty Python humor, but at times find it to be a little too much, this movie is perfect for you. The Monty Python-ish humor that is there isn't overwhelming for the average viewer. When you watch this movie, remember one thing...""Re--vvenge!"""
5,"Another classic, quote-a-minute movie","John Cleese, Michael Palin, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Klein all turn in extraordinary and perfect performances. But Klein steals the show as Otto, he is absolutely brilliant. So many great scens, and a surprising number of excellent one-liners, too. Cleese did a good job of writing a story that would go over well on both sides of the Atlantic. Some great scenes are the the nude dance by Cleese, the part where Otto eats the fish and, my personal favorite, the XK-Red-27 technique explanation by Otto. The only quibble : too small a part for Michael Palin."
2,Silly and Stupid,"I knew there was a reason I had always avoided seeing this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is the only entertaining actor in this very mediocre movie. It's just too ridiculous to keep your attention from the very beginning in my opinion. It has a very poor plot and really centers around Jamie Lee Curtis' character using her body to get her way and men who drop 50 IQ points around her. I hated it, but obviously at 4.5 stars, a lot of people love silly movies that go nowhere. To each their own. If you are a fan of the actors in the movie, most likely, you will like it."
1,Insipid,"Sometimes coming up with 20 words for these reviews is hard. This movie can be summed up in one word: STUPID. I had high hopes for it, given the stellar cast and the great reviews on here, but I for one will NEVER watch this turkey again. There is not one laugh in the entire movie."
1,DVD Won't even play,"This review is only for the disc, not the movie.I bought this DVD back in 2009 and left it sitting unopened on a shelf with my other DVDs. Last night I finally opened the package for the first time and tried to watch it and the disc wouldn't even play. Started stuttering in the opening scene and never got better. After 5 minutes of the movie stuttering and jumping around I finally turned it off. Very aggravating.Thinking it might be the DVD player I got out my old DVD player that I'd recently replaced with a blu ray player and tried to play it on that one as well with the same result.Bottom line, the disk is defective/poor quality. Seeing as I bought this 2 years ago I'm not very confident that Amazon would even consider replacing it so I'm just going to have to eat the loss.Can't recommend this product at all. I'd give it zero stars if possible."
2,DVD fans...,"Fear not, DVD fans, a brand new Special Edition version will be released in the first quarter of 2002!"
4,Fun to watch,"Okay I watch this movie so much my poor videotape is begging me to put it out of it's misery. Which is why I will be getting the DVD of this soon. Backstapping and comedy, the perfect combination for this film. Well cast and just tons of fun to watch."
3,I liked Fierce Creatures Better,"I had the opportunity to watch this after watching Fierce Creatures first. Actually, I was glad I saw that movie first, because I personally did not like this one. Wanda had a lot of potential and had a lot of witty things in it not tried before, yet, the crudeness made me a little tired.Interesting to see how things lightened up in comedy in the 90's compared to this 1980's flick about crime. There were definately some very funny scenes, Kevin Kline showing up all the time was really fun, wondering what he would say when he did, and the gem to me was Michael Palin chasing after a witness that he trying to off. That had me in stiches.I rated this movie a three because of the concept of attempting to get to the stash by whatever means possible was very clever. Cleese in court was outstanding. This movie will be liked by most, however, there is too much language and crudeness as you can see in the other reviews."
4,Fish called Wanda,Kevin Cline at his best. I just love this movie for a host of reasons. For anyone that loved the Monty Python humour. John Clesse is great and so is Michael Palin. Just loved this film.
4,K-K-K-K-Ken is c-c-c-coming to k-k-k-kill me!,"Hilarious, wonderful film with many twists and hundreds of classic moments. The cast is perfect, and Kevin Kline deservedly won an Oscar in one of the greatest comedic performances ever. A great double feature with the sadly underrated ""Fierce Creatures."" For a fun flub, watch carefully during the scene in which Jamie Lee Curtis visits John Cleese's office to discuss the case. As she is leaving, you can clearly see a reflection in the mirror of the camera and several crew members."
3,three point five stars,"I'm surprised how far back some fans are going when they state ""It's his best since....."" To my ears, LIARS is Todd's best since NEARLY HUMAN in '89, but I don't think it's quite as good as that one. I must say, I HATE the way all the tracks run together. I'm a big fan of random/shuffle play, plus I like to program around dud tracks, but you can't do that smoothly with the LIARS CD. Another problem: the cover art is just ghastly. It's the sort of thing that will scare away potential buyers who are curious about the CD, but not sure if they should take the plunge. There are a number of tracks I could easily live without, including ""Mammon"" (annoyingly over-the-top vocals), ""Soul Brother,"" and ""Flaw."" On the other hand, tracks like ""Past,"" ""Afterlife,"" and ""God Said"" are classic Rundgren. And, the opening song, ""Truth,"" sounds like a collaboration with Pet Shop Boys. A very cool thing indeed..."
3,Close but No Cigar.....,"First the good news. This is the best Todd effort since ""The Tortured Artist Effect"". Now the bad news. It is NOT vintage Todd. Traces of melody surface throughout, surrounded by thought provoking lyrics...The problem here is the lack of ""real life playing"". The genius of Todd is largely due to his ability to play a multitude of instruments (guitar,piano, bass, sax etc...) .""Liars"" is filled with drum machines, tape sampling etc. As a result, the ""classic"" Todd feeling/emotion is replaced by a synthetic sound. With this said, there are still some ""gems"" on this effort , such as ""Wondering"", ""Past"",""Sweet"" and ""Stoodup"". Although this is not Todd's best work, it is still FAR better than what is being put out on today's music scene."
5,Take your time for Todd,"This is possibly Todd's best & innovative album of the last decade. Not just a random collection of songs, but a cohesive setwhen it comes to the music, lyrics as well as production.For that matter, it also works best(at least for me) when you listen to it as a whole. Get in the groove so to speak.Personal favorites : The hattrick at the end.- Afterlife: one of the best ballads in years- Living : that relentless beat really doest it for me- God Said : a worthy finale.By the way, talking about detail : how about the X-files-theme played throughout the last 30 seconds of ""The Wondering"".Nice touch Todd, fits in with the heart of the lyrics very well."
3,MANY HAVE WRITTEN REVIEWS OF THIS ALBUM,"I don't know what Amazon is doing, but there have already been numerous reviews of this album posted to this site. They've wiped them out and are acting like it's never been reviewed. Beware of such treachery!As much as I respect and admire Todd, this is not one of his best albums. He's essentially angry and lazy in this album. Several of these cuts sound much like cuts from earlier albums, especially TR-1 No World Order.My favorite cut on this album is 'Stood Up'. It reminds me of some of his greater works more than 10 years back.As I said in my first review of this album - Todd doesn't bring his guitar mastery into the spotlight in this album. Yes, his guitar is in here somewhere, but not the powerful stuff that can and has stunned and amazed us in the past. Remember his work on 'Number One Lowest Common Denominator'? We don't get anything like that here. Oh well. Long may Todd compose, record, tour and produce. He's often a breath of fresh air."
2,I'm trying to like this...,"...I WANT to like this.I'm trying to get past the repetitious music, the numbing overall effect.Todd Rundgren is a very talented artist...a great guitar player and an icon 'round these parts.Contrary to what you may have heard or read, he is NOT godd.I'm trying to like this record......but I can't.It just isn't THERE.Know what I mean?"
3,"Nice, but....","It may be hard to tell from the title of my review, but I'm definitely a Rundgren fan. I admire this creative being very much. There are only a relative few who's music I would bother putting on a cassette for listening in the car. Rundgren is one of those few. I was pleased to learn of this new album of new tunes.There's only one tune on this CD that I really like. That's 'Stoodup'. It harkens back to some of Todd's earlier masterpieces.It was disappointing that Rundgren didn't bring his guitar mastery out into the spotlight on this CD. Yes, his guitar work is certainly in there, but he's not zapping us with it as he has in the past. No, he's not a Hendrix, but his guitar style has a power we just don't hear much these days.I hope Todd will continue to create. We need him, especially now, in these dark times."
2,Whats the big deal?,"First of all let me say that I believe Todd is a fantasticly talanted artest. But......don't get suckered into the 5 star hype... I think the 2 I gave a bit generous.Other unimpressed reviewers have expressed concerns about ""F bombs"" and social political messages. Not me, thats not the problem... The problem is... THE MUSIC IS NOT VERY GOOD."
3,Todd and I are getting older...,"I like Todd's music.. From Nazz thru Utopia to With a Twist I have listened and enjoyed his view of the world. He is indeed a wizard and a true star. But this collection is disappointing on several levels.First, why the profanity? Yes we all know it exists, and some of us even use it in situations, but as my 11th grade English teacher said, it just proves you don't have enough vocabulary if you need to be profane to get your point across. F-bombs and Todd don't mix. He's got better skills than that.Second, we true fans have been around as long as he has. We don't need to be preached to about the dark side.....Third, this one sounds like he ""mailed it in"".I give it 3 stars out of respect for the artist."
1,A Far Cry From Todd's Best,"This album is a far cry from Something Anything, A Wizard A True Star, etc. Something Anything, Hermit and Tortured Artist were all great records where Todd played all the instruments, sang all the vocals and wrote all the songs. This record is just weak to mediocre at best. The songs are weak. The drums and keyboards sound like a cheap Casio keyboard. I can't recall one chorus. Because I know and love the great music that has come from Todd Rundgren throughout his career, I can't give this effort anything more than 1 star."
1,there is no market for this music,"This cd stinks! How someone in 2004 would make a record like this simply bewilders me. Ironically, the production is terrible. It is hard to tell if any real instruments were used. All sounds emanate from like... a cheap casio keyboard. It sounds like a non-commercialized, poorly produced ""Thompson Twins"" record... but without the hooks! I saw Todd in West Palm Beach and the concert also was bad because all he did was play extended versions of these very self-indulgent songs. This music is indicative of the bad Todd music from the past rather than the Something/Anything, Mink Hollow, Wizard a true star Todd. Remember when Todd whould do a really weird 30 minute song on his albums from the 1970's? Liars is like that but without any of the good songs. I challenge the positive reviewers. Even if you like the cd today, you will never listen to it a year from now. This is cd is destined to be a ""cut out"", out of print record in the future."
1,very unhappy,"Did not recieve my book, I emailed seller twice and they never responded. Would definately NOT order from again."
3,St. Martin's Handbook,The St. Martin's HandbookWas a bit disappointed as the book was supposed to have been new but the cover had a number of scuffs and rub marks. Balance of the book appeared new. Did not send back because my daughter needed it for a class she was taking.
4,St.Martin's Handbook 3rd Edition,"This is a excellent resourse for the young writter to get reference how to write up reference and other english grammer. This book helped me in writting up my thesis and papers. This book can be used by graduate and undergraduate students. I recommend every home, office, and research laboratories ,universities should had it on there desk for reference. This is good resourse for International students, involved in any type of writing papers in scenitific journals."
2,Book Received,"Seller advertised this as new, but it was not. Very worn and dog-eared, not worth the price."
3,Old MLA version,"Since the anglophiles had to change the MLA bibliography rules, this book is now dated. It's fine for grammar and whatnot but don't follow the MLA citation guidelines."
3,"Handy, but not that many examples","It's handy for a quick review of formats that you usually already know of, but there's not that many examples for very specific things that you need like quoting sources."
4,4 interesting pieces from the czech composer,"if you're a janacek fan with very little money and a working cd player this may be the disc for you. i'm not overly familiar with the composer's work myself and wouldnt exactly say this disc made me a convert but it is well worth a listen. not exactly my cuppa tea since i generally listen to string quartets when i'm trying to brood over the meaning of life and whatnot but still these are some pleasant, high energy pieces well played by prague's very own vlach quartet. sound recording is alright, it aint mind-blowing but what exactly do you expect for this price?"
4,Definitely Immigrant Literature,"The story is poetically written. It is an immigrant literature piece, outlining the realities of moving from your home country to the unknown. It does end abruptly, and is not a ""fluffy"" story. However, Ricci does reveal the truths of his own life in the novel, serious and sad. Not for the faint of heart, but very well done."
4,Wonderful!,"I really enjoyed reading this book and finished it in a matter of days. A wonderful look at an Italian village, its people, their superstitions, alliances and lifestyles. It was particularly interesting for the way it was told, through the eyes of a young, naive boy. Looking forward to new titles from this author."
4,Good read,i had to read this book for an english assignement. once i got through the book i couldn't belive how good it was.
2,It left many items unveiled....,"I believe that the book was not as good as other critics found it to be. The plot of the book shifted many times and sublots became the main plot, and I found it very difficult to understand. I also saw that the themes in the book were underdeveloped. The themes in the book did not truly intertwined with the main plot of the book. However, I did find that the them of freedom coincides with the characterization of Vittorio's mother, Cristina Innocente. Although I did not thoroughly enjoy this book, I did not find it all as a bore. I do recommend this book to those people who do have nothing else to do with their lives. If you are on a train or plane or anywhere else where you have nothing to do, I suggest to pick up this book and try to explain it to me."
5,Up there with Angelgrinder!,"Lord Belial is one of the top Black Metal bands! Clever lyrics, melodic and powerful. Angelgrinder is their best so far, but this is close. LB will never sell out, they have INTEGRITY!"
5,Great product,I received the product fast. As well as it fits great and had no problems what so ever. Would recommended this product to anyone who has a mustang.
3,"OK, but for educational value, choose something else","The games on this just don't match the age range. The games were too hard for my four year old, but I think an older child that could do them wouldn't like this product much."
3,Not so simple,"This book is informative, but I think the title is misleading. I'm finding I have to study it and look for answers, and use an online pronunciation guide. I have a good idea I'm pronouncing words right, but I am not sure. And I do find out some things in later chapters about spelling, grammar, and pronounciation, that would have been helpful to know earlier. I agree with their ""learn to understand French"" description of the book more than their ""learn to speak French quickly and easily"" description. I think at this point in time (I'm on chapter 7 out of 40) it will take me a long time to know French enough to speak it well. If not for the little bit of French schooling that I had from elementary and middle school years ago, I don't think I would be doing well with this book. Not for the beginner, in my opinion."
4,this is a great book,"this is a well thought out language book. I found the pronounciations particularly helpful, and it is laid out really well (designed well) and the grammar is concise and easy to follow. I found this book a very beneficial part of my library of 'learning french' books. It's one of my favourites."
2,Difficult,"This particular book is definitely not easy. It is for someone who knew a little French and needed a refresher course. It is not for someone who is attempting to learn the language for the first time, as it does not come with a CD. It is nice to see the pronunciation spelled out but it is not phonetic as in English, so makes it confusing. Good book for those who need a refresher."
2,In my experience.....random on?,"My first unit seemed to arbitrary switch on regardless of the remote being on or off. I called Pilot and they called it a warranty issue and took care of it. My second unit also switches on at random. So much of I have to uninstall it. I really wish it didn't. It seems to switch on at night (and drain the battery or scare the neighbors) It's not the buttons being hit by accident, as the switch is put away and and toggled off."
5,Awesome!!!,Pros: this does exactly what i wanted it to do and it works flawlessly the inline fuse block mad the installation very simple and it works like a charm and made my show car look so much better by eliminating all the switches.Cons: only thing and its not even a big deal but the receiver antenna wire pretty much has to be bolted (metal to metal) to the car for it to get a decent range when the trunk is closed.overall: fantastic product and works great.
3,To control my LEDs,The remote device is easy too hook up but the instructions is rather limited. Plus part of the instructions was covered up by the security theft patch used for shoplifting prevention. I had to contact manufacturer to send me a copy. The included remote 12v battery was dead when I received it and one button on the remote is not working. I have to uninstall the whole unit and send it back just to get the remote replaced. A useful feature is that the device has 4 built in relays so you can hook it up to the negative or positive side of whatever you wish to control. You can even set it for momentary on or push on/push off. Would of given it higher ratings except for the hassle of the remote fob being bad and receiving it with a dead battery.
5,Great product,The directions on the back of the product are absolutly terrible. They tell you little to nothing about the device and half of the important part is covered up by a security stickers thus making it unreadable. Once you figure it out it works amazingly! As the previous buys said there you need to supply power to each of the four accessories as well as the main power wire for the reciever. Take a look at this forum for extra help:[...]
3,Practice for the Boards,"I don't know which book the Oct 2000 reviewer was looking at, as my copy of this book is nothing but explanation of answers. This is a useful book for people who learn well from testing their knowledge through question and answer, however be sure to supplement this with more up-to-date sources such as Qbank, First Aid 2003 or Step Up to make sure you focus on the more pertinent subject matter and not minutiae! Good luck on the boards!"
4,A Sturdy Seat,"This is a nice sturdy, heavy weight, soft toilet seat. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4,Fantastique,Le Canadian Brass est un des meilleurs quintettes de cuivres au monde et ils le prouvent avec ce CD.
4,Good product,I like this product but the only thing is that I thought it was an original CD or DVD...its copied from one ....so far no problems ...I love this movie and wanted to have it..
5,Boys Town [VHS],This product completely fulfills my requirements for its ease of use. It provides the accuracy I require. It is entirely recommendable.
2,Can't finish it.,"While it's not the worst I've read, Priestess of the White is uninspired, flat, and uneven. The premise is interesting, but as another reviewer noted, too much explanation. The main character is unrealistic and dull -- too perfect, too wise for her years, and uninteresting to watch, reading more as a wish-fulfillment character than a real protagonist.While I didn't find Ms Canavan's first trilogy the greatest thing since sliced bread, it was more engaging on the whole -- the main character had real obstacles, and not all motives were displayed from the first appearance of each character, so there was something to compell further reading. Not so here."
5,a great start to a trilogy,"Based on my experience with Trudi Canavan, I immediately expected for the book to be great. What I was surprised at was that it was almost a different type of writing style from the Black Magician Trilogy. Often writers fall into the habit of maintaining a similar writing style throughout their books, but the similarities ended in that it was just another good book. The book itself is written well, and you find yourself sympathizing with various characters, or despising others, and it's in a way that makes you think it's what Canavan intended you to feel towards the character while she developed them. I was caught unawares when the book ended, and expected there to be more. I can hardly wait for May when the second book comes out!"
3,Mediocre and Slow,"This book was a disappointment after the Black Magician trilogy. I was expecting excitement and drama, but the book moved very slowly - to the point that I almost put it down a couple of times. This book is almost 600 pages long, but there seemed to be excessive time spent introducing us to the actual meat of the plot - the first half could easily have been cut in half without losing anything. The second half definitely reawoke some of my interest, to the point that I'm still considering reading the second novel and giving the trilogy another chance, but this first book was average at best, and a VERY slow read."
4,A Very Decent Fantasy Book,"I am an avid fantasy lover and I happened to come across this in a bookstore and decided it looked interesting. Well, it was. It was nothing special, but a decent read none the less. The characters are easy to like and the story is very intriguing so all in all, it was a solid 4 stars."
1,Bored,Like the Black Magician trilogy. Don't like this book. The characters are dull and nothing interesting happens to them. What more can I say?!
1,Not even for children,"This book is so simplistic that even children who are being introduced to the fantasy genre won't like it, let alone adults. Absolutely shallow characters and overtly childish reasoning and narration completely spoils this book. This book is certainly not for you if you are an avid fantasy reader."
1,Disappointing,After reading the Black Magician trilogy I had high hopes of Trudi Canavan's new series.While her first series was interesting and well paced - this series I found to be completely different. The writing style is very different and I found myself getting bored with all the descriptive text which at times was very unnecessary. The leading character is very dull and I can't seem to make a connection of caring what happened to her as I did with Sonea.This book is overall a hugh disappointment and if you loved the Black Magician Trilogy then I would suggest you think about hiring this prior to buying - just so as you don't feel like you've wasted money.My opinion - stick to the Black Magician Trilogy
4,Good read,good strong characters. Great story and well written. Looking forward to reading more in the next book. Would recommend .
4,"Good, but could have been better.","This is the first book I've read by this author, and I really liked most parts. Some parts were a bit plodding and stupid (IE, why would a character like Auraya do what she did in that particular situation?), but overall, the result was a good book. I got it for a little over a dollar at a used bookstore, and I can say that the dollar was definitely not wasted. I will be looking for more books by this author, either second hand or from Amazon."
5,Great quality and service,Great book. I could not put it down and cannot wait to read the others in the series.
2,Priestess of the White,"The White, a group of five immortal magician/priestesses seek only the good, to bring together an alliance among all the human and non human beings they serve. Naturally, this does not please the evil beings in the world, and they want to overthrow the White. The dark ones are lead by a mysterious man wholly committed to his vile purposes. Standing against this is Auraya, a courageous young woman who once saved her village and thus earned a place in the White. She does not believe herself to be a leader, but finds herself called upon so to be. As violence erupts around her, Auraya finds unusual allies and hidden strengths in herself to use in this war.** This sweeping fantasy is marred by many things. Point of view shifts take place constantly, making focus difficult; and the entire thing feels rather padded and top heavy. Epic fantasy is a tough genre to do well. While this is a credible attempt, it's been done better. **Amanda Killgore"
5,"Canavan, an excellent read","Some authors are good, some are better. Ms. Canavan writes an excellent story. Her descriptives make me (a word person) happy. This is the second trilogy of hers that I have read and I am looking forward to her upcoming work."
3,a bit desapointed,"After reading the magician's trilogy I fond the first book quite boring, there was a lack of consistency.I liked the main caracter but I kept expecting a development that never arrived."
2,60 minutes-Morgan Freeman,This Dvd was way too short....would not recommend to anyone and I adore Morgan Freeman!
4,Not the original Australian Release from 1985,"If you're an Australian buyer looking to replace your original vinyl copy of this album from 1985, beware. This is not what you're looking for. This is a combination of 6 tracks from Love An Adventure, 3 tracks from Autumnal Park and the addition of the smash hit single Funkytown all for the benefit of the US market. To date, the original Love An Adventure (to my knowledge) is not available on CD.This is definitely a showcase of the best of Pseudo Echo, and if you're just after something great to listen to, you're in for a treat. My personal favourites - Living In A Dream and Lies Are Nothing. Two fabulous songs that just pick you up and sweep you along with their momentum.Pseudo Echo's first release, Autumnal Park is a much more serious sounding album. The tracks included are A Beat For You, Listening (their very first single) and Destination Unknown. Everything else on this CD is just so much fun to listen to. It's all great music anyway!"
4,you're not listening,"Most people only know the Australian group Psuedo Echo for their cover of ""Funkytown"", but the album is full of great rock-pop tunes. ""Listening"" and the title track are two of the best selections."
3,A fun album,"Love an Adventure is the second full-length album from Pseudo Echo. It was released in 1987. It sports ten tracks--one of these being a cover of ""Funkytown"" by Lipps Inc. The material is in a pop rock musical direction. Overall, the songwriting is solid, the musicianship is tight, and the sound quality is satisfying. A nice mixture of guitar/keyboard work is displayed. Brian Canham's vocals are smooth and likeable. The keyboarding--provided by James Leigh--is pleasing. My favorite songs are ""Try,"" ""I Will Be You,"" and ""Lonely Without You."" The spirited ""Try"" exhibits a nice intro and cool keyboard playing from Leigh. The sleek ""I Will Be You"" furnishes a gratifying intro keyboard melody from Leigh and a refrain that is atmospheric and pretty. The plaintive ""Lonely Without You"" features an attractive chorus. The CD insert includes the song lyrics. The disc is almost 43 minutes. Love an Adventure is recommendable."
3,About time too,"Its been other three years since new Manics material, and the train crash which was 'Know your Enemy'. So have the Manics of the past which produced the dark Holy Bible and the anthem ridden 'Everything Must Go'? No. However this does not make this a bad album at all, far from it. It kicks off with the brilliant '1985', which is the best track on the album by far. What follows is 'The Love of Richard Nixon' which is a good song but does sound very out of place on this album. Track three is 'Empty Souls' which is another highlight of the album. then sadly this album does what 'This is my truth, tell me yours' does. It finishes with nine average and below avearge songs. Higlights of these are 'Song for Departure', 'Glasnot', 'Solitude Sometimes Is' and 'Cardiff Afterlife'. Overall it is really an album for hardcore fans and people who enjoy bands like Keane, Travis and Coldplay, also may enjoy it. Not a classic, but neither is it bad."
3,is this George Michael?,"this is the worst album by the manics which means it's not all that bad but it's missing something, it's too pop and doesn't rock enough, i really liked ""know your enemy"", thought it was a great album along with their other previous releases, to me this is like a weak pop album, it's a nice late night album, guaranteed to make you sleep."
4,serial killer of young men,"Gay southern california serial killer, tortures and dumps dead bodies along the side of the road.Young male marines, hitchikers, teenagers and innocent men begin to disappear and turn up dead, dumped along thehighways of souther california. Police are looking for a serial killer. This is really good story of the Randy Craft murders. I like true crime and this was good a four/4 star."
4,Angel of Darkness,"Having no special interest in serial killers, I read this book only because I once hired Randy, I was asked to give a deposition after he was arrested, and I hadn't followed his story beyond that. I was amazed to find that he might be responsible for as many killings as he is now suspected of.Although the content of this book is excellent, I thought the writing was mediocre. Possibly this is because the approach was to ""novelize"" it. I would have preferred a more straightforward, factual approach, in which I would know which cases were actually attributed to Randy and which ones were not. As I realized that the author wasn't going to provide that information in context, I hoped that he would at least provide it after the fact, either during the trial coverage or possibly in some summary form at the end of the book. He did neither.While the content makes for a compelling read, and I would therefore recommend the book, I obviously wouldn't recommend the author."
5,Shocking Book Not For The Meek,Shocking the torture the chase that was lead. It had you thinking the killer was found but it was another serial killer than you found out even more. The photos are shocking the way he killed very good book. He is a very cold person also.
3,Could've been A LOT better...,"I'm more of a fan of true crime written in ""novel"" form (Jack Olsen, Ann Rule, et al). MacDougal is a journalist and this book is very choppy. It's as if newspaper articles were strung together, and as a result, the book lacks flow and suspense. Randy Kraft was a very prolific killer, so the material alone merits the book a 3 star rating."
1,This book leaves much to be desired,"Although this story is very interesting, it is extremely hard to follow. The author jumps around way too much, making it difficult to understand what he is saying. I had to read some of the chapters over and over, and I still didn't understand what he was trying to get across. I do not reccomend this book."
3,not my favorite Lapsang,"This tea is just OK. It's not as strong or smokey as other brands (Twinings) which I don't like. It tastes weak or watery to me. That said I will drink it, it's not bad, just not my favorite brand."
4,Pretty good.,"I have had this CD for several months and have listened to the entire thing at least 30 times over. While a couple of the songs are a bit repeditive, overall the music is excellent, with a variety of different tones. Chip Davis has done an excellent job of continuing the legacy of Mannhiem Steamroller and the Fresh Aire series.As compared to all the rest of the Fresh Aire set, I'd say that this is one of the middling ones."
3,Excellent but dated,"This is a must read for any homebrewer but if I had to choose I would get 'How to Brew"" by John Palmer instead."
2,Out of date,"This is the first book I got for homebrewing and it has some good information to get you started. However, it has a lot of not very good info/advice that is pretty out of date for such a recent book. I'm not sure he's kept it up to date with new advances and equipment that's come to market. In addition, it is very annoying to read. About the thousandth time he advises you to ""relax and have a homebrew"" you'll be ready to pitch the book and use the internet or order a new book. And the lame pictures of him and his wife are just not at all helpful. I would recommend looking at other books such as ""How to Brew"" by John Palmer or just search the internet."
5,Great Book But...,This is a great book and the hard copy version I purchased has helped make me a better home brewer. I give it five stars but I'm not going to pay $10.99 for the Kindle version. Amazon says the publisher set the price on this Kindle version. Does the author get more of a cut from the e-version since there are no overhead costs printing an electronic copy or is the publisher just raking in obscene profits?
3,Helpful but lacking,"This review is on the kindle edition.While I found this book useful in areas, I also feel it was lacking in other areas. I cannot quite put my finger on it... At one time I previously had an earlier version and liked it at that time. Maybe it's the kindle layout? Maybe I was expecting specific recipes? I'm not sure.In the kindle edition the tables do not appear well. Also do not expect recipes. No discussion on today's available cleaning and sanitation chemicals other than bleach. In all, I mainly do not like this book on the Kindle and wish I would have bought this as a 2nd choice book in paperback instead."
5,Essential,This book is essential for any individual considering persuing the art of homebrewing beer.
3,Homebrewing,"Although it is fascinating to find out about the history of brewing, I had thought that this book would be more about estimating and making new batches andrecipes."
4,"Good book, slightly disorganized","If you're brewing for the first time, this book contains everything you need to know to make good beer. If you're an experienced brewer, you may find it hard to quickly look up certain information in this book, which is a pain in the neck. For example, this book contains many recipes, spread throughout the book based on technique used to brew the beer -- but the recipes aren't in the index."
5,The Complete Joy of Homebrewing Third Edition,"Great Book, perfect for homebrewers. Book was brand new, as stated. Very easy transaction, quick shipping. My boyfriend is extremely happy :) Now to just purchase all, the supplies!!!"
4,Really Helped,Bought this book before I started brewing and it really helped.It will get you through the basics and as far as you want to go. There are gobs of recipes listed with complete descriptions. I know I will be brewing quite a few of them. Recommend it highly.
5,A must have volume in a brewing book collection,"When I first went to my local homebrew shop and asked what book would be the best one to start homebrewing with, this was the one that was recommended. Charlie Papazian does an outstanding job of making homebrewing simple and approchable for someone new to the hobby. He goes into a good description of all of the ingredients and how they contribute to the flavor of beer. There are pages of good guides to hops which I have found very useful in making hops substitutions. This is becoming important as many popular hops become harder to find. My only comment is that I think his initial brew chapter has a little more equipment than you really need to start. There are many other good brew books that I have found good for my library, but this is a good one. Every homebrewer should have this book out of respect for what Charlie has done to make homebrewing a nationally accessible hobby."
5,Inspired my homebrew endeavor!,When I first started thinking about making my own homebrew I had asked a friend who is a doctor in the field of chemical engineering. He told me to pick up this book and read it through and let the brewing begin. I did just that and it opened pandora's box so to say. I have been homebrewing ever since and this book had been the biggest inspiration to get me going. It was full of information that the first time brewer would have never even thought about. So now a couple years later I'm still working at my brewing skills by extract brewing but I'm begining to work toward all grain. Bottom line great book and I would recommend it to all first time homebrewers!
3,"Fun book, but not the most helpful.","I am new to home brewing, and while I found this book useful and fun, I found the book, ""How to Brew"" by John Palmer, much more helpful. Make no mistake, it belongs in your collection if you are a brewer, but if you are new to it all, I definitely recommend, John Palmer's book."
4,essential,This book has been written both as a near encyclopaedia of brewing and an entertaining light read. You can go back to it time and again as a reference work with all the detail for an obsessive brewer. Definitely a must have when starting out on the brewing journey
2,Not great !,"Old , out of date , very hard to read. I read homebrew stuff all the time , love the topic, but this book puts me to sleep within two pages no matter where I am or the time of day . I would recommend John Palmers "" How to brew"" instead of this one."
2,Kindle Edition has horrible tables,"The book itself is excellent. Best introduction to homebrewing that I've seen. Unfortunately, there are lots of tables in the book, and they're nearly unreadable in the Kindle edition. Very disappointed."
4,Great book on homebrewing,"The advice ""Don't worry, drink a homebrew"" probably is given 50 times in this book, and that's a good thing. The way the book was presented took all of the stress out of screwing up my first batch of beer.I think the majority of the all-grain brewing sections were less clear to me than the rest, but I live in an apartment, and have very little desire to move away from malt extract right now.Would recommend this book to a friend, would buy this book again, and would gladly drink a beer with the author anytime."
2,"You should buy John Palmer's ""How to Brew""","How to Brew: Everything You Need To Know To Brew Beer Right The First TimeThe information contained in both these books is the same, it is in the organization that ""The Complete Joy of Home Brewing"" falters. I do not know John Palmer. I have Brewed over 20 batches of beer this year and am well versed in brewing procedure. I believe that ""How to Brew"" is the definitive book for beginning home brewers. Also, the first addition of ""How to Brew"" is available free online at www.howtobrew.com. I suggest that you do not buy this book.Good Brewing,Bjorn"
5,Excellent,"This book is great. The authors easy to follow instructions make homebrewing simple and easy, anyone can do it."
5,"Simply put, a must have for homebrewers!","This book is THE ONE to have for home brewers. The information will take you from brewing in the simplest of forms to all grain and everything in beteween. It was written in an easy to understand style that skips throught the nonsense and gets you to the point. Full of recipes, anecdotes, suggestions and resources, it should be required reading for all homebrewers."
5,Excellent Brewing Advice,"This is an excellent book on the basics (plus) of home brewing beer. The explanations are clear and the introduction of technical terms is very gentle. You really can read this as a novice and make a decent first batch. The author is very good at pointing out the parts of the process that really need to be followed, as well as the parts where you can ""make your own call"".I highly recommend this for anyone that wants to try brewing their own beer and have fun doing it. So, ""relax and have a home brew""."
4,Humorous,"I thought this book was pretty good. It brought homelessness iin as a subject, and we learned more about Lila. It was also pretty funny. I think the author did a GRRRRRR-EAT! job."
4,poorlittlerichgirl!!,Lila is sure that her rich dad is now bankrupt and that she must learn to live as a pauper.So she recruits Melissa Mccormick ... to give her poor lessons ...
3,It was missing so elements like the main characters,"I have read a few of Ms. Whitefeather's series books, but this to me felt lacking the main characters were just there. I don't feel they were developed or even likeable, just there. I liked the secondary characters better. The hero was tormented and we understand why, its spelled out without emotions, the heroine is going through something but instead of digging deeper, with her fear and concern she is just going through the motions and I don't think its because of shock, I just didn't like. I gave it three stars because it takes a lot for me to pick up a book and buy it, so the summary was better than the book itself. I will however keep an eye out for the next story involving a secondary character."
5,A beautifully written life story of hope and redempemtion,"For anyone who has ever witnessed a loved one do the slow dance with alcoholism, Lorian Hemingway's memoir is waiting for you. Yet another lesson that life is best described with four letter words: love, hate, hope and dirt. I laughed out loud at her hilarious drug hazed antics and cringed as she began her long drawn out fall. Her honesty is astounding: no regrets, no finger pointing, no pass off of responsibility of her actions. Thank you, Lorian, for this memorable book."
3,"great taste, so-so packaging","Crackers were great, when they were not crumbled... probably due to shipping and handling issues, but about 30% of the crackers in this shippment arrived in pieces. I liked them anyway, but I cannot give it more than 3 stars."
3,crackers are crackers?,"I'm not crazy about Carr's crackers, but a lot of people are. HUGE assortment of crackers in each box. Amazon shipping for me was fine, with less than 10% of the crackers broken, but it seems to be a random thing on how well they were packed."
5,Honor your night-stand with this one; Instantly re-readable!,"Walking in Humility is a wonderful read for any man or woman looking for deeper meaning in life. It is filled with pertinent real world examples, Biblical references, and other wisdom from the great minds of our time.Well written and instantly re-readable; found myself rereading favorite sections again before even finishing the book the first time. I am proud to say Walking in Humility is my answer to the question, ""what is on your night-stand""; highly recommended reading."
4,It's red,"Although the picture shows the cover as black, and the packaging lists the binding as black bonded leather It was in fact burgundy in color. Aside from the mislabeled color the print was larger than a regular bible the binding seemed sufficiently sturdy and the paper had a nice feel to it."
4,Perfect book for teaching Production Management Classes,We use the book in our production courses at the university of Oldenburg in Germany. It's highly appreciated by the students. The CD is a big support for preparing the classes. The only deficit is the fact that not all pictures and tableaus of the book are part of the CD.Prof. Dr. Uwe Schneidewind University of Oldenburg schwind@hrz1.uni-oldenburg.de
2,Madrigals disappointing,"Was looking forward to this CD but it was sadly lacking in enjoyment. Not that it isn't done well, it's just not Baroque."
2,"Weak album with no sizzle, memorable songs or inspired playing","That's about it in a nutshell. The guitar playing is ok but Ritchie is just playing it safe with a group around him that screams ""bar band"". I think he was tired after Purple let him walk in 1993. If your curious go for it but I NEVER find myself listening to it and I have gone back several times to try and let it grow on me. Better to try an unknown artist or CD and perhaps discover a gem."
5,The Best Rainbow Album Ever!,"I must say that this Rainbow album is in my opinion, the best one. Doogie White sings like no one else, and of course Ritchie plays some excellent riffs! I enjoyed every single second of this album, and that is something that can't be said about any album. It contains an outstanding version of ""Hall Of The Mountain King"", and this along with most of the other songs, really prove that Ritchie Blackmore can still move those fingers quite fast!"
5,The Best Rock Album in Rock History,"Ritchie Blackmore does it again. His melodies are unforgettable. His music touches the listener's soul. With this album he discovers a new singer again. This is the Blackmore's farewell to the Rock. He is still in search and he is still not satisfied with music that proved in song I'm sad again. Blackmore is a genius and he left his track in history of music like Bach, Mozart and Bethoven. Thank you Ritchie for your music!!! I hope you'll be back to rock just one more time again. There are not enough stars to rate this album!"
4,Rainbow after the storm...,"Ritchie quit Purple one more time in 1994 and went straight to New York looking for new people to jam with and making sensational appearances in clubs.With brand new personnel,he resurrected Rainbow,managing to more than pull it off one more time.A great album maintaining the Rainbow standard,this is no stranger to being a classic..."
5,Great Movie,"I love Crossing Ways movie it is so amazingly good! I own the movie. The acting, directing, producing and writing of the movie is tops!I Love You for Who You Are"
3,Do not buy from 47th street photo,"Do not buy this battery from 47th street photo. They will send you Power2000 BP-2L12 - 1500mAh. I looked on their webpage and they already have the low capacityone, but not BP-2L22. I called their helpdesk and they told me to send it back but they were not willing to pay for shipping."
5,"A Great book for Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation","This book is a great collection of stories. Some are funny, some serious, but they are all about GLBT young adults. This collection is a great read for those exploring themselves or even those comfortable with their sexuality, whatever it is. It teaches us that we are all human and share all the same thoughts, gay or straight. A great book!"
4,People aren't getting it,"I saw this movie when new, and to this day I am blown away at the staging and the premise of the story. It was a truly ""revisionist"" western, when making westerns in that category became almost cliche'. Kirk Douglas is as good as usual, meaning better than most. Johnny Cash gives a suitable and able performance as the protagonist of the film. This movie is more of an ""Art House"" movie than a mainstream western, and I think that's the problem for many of those who've seen it and written about it. You really must view it in a different context than many standard fare movies of the western genre. I'd place this alongside ""The Hired Hand"" before I'd compare it to any standard western tale. I absolutely loved the duel ending, filmed as a reverie in Johnny Cash's mind as he prepares to leave town. Excellent film, but again, be warned, it's not your standard western by any means"
3,A Good Solid Western,"By no means an epic, nor is it a ""B"" movie, ""A Gunfight"" falls into the category of good mainstream western entertainment with a twist. Two famous gunfighters, one semi-active one semi-retired with a family and feeling a bit stale, meet and speculate what it might be like to fight one another for a paying audience. The idea comes to fruition and that's it in a nutshell. Solid performance by Kirk Douglas, as expected, and Johnny Cash proves he's come a long way since ""Five Minutes To Live"". Cash performs the main title as well. A good supporting cast, including Jane Alexander and a young Keith Carradine, makes this a worthwhile pic. On second thought I give it four stars. A good DVD transfer, though I'd like to see this in widescreen in a future release."
1,I received the wrong version of the dvd.,"I ordered this very version (PAL, United Kingdom, Video International) of this title (GUNFIGHT) from an outfit called DaaVeeDee. It was NOT widescreen 1.78:1, it was not even letterboxed. It wasn't even in the same package shown. The seller did not offer an exchange, but said it was exactly what I ordered. Buyer beware."
2,ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE BULLRING,"I didn't expect much from this film but the presence of Kirk Douglas, Johnny Cash, Karen Black and Keith Carradine in the cast conduced me to rent it. I must admit that the main and sole theme of Lamont Johnson's A GUNFIGHT is very good. Two aging gunfighters decide to make some money by organizing a public shootout in a bullring on the other side of the Mexican border.The problem is that you can't present a 90 minutes movie with only one idea. OK, there is another interesting scene in the film: the arrival of a young gunman in town, played by Keith Carradine, who wants to kill one of the old pistoleros. But if you like shootouts, the definitive movie about these duels is of course Samuel Raimi'sThe Quick and the Dead. In conclusion, A GUNFIGHT is a curiosity whose screenplay should have been given then to an Italian director. It typically develops the kind of theme one can find in the spaghetti westerns of that period.A DVD zone my Cash back, please."
5,Great cooler for dry climates,"This compact cooler has all the bells and whistles, including a few new ones you may not have seen before. Like a fan speed step-down for sleeping. It will alternate between fan speeds, finally slowing and then shutting off all together for sleeping.The most important thing is that it works, and it works well. It cools a room by several degrees while adding humidity to the air. This is not for you if you live in a damp or humid area (sorry Florida) but in dry climates it works like a champ.Full function remote controlMultiple fan speedsCooling or fan onlyStep down timer that automatically adjusts fan speedsSleep timerLow water alarmIonizerPowered louvers for oscilating fan direction."
4,Works as efficiently as any evaporative cooler would,"This unit is design for about a 12 X 12 foot room and can help a hot day be livable. Being able to add ice into the water trough and an ice pack into the top can lower the temperature 5-10 degrees (F). The only minor draw back is it increases humidity, my doctor would not call it a negative, which on an extremely hot day can make you feel sticky. This unit is really good in desert/low humidity geographic areas."
4,Evaporative Air Cooler Fan,"This portable evaporative cooler fan is easy to use. We used it in our bedroom in hot day nights. It was capable to create a comfort environment when the fan swung to delivered air with the cooling cycle was on. There was a timer to turn off the machine with pre-set time from 0.5 to 7.5 hour that was quite useful. We adjusted the fins of the machine so that the air blew at the level of our bed and swung around. One thing we did was to lower the air speed to medium as to reduce the noise level. In fact the noise level at high speed was much lower than those window intake fans however, we need a more quiet environment during sleep. We turned on the ionizer. We could feel there was a little different smell. It was OK with me but my wife did not like the smell so we turned it off. Overall speaking the performance of this machine was to our satisfaction and we like it."
2,Not Worth It!,"I bought this product to cool the bedroom in my home. I live in Germany and it is usually not very hot, but the last couple of weeks it has been. Well I recieved the cooler in the mail, and read the directions,plugged it in to use it around 1pm. I will be fair this is NOT a Air Conditioner, but by 3pm I had to put more Ice in the unit because it was blowing out only warm air and the water in the unit had warmed to the tempature of the room. By the time I was ready to go to bed(11pm)the room was still as warm as when I had first plugged it in. I ended up unplugging the unit and opening all the windows in my house, and it was much cooler.SPT SF-609 Portable Evaporative Air Cooler with IonizerI am very disatisifed with this product."
2,just get an A/C instead; gets moldy and gross,"I've had one of these for over a year. It works pretty well when you first get it (well, except my first one which was DOA) but over a few weeks to a month, the nylon cloth inside that's supposed to wick water down becomes totally unusable and covered in bacteria/mold/salt as your water dries on it. Eventually it becomes so crusty and gross that it's not cleanable. I tried cleaning it for two heavy duty cycles, by itself, in a brand new washing machine, and it still didn't absorb any water. Since then I've gotten it to work pretty well using an old cotton t shirt.Still this thing isn't worth the trouble, and it really is more like a super fan instead of a substitute for an A/C. If you point it right at you, then it feels nice, but don't expect to feel a difference when you walk into the room like you would with a good A/C."
2,Just another table fan.,"You would expect that a $130 cooler will be better than the $60 air cooler. It is not. I am living in a mountain region with zero moisture in atmospheric air. My apartment didn't allow me to fix a window A/C. This is why i chose to buy an affordable cooler and finally, i bought it. With so much expectations i opened and filled it with ice cold water and ice cubes. My initial impression was pretty good as it blown out little cool air (during Spring season) and later when the summer started, i had to put nearly 3-4 lbs of ice cubes everyday. I never seen any improvement in moisture nor it reduced significant temp. in my tiny studio apartment. You literally have to keep it right next to you just to feel the very little coolness it gives. Not worth the dollars i spent. This is just another fan i own..."
1,SWAMP COOLERS DON'T WORK,"Don't be a sucker like me. We didn't need to use it until yesterday and all it did was increase the humidity in my bedroom. The temp in there was 85 F, while the rest of the house was over 90. But it felt a lot hotter because in the rest of the house the humidity was a lot lower.Amazon won't let me return it, they say the warranty expired a couple of weeks ago..Only can use it as a fan with ice water to blow a little cooler air while the ice melts.I am disappoined with Amazon, I am a PRIME CUSTOMER but they treat me like dirt."
3,as advertised,It works like it's supposed to. Unfortunately when I need it it's because the humidity is up and I'm feeling the temp...that's when a swamp cooler doesn't work.
2,Blah!!!,Living in a area of low humility this requires too much water. It did not cool a 12x12 room nor would the machine fit into the design of my home
2,Not a strong draft of cool air.,The product has been fairly dependable. I use it close to my pet beds during the summer to keep them comfortable. The two dongs seemed to be more comfortable than previously. A mild draft of air was emitted by the cooler and it was only mildly cool. It didn't cool the room; only the space in close proximity to the dogs.
2,Its not that cool...,I bought this bc my room is the hottest in the summer and well... It was still pretty hot. It was a hassle filling up the tray with ice cubes and it barely blew out cool air for more than an hour. The product is made REALLY cheaply and fell apart easily. I am sad about it and I say go with an air purifier instead.
2,Okay...,You have to fill it up with water and ice and even if you fill it up with a lot of ice it doesn't get very cold. Its more of a fan with a humidifier.
4,"Works great on DRY days, not on humid and rainy days","Quick shipping was great and this baby works for what we needed it to. Once in the morning and once before bed I fill the ice up and water and make sure the machine is blowing ""cool"" air. Altho0ugh any air out of the machine is cool the ""cool"" air I'm referring to is slightly cooler. I live in the Mountain Time zone and we do not get much humidity. However, I've noticed it works not as good on humid days."
1,It is just a fan!!,"It is just a fan, not a AC. It does not cooler the room at all. I am very disappointed by it.My advice:DO NOT SPEND OVER 100 DOLLARS ON A STUPID FAN!! BUY A REAL AC!!"
1,Don't Buy this Evaporative Cooler,"I live in eastern Oregon, a dry climate with the summer temps up in the high 90's. This cooler should have been perfect for my climate, but all it did was make my home humid and warmer. With 16% humidity and outside temp of 95 degrees, my house was 82 degrees. After running this cooler for two hours my house temp went to 92 degrees. The fan barely blew, adding ice didn't help. Needless to say it was a total disappointment."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This cooler did not work as advertised. We loaded the unit with ice and it did not blow out a cooler degree of air, compared to a regular fan. We measured the temperature with a temperature gauge directly in front of the air stream in a small very low humidity room. We returned the cooler and received a refund of $95.47. However, we paid $116.47 and it cost $30.00 to ship it back, so we were out $51.00."
4,SPT SF-609 evaporative air cooler,"Very happy with my purchase. Does as advertised. The unit has cool my office space at lease 10 degrees. It is important to note that the unit is not an air conditioner, but a cooling fan."
2,Not too cool,"You get what you pay for. It's been okay to use in the bedroom with the air directed straight at me and lots of ice in the tank. It doesn't cool well at all, though.Water in the tank seems to last forever which means it is not evaporating at any decent rate. That's with humidity levels at 8-20%. I was hoping for just a bit of relief from the heat. No such luck with this unit."
5,Awesome bracelet with great meaning,I bought this bracelet and I wear it EVERYDAY!!! And everyday someone asks me about it. It gives me the opportunity to talk about it and the special students that I work with and how smart that that are and how much they teach me every day. And how much they have to offer the world. I also bought one for two other teachers and one for parents of children with autism. It meant so much to them also. I wear it with great pride. This bracelet is beautiful and to me it means a lot. I encourage anyone who works with or has a child with autism to purchase one and wear it with pride.
2,poor quality,I purchased 3 of these bracelets. I love the design but all three broke very shortly after I purchased them. The charms fell off. Looks good but poorly made.
4,Not too bad...,"I didnt like this one as much as ""Human Nature"" but its still pretty good. These guys are great songwriters."
3,ok for their catalog,One of the best sounding trios in the 70s and they continue to make good music...this one is ok for the duo now.
5,And here it is again this America-feeling,Sitting in my office in Germany America makes me feel cruising California. Love and peace to all America-fans.
2,Manheim SteamRoller ?,"READ Carefully before you buy!!!!This is NOT the Classical GAS performed by Mason Williams that made the pop charts a couple of decades ago!!!! If you like the Manheim ""style"" - this is what you will get. the basic tune is buried in the ""Manheim Style"""
2,POOR RECORDING ENGINEERING,"Excessive volumn dynamic range. Using in the car finds me frequently grabbing for the volume control. Numerous errors left in the recording: The start of track 8 has a drum sequence that had several listeners thinking that the CD player was skipping. Also in track 8 is a glaring guitar booboo left in. Some of the orchestra chording choice in Classical Gas departs significantly from the original. I liked the original much better. I think that guitar lovers will be disappointed with the orchestras nearly constant overwhelming of the guitar. While I liked some of the orchestra passages, for the most part, I prefer the original recording. Lastly there is one track that exhibits the current mode of @#$$% EXCESSIVE GRATUITOUS REPETITION. Track 9 has a single note repeated at a Chinese water torture rate during the entire recording! Why??"
5,Some awesome songs,"I bought this CD because I love Classical Gas - the original version. This CD doesn't have the original version, it has a new version which I don't think is quite as good. However, this CD deserves 5 stars because of the recording of Baroque-A-Nova. I'd never heard it till I got the CD, and after listening to it a few times it's one of my Favourite Songs Of All Time. There are some complex harmonies in there for a pop song and some unusual but gorgeous chord progressions. Apparently, this song was written from the ""off-cuts"" of Classical Gas, and it has the same sort of ""rock-song-with-an-orchestra-backing it"" style. As for the rest, they're pretty good on the whole, but it's Baroque-A-Nova that you'll keep listening to. It's a shame that Mason Williams' follow up to Classical Gas, which won two Grammys, wasn't B.A.N."
4,NICE COLLABORATION,"Chip Davis and friends know their way around a good arrangement, and some of these classic guitar tunes by the outragesouly talented Mason Williams do him and the songs justice - most notably the wonderful version of Greensleeves and of course the title track. And, as pure listening fun, the album is overall incredibly pleasant. A nice mix of old and new - and a good hook for those Mannheim Steamroller arrangements."
2,Classical Gas,The sound is too low on the CD. I was not as happy with it as other CDs by the same group.
2,Gilding the Lily,"The old expression 'gilding the lily' has never been more appropo than in this instance. If you love William's fantastic piece, the immortal ""Classical Gas"", look elsewhere. It's not that Chip Davis & co do a bad version; it's simply that they overwhelm the rich guitar, drowning it in unneccessary musical fripperies. If you like overbearing horns with your music, this is the version for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere--ideally Mason William's own 'Phonograph Album', which contains the original ""Classical Gas""."
2,not impressed,"i am a big fan of mason williams but i was disapionted with the cd, this version of classical gas did not meet my expectations. ive heard beter on the radio. i regret buying it..."
1,Nope.,"Man, I used to *love* this song (Classical Gas)! I was a 10-year-old Black kid from the Bronx and I used to spend my summers in Spartanburg SC. My dearly belated grandfather was a mail carrier and he used to take me with him on his routes. I remember the first time I heard Mason Williams' ""Classical Gas"" -- it was on the radio in his truck. I couldn't get enough of it. I remember when Tommy Smothers tried to play it on the Smothers Brothers Show. I think what got me about it was it was the first time I heard a guitar line and a bass line played at the same time by the same person. Or at least the first time I knew of it.Mannheim Steamroller steamrolled all over it with their busy, Yanni-like arrangement. They may as well have gotten someone else to play guitar, because it really didn't matter. I didn't even bother listening to the rest. I really regret having bought this."
4,Classical Gas,"This recording is not as good as the original. I like Mason Williams and I like Mannheim Steamroller, so maybe I was expecting too much from this recording. I preferred Greensleeves over the title song. Overall, while not as good as expected, this album is enjoyable!"
4,This is the Ground Truth!,"Don't know why one reviewer here is so concerned about these folks ""stealing ideas."" As Woody Guthrie once suggested, ""sharing ideas is the essence of folk music."" Hip-hop IS folk music, and it was founded on the sharing of ideas, the mixing up of old and new, the actual sampling of other works. Criticizing this CD for ""stealing ideas"" is the ultimate irony. At any rate, I'm interested in hearing as many voices from soldiers on the front line as possible. This is war. This is reality. It's urgent these voices be heard. Screw who thought of it first. No one has a monopoly on the dissemination of thoughts, feelings and ideas through hip-hop, and this CD is an excellent example of that. A good companion DVD to this CD is the documentary film, ""The Ground Truth."" You won't hear or see this stuff on CNN, that's for sure."
1,i aint even gonna listen,"looks like a rip off version of the real deal. The 4th 25th- Live From Iraq, is the real deal. buy that, not this."
5,Very good for the price,Read the reviews and ordered it. Looks fine. Looked at other brands ( professional items) and were around $150 - $200 .So here for around $15- $20 you get a good product for a good price. Suits my needs. Works fine.
3,Works Fine,Opened the sealed package Unit was fine but no spare battery like it states. Works good but don't count on a spare battery.
3,Not a Professional Tool,The readout is easy to see. The calipers do not move very smoothly. Adequate for the price and my use.
5,"Great price, great product","For the quick and easy measurements we need to perform in our laboratory, this has fit the bill exactly, and for a great price."
2,Battery impossible to change,The battery is impossible to change. It says to remove cover to change battery. Put my engineer husband to the task.... He is taking a hammer to it bout now.
5,"huh, it really IS 6 inches...","What? I was measuring a subway sandwich, what were YOU thinking about?? Eight more words required, Blue moon good drink..."
3,DAMAGED ITEM,"ORDERED CALIPERS ON 3MAY12 RECEIVED THEM 17MAY12 DAMAGED. CASE WAS CRACKED-I CAN LIVE WITH THAT-AND INSTALLED LR-44,1.5VDC BATTERY WAS DEAD. THE EXTRA BATTERY WAS OKAY HOWEVER. CALIPERS SEEM TO WORK OKAY SO FAR.THE CALIPER MANUFACTURER OWES ME ANOTHER LR-44 BATTERY--PLEASE SHIP. THANKS"
2,Poor Quality,"I bought this tool and expected a quality tool for a great price, what i received was a tool barely worth the money i payed for it.Pro - It seems accurateCons - Mine never turns off, I have to remove battery.- When you are trying to get readings sometimes the readout goes crazy and just starts puking out different numbers when trying to measure.Overall i'm disappointed in this product. The price is the only thing that saves it from being a 1 star review. If your needs require accurate measurements, and you need something that will be consistent I would highly suggest a different caliper."
2,Neiko stainless 6-inch digital caliper,"Well, it sort of works. If you are very slow and gentle with this caliper it measures accurately, but if you move the jaws of the caliper too quickly, it can become anywhere between 5 and 10 mm off.So it will give a reading of between 5 and 10mm once the jaws are shut. Additionally, the caliper I received was visibly bowed, further detracting from accuracy. If you need a digital caliper for quick accurate and precise measurements I would suggest against this product."
3,They work,"I just needed something to replace my old rusty vernier calipers, and these fit that purpose. They seem to be accurate, and are easy enough to use. The plastic housing and battery compartment seem a little flimsy, and the overall weight seems really heavy. But they measure things well, and thats all I needed."
4,Neiko 01407A Stainless Steel 6 inch Digital Caliper,"This tool is everything the Manufacturer claims it to be.The unit is precise and made of high quality materials.In retrospect, however, I wish I had chosen a non-digital unit as this unit will be useless when the battery runs out."
4,One Single Flaw,"Sturdy product with a good storage case and spare battery. My one complaint is the caliper automatically turns itself on when it senses movement, and it's sensitivity makes it difficult to turn off and stay off. Not sure how that impacts battery life, but I'd prefer the on/off be completely manual."
4,A Good Value,"I am mostly satisfied with this device. It seems to be easily accurate enough to serve my needs, and it is easy to use.The only reservation I have is that the cover for the battery compartment slides off too easily, often while I'm trying to make a meaurement. And the spare battery they send you doesn't stay put in the little indentation in the foam in the case, so every time you open the case the battery is floating around somewhere."
1,Just a converter now.,Basically you get what you paid for. I now just use it to convert standard to metric and vice versa. I should have sent it back.
1,Very poor product,"This item is not working. With trying both batteries included, the readings are so innacurate it is not even funny, the wheel is not smooth, and the lock screw affects the position of the jaws when tightened. I should have bought a standard non digital model. I am stuck with this and use it as a depth gauge. Did not return it as I was too much hassle. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!"
4,good buy,"Well it does what you need it to do. Not much more can be said. If you need a tool of this sort, than you will be happy with this one-I guarantee it! ... Though my guarantee is empty, that is you get nothing if I'm wrong but every thing if I'm right."
4,Best value for the money,"First off, no, it's not a Mitotoyo. It's not as smooth and doesn't inspire as much confidence.That being said it's very usable, accurate and good enough for home usage. I've had no problems getting consistent and accurate readings. For the price it's hard to beat. I wouldn't use it for a production environment but for home/hobby uses it's excellent!"
3,It Could've Been Better,"This digital caliper has a few nice features such as the ability to switch between decimal and metric, and auto-shutoff after a certain period of inactivity, but I think it's accuracy and stability could use a little improvement. This is nice for casual use, but I wouldn't use this caliper for anything truly critical.Ron"
4,cant beat the price,"came 3 days early, smooth operation, like the sae-metric conversion.handy storage case.can lock to repeat same size.so far so good"
5,Inexpensive tool that works!,"I purchased this caliper to confirm readings on a mechanical caliper already owned. Pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and accuracy. Only a few years back, this instrument would have cost ten times the price. Has SAE or metric capabilities, zero button, and accuracy to .001"" for under $20. Great as a stand alone or second device to verify. Yes, I would buy this again.I read other reviews how the screws came out or it malfunctioned in some other way. Please! This is a precision instrument, and as such, it should be carefully handled, and not thrown in a tackle box.If you have to do measuring work, this tool is easy to use. Comes in a plastic case with spare battery."
5,Remarkable value for the money,"Years ago I remember going to a large wholesale industrial supply company to pick up replacement calipers for one I dropped. I remember being awestruck at what they cost. Now I've bought this for my own personal use (making a 3d printer and need to calibrate), and I'm once again awestruck. This time by how much quality I can buy for so little money. It even comes with an extra battery and a pretty nice little foam lined case. I'm very pleased with the results too. The only thing I wonder about is a small cover near the battery compartment that exposes some contacts when opened. The tinkerer in me makes me wonder what they're used for... programming? calibration? data logging?"
5,"Precise, acceptable build quality, cheap","Measures things very accurately. I tested it on various guitar strings and it was spot on. (0.46"", 0.17"", 0.10"", etc...). Comes with an extra battery which is nice."
1,"Cheap, glithcy, dead! On a budget? Stick with analog!","I didn't want to spend a lot on calipers and bought these based on the good reviews. They worked fine right out of the box, but then the battery died after the first few uses (despite the auto shut-off). The second battery included was dead before I even used it (not surprising). After trying several different batteries, the thing never worked again. Getting them fixed will cost as much as I paid for them.My advice? If you don't want to spend a lot for reliable calipers, buy analog dial calipers and skip these cheap, glitchy electronics."
1,Don't waste you money,"I had high hopes for this tool, but it is disappointing me every time I use it. I don't know if it is just the one I have or all of them, but mine only seems to give semi correct measurements if the temperature is greater then 60 degrees. I've changed the battery's, taken it apart to clean it, with no change in performance. It will start working eventually, and only reliably for measurements under 2 inches,after that it goes nuts. From what I can tell almost all of these digital calipers are made by the same company in China, so other than spending the extra cash for a good Japanese set, I would just get a descent mechanical one, which is what I plan on doing."
2,too big,"I ordered this 6"" Caliper and what we got was a huge 9"".The thing is way too big for our uses.I'm very disappointed."
1,Crappy,Length:: 0:54 MinsCalipers did not work properly. Had tremendous amounts of error. I wasn't to satisfied with the build quality. Some nicks along the glide rail on the calipers caused it to not slide smoothly.
1,Useless tools,The readings taken with this tool were so unstable thattrying to use it became impossible.Jim D.
2,Poor quality,"I bought this a few months ago. Worked fine at first, right after purchase. Then I didn't touch it for 3-4 months and when I went to use it again, the battery was apparently dead - half of the digits did not illuminate. Kind of strange, as I expect my electronic items to maintain battery charge for a few months if I am not using it. I thought ""fine, at least these guys provided a spare battery"", replaced it, and tried again. Now the display was bright, but the electronic measurement was WAY off. Sometimes it would measure too little, sometimes it would end up at 500mm when I moved it maybe 25mm. That's not how it is supposed to work. I am not going to bother with replacement/warranty as this is a fairly cheap item, and it will work fine as a caliper, just not in the digital way. But I am quite disappointed."
1,Dead,"I've had this caliper just over a month and now its dead. I swap out the battery which still didn't resolve the problem. Maybe I just got a bad one, but its now out of the return window and I stuck with it. :("
3,"Works as designed, but a bit imprecise.","Works as designed, but imprecise. Once you return caliper to closed position, you need to zero it out, otherwise, it will show a few hundredths of millimeters."
3,"Works, but has its issues","I needed cheap calipers and these fit the bill... However when I started using it I realized that it was only reading half the distance. Every single time without fail, exactly half the distance was measured, until I removed the battery a couple times. Then it started working perfectly and is very accurate. This kind of instilled a little distrust in me though. But it seems to be working fine for now."
2,Flimsy,"This caliper is quite accurate and easy to work with. However, the fine adjustment wheel broke off the first time I used it. This instrument is fine for benchtop use but I would not recommend it for shop or automotive use. Buyer beware."
5,Sturdy and accurate,Bought this to measure small objects and have found that it works pretty well for my purposes. I checked its' accuracy against a number of objects that had clearly defined specifications (e.g. USB connector) and it accurately measured the width and height of the connector.It product seems sturdy and except for occasionally having to reset the zero I haven't found much criticism.
4,"Accurate and easy to use, not for high end","I picked this up for when I need to make simple depth measurements, or the outside/inside diameter of a pipe. It doesn't zero perfectly, so I doubt it's truly accurate to .001"" like a high end caliper would be. But when you need to know if a pipe is 27.2mm or 25.6mm, this will work perfectly. It might show ""27.3mm"" if you didn't zero it correctly, or opened it up too quickly, but if you know what you're looking for, and are careful with the measurements, this is a great tool.If you're looking for something really durable and high-precision, you'll still need to look into the $100-ish calipers, the quality difference will be obvious. But for what I need, this works perfectly."
3,"6"" Caliper","This is not a tool that should be used in a place of business; it will not last. However, for a homeowner or hobbyist this is reasonably priced tool that will most likely give years of service."
1,"Caliper has ""dead spots""","I had the caliper for a month and then needed to measure something to be 2.63"" when I got to 2.51 the tool started back at 2 again I found this in a few spots junk to me know would have been better off buying 4 at Harbor freight and trying my luck."
3,little flimsy,"if you need accuracy, spend the money and get yourself a quality caliper. I am using this for checking few different thread sizes. Little flimsy when it comes to overall quality."
1,Junk,"This Digital Caliper is junk. Wasted a lotta time and effort finding, buying, frustrated trying to make it work as advertised, returning...I need a digital caliper for a few measurements annually and thought this would suffice.It arrived with a dead battery.I put the spare battery included in the caliper and turned it on. The on/off button does not operate and thus needing the battery removed to turn it off without draining the battery.The inch/mm scale selection switch nor the zero'ng switch did not work either. A stick-on label on the back with conversion table was glued on crooked.There is NOTHING about this item of quality. It's junk. I returned for refund and purchased a higher priced, higher quality unit made in a country that takes pride in what they make, unlike this piece of junk.I've never written a review for an Amazon purchase. But the extreme low quality of this item motivated me to say something."
3,"Par for the course for offshore import ""precision"" parts.","First few goes had the unit measuring EXACTLY twice the correct length. Had to remove battery to reset, since then no problem."
5,great,"This caliper replaces one that cost more than twice as much which was discarded in disgust! This one works great,automatic on, always back to zero when closed, never switches units. I should get two of them!"
3,Works great for what it is...,"I got this set of calipers to use on my car for checking things like brake pad width and tire tread depth. For these things it works great. I'm not so sure that I would trust it for a whole lot more than that though. Because I work as an engineer in the medical device industry, we use the highest quality calipers on a daily basis. With that said, I can assure you that these are not the highest quality calipers around. But, for the price they are great. I give these calipers 3 stars simply because of the quality. If you are just going to use them for the same things I use them for, they will be more than perfect for you. If you need to make more critical measurements, please look elsewhere. At this price point though, I'm not so sure it gets a whole lot better than these..."
4,Good value,"For the price it does all I want it to. Its slide action is not as smooth and mechanical as higher quality calipers, but I wasn't expecting the best calipers I've ever used for $20. I use them to measure old road bike tube diameters and for that they seem to work fine."
3,Good tool for the money,"Good caliper for the money. For the guy that needs them only once in a while they are good. Dont forget to turn them off when you put them away, or the battery will be dead when you go to use them again."
1,DOA,"I recently ordered the Neiko 6"" SS caliper and was disappointed to find that it did not make repeatable measurements. Somewhere between 18 and 22 mm the caliper would magically gain 5.08mm (so that when you see 25mm on the scale, the digital readout has 30.08). I first thought this might be due to a weak battery, which I replaced with the spare included (no luck). I also thought that it might be due to the locking screw being loose which would allow the sensor to slip, but this also was not the case.In the end I am returning the caliper and will try a different brand. As usual, Amazon's shipping and return policy is top notch."
3,Good buy,it's kind of cheap because it mostly plastic but it definitely is a good purchase for the price . Works well for purpose.
5,Does The Job,"I received my caliper today and immediately put it to the test. I am very pleased with the performance, especially at this price point. I am using it for general automotive tasks as a do-it-yourself mechanic. I had decided to buy this after trying unsuccessfully to get an accurate measurement of the diameter of a sway bar using a tape measure. With this tool, the task was easily done in about 2 seconds. The tool feels surprisingly substantial and it includes a storage case and extra battery."
2,Quality is below par,"The quality of this caliper really is below par, the accuracy does seem to be okay but the slide continues to get more and more loose."
3,Doesn't Seem like a $45 tool,"While this device functions well, it seems to be pretty cheaply made. The slide seems loose, even with the top screw tightened, and the display pops on with the slightest bump, which is why I suppose they include an extra battery. I should point out I have little experience with this kind of tool- maybe that's all normal. On the other hand, it seems to work perfectly, and I'm glad I have it. For $16 its a good tool."
1,TMTCH Never born to follow,The title track is typically brilliant of the band's driving folk rock idiom but the rest of the album seems to hover around the banal. Does not reach the amazing heights of 'Waiting for Bonaparte' but is a worthy addition to your collection.
3,An interesting look at infidelity using poetry as medium.,"The topic of illicit love is given a different treatment in this short collection of poetry. Without glorifying or judging, the author, a relationship expert, explores infidelity from a number of different perspectives, always giving the reader food for thought. A quick and interesting read, it seeks to represent the different attitudes of the participants of secret relationships in a very accessible way, using short poems to convey thoughts and feelings, rather than a straightforward and more didactic discussion of the subject matter. I am impressed by the author's versatility, not only in style, but in giving many voices to a single topic."
4,Very good choice,"I bought this map sight unseen. I looked at maps in various bookstores and found them difficult to read and expensive. This turned out of be one of the most readable maps I've seen. The back has maps of various cities with very good detail (especially for Tokyo) on where hotels, points of interest, and train/metro stops are located.It has a durable cover, but it would be nice if the paper inside was more durable. It developed some tears after a few days of heavy use."
4,Japan travel map,The main reason I purchased this book was for the map of Japan. I could not find a reasonably priced map. I was not disappointed. The bonus was the city maps of Kyoto and Tokyo. This was a good reference for our travels in Japan. Compact size allowed me to take it on our day excursions. I would definitely buy another Globetrotter book.
2,Not a lot of detail,"Finding a good map for planning a vacation to Japan is turning out harder than I expected. I bought this map sight unseen hoping for the best. It turned out to be a disappointment.Pros:Good quality paper, cover and printing.Cons:Not much detail. Several towns I am planning to visit do not show on the map even though they are on the typical tourist trail.Does not show rail lines at all.I think the decision to show many cities in some detail took away the space on the map to show more detail at the national level."
3,Not what I expected,"The book has some ok recipes but it's really not what I wanted. I haven't tried any of the recipes yet but, it is good for getting ideas to put a meal plan together."
2,Historical Study,"The book isn't overwhelming with facts and is paced perfectly. He also has a habit of alluding to relationships or events that he only fully develops in later chapters, sometimes leading to a disjointed chronology Without giving away too much, let it be said that this book is, without question, a modern masterpiece of historical biography. Be prepared to make a commitment of time if you read this book. It is long and dense, but highly readable with many light moments. It's well worth your while."
1,Cheap plastic,"Second time I used this the plastic collar under the jar cracked and broke off. E-mailed the forman company asking where to obtain a replacement but got no reply. Searched the web for replacement, but found none. Wished I'd used it sooner so I could have sent it back; won't make that mistake again. Will never buy another foreman product.Why doesn't Amazon provide a way to give negative stars? Maybe someone could design a black hole to use as the symbol, in keeping with the astrological theme."
1,design problem,"While I liked the functions of the blender, it was nearly impossible to take apart to clean. There is a major design problem too, in that the bottom where the screw in is is all plastic and it broke after only a few uses. It is impossible to replace. This was a waste of money."
4,George's Turbo Blender,I bought this blender because George Forman endorsed it. He has been very successful with his grills. I have not had it long enough to really give it a good test. But so far it works really well. I wish there was something simpler that would not require taking apart and putting back together just to make a smoothie. Guess I am lazy!
1,***WAS***(past tense) a great product!,"As you can see from the above review, this USED TO BE a phenomenal product. What the previous reviewer appears to be unaware of though is that this is not the same old (excellent) ALmay product but a new and revised version in which Almay polluted the ingredients by adding propylene glycol (PPG, PEG, etc.), a common skin irritant and culprit in perioral dermatitis...A form of adult acne.For a company that likes to promote it's products as 'hypoallergenic', why add such a common allergen???? I don't get it!The 1 star was for the addition of salicylic acid, an excellent non irritating clarifying agent. If the addition of salicylic acid however necessitated the addition of propylene glycol, forget the salicylic acid."
1,Is Not Hypoallergenic,"Wear foundation every day, have tried many different kinds. This is the only foundation that has ever made my face break out in a terrible rash that covered my entire face. Very painful and embarrassing. You won't be able to wear makeup over it. Took two weeks before it was completely gone. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin."
1,Avoid this like the Plague!!!!!,"I bought this product from another dealer, and when it arrived it looked just like I expected. I charged the battery for the required 8 hours, hooked it up and...NOTHING HAPPENED!!!! No lights, no movement, nothing!I returned it to the dealer (at MY expense) and voila! 4 weeks later I got a replacement. Guess what? It didn't work either, and the antenna for the controller was missing. They shipped me someone elses crappy refurbished product! WTF?!? Avoid this product from anyone, DO NOT BUY IT! If there is a bright point, at least the guy in the first review was lucky, he didn't have to pay the return shippng!"
1,I was ripped off by this company!,"Ordered from this company and NEVER received the order. They claim is was delivered on a day I was home all day and refuse to resolve the issue. They do not respond to emails, calls etc. Ordering from this company is worst than gambling. You have a 99% chance of getting ripped off!"
4,"Interesting, but needs better editing","Henry's book is amazing - he attacks many misconceptions and unabashedly states things exactly as they really are.The problem is his inability to control his enthusiasm. He uses many great examples, but loses focus easily. For example, he'll state why affirmative action is bad, use an example of how blacks suffer from affirmative action, then point out that this is also a good example of what's wrong with education, then lead into a whole discussion on education in general, despite the fact that he's in the affirmation action chapter. Things like this happen frequently, and while the book is incredibly interesting and well-researched, it's occasionally difficult to follow. Sadly, this could be easily corrected by a more aggressive editor, such as by simply adding subsections to his chapters.Nonetheless, the book is interesting, entertaining, provocative, and above all thought-provoking, and transcends political ideology. Strongly recommended."
4,"Pompous, yet persuasive prose to ponder","Though I agree wholeheartedly with many, if not most, of the author's ideas on education, multiculturalism, Afrocentrism and affirmative action, and, guardedly, with his overall thesis, his presentation will probably sway many in the opposite direction due to the overwhelming stench of his pretensions. He is blatantly pretentious, and thus his writing style damages rather than furthers his ideological, philosophical and political viewpoints. Nevertheless, this novel does provide a fascinating glimpse into the mind of an esoteric Ivy Leaguer and a veritable cornucopia of food for thought, provided one is not disgusted by the chewy and overdone pomposity and verbosity of the ever lugubriously loquacious author."
4,"Insightful, but cranky","I enjoyed reading this book, and found myself agreeing with many of his arguments.That being said, at times he seems to devolve into a cantankerous old fuddyduddy (e.g. less pictures of family).Likewise, it would have been nice if he had provide an action plan, or some suggestions as to how one might be able to encourage a return to elitism.As he states, many of the issues he raises are considered taboo in our increasingly egalitarian society. That alone is well worth the read.Written in 1994, it is interesting to his how his predictions play out, and how many of the problems he raises have gotten even worse.A change is long past due.p.s. I would love it if someone could suggest another book in the same vein as this one."
4,"Excellent discussion of what it really means to be ""elite.""","People who say the word ""elite"" with a sneer have no concept of what it really means. Mr. Henry explains what I have long suspected -- that being ""elite"" is not the same thing as being a snob. This is an excellent book that I recommend for anyone who gets the two concepts confused."
2,"""Elitism"" is abundant on attacks, but scarce in substance","Mr. Henry is admired for saying in this book what others have apparently wanted to say for some time. That is, unfortunately, all he does. The book makes broad generalizations with very little evidentiary support. It is fluent ranting, but far from an intellectual pursuit. Mr. Henry set up straw men in those he opposed, making even his most resonant points questionable empirically. He uses the language well, but has difficulty with the evidence."
4,"Good, but not her best!","I started reading the Death Serious years ago and, although I could always figure out `who done it', I still missed the mystery that was absent in Seduction In Death. It seemed more emphasis was put on personal relationships than on the murder plot. I've read most of J.D. Robb's books one day, this one took two. It's not that it's a bad book, it just the style seemed to be more early Nora Roberts than J.D. Robb. But I still enjoyed the book, would recommend the book and, will definitely continue reading the series."
5,EXCELLENT!,"Just can't get enough of Eve Dallas! I've sped through 18 of these books, and now I'm bummed there's so few left to read! Highly recommended series."
1,"Great book, awful recording","I've been an avid fan of the series since it's beginning. I'm on my second time through them. This time I'm listening to the audio versions. The previous recordings have been fabulous. Susan Ericksen is so talented. But this one..... She changed the voices and dropped most of the accents and idiosyncracies. It's like losing friends. It also makes it much harder to follow and tell who is speaking - all the women sound the same! Susan, please, bring back the voices!!!! The book itself is great, as always"
3,"Good enough story, utterly bland recording!","One of the things I thoroughly enjoyed about the ""In Death"" series was the wonderful range of voices the narrator gave the characters, especially the sly and distinctive voice of Peabody. I don't know WHAT the director of this recording was thinking, but Peabody sounds like mini-Eve, Mavis barely sounds like herself, Treena barely has any umph -- even the male voices are hard to tell apart. Only Roarke still sounds like himself. My first time through the series, I was really upset because I didn't know that things were going to get better.For those who are just going through the series the first time and who are as distressed as I was, it gets a little bit better with #14, ""Reunion in Death,"" and things are back to normal with #15, ""Purity in Death."" Keep the faith, folks must have given lots of feedback because the voices we came to love do come back!Aside from that, a solid story, just a really disappointing recording. Points off for that."
5,Awesome,Great book have listened to and own the entire series. Wonderful story line lots of action and romance. Love the connection of friends and co workers that Eve has. Fairy tale come true. I have all the audios and listen to them when ever I am in my car. I have shared these with friends and they also cannot wait until they can get their hands on the next one.
3,Losing steam,"The book was good, but compared to the earlier books in the series, the writing's gone stale, flat somehow... In short, it's not as interesting as it used to be. The dynamic between Roarke and Eve is mellower now, but there's no sense of being inspired to write the book, and hence to read it as often as you would the older ones. Besieds, the villains getting revealed waaay too early on and getting so much space of their own is a sign that there's nothing else to write about, and that's a problem."
5,J D Robb,Any book by this author - whether its penned under J.D. Robb or Nora Roberts - is a keeper! I now have the entire collection!
4,Seduction in Death,I really really liked this one! It was very inventive and creative. A great addition to the series and I can't wait to start the next one.
3,Unlucky 13,"Nora Roberts (writing as J.D. Robb) is a brilliant writer. She's able to weave a tale that entertains, enraptures and imprisons the senses. You are left spellbound by her grasp of storytelling and her expert use of language...BUT...This story falls short of many of her previous stories. (And many that came after.) The plot is generic and rehashed. The only originality is the fact that the Casanova tale takes place in the future.She puts an interesting spin on it, which is why she gets 3 stars instead of 1 or 2, but this is one of the weaker stories in the series if you ask me."
5,Great book!,"This was the book that got me hooked. I picked up a copy off a free book pile and immediately after finishing went and bought the whole series. I don't do what I did. Start from the first book. (Glory) You'll be hooked for sure.Reviewed by Rosanna Filippello Author of the Angelo Mysteries Series published by JustMyBest inc. Book One--Angel of Death, Book Two--Angelo of Justice(Angel of Truth to be released Fall of 2005)www.detective-angelo-mysteries.com"
3,Average,"This is the first book I have read from this author. The characters have great dialouge and the idea behind the book is interesting. But you will basically know the ending by the middle of the book. I must say I don't like the character of Roarke. He comes of as pushy and a sexist. Is that supposed to be a turn on? I'm not sure. I did like Eve, however."
3,Cool RC,"This is not a toy for a small child, this is a model with speed. It only works in the water so don't think it is broken when it doesnt work on dry land."
2,Three-legged dog,"This hammer is great!It is well-balanced and hits hard.The side-strike feature and the magnetic nail holder work very well.Handle replacement(if you ever need it!)will be easy.The head shape is very good also.Excellent side nail puller.Why,if I love it so much,did I only rate it 3 stars?The claws on this hammer are,at best,[unacceptable]!If you would like to hollow out a log canoe this is your tool.I have beat ... many a board when trying to pull walls around.The indented waffles are passable.If this hammer had Estwing type claws it would be the best framing hammer ever.I had to downgrade my rating because the handle broke in less than 2 weeks!I will buy a new handle and try it again.Right now I'd spend half the money and buy a Stanley Fat Max!"
5,it puts tha hamma in hammer,"this hammer is the rebirth of the original Hart ""Woody"" a model that was to good so they got rid of it. this hammer makes pounding nails fun. It has a magnetic nail set for the hard to reach places and the nail puller is almost effortless to use. Thank you Douglas for returnig the best frammer ever made back to us. The replacable hanlde system makes this hammer the last one you'll ever need. Check this hammer our if you are a serious builder."
3,"So, So Video Quality","The show ""Mork & Mindy"" is a pretty good show. Pam Dawber, Robin Williams, and Elizabeth Kerr were great in it.But the video quality [is quite poor]! It is recorded in SLP/EP mode. Now, this is okay for shows that are released in black and white, but not for shows in color. The image looks like it was recorded off TV, and the episodes were the standard cut versions that were shown on Nick at Nite from 1991-1995, and the now dead FOX Family Channel. They could've either:A: Included more episodes for our money, orB: Have Taped it in SP Mode if They Only Wanted Two Episodes On ItI think another company other then Paramount Video should release ""Mork & Mindy"" and it's sister series, ""Happy Days"" and ""Laverne & Shirley"""
3,Where are the rest?,"Ho-Hum. Yes, it has some standout tracks. However, I know I'm not the only one waiting for a CD with ALL of Mike Post's theme songs - the ORIGINAL versions too - from Rockford Files to Magnum PI to NYPD Blue and Law & Order with all of the other great themes from the 70s and 80s in between. Is this ever going to happen, I wonder! And, doesn't anyone remember his 45 from 1975 titled ""Manhatten Spiritual""? What a great song that you can't find anywhere."
1,Demon-possessed kids anyone?,"Mr Pullman has created a truly insideous work that glorifies Satanism and undermines the source of purity in our world. Unfortunately this book has captured the imagination of many young people who are oblivious to the concepts of worldview and the schemes of a corrupt author.Parents should strongly investigate this series, considering the author himself says that Satan is actually an advocate of wisdom and freedom."
5,Amazing!!,"This book closes the His Dark Materials Trilogy with a bang! The action in the final battle of The Authority's forces is thrilling. Some people state that the name of this book is misleeding, but the amber spyglass is just as instrumental to stop the evil as any of the other magical instruments in the series. Mary Malone also has a great contribution, for if she didn't tell Will and Lyra stories of her life, they probably would never have fallen in love and stopped the flood of Dust leaving the world. Mary plays a subtle serpent, but a very effective serpent nonetheless. Kudos to Pullman!!"
3,A Bang into an Adolescent Whimper,"Despite Pullman's never subtle dislike of Christianity, I find these books compelling. Pullman is a wonderful writer, gifted with language. I managed to swallow his anti-Christian rhetoric because of his writing skill and because his critique of Christianity stands on the very worldview it attacks.That said, I was weary of the evermore explicit anti-religious diatribes by the end of this final book. The characters make little speeches about the perils of authority, the evils of the Church, the ""mistake"" of Christianity, and the need for a Republic of Heaven instead of a Kingdom of Heaven. The story could've ended with a bang but trickled on needlessly into the whimpers of adolescent love. On the whole, however, the trilogy has strengths which manage to outweigh these weaknesses. A thoughtful and open-minded reader (exactly what Pullman claims to want) should manage to enjoy a good story while discovering the Christian truth Pullman unwittingly voices."
1,Disorganized thought,"My main problem with this book is that it left too many things unexplained... like if God was dying, then what was there before God? The ideas that were put forth in the first two books led me to think that the author would have some magnificent explanation and ending. I was severely disappointed. The book was not cleverly written; the author seemed to be able to form the beginnings of a story but could not take us to a satisfactory conclusion. It was an irregularly woven tale."
4,A Thrilling Journey,But a bit lackluster with the ending like Is that all there is? Killing off of a lot of people and releasing the atoms of the dead to the world?
4,good audio book,"interesting story with a full cast of voices. Pullman takes a long time to finish up the narrative, but it's probably necessary. no bad music in this volume, but the poetry at the beginning of each chapter is hard to get when read quickly out loud. it adds nothing to this audio version. that part would make more sense in print."
4,3rd time is a charm!,"Of all of the Dark Material Series, The Amber Spyglass was certainly my favorite. The creativity of the writer in all of the books within this series is excellent but the last books really takes the cake. For me, if a writer has to spend a great deal of time explaining the mindset of the characters, then they are not always doing their job within the rest of the story. Pullman does a great job spinning a yarn without the need to bloviate about the charters state of mind. The adventure speaks for itself...as it should be!"
4,It could have been better,"I agree with the other reviewers that the whole battle with the Kingdom of Heaven wrapped up entirely too quickly and simply. And then you have a huge question of what's going on between the warring factions now that the leaders have destroyed each other. I agree also that it's not 100% clear what the temptation was and which way she went with it. But that's part of the reason it sticks with you. It's true there's no closure with the parents, but sometimes in life there's no closure and you just have to deal with it. It's also not 100% clear, or even implied that the kids had sex. I'm frankly surprised people assume they did. Were you ever 12-years-old in the woods? I was. And we just kissed alot. But it was alltheworld to us.The rest is pretty satisfactory. I cried like a baby, I still get weepy when I think about it. I'm halfway through reading it to the kids and I know I'm going to cry again."
5,A MUST READ BOOK !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"In the last book of the Dark Material trilogy, many things happen. Dr. Mary Malone from the Subtle knife is back. She is stuck in a world with creatures called mulefa. Lyra is capture by Mrs. Coulter and is put in a enchanted sleep. Will meets two angels called Balthamos and Baruch. (...) I really liked this book.I think this book and the Subtle Knife is the best of the trilogy. The Second and Third book connect way better that the first and second. Both are definatly better than the first book, Not that I don;t like the first book. I recommend this book to everyone."
4,Wonderful end to Lyra's adventures,"It was so sad. .. i must admit. I was moved to tears at the last scenes of this book. It was a thrilling read but I thought that the series was getting a little boring towards the end. Perhaps I was out of the mood because it had been such a long time since I had read the previous two books. Neverhteless, it was a good read. Some parts seemed to drag on forever. But hey if you have read the first two books... definately definately finish off the series and find out the conclusion. Well written."
3,the Amber Spyglass review,"The recording of THE AMBER SPY GLASS was wonderful. I enjoyed listening to the many different actors. I was disappointed with the ending of the triology. The first part was exciting and different. Then, Mr. Pullman's story began losing it's grip. The whole triology is an interesting listen, but I guess I was hoping for the ""grab"" of HARRY POTTER or LORD OF THE RINGS. I didn't find that. I did find unique character development and wished the plot could have supported those interesting characters a bit more."
2,Disappointed,"I enjoyed both the first and second books. By comparison, the ""Amber Spyglass"" is inferior - almost amateurish in its storytelling. There are several story lines that are not resolved satisfactorily. The conclusion is hardly as epic as the earlier story hyped it up to be. The connections to Eve and rebirth are tenuous at best. One can sort of see what Pullman was attempting, but it just did not work out. It's almost as if a different author wrote this book.If this had been the first book, I would have given up reading the rest of the trilogy on the spot."
5,Great Book if you read it as a literary work,"Hello,This is a great book if you read as it is intended to be, a literary work. However, there will be debates for years to come about it's ""Christian themes"". I am a Christian and a devout one at that. However, I support all literature and I am against banning of any book. For all those right wing Christians who believe this book should be banned, let me say this. If we ban this book, we might as well ban the bible, for that is what will happen. Please do not infer any deep religious connection to this book. Read it for what it is, a retelling of Milton's paradise lost. Hopefully, Pullman will continue the series and write something on Milton's pardise regained. In any case, this book is a way to examine your beliefs. I have read it and my beliefs have been strenghted do to there examination. Thanks"
4,"Good, but missing something","I really enjoyed the first two books, and liked part of the third, but I was disappointed that The Amber Spyglass fails to fill the symmetry set up by the other books. They create the clear expectation that the amber spyglass and its bearer will join the other sacred objects and bearers in an equal balance of power to bring an end to the evils going on in the world. But the spyglass enters the book late, and does not seem to have any effect whatsoever on the plot. Dr. Malone, rather than filling the final space in the structure of power, does almost nothing of any significance. Her actions, it seems, have very little effect in the end. I think that this book got off to a good start, but did not go as far as it should have. I really liked the final role of Coulter and Asriel, and the fact that the final death of The Authority had no effect whatsoever."
4,"Good, but not as satisfying as the first two.","After the first two books, I was jumping up and down with anticipation when I got my hands on this one. It has a very clever plot and fascinating characters, but sometimes it sort of, well, lost interest for a while. Whereas with the first two I couldn't put them down, this one I sometimes wanted to skip ahead a few pages when it got boring. Still a worthwile read though. One tip: Re-read the first two books before you start it or you'll be very confused at the beginning."
1,Carelessly slapped together and unsatisfying....,"I think Pullman could have done a much better job in this series. The first book was so interesting and engaging, with great characters, especially a strong female lead. But book 2 and especially the new book 3, the Amber Spyglass, did not live up to what was begun in the Golden Compass. Characters change from good to evil without decent explanations, and important plot developments from book one are tritely dismissed with a phrase such as ""I lied,"" because Pullman cannot come up with a good explanation. On a separate note, Pullman takes what could be an interesting exploration of different religious beliefs and simplifies it into shallow anti-catholic ravings."
5,"Get it right, please","I'm not going to waste your time telling my opinions of this book by rephrasing the glowing reviews, but I am going to correct an error in the less positive ones: many people say that the spirits' being called ""daemons"" is Satanic. I wish people would get their facts right before they criticize such a wonderul piece, because it is not true: the word ""daemon"" spelt with a break between the a and the e means soul in Greek, and ""daimon,"" in the same language, means spirit, friend and guardian angel. I thought I would clear that up."
3,Disappointing ending for trilogy,"The Golden Compass absolutely enthralled and captivated me, and the Subtle Knife was also quite beguiling. But this third book was a letdown. There were some thrilling moments: three kids running down a path, suddenly being confronted by three guards, as an armored bear is rushing in to help them, an angel intercedes and two miniature spies swoop in on their golden dragonflies! But fearsome characters introduced in the beginning (the assassin, for example) meet their ends without having been of any real threat to their targets, monstrous creatures of the Dead world suddenly become cohorts with Lyra and Will. The final battle was horrifically confusing: it was hard to follow what and who were fighting, and I couldn't figure out how big this battle was supposed to be. And what was the thing about the scientist acting as ""the serpent""? All the big, portentious elements put in place early in the book and in the trilogy seem to come to nought."
3,The weakest part of three,"Sometimes if you have to wait too long for a book expectations run too high and disappointment is close at hand. But sometimes the reason for having to wait too long can be found in the problems the author may have had with his story. I loved the first two books in the series, but I was not enchanted by the third. No doubt, this is still a good book and has memorable moments. But the magic somehow has gone, the plot seems awfully constructed and I had the impression that the author just could not handle all strands of this ambitious work with the same deftness as previously - and inadvertently resorted to ""deus ex machina"" solutions. The book usually starts to glow where Lyra and Will are involved, but Asriel's/Mrs. Coulter's battle against the Church and Metatron which takes up a lot of space was rather a cheap thrill."
2,Devastatingly disappointing,"The first two books take you on an amazing, wonderful rollercoaster ride, only to have the third book hurl you into a whole other direction that is diappointing and confusing. I was so upset to fall in love with Lyra and Will to end up with a bunch of anti-God speeches and a sad ending. The anti-christian message in this book becomes apparent by the end of book two and just gets hammered in throughout book 3. At websites devoted to His Dark Materials there are quotes about Pullman using these books to counteract the Chronicles of Narnia and God. As a parent, I would be disturbed to have my young children (target audience) read how Man/Woman is the saviour of us all. There is no way a parent would know that this is what the books are really about. They are so beautifully written; the third book just broke my heart. If children read this, parents should read it with them. Lots to discuss."
3,Made it through the series...,"This is the 3rd and final book in the Pullman triology, and it was just good enough that I managed to finish it. I think I might have even enjoyed these books as a child, but they don't translate well to adult-readers like better childrens books do. I found the characters too simplistic and the science too abominably implausible (and I do like sci-fi and fantasy) to recommend this book for grownups. Each book does pick up the pace and get interesting in the last 50 pages or so... getting just good enough to convince me to pick up the next book and get disappointed again. At least book 3 is better than book 2, but book 1 was still the best in my opinion (before the science and theology got too out of control).One thing I do appreciate about this edition is the paper/font/printing. I chose it over the trade paperback edition because it looked more inviting to read. Without that, I probably never would have made it as far as book 3."
3,Some nice elements but an unsatisfying conclusion,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books of this series, and while there were some nice moments in ""The Amber Spyglass"" there were also some extremely poor choices made by the author.The major flaw with these books was not the War in Heaven struggling against the Authority (I actually thought the use of the subtle knife in this scene was clever and well done).The problem was the sudden change in Lyra's parents. Their 180 degree turn from the previous books was extremely bad characterization. Sadly, the author chose to make his plot hinge on the unrealistic motivations of these characters.Despite that, I found the ending very moving.I have mixed feelings about ""The Amber Spyglass"". If Pullman would have made the change in his antagonists believable this would be a 5 star reccomendation. Unfortunately, he didn't. The series thus has failed to reach its true potential."
1,Betrays our trust in a talented writer's story,"Yuck. This was a very disappointing book. Pullman is a great writer with considerable talent, which makes this book all the more of a let down. I loved the first two and hoped the conclusion wouldn't degenerate into christian-bashing, but in the end it is mostly for atheists raising atheist children. Its shaky conceptual foundations are best described as a haphazard mix of greek mythology and plain-vanilla secular humanism. There are many, many logic gaps. The worst thing about this book is that it is for children. Adults can dismiss the nonsensical philosphical junk, but kids are more impressionable. After writing two stellar novels for children and garnering rave reviews, Pullman betrays the trust of all faith-based families with this third volume. I'm not a raving right-wing conservative, but this book offended me, and it could have a damaging effect on the faith of impressionable children.Not recommended."
4,Not as good as I expected.,"The religious sections of this story made it very hard to read because with such a good book, this has a very odd view of God. I don't mind it since I'm strong in the Christian faith, but it was so.............well, appalling. However, besides that, the whole book was completely interesting, whether it was because of answers to some questions that were throughout the series, whether it was love, action, death, battles, evil schemes, and sad partings. Philip Pullman has a wonderful gift in writing, and he has a way of getting people to feel emotional (I weeped at the end). A good conclusion to the series."
3,Enough loose ends to knit a sweater out of.,"The powerful imagery and great visual scenes in this book is undoubtedly what makes it so popular. But like all of Pullman's books, it suffers from egregious logical lapses and loose ends. For example, one character flees his own world because he's wanted by the police for murder: when he goes back to his world, there's no further mention of him being wanted for murder. It's never clear exactly what the two main characters did to save the world, nor why it worked. I have a list of about thirty inconsistencies off the top of my head, but listing them here might spoil the book for those who want to read it.There are some great scenes. I do think, however, that Pullman needs to work on cohesion if he wants his books to survive for more than a few years."
2,This is a stupid book!,"** The book is so confusing. And what the heck is the point of the mulefa things? If this book isn't even about the Amber Spyglass, why even call it that? Mary Malone's adventures are STUPID and what are they suppose to mean to the story????!!! What's the point of the World of the Dead? I have to give credit for Lyra and Will's adventures; they were probably the most exciting plotlines in the story. I liked the Golden Compass and the Subtle Knife better. And why, Pullman, WHY, did you make God the enemy? Are you even aware that millions of people believe in Christianity? Halfway through the book, I closed it, and never opened it again! 2 stars"
5,"Incredible, poignant","Easily one of the best books I've ever read. Pullman puts just about every other author to shame. Just be prepared for the end, I'll say no more."
5,Buy this book. Read It.,"The Amber Spyglass is an exiting finish to the His Dark Materials Series. The story is about two children, a universal war, three mystical artifacts, and a mysterious substance called ""Dust"". The plot unfolds amazingly, the characters are brilliantly shown, and the world is extremely complex. I suggest anyone older that 10 that has read the others in this series to read this book. The bottom line is: Buy this book. Read it."
5,Excellent story,"I have enjoyed the entire series of 'His Dark Materials'. The story is intriguing and thought-provoking. The characters have amazing depth and are so easy to relate to. I gave this series to my husband, who has turned down all the kids' books I've given him before and even he has greatly enjoyed this series. The story encourages readers of all ages to think for themselves, but most importantly to think about life and its meaning and importance. The most amazing part is that the book was able to encourage a spiritual perspective on life without isolating the story to one particular religious sect's experience. It's more about the human religious experience, which starts at a very young age, but so few kids books approach it. I cannot sing this author's praises enough."
4,Enjoyable,"I read the Golden Compass....and then a while after, came across the Subtle Knife....which made me go back to The Compass, and then on to the Amber Spyglass.I am definitely going to re-read this book, because in my opinion, there is a whole lot going on which is hard to grasp the first time. I have to say, that at this point, the first two books grabbed me more, but I enjoyed the Spyglass, and will read it again.In any case, I truly believe that this trilogy stands out among all the bland sci-fi-fantasy books out there, which drag on and on. In fact, I think it would make a great movie, too!"
3,I got lost somewhere...............,"It may have been the time period between the second book and when the third got published. I found this trilogy better than most fantasy out there today, though it seemed to flounder and become confused as if the author was not sure how to end it or come to a climax. There are also parts where new qualities or features that turn up anew in this novel are explained away with a single sentence, leaving a contrived feeling sometimes. All said, I would recommend it for the fantasy reader out there....but maybe from the library."
5,This book is better than Harry Potter!!,"This book is better than Harry Potter. It is about how Lyra and Will go through everything--worlds, seperating from their daemons, Lyra meeting her death and seeing others' deaths, and how they save everything from the ablyss. It is heart breaking in the end, but I must tell you they aren't the ones killed. Lyra goes to Will's Oxford and Mary Malone, you'll met her later, meets ""creatures on wheels"" or the mulefa, it is a great book and will leave you thinking about it over and over."
3,Not what you expected,"The book starts out fine (though I find it hard to get back into the plot after waiting for three years.)He ruins the book by making it all religious and adding stuff about the underworld. PLus he seperates Will and Lyra right when they figure out they're in love, though they're only 12 or something. Just when I start to like her parents he throws them in a bottomless pit. Also, I don't see how the scientist lady tempted them, what happened to Will and school, and wasn't Asriel trying to kill the authority? what happened to that? I got really confused. So I guess just cuz I couldn't put the book down, doesn't mean it was the perfect finish for the series."
5,Heartbreaking,"Have you ever read a book that literally broke your heart? If not, you are missing out on one of life's greatest experiences - and you should immediately read Pullman's trilogy, in particular, The Amber Spyglass. Pullman's exploration of religion and its place in human life may be impressive and thought-provoking, but the greatest feat of his trilogy is to make you feel not only FOR the main characters but THROUGH them as well. When Lyra and Will's deep friendship develops into an intense love, you experience it along with them. Pullman makes it seem so pure and true, you envy these fictional characters - you want that love for yourself, even though it is impossible to achieve. And when they are torn apart forever, if you have a heart, it breaks. At the end of this amazing story, you are left feeling shattered, and maybe angry at Pullman for putting you through this experience. But it is well worth the pain."
5,A Fantastic Conclusion To A Mesmerizing Trilogy,"I honestly can't remember a book that I've savored literally chapter by chapter. Not wanting this triumphant trilogy to come to a close, I'd only allow myself one chapter in the morning when I woke up and one before I went to bed. Having just completed it I feel like my head has just expanded. Pullman continues through the worlds we've come to know with Will and Lyra and takes us to some new and wildly original ones such as the world of the dead, and the village of the mulefa.(Don't ask. The beauty in this is his desciptions of both.) Already I've bought the first book, ""The Golden Compass"" for friends of mine so I'll have someone else to talk with about this.The books have gotten stronger each time out, and this one is the tops. I also appreciated that Pullman has plenty of opportunity to dip into sentimentality, but chooses instead to write with careful restraint; the result being a moving and perfect ending."
2,Disappointing ending,"There's no real way to put this other than to say that this book was a jumbled mess. It was such a promising series at the beginning with such strongly and wonderfully drawn characters but, in the end, it seemed like Pullman had no idea what to do with them. The plot of this book was rather nonsensical--and, at times, nonexistent--and while I have some serious critiques of my own about the church, the book seemed to be nothing more than a vehicle for Pullman to air his views about the evils of Catholicism. It's a shame as this could have been a truly astonishing series. In spite of the strength of the first two books, in the end it's not really a worthwhile read."
3,The Cracked Amber Spyglass,"The Amber Spyglass was a dismal conclusion to Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy. I am desperately trying to make sense of what I read. Pullman went off on too many tangents in this finale - Balthamos and Baruch; the mulefa (huh??), Metatron; the senile ""Authority""; the love story between Will and Lyra, the flow of the Dust or Sraf into the netherworld; Instead of tying together loose ends, Pullman introduces too many unrelated and ridiculous elements which greatly detract from the initial story's credibility. The finale fails in that itintroduces and then unsuccessfully tries to address too many gargantuan themes. I would have just been content with a thorough and plausible explanation of Dust and its relation to the Subtle Knife."
3,"OK, but not as good as I was led to believe","after reading all three of the books in the series, I'm underwhelmed. the first two books are OK, but this final book was thin, not well put together, and unsatisfying.The characters in general are not well-formed but the two adults who drive the story -- the main character's parents -- were well-high incomprehensible to me. The seemed to be a spate of killing off characters that the author couldn't figure out what to do with. It just seemed a hash of clashing ingredients.I really got the sense there was more material than the author could use and he just ended up squeezing it in. I think fans of the Narnia books (I don't like them either) may find these to their taste."
3,A overly-long book at slow pace,"I have to say, I absolutely loved ""The Golden Compass"" when I read it a month ago, and I was a little disapointed with ""The Subtle Knife"", but I really did think that ""The Amber Spyglass"" was a overly-done book, no offense to Mr. Pullman. Pan and Lyra don't really have that ""connection"" anymore, which is what I think made me like BOOK 1 in the HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy. READ ""THE GOLDEN COMPASS"" and maybe you'll like all 3 books-don't let my opinion ruin yours of these books! Just don't expect much from books 2&3 if you're comparing them to book 1."
2,Overblown,"I'm sorry. I know it;s popular to praise Phillip Pullman as if he were the new writing god, but please. The Golden Compass was great. The Subtle Knife devolved into that awful Oxford literary crap, with stupid biblical allegory. This is a complex but overblown book. I am glad the trilogy is over, and pray that he doesn't add to it."
3,OK,"This book is really 3.5 stars. Philip Pullman had a great story idea for his books, but I thought he made them much too religiously orianted. This book has well-devoloped charecters, a good plot, and many other good things. If you like sci-fi or fantasy, I would suggest that you buy this book. :-)"
4,Good Writing but not quite the Magic Touch of the other two,"Phillip Pullman's 3rd His Dark Materials Book is beautifully written and the more you read Pullman the more you realise what a genius he must be. The story line is a slight disapointment after Northern Lights and The Subtle Knife both of which sucked you into the dark, strange world of Phillip Pullman's mind. In this book Pullman displays his knowledge and descriptive power but can't quite capture the magic. Still, it's not that bad a book."
5,Amber Spyglass is stunning,"""The Amber Spyglass"" is a wonderfull book. For this book to fully reach audiance expectations, it would have to be evan greater than ""The Golden Compass"" and ""The Subtle Knife"". ""The Amber Spyglass"" easily reaches, and surpasses, expectations. Pullman magically weaves his stories with incredible suspense, beautifull language, and charecters who we all love and wish we could know. This book neatly ties up loose ends left by the earlier two. It is a story of bravery and sacrifice. It is both thrilling and heart wrenchingly sad. We readers could not have asked for anything more."
2,Runs out of Gas-Hidden Theme,"I enjoyed the first 2 books in the trilogy however ""The Amber Spyglass"" seemed to wander on and on. In the end the author uses the book to promote his personal views of God and Christianity. I was dissappointed in this because I didn't expect to find anti-Catholic, atheistic views at the end of a children's book. I expected something more along the lines of CS Lewis Narnia. Upon further investigation I found that Pullman detests the Naria series and seems to be the antithesis of CS Lewis. Pullman should have stuck to the fantasy aspect of his series and left his personal viewpoints at home."
1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!","I used to make fun of David Eddings online because of the the deus-ex-machina way he treats his characters' abilities to get out of trouble. This series makes David Eddings look like Shakespeare.This whole series is a collection of the most horribly out-of-character moments, out-of-nowhere resolutions, unexplained characters' abilities and knowledge of things, and the worst randomly created plot points in the history of writing.I can't believe that the author Terry Brooks recommended these books to me. Curse you Terry Brooks!"
1,Major Disappointment,"I was so disappointed in the Amber Spyglass. Poor plot and character development, plus I hated the ""God is Dead"" theme. I loved the first two novels, and actually bought a the third in hardback cause I couldn't wait for a paperback. I am adult, and have read hundreds of science fiction and fantasy novels, but I would never encourage a young person to read this novel. The anti-Catholic and anti-Christian philosophy was very offensive. I am so disappointed by the conclusion of the trilogy."
1,Disappointing third part in the trilogy,"I loved ""The Golden Compass"" and liked ""The Subtle Knife,"" but the third in the trilogy, ""The Amber Spyglass"" disappointed me. What a sad, empty ending for this brave girl and boy!"
4,One of the best!!,"I think that this book was so, so, awesome. I have read The Golden Compass and that seems to revolve around Lyra(love that name), the girl in the book, her ""golden compass"", and her history, life, and world. The second, The Subtle Knife, is mostly about Will's life, his going through worlds, and acceptance of the subtle knife.I REALLY wish that Mr. Pullman had written more books, because they kind of leave you hangin at the end, just saying ""Ok, now lets build the republic of Heaven."" and end of book. And also with Will and Lyra's relationship, ""Right, let's meet every year, in our seperate worlds, at this same bench, so we can still always be together, even if we're all grown up.""My favorite book of the whole series is the Subtle Knife, because of all the suspense with the power of the knife, and what Will and Lyra do with it. I like the way with all of the books they switch from what one person is doing to another with each chapter.P.S. READ LORD OF THE RINGS,ITS GREAT!"
3,Rushing to conclusions,"I really loved ""The Amber Spyglass"" and I thought ""The Subtle Knife"" was great, too: intellectually intriguing, engrossing, and well-crafted. I hate to be a nay-sayer, but I really thought the story fell flat in this final installment. Pullman is amazingly ambitious in this trilogy--so ambitious that he has simply has gotten in over his head by Vol. 3. To effectively pull all the various threads together that he has started working with in Vols. 1 and 2, he would need about three more books--not one--in my opinion. I thought this third book felt rushed throughout. Its pace was totally different than the other two books. I also thought the ""love story"" part came out of left field and was a little weird and off-putting. (I'm sure others will disagree with me on that.)All that said, I still think this series as a whole is well-worth reading, and would give it four stars overall."
1,"Great book, trashy ending","I started out with anticipation. The first two books were great. By the time this one ended I was very disappointed. I don't mind Pullman's anti-christian polemic so much, lame and contradictory as that is. The thing that annoyed me most is the portrayal of pre-teen infatuation and sexual discovery as the savior of the universe. Very silly and irresponsible. Let's tell kids that puppy love is the glue that holds everything together. I wouldn't put it on any recommended parents' list."
5,A book i would totally reccomend,"Philip Pullmans writing is a fascinating mixture of fantasy and reality and the result is a masterpiece of literature. When Lyra first begins her jourey she is just an innocent little girl with nothin really spectacular about her. But as you read on you find yourself in a complex twist of emotions and adventure. For example, Lyra is growing up, and she now has to nmake decisions for herself and now, instead of being a little girl;, she has become a person, capable of rising up to any situation. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and i would highly reccomend it."
2,A painful third installement,"Much as I enjoyed the first 2 of His dark material, I found the third one overly long, overly complex with parts too similar, in my view, to ""Out of the silent planet"". I totally lost interest in Mary Malone's doings and there were just too many parallel stories and plots, I became impatient with it all. Disappointing and too ambitious."
5,Amazingly Brilliant,"I was lokking forward to this book since I finished the other two and as soon as I had it in my hand and I laid my eyes on the first page my heart began to race. And thats what I did for 3 days. Each page was so brilliant. It was amasing watching the characters develop, watchig lyra mature and Will learn. When something happened to them it felt like it happened to you. With most sequals they get worse, if anything his got better. I treasured every second I spent reading it. Anyone who likes reading will love this book."
5,"Sniff, loved it, don't get me wrong!","This series is a personal, absolute favorite of mine, among others. Obviously beautifully and glorifully (is that a word?) written, and the character developement is stunning. I cried completely (balling my eyes out!) at the end, and at the part with Mrs. Coulter, Lord Asriel, and Metatron. Should NOT pass up a chance to read. I've reread it many times, and it's never lost its novelty. GO TO YOUR STORE AND BUY IT TODAY! -Middle school reader (an avid one at that)"
2,Very Disappointing,"Very disappointing ending to a good series. I really enjoyed the first two books. However, I found myself being bored with the third book and basically forcing myself to get through it."
5,Pullman's Third His Dark Materials Volume: Stunning!,"Philip Pullman has created an everlasting, exciting, and superb closer for the HIS DARK MATERIALS TRILOGY. It is just as un-put-downable as THE GOLDEN COMPASS and THE SUBTLE KNIFE. The end is not one of those ""and they lived happily ever after"" endings, it is actually quite the opposite. But I won't say any more on that. His great characterization(Pullman's), abundant suspense, and great plots are extended to THE AMBER SPYGLASS. One thing that confused me though, was this: The book had very little to do with the amber spyglass. I wonder why it was named that? Other Books I Suggest: MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS THE GIVER A WRINKLE IN TIME (I am only eleven, mind you, so you may not enjoy these)."
5,Amazing book,"I started the trilogy with misgivings: the friend who recommended it said that it was ""better than narnia"", something i was very reluctant to believe. The first two books, however wonderful and breathtaking and exciting they were, failed to live up to the 'greater-than-narnia' fame. After finishing the Amber Spyglass, however, i have become a convert. This book really IS better than narnia! I don't want to give away too much of the plot, so i'll just say that i wasn't able to put this book down for more than 10 minutes. I sat up long into the night trying to finish it and, at the same time, dreading the time when there will be no more book to read. That last page, for me, was something to long for and to dread at the same time. I've heard the Amber Spyglass descibed as 'too dark, lacking a happy ending.' While i am one of the countless who wishes for happy endings (i spent the last few chapters of the book bawling), the book was the better for it-the emotion was breathtaking."
5,A really strange but good ending,"Phillip Pullman has done it again and has created a masterpiece but even masterpieces have flaws. Lyra and will venture into the deep unknown dead to search for Roger and Will's father. I think Pullman should write a fourth book explaining the end of it all. I am really shocked as to what happened to Pantalimon and Kirjiva. And I also don't know who the female angel is, her name is too hard to spell. She is good thought to have been with the two daemons. The Golden Compass was the better of the three because it wasn't as rushed as The Amber Spyglass but because it was so good, five and a half stars should be deserved for the Amber Spyglass. I really enjoyed reading the triology though i wish that Phillip Pullman would explain the future of Lyra and the Republic of Heaven because I'm always dreaming of what happens to Lyra and Will."
2,Wha?,"Mrs. Coulter was such a wonderful character in the first two books, because as a reader you truly hate her, and can't wait to find out what happens to her. Then in the third book she has a personality shift ... is it real? Another lie? And then Pullman doesn't let us see her demise, we merely hear about it second-hand, as if it were of little importance. Wha' happened?"
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I first ordered this book I wasnt sure what it would be like because none of the people I knew had ever read it.I bought it because of all the reviews I read. It seem to good to be true, so I ordered it and I could not belive how good it was. If you liked Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings you are going to loooove this series!!!!!!! belive me."
5,Close to perfect!,"Well, this book is almost perfect. I personally think that there should be another book, after all Pullman is still alive. Why didn't he continue? I mean, I'd love to know what happens to the daemons and about if they actually meet again and about this Republic of Heaven. I'd also like to know if Will and Lyra grow up and meet each other again, not knowing who is who and then reveal their past figuring out that this is Will and Lyra! I wonder if they will marry...This book was a little confusing, I hated the Mulefa part, too boring. The saddest part was when Lyra had to split up with her daemon, I almost cried my heart out. Note: I'm not the real Lyra!! I just love this series so much, I had to use the name Lyra Silvertongue! Oh, yeah, and I think the second book was a lot better. My main question is, ""Why couldn't Pullman continue, like J.K. Rowling did?!?!"""
5,Please read my humble TRUTH about the Amber Spyglass,"I absolutely loved this book.It was a relief after waiting ayear after the Subtle Knife knowing the wee bit of knowledge you getat the end. .... Knowing this about Lyra keeps you thinking forever. ....The meaning, I think was supposed to be that God is unknown and shall always be unknown. Whether there is life after death or not we don't know and won't know until we get there. ....I loved the book, I loved the whole series, and I hope these reviews have not made you not want to read the book, but has intrigued you even more.Happy Reading."
2,Glad I'm not the only one who was completly lost with the final book.,"I can't believe the ending of what was truly a great series of books. I'm totally blown away with how this series ends.... What the **** happened???? What happened to the revolution? What happened to everybody who had flocked to Lord Asriel's banner? What was the decision that Lyra was supposed to make? What happened, what happened???? I could go on all night, I'm glad I wasn't the only one left in a lurch. Philip Pullman, you should be ashamed to ruin what should have been a been a historic series in line with LOR."
3,Conclusive,"Significant questions seem to be dutifully answered in this last book of the series. It carries on Will's and Lyra's journey in ""The Subtle Knife"" with a beginning of scores of happenings from different angles that may cause a mild confusion. The numerous types of life forms are sometimes exhausting to comprehend. Yet, Mr. Pullman, being a good story teller, successfully enchants his readers with a highly imaginative turbulence in the middle chapters that prolongs to a safe conclusion. Will's and Lyra's adventures have progressed into a more mind-boggling quest. With each experience they become more courageous. I regard ""The Golden Compass"" as the best of the three books. Coincidence or not I suspect a trace of Tolkien's influence in the heart of the story. And, the ending admirably opens up possibilities of sequels, if need be."
3,What a disappointment!,"I love the first two books in this series and read them both twice before beginning the last volume. I won't be reading it again. It took me forever to finish it. What happened? There is no thru-line and some scenes drag on forever. The scene with Jorek mending the knife seemed to take days. Too much filler, not enough action. Some of it was wonderful (the gay(?) angels), some seemingly thrown away (the disappearance of the being in the crystal coffin) and much more implausibility overall than the first two books. But the worst was the stiff upper lip British ending. I guess Pullman's aim was to write ""Brief Encounter"" for the kiddie set. I'm glad to put this one down."
3,It's okay,"After the huge climax of the story (it lasted 3 books, each of which weren't stand alone) I expected a more action packed ending (there being a war and all). This book is, at most on the same level as the other books."
4,The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials) book 3,"The Amber Spyglass is the final book of the trilogy wrtiten by Philip Pullman. I experienced the first book, ""The Golden Compass"" as a video viewing. Compelling was it that I chose the complete the trilogy thru audio book. Each chapter of book 3 is preface with poetry that reveals the writers knowledge of biblical truths and vastly diversed types of writings. This third book spiraled too far out in it's imagination of the battle between GOOD and evil. Tying all the loose ends together at the end was disappointing, however, he managed to bring a few eyebrow raising suprises. I wish he would eliminated some details of little significance and had put more emphasis and detailing in the parting of the two main characters that ended the story. Depending of ones personal beliefs, readers are left having to decide for themself which side won this battle."
3,"Good Books, Bad Ending(spoiler alert)","I read all the three books and they were amazing, all about a prophecy, a temptation (which was the story line for the whole series). I get to the end of this book and there is NO temptation at ALL!! Lyra (the hero) and Will (her friend) get whisked to safety, out of battle (they're the heros/main characters they should fight!). and almost when the book/battle is over Lyra and Will find themselves in love for no good reason, just to have to part from each other forever. So, then they make a big deal out of leaving each other (if they didn't find themselves in love it wouldn't matter!!!)Anyway, that's what I think.and, if you spent your time reading this, Thank You."
1,A disturbing book.,"It's a disturbing series of books, very well written but more is the pity. In Macbeth, the witches chant, ""Fair is foul"". Bill Pullman writes toward the same dark purpose."
1,Oh please,"Disgusting. Just disgusting. This book is a big, BIG let-down, but not because it was poorly written. No no no, this book could have been great...if it haddn't been full of [stuff]. The author obviously doesn't know a thing about the Catholic church, because this book is chock full o' errors. This book is a huge insult to my religion, and it makes me sick. The first two in this series were good, but suddenly something went wrong. I am not in the habit of doing this, but I burned this book, because this sort of filth should be destroyed."
5,"The Amber Spyglass, ...","The Amber Spyglass is the third and final book in Philip Pullman’s awesome trilogy, His Dark Materials. The book is slightly boring in one or two places, but the rest of the book makes up for it. The story is about Lyra and Will, two heroes from different worlds working together to save all the worlds. Will they make it in time? Read the book, or better yet the entire trilogy, to find out. The end of the book is sad, and just a little depressing, but very few books are as good as The Amber Spyglass!"
1,Sincerely awful compared to first book,"Unfortunately, as in the way of many series of books, the first was transcendent, unique, and beautiful. The second explored the universe more, but lacked the true gorgeousness of the first. The third is just odd and dull with a lot of meaningless detail and inexplicably bad dialogue. If you liked the first - stop there. I wish I had."
2,Disappointing and uneven,"I enjoyed the first two books, well written, fun and wonderful stories. However, it's clear Mr. Pullman could not decide if he wanted to write a treatise on the Catholic Church or if he wanted to write a great fantasy. It seems he tried to do both, and failed. If one was to spend so many pages creating a power point about how evil and weak 'god' was, at least do it well. Unfortunately, in the end neither the story nor his atheist rant were left unscathed. Too bad, such a great start."
5,So sad ...,"...that some readers with shuttered minds would call this work of fiction a ""lure into satanism"".I am an adult, and thought this series was delightful, marvelously written and wonderful interpretation of ""Paradise Lost"". (Milton was not exactly luring people into ""satanism"" in the 17th century.)If you are feel drawn to ""satanism"" by this book, then perhaps you need to take a close look at your own faith. I once read a book called Galatians, which talked about the fruit of the spirit being love. Hmmm. Who draws a more brighter picture of love--Philip Pullman and his depiction of love between a person and their daemon/soul or the reviewer and their excoriation of this book series?"
2,Total letdown after first two books,"I really enjoyed the first two books of this series; they had strong central characters combined with interesting stories.In trying to tie together the overall story, however, the author failed abysmally and created a disjointed, pointless jumble of words.Avoid."
3,"The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials, No 3","The three books are well written, exciting, keeping you on the edge of your seat. I read them and enjoyed them. However, if you are a Christian, in my opinion, it is a church bashing book. I was disturbed with the concepts of God is dead, and the church is evil,and we were lied to. I felt that Mr. Pullman did not have to get into his philosphy to such an extent to make the book a success. In my opinion,if you have young Christian minds, I would not let them read this."
1,Off track,"How ironic that Phillip Pullman, who has complained about the awful preachiness of Lewis' Narnia series, has himself written the final book of his trlogy as a hateful tract against Christianity and Catholicism. What a shame that he allowed the bitterness and anger of his ego to overshadow what could have been one of the most brilliant stories ever written. James Joyce, through the character of Stephen Dedalus in Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, spoke of art as being either pornographic (eliciting desire or fear), didactic (teaching a lesson) or fine (creating aesthetic arrest). Sad to say, The Amber Spyglass is nothing but pornographic didacticism. Those looking for confimation of their nihilistic and narcissistic approach to life will find much to revel in, but those who have experienced the ineffable joy of God's love will find nothing here except an ego in spiritual arrest."
3,Rushing to conclusions,"I really loved ""The Golden Compass"" and I thought ""The Subtle Knife"" was great, too: intellectually intriguing, engrossing, and well-crafted. I hate to be a nay-sayer, but I really thought the story fell flat in this final installment. Pullman is amazingly ambitious in this trilogy--so ambitious that he has simply has gotten in over his head by Vol. 3. To effectively pull all the various threads together that he has started working with in Vols. 1 and 2, he would need about three more books--not one--in my opinion. I thought this third book felt rushed throughout. Its pace was totally different than the other two books. I also thought the ""love story"" part came out of left field and was a little weird and off-putting. (I'm sure others will disagree with me on that.)All that said, I still think this series as a whole is well-worth reading, and would give it four stars overall."
5,i dont understand,This book and the whole series was excellent. What i dont understand is how everyone is compareing philip pullman with j.k rowling and harry potter. 'his dark materials' series is soooo much better than harry potter will ever be. dont get me wrong i like harry potter but it does get a tad redundant. 'his dark materials' is much darker and more complicated and more diverse. it just really got under my skin that on the cover of this book is a comment from a critic compareing to harry potter. the amber spyglass was very sad and was only the second book to bring me to tears.
5,Very amazing... A must read!,"I just finished this book yesterday, and I bought it for my Kindle. I absolutely love it. Yes the ending is sad with Will and Lyra. But you know what's got to happen and they prove what they are capable of. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the first two. I still have to read the prequel and I want to read the two after this about Lyra's life when she is growing up and some of her adventures with Pan afterward. I am awed by this series. It has done so much for me. And now I wish I could go to other worlds. ;) A must buy for real!"
4,Quite an end to a fabulous trilogy,"In some ways I didn't like this as much as the first two books in the trilogy, but there were many surprises and it certainly held my interest. All three books were hard to put down. I highly recommend them."
5,And Excellent End to an Excellent Trilogy,"I don't read series that often. I get bored with the same old characters and the sometimes amazing twists and turns the author takes to keep the story going for another book or two. His Dark Materials blew my mind, frankly. The first book was wonderful and they actually kept getting better. I seriously can't recommend these books enough. They're imaginative and I adore all the characters...I'm pretty sure that there's a deep philosophical truth underneath it all if only I could spare the time to ponder it. Five out of five stars for the whole series. Buy this one for your family and friends."
1,"Boring, Horrible, and Disappointing","When I read this book, I had high expectations. The first two in the trilogy were well-written and intresting. However, this one is weighted down by so much propaganda and what seems hate for Christianity, Spyglass doesn't get off the ground.I had a hard time getting through the chapters and it seemed that Pullman had lost his talent. Also, since this is in the libarary's children's section, I wasn't expecting something like gay angels. I know that people aren't quite so innocent today as they were a long time ago, but come on, it's rather gross. Pullman also paints Christians and God as evil and twists around the story of genesis.But even if I were to pass over all the controversy, I'd still say that it seemed as tedious as Moby Dick. And that's quite hard."
5,Incredible!,"This is the third book in the His Dark Materials trilogy, and it's probably the best book I've ever read. The writing style is terrific, and when I finished, I had to pull myself out of Lyra and Will's universe. I've read this book probably 20 times, and I love it every time. When I got it, I stayed up all night to read it. You have to read this book!"
4,A Little Too Preachy At the End,"Philip Pullman is a true master of words. He commands them like flowing water and can tell a wonderfully beautiful story as he did with The Amber Spyglass. He resolves things quite nicely but he did it in way that seemed a bit manipulative to me. Philip Pullman has his views and I think he's just trying a little too hard to make me believe what he does. Otherwise, I commend Philip Pullman on a job well done on ending a rather difficult series. I just hope that in the future he puts art before anything else as he had told himself to do in interviews. That's all."
2,A painful third installement,"Much as I enjoyed the first 2 of His dark material, I found the third one overly long, overly complex with parts too similar, in my view, to ""Out of the silent planet"". I totally lost interest in Mary Malone's doings and there were just too many parallel stories and plots, I became impatient with it all. Lyra's motivation to find Roger simply doesn't stand up in the face of what she has to go through (because she DREAMED about him?) and it becomes implausible and unbelievable. Overall disappointing and too ambitious.I'm surprised at the outcry by the Christian readers though. What about freedom of speech?? Isn't someone ALLOWED to write against Christianity? You don't have to agree but please let writers write what they will. I don't believe Pullman's books will corrupt anybody!"
2,Underwhelming,"I read the other somewhat negative reviews and I feel I must agree. It seems like the third book was written by someone else. The first two were compelling reads, but this one is a mishmash of disjointed plotlines. Read it only to complete the series. Also, to me it is not a series for young adults. I am a fan of the fantasy genre, and it reads like an adult adventure, albeit with a child as a protagonist.It will be interesting to see if the upcoming movie of the Golden Compass starring Nicole Kidman will fully address the author's religious views."
3,Gets tangled in its own feet.,"I loved the first two books in the trilogy. I was expecting to love this one. I did not. What happened?Mostly what happened is that Pullman shifted from a strong character focus to a book that is nearly entirely convoluted and complicated plot. So many elements are pulled in that he seemingly does not have time for the wonderful character work from the other books. Only Lyra and Will continue to be developed, but sadly that development is not enough to sustain the plot.I enjoyed this book, and I enjoyed its message about not accepting authority at face value. It was just disappointing given how strongly the first two books affected me."
2,dissapointing,perhaps there was too much expectation after the first two great books but my feeling is that there were too many loose ends that weren't tied up.The very complex issue of religion was always going to be hard and I feel it was handled badly. For the impressionable young readership I think it is damaging. i was ill at ease throughout the book with where this subject was going.Loose ends? After all the fuss over daemons Lyra and Will gave up there daemons rather too easily. Mrs sudden and complete change of character. Loved her in the first two and annoyed that I was indifferent to her in the last. Will touching Lyras daemon? Never happened in history just seemed a bit lame.It really seemed to me like the author had written the book and then gone back through formulaically and inserted intriguing snippets that he could then close off towards the end.
2,This book drowns in Pullman's notions about religion,"Throughout the Dark Materials trilogy you can see Pullman gradually moving away from great character development and plot, to a virtual manifesto for Atheism. This in itself can't be faulted too much, except these books are generally ""marketed"" toward a young audience, however the books characters, events and overall story are sacrificed on the altar of his personal anti-religious agenda.As others have stated, there are many plot devices and character traits that are simply abandoned: one wonders why they were in the book in the first place (one example: the species the mulafa are warring with).If you are a ""free-thinking"" new-age left-winger, this book is perfect for you. If you are a typical, mainstream, religion-respecting person who enjoys good storytelling, you can do better elsewhwere, and I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 15."
2,Diminishing returns,"I read the HDM Trilogy in one go and enjoyed it. Sadly however, the quality and inventiveness decreases from book to book, whilst the preachiness increases. I found much of the material in The Amber Spyglass to be boring, contrived or unconvincing. For example, the Mulefa are rather silly and trite. They don't really add much to the story and Mary is a little pointless as a charcter, despite supposedly have a big role to play. The visit to the land of the dead is overlong and the relationship between Lyra and Will just doesn't seem real. These are 12-13 year olds after all. In the end, Pullman is a good storyteller, bu no Milton."
3,Caution: This book may not be what you expect,"I have nothing but praise for Philip Pullman's style and skill as a storyteller. However, I feel a warning is in order, in view of the fact that the book has been classed as juvenile fiction. I believe that there are some potential buyers of this book who would want to know that--despite the vital role played by angels in the story line--""The Amber Spyglass"" reveals that the universe Mr. Pullman has created in this trilogy is most definitely *not* the kind of universe envisioned by other noted fantasy authors to whom his work has been compared (Madeleine L'Engle, JRR Tolkein and CS Lewis, to name three). To say more would reveal too much of the plot. However, I strongly recommend that parents of young people who are reading this book also read it themselves and then discuss it--and the feelings that its premise may evoke--with their children. I would not give this book to anyone under the age of 14."
2,"Some fine moments, but overdone and tendentious","Each of the books in this series is weaker than its predecessor. ""Spyglass"" contains some deeply affecting sections -- notably the underworld journey and the tragic conclusion. However, the bulk of this volume is marred by too many cutesy creatures (the 'angels' and the eco-utopic mulefa, especially) who lack the complexity of the armored bears and, at least as originally presented, the witches. In this respect, the book resembles ""Return of the Jedi."" Finally, I found the gratuitous chapter (it added nothing to the plot) caricaturing the Russian Orthodox priest deeply offensive. ...."
2,Boringer.,"Now I know Pullman had no idea what he was doing when he started this trilogy. This book runs on fumes, and it's made even worse when the author introduces ideas only to discard them lazily. Like the guy who goes after our main characters. Father Gomez, I think his name is. The book keeps returning to him like he's important to the story, but he winds up not being important at all.And then there's Iorek Byrnison, the bear. He shows up for a while, then disappears. I mean, come on. And don't get me started on the ending. I just don't get the significance of the angels and the ghosts and the daemons and the witches and the mulefa. They're all here, but they don't gel in this mess of a book.Oh, yeah, and I still didn't give a crap about the characters. It's hard to relate to them when they talk like old people. Show me a kid who talks like Lyra and Will and I'll show you a monkey who craps gold."
2,A let down for a trilogy that started with promise,"Philip Pullman completes his ""Dark Materials"" series, and, sadly, there are few surprises. This last book ends as a preachy muddle, and most of the promised climaxes turn out to be anti-climaxes (the foreshadowed betrayal, the end of the Authority, etc.) As radical as Pullman fancies himself, this work also seems to keep trying to reconcile its anti-Christian impulses with Christian morality (dying to self for others, the value of truth, the gifts of the body and physicality). Pullman fashions a straw man of Christianity that actually much more resembles various Christian heresies such as Manichaeism or gnosticism, all the while espousing some of their tenets. For someone who has vocally criticised C. S. Lewis for a tendency to sermonize, Pullman surprising falls to the same temptation, blunting his craftsmanship in this final book of the trilogy."
4,One Small Problem...,The Amber Sypglass was one of the best books I have ever read. It was moving and gripping *EXCEPT FOR THE ENDING!*That was the biggest problem. The ending was stupid and sappy and totally unlike the rest of the book. That's why I took off a star.
5,Paradise Lost indeed.,"I've enjoyed this series immensely. When I first read ""The Golden Compass"" I was struck by the fact that this was a story told unlike many I had read before. ""The Subtle Knife"" continued this. This is a remaking of Paradise Lost and it is wonderful. I enjoyed the fact that our heroes do not get everything they want in the end. I felt the pain that was there, the loss. This story was ended perfectly.There were some parts that could have been fixed better. While I enjoyed the whole sequence with Mary Malone and the muelfa, what point did it really serve? Also, Mrs. Coulter, the villianess from the previous few books, am I to believe such a change of heart. There was nothing to gain from her actions here. No advantage except what she was doing for love. A change that was a bit disappointing.But I digress. Buy this book. Read it to your children. Answer their questions. Read it for yourself. This is storytelling at its finest."
1,Very Shabby. I was disappointed.,"This book left me very disappointed. It dragged on and on. Phillip Pullman had so much potential, but he threw it all down the drain. Personally, I feel that Will ruined the story. Lyra was a solid enough character, and many of my friends, both boys and girls, thought that Pantalaimon was enough of a male influence to suffice. I was particularily disappointed when they abandoned Pantalaimon. He was my favorite character, and I was ready to stop reading once he was gone. Also, it was very rude of Will to just jump on Lyra and start kissing her. Now that was disgusting."
1,Lame ending for a great beginning,"The first two books were well-drawn out, character-focused and exciting. This book was none of those things. It was a confusing mess with an anti-climactic ending. In terms of reading this as an adventure story, the main bad guy gets destroyed really easily and really fast. And the tempation we're all waiting with bated breath to see Lyra face ends up being not really a temptation at all, just a quickly thrown together ending to finish the trilogy. Sorry Philip Pullman, looks like you couldn't wait to get the check for this one!"
2,Disappointed,"This book left me unsatisfied. First of all, it doesn't seem finished and the ending came somewhere out of left field. I had to push myself to read it because it was so slow in some spots. The land of the dead? Come on - did Philip Pullman just pull this stuff out of a hat? It just doesn't make any sense to me. Besides that, the theme went from adventureous to being a love story. There's no way I'd have a 10 year old read The Amber Spyglass - as I would for the first two books. At this point, I'm glad I read the book because now I know what happened - whether or not I like it. If there's a fourth book, there's no way I'm reading it."
4,the subtile knife,"Book two gives us the second chapter of this storyline. These books of course, have much more for the reader than the viewer of the movies will probably will ever give. Dark fantasy that even a adult can enjoy, in the same vein as say Harry Potter. Enjoy!"
1,A Dissappointing Wait,"I read the whole ""His Dark Materials"" series, and it would have been better if I had not read the third one. This book, although it includes some exciting parts, has nothing to do with the plots of the other two books. In second book it says that Lyra will be tempted by Dr. Mary Malone. In the last book, which I excitedly awaited only to my dissappointment, there was absolutely nothing about this. I think Phillip Pullman, of whom I am a huge fan, should rewrite this story that doesn't stick to the plot of the other two books. I suggest to all readers who have or will read the first two books that they use their imaginations for the third book. This book was as if the author scribbled in down in an hour. Nothing fit! It litterally ruined the whole series. Don't even bother waisting the time or the money on this book."
1,atheistic fantasy,"Pullman is a skilled novelist, but from the beginning a reader should know that this book is blatantly atheistic. In and of itself that is not wrong. Pullman may write about whatever he chooses. But I have a hard time that this was marketed as juvenile fantasy and nowhere on the cover did it mention they would kill God, who was never really God anyway but just one of the older angels. The ""tempter"" (his word) Mary guides the children Lyra and Will into intimacy when she tells them her own stories of sexual discovery. Their intimacy changes the world since they are the new Adam and Eve. Mary then flatly announces that Christianity is a big mistake that went on too long. Had the cover been honest about what the series was really about from the beginning, I would not have read it."
1,just awful,"I thought the golden compass was decent, the subtle knife was somewhat decent. This book was terrible. None of the characters are written well. The story is choppy. The dialogue is idiotic.Given all the awards this series won, I was surprised at what low-rank literature it turned out to be."
4,pretty good,I absolutley loved this book until I got to the end. That pissed me off! You should read the book to find out why though.
1,WORST WAX I'VE EVER TRIED!!!!!!!,"I bought this product only because it was the last one, out of other brands I prefer, that was on the shelf. Went home, heated it up.... its very gooey and drippy, and applied it. Not only was it EXTREMELY EXTREMELY STICKY, (good for legs, bad for hands) but the wax starts hardening in about 2 minutes.... i had to keep microwaving it that i got soo sick of it and just threw it away!! it gets everywhere!!! i scrubbed and scrubbed in the shower to get parts off and even shaved the parts i didnt get and the wax was still there!!! i scrubbed soo much my skin was raw! even the parts that i did wax had some hair here and there that the wax missed. THE BOX MAKES IT SOUND SO FANCY AND THAT IT SMELLS GOOD AND BLAH BLAH BLAH...... BUT DONT BE FOOLED!!!! NEVER WILL I BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN NOR WILL I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!! save your money and buy something else.... its $9.00 for a reason! Its horrible!!!!"
2,its alright,"the lavender smells nice. but be VERY careful not to over heat this.i accidently overheated it (i'm used to a different kind of wax that takes longer to heat up) and spilled it all over. it got hot boiling wax on my arm and all over the microwave and stove and the floor.i wouldn't of boughten this if they didn't have the other kind of bikini wax i wanted.i tried it on my legs, and it kinda works. i never have much luck with waxing my legs.the kit is pretty good. sally hansen is a good brand to buy.i hope you have better luck than i did with it. and be careful heating it up."
1,NIGHTMARE.,"The single WORST product i have ever used in my entire life.i heated it, applied it to my legs and it wouldnt come off, the strip would only pick up half the wax and the rest remained stuck to my skin. and nothing would make it budge, not the purple oil, not baby oil, not body lotion, nothing. half a bottle of pharmacy alcohol and an hour of rubbing left a residue which took a week to disappear. and the cherry on top of the cake was the massive ugly unsightly bruise it left behind....not to mention the fact that it picked up 3 strands of hair and left the rest.i threw it straight into the garbage which is where it belongs.DONT WASTE UR MONEY. its awful. the person who invented this thing should be full body waxed with this product. that might teach him/her not to foist disgusting stuff on the unsuspecting public."
2,Not water soluable,"Product will remove hair but only comes with a tiny bottle to remove the wax from anywhere it remains. Even then, I always find I miss a place. So when I remove my pants for bed, I'll find black fuzzy splotches all over my leg where the pants material has stuck to the remaining wax.Sally Hansen's wax products have really declined. They discontinued their two best wax hair removal kits: sugar wax and express wax hair removal (white chocolate scented). Those wax kits were efficient and easy to remove. Now you can only seem to buy the ""eco friendly"" one where the wax does not stick to the plastic and this lavender one where the wax does not wash off."
1,MISERABLE!,"This is the worst wax I have ever used. Not only does it not come off, but it tore my legs apart. It left my legs bruised from scrubbing the wax off with both the oil provided and soap and water."
1,what is with this non-removable product!?!?!,"Admittedly, waxing your own legs is a messy process, but even with usual precautions, this wax GETS EVERYWHERE AND DOES NOT COME UP.WEEKS LATER I've carried specks of it to the couch {from unknown bits on the floor?} and I've NO idea how to get it up. The bottle of ""remover"" is an unknown substance that was not much bigger than a perfume sample and nowhere near enough to clean up my own legs, much less the rest.Stay away, whatever the chemistry of these Sally Hansen waxes is/are, THEY DON'T GO AWAY.I'm afraid to put the towel I used in the wash for fear of finding those little bits on future loads of laundry."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY!! This product is the WORST! It is very difficult to manage and good luck getting off of ANYTHING it touches, including your skin. It is so far from water soluble it is not even funny. Doesnt wash off of skin, remains sticky, I couldnt even get it out of the sink when I dripped a little. SO much work, a nightmare to clean up, and frustrating to use. Accidentally dripped some on my arm, and we had to SHAVE it out because it is like some horrible super sticky cement. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!"
1,PLEASE DONT USE THIS,This is a really BAD wax. I have been waxing for more than ten years now and have never experienced what I did with this wax. My underarms were sore for almost three days.Dont believe the review of the 4/5 stars.JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!
1,Awful product,"I have been waxing my underarms and bikini area for years now and never have I had this much trouble with any wax I used. The product is EXTREMELY sticky and you cannot wash it off with soap or water. They provide an oil to take it off the skin but the quantity is not enough and it doesnt work on other surfaces like countertops. Not to mention it doesnt pull all the hair off and it tore my skin instead. Beware, this wax is extremely painful, useless and messy. This is coming from someone who has waxed for years and never complained about pain."
5,Thank you,"Couldn't buy this product locally, so sourced it online. Very impressed with the prompt delivery and service.Many thanks"
1,stop the madness!,"bought this for my 12yr old daughter. this was one of the most traumatic experiences that either of us have had. followed directions. trying to apply it was a joke! sticky gunk every where! when removing from area intended to wax, removed chunks of skin! Thank God tried on small area first! you may think result occured because she is 12. she has been waxing (by professional) since she was 10. this was a scene from a bloody horror movie. would not recomend this for anyone!!! For those concerned, my daughter has a condition that caused her to grow very thick pubic hair when she was 3. She cannot shave this area do to EXTREME ingrown hairs and irritation. Her medical specialist suggested we try waxing. I did alot of research and asked alot of questions. What i did not research was this cheap product. Very dumb i know."
2,Cleanup of this product is a nightmare,"I have been using the Sally Hansen sugar hair removal product for years with good results (almost as good as the much more expensive NADS). I thought I would try the wax and found it to be VERY effective for removing hair but almost impossible to cleanup. It stuck to everything it touched (sink, counter) and I couldn't find anything to remove it. When I put the cloth strips I used and the wash cloths in the washer, the wax got all over the washer and on every other piece of clothing in there. I called the company to try to find some help and they had no clue and did not seem to care. I don't remember any warning that this was a problem on the instructions. I felt it was my civic duty to warn others. Hope this helps"
1,Messy and Ineffective,"I'm new to waxing and bought this for my legs and bikini area. Regardless of how thick or thin I spread on the wax, it did a poor job and the paper strips did not remove all the wax from my skin. It was not as painful as I expected for a wax product, but left behind a sticky purple residue that would not come off with the oil included in the kit or soap and water. I followed the directions carefully and was left with a huge mess and little hair removal."
1,Big Mess and Non-effective product!!,"I have been using home-waxing kits for a few years now. I've tried a few products and settled with Nair sugar-based wax - it's effective and really easy to clean. It has become impossible to find it in the stores, so I tried the Sally Hansen version instead. Never again. I got purple wax all over the place, and it's really difficult to clean up. Plus, my hair grew back in oh say a week or so. I have never had this problem with any other wax products. Plus, it was really hard to spread on my skin and I ran out of strips. I will never buy this product again."
1,Very Disappointed,"Before purchasing this product I read the reviews, although the reviews weren't favorable. I decided to give it a chance and it was a big mistake. The wax is way to sticky, the strip removed two strands of hair and the wax was very difficult to remove. Although Sally Hansen has many good products in the market this one is a waste of time and money."
5,Works well on sensitive skin,"I love it!! Even though it's very sticky, i prefer it over bare natural. just make sure you use the blue oil to remove the wax, nothing else will remove it."
4,very good product,"I really like this kit. I only use for eyebrow waxing.PROS: 1. Product has really lasted a long time. I wax every 2 weeks, and have only used about 1/3 of the jar over a 6 month period.2. The lavender smell is great also!****CONS: I wish there were different sized sticks to apply the product. The ones included are large, wide, and almost impossible to use to spread wax on your eyebrow area.2. not enough paper strips. but a great tip I learned : USE COFFEE FILTERS from the dollar store :)"
1,DO NOT buy this product!!!,"I bought this waxing system because I liked that it used cloth strips, and came with a pretty good sized jar of wax. But after using it, it's clear why the product only costs $9. It is the WORST thing I have ever used!! It took a full 3 minutes for the wax to heat up to a usable consistency, instead of the recommended 30 seconds. Even after it's heated up, the wax is so STICKY it's impossible to use without getting it all over everything. The only thing that will take off excess wax is the azulene oil that is included in the kit, and they only provide you with a very small bottle of it. I applied the wax exactly how the directions stated, and it still didn't even remove all the hair. It didn't even remove half of it. Then I was left with sticky bits of wax stuck to my skin that are nearly impossible to remove. I would highly discourage anyone who wants to buy this product, it's such a hassle and the results aren't worth the effort."
4,"Very Effective Wax, but also VERY messy!","This wax is great to use for your whole body. It has a great smell, BUT it is not water soluble! Be careful not to get ANY of the wax on your fingers and use gloves. First time using it, it got in my hair, on my hands, and it was just a complete mess! Other than the mess, the wax itself is really good. It gets every hair, and has a pleasant smell to it and it hurts less than any other wax. It's a good wax, but just wear gloves & be careful with it or it will be a complete messy disaster!"
1,Worst wax ever,"Sally Hansen makes some good products, but this is not one of them. The wax is super-sticky, and impossible to remove neatly. It left my skin super-irritated and red for days. Avoid at all costs!"
2,So - So,"This item is less painful than other products I've used. I think because the wax really does grip the hair and not the skin. The problem is it is VERY VERY VERY STICKY. Wow. What a huge sticky mess this caused in my bathroom. I've never had such a poor experience trying to clean up after waxing. I would reccomend the Nair brazilian formula wax over this that comes in the roll on, that rinses off easily."
2,Not strong enought,"I wanted to try this variety of the sally Hansen wax this time. Sadly, I had a lot of problems with it, and I was only using it on my armpits and still couldn't get it to work. It's a shame really; I recommend the regular Sally Hansen wax instead. That one works better."
1,Terrible,"This wax was awful. The wax residue was so difficult to get off; they provide an extra bottle of some strange smelling liquid to help remove the wax afterwards, but it doesn't work well at all and I had sticky patches left all over my legs that I really had to rub at to get off. Good thing it was only my legs; supposedly this thing works for bikini, too - that would hurt. Don't buy this. There are much better wax kits (like Nair) that are so much easier and less painful to remove with just some water."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS GARBAGE,"I bought this product because I was tired of shaving not having long enough effects. This product doesn't even remove hair. I attempted to use it on my legs and after following every instruction to the letter all it did was make my skin red and stinging. Also, the mess is insane. It took several minutes of scrubbing to even get wax off my hands and I still haven't been able to get it off the area I attempted to wax."
5,Riveting,This is an incredible accounting of the atrocities of WWII. I was unable to put the book down. It is extremely well written.
5,"Survivor Skills Then, Courage Now","It must have taken the author a great deal of inner strength and pain to come to terms with these horrible happenings and be able to put them down on paper to share with all those that read this book. It was amazing that one so young would be quick enough to call on survival skills at the right moment. Though some, of course, was luck, this author displayed a natural instinct to survive throughout his nightmare."
5,my soul imprinted,"The 23rd Psalm is a story that has been imprinted upon my soul, that will remain there as long as I live. I share in the sentiments of Pat's review; I was both compelled to stay in its pages by day and visited with its images at night in my sleep, somehow sharing in this man's plight.Thank you Mr. Salton for allowing others, for allowing me, into the most private and intimate and horrific memories of your life. I esteem you, and those like you, with the utmost honor. May the Lord cause His face to shine upon you my friend."
5,MAS,"The only reason I put this book down was to reflect. This story is so important - I will do as another reviewer suggests - ""This book is to be read and passed down to our children to read.Very powerful.A suspensful read on a horrific truth."
1,Does not fit,I ordered this for my 2006 Jeep Commander and it does not fit. It is actually for a Ford Excersion.
3,Rob Lowe in an unexpected role. Seriously silly. Not one of my favorties!!!,"I have been watching a lot of Rob Lowe movies lately. The role he plays in this movie is not at all what I have come to expect from the character he plays. It was so silly, that I spent to whole time laughing because he acted so silly. All of the characters were a total hoot. He was not the only one that acted silly. They all did. If the director was trying to create a movie that was a laugh a minute, he truly succeeded on this one. I am collecting Rob Lowe movies, but this is not one I am planning to collect. Other people may enjoy it, just because it is so silly. It was just not my cup of tea. If you like to laugh a whole lot. This would be a good movie for you."
5,CD,Again product delivered on time and undamaged. Great price. I have this on tape cassette thought is was time to update to CD. Was sold out at alot of other places. Would recommend to others.
5,Where is the remaster?,I can't believe this has not been re-released in HDCD like Fresh Aire 1-8 were. What is the hold up? This one probably sold more than those other cds combined.
5,Great Chtistmas Music,This is one of our all time favorite Holiday CDs. It is nice to mix in with other favorites to change it up a bit and still get the feel of the season.
5,Excellent LP!,I ordered this from Amazon and got the LP still in the plastic from 1984! I've already played it several hundred times. It's one of the best Christmas albums ever. Even more fun to have the original LP.
5,Just love this!! Many thanks,Everything went really smoothly! Thanks I really appreciate doing business with people do a great job. Looking forward to more great amazon purchases. Just love getting new Christmas music especially the stuff that is tried and true
1,I paid for it but never got it,"I love the cd so I thought I would download it to my cell phone. That was Friday - the money came out of my bank account, but I never received the music. Very sad indeed"
3,Review for Mannheim Steamroller Christmas,"I really like Mannheim Steamroller's Chrismas music, so this one completed my collection of albums."
4,Great Traditional Christmas Music,"I have this CD on cassett when it first came out and wore out the cassett, I am so glad I found it on CD. it is wonderful and a must listen to on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day for our family. It's part of our tradition."
3,renaissance selections best,"I like this CD a lot, but the Good King Wenceslas recording is truly awful...and Deck the Halls has an '80s sound to it...I really enjoyed the ""Christmas Sweet"" and when the recordings are in this genre I think Manheim Steamroller is at its best."
4,Christmas -- CD,"The service of geting the CD was fast, to the extent that I can wait 2 days to get it. The price was right, saved some money, it was new, sealed and received in perfect condition at a time of year when governmentmail service can be damaging. --Roger W."
4,Beautiful.,"Christmas by Mannheim Steamroller is a gorgeous Christmas cd, this is my second favorite cd from this instrumental band. I enjoy listening to this album every December, you gotta hear it for yourself. I highly recommend it!"
4,Help Me Spock!,"The Savage Curtain is a worthy episode of Star Trek. Don't let Abraham Lincoln's absurd way of revealing himself turn you off from this episode. I wish Lincoln had been introduced in another way. Because of this, I took off a star. However, once Lincoln came aboard the Enterprise, the story unfolded itself in an excellent way.This episode is so pivotal because it introduced so many important characters. Kahless the Unforgettable and Surak both explained important parts of Klingon and Vulcan history respectively. Most people do not realize that Season Three provided a lot of information on the History of Vulcan (sadly destroyed in Star Trek XI). It was in Let That Be Your Last Battlefield that we learned Vulcan almost destroyed itself until logic was adopted."
5,Blending Esoteric and Exoteric Religious Thought!,"An excellent historic attempt to bring all the major religions and spiritual paths under one book cover. Most notable is this author's desire for the reader to understand the story behind the development of religious thought, which makes this book a little more interesting than others who just expound on the individual dogma and doctrine of each religion's path."
3,Learn the steps,This video is pretty good for learning the beginning line dance steps. It does not have as clear or crisp a picture as I would have liked. It could be livelier. But it is a good way to start.
5,THE BEST NFAA ALBUM,"This is the best No Fun At All album, more melodic, with great lyrics.If you are a new NFFA fan, buy ""Out of Bounds"" first, then you can buy this one. It's a shame the ending of NFAA."
3,Dissapointment,"This new release is a big let down compared to the great music they have recorded in the past, it seems they are following the typical trend in punk today, slower beats, no more double bass, happier sounding music that seems to have lost its edge."
2,Hooks should be longer...,"I bought a couple of these for 2 bathrooms. They look fine, however, I think the part of the hook that you hang things on needs to be longer. A pair if pajamas is fine, since the fabric is thinner, but if I try to hang a robe on it that is made of polar fleece, or a thick towel, it falls off onto the floor. I kept them because I didn't realize this until after they were installed and my robe kept falling to the floor. I would not recommend this hook; look for something else. This needs to be redesigned; either longer hooks or with more of an upward curve."
3,one issue remaining,"The projection clock is good, but I have two issues having nothing to do with Amazon1. I had thought I could project only the time, not the inside or outside temperature. Oregon should add that as an optionIs it 5:21 am or is the temperature outside 52.1 degrees?2.The outside temperature monitor needs to be placed in a protected area as a driving rain will penetrate the monitor."
2,Worst AA Yet,"I have to agree with several other reviewers who find that Acoustic Alchemy's best work is now well in the past. I have all their albums, but doubt I'll buy any more since the trend is clearly in the wrong direction. The more musical styles and new instruments and glitzy production they pile on, the less interesting the music has become. This CD has nothing memorable, not a single melody that sticks with you, not a single tune that makes you want to play it again. The early albums still sound fresh and exciting, but not this one."
3,Where has AA gone?,"As a longtime AA listener starting with ""Red Dust and Spanish Lace"", I always marveled at the melodic sounds that two acoustic guitars could produce. Unfortunately, that sound is lost in this CD. While I realize that musicians have to grow and experiment with new sounds, AA's historic sound has always been acoustic guitar. That's what always drew me to their music, I just don't hear it in this CD. There is too much electronic mixing and not enough ""pure guitar work"". I am not even sure I would call it a smooth jazz CD, not really sure how I would categorize it. I'm not saying the CD isn't good, it's just disappointing. Not what I expected or hoped for."
4,It's about the fun to help sick people,"An eye surgeons story - it's serious and humorous, cute, sexy and engaging. As a commercial artist, I feel like illustrating the book."
4,"An honest,endearing story of modern, rural medical practice.","This a charming story of a doctor in a nearly rural area, his pleasures, trials and travails with patients, current medical practices, and encroaching socialization of medicine. I live in an area very like that described in the book and could recognize many similar characters. They might be my neighbors.While sometimes a little polemical, the story and characters were engaging and usually entertaining. The relationship between the doctor and his wife is a celebration of marriage. If you, like me enjoy small-town life, characters, and the vagaries thereof, I'm sure you'll enjoy this book."
5,Ego Psychology and Social Work Practice,"purchasing through Amazon was breeze. Got product quickly. Purchased new. Product obviosly new and in perfect condition. Book itself is superb. All in all it's a 10 on a 0 to 5 scale, with 5 being best!"
1,Black and Decker sweeper,"I gave this to my Brother coz it was just to heavy for me to carry up and down steps,but it has great suction and carries a very long charge.ThanksBrenda"
3,"Good vac, meh battery.","These batteries are junk. They need to fully drain to really get a nice recharge. Sadly, I don't think anyone else has a better battery for this type of vacuum. So in that sense, its not a bad vac."
2,No power,I have owned this vacuum for over a year. I have used it very little because it has low suction power.
1,dustbuster is busted,"I have always kept a dustbuster in my kitchen for quick clean ups. They are always charged. Not with this new 18 volt model. Not only does is not have much suction power, you can't keep the battery plugged in so it is always charged and ready to go. If you don't use it for 4-5 days, the charge depletes! So then you have to recharge it for 14-16 hours. Not convenient at all. So I returned the dustbuster. I then ordered a Eureka that works great and can be left plugged in, permanently. The model number is H96. It is not as large as it looks in the photos and is a great buy; not to mention it costs less than the inefficient new dustbusters. The new dustbuster models are now just cheap knock offs of the original great machines. Black and Decker in their attempt to make a higher profit by cheapening a previously great product, destroyed a really good thing.I strongly recommend the Eureka below:Eureka Quick Up Cordless 2 in 1, 96Hproduct."
4,"Great suction, Difficult to empty.","I ordered this item because of other reviews I had read from Amazon. Overall, I really like the way it works. I am a little disappointed that it is a bit difficult to empty the dust cup. You have to actually take things apart and remove the dust cup manually in order to get it ready for the next use. Other than that, I can recommend it. I like the removable, chargable, interchangeable battery. It is easy to manage."
2,Have to plug in to charge,Didnt like how you have to plug this in each time to charge. Was hoping it would self charge in a cradle. It is also quite heavy. Returned it and got a refund
2,"Not Enough Suction, Poor Design","I bought this about a week ago at the local WalMart. At first, it was fine, or ok. But after a week or so the filter was clogged and isn't very easy to clean, and it lost most of its suction power. The filter has little plastic holes that get clogged, and then the air flow goes to pot. After cleaning it, I am still not getting the amount of suction I need, so I am taking it back. The only good thing I have to say about this unit is the power supply is compatible with any 18V battery that goes on other black and decker appliances. While I would not repurchase this item, I do have other appliances that use the same battery and I am happy with them. I think they need to redesign it for better suction, even with a dirty filter. I was only using it for sucking up messes in the car, for the carpeted surfaces. I think they can come up with something better than this that has more suction. Back to the drawing board on this one, Black and Decker!"
2,weak,Overpriced for it's weak suction. Not sure how this battery can power a string trimmer and saw so much better than this poor hand vac
4,great vac,"Works great, good power and lasts long. Sits idle long and works well then. Wish it had a crevice tool and a small brush attachment then I could use it on my laptop and electronics in living room. Great for quick clean ups of crumbs and other dry spills."
3,Disappointed,I was very happy when I received this vacuum but disappointed when I used it. It is built very well but does not have the pick up power that my old vacuum had. Does not do well cleaning up off of carpeting.
2,The opposite of sucks,"I bought this at the store today and used one of my fully charged 18 Volt Black and Decker batteries I already had. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because the battery is swappable with my other 18 Volt Black and Decker units. Unlike the weed-eater and other things, however, this lacks the power you would expect from an 18 volt power supply! I've had cheap crappy uprights with less power that actually had more suction. This manages to get a couple pieces of fluff, and some stray kitty litter, but only after several passes or creating a seal with the floor directly over the particles to be picked up. It'd be about as easy to just bend down and pick the offending particle up. This will be going back at the next opportunity. I expect a heck of a lot more power from a heavy hand-held that costs sixty bucks!"
1,"No longevity, ni-cad battery won't last.","I was looking for a powerful dustbuster and this vac filled my needs when I got it. The problem is the battery eventually will not hold a charge and it seems that every-time I go and get it to clean a small spill, the battery is almost dead and the power is dismal. Too expensive for what you get and should have been a lithium ion, not ni-cad. Really not a recommended buy."
3,"Loud, annoying long range","This radar detector is huge. It is very loud too. It has good range on radar detection. However, it doesn't matter what radar detector you have, if a cop points a laser at you are toast, because it is a laser, not radar, meaning that it will only detect the laser when it is being pointed directly at you. I bought this detector for my gadget lovin' fiancee. I have a whistler that is a couple years old that works just fine. It has saved me from a few tickets. I would probably buy my old one, over this one any day. Also, the packaging it came in, had been opened before and taped back shut. So, I am thinking someone thought the same thing and returned it!"
1,"Awful... truly, truly awful.","This book appears to have been written by someone with no understanding of the rudiments of modern science. Most of the primary scientific ideas introduced to move the plot along are preposterous.The author is incapable of consistent characterization. I've met Barbie dolls with deeper personalities. The story overflows with minutiae in an attempt to create a feasible world, but most are irrelevant, and none give rise to a McGuffin. His use of real-life political figures and television news broadcasters does nothing to give a sense of greater reality to the plot, merely seeming gratuitous.This book is subtitled, ""The Terrifying New Disaster Novel,"" which is correct on all counts, so it qualifies it for one star, simply for truth in advertising.The only editing that would have sufficed to improve this misguided attempt at literature would have been the judicious application of a can of lighter fluid."
2,SPONGEBOB RULES!!!,"Spongebob is once again fantastic! All of these episodes are sure to please, especially the Christmas episode! I have all of the spongebob dvd's and this one is even better then the last one that came out! A must have for spongebob fans!"
5,"""...And everybody pretends to like the fruitcake...YAWN""","Spongebob Squarepants Christmas lives up to the lofty standards that this show has set for itself. Patchy the pirate introduces the first double length short ""Christmas Who?"" which is hilarious. The basic premise is that Spongebob and the rest of Bikini Bottom is unaware of the holiday until Sandy clues Spongebob in. Spongebob then spreads holiday joy by encouraging everyone to write a letter to Santa and wait for his impending arrival. Squidward, as always, is skeptical but winds up saving the day in the end. Overall, this is one of Squidward's funniest shorts, he has some classic one-liners such as ""Oh, I see a perfect photo-op"" or ""Yep, I'm insane"". You just cannot find a consistently funnier show than this and Spongebob Christmas lives up to the hype. Highly Recommended."
5,Spongebob's Christmas,"Includes a Double-Length episode plus, 3 merry episodes.Christmas Who? (From Season 2) (Double Length):Sandy brings Christmas to Bikini Bottom.Procrastination (From Season 2):Spongebob has one day to write is essay.Snowball Effect (From Season 3):Squidward joins Spongebob and Patrick's snowball war.Survival of the Idiots (From Season 2):Spongebob and Patrick are stuck inside Sandy's treedome while she hibernates."
5,Ratings of the episodes,"Christmas Who? (Double-length Episode!) - Great for this set. Duh.Procrastination - Not that Christmasy, but pretty good.Snowball Effect - Snow-theme makes it good for this DVD.Survival of the Idiots - Has snow, so good for this DVD.Mermaidman and Barnacleboy IV - No Christmas, but good.Chocolate with Nuts - Pretty good episode, but not christmasy.As Seen on TV - Momentary part makes it inappropriate for the DVD.Pizza Delivery - No Christmas, but good.Squeaky Boots - NAUSEATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Forget it Courtney,"For people seeking serious investigation into the UFO phenomenon this book is to be missed and stayed clear of. It offers some interesting intrigue but little in the way of proof as Courtney Brown claims. The book begins on a promising note that that the methods used are scientific and replicable and offer undisputable proof of UFO involvement on Earth. Doctor (I hestitate) Brown then leaps far away from this by using a controversial method to prove another controversial subject. A scientific no-no. The book offers beautiful points of thought and meditation, but it is a polluting piece of scientific work which should only be approached by people of a balanced nature and prior knowledge of the subject. Jumping in head-first is a very bad idea. Fun but foolish. And, hey, Brown, if this SRV stuff works so well, shouldn't you keep your time and resources to playing the lotto?"
5,Beautiful.,"mysterious and thrilling.The art,layout and storytelling is amazing.really really beautiful.."
2,My brain hurts,"WAY too surreal for me. UG!! My brain hurts. The quote from World Art on the back says ""incoherent but engrossing"" and that's sort of how I felt. I HATE stuff that's surrealist because I really WANT to understand, but can't quite. pooh!! Oh well. Still, very interesting, and the illustrations were amazing. (The potato-looking radiated-fish-baby is one of the most interesting characters I've ever encountered)"
3,It didn't do it for me,"It was all right, ok, not bad; but for me to rate it as 5*..not going to happen. I read it twice in three days and, while it was all the other reviews say it is, it just left me feeling ""ho-hum"". It is an excursion into fantasy that seems to serve no purpose. The only revelation I could get was that most of life seems to be a compilation of mis-directed endeavors brought about by little understood compulsions from the subconscious mind and that, like life, resolution is often not what we envision or desire. Okay; but still..just ""okay""."
5,Beatrice's life an update,If you love the book Beatrice's Goat then you must see this video.Beatrice is now in grad school in Arkansas but the video doesn't go quite that far into her future since it was made 5 years ago.You can see more up to date videos on the Internet now of her current life as her success continues.
1,Very Disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. The only 'help' I received from this book is the knowledge that if this author, in spite of the multiple typographical and grammatical errors in her book, could succeed as a Medical Transcriptionist, then I shouldn't have much difficulty becoming a Transcriptionist. This book was a waste of my time and my money."
2,From the Kitchen Table and Beyond,"I somewhat enjoyed the book but all the errors were very distracting. She should have had the book proofread first before printing.Although I felt there were a lot of good items I felt that the title was deceiving, I felt more discouraged than encouraged at the end."
1,From The Kitchen Table & Beyond,"While the author does have a sense of humor that moves the book along, not much practical, down and dirty, information. Also found the typos distracting."
3,Very funny,If you have a great sence of humor and you want to relax for a while and still learn about medical transcription then this book is for you. I felt as though I was having a girl to girl chat with Michelle around my kitchen table. She made it seem a quite easy and enjoyable road to become a medical transcriptionist. She did not however get into much detail about her topics and I found the book to be too short. I was indeed an good book for an hour of relaxing reading.
4,classic science fiction,"Earthlight is classic sf from the 50s about a guy going to the moon to try to find a spy in the upcoming war between Earth and the Federation at somewhere around the year 2150.I had to laugh at one description that had a bunch of women using electric typewriters, and another that had women again entering computer code on punch cards. And those were the only women in the book, other than the protagonist's absent wife.Kinda sad that this was how he envisioned the future."
5,One of Clarkes Best!,"In my opinion, this is easily the best thing Clarke has ever written. It is a little shorter than I would have liked, but its depiction of an interplanetary conflict between old mother Earth and the confederation of once upon a time ""colony"" planets is very well done. Although interisting and quirky characterizations are not among the reasons this book is good, it does discuss the nature and future of humanity itself, and explores this ambitious theme better than any other author I know of can. The battle at the end between the forces of Earth and the Confederation I thought was very well done. The speculation of the kinds of weapons that would be used were much more realistic or detailed than Star Wars or even other reputable science fiction authors such as Asimov or Heinlein. Definitely a book worth reading for any sci-fi fan."
4,"Restrained, thoughtful drama about moon exploration","I might be one of the few who still remember it - a little! A remarkably realistic - for its 50's time- and restrained, thoughtful drama about moon exploration/colonization. As an early teen reader when it came out, I considered it a little duller than I usually preferred, but I appreciated the scientific integrity - and Clarke is always interesting. It is NOT what is termed ""pulp fiction,"" by the way."
4,Quality,"There is no question - this is a GREAT and treasured bookas far as the information it has.However, we bought 8 copies and some were in acceptable condition while others had yellowed pages.Therefore I would advise you to always buy ""new"" to ensure good condition of the book.Also be mindful of the SIZE you want. There is a larger size of this same book and its cover is different.But this book will provide all the ground teaching you need to know about being spirit-filled, the gifts of the Holy Spirit - It will take you to the next, VERY ALIVE level in the Lord NOW!!!"
3,Not exceptional,"This book has good information and helpful understanding of the individual gifts. However, I found it not very well written, and also somewhat biased toward a pentecostal or ""Full Gospel"" understanding of the spiritual gifts, which is good, but I felt that he was not very well rounded in his understanding, presenting one interpretation only."
1,recipe cards and boxes,"I bought these to write my recipes on and give them to me teen grandkids so whenI'm gone, they can remember me with the things we cooked in my kitchen together.."
4,Good jazz,"The music here reminds me of Dizzy Gillespie in the 50's (one tune is named after him), and Gil Evans' work also. It's ""travelogue"" music. It's not Mingus' best music, but it's nice. The CD contains longer alternates of 4 of the tracks which bypass Mingus' ham-fisted tape edits and make for a better listening experience."
1,Missing 1 screen protector in each package.,"There is only 1 screen protector in each of the packages I recieved. The one works fine... but this was supposed to be a ""2-LCD kit"" and the missing screen protector is the one for the outer screen (which is the one we wanted).They charge $5 shipping & handling for each of these $0.01 items... what a rip-off!"
4,"SEX, SEX, SEX!",This was a great read! HOT! It was tons of sex all the time. If that's what you want this is perfect...I loved it! I immediately ordered the second book and have pre-ordered the third. Only 4 stars because it was too short! Hope this helps!
5,A must have book for any soapmaker.,"I have been making soap for several years. I do all methods, CP-HP-CPOP-HPOP-RTCP-MP, and I always find myself coming back to this book for inspiration of some sort. She explains the full history of soap as well as having some nice recipes and some easy additions to enhance any recipe. It is well written and the instructions are easy. A great book for a beginner as well an advanced soapmaker. One of my most favorite books in my soapmaking book collection (20+ books). I recommend this book for all soapers."
1,Antiquated,This was one of the first books I bought. Great for learning the history of soap making but not worth much on learning how to make soap. My advice is to save your money. This book is out-dated...
4,Simple and fun but ......,"After reading quite a few books on soapmaking,spending many hours on the Internet and finally making my own soap I have only recently read Ann Bramson's book.It is a nice fun book which makes you want to make soap! However I think it should not be a beginners book. Recipes are too big,lye should be poured into water and the amount of EO used is too much and too expencive."
1,Very Dissapointing!!,"I was really looking forward to this book, and sat right down to read it as soon as it arrived. And I was very dissapointed with it, a waste of money IMO. This book was made in 1975, so that tells you a lot right there. The books main focus and ingredient used is TALLOW..YUK..While some have no problem with animal fat in their soap, I have a huge problem with it, it stinks for one thing and I would never use it. If I had know this I would not have bought it. I didnt find anything in it I could use, or would want to."
4,A good tool to have on hand,"I would not recommend this as your ONLY soap book, but it is a great tool. I love Bramson's voice and tone throughout and the history is fun and kitschy. While this book is a little dated (the resources and prices are laughable), it is THE book to have if you want to make tallow soaps. Most of the newer books dismiss tallow as old-fashioned and pointless, so they do not offer instruction on rending it. Bramson makes it sound almost enjoyable! Love the book, but would recommendSoapmaker's Companion: A Comprehensive Guide with Recipes, Techniques & Know-How (Natural Body Series - The Natural Way to Enhance Your Life)orSmart Soapmaking: The Simple Guide to Making Traditional Handmade Soap Quickly, Safely, and Reliably, or How to Make Luxurious Handcrafted Soaps for Family, Friends, and Yourselfas actual guides."
1,"Sorry, no can do","This for me was a waste of my money, time and effort. Would not recommend this book at all. Didn't care for the history, completely boring for me and that is all I can say. Skip this book."
2,Don't buy this for recipes,"I took a soapmaking class and bought this book because I was told it was a basic book. It makes for some interesting readings, but, out of the four recipes, two use tallow and one uses lard. There is a whole chapter on how to buy tallow from your butcher and then take it home and render it, strain out the gristle, etc. In the soap recipe that uses lard, it says the soap may have a bacony smell. If this is your thing, then this book is for you. It just wasn't what I was looking for."
2,eh...soap making from years ago,"This book may have been the go to book way back when, but for the beginner in this day and age it's a flop. Who really makes soap with lard anymore? Do you really go to the butcher and ask for ingredients to put into your soap? Ew I hope not. Save your money and buy a book for this century."
2,Great for its time....but...,"...times have changed. That being said, I love this book....it's the book that got artisan soaping started and she has some lovely recipes. Her recipes do make good soap.Unfortunately, the last edition of this book was published in 1975. Methods have changed, safety precautions have changed (she didn't wear gloves because a lye burn was easier to deal with than the limited movement....WRONG....wear the gloves). She also adds water to the lye...this is inviting a volcano....just don't do it.On the plus side, there are great ideas for ""found"" molds, great ideas for shaping and sculpting your soap, and an interesting (if verbose) history of soap.I would recommend it for its historical value and great soap recipes, but invest in a more modern volume for your first attempts. Alicia Grosso and Anne Watson's books are up-to-date, safe, and much more friendly for the soaping newbie."
5,It's a pity that we can't buy the movie,"""L'Altalena"" the 3rd track of Mondo Candido is perhaps the most beautiful romantic music of all time. All the people I know say that this track superb!! If you have seen the movie ""Mondo Candido"" too you will never forget it."
5,Nicely Done,"This is a very nicely done book. It shows beautiful color photos of the finished flowers. The directions are done in a step by step easy to follow way. Alison Procter does a great job. As you go through the steps for each flower, there is also a step by step with a picture of the per piece item. It is very helpful to guide you through the process."
3,Warsaw Concerto,"The version of the toon was not what I expected. I wanted more the ""popular"" version."
5,Classic Movie Pieces,"I am a pinaist, and several of thses pieces find themselve in my repertoire, and by hearing them on this cd, one is able to truly appreciate the composition and performance of these songs, which are not very popular nowadays. A great collection that I highly recommend to all musicians and music lovers."
5,Velbon Neopod 7 one fantastic choice,"I use Velbon Neo Pod 7 and Manfrotto 3229 with my Canon EF 400mm f/5.6L USM. Who need IS (Image Stabilizer) with this fantastic combination? I get sharp pictures with this super telephoto. If you want a good monopod, this is the perfect option."
1,"didn't last 5 years, some welds broke off in 1 year","It is obvious the manufacturer skimped on the welding, using the least amount possible and the result is they aren't strongly welded together (which this bunk is 90% welds, only a few other screws). I used to have another metal bunk bed that lasted 20 years that eventually warped out of shape that had the full welds and never broke apart like this one did in one year.update: after owning this less than 5 years, many of the welds are failing, half of them are broken off under the bottom mattress and on the top railing. and if you have a large mattress on the bottom (like 9"") you can't sit up straight. They should have welded this properly."
4,Minor Classic,"While not the strongest of the Poirot books, Lord Edgware Dies is still a classic of the mystery genre. Containing most of the stock elements-- peerage, actresses, red herrings, and personality types-- it paints a very interesting character in the person of Jane Wilkinson."
4,"""Please help me get rid of my husband!""","This classic Poirot novel(alternative title- ""13 at Dinner"")is a good, quick read when you're in the mood for a mystery.What I particularly liked about the story, is that it takes you for a spin. At first it all seemed so obvious I got a little annoyed. And although it is all so obviously simple in the end, Christie does a wonderful job at making the reader, as well as her detective hero, believe otherwise. I also liked this one because it is narrated by Poirot's trusty sidekick, Captain Hastings(Christie's version of Dr. Watson)who ordinary man that he is, proves invaluable to Poirot, and ultimately is the one person who can help him.I Strongly recommend to any Christie fan, or anyone who just likes a good mystery now and then."
5,Lord Edgware Dies,Agatha Christie's books are always good. Intricate plot. Lots of twists and turns. Would recommend to those who like mysteries. There is a reason she has been popular for so many years.
4,Humdinger,"Christie throws so many red herrings into the plot, you won't be able to guess the outcome if you tried. Unless you're really perceptive. Jane Wilkinsin is one of her all time best creations. And the set up is great. It's always enjoyable when Hastings narrates the story, because you often feel as baffled as he does. Note: this is one of the few Hercule plots where ole Poirot himself almost can't solve the mystery..."
5,Great,This is a great book.You will enjoy the characters and plot.This is a classic Agatha Christie.The ending is ingenious.Buy this if you are a first time A/C reader.
1,Change in Publishers,I am collecting the Agatha Christie series and almost purchased this one based on the picture of the book. It is showing the picture of the Harper publication but is actually a different one published by William Morrow. Totally different cover from what is shown.Lord Edgware Dies: A Hercule Poirot MysteryThis is also true of most of the other Agatha Christie books. If you are going to change the books then at least show the correct covers. This will not fill out my set and I will need to purchase it somewhere else.
5,Excellent clear and concise guide to scientific illustration,I studied for three years with the author in Chicago. I recently picked this book up used and read it for the first time. I felt like he was in the room with me. The detail in his descriptions of how to render a subject are excellent. Clearly he went to great effort to describe in words what a scientific illustrator does when he or she works. I think this is one of the clearest guides for any person interested in materials and techniques of illustration. The only downside to the book is that the publisher did not reproduce some of the illustrations well. It was the only disappointment that I remember Mr.Jastrzebski mentioning regarding his book and I agree fully with him. Nevertheless the book is written so well it is worth it regardless.
3,Misinformed,"The jersey they sell IS A REPLICA, NOT AUTHENTIC AS STATED. Regardless, the jersey is nice, but was hoping for the advertised authentic."
4,It's a DOUGLAS!!!,"This is an Amazing Hammer!!! The BEST feature is the side pull on the hammer head for nails caught in Tight spaces!!! The groved head is very durable! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is just a bit too light. The 20 or 22 ounce hammer would have been better. The AXE handle is remarkably comfortable and does give it some extra force! Highly recommend this hammer, it is THE BEST!!!!"
3,Where's the ending?,"To be absolutely fair, I must say that I loved the book. It was a great read, kept my interest, had good character development, etc. The only thing wrong with it is that it just ended - period. No loose ends tied up, no completion. So, aside from that fact that I really enjoyed the read, I would have like to have had a whole book rather than an ending that puts me in mind of meeting a deadline."
3,"Golden Lasso, good until the end","This book was a very good read, and up until the end I was completely hooked. I read it in one day. Unforunately the ending was terrible, because it just ended in 1 or 2 paragraphs. She was crying and then all of a sudden she was in love. Other then the ending the book was good, but it left me longing to know, well what happened after that? It never really ended. I wouldn't suggest reading it without having a great imagination so you can make your own ending up."
1,Not Micheal Jackson,"Usher's album has only 2 good songs:1. Yeahand 2. My boo w/ Alicia KeysHe is a Micheal Jackson wannabe and is butt-ugly. His major competitor Frankie J is much hotter, actually can sing, and doesn't play with wh@res! Sorry Usher, but your album only got 1 star from me!"
3,Get your genres right!,"Um, Usher is not rap music. When will people learn. It isn't R&B either. It's urban pop. OR hip pop. Whichever you wish."
2,A Waste,"Well, for whatever, the original edition of this sold like hotcakes so what does Usher's record comapany decide to do? Well, milk the artist for all he's worth, of course. So they repackage it and release a new *and horrible* single called ""My Boo."" With it's opening line ""There will always be that someone that will always have your heart"" I fell like I'm listening to a Hallmark card jingle. Very bad. The only single that was good was ""Yeah"" but it was horribly overplayed.Usher is very overrated. He has one of the biggest egos in teh buisness and people buying his albums is just feeding that over-enflated head of his. Down with Usher and overplayed, overrated hip hop artists!"
4,not 4 every body,"If you liked ""yeah"" you'll probaly hate the rest of this album. when i got this cd i wuz surprised that most of the songs on here were slow, their not boring they just slow, and right now i know that everyone's into crunk-happyGarbage. That's why i say this album may not be for every body, because i listen the Lil jon and Lil scrappy ECT, and some songs on this cd made me board. i hate confessions part 2 and 1, maybe cause they play them on the radio so much. If you want to hear ""URSUR"" crying for a hour pick up Confessions.FAV SONGS.YEAH (PLAYED OUT)!!!!!!BAD GIRLLET IT BURN (PLAYED OUT)!!!!!!"
4,Confessions I love to hear!!!!!!!,Wow! Usher had definetly done it with this album. After his breakup with Chili he did a lot of writing and it paid off. The whole incident is almost a good thing in some crazy way. My fave songs are:Confessions pt.2ThrowbackSuperstarThat's what it's made forCan you handle it?Do it to meIts a great album and i reccomend it to all! :)
3,Could have been better...,"I bought this CD the first day it came out because I love Usher and his work. I expected great things but not a whole album on his cheating ways and how misses Chilli. By track 6 I'm like okay Usher I got it already.. you made a mistake. I seriously haven't listened to the entire CD since I bought it. My favorite track is ""Throwback"" and the only other upbeat songs next to ""Yeah!"" which would be ""Caught Up"". ""Burn"" is a great ballad and I think anyone can relate to this track. But after track 7 this CD pretty much bores me."
4,Not bad.,"This is not a bad CD. It's still growing on me but I know after a while, I'll think that it's da bomb."
1,Junk,"I borrowed this CD to find out what all the hype is about. You know what, it's just HYPE! If I could, I would rate this CD -5 stars. I never want to hear the word yeah again. It's a shame one word can be made into a song. Maybe Usher and Ashanti have discovered that people will buy songs based on one word. It's YEAH for Usher and BABY for Ashanti. Someone especially his best friend and mother should tell him he's not Michael Jackson, one is enough. I know it's a great compliment to someone to have admiration for them enough to do an impression, but Usher has taken it too far. We know he can ""copy"" dance, but what can he do on his own? In the future, how would someone do an impression of Usher? Will it be a young man doing an impression of Usher doing an impression of Michael Jackson? He really needs to get his own style."
1,Why was this so big?,"It is true that Usher CAN sing, but his voice could be lost in the army of male r&b singers. It is ordinary. The material - nothing really grounbreaking, same old topics, r&b cliches, no new beats, nothing very innovative. The image- nothing new, still the same old cocky, self absorbed guy. Now we get this useless re-issue, a way to cash in for BMG isn't it? The new tracks don't make up for the disaster and decpetive hype of this overrated album and artist."
1,YOU'RE A OVERPLAYED SUCKA.,"THIS ALBUMIS GARBAGEI DIDNT LIKE IT ONE BITEI THOUGHT IT HORRIBLEI DONT UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE GET SO HYPED BEHINDHIM HIS MUSIC IS COOL BUT THIS ALBUM IS DREADFULTHERE ARE ONLY A FEW STANDOUT TRACKS THE OTHERSARE BAD,IM DONE TYPING SH*T ABOUT THISALBUM,I RECOMMOND ANYONE NOT TO BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Just ok....,"There is nothing wonderfull about this CD...its just and ok CD.I just like 3 songs on there Yeah, Burn and Confessions. His Last Cd was much much better. I would rather recommend Damito Jo if u want to listen to ur whole cd without skipping a beat"
2,Don't even dare to compare...,"...with usher's previous releases ""My Way"" and ""8701"". One can only find three good songs on this cd. ""Yeah!"", ""Burn"" and ""Throwback"". The rest is boring, mid-tempo filler material. The question is: ""Which song is Usher gonna release from this lame cd after Throwback?"".... Oh I know, he won't have to, 'cause this hyped release will already have quadruple platinum status. Shame on the industry! Buy Anthony Hamilton instead! Peace out!"
3,"Some songs are catchy, some not","I liked the song Yeah by Usher when I heard it on the radio during PE [don't ask.] I liked it because it was catchy, and wasn't your average rap. It was pretty easy to understand. But I only give this album three stars because some of the songs are catchy, like My Boo, Yeah!, Burn, and Bad Girl, the rest are kinda ordinary."
5,Usher the Ultimate Performer,"USHER RAYMOND IS THE ULTIMATE PERFORMER. I HAVE WATCHED USHER PROGRESS FROM A LITTLE KID TO THE 'MAN'. CONFESSIONS IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER. EVERY SONG ON HERE IS HOT. HIS REMIXES ARE EXCELLENT. AND IF YOU LISTEN TO TRACK FIFTEEN. BETTER MAKE SURE YOU GOT SIGNIFICANT OTHER, BECAUSE THIS SONG IS EVEN HOTTER. USHER RAYMOND HAS DEFINTELY MATURED ON THIS ALBUM. HE DEFINTLEY IS GOING TO REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO OUT DO HIS NEXT ALBUM WHEN IT COMES OUT, BECAUSE CONFESSIONS IS GOING TO BE A CLASSIC. THANK YOU USHER FOR THE GOOD WORK."
3,Three Stars For 3 Songs,"Don't get me wrong. Usher is my favorite singer of all time.8701 was probably the most superb album of his entire career, and I couldn't wait for the next one.I was very disappointed when I bought this one.Confessions, Burn, and Yeah! are the only good songs.I have tried hard to listen to others, but I can't find any good tunes or lyrics or anything to it.This album made me happy for only a little while, because 3 songs can get boring quickly."
4,More intellingent!,"Usher's music here is much more intelligent, if you know what I mean. I like it better. It's more serious."
2,Not good!,"I don't get what all this hyps is about this cd. It's not even that good. Very overrated. i have to admitt that ""Yeah"" and ""Burn"" were good tracks but his third single ""Confession(pt2) has to be one of the worst tracks i have ever heard in my entire life. It has no point and it lacks substance. The beat is just awful. And the other ok songs are ""Caught up"" and ""Bad girl"" and thats it. This cd will be in the rash can soon. All usher talks about on this cd is relationships. Man give us something we haven't heard yet. Dont' buy this cd. trust me. You will be disappointed. U mind as well just buy the singles ""Yeah"" and ""burn"", but dont buy this cd. Its not recommended and even my best freinds heard it and they don't even like it."
3,Way overrated,"This album is okay... to many album fillers if ya ask me.""8701"" is a much better album and Janet's ""Damita Jo"" is too!!"
2,TOO MUCH HYPE....,"I can't lie...By seeing and hearing about ushers new album i got drawn in...I liked ""Yeah"" so i said i'd give it a shot...I wish I did't waste my money...Why do people like this album so much...Maybe because it's usher and not for the actual music...i don't know but it isn't ""A MASTERPIECE""..It's a bad try by a entertainer...(FOR THE RECORD USHER ISN'T A MUSICIAN HE'S A ENTERTAINER...THERE IS A DIFFERENCE)..Neway I won't continue to ramble about this album....HONESTLY...Three good tracks at best...The Total Truth..."
1,"Very, Very Average","Of Usher's big name CDs (My Way, 8701, Confessions) this is by far the worst. All of Usher's albums have had some filler but this album is packed full of it masquerading as what he and the teeny boppers of the world are calling ""real R&B"". Some reviewers here have called Usher a genius and the new Marvin Gaye. Thats one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard. Look at the songwriting and production credits for this album, there are a number of songs where Usher didn't write a word (including ""Yeah"") and most other songs he co-writes with about 3-10 other people. He also didn't produce a single track. Some genius. The only genius I give him credit for here is the fact that he's conned so many people into buying this album. If you want to listen to some real soul/R&B music by some of the real male R&B geniuses listen to some Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder or R. Kelly."
1,don't get me wrong I love usher,"I loved usher when he put out his last 2 records and had good quality music on it but this album did nothing for me. Sure his vocal skills and his body have gotten better but his songwriting is weak and the music sounds like a bad parody of his previous music and it's sad how usher didn't get all the attention until he cheated on chilli, says a lot about how society puts up men who do that don't it? I would stay far away from this album. And as for his dancing I've seen it all before, he rips off michael jackson and you kids need to know that usher is NOT the king of dance or any of that stuff"
1,Terrible,"This is his worst masterpiece at this time. There was nothing new from this album ; the same from his last album. Freeze-dried, unchoky R&B songs that ain't worth listenin to. This is a lot of waste in money."
5,Give me a break,"Many of the reviewers are being a little hard on Usher. He is what he is; a great entertainer (good singer, great dancer, great showman). Essentially, however, Usher is a great businessman. Confessions was the biggest album of 2004 hands down and produced one of the most profitable tours as well. So of course the businessman is striking while the iron is hot and giving his fans what they want: more Usher. The special edition is fine...he didn't go wrong with the original. There are two remixes and three new songs. My boo and Seduction are my favorites. But please let's give Usher a break and give credit where credit is due."
3,This CD is SO SO,"THis is is ok, just only one song that I liek is MY boo.and FYI for hte guy with the review below me... ""MY BOO PT2"" never existed, and Beyonice NEVER SING THAT SONG! it was sung by a girl that have a voice simmilar to Beyonce in teh early demo of the song. Alicia Keys Confirmed this. Just a little info."
1,What's All the Hype About,"This album did NOTHING for me! I love the song Burn, and that's actually the reason I bought the CD. I wish I had kept my money. If you really want to hear a REAL singer, cop that new Carl Thomas. Guaranteed satisfaction."
2,Disappointing,"I was very excited to buy this album and I was really disappointed. ""Yeah!"" and ""Burn"" are excellent songs and that's why I bought the album. I have to say now that I wished I wanted longer instead of wasting money on this mediocre album. 2 great singles does not make a worthwhile album."
3,Not bad but not the best!,"This album is ok but not amazing,it has been hyped way to much I got this album the day it was released cause of all the hype!I think his last effort knocks this effort into the water!"
4,Good but could be better,"I gotta give it to Usher he promoted his album right and came out with a hot song in time for the spring. Him and Ludacris always make a good match for a Hip-Hop/R&B hit. The rest of the album tho had it's moments. Ballads like ""Burn"" and ""Can You Handle It"" are very nice and true to his form from the last album. The other slow songs ""Throwback"", ""Confessions Pt.2"", and ""That's What It's Made For"" a very good the have nice tempo and good lyric content. They make for for very good songs that could be singles in there own right. Also the mid-tempo ""Caught Up"" is great and should be the next single after ""Burn"". The rest of the album just didn't seem to match these and are seen in my eyes as album fillers. I like Usher I just think he was half an album away from the title of a truly classic album. But he definately did some good work on this album and it is worth the buy."
3,My Confessions (Single-Driven Album),"Personally, Usher is one of the best R&B artists out there, but ""Confessions"" is to me a single-driven album. ""Yeah!"" was a tight song but even now it is played out and it is pointless to me to get this CD. Usher is a great artist, and ""Can You Handle It?"" and ""Burn"" are good songs, but other than that nothing else is. ""Confessions"" got too much hype and it was a let down for me and compared to ""8701"", it wasn't even close. Most of the songs sound the same. I give it 3 1/2 out of 5 stars!!!"
5,"Please Buy IT!!! ""U"" will Enjoy!","This album is worth buying! I know everyone will enjoy it he has fast songs like ""Yeah"" and ""Bad Girl"" then he have the slow songs like ""Burn"",""Do it to me"",and ""Thats what its made for"" I cant even pick a favorite song because this album is Great!"
5,So Good,"If you haven't picked up Usher's newest CD ""Confessions"" you must be crazy! This CD is so good its on a completeley different level than anything out right now. Hot tracks like Confessions pt1 and 2 Burn, Follow me and of course the smash hit burn you can listen to this cd from start to finish. EVERYBODY GO GET THIS CD AND TELL YOUR FRIENDS IT IS THE BEST CD OF 2004 NO DOUBT!!!!"
5,Whole new Level!,"Usher has reached a whole new level with this one! hes knocked it outs tha park! i love every song on this album, my number one favorite song is Confessions part 2 and then probably burn and then yea, but everyone song has the ability to be a hit! maybe even the interludes, lol"
3,I love him but not this isn't his best,"I will always support Usher but I am not into this album.. I think I will have to listen to it a few times and hopefully it will grow on me.Another *HOT* album coming out, Janet's ""Damita Jo"" in stores March 30th, I have never been a fan of Janet and I'm definitely not fond of her single but I'm impressed with this album b/c it's fire w/ lots of Urban/R&b!!!Ya'll go cop that!!"
1,"I confess, This is c--rap",I didn't know they gave grammy nominations for dancing in video clips. I guess anything is possible in this world.
3,Usher,"I'll admit that I'm an Usher fan. But re-releasing an album is not right in my opinion. Fans pay tons of money for albums, concerts, and merchandise, and then you re-release an album with a couple other songs on it for the exact same price or more as the original? That's not right. Confessions, however, is still a great album, but please, stick to the original album."
3,Decent Effort,This ablum I can berely find a song that is good that wasn't a single. Yeah his singles are great but the whole album? No he doesn't even have Connfesion Part 1 and he making everyone buy that new album for only 4 more songs! Yeah he has a nice voice and he can dance that is about all he has going for him.. Unless he starts writing better SONGS! and making the album overal good not just his singles
2,I'm trying to debate 1 star or 2 stars,"I love Usher, I really do. I was a fan of his when he first came out, when NO ONE knew him. I love My Way...LOVED 8701, his best piece of work to date...so naturally, I ran out, got Confessions. I WAS SOOOO DISAPPOINTED. I like Throwback and Caught Up but after that, it was just a waste of time and money. (And NO this CD is NOT better than Justified!!). I don't care how much it sold in the first week, I don't care if it goes diamond. I mean so did Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer!! This cd was PURE GARBAGE. Usher needs to come off of his HIGH HAT and come out with a better CD that that Confessions garbage..."
4,boo,"This is an awesome album. I have personally heard better of Usher, (My Way) but I definately recommend confessions, has some sexy flows, and erotic beats. I would buy it, even after I already bought it!"
4,"HOT Album, but tries too hard, to hit high notes","This is hot, but Usher is trying way to hard to hit high notes on his songs. Sometimes it doesn't come out right. For example, ""Can U Handle It"" he sounds like a screeching cat. Stand out tracks= 3,7,16,17. 17 is real and to the point. The song ""Throwback"" is another smash by the production of Just Blaze. This CD is a must have and if haven't already gotten it. I mean his album is doing big thangs on the charts."
1,Nasty and greedy,"Wake up people. Usher is all about greed. Did you see him at the MTV awards? His yacht was the biggest and fastest, and he wanted to let everyone know that. It's disgusting. This guy has so much, and now re-releases this album, which the ""working poor"" of America will run out like a bunch of sheep to buy. And what for? Four new songs? Why not release a commercial single for ""My Boo?"" Or an EP? Or a new album, with those four new songs, plus a few others floating around, and ""Confessions Part 1,"" and maybe some holiday tracks which I'm sure Usher could afford to record, and really make it worth the money? No, because people are greedy and stupid, and the evil jerks in charge of this already know how mindless Usher's fans are, and they'll spend their welfare checks on this re-release so Usher can get richer and richer. Give me a break people. This is why America, overrun with selfishness and greed, is going the way of the Roman Empire."
1,This is ehat usher is all about....,CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAPCRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAPCRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAPCRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAPCRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAPCRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAPCRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAPCRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAPCRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAPCRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP
3,The album is just okay,"Of course this album was highly anticipated because he came out with the BEST songs on the album to get people interested in it, smart move Ursha.This album will definitely go down in sales b/c the album doesn't offer the hotness just mediocre material.If ya'll want a hot album then get Janet's ""Damita Jo"" in stores Tuesday, her single is nothing compared to the hotness she brings in this album, great production(big ups to Kanye), and some nasty lyrics.Ms. Jackson definitely did her thing on this one, skip ""Confessions"" and get ""Damita Jo""."
3,Buy it if you don't have Confessions,"Usher's on a roll, no denying it. The man's comin' off a multi-platinum release, and three chart-topping singles, ""Yeah!"", ""Burn"", and ""Confessions Pt. 2"", which I'm sure you've already heard. What you may not know is, Usher's been in the game for a while now, finally blowing up for real in 2001 with the album ""8701"".Usher's a talented dude, he can sing and dance, and he puts on a good show. I think he deserves to be at the top of the charts unlike most chart-topping artists this year. If you love Usher, but don't own Confessions for some reason, pick this up. You get the 17 tracks included on Confessions, plus 4 new cuts, although ""My Boo"" with Alicia Keys is probably the most lackluster single Usher's released this year. The Confessions pt. 2 remix with Shyne, Kanye West and Twista is nice though. This special edition album is worth pickin' up if you don't have the album already and you're a fan of Usher past singles out this year."
2,Very boreing.......,This is perhaps that most over-hyped cd of the year. The album is very perducatble the entire time thru and boreing. Is he a good singer? Yes of cource but he just played it really safe with this disc.
1,Tedious,"This is dull. It isnt a great album at all. I liked ""Yeah"", but they overplay it now. All of Ushers music sounds the same. He needs to create some new stuff. I suggest before you buy this, borrow it or download it first to see if you like it."
1,New Usher Album,Usher is probably one of the most wack R&B artists in the business today. His tracks are nothing to talk about. He's a young R&B artist with a six pack who can do a few Michael Jackson dance moves. Cop this album if you're a girl who has no character or if you're a guy who is helpless when it comes to the ladies.
1,"R n' B=fake, shallow, soulless, no originality","This is a music genre which hasn't yielded anything good since the '70's. It is awash in a sea of polished, pre-packaged hip hop beats, overdone vocals and song writing with NO sense of blues, despite the moniker of ""rhythm and blues"". I hate Usher and all of his like.Give me some Al Green or Curtis Mayfield"
1,My Confession-This Album Is Terrible,"This album is just horrendous.If i had 2 choose listening 2 this album again or taking a shot of acid,id take the shot of acid.This album would make a midget wanna commit suicide,...absolutely horrible"
2,trying,"his music is good, but once i have heard a song a couple of times, i forget about his songs, no sure why. sorry. i love kanye west, christina aguilera, these artists put some serious emotions and messages in there music that makes me want to listen to them again, and again."
2,Confessions CD review,I was expecting great things from this CD but came away disappointed. I've enjoyed all the previously released songs from Usher but all the other ones on the CD sounded just alike. And what's up with 21 songs on a CD? I think that's a little excessive.
2,coughs,album cover 2 starslyrics and tune 2 starssinging 4 stars2.8i hear variations of this song everywhere. its not original at all.
3,Its OK...,"I expected way more from Usher..Maybe it just has to grow on me. Songs that I loved right off the bat was ""Burn"" and ""Truth Hurts"", and of course ""Yeah""..other than that, the cd will have to grow on me..""Confessions"" (about getting another girl pregnant)I hope that wasnt Usher."
2,Not impressed....,"Usher's ""Confessions"" is a bit of a dissapointment judging from the first 2 singles I was expecting something on FIRE but he didn't give it to me.If you want a good Usher album then purchase ""8701"" if you haven't because it is MUCH better than this album."
4,Yes,"This is a good cd, it was really hyped, so you would think that it's really a dull with a lot of publicity. It's not, it's good. His videos and appearances for this album are not as stellar as the his vocal talents. The cd is an example of his vocal talents which are pretty strong. Prepare yourself, at times, he does however forget that he's not Mariah Carey, and goes over board with the high pitches. Other then that, it's a good cd."
4,Usher!Hooray!,OMG Usher is so amazing with an amazing voice to go with it!He can dance he can sing is there anything he CANT do?I didnt give this CD 5 stars becuz i dont have it but i luv all the songs ive heard by him on the radio and he's a great mixture of R&B and hip hop.I usually dont like that type of music in fact i hate most of it except for a couple exceptions but this is a CD i can enjoy!
2,Nothing but generic R'B..........buy Tonex's albums instead,"I heard the album thru a friend of mine and it is far from a classic or masterpiece. Just the typical ""Oh baby, sorry for cheating on you, come back to me"" type of songs. Don't waste your money. If you want something with a fresh new sound get Tonex's albums, ""O2"", and ""Pronounced Toe-Nay"". You can find them here on Amazon. Peace and Love."
2,Did Usher go Catholic???!,"Why is Usher getting such raves? Yes, YEAH was a pretty awesome dance hit, but everything since then has been such mush....and even YEAH has grown weary in my ears since the radio can't ever stop playing it! Just like all of the other R&B artists out right now, after a couple listens, it gets old. Usher, you can do better than this....."
5,Hold up haters,"I mean, what's the problem?? I constantly hear people complaining about this was a horrible CD and all, when this was actually one of the BEST CD's this year!! Do ya thang Usher.... This CD is truly worth buying...."
3,"Older White Woman says ""Not Black Enough""","Unlike many reviewers, I'm not scared to say I'm lily-white. There is no reason in denying your heritage by pretending to be black or any other race. That said, if there is one thing I believe I know, it is black folks. I've sponsored several in my time, and feel I have contributed greatly to that sector of society. In my youth, I was a rarity: a white female participating in the civil rights movement along with many blacks. Now I see that good and bad comes out of everything, and the downside of our struggle against oppression is ""artists"" like Usher. His music tries to cut it both ways, and commercially he has suceeded in attracting a large non-black following. But it is at the expense of authenticity. You'd be far better off spending your money on a Marvin Gaye cd."
2,I'm not feelin' it,"I bought this album because I have been a fan of Usher's since 1993. And I must say that I am very dissapointed in ""Confessions"". All that hype for nothing. I liked some of the songs on there, but none of them grabbed me. I'm tired of hearing ""Yeah"" on the radio so not even that song grabbed me anymore. I guess I will stick to his first album and call it a day."
2,..and this is a 'comeback'.,"I just can't understand why this album is selling so much. It must be because there hasn't really been anything for it to compete against. I actually did want to buy this album, but I previewed it first. I'm glad that I didn't waste my money. I will list the tracks that are worth anything-Yeah (if you aren't sick of it by now, which I pretty much am), Burn, and Bad Girl (This is better than the hits) I would definitely suggest downloading/previewing tracks to see if this is your cup of tea. It sure isn't mine. I do like other material of Usher's, so I'm not biased in any way. This is my opinion based on the album material. Side note: I think Usher is becoming quite full of himself-read Rolling Stone's article where he was featured."
4,I DONE A REVIEW ON THIS WITH 2 STARS BUT WOT WAS I THINKIN??,"okay, this is an amazing, pure & vocally talanted album that DELIVERS. Id give it 5 stars if it werent 4 the fact that he hardly writes or produces any of his stuff which im miffed about seeing as their r some amazing songs on here.the stand-out trax r...2:-) yeah! ft. ludacris & lil' jon - every1s fave and i can totally c y. it is a funky, hot tune that makes me sing. its really catchy. 10/105:-) confessions pt. II - either this or yeah is my fave. its so beautiful and obviously confessional with true meaning. 10/106:-) burn - a gr8 ballad with gd words & sound, nice, slow, and simple. 9.5/107:-) caught up - funky fast tune. i luv it! 10/1012:-) bad girl - SO funky & brilliant, man!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10'take your hand' 'follow me' 'throwback' 'do it 2 me' and all the othas r real gd 2.NOTE: my other review is called 'kinda dissapointing after a 2 year break'. WOT WOZ I THINKING????????????"
5,Awesome CD!,"I absolutley love Usher and this cd is so cool! I first heard Yeah and i fell in love with it. So I am so glad that i am purchasing it off of amazon! I have heard this cd w/ a player online and it is very good. At first it seemed like one of those crunk cds cuz lil jon was on it and i thought it wasnt gonna be good but it is so gooood! It's also a great album to listen to and relate to the songs in some way. Having ur heart broken by your first love, cheating on your boyfriend or girlfriend and then cheating on them and wishing you hadnt! I love this CD and I hope other people will take my advice and buy it!!"
3,WAYYYYYYYYYY TOOO MUCHHH HYPEEEEE.....,Lol..the way people talkin bout usher these days you'd think he was Al Greene or Marvin Gaye or sumthin....Yes Usher is a OK artist...but all the hype isn't necessary...especially when there are probably 3 good songs tops on the whole album..Wow he's tellin stuff that happened....ok...he cheated....wow...buy this to hear all about how he sorry....<<<HEYALL NAWWW...IF YOU WANNA HEAR IT BAD ENOUGH JUS DOWNLOAD IT...NOT WORTH THE MONEY....TRUST....~DUECE~
4,Excellent!!,"This is an excellent CD, I really enjoy it.To the fan from Macon, Georgia, Michael Jackson may be going through some legal matters right now, but he's not out of the game. He's a living legend, and Usher's idol. If it wasn't for Michael there would be no Usher, nuff said."
5,you fools know nothing!!! stop trying to help JT,"you clowns know nothing and stop writing fake reviews just to help out justin timberlake, because this is probably the most decent cd coming out this year and your crushing it. When Justin came out you were giving him props but when usher comes out who is far more talented and experienced because he doesn't chap his lips on pharrel and chads asses just to get hits because this album has no sign of the neptunes and this album has some of the hottest beats out this year!!! If you don't like this album it's because 1.your not listening to it properly 2. your still kissing justins ass. P.S don't be surprised when his next single hit no.1."
2,Well...,"Usher sings R&B;, so, of course, I'm not going to have too many nice things to say about this album. R&B; is just too slow, and unexciting for me. The only song on this CD that I like, although trashy, is ""Yeah!"". It is faster, and is a great dance song. ""Confessions"" bothers me, as it does many kids, and I can barely make myself listen to it. The song is incredibly innapropriate, probably one of the trashiest I've ever heard. Although it talks about truth.Usher is a talented singer/dancer, and needs to give up the trash. Only talentless singers act like trash. Overall, I would recommend rock/alternative artist Jonny Lang, and Christian rock band Kutless over Usher.(...)"
1,I Confess...USHER SUX,"there..those r my confessions...6 million records sold and 4 #1 singles off so far aint gonna get me to like the guy and also make me think he's talented..his voice is too feminine in that ""My Boo"" song..USHER IS OVERRATED..really his music and the rereleasing of cds is pathetic..schemes to make more money is cheap..take other artists who sing write their own songs and really ARE TALENTED(now it doesnt mean just cuz they do both dont mean theyre so fukin talented)...maybe this is more of a confession to say HE CANT SING AND CANT WRITE..he uses far too much sexuality to sell music..thats not art..he should consider ""porn star"" if he wants to be bare ass naked...much of what hes releasing lately is not too friendly to the ear...And its true..too many people r on the R/B-Hip-Hop wagon..i miss the old R/B-Hip/Hop artistry when it was more real...this music aint worth SHIT"
1,A concept album?,"This is supposed to be a concept album, it seems like him just rambling on about his girl leaving him... If you want some good concept albums try Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" or King Crimson's ""In The Court of The Crimson King"" Usher SUCKS!! and I am really 15 but I am too lazy to make an acount."
1,Awful. Really Awful........,"This album is really bad. After 8701, I expected Usher to come back with another hardhitting album. This is awful. All his song are on the same topic. ""I'm sorry I cheated on you Chilli please forgive me"". This is a poor excuse for an album. If you like this album you do not like Rnb, but cheesey pop. Usher go back to yourself......."
1,"Overplayed, overhyped!",Too much radio airplay = sick of this tired song.MTV creates another monster.
1,"A rap artist stealing other people's sounds , how typical !","Usher ,in his Confessions album used keyboard riffs which were taken from my songs , without my permission and without paying for it.In his song called ""Yeah"" , synthesizer riffs were taken from my song ""Girl from Istanbul"" , which I had composed and posted on my website , before christmast 2003 , way before Usher's album was released.Rap artists(and producers) like him are stealing other people's songs and sounds just to sell albums and make money , but the general public is considering them great artists , which is a shame really!To have your unbiased opinion about this subject , please visit my website Anatolia.iuma.com and give a listen to my song "" Girl from Istanbul ""Regards."
2,This album is GREAT! wait...no its not..,"Although ""Yea"" is one of my favorite songs at the moment, and I can't stop singing or listening to ""Burn,"" the album isn't all that great...unless you're a 45 year old woman taking a bubble bath. Its pretty much a bunch of lovey dovey love songs. I bought it because I thought there would be atleast ONE other fast paced song liek ""Yea"" but there definately is not. They are ALL slow and mushy. Usher does have a great voice though. He just needs to find some songs to better show off his talent. I gave this album 2 stars, because there are only 2 good songs on this cd."
5,"Liked it a lot, creative!","Not at all my preferred style of music but must say it is both creative and a good listen. Glad I picked up a copy and have been listening to it for a week straight. Of course, all good things must come to a end (maybe next week). My officemate does not seem to mind it either which is a good sign."
4,a pleasing album - better than 8701 and My Way. Go cop it.,"Usher has matured over the - what - four years of doing this album. The album has some relaxing slow jamz on it (eg. ""Throwback"" ""Confessions Part II"", ""Burn"", ""Simple Things"", etc.), tinged with some killer songs for the dancefloor (eg. the world famous beats of ""Yeah"", ""Caught Up"", ""Bad Girl"", etc.). Some of my favourites are ""Confessions Part II"", ""Burn"", ""Caught Up"", ""Can U Handle It"", and - whilst its extremely overplayed - ""Yeah"". ""Follow Me"" ""Throwback"" ""Bad Girl"" and ""Superstar"" are all really good as well, though. Whilst this CD may not be a life-changing one, its still worth buying.PS: Usher's really good, but his extreme popularity is kind of annoying, what's he done to get sooo much praise?"
1,This Is Trash!!!,"This album is complete trash!!! If You Wan't to listen to real R&B go buy the Ginuwine ""Back II Da Basics"" Album"
3,Good but could be better,"Although Confessions is satisfying overall, there are just too many misses here. But what is good on here is REALLY good. Tracks like Bad Girl, That's What It's Made For and Follow Me are the standouts. Just don't expect this album to blow you away."
3,Mostly Every Song Works,"It takes me awhile to get use to music when I first buy it, so that is maybe why I did not like Usher's ""Confessions"" that much. Now that I gave it a few more spins, I can say that this album delivers! Though none of the songs are as fast and dance-like as ""Yeah!"" the rest seems to be more mid-tempo and make you want to keep listening. I say that you should go out and purchase this album if you truely like R&B because it is worth it."
2,Not Very Good,"I am glad we borrowed this album from my husband's sister before we wasted our money. The first half of the album was OK, but then it went downhill."
2,"""8701"" and ""My way"" was WAY better","I have been waiting for sooo long for Usher to have another CD, and much to my dissapointment, this CD was nothing compared to the other ones he had. The songs were basically the same catch to the old songs, but worse. Nothing New, nothing surprising, not worth it....As much as I love Usher, THIS IS REALLY NOT WORTH IT!"
2,A Waste of Plastic,"The only reason I bought this CD was because I fell in love with the song ""Burn"".Otherwise this CD is shiit. I listened to it a dozen time when I first bought it in hopes of a decent song but I was let down. I think I'll go back to listening to my 8701 CD."
1,Half an album,Only half of the songs will play. Nothing after track 10 will play even though there are 21 tracks. I tried on 3 different cd players.
3,So disappointed,"I was so happy when I got the cd in the mail, but sadly when the cd got to track 13 it skipped. No scratches, no fingerprints, brand new cd and it skips :("
1,QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD,"I have to get this off of my chest. Against my will, I have heard the song ""My Boo"", oh say, about 100 times in the past few weeks. I say against my will because the airhead that sits on the other side of my partition at work has her radio on all day long. The staion that she has it tuned to must play it about 4 or 5 times a day. Oh, and she sings along with it too. Joy. The only thing worse than hearing ""My Boo"" by Usher and Alicia is hearing ""My Boo"" by Saira. There is nothing about this song that makes sense. From the inane title, (what is a ""Boo"" anyway?) to the reason why it has become such a huge hit. They lyrics are insipid and the melody sounds like it was written by a first grader. I could go on and on but really, why would I waste my time? If this poor excuse for a song wins ANY Grammy award, (which I know it will) I think I just may have to go postal on my co-worker. Because it's people like her that made it the hit that it is."
3,Not my fav.,"Okay, so what guy is any good if all he sings about is cheating on his girls? Getting one pregnant? Holy!!! This album did not impress, but it did not fail to make it its way to my stereo. THe album is good, but I'd get 8701 over Confessions anyday."
1,"A rap artist stealing other people's sounds , how typical !","Usher ,in his Confessions album used keyboard riffs which were taken from my songs , without my permission and without paying for it.In his song called ""Yeah"" , synthesizer riffs were taken from my song ""Girl from Istanbul"" , which I had composed and posted on my website , before christmast 2003 , way before Usher's album was released.Rap artists(and producers) like him are stealing other people's songs and sounds just to sell albums and make money , but the general public is considering them great artists , which is a shame really!To have your unbiased opinion about this subject , please visit my website Anatolia.iuma.com and give a listen to my song "" Girl from Istanbul ""."
4,Good Usher Album,"A lot of people have been dissing this new Usher CD, but I actually liked it. Granted, some of the songs get old and it seems like he is singing about the same old stuff, and it is kind of long, but overall, it is a pretty good album.My Favorite Songs:Yeah!ThrowbackConfessions Parts I & IIBurnCaught UpTruth HurtsBad GirlSimple ThingsMy BooThe album is good for listening to, Usher really opens up and brings his passion to his music. It's like the album is telling a story of his mistakes he has made in a relationship, like you are his best friend and are learning his secrets, making him closer to you which I liked. Some of the songs (preferably tracks 13-17) got a little boring, but the end of the album packed a punch with the Confessions remix. If you like Usher, this is a good investment. ;)"
2,Never put Usher's name in the same sentence as R. Kelly,"I have been very upset with people trying to compare Usher to The King.(R. Kelly) For one thing Usher doesn't even write his own songs by himself, he is not a producer, and cannot sing anywhere remotely close to the vocals(let along sing at all) of the 'R'. I admit he is a good dancer, so leave it at that, just simply entertainment.... not brilliance. Oh and those aren't even his confessions!!!!(boy was I pissed when I found that out)"
4,Needs more dance hits,"This is a good cd. ""Burn"" ""Yeah"" ""Confession"" ""Caught Up"" are obviously the standouts, and they do not tire easily. The rest very enjoyable but don't quite have the staying power. My disappointment is that there are only two dance songs, and those are the most enjoyable. Since Usher is such a great dancer, I wonder why his album is overwhelmingly crooning, seems it would limit him in concerts."
5,I Still love this CD!,"Okay, Usher may be last year! but this CD never gets old, and that is why I love it so much! All his songs are about Love, but most of them are awesome dace toons also! i am one of ushers BIGGEST fans and i would not lie about this! Usher is great. If u liked the song Yeah! U should buy this CD because it is perfectly put together u can tell he put Work into this...A LOT!!My favorite songs are:Yeah!SuperStarConfessions part one & 2Throwbackand lot more!! I hope u take my advise. This CD is not just for Girls! k boyz? lol Thx"
1,Confessions By Usher,"Usher is THE! most overrated Singer in this entire industry, none of his songs are good, the only reason he gets all this publicity is because he is so called ""Sexy"" and he makes all these moms buy there 12 year old daughters an Usher CD..I bet you that 85% of the people that make up ushers fan base and cd sells are 10-18 year olds, and female....you wont see a 15 year old dude buying an usher cd, he would want like Ludacris or something, this guy is seriously overrated, and if you thing him saying Ooh uhh in high voices is singing then your sadly mistaken buddy, the only reason I like my boo is because of Alicia Keys, now that is some real talent right there, Alicia Keys should have sold way more albums than usher, I am not Hating on Usher, but I really thing he shouldn't get all the publicity he is getting, because he is not all that great"
1,Confessions of a womanizer,"Hey, I am not impressed by this album...it is no different from his previous albums....if anything I give props to Lil Jon for fixing the MESS...Usher in my opinion is very lucky....we'll see how he pans out against Mase....LOL"
1,Usher Usher Usher... where do we start...,"Well lets see. This guy sings annoying, slow paced R&B love songs that all sound the same, but with ""Yeah"" he decided to experiment a bit. Not only did he created the most overrated, overplayed, and annoying song of the year thus far, but he collaborated with the most generic rappers out there right now, Ludacris and Lil Jon. It only gets worse with Burn, hope you don't slit your wrists while listening to this song, because its boring, VERY boring. Don't buy this, buy some Blink-182."
1,One Of The Worst Albums You Could Imagine,"I hate music comming out now because all it talks about is sex, money, and a girl's body. This album is a perfect example. I believe that the world should go back to rock. I personally thought this album was horrific. This is just a pathetic and revolting CD. Take my advice and never by this ever."
1,Usher is not the spilling out all his confessions!!!!!!!,"This album[...]. ""Yeah"" was so hyped this should have been a disater. Usher sings so [...]. I mean when he goes in that high voice he has. And that is one of his confeessions I've have just said. The only songs I really like are"" Burn""""Simple Things""""Thats what it's made for?"""" can you handle it""the rest is just wack. do not call yourself the best R&B; artist ever. ya heard."
4,Cool,"This guy is a C-U-T-I-E! My favorite song on this album is ""My Boo"" I am a new Usher fan. I say this is a great album."
1,I have to confess this CD aint as hot as he is,"I always liked usher but this CD turned me off from his music, and his ever growing ego, but he sure is hot."
2,i dunno bout this...,"i think this album is very overrated!i like ""Burn"" but the others...i'm not 2 sure.""Yeah"" was good but it got overplayed!!!.the clip for ""Confessions""...yeah he is confessing...but is that a reason to start taking your top off?he is good artist, but i wasnt feeling this album."
4,His confessions are quite good,"Usher is all grown up now and he's letting listeners know on his hit-album Confessions. This R&B heartthrob has veered off the road of almost-teen pop to full hardcore R&B. Good job, great album!"
4,Usher is the man,This CD Is Da Bomb.Usher most definitely needshis props on this CD. It is better than Justin's.All the ballets and the uptempos are HOT.The are no bad songs on this CD.He sings about his life experiences.I give it 4 stars. Rated A-
2,NOTHING SPECIAL,"this cd was nothing special at all, how it sold as it did i donot know but i bet more than half the buyers thagut it sucked. Personally there 3 good songs on there 1 played out (yeah) alreday anothjer one on its way to being played out (confesions) and then cuaght up after that its all the same boreing nonsense. PLus we got burn, anyone who cant sing that song in thgeir sleep must not have a radio, its all we hear , tired of ushers crap. USHER you could do alot better, cuase thats what many expected alot better, i would never buy tis cd , so anyone intretsed in it askk a friend or sumthin dont waste your money."
4,2 GOOD 2 BE TRU,"I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD ALBUM....LIL JON HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THIS ALBUM CUZ IF IT WASNT FOR ""YEAH"" I DONT THINK THIS ALBUM WOULDA SOLD ANYTHING.""BURN"" IS A REALLY GOOD SONG BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY TOLD THE TRUTH SOMETHING A BLACK MAN KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT N THEY REALLY NEED TO TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM USHER!BUT GO BUY THIS CD FROM A STORE...LIKE PEPERMINT,CIRCUIT CITY,BEST BUY, F.Y.E,EARWAX....U GET THE PICTURE SOME REAL STORES NOT THEM PEOPLE THATS ON THE SIDE OF THE STREET!GIVE MY FOLK THE MONEY!!"
3,Trying to work his magic...,"Usher is undeniably the best male performer in the soul game right now, and every album her has had, he made better on the next...with CONFESSIONs he slows it down and takes us in....good? not necessarily, although the vocals are impressive and the lyrics are heartfelt, he tried too hard to swoon without using his orignal booty bass charm....the CD has a few amazing songs, (Burn, Yeah!, Throwback and Caught Up) but for the rest doesnt live up to 8701(granted that album was actually flawless) and doesnt catch me in. Overall Good Job Usher!!!"
5,A cd you can listen 2,"This is a good cd you can actually listen to it from track one till the the end of the cd and you wont get bored at first i hated usher but you gotta give him his props this is a real good chillin album I personally like yeah, confessions, burn, truth hurts, and that's what it's made for. If you dont have this cd you need to go get it"
4,Showing some maturity,"Usher is all grwon up and I'm loving it!!!! If I would have gone by some of the reviews written I would have passed on a good album. Usher really went into his soul for some of the lyrics for this album, and you can feel what he has gone through. The tracks I like on this album are the following:2. Yeah - my workout jam of course3. Throwback6. Burn7. Caught Up10. Truth Hurts11. Simple Things12. Bad Girl13. That's what it's made for14. Can you handle it16. Take your HandHe is as far as I'm concerned the King of R&B. So Bobby Brown, hand over your crown and give it to the true King!!!!!!"
2,Horrible,"This album is like 8701 all over again. If you want a great r&b album this album isn't it. Janet Jackson's new cd Damita Jo that comes out next week puts this cd to shame. It is much better, spend your money on that. I'm dissapointed i bought this record. I can't wait for Janet's cd next week becausei heard it and it's amazing."
3,Not as Good as the last two,"I was truly disappointed with this album. What happen to the collaborations? I thought collaborations were going to be done with Nelly, Brandy, and Stevie Wonder. For what ever reason that didn't happen. It’s also really hard to relate to this CD unless you have cheated on someone, or someone has cheated on you. Plus there are two tracks that due to recording quality have static on them. Burn is the Best song on this album. I admit his vocals are a lot better but that doesn't mean anything if your not going to have hot beats, and hardly any collaboration. I'm sorry Usher but you have done so much better."
3,I don't understand,"What the big deal is about this CD? It's a nice CD but not EXCELLENT i think 8701 is better. There are too many balladas and Usher is good at the fast tracks. Most the tracks are listenable but there's nothing special about them...they're kinda boring. If you're looking for the best songs, download these:YeahThrowbackBurnConfessionsCaught UpTake Your Hand"
2,Wonder what his next singles will be??,"This album is full of fillers, the only thing exciting is the damn booklet.If ya want a good album then pick up Janet Jackson ""Damita Jo"", you can listen from beginning to end on that album and she has plenty of potential singles than the one she chose."
1,So who buys this stuff?,I guess inner-city kids and young white teenage girls.Confession?? Didn't we have this sound with Boyz II Men . Maybe the little formula works!So buy it so you can brag that you have the album that swept all of the Grammy's and AMA awards.** BORING **
1,Oh My GAH!,"This is like the fifth 1 star review I do today, I ran out of good records to review.Usher is just a poser that women and guys like to believe they are ""listening to the best music right now."" He has only got a pretty face and muscles, and he loves to be without a shirt. Hmm, I wonder why his greatest hit has 2 other guys singing it. And Confessions plain SUCKS."
4,I Said- Yeah!,"My favorite song of all time is -Yeah!- Gangsta rapper Ludacris puts in some explicit lyrics, though. I think some of these songs stink, including the explicit songs- Do It To Me and Bad Girl- I can't understand why a R&B singer would sell over a million albums, while most people like Gangsta rap. Usher Raymond is my favorite singer- and always will be. Usher has became super famous from this album. I really think this album could have used 3 more hip-hop songs. I like -Truth Hurts- as my favorite R&B song. The confessional ballad- Burn- has been #1 on the charts for three months, following with #2 -Confessions part 2- and #3- Yeah!- I will tell yous a secret: When the smash hit -Yeah!- was released on the radio, it became #1 on the charts. That is what made this album sell so many (over 1 million!!!) Usher relly kicks a** with this album. I only have three more words to tell Usher and his fans - TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!"
2,YEAH PIMP LIKE,"I IS PIMPIN AL ""DAMN"". YEAH PIMP. FU PIMP. LIL' JON PIMP. LUDA PIMP. WILLIAM HUNGEE PIMP. WILLIAM TURN EL ROJO SOON. WE PIMP. I GIVE 2 FOR YEAH."
1,Hated It,This won't be on a 500 greatest albums of all time list. But since there have been no other essential releases lately it has no choice but to be #1.
1,My Lord...isn't Usher ever gonna shut up?,"I dream of a day when rap will be abolished. I also dream of a day when Usher will be forgotten. But I guess that will never happen. Usher is so annoying...I hate Yeah and am getting quite tired of it myself. And Usher is not a poet. Bob Dylan is a poet, but he doesn't like the word. Paul McCartney is a poet. John Lennon was a poet...Rest in peace, man. Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson are/were poets. James Brown, to a certain extent, is a poet. Usher is doomed to fade away. In fifty years, who do you think will be remembered? The Beatles, or Usher? I'll give you a hint--35 years after their breakup, and 25 years after Lennon's all-too-early demise, the Beatles still have a large teen following (myself included). So forget Usher. If you want to hear a good soul singer, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder all qualify. Usher simply doesn't."
1,seen it all before been there done that,"what usher is doing right now is no different from what michael jackson has done already with the dancing, singing and clothing styles usher is doing. Usher has already been there done that too, I liked his music until he released this crappy album. He's talented but anything but original. I wish you little girls would stop acting like he's some sex god and realize that he's just a poser copying what's been done already before and better."
1,Pure album fillers!!!!,"No potential singles other than ""Throwback"", ""Burn"", and ""Yeah"". What the hell is he confessing on this album...... NOTHING. All he keeps singing about is his relationship w/ Chilli, what a publicity stunt.This album sounds like it was composed at the last minute and released the next day. Pick up Ms. Jackson's new album ""Damita Jo"", this album deserves the number 1 spot."
4,Confessions Part III,"I had to get the Special Edition because I am an Usher supporter plus I'm loving ""My Boo"" that features Alicia Keys. Seduction is a cute song that obviously didn't make the cut but got added onto the special addition as well as Red Light. Overall Usher is doing his thing for 2004 and upcoming 2005 so why not re-release his best selling album to date with extra songs."
3,More mature Usher,"Album #4 is titled ""Confessions"" as it finds Mr Raymond confessing to infidelity and being human generally. It also shows how much Usher's vocals have matured over the years. He even does some great falsetto on the retro-sounding upbeat 'Take your hand', complete with vinyl-type scratches, where he sounds like Michael Jackson on the chorus.Not as great as '8701' but there are some standouts like the intense ballad 'Burn' (currently burning up the charts), 'Throwback', the simmering 'Can u handle it' (co-written and produced by Robin Thicke, and very passionately performed), 'Bad girl' and the upbeat 'Truth hurts'.'Yeah' is ok. I hated it when I first heard it but it is different and grows on you; Being #1 for months has that effect on you. :-)There are one too many same-sounding ballads and nothing musically ground breaking but still, a good effort from Usher. 3 and a half stars actually."
2,Only 4 New Tracks!?,This album ain't so special. There's alotta other song missing. I'd only buy this album if they got the songs:1. Confessions Part 1 (Better than Part 2)2. Sweet Lies (I think produced by the Neptunes)3. Yeah (Remix) - w/Missy Elliott (I heard this One Online)4. Dot.Com5. Whatever I Want6. My Boo Part 2 - w/Beyonce (She sings the verse better than Alicia)7. Red Light8. SeductionI have these songs but the quality is poor. I'd really buy this album if it had those songs in good quality... BUT 2 bad
5,I like this cd,"My favorite cd is R&B;, and is entitled ""Confessions"". The artist of this cd is Usher. Usher is a guy that everyone loves. It may be because of his looks, body, or songs. I like Usher for his songs. His cd has been played in my stereo almost five times a week.I like this cd because you can play it all the way through, and like all the songs. Confessions is a good cd to listen to, no matter what kind of mood you have. I say this, because the cd contains songs that deal with love, relationships,break-ups, infidelity, and partying. The cd has all types of sounds to it. There are plenty of songs on this cd that will get the party started, and there are some that might make you think about the relationship that you are in or just getting out of.I have a lot of favorite songs on this cd. The one I like the most is Track #13 ""That's What It's Made For"". This song is fun and it has a real nice beat. I recommend that anyone who does not have this cd, go out and get it."
2,2 Stars,"Excellent Tracks:T3,T6,T13Very Good Tracks:T2Good Tracks:~~~Meh Tracks:~~~Bad Tracks:T7,T9,T10,T11Horrible Tracks:T12,T14,T15,T16,T17*!*-Interludes,Introductions,Bridges and Skits not ratedCurrent single:Confessions Part 2"
2,not all its cut out to be...,"when this album came out i was really excited to go out and buy it... i had heard it was great, and hearing ""yeah"", and ""burn"" on the radio made it sound even more appealing.... but it is not all that good.... a few good tracks but that is pretty much it!"
4,stars break up to make up in a song,"time healed his wounds with these wonderful songsat first his lyrics kind of seemed ameture(sc)but now its deep soulful and it brings out his voice! this cd is great especially his song ""confession pt2""this cd is great and i suggest it"
3,Not bad,"Don't understand the review from A Music Fan in the USA who said the album was horrible. So why give it 4 stars? This may not be the best album but it certainly sounds like a step up. It's not Mozart, but it's good listening."
4,Possible Usher Fan....,"Ok, let me just say that I have never been a huge fan of Usher, and I still am not the President of his fan club. However, I decided to get this cd just for the heck of it-I had to know what all the hype was about. The first time I listened to it, I wasn't paying much attention to it at all. However, as I listened to it a second time, I gained a new respect for Usher. I think he has grown as an artist and entertainer, and he has a bright future ahead of him. I am not sure how I feel about him putting the details of the relationship out in the open the way he did, but whatever-that's between him and his ex. Anyway, it's a real good effort from Usher. I am looking forward to hearing more of his music-perhaps we will get even better songs from him once he is out of this ""breakup music"" phase of his life."
3,"Good, but not as great as they said it was!","I won't deny it, I was---still, singing along with most of his songs; his hits at least such as ""yeah"" and such. Everyone I know, friends, the media, all got me excited to listen to this album and then....I did.Now it's good but not as great as they said it was! It's the same disipointment as in hearing Beyonce's CD. Well, no, NOT that bad, but close enough.I'm not putting Usher down, just the stupid reviewers. They can go ahead, say it's good, but don't say it's great because these things are going to happen! Of course, if you're a true fan, like it, love it, what I say shouldn't matter. Just remember to those who are new to it, don't get your hopes up."
1,Let this CD burn..literally.,"People like Usher disapoint me, in that in certain lyrics they can be Mr.Wonderful, and in others they can be a total pig. Whoever thinks Usher actually MEANS any of the romatic things he says is quite foolish.This album is another fine example of what's wrong with out music industry. Don't even consider buying it. The lyrics are bad, the vocalss are bad, and he doesn't need the money."
2,Let me tell you why!!,"I gave usher 2 stars because he has earned it. he is a great artist, though he loves him too much. Usher you don't have to rip off ur shirt every time to get a response, just sing from the heart, cause you are boring me.I mean you can dance and sing, but you are missing something...depth. Usher please look at some old videos off Teddy Pendergrass, Al Green, James Brown, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gay, Luther Vandross, they never neeeded to strip to sell billions and neither do you. Sell sex, but show people that you are more than a Dildo!!!"
4,Ushers CD is the bomb,"The first time that I listened to Usher's new cd, i thought it was awesome. He is one that can be famous but still keep his family and friends first in his life. He is one of the only singers that has his priorities in line. I loved his new CD. It is worth every cent that you spend on it.Buy it before they run out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,'Kinda Disapointing After A 2 Year Break',"Ushers albums has been a huge hit here & in the USA but id like 2 know why. I have the album, and the only good songs are 'Yeah' (if u havent heard this song u have been living in a hole 4 the past few months), confessions pt. II (the new single), caught up, & bad girl. His 2nd albums is better & this is disapointing - we xpect betta next time, usher! he could also at least write his own stuff... Dont buy this rubbish! (even though i must admit he has a gr8 voice)"
3,3 STARS FOR 3 HITS.,"cd overall sucked. waste of 19$...only good songs are the ones he released. Burn, Yeah and Confessions part 2. Other then that the rest of the album is a waste and not worth buying. better luck next time usher when you make another come back *rolls eyes*"
1,RnB is DISGUSTING,"This album SUCKS! This is one of those ""MTV"" albums that turns disposable every 2 to 3 weeks. Usher is heavily overrated.Highlight: The Grammy Commitee can slack off because the posterboy of male RNB just released this album. They will pick him even if there are a million other better singers. He just fits the picture even though he sucks."
1,save me from all that is Usher!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OMG, what has the music industry wroght on themselves???? They only have themselves to blame....way too much R & B, Hip Hop crap on the airwaves...way too much. I await its fade into the sunset like the Diso era, Folk era, and Techno pop era. I await the return of great lyrics by master song writers, songs that use good grammer,poetry, and proper English! The more The Powers That Be annoit as ""genious"" midiocre talent, the more I stay away from CD purchasing and radio listening."
1,Flusher~ Constipations,"Usher, oh well I prefer Flusher, has never done much for me. Unfortunately he has to my art teacher. Upon purchasing this CD she brought it to school and the guys in my art class found it. They put it in the CD player which we are allowed to listen to in art class. So of course, I am forced to listen to this album over and over and over again. I was hoping for some guitar solos and screaming vocals but all I got were a bunch of dance beats and mumbling. 'Yeah!' is an extremely lame and cheesy song, much like all of its fans. Flusher sings about 'in da club with mah homiez/tryin to keep it down on da low key' and then he says 'she looked at me and said baby let's go/so I said yeah!' Urgh.. so much cheese it'll make you lactose intolerent from one listen. It will make you constipated. Thus, it is called constipations. I wonder what other sewage will come along this year. Good thing I unplugged TRL and local teen radio."
1,The WORST cd ever,"Ushers new cd sucks ass! The song Yeah, which is one of the worst songs ever, sucks just as bad as the album. RnB Sucks! Hip-hop sucks! Rap sucks! You cant even understand em!"
2,sucks,this album sucked. out of all all of his albums ive heard he has went downhill. i give this cd 2 stars because there is only 2 good tracks on this cd.
1,who cares if chili left you.,"stupid song, stupid artist, this cures my insomnia really usher dares to claim to make musicv in the mold of marvin gaye, and donny hathaway jive turkey better take notes and go to the school of funk not lil jon's school of crunk."
2,WHAT IS THIS?,This ablum I can berely find a song that is good that wasn't a single. Yeah his singles are great but the whole album? No he doesn't even have Connfesion Part 1 and he making everyone buy that new album for only 4 more songs! Usher before releasing an album make sure all the songs are on it and stop taking our money! Yeah he has a nice voice and he can dance that is about all he has going for him.. Unless he starts writing better SONGS! and making the album overall good not just his singles.
4,Amazing!,"I really loved this album. It's excellent. I didn't buy the special edition of Confessions, but I went to walmart.com and bought the four singles and D/L them for like 88 cents a piece. The album is awesome! Usher's voice is amazing. However, I didn't give it five stars because he doesn't write that many songs on here. I hope he does a duet with Amerie on his next album. Go and get it!"
2,"good, if you like repititious rap music","i'm an open guy. i usually like anything on the radio, but this album astonishes me. i LOVE how these rap/r&b people could get away with a song with 3 notes in in repeated OVER AND OVER again. Thats not a song. thats 3 of the most annoying notes repeated over and over again untill you could go insane. then, theres talking over it. thats not music. listen to bethoven or some of the clasic rock out there. its better than this stuff. so, if you are a person looking for creativity, look elsewhere, because with an album like this, you will just be getting the same old rap songs with a few notes that are catchy for awhile, but then grow more annoying and annoying and annoying. but i guess if you're into that kind of stuff, this might be your holy grail. (eh, but i do respect him for his dancing. hes like michael jackson. amazing...)"
5,great,the confessions special edition cd from usher was great. with songs that isn't on the original confessions cd. so if you a usher cd thats as hot as his other ones get this cd.
5,The new face (voice) of R & B MUSIC,"OK, two million buyers, my sister, my brother, my niece, my students, and my fellow reviewers can't be wrong; Usher is, without a doubt, the heir apparent to the throne abandoned by the self-proclaimed KING OF POP.""Confession"" is a tight set of tracks that I must admit grew on me. From the infectious bounce of ""Yeah!"" to the honesty of the title track and others, the young man is deserving of the praise heaped upon him by so many.The R & B torch has been passed and Usher is carrying it proudly.Long may your flame burn brightly!"
2,Usher Bares His Soul,"Usher is a great talent and will be around for a while. However, this is not his greatest CD. Aside from the super smash hit ""Yeah,"" there are not really any stand-out tracks on this album."
3,I Need More,"Well, i love Usher and his songs, but yeah and burn and like 3 other tracks are really good. and the album isnt bad, however i was expecting more. Not to say that buying the album is a waste of time and money, but let's just say that 8701, his last album, was waaaaaaay better."
5,"This CD does ""Do It To Me"" and yes, credit is due here...","Usher has done it once again. Although ""Yeah"" is a fun song, its definatley not one of the best. In fact before I heard ""Burn"" I wasn't going to buy this CD--maybe just burn it or barrow it. Making that song a hit first took away from the rest of the songs. My favorite songs are:""Confessions""""Burn""""Throwback""""Superstar""""Can U Handle It""""Do It To Me""""Follow Me""""Truth Hurts""""That's What It's Made For""The rest of the songs are good but not as good as these. I think he slacked a little on ""Caught Up"", ""Take Your Hand"" and ""Bad Girl"" but I still love this CD. He's not just talking about sex and drugs like a lot of CDs are--this is a great CD. In ""Confessions"" he sings about things a lot of guys are goin through.""Burn"" is a song that really makes me think. It reminds me in a situation that I'm in rite now.""Superstar"" represents everything I feel for a certain someone.The whole CD is good overall. Most of the lyrics I can relate to."
3,Should have put the neptunes on this cd,"Usher's Cd Confessions is a good cd, however his whole cd is made up of slow songs. I wish he would have made more club songs like ""Yeah"". There are too many slow songs. Those songs are good however, I was expecting to hear some neptunes produced tracks on Confessions. I want more songs from the neptunes and Usher like, ""U don't have to call"" and ""I Don't Know"". C'mon Usher make more uptempo songs."
5,Confessions,"Usher is a great artist. This CD is great. Yeah,Confessions Pt.1 & 2,Burn,My Boo,Caught Up...all great songs. This CD is great from start to finish. The last track could have done without Shyne's verse but otherwise this CD is perfection!"
1,rediculous!,"its rediculous how an abulm 3 years old is still popular! besides the only reason why he realesed this ""special edition"" album is just another way to get more money."
3,Too Bad He doesn't sound this Good live !,"This album is cool. As one of the previous reviewers siad , he explores his voice on this album and it SOUNDS GREAT. BUT alot of the lyrics lack substance... as a person who is trying to better my life, Usher's songs aren't the best for me, unless I want to be impowered sexually...and i don't. The song ""Thats what its made for"", when it starts he says he wants to tell a story... what he forgot is that there is a moral/lesson to every story.. and there is not one in the song... to me he's promoting unprotected sex. He needs to slow down, stop claimin to be a ""sex-a-holic"", before something REAL cathes up with him. But again his vocal abilities are great on the album..i'm still waiting for him to sound this good outside of the studio though..."
5,An Awsome Buy,"This album put Usher on top of the world! His previous album 8701 was really good put this is even better and more exciting with new beats and all new songs. With this album you'll sure to be the star of the High School party with great songs and the three that put him on top ""Yeah"" ""Burn"" and ""Confessions pt. 2"" you'll be rockin all night long."
2,4 MILLION SALES WITH A SO SO ALBUM!!!!,"this album confessions is not all that impressive. I expected much better material From an album that sold 4 million copies within a couple of months. I do give him credit for the song ""Bad Girl"" at least he thought outside the box with this one. It's a well put together original song & in my opinion the only other single on this album. ""Simple Things"" isn't bad but It's gets boring after awhile just like most of the songs on this album. Final thoughts: pick up the CD and judge for yours"
2,another Average Album from Usher,His voice is only slightly better than the last time out.the Material here is a dime a dozen save for a couple of cuts.He is all hype&little substance.He is More closer to Being a Poor Man's Bobby Brown than even daring being Considered another Michael Jackson.
2,OVERRATED,"I looked forward to this CD after 8701.Disappointment.Though Usher's voice is still as smooth and sweet as ice-cream, the material, particularly the ballads, are yawn-inducing bores. The only songs that shined were TAKE YOUR HAND and FOLLOW ME, the last two songs on the CD. It's a drag to buy and listen through a whole album to find two good songs. In addition, I found Usher, both the persona or that actual artist, quite unlikable. The song CONFESSIONS begin with his assertion of being a man and confessing that he cheated on his partner; I don't think a ""real"" man, a man of integrity, would have cheated in the first place! Too, Usher thanks God in his liner notes, claiming ""My creativity, my drive and abilities are unmatched."" That lack of humility turned me off, big time.Obviously there are many others that disagree based on the sales of this, but I would highly recommend that someone preview it before buying."
4,this is hot,i dont like r&b but this dude can sing i wont take anything away from him. this cd is fire and i recomend it whether u like r&b or not.
4,Good not excellent...,"Usher is a good CD I think he has grown up in terms of his music style but he is also just still Usher. And by saying he is just Usher I mean he is highly over played and over-rated. This CD is good and has some great songs on it but it is not special in anyway. I actually had to listen to the other songs that were not singles a few times to even really like them. I was hoping Usher was going to go more of the club route when I first heard ""Yeah"", but most of the songs are slow ballads and not real danceable. I usually listen to this CD when I want slow music or just to go to sleep. It is good but not excellent as it is deemed."
5,Just Hatin,"I only got one thing to say: Whoeva don't like Usher ya'll is just hatin! Usher got it all! Ya'll just hatin cause you ain't got money, abs, girls, or talent like he do!"
5,Can it get any better,"Usher really out does himself in this one. Yeah, Confessions 1 and 2, and all the rest. CD's that have good songs one after another are hard to come by. But you've come by this one. For me I had to give all the songs a chance and some songs a BIG chance, but after you hear them 3 or 4 times, they grow on you and you find yourself striving to know each and every word of every songs. It's a great CD!!"
2,Usher,If he could watch his language and sing about something other than sex he would be a great artist. I wouldn't recommend this but I will say he offered clean versions of his songs on the album.
5,Great album,"All the songs on this album, great, most especially ""Superstar"" my favourite. Usher is a great rnb singer and this album is easy to fall in love with I'll definitely recommend this anyone."
1,Attention : This cd is ALL HYPE!!,"I am an Usher fan but I need to speak the truth.This album is all HYPE!! Trust me, you are better off just burning ""Yeah"" & ""Burn"" on a mix cd.Pure album fillers...IMO."
1,Very disappointing...,"Ok now I heard the single ""Yeah!"" and it drew me into wanting to get this album. But I heard the whole album on an AOL stream and the album wasn't what I was expecting. I thought this album was basically garbage. It could have been so much better then what it is. There were only like 4 songs that were good or have the potential to be singles. These songs are Yeah, Burn, Throwback, and Caught Up. This album was in my opinion horrible. It was his worst album. If you want a good r-n-b album, be sure to pick up Janet Jackson's ""Damita Jo."" That was a wayyy better album album and deserves to have the #1 top spot on the Billboard chart that this cd has."
2,2 1/2 stars,"i've been an usher fan ever since he came out with 'u make me wanna' and i think he's very talented.but it's 2004 now... i was expecting him to be more grown up and be more involved with the musical side like production and all of that by now. this album is all about good melodies and great instrumentals but that doesn't say much about usher. it says more about the producers on the album which is why i think timberlake's album is slightly better. you don't hear anything new here to consider this as one of the best r&b albums in history... it's sad to see him so cocky because this album's overrateddon't get me wrong, there are some good tracks like ""throwback"" and ""sweet lies"". but it seems like usher's a little desperate when he has to sing about the contents of his diary (""confessions""). i give him points for being personal but it feels like he's forcing us onto some hollywood type controversy... which shouldn't have been included because he's very talented."
1,usher sux,"hello..as you can tell im not an usher fan..hehe..anyways..well the cd is a piece of garbage that i through out today,...dont buy it! it is not worth the money..if you love the songs yeah, burn and confessions part 2, just download them off the net (kazaa) all the other songs suck and borrowing from a friend or downloading off the net will save you some dollars.."
3,Feels Rushed,"although he did have a lot of time to do this cd, it feels rushed.. it has its moments. The title track being the best. Yeah, and Burn the only other two standouts. the other songs feel like filler. i think if he worked on some of the lyrics of the other songs more, it wouldve been really good.. for example.. superstar.. it had all this potential, but the lyrics fell short. im not sayin the other songs are bad, they just dont aren't great.good:burn, confessions, yeahhad potential:superstar, caught up, throwback,can u handle itbad:most othersreally bad:that's what it's made for (it feels cheap)"
1,I'm Like...,"Oh my gosh, why is everyone so wrapped up in this guy? He is sooo weak musically. I cannot believe all the hype(and I do mean hype) surrounding this dude. He deserves like 10 wiggedy's and 10 whacks. I am too through."
1,"Oh My God, Usher sucks!","I can't believe people like this crap. Usher is the most annoying, money hungry bas**rd of the century. All of his songs sound almost identical, and his voice is so whinny and irritating. I would never waste my precious dollars on his concerts, or his albums for that matter. Usher, someday you will be forgotten just like those other losers before you, so enjoy what you have now because it can only last so long."
2,Confesions sucks.,"Mr Usher Raymond whines too much. Throughout the whole album all he does is cry to his girlfriend. Please. He still has a whole lot of growing up to do, the big baby."
1,Boring Confessions,"Usher Raymond's confessions are boring. The standout track on the CD is ""Yeah!"". Usher should have collaborated more with Lil Jon and Ludacris. Although the song has been a mainstay at radio, it gets better with each listen. Radio is also jumping on board with the down tempo tracks, ""Burn"" and ""Confessions"". Both of these songs are languid ballads that have nothing new to offer. Speaking of nothing new, the track ""Do It To Me"" borrows the music from Prince's 'Purple Rain' song ""Beautiful Ones"", but there is no Prince writing credit on the song. Since Mariah Carey covered ""Beautiful Ones"" a fews years ago, Usher should have come up with something more original. The entire CD needs an influx of orginality. The reason that ""Yeah"" was an instant hit is because it was something new and different from Mr. Raymond. Confessions rates one star for ""Yeah""."
1,Not his best...,"I have to be honest....this is not a great album. ""Yeah"" and ""Burn"" are the only two standout tracks here. He did a very smart thing by releasing these two right out of the box."
1,AGAIN AND AGAIN HE'S TRYIN TO BE MICHAEL JACKSON,"This record is pure average R&B music. Well marketed cos is simply just like the others, features nothin' new!.... YEAH is anoying, BURN sounds like all the USHER ballads, U GOT IT BAD part II, not original, CONFESSIONS, well U REMIND ME part II, who is he tryin to kid, only cos he's Usher he pretend us to believe he well be forgiven?, MY BOO who ever say that this was the best track ever is so mistaken, only cos the blessed KEYS is feauture here, this song is repetitive, CAUGHT UP hum? Michael Jackson more a like one, this album is tryin' just to make people believe is the best, not not not worthy, the are so many other s you can buy like DIARY from KEYS wich is way better. Besides USHER truly should confess he think he's the cutest thing to walk on earth, at least that's what you can feel when you see him perform..."
1,Michael Jackson wannabe...,"Usher is nothing but a mix of MJ and James Brown in a bad way. He writes generic below average music and yets sells records thanks to the idiots at MTV that calls this overhyped album a classic. Please. Listen to ""What's Going On"" by Marvin Gaye or ""Songs in the Key of Life"" by stevie Wonder and tell who's writing real music and who's selling music with garbage lyrics. Usher is not original and alot of ppl think he is."
5,Adventure and Intelligence in one place!,"This book brought history alive for me. I first read it when I was in grammer school. I was caught in the adventure from the beginning, and later realized how much it taught about research, theories, and customs. The ideas can be applied to modern living. Why do we live the way we do? What happens when a change occurs in the environment, or in the culture? As exciting as Hatchet, with a historic view. If you ever get the chance, don't just read this book, buy it. I still have my copy, even though it is rather the worse for wear."
5,Fire-Hunter,"An extraordinary book. When I was a fourth grade teacher I readit to my class, who loved it. It has a story telling quality andis hard to put down when you start reading it. The story isunique in that it shows the beauty of discovering new ways ofdoing things -- inventing weapons to survive in an unforgivingenvironment. A creative and curious child will love the story.There's really nothing like it that I know of. Finally, theconcepts and vocabulary make it suited as a read aloud from fourth to sixth grade and as a good read for adults. Don't missout on an outstanding book."
3,Very good program but..............,This is a very good software but you need lots of time to get to use it.
2,Not to My Taste,"I didn't care for the sex scenes, nor the story line nor the ending. The ending was like a punch in the stomach andthen I wondered why I had even watched it."
5,EXCELLENT horror movie with AWESOME ending,"This is one of those movies that you catch on one of the cable stations late at night. Although I haven't seen it in years, I really, REALLY wish it would come to Blu-ray and DVD as suggested by many other reviewers/posters here at Amazon.Kelly Preston's acting skills are a bit ""overdone"" but nonetheless, she manages to pull it off whereas Tim Daly and Rich Rossovich both shine. Audra Lindley - Mrs Roper from Three's company, does an AWESOME job as Miranda's mother in the office scene where she starts pulling out her hair! And Anthony Crivello as Aldice is also very convincing in his job as a satanist.All and all, it was a VERY entertaining movie with a few corny parts tossed in for good measure, I presume. But definitely well worth the watch. The ending will shock and SCARE THE S&#T out of you!"
3,doesn't live up to hype,"The ""American Queen of Progressive and Symphonic Rock"" has a decent enough voice-- strong enough for metal, anyways. I would not classify this album as progressive rock, however; it is more heavy metal, more specifically 80s hair-band stuff. The musicianship is decent enough, but the material never rises above the ordinary, and even after several listens I find it a struggle to recall any of the songs."
1,Dissapointed,"make sure you review the final page before ok'ing your order. I hit the drop down list to order a black xl jacket. Apparently I must have done something between then and the final ok to end up with a bright orange jacket! I returned it for a full refund! In trying to return my order, it took over 3 days to get a response from the company. Apparently the business is run out of someone's house. Not very professional results!"
2,Does less than you hoped for,"Instant Deck design is very basic but difficult to learn. Not at all what I expected for a supposedly user-friendly software. No manual, so you have to read directions from disk (and too many pages to print if you go that route). I tried using the Deck Design Wizard, which does well except I didn't see a construction plan with dimensions, just a nice drawing of the finished project. Worst of all, I can't get the program to give me a material list. I'll have to play with this program some more, but as of now, it is worthless to me."
1,Not for anything but basics,This product will give you the basic layout only. Trying to put a stairway on a beveled corner just didn't happen. Also if you went outside the set perameters it would refuse to do anything. You get what you pay for.
3,deck building,worked as advertised....but i needed more ....somewhat not user friendly i am not a computer wizz
1,Don't waste your money,This program has very basic output. If your trying to build your own deck and need a set of plans...this is not the program. You can go to bobvilla.com and use his deck designer online program that will give you more than this program does. It makes me sad that this company still takes peoples money for this program.
2,Way too simple.....,"Honestly, this book is an adequate collection of short stories which involve Indian Americans. Overall, for the non Indian it is a suffient surface exposure to our culture. However, for the Indian Americans, each story's plot may be too simple when comparing it to our own lives. This book did not deserve all of its hype."
1,reading it gave me maladies,Don't believe the hype. This was the WORST book I read in the past few years. Trite. Tedious. And completely unoriginal.
5,Great stories,"I liked every one of the stories in ""Interpreter of Maladies"". Well written.It's rare to find a collection of short stories where all of the stories are good."
3,Very impressive,"I just finished reading these very compelling short stories by Ms Lahiri, and I congratulate her for lovingly bringing disparate identities in literary focus. The characters are mindfully drawn and events carefully constructed. One criticism of her work is the stories she sets in India. The American language she uses, does not fit the culture, one of many examples being that ""padlock"" is never a term used in India, just locks. India did invent its own use of the English language."
4,Simple yet True,"I fail to understand all the accusations about the book being too simple, the characters not having too much depth and about it not being worth the hype. I think people have got so used to literature that is full of complex subtleties, that when they come across something so startlingly simple, they just cannot digest it. So what if it is simple? The fact is, that it is so amazingly true and that's what makes the book so beautiful. Each of the stories are poignant in their own way.Leave alone the Indians in America, but the problem of being without roots is universal- in so many different contexts. In that sense, I think the book is universal in its appeal.People around us are really that simple - the experiences that they undergo seemingly ordinary, yet that is what is real and thats what is really fascinating to read about."
4,Delightful stories,"Jhumpa Lahiri writes well, with a great economy of words, in a simple and direct manner. In a few pages, she is able to paint a few complete characters. Although she has a good knowledge of Calcutta and India for one who was brought up and lived all her life away from India, one or two things about India are not correct. The language of Orissa in not `Orissi' (Interpreter of Maladies) but `Oriya'---Orissi is a dance form of Orissa. It is `Mandeville Gardens' not `Mandeville Road' in Calcutta (This Blessed House)."
4,A Colorful Array of Tales,"I'm not usually one for short stories, but these nine tales revolving around East Indian Americans are so well written, they're not to be missed. The stories range in experience from a woman who has an affair with a married Indian man, a young couple who reveal their innermost secrets when the power in their building is shut off, and one of my favorites, of a young Indian man who comes to MIT to work and rents a room from an elderly woman. They're haunting, and sometimes surprising, but all are little gems."
2,Poetry without Depth,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I liked her narrative; her description of the setting is very detailed and maintains a poetic flow. You can practically visualize the scene. However, I felt the stories themselves could not stand up very well on their own. Mostly every story seemed to begin and end w/ the description of the setting. It was as if the stories themselves had no point; they were created to accomodate the setting. Most of her stories seemed to lack depth; but perhaps that was due to the way she portrayed her characters as being too superficial. I didnt like most of her characters, and I didnt find their actions justifiable. The author provided no depth to her characters. Just 2-dimensional figures. This was what disappointed me."
4,Interesting insights,Interesting insights into the lives of people with different cultural and familial values than the average American. I'm glad the last story was a bit more upbeat than the rest.
5,"A simple, elegant, satisfying read","Despite the segregation of the book into multiple separate stories, I think they make a beautifully unified collection. Although the stories center around Indian and Indian-American communities and culture, the themes explored are universal: love, loss, life and death.The book was easy to read, yet it was very satisfying and I couldn't stop turning the page. This is truly elegant story-telling that tugged at both my heart and my mind. ""Interpreter of Maladies"" was the first Jhumpa Lahiri book I read. It certainly won't be my last!"
5,Just Loved This Book - Read it !!!!!,"This must be about the best book I've read by a South Asian author in a long time. Jhumpa's intelligent, senistive, and crafty literary style capture the nuances of being asian in america - without an overload of sentimentality. The stories are well observed, nuanced, and extremely well paced. Jhumpa has a way of looking at things that is extremely realistic and often cold and calculated - but also sensitive. The stories tend to move you along a tapestry of thought - that only the best writing in any language weaves. Overall a really stunning debut - I cant wait for her first novel. On the negative side though - the stories set in the USA - specifically around Boston - are far more moving than those set in India - which are much more literary in flavor. Jhumpa writes best when she covers people closest to her - in this case Indians living in the USA.Like the reviewer in the New York Times - my overall reaction to the book was Wow !!!"
5,At long last.,"Like other readers commenting here, I was also blown away by her stories in the New Yorker. It is almost amazing that this book was worth the long wait as I had very high expections. It is difficult to comment without sounding trite, this book is that good. Stop what you are doing and buy it."
3,Interpreter of Monotony!,"I found this book a little on the dull side. Being grammatically well written did not make up for an undertone of blandness that echoed through the book's entirity. I did appreciate the sense of realism Jhumpa Lahiri brought to her writing, and for her first book, I think it is a masterpiece. But I sadly discovered that it was not one of those reading pleasures that would keep me up 'til all hours, wanting to finish just one more paragraph."
5,Excellent; perhaps not Pulitzer though,"I greatly enjoyed reading Ms. Lahiri's collected stories, having never been exposed to any in their original magazine locations. The stories were captivating, and at times imparted cultural bits of knowledge I had not known. At other times, they simply displayed people with raw human emotions and needs; people whose fates I was interested to discover.I still have ambivalent feelings on whether or not this deserved the Pulitzer prize, because at times I do sense a sort of ""predictability"" in the writing style and Ms. Lahiri's way of finishing each story with a bit of a ""punch"". However, none of this detracted from the enjoyment and I surely would commend to anyone who asked."
3,A mixed bag of Indian immigrant experience,"A nice collection of short stories documenting the experiences of Indian immigrants. I found the stories a mixed bag. My favorite was A Temporary Matter, probing a troubled couples' ability to be honest with one another and the value and destructive potential of total honesty. The title story, Interpreter of Maladies, talks about the responsibility of the interpreter (similar to that of the author) to accurately convey experiences to those who do not understand. Mrs. Sen's shows what comes of independence in trying to adjust to a new culture and The Third and Final Continent made me think of the points in life when you can look back and realize how truly full your life has been. Other than those, I unfortunately found the other stories overly bogged down in details until they became fairly forgettable."
3,5 Stars For Character Development but stories a mixed bag,"If you have an appreciation of well written characters, its hard to go past Lahiri's collections of short stories. This lady understands people, and brings then to life with style and skill. My only criticism is that a number of the stories were a little flat, despite the great character development. Some in the middle of the collection especially left me with a feeling of ""so what?"". But the collection its worth a read, because when her stories do hit a home run, they are simply wonderful. The first story represents everything that is great about writing, in my humble opinion."
5,Interpreter of Maladies,Author is an excellent writer. Her descriptions of characters and places are succinct and easily accessible to the reader. I recommend this book to all.
3,styleless and generic,"Her characters are Indian, but ignorant about India. This is not necessarily a flaw, but when not only the main characters (living in the U.S.), but natives to India speak using Americanized terms, it destroys the reality of the location. Distances described in miles, Indian foods described in english instead of using itallics and an overall stubborn outlook on life in India, pulled the book downhill for me."
4,Touching tale,"Loved this story. So well written and hard to put down. The reader will become steeped in the culture of India, and feel a connection with self."
2,Pulitzer Material?,"While I admit I am a short story novice, preferring novels, I have to say that I was very disappointed with Ms. Lahiri's freshman effort. The book wasn't bad, but i never felt the passion for the characters that I expected (save Mrs. Sen), and found the writing a bit simple. But a quick, decent read- and I expect great things to come from Lahiri."
2,"Ok, but nothing great.","I felt cheated after reading this collection of short stories. I fail to understand what all the hoopla is about. Lahiri's writing style is heavy handed, and the characters she creates are weirdly one dimensional. If you want to read something really gripping, try anything by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala or Bharati Mukherjee instead. Pass this over."
1,"Book is great, but CD awful!","This review is for the CD (audio) version of Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri. I actually liked the writing and stories, but the reader, Matilda Novak, was terrible for this work. She may be excellent for other books that need a perky and cheerful white woman, but it was a mistake to choose her for this book. It really ruins an otherwise good piece of writing.What made it especially difficult for me was that I had just listened to Lahiri's more recent work, Unaccustomed Earth, read by Sarita Choudhury & Ajay Naidu. Not only is Unaccustomed Earth an excellent collection of stories, but Choudhury & Naidu become the characters in these stories and significantly enhance the book. They are a perfect fit for Lahiri's stories. I was really impressed and was looking forward to more of the same in Interpreter of Maladies. Big disappointment!"
3,"very subtle yet soul touching, tender yet gnawingly haunting","The stories seem simple on the surface, but hauntingly touch deep within every immigrant's soul. Who has not felt lonely in a new country, a new culture and most importantly, in their relationship? Yet, it seems obvious that Shukumar and his wife can only communicate when lights are out. The darkness outside perhaps revealing darkness in their relationship. And the same darkness seems to bring some intimacy to their almost dying relationship. The still born child seems a blantant imagery of their unfruictified love. Shukumar's confession about holding the child, and the knowing the sex of the child seems to be the absolute breaking down of his wife's ego - a hidden yet powerful sense that she never spoke of. Very poignantly told, very haunting."
4,great book,love the multiculturalism. I have been reading quite a bit lately that observes life in cultures other than the US and this was great.
4,Stories from Indian Americans,This book contains short stories which explain the experiences of individuals from India who have come to America. They helped me to better understand the immigrant experience and the culture of India.
3,Short Stories on Indian diaspora,The various stories are well crafted but for some reason I could not get 'into' them. For some reason I could not engage with any of the characters. However the study of any people or culture in transition - in this case the Indian diaspora - is always interesting and one of the recurring themes is the clash of a strong Indian culture and Westernized or Americanized Indians. Very often this clash results in funny situations and misunderstandings.I would recommend it to those looking for an easy and quick read.
3,never again,"Perhaps it is not Ms. Lahiri's fault that I was expecting something more than the competent stories and details of ""Indianness,"" so touted by the New Yorker, whose fiction editor appears to be more interested in a writer as a photogenic young woman or hip young man than as an artist with a truly complex, mature cultural vision. My expectations as a reader came, once more, from my being stupid enough to be suckered, once more, by the highly corrupt publishing industry. Example: I now hazard a guess that Ms. Lahiri (whose editor also edits Best American Short Stories), will appear (surprise!) in the 1999 anthology. I'm not buying it. Never again!"
4,"So young, and yet so sensitive and talented.","I was astonished that a woman as young as Ms. Lahiri was able to write so eloquently and sensitively about people of such different ages and experiences. I see some readers question whether this book should have won the Pulitzer prize. I have no comment on that. I chose to read it not because of the prize but because there has been some interesting writing coming out of India lately and becasue as an American I am always intrigued by the clash and interaction of cultures. I may not have enjoyed all the stories equally, but three of them - The Third and Final Continent, Mrs. Sens, and Mr Pirzada Comes to Dinner - moved me deeply, to tears."
3,Underwhelming,"These short stories just aren't as good as pulitzer winning, new yorker published ones ought to be. They are well plotted and crafted, but if you are looking for an absolute literary star, look elsewhere."
4,INCREDIBLE..INTERESTING AND VERY TRUE,"THE BOOK IS REALLY GREAT! I FIND MYSELF ENGROSSED BY HER CHARACTERIZATIONS. SHE REALLY PUTS YOU RIGHT IN THE MIND OF HER CHARACTERS. SHE IS VERY PERCEPTIVE WITH AN ELEGANT STYLE OF WRITING THAT HAUNTS AND STAYS WITH YOU. A VERY GOOD BOOK FOR HER FIRST TIME. I LIKED IT BETTER THAN ""THE NAMESAKE"" WHICH IS SIMILAR. BUT THIS BOOK HAS MORE TO OFFER WITH VARYING CHARACTERS AND STYLE OF WRITING. THIS BOOK IS A KEEPER!!"
2,comatose,"My apologies to those that found this novel, a piece of art. Having roots in the sub-continent myself this book caught my attention almost immediatly. After finishing it in one stretch over the weekend I fail to find anything inspiring or particularily commendable about this book.In short, it is simply a series of monotonous accounts of various immigrants' dull and discontented lives in America that seem to drift aimlessly into a null........is the author telling us that immigrants in America though second generation are never at ease with their surroundings?"
4,Defining disorder!!!,"Mr. Kapasi defines disorder as his full time job!!! What happened to Bibi Haldar and Boori Ma?... or reading this novel might make some Indians remember those days of transition from Indian to American culture as the final story - ""The third and final continent"" does. Jhumpa Lahiri's ""Interperter of Maladies"" won the Pulitzer prize for 2000 proving that to be an award winning literary work, it does not have to be confusing and complex. Two thumbs up for simplicity winning... Being of an Indian descent settled in the US, I found this collage of short stories sometimes nostalgic, sometimes a bit too familiar. The characters came to life in her stories. One feels the emotions that they are going through as the story builds up. The ending of many of her stories left much to the imagination of the reader."
2,"Depressing, depressing, depressing.","Did I mention that this was relentlessly depressing? So little kindness, joy, or optimism to be found amongst all these characters. I would have given this one star, but for the author's ability to write well. I read all but the last story and couldn't continue. Sorry I spent the money; I could have just given myself paper-cuts for free."
4,so?,"I found these stories formulaic but quite good. There were touching scenes with the young couple talking about their lost son, and the Third and Final Continent was exceptional, in its sympathy. Much of the rest of the book I found a bit repulsing because it seemed like she was pulling things out, describing Boston in a way I found misinformed and dishonest, knowing she could get away with things. She can put together a story, incorporate elements into it that are common in NewYorker type stuff, nothing too difficult, nothing nearly honest enough. Not to say that it isn't good reading and that the stories are fluffy, they are not. They are well written, they just leave something to be desired, and I feel a bit like something false is thrown at me."
5,Lives up to the wonderful reviews and more!,"I have been reading through some of the previous reviews and I am amazed that there are people out there who could possible think that Jhumpa Lahiri does not write what is in her heart. These stories are alive with heartbreak, pain, and quiet joy. Her writing is not the type one reads, but absorbs. Her characters are so real I feel like I grew up with some of them myself, and I am also not South Asian. As for Jhumpa Lahiri trying to be ""hip"" by writing about South Asians, she is South Asian, and her collection of stories is obviously something which is extremely personal. I don't think that anybody who want to simply ""cash in"" would be able to creat such a beautiful collection."
4,Wonderful short stories,"What a charming book. Comprising of short stories, Jumpha Lahiri captures both the charming and not-so-charming aspects of Indian culture. I think what I liked most about these stories is that not all end in a predictable ""happy ending"" but all are thought provoking. A lovely read."
4,Spare and simple on the surface ...,"... complex and compelling below. I've savored these short stories over some days and find myself later, remembering some character, some setting, their measure returning with clarity and fondness. A lovely collection ..."
3,Good but not great,"This collection of stories does a fabulous job in describing and explaining many aspects of the Indian culture and how they are affected by living abroad. In that sense, it is a great accomplishment and learning experience. However, after I read many of the stories, particularly the most promising ones, I kept wishing for more-- more detail, more depth of emotion, more impact. She is the kind of writer who is capable of brilliant work but for some reason does not let herself commit deeper to the intensity of a story. Not enough risk taking, which yields a sometimes-bland collection."
4,An elegant collection,"Elegant short stories that reveal a complex world and characters' inner thoughts through simple, descriptive prose. Some of the stories, such as my favorite ('The Real Durwan'), engage our senses on multiple fronts, throwing us the reader headfirst into 1970s Calcutta and amidst its sights, sounds, scents, and sensory elements. While Jhumpa Lahiri's stories are detailed, enabling us to gain insights into a specific culture, the themes she addresses are masterful in their universality, and appeals to those of us interested in the mysteries - the poetry and the squawks - of the human condition."
5,One of the best written books I've read,"Regardless of whether you're interested in the subject matter or plot, the author's use of the English language is magnificent. Read this book"
2,Stories written by recipe,"I too wanted to love this book, and assumed I would, given the praise it has been given. I thought the first story, A Temporary Matter was excellent, but all the rest were predictable. I could anticipate what was going to happen before it did, giving me the odd feeling that I had somehow read these stories before. People talk about ""workshop stories"" and I have never been able to put my finger on what it is. I still have trouble defining what the problem is with this kind of story (and I graduated from a workshop myself) but now I realize that I know it when I read it. Perfectly fine stories, nicely written, but ultimately dull and uninspired, as if written from a recipe: add one conflict to one exotic setting, one case of infidelity, abuse, or angst, sprinkle with spare, clever writing and stir."
5,I hesitated...but I'm very glad that I did!,"My wife read this and recommended it to me, but I hesitated. I thought, What could a young, Indian girl possibly say that could interest me (a middle-aged white male)? Boy, I'm so glad I read this. Jhumpa Lahiri is one of the best contemporary writers that I've read. No matter who you are, this book will delight and teach you something about our cultures trying to survive together in this world. It's a great collection of stories."
3,"Good writing, but not a work of genius","Maybe I'm being picky, but with so much good modern fiction, I just didn't think this book was that special. The writing was excellent and many of the stories were engaging, but they began to feel a bit formulaic after awhile. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head by pointing out the similarity to writing workshop stories. I'd take T. Coraghessian Boyle any day over her although since the book is short I didn't feel sorry I read it. In this same genre, I thought the Pakistani Funny Boy was even more compelling."
4,A nice insight,"I enjoyed this collection of stories a lot. It did seem to have a constant theme of life in an arranged marriage running through it. It gives the reader a look into a culture that many people don't really know about. Though at times you'll wish that Lahiri addressed other issues, the book makes for an interesting and entertaining read."
3,Worth Reading,"Thoughtful writing. The last story was the most satisfying, though I did gain insight into Lahiri's culture from all of them. Not a big fan of short stories or writing for writing's sake, and prefer good story telling to creative writing. What is missing in some of the stories is a reason for the writing - the lack of plot feeling a bit too 'modern' or academic. Am anxious to see if Lahiri can sustain a storyline with Namesake."
4,Very good,"There is so much life in this small collection of stories - each one a flawless portrait of motion, of sadness - that it recalls something that could only be held in the vacuum of the soul. Only a pen personal and brave could turn these feelings into words on a page. These enjoyable tales will stay with you - in the waking hours and in dreams."
4,lovely collection of shorts,Interpreter of MaladiesGreat collection of shorts that seem interconnected and complete within themselves.
5,great book,"I never liked short stories, but this book caught my eye. It is broken up into several short stories each with a wonderful plot. Her book Namesake is also a must read."
5,Great book by a great writer.,"I read this book after reading The Namesake and found the two very simililar. However, I really enjoyed both books and highly recommend either."
3,Mixed,"Ms. Lahiri is clearly someone whose future work will be a pleasure to read. Some of her stories are masterpieces - as good as the best of William Trevor. But some, particularly the ones based in India, display elements of superficiality. I particularly disliked the title story, and one about an old woman who looked after an apartment building."
5,Amazing short stories,"Short stories are not my favorite, so I don't read many of them. This was my book club's selection for last month and I have to admit I was exceedingly skeptical. I am also happy to report, this debut author undeniably surprised me.These stories, without fail, are intensely moving. Each one gives a glimpse of a different foible. My favorite was the first story in the book ""A Temporary Matter"". This is a story of a married couple that at first glace seems to have drifted apart, but on closer inspection, have been wrenched apart. Can they come back together if they face their past?""When Mr.Pirzada Came to Dine"" made me wonder what children from different backgrounds face in American public schools. I suspect it is not at all pleasant since the things stressed in their homes are completely ignored in our schools.The other stories are equally compelling and thought provoking. If I could find more short stories like these, I would probably read more of them."
5,Heartbreaking when the stories end. You want more!,A great read. Each story was surprising in its wisdom and poignant observations of the ordinary. This book took me into people's hearts that I had never thought of and made me feel for them. Every sentence had a purpose and was so well executed--no wonder it won a Pulitzer. A wonderful choice for anyone who wants to expand their knowledge of other cultures and/or enjoys beautifully written prose.
4,short stoires with big messages,"Jhumpa is a wonder writter, I have enjoyed the last weeks researching her life on becomeing a pulizer prize author. Interpreter of maladies is a wonder book to read, some stories are slow going but other are very heart felt. Jhumpa describes the differece in culture beautifully, each story opens a new door to a life of a new character. I recommend this book to any student that is doing a book report, summer reading or doing reading as a past time. I recomend that you read the last chapter"" the third and final continent"" very slowy. I enjoyd this this short story the most."
4,firm and heartfelt,"The manner in which Jumpha Lahiri pens her nine tales is sure charming. All her characters are delineated in such a way that it makes every reader feel that the tale is set in the neighborhood. Her power of observation is astonishing, her choice of the subject is commendable; and most of all, her approach is firm and heartfelt and that's what makes the book excellent."
1,"Overrated simply because of its ""Indianness""","Overly simplistic, pointless and verging on Indian history 101. Read them and you come away saying ""What ?"" At best, they belong to the ""women's magazines"" of old, under their ""Story of the Week"" column. India is ""in"" for now. Such writers wouldn't get a second look if it weren't."
1,It Won A What?,"This is the kind of writing that should win only rejection letters from editors. Blah blah blah. It's all ""tell"" not ""show."" Anyone can tell a story -- the challenge is to attempt to dramatize it. This tendency -- as in Nathan Englander -- to merely tell the story is perhaps due to the reading public's desire (and hence publishers') for biographies. Whatever the cause of its being actually published, without its so-called exotic flavor, this book would to this date only be available on Ms Lahiri's hard drive."
1,As short in thought as it is in length,"How this sub-par piece of work won a Pulitzer is beyond me. If an award was given for these dull short stories, I guess I should get my acceptance speech ready for next year's Pulitzers after I win one for this review. No personality in this bland collection and nothing much about it to recommend."
5,An inspiring collection,"THis book is truly wonderful! A must read for any appreciator of Indian culture. Lahiri has the gift of capturing Indian as well as AMerican cultures, and the cross-cultural conflicts between the two. I draw personal inspiration from this fine collection of short stories."
4,[...],"The book is priceless. Stories felt strangely familiar, especially the ones that related to events in own life. Not all stories in the book were equally moving though, probably because her writing will seem ordinary to a reader who has not lived or experienced her book. Love her writings style.. book is inexpensive and reads quick. Suggestion, go for it."
4,What a first effort!,"I remember reading that this book had won the Pulitzer and being rather uninterested from the initial description. 200 pages later and I'm thinking this is one of the best short story collections I have ever read. Jhumpa Lahiri has written a beautiful collection of stories that take place in India and America. Her gift is to write weightless prose with a deceptively simple feel. Whether dealing with a young American woman's feelings toward her married Indian lover, the unexpected, sometimes unwanted, discoveries when newlyweds really get to know one another (unfolded in a clever analogy), or the title story about a tour guide's revelatory afternoon with an American family these tales amuse, enchant, and touch your heart. Brilliantly conceived from start to finish."
3,Maybe it's me...,"A friend of mine loaned me this book after her book club discussed it. She highly recommended it, and I was enthusiastic to read it.The title story, ""Interpreter of Maladies,"" is by far the best. The characters are well-drawn and the story compelling. The rest of the stories are uneven. Some will grab and hold your attention. Others will leave you slightly disappointed and maybe wishing there were more to them. More depth. More description. More direction. Just more.Lahiri is at her best when she relates Indian culture to the reader--discussing the sights, smells and customs of a magical country.This collection was not a ""wow"" for me like it was for some other reviewers. If you don't mind thoroughly enjoying one story then having a more tepid one follow it, then dive right in. There's enough here to keep you reading."
1,trite,"To superficially describe the ""atmosphere"" and ""everydayness"" of places and things is, shall we say, a mean feat. This book, like so many others claiming to depict (""represent"", even) ""the myriad experiences of Life"", shies away from anything resembling ambition. Which, of course, would be bad, because ""ordinary people"" - as portrayed by Ms. Lahiri - are sad, spineless, pathetic creatures who are too scared to explore anything, whether language or relationships in ways that might be unpleasant or make for out-of-body experiences. Ms. Lahiri seems to have invented an audience that is clearly stupid, joyless (think BIG joy) and lacking in originality. If the counter-argument is made that, in fact, people ARE pathetic, I can only ask whether the medium *must* so compulsively follow the message. ""The Interpreter of Maladies"" is a celebration of petty craftsmanship at best, and mediocrity at worst."
4,Entertaining and Emotional,"While I had to read this collection of short stories as a student pursuing a master's degree in English, I find myself going back to this collection long after school is over. The stories in this collection are beautifully written, witty, and always insightful in the way that they examine how difficult it can be for a culture to retain a sense of cultural heritage while still progressing forward in the modern world."
5,Wonderful,"I enjoyed each and every story in this collection. I am a great fan of so called ""slice of life"" stories and these stories were so eloquently written that you felt that you knew each character personally. I only spent a short time with each of them, but will remember them for a long time to come."
5,Great book,"Deserving of all the praise it has gotten, this work of short stories is an exciting & lyrical read."
5,Beautiful vision,"Each of Lahiri's stories are sincere, graceful and smart. Her characters are flawed in interesting and careful ways which allow the reader to embrace not only the persons but the struggles that present themselves to them. Her women are direct and intelligent, witty and clever. With her brilliant charaters who seem to sing their stories in your ear, Lahiri has bridged many gaps - gender, race, religion...bravo."
5,An enjoyable piece,"Jhumpa Lahiri has caught the immigrant life quite well. I know it, because I lived that life in the USA as I journeyed through my years as a graduate student to where I am today. The anonymous critics of Lahiri probably can't appreciate her wirting because they can't perhaps empathize with the characters or would not like to empathize.Lahiri has mastered the art of story telling. She has captured the characters well as presented them so well that I felt as if I was right there in her father's living room. Good job Jhumpa! When is your next book coming out?"
3,"Solid Lee, Cushing Film!!!",This is a film I had not seen until I ordered it from Amazon. It is not the best film by Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. but it is definitely not the worst.Nothing but the Night is more of an occult mystery story. Lee and Cushing are both involved in the investigation of several murders the story evolves from these killings. It has a solid premise and the two stars equate themselves quite well as always.I definetly recommend the movie for Hammer horror fans and fans of Lee and Cushing. I enjoyed the film and will be viewing it again in the near future.The transfer is good on this dvd and the sound was what one should expect from a film made in the 70's on a budget.The price is reasonable at under $15. Give it a try as it was Chris Lee's attempt to set up his own production company. The company may not have done any more movies but it did well with this one it is a good film.
5,Cushing and Lee together!,"Once again Cushing and Lee are two two the greatest actorsever but never get their credit! They belong in the samecatagory as Brando, Pacino, Deniro, Wayne etc.... This isnot the greatest movie but it's very good and they givetheir all as they do with any part! that's an actor!Like Karloff and Lugosi no part was too small! actorsdon't do that today nor can they act their way out ofa paper bag! A must for Cushing and Lee fans!"
4,confusing plot line,This film had a confusing plot line especially at the end. Lee and Cushing in straight roles (somewhat disappointing). Chubby Diana Dors past her prime in a dumb red wig.
4,Good review from a surprising place,"I was sitting in a tire repair shop awaiting bad news and reading Jamaica Kincaid's My Garden to while away the time. Suddenly, the young technician approached to tell me that things were not so bad after all - and better yet, he informed me that I was reading a GREAT book! Who would have thought to receive a recommendation on a gardening book from a kid with axle grease on his hands!He went on to explain that his teacher had assigned the book in his writing class at the local college, and he found it enchanting. (That wasn't his choice of words, but you get the drift.)And indeed, it was an enchanting read. From her poetic mastery of the English language, to her transplanted Caribbean viewpoint, Kincaid writes from a different place - and don't we read at least partly to hear a different voice? Touching softly upon some very strong political sensibilities, Kincaid makes you think about earth's garden of souls as well as plants."
5,A Gardening Reflection,"Gardening is one of the ""loves"" of my life, and the garden is where I do my serious thinking about another one of my great ""loves""-reading. This book is delicious!!! As Joseph Campbell said, ""Reading takes or opens doors to places that you've not yet traveled."" Ms. Kincaid pushed me in a direction so rewarding that I marvel at her ability to express so well man's relationship with and desire to garden. For those of you who couldn't see or get the big picture, I say read it again with an open mind. My reflections on her musings will keep me happily digging in the dirt for quite a while."
4,Gentle beautiful life-of-a-gardener book,"I liked it; I liked it very much. Contrary to the opinion of one of the other reviewers, it is not a showing off exercise for latin knowledge, and any self respecting gardener will empathise with thoughts of rabbit destruction when gazing upon the obliteration of a carefully planned and expensively nurtured border. I thought it was an enchanting read, particularly the descriptions of the visits to the Chelsea Flower show and Jamaica's reactions to the various eminent English garden luminaries encountered there! Maybe I am biased, but she likes the same plants I do, and I had the magical feeling of my own problems and loves materialising before my eyes on print. So there, to the grouch who only gave it one star! OK, so she doesn't have the extensive encyclopaedic knowledge of a plant biology PhD, but that would be missing the point. Most of us don't - we just like gardening, and gaining bits of knowledge as we go and grow. One of my current faves."
3,Blunt & Sassy---1 Green Thumb Up,"If only this collection of essays were as simple to classify as a genus of plants. The title is the first inkling of the idiosyncratic style of the Antigua-born author, who stakes her Garden prose with parentheses the way she might prop up a row of French Marmande tomatoes. In this case, happily, the yield is no less luscious.Although the book kicks off with a listless piece about wisteria (what was that all about?), persistent readers will be rewarded with smart-mouth observations on useless horticultural tools (she calls a trap for garden varmints a ""ridiculous pantywaist contraption"") and highhanded seed sellers. Sprinkled among these observations are intriguing autobiographical tidbits about Kincaid.The author only hints at what life is like for this particular black woman living in the mostly white state of Vermont. Nor does she even say precisely what her garden grows. But it sounds as if, Noah-like, she has planted a botanical zoo."
1,Not my kind of gardening book,"Parts of this book were fairly interesting, but the first chapter was awful. It took a while to get used to her writing style which is very disjointed and rambling. I found myself asking questions about her and her garden which were never addressed in the book. Allen Lacy is a much better gardener/philosopher/writer."
2,Tedious - Good Word,"I couldn't finish this book, and usually I finish books too quickly. The reviewer who described her book/writing style as tedious wins the prize from me. I think I would have liked her piece if she wrote differently. But..."
1,Garbage,"It's a joke. There is some information covered but it is not well organized. It's just some dork who wants to act like he's a heavy metal, devil worshipping, wanna be.The ""actor"" could have been a mannequin; he sat still on his ""throne"" with his stupid hood pulled down over his face and just talked."
4,Great.,"Master piece. Should hear ""Romeo's Heart"" at least as good as his well known hit ""Just when....."". Great CD of this ""hard-to-find"" songwritter and vocalist. If you liked ""Warmer"" is about the same level. Is because we all want still more, that is ranked 4 stars instead of 5.Strikingly poor marketing has this singer, worth of much more recognition. Future will tell, about this singer, hopefully soon."
3,Instructive,It was instructive but unfortunetly the internet is making things easier to find and to learn about it if you have further questions.
4,For Real Ferrante & Teicher Fans,"What makes this collection special is these tracks are all previously released but re-recorded here as solos. For those familar with the works of F&T, you get a whole new outlook on the actual piano playing that would often get drowned out by the orchestra. A genuine F&T fan will find this a great addition to their collection. My particular favorite from this CD is ""Send in the Clowns.""DO NOT BUY THIS CD if you are looking for the original performances of these works!"
2,One word only : deceived,"I did not read the reviews of David and Paticia before buying it, probably I would have purchased anyway just for curiosity. Well I must say they are perfectly right their few words say more than a poem.F&T; where have you gone?Luckely my memery is stronger than this CD (=Complete Disaster).I will go on searching for the wonderful F&T; I remember.Ciao,Franco"
4,I can top that concert story,"When I saw the line about a Ferrante and Teicher concert really being an event back when they didnt use a full orchestra, I had to tell you what happened to me many moons ago. F & T were part of the Miami University of Ohio concert series(This was long before Millett Hall opened, and all the big events were held at the much smaller Withrow Court. My grandfather ,who knew I was a fan decided that we could get our tickets at the door and didnt have to leave early,could grab a bite to eat on the way and get there in plenty of time.(Long before ticketmaster ,and I was not yet a graduate of Miami). Well suffice it to say, we got to the steps of Withrow and were told that they couldnt sell any more tickets! I dont think I spoke to him for a week! Am eagerly awaiting this CD, and any others that come around.I really miss their magical performances."
2,Ferrante & Teicher Collection,"These guys are really good, but the arrangements were just ""too busy"". There was just too much going on at one time. I would have liked more simplicity in the music; like just sticking more to the melody."
1,The Ferrante&Teicher Collection,Thier music just perfect.all their music are wonderful.I have so many of their albums.
4,THIS is the gemstone.,"Fans of the Moldy Peaches, you will not be disappointed but delighted at Adam's great solo effort. Who can help but love this guy? Our favorite stoner delivers a great bunch of chilled-out, comic gems. Opener ""Apples, I'm Home"" gives off a kind of wacky/silly vibe which seems to almost be a 'theme' for the rest of the album. ""Mozzarella Swastikas"" is hardly any tamer than the first few tracks. ""I'll be getting head, under the rainbow"" Green sings in his dazed voice. This type of lyric is definitely not unusual nor surprising as you'll find bizarre lyrics such as this throughout the entire album. Adam Green is CERTAINLY not for everyone; If you're into quirky folktarts or are just curious...check him out."
5,A Great Closing Album,"John's gift to the world of music under his RCA label came to a close with the release of this album- and sadly so. Here we find the seasoned songwriter and performer again on the top of his game. After releasing ""Dreamland Express"", an experimental album with a different feel than the ordinary Dever we all have come to love, John crafted ""One World"" to be among his finest. The album opens with ""Love is the Master"", an uplifting, upbeat, and most certain John Denver classic. As the album continues, we see the softer, honest John Denver in ""Love Again"", the open minded optimist in ""It's a Possibility"", the socially aware in ""Let Us Begin"" (watch out Mr. Dylan, John makes some brilliant moves with this strong dialogue between a world divided). This album showcases John's incredible scope as an artist, writer, and performer in the beauty, and grace you'd expect only from him. ""Flying for Me"" alone will give this album 5 stars... put it on your wish list you won't dissapointed!"
5,Wonderful renditions of visionnary songs,"""One World"" contains some of John Denver's most thought-provoking and tear-jerking songs; for those who like his ability to combine visionnary thoughts with catchy tunes should have it in their collection."
5,the place to start,"If you have no experience with spells or are just getting started, Easy Enchantments is the way to go. It is a fun read, a great gift, and an invariably effective tool. I can say with all honesty of someone who was highly skeptical to begin with that never has one of Lexa's spells failed for me. It's not all smoke and mirrors, these are practical applications to your daily life that are fun, useful, and start you on the path to getting in touch with nature and its forces. Enjoy!"
1,an insult to the craft,"ms. rosean's books are pop-culture witchcraft, of very shaky background and quality. i have met ms. rosean on several occasions, and she was rude and arrogant. that is not the image witches should be portraying as we reclaim our position as respectable members of society. for all those interested in learning about the craft, don't waste your money on this."
4,Great!,This book was so cool. It is fun for the whole family and w/ ur friends. You never no if the spells will come true or not. There are many kinds of diffrent spells you can experment w/ and in many diff. catigories like to look amazing. So Buy this book
1,Frivolous,"I picked this up because the author claimed to have translated old-time spells into more accessible ones, complete with ingredients that actually can be found in stores nowadays. I should've paid more attention to what the book's spells focus on, though. They're all so petty! A spell for a better wardrobe?? A spell to get a good parking spot?? Meanwhile, I wanted to find a spell to help someone I care about overcome an illness, and there's nothing in here about that. This book focuses on the trivial stuff. It feels as though it's geared toward those who fall for the promises made in late-night infomercials, not for people who seriously want guidance in using herbs, oils and positive thought to bring about change."
1,Do Not Buy,"This book should've been named Easy Enchantments/Compilation. This book is all three of Lexa's books put into one. It has a few new spells but, a majority is from her previous three books. This books is a waste of money and time. By the way, three books later I'm still waiting for one of her spells to work! Your better off going to a Botanica!"
1,Her Last Three Books Rolled Into One!,"Could she not think of anything else to come up with? Not the best book I have owned - a ""dust collector"" if you will. Lexa's introduction is great. I'm not skeptical when it comes to magick - but I question Lexa's spells. I question if they work.Where did she pull some of these spells out of? Certainly not her hat!"
1,Not as good as I had expected,The first enchantment describes how to polish your shoes. Its a bit of a good book if you want to send it to someone who really believes in witchcraft and you don't!
3,"Pretty good romance, but not a keeper","The romance in this book is hot in some stories and nonexistent in other stories. With such wonderful authors of lesbian fiction I was sure that this book would be a keeper. Instead I plan on giving this book away. While I don't regret reading it once, it's not worth to read twice."
5,A thoroughly Researched Biography,"Saul Alinsky was a very complex person, absolutely dedicated to to justice and compassion for everyone, especially those who were in a position to be taken advantage of. He is an inspiration for our time. The well-researched biography gracefully records all the aspects of Alinsky's life, to make a very good read."
5,Amazing Images,"Coming from an amatuer photographer and former journalist, I was not expecting much. However, Tipper Gore did not take the pictures, and instead she and her husband selected some photographs to show different families of all walks of life in different stages of existence. Some of the pictures you will have seen before, but most were new to me. It is a good addition to your living room table."
1,"Okay, but not great","While the Gore's have captured some nice pictures, I really can't justify the price of this book for what you get.There are other picture books available that are better and cost less."
1,I was hoping for more pictures of same sex couples,"I bought the book and was very disappointed. The review mentioned photos of same sex couples but their were only a few and no nudes. I hope I can get my money back.I do think Al and Tipper have a point that, in the future, more American families will look more like the Michael Jackson household. We will see more diversity with same sex parents, transgendered parents and interracial transgendered parents too. The future looks bright but it just did not come out in this book which is a real shame."
1,Disappointing but what I expected!!,"After the democratic convention, I concluded that the Gore's were two of the most boring, artificial people I have ever seen. This book and the other one as well are a reflection of the phoniness they exhibited on the stage with their adolescent embrace. Their books' contents are an obvious contneance of this plastic and artificiality. It's amazing how the two of them can contort themselves into gumby-like poses and writing posture. It's a sorry state when they are able to fool even one person.The book is replete with a litany of phony descriptions and attitudes. Will the real Gore--Al and his clone Tipster--please appear for all to see. I don't believe even they know who they are and it is reflected in the writing style apparent. I wouldn't be surprised if we are told it was ghost written!!"
4,Heavy Hitting,"Not as good as ""Gone Forever"" but still a great listen. Such songs as ""Chains of Humanity"", ""The End of the World"", and ""To The Fallen Hero"", really make this album great. Good melodic vocals as well.Go out and pick this up along with ""Gone Forever"" and ""Determination""."
