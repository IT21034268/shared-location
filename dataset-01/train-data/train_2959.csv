3,Films still on 2 discs?!?!!,This set would be five stars or even more if not for one thing....in the UK the content description (I can find) of the 15 discs specifies that the films are split over 2 blu-ray discs - WHY?? I was looking forward to not having to switch discs as obviously BDs can hold far larger amounts of data when compared to DVD. Does anyone know if this is correct? I really do hope the description is wrong and that each films is on one BD and not split over two.
4,"Great quality, but 2discs per movie is really disapointing",There is no doubt this is an awesome set. The pic and audio quality are outstanding. The only thing preventing me from a 5 star rating is the 2 discs per movie issue. It amazes me they couldn't fit the wholefil on one.
4,Great but wish the movie was on one disk,"The best quality of Lord of the rings extended edition movies. The bonus discs are still DVDs. I was hoping for less discs since blu-rays hold more but it isn't that big of a deal, the movies are long enough that a break is necessary and the bonus discs I'll only view a couple of times. I was just hoping that I could watch part of the movie, take a break, and start it up possibly the next day without having to put in another disc after only 20 minutes of viewing. The downloadable movies are a nice bonus though."
1,Part two on any of the three movies just won't play!,"My blu ray player is less than a year old, and up to date on all firmware. It plays part one of each movie just fine, but won't even start to play the second part. Most frustrating especially when you spend $70 on this set. Warner brothers is still garbage."
2,Dispaointed,"i dont know what New Line Was thinking when they released this version . For one 15 disc really , thats a waste of space . We are in the Blu Ray age , 6 discs for 3 movies come on . I wanted one movie on one disc , if all the appendices are on the bonus disc why waste all that space . Im going to stick with the dvd version of these movies till they can think straight ."
3,"first movie too dark / green, other 2 are awesome!","I give the first movie 1 star due to the green tint and it's much too dark. the other 2 movies transferred in stunning quality, five stars for them. Average 3 stars overall i guess.i was able to mitigate a bit for the green / dark by ripping the movie and watching it with ""QuickTime Player 7"" (note, not the new ""Player X""). The Player7 has A/V controls. I turned the brightness up a notch, the contrast up a notch, and the tint toward red (toward the left) a notch. That actually makes it look pretty okay. does not completely fix the darkness however, but now it is watchable.They really should re-remaster the first disc and send us all and updated disc or download."
4,Theatrical Included?,"I purchased the extended edition DVD box set about 6 years ago. I think it's fantastic (5 stars). I understand that this is the exact same product, but with the digital copies. While I'm sure the extended editions are superior, it's been so long since I've seen the theatrical editions I was hoping this product might include both, but also it doesn't.Does anything think this is coming? I.e. a signal blu-ray edition that ALSO includes the theatrical release? I don't want to buy both sets, and if I'm going to upgrade to blu-ray I'll do the extended edition again, but this seems like a bit of an oversight."
5,Best BluRay set available,I realize that this is the extended editions only. Big deal. The quality of the picture and sound is incredible. The Gandalf fireworks scene looks magical and the entire journey is more captivating than the first time I watched. By far the pride and joy of my collection
5,Best Blu-Rays of all time,"My wife and I just finished watching all 3 of the extended editions on blu-ray, and it was by far the best movie watching experience we've ever had. These movies, coupled with the incredible sound and picture quality, leave every other movie (and blu ray) longing. This is the pinnacle standard by which all blu-rays should be judged."
1,Green Goblin? Green Lantern? Green Hornet? No: LoTR: TFotR !!,"Too green. Too bad. I'll keep the EE DVD for the 1st one, thank you very much Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema, or whoever's responsible. Has to be a mistake somewhere ..."
2,Fantastic images,"The quality of the video is stunning! However, there is no sound. I tried FofTR four times and then it and the second disk played beautifully. However, with TT, again a beautiful video but no sound. I cannot get it to play with sound. I've not tried the RofTK. Too depressed after the long wait. I hope Amazon will replace these with ones that work."
5,freaking excited,"i love LOTR, read the books and watched the movies many times over. sadly, i have NEVER seen the extended versions. i don't know how. however i don't see myself buying the theatrical release on blu-ray and then turning around and buying the extended version. the movies i have now will suffice on the PS3 with my HDTV. i think it'll be a real treat for myself to finally see the extended versions for the first time when they come on blu-ray. i'm in agreement with most on here, that the studio could cut us a break and release them both together. as if the movies didn't already make a boatload of money."
4,Subtitles not accurate on Amazon.com,"Everybody will agree to confirm that these movies are amazing.However, I have one complaint concerning the subtitles:The list mentioned on Amazon.com is not correct.The correct settings are:Audio: English & PortugueseSubtitles: English SDH and Spanish.No French!"
1,Poor Business,"I originally had this at 5/5 stars. But I'm changing my answer as a thumbs down to new line and its cohorts. This is so intollerable for me that I will not be attending the Hobbit when it comes out to film. what's the point. See the film, then salivate to buy it, only then to have them yank me around for its extended version. Better to not have seen the Hobbit, than to have to go through this b.s. again."
1,Movies not on one disc each?,"I will absolutely never buy this. I love the movies, but hate having to get up halfway through the movie to change discs. With the DVDs I let them slide on not putting the films on one disc each (even though it could have been done, because I put both parts of each movie on one disc each, and the picture quality is the same). There is no excuse for them not putting both parts of each movie on one disc each with this set. This is Blu-Ray. The discs can hold so much more than a DVD."
3,You can't put one movie on one blu ray disc? Really??,"As far as I know, Blu Ray discs hold 50 gigs of information. It appears that this extended edition release on blu ray will have 6 blu ray discs, two for each movie. If they put a movie on each disc and then special features on another, that's great. But beware--if they split the movies on two discs, that's just a waste!!!"
1,Wrong Information,It is said in the product description that it has Portuguese subtitles. It is not true. The only language available are English and Spanish. Beware.
2,Not a review of the movie,"This has a nice box. But I was pretty sure that blu-rays were supposed to be these huge data holding disks right? Then why are these movies still split up over 2 disks each? I understand that high quality means more space, but seriously, why did I even upgrade from the DVD version?"
3,disc set up,"My boyfriend and I bought that as a 'Gold Box deal.' I don't like the disc set up. The movie is on 2 discs because there are 30 people involved on the commentary. I can understand the Return of the King on two discs because the movie is 263 minutes long. I have a few movies that are spread out on 2 discs and I don't watch them the often because of it.I know that it bothers some people that the original version is not on these discs, but there are 6 discs of extras."
4,A review before release - details for the buyer,"I'm not a psychic, so I can't accurately review this specific product; however, note that the other reviews on this are for the DVD set and not the Blu-Rays, so I'm not alone. I own each of the extended edition DVDs and thoroughly enjoyed them, but did not buy the theatrical release versions because I wanted the additional content.I just wanted to make sure everyone knows what to expect with this set, so I am including a link to an external site that has reviewed the package. [...]It's a bit of a bummer that each of the films is split up over 2 disks, but that's because even on Blu-Ray there is just so much that they couldn't fit any of the flicks on a 50 GB platter - NICE!Make sure you check out the easter egg content on the disks, especially the clips from the MTV movie awards. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jack Black have one of the funniest spoofs I've seen in a long time."
3,Stop this double dipping game.,Of course we have to wait until 2012 for an already ready to publish product. They have to milk the TE cow first.
4,Digital Copies are poor quality,"This blu-ray disc set is the ultimate LotR trilogy experience at this point in time, it has all he features and material you could want in a set. I am in love with it! BUT, be aware, the digital copies, which are a huge selling point for many people, are *NOT* HD, in fact as stated in a previous review, they are actually lower than DVD quality! It is shameful and a true disappointment. I am crossing my fingers that iTunes will upgrade my copies to HD when they become available, but I doubt they will be that generous."
3,Each Movie is split into two discs for no good reason,"Okay so the movie itself is excellent, and the added features are good. The problem I have is that they still split each of the movies onto two separate discs in the Blu-ray version when it is in no way necessary. Assuming it's a double layer disc that's 50 GB of data per disc vs DVD with 8.5 GB of space. So your telling me that Blu-ray encoding increases the size of the movie 5 times? Not true, you need about twice the space for encoding the higher-definition. So WHY do I have to change discs in the middle of each movie? Because the publisher wanted you to feel like you were getting more for your money. If they would have taken this into consideration and used the full capacity of each disc then I would have given this item 5 stars."
1,Movie is great on dvd,"I bought this and had some problems with the discs. I sent them back to the seller. The seller was very good about taking the return. The second disc kept stopping at the same spot. I am planning to buyy this set again, I was impressed with what I saw on the first disc and would like to see the rest. I have a new dvd player comeng in a few days and may get this after I test out the bluray player."
4,Good movies even better,"The extended version has made for a richer experience, I would recommend it to all Lord of the Rings fans,"
5,Best movie,"This product was in an offer so I bough it.I only wish the extra material were in HD, each extra dvd (3 for each movie, 9 in total) is 2 hours long.The behind the scenes is that, a behind the scenes so is a little boring, but the other to 2 dvd for each movie are documentary style."
1,Discs!,Not sure who to contact. When the disks were missing. My son said that the middle section of the box held no movie disks.
2,Tooblue,"I just received my L O R extended edition on blue ray, the whole first movie has this blue tint and terrible picture quality. It's so fuzzy in spots it's actually hard to see. I got this set for Christmas and haven't had the chance to see the others yet. If they're like this one I''ll investigate returning them. Very dissatisfied so far."
5,Muito bom,"Muito bom, para os brasileiros temos legenda em portugus (áudio somente em ingls). A verso extendida tem cenas que valem a pena, principalmente para Duas Torres e o Retorno do Rei."
5,Beautiful set!,"I love these movies, and the Blu Ray is stunning. There are tons of extras, although I don't know if any of them are different than what I had with my regular DVDs. Overall, it's worth the money to see it in Blu Ray, in my opinion."
5,Great...,"I'm living in Brazil in Americana (SP), within the time and the product is top quality. It was worth it. Excellent quality. Hugs to all"
5,excellent series,excellent series.wish there were more like it. story line and cinematography were amazing. if you haven't seen it you are missing an epic series
5,Splendiferous!,"I won't review the story lines of this trilogy since most viewers are quite familiar with them.All I'll say is that I'm ecstatic that I now possess the blu-ray versions of these films. I couldn't care less about any supposed ""green"" cast in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (which I didn't see in my disc).The detail, the clarity, the enhanced sound . . . these more than justify the purchase of a second set of the extended versions of the trilogy. I bought the first extended edition when it came out a few years ago and have made it an annual December treat to watch them (and all the extras).I can hardly wait for the two-part ""Hobbit"" films to be released in blu-ray after they're shown in theaters (December 2011 and 2012?).My recommendation is a solid ""BUY""!"
5,Great movies,I love that these movies include the extended editions. Nice case and not crazy expensive for a full Blue-ray set.
5,Finally! Buy the Extended Version Instead of the Regular Version.,"Buy the extended version.The extended edition is much better than the regular version. Much. The original version in movie theaters was hacked down in size because of fear that the length would be too much for some people. The description says that the length Blu-ray extended edition will be the ""same as extended-edition DVD."" Yeh! This should have been released from the start.Buy the extended version."
5,Extended Version or Nothing!,"LOTR Extended edition is a must have in HD format. New Line should be ashamed for this blantant attempt at fan exploitation. It may end up burning them though. They should be clamoring to release quality content like this on Blu-Ray ASAP in order to grow their user base.New Line claims to be delaying the Blu-Ray LOTR Extended Edition release until at least Summer 2011 and if the Hobbit is delayed, it may get pushed back until 2012. I am going to buy the LOTR Extended Edition in the BEST HD format available whenever it is finally released. It's entirely possible that 2-3 years from now, Blu-Ray will no longer the ""BEST HD FORMAT"" out there. There may be something new and better by then. Only time will tell."
5,A Must For Any Library,"When this showed up as a hot deal of the day, it was a must. The movies are incredible. Having them in HD is even better."
5,Worth It.,One of the best trilogy collections on blu ray. Hours and hours of extras and amazing quality High definition sound.
5,Blu-ray!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I absolutely love the Lord of the Rings trilogy in Blu-ray! Not only the scenery is breathtaking and the battle scenes even more epic, the sound quality is amazing. Unfortunately, Gollum looks a little pasty compare to the normal version, but getting Blu-ray is definitely worth your money. Also, make sure you get an extended edition. It's a million times better than the theatrical version."
5,Awesome!!!!,"I own them all, the original set on DVD, The Extended Edition on DVD, the Original set on Blu-Ray and now the Extended Edition on Blu-Ray. The Extended Edition on Blu-Ray I thought was amazing in the details and was so worth the wait. My cousins and I always get together and make a marathon out of it so it is always a long day into the night but each time I am always amazed at the excellence of the movies. I do believe the Blu-Ray editions went even more extended than the original extended editions did and there were a few more added scenes. And the details you can see the bindings on the books, the eye lashes lying on the cheeks... Awesome!!! Can't wait to watch them again, much to my mothers dismay..."
5,The lord of the Rings - extended trilogy editions,"Had just watched a few minutes of the fellowship of the rings and already noticed the difference (both picture and sound), comparing with the delux DVD version I have, on 120 inches projection screen. It is abest buy if you are a friend of the Rings."
4,Not the subtitles advertised on the cover,"A friend of mine bought this item a month ago but was dissapointed to see that the only subtitles available were english and french, it didn't include subs in spanish and portuguese as it was being advertised on the product's page.The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions, which brought me to order a set for myself, but I'm worried that it's gonna have the same problems as my friend's set, actually my order was shipped a week ago before I learned about the product being reviewed, so I hope that my order arrives with what it should be including."
5,Absolutely captivating in every sense.,"These are very powerfully absorbing films. The extended scenes lend to the texture and depth of the overall narrative. These extensions are very much welcome. Visually, each film is stunning and combined with the moving and haunting sounds immerse the viewer into seemingly richly textured and multifaceted landscapes of the fantastic vision of their world. Absolutely captivating in every sense."
3,Quality Control Is Lacking,"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. The first one we got had a mislabeled final movie disk, so we ended up getting two copies of disk 5 and no disk 6. We returned that one, ordered another, and the second one came with two copies of the 4th supplementary disk and missing the 3rd. We finally got a good copy by going elsewhere."
1,"silly, a huge disappointment","This trilogy of movies took one of the greatest works of literature and turned it into a silly action adventure romp. Though it wouldn't have been possible to convey the depth and intricacy of the books in a movie, still, nothing of real value was retained in translation, and that was surely avoidable.Most of the major characters are so distorted or simplified that they become ridiculous. The story is also gutted, and the movies become empty formula films. Do yourself a favor and read the books. Peter Jackson seemingly did, but still apparently doesn't have a clue. Tolkien, a deeply spiritual man who certainly intended more for his major work, must be rolling over in his grave."
1,Sick about The Lord of the business,I'm a fan of this movie but I'm really sick about they re-product many version many time. Movie itself is great. But Peter Jackson think he don't rich enough to get more money from his fan. For me that's it...Enough.
1,"You can wait, a bigger and better edition will arrive with The Hobbit","At first I wanted this so bad, until I found out that it's the same stuff that I already have. No added bonus content other then it's on Blu-Ray and it has a digital copy. Awesome, however I wanted to see more to it then that. I believe if I wait long enough, they will make an even bigger edition with all the extended trilogies to it, along with The Hobbit, part 1 and 2. So I shall wait for those."
1,As a Fan this is dissapointing,To think that it is not the most comprehensive version out there. makes me sad. All in all they could have done much better. My advise is don't buy this.
1,Sigh...,I was REALLY looking forward to getting LOTR on BluRay. I'm not a Videophile. I own a Bluray player (through which I do NetFlix) but I only own one Bluray because it just isn't a big enough improvement to warrant the expense.When I heard that LOTR was coming out I was happy because my only complaint with the DVD extended edition is that you have to flip the disc. I was all ready to snap this up so that I wouldn't have to mess with them in the middle of the movie.But now it looks like that isn't true so i WON'T be buying this. My DVD's are good enough if the Bluray isn't going to offer a tangible mechanical improvement.Whatever. I didn't really NEED to spend the money anyway.
1,obscene material,"Among the special features, MTV's remake on The Council Of Elrond is grossly offensive and obscene. Worse, Warner Brothers did not see fit to clearly and plainly state that the package contains the aforementioned offensive material, which, in my opinion, is not suitable for anyone under the age of seventeen, nor did they code the disk so that this content can be blocked by parental controls on blue ray players (we've tried). I doubt my complaint will persuade Warner Brothers to correct this blatant attempt to tarnish an otherwise brilliant piece of literature, by allowing MTV to wipe manure across it, making it seem like a sex rag available in any adult bookstore."
2,Movie split across discs??!?!,This could be the best movie transfer ever made and its still getting 2 stars from me. I would have never ordered this set if I knew they would do something as stupid as splitting each movie across two discs. I haven't had to change/flip a disc since the days of Laserdiscs.
4,Blu ray only for the movies,"Basically i'd like this Blu rays because of the subtitles in portuguese (cause i dont need to translate all the movies to my friends anymore)...but, in such a way it was disappointing when we talk about the others contents..extras..they are in DVD and without subtitles in portugueses...in other words..the same thing that i already have."
3,Don't pay more that 49.99 for this!,"I held off buying this when they put it on sale around Christmas for 49.99. My sweet spot for this product was 39.99. Unfortunately amazon put the price back up to 80 bucks! This is a great product and there are plenty of reviews here describing the product. This review is to help people not get ripped off by paying 80 bucks for 3 movies. Don't let them take us fans for a ride, demand a better price by making sure retailers do not sell any of this product for the 80 price tag!"
4,Very nice package,Very nice edition in a very nice package and IT has PORTUGUESE subtitles on some discks.I only give 4 stars because the info on the outside box doesn't mention the portuguese subs...
1,The dvd would'nt play on the system????,"I found out that after sending this beloved classic to my son as a surprise, he couldn't play it on his DVD system. No idea why. I so wanted to surprise him with this epic that he loves. I reviewed another series I sent to a friend - all came through perfectly and I was so excited to share this experience with my son. No idea why this purchase wouldn't play on his system. His system is far superior to mine. What a bummer of an Xmas gift! Can't even see the extras in addition to the full story! The extras, making of the film, was why I sent the package. My son so enjoyed the film version and the book version. I have no Idea why it won't play on his system. I suggested that he take it to a Barnes & Noble or Target to see if they could get it to work. Until then, a lot of money spent for a gift that was a total disappointment to the recipient and more so to me the sender."
2,Bad bluray cases,I received my blurays a few days before I expected them to arrive and was excited to watch them I opened up the fellowship of the ring and bits of the case fell out but it still worked ok then I opened the two towers and the same thing but again it still worked so I thought ok no problem. Then I finally got to the return of the king and looked and the clip that holds the blurays in is broken and wont hold them in properly so fantastic I spent 450 for my movies and they have broken cases. I have yet to contact them about it because I hate the hassles of sending stuff back especially when I really wanted to watch them but i expect to contact them by the beginning of next week.
5,Trilogy,I choose this rating cause I am a fan of The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy blu-ray. This box set contains 5 discs in a 3 movie pack. Which makes 15 discs total. This also comes with special features. The features are very long. This also comes with commentary for all 3 movies. I would recommend this to friends.
2,I have to send it back,"In the description there were Polish subtitles mentioned and this was the main reason for choosing an edition as well as a low-price offer (adding freight and customs duties it was stil cheaper than the similar version offered in Poland).Unfortunately I got a version with English, Spanish and Portugeese subtitles.As I checked after the delivery suddenly the description on the website was changed,From the very beginning there was also no info that Dvds are not readible in Europe.Blu-ray discs were working in my Blu-ray Panasonic player.The edition was perfect and beatiful, what's a pitty the offer was misleading."
5,wow,"wow great lots stuff and ""a masterly narration of tremendous and terrible climactic events,"" although he also noted that Tolkien's prose ""seems sometimes to be protracted for its own sake"
5,Perfect!,"This set was exactly what I was waiting for, looks great on my 130 projector screen! Extended edition is loaded with seamless extra footage."
5,LOTR,"The extended version adds so much to the story line. I have seen many versions of the LOTR over the years, and can say with great assurance, that this edition to the story telling on the big screen will be the last. The three films are just awesome...acting, scenery, music....the vision one sees as presented by the director bring the author's books to life as no other versions have to date."
5,Great trilogy,Tolkien did a great job writing the story but Peter jackson did a better job of bringing to life I'll bet tourism to new Zealand has had a great rise from these movies.Looking forward to the hobbit unexpected journey thanks again Peter Jackson for the great movies
5,One box set to rule them all,"What can I say?Its the LORD OF THE RINGS!Its the extended versions!Its Blu-ray!What more can a man ask for?One box set to rule them allOh, one thing though.Why are the Making of discs are DVD, when clearly they should be BDs!Otherwise why am I buying a BluRay box set?Come on Warner!"
4,lotr,I have enjoyed the DVD version and blu ray just adds so much more to my enjoyment of the series
3,"It's ok, but not the best?","Indeed this is major compilation of LOTR, but I think that an international version should be available. The final product I got, had only subs for French and English, but I needed Spanish subtitles. Double check your order and verify with the seller that you're getting what you asked for."
5,The Classic Battle Between Good and Evil,"After recently completing a 3-night marathon of watching each extended edition of the movie with my family, I can tell you that this trilogy is still one of the best ever produced if not the best. My kids are young, but they still loved it as this was their first introduction. There were parts of the movie that were a little scary for them, but the more I thought about it the more I realize that evil is ugly and scary and knowing and seeing that for themselves can help them grow. Of course as much as seeing that good can battle evil and never give up, even when unsurmountable odds are against you.This classic tale by Tolkien was so well done that in it's time it created the term ""Tolkienesque"" to describe stories that maintained a similar adventure and congruity to their story telling.So, if you want something to do on those late summer nights with no school tomorrow, pop in one of these movies and enjoy it with your family."
5,I love Blue ray!,"Amazing clarity on my led tv. My favourite movie, extended edition. What else can I say. I'm very pleased!"
5,Excellent,"I hadn't seen the extended edition of the films until I got and watched this blu ray. Not only was the picture fantastic, but the extended edition material added a new dimension to my favorite films. This is probably my best home entertainment purchase of the year."
5,Blu Ray is unbelievable!,this movie rocks in blu ray. the scenery is so clear - it's like you're there! highly recommend it for your collection.
5,Great Box Set. Great Movies. Nuff said.,"The head line says it all. This Extended Edition box set comes with all 3 movies on Blu-Ray so they look and sound beautiful on your hi-def TVs. They also come with hours upon hours of special features.In theory, you could order this box set and not even have a blu-ray player (you'll need a computer, though). The box set comes with download codes so you can get the movies on iTunes and all of the bonus features are DVDs.That's actually probably my only gripe. None of the bonus features are in HD.Other than that, this is a must own box set for anyone who loves the Lord of the Rings. The extra cash put down for this box set will get you at least 2 hours of extra run time on the feature length films. The Return of the King is now almost 4 1/2 hours long!I got this when it was on sale for $40. Well worth every penny."
4,As described and prompt,The blu ray is amazing and the service by amazon as usual was very prompt. Fantastic upgrade from the DVD by the way...
5,We love it!!!,"We love the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but we really love the movies with the extra footage! I am so glad we ordered this set!"
5,Excellent,"Best LOTR collection ever, image quality unbelievable, lots of extra material to spend watching. The box has a nice desing."
1,Discs wouldn't play,This was the Blu-Ray Extended Edition. None of the discs would play. And I was not able to get a replacement - only a refund.
3,Dented box and teared papers,"When this came in the mail, the outer box was smashed in the corner. I returned it and got a new one, which again had a dent in corner again! But it was a lot better than it was before so I was able to deal with it. When I opened it up, the little papers that go with it had small tears on the inside, which was upsetting. However, the disks were perfect though - which mattes the most. :) I'm just a little upset that I spent so much money on a 'not-perfect' product - I'm still very happy though because LOTR is awesome and there's so much extra stuff, so I am keeping it still!! :DD"
5,Infinity hours in middle earth...,Portuguese subtitles included: lots of hours on this extended edition... The Blu Ray makes the difference... More than 3h30 hours per film in1080p.
5,love it,"Great movie, any fan of the books would prefer the extended cut to the theatre release. The extra disks have heaps to offer, I love all the information about the costumes and the commentaries by actors, director and production staff. It looks like they have made some adjustments to the picture quality for the bluray edition? Everything seems much higher in res and you can see the textures in fabrics etc."
4,missing disc,When we opened the package and were watching the movies we came to abrupt halt when we found that the third movie beginning was missing. Nothing broken just missing. We notified Amazon and they sent another set out immediately. This one is just fine and we continued to enjoy the show.
3,Lord Of the Rings no DVD material for region 4,The movies are great the image quality is excellent on blu ray. The problem with the green is a lie. The only problem is the additional material on DVD is available only for region 1 and not for region 4 that is just foolish. It should have been on blu ray on the first place.
1,"""Limited"" Edition Indeed!","The studio finally announces the release of the extended edition of the films on Blu-ray, something myself and many others have been eagerly, albeit impatiently awaiting. But after going through the different versions, I see that the featurettes will NOT be included? Really New Line?I passed on the theatrical Blu-ray release because the majority of us saw a repeat of the multi-DVD version release. This will be another pass. I am not about to shell out 84 bucks for this and it is not all-inclusive. I was lucky enough to find someone to buy my theatrical version DVDs after I purchased the extended versions. I guess they will wait another year or two after this one is released to finally give us EVERYTHING in one package.Another EPIC FAIL."
1,Don't arrived,I made my purchase on May 7 and it has not arrived.I wonder if there was any problem.This was not the first time I made a purchase. The other time it did not take long.Thanks for your attentionLeonardo
1,LOTR FANS DON'T HAVE SCRAMBLED EGGS FOR BRAINS!,"Blu-Ray is here. Now. New Line is just plain greedy. WE DON'T WANT THE THEATRICAL VERSION. WE WANT THE EXTENDED VERSION. What's so hard to understand, New Line? Last time I looked, there is a recession going on. Nobody who has any brains will buy the theatrical version and then plunk down hard-earned pennies for the extended version. New Line is going to be very surprised when they finally realize that the LOTR fans don't have scrambled eggs for brains...not this time...that LOTR fans know their economics... supply and demand...that LOTR fans will sit tight and wait for the extended version, however long it takes. Enough said, fans. Just settle down with the regular versions you already have and play them in a Blu-Ray player. You'll get a great picture, trust me. It works!"
1,A Complete Embarrassment to Blu-ray LITERALLY,it's no different from the From the original Extended Editions. all 3 movies arestill split in Two and your getting the same DVD's like before and the onlyreason they split the movies in two again is just so that they can get moremoney. This Limited Edition is a Joke to the fans and is a completeembarrassment to Blu-ray. The whole reason to get The Lord of the Rings TrilogyExtended Editions on Blu-ray is or now was to see each Film in its entirety. butNo I get this split in two again I would not recommend this to any Fan.I waited all year for this ? God this sucks so much
3,"Don't stop the film, it resets to the beginning","The picture is beautiful, the extras are abundant, but when you stop the film it always resets to the beginning. Not with two stops like most discs, but with just one! With such a long movie it is not unusual to want to pause for a bit, and pause is what you have to do to hold the spot. Most DVD's have a resume or they remember where you were if you stop. None of the main discs do. I have yet to try the special feature discs, but of course they aren't as important for this issue.It is also annoying that the film is on 2 discs. Perhaps they had to to maintain quality, but it is still a hassle to break the film up.For the money, they should have made this flawless. Especially since many people already own these films & this is a repeat purchase."
3,Phoned in,"Having the movies in 1080p is nice. Still having them on two discs isn't. They could have at least up-scaled the DVD extras. I bought it for $45 so it was a deal, but I got what I paid for at that level. I'm giving the DVD set to my Dad."
5,A True Classic,"I recently added this to my DVD collection and I am glad I did. I saw the movies in the theater, watched them on DVD when they first came out and I LOVE the blu-ray edition. I bought the extended verison after reading the Lord of the Rings Trilogy on the Kindle. Reading the books caused me to want to watch the movies again, something my wife just doesn't understand. The picture was great, sharp and clear. As I said, I added this version to my collection for the extended play versions and I am glad I did. If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings, then you will want to add this to your collection.Seeing the movies again made me anxious to see ""The Hobbit"" when it comes to the big screen.Great movies!!"
5,Excelente produto!!!,"Uma saga como a do Senhor dos Anéis, no pode ficar fora da coleo de filmes de ninguém.O lanamento em bluray, foi uma grande surpresa, ainda mais, por possuir acesso a vários idiomas,com uma incrível qualidade de imagem e som."
4,The greatest movie collection finally arrives..,"One of the biggest fans of this extravagant movie collection. I own all 3 movies' extended editions individtually on DVD was eagerly waiting for the blu ray collection. I am glad i did not jump onto the Theatrical blu ray set, i had eagerly waited for the Extended versions on DVD and now i waited for the Blu ray.Waiting for the release date.I have given only 4 stars as i think the box set is very expensive, $10 less would definitely help giving it 5 stars :)"
2,Strange Dichotomy,"This is a rather short police procedural type mystery novel. The crimes are multiple and horrid. The supporting characters seem pretty bland, minimally competent, & even a bit depressing. The main characters aren't much better IMHO. The ending is rather sudden. I had my suspicions (some few clues are provided) but somehow not very satisfying. This was my 1st Coffin Series book & 1st G. Butler one as well. I know another of her books made the Black Dagger series--must be better than this one."
2,A poor excuse for a book,This is the first time I've given a two-star rating to a book because I usually check books more carefully before I read them. I don't know what I was thinking because I read a couple of Coffin books before and decided never again. Nothing has improved since then. This woman can't even write consistent intelligent sentences; I kept having to go back to see how the current sentence related to the sentences before. Poor copy editing didn't help either.The characters were flat and I swear there were more cops than suspects. The plot was weak and the denoument - well I guess the writer just got bored and stopped. Give thanks for small mercies.
1,Recipes that do not work.,"I tried only one recipe in this book, the cake on the front cover. It did not turn out at all. I think that the instructions for the filling layer in the middle are completely wrong in the book. I tried to make it twice, and I am a very good cook. So I ended up throwing the whole entire cake in the garbage, I was so frustrated."
1,milkin' it,"Good Grief.Chocolate? From Alabama?Next thing you know we'll get a Star Wars chocolate book.Should've stuck to possum and poke salad. What? You say they don't eat that stuff there anymore? MacDonalds. That's why Alabama tops out in obesity.Hey, what about moonshine and roadkill? As long as it sells books. Or maybe a movie this time."
1,Vent Visors,"I bought this product & was very disatisfied. They they were NOT the in-channel as the picture showed, they were much lighter & they were all cut crooked on the ends. To top it off they look stupid!!!!"
3,Needs Improvement,Why can't CD's like these have real music from Germany or other foreign countries?
5,Looks great,"Tried several others from bbb, disappointed. This one fits, many sizes, and looks terrific. Organized my utensil drawers perfectly. Do wish I could hook them together as one unit. I love to be organized."
5,Perfect for my kitchen gadget drawer,I use this together withRubbermaid #2915-00WHT 9x3x2 White Drw Organizerto keep my kitchen gadgets drawer organized. The small one goes across the front with little stuff in it; the larger one goes behind it with spatulas and tongs and other long stuff in it. They fit nicely together and I don't spend any time hunting through the drawer trying to find the right measuring spoon or the small bottle opener.
2,"""Stackable"" baskets don't stack!","These are nice little baskets - if you don't want to stack them. I ordered them specifically for that purpose, and the only way they will stack is if I tape them together!If all you want is a nice little basket, they really are nice. Just not for stacking, no matter what size."
1,Misleading Photograph,"I was under the impression by the photo that I was purchasing a set of drawer metal mesh design ideas, but I only got one little metal mesh organizer to fit pens. Totaling misleading photo :( I thought I was buying what was in the photograph."
5,Well-made; good-looking,"I'm reviewing the 6"" by 9"" trays. They are so much better -- and better looking -- than the cheesy plastic trays I used to have. Strong; no broken wire or anything that would catch or cut my hands. When it's time to clean my silverware drawer, all I need to do is pull out the trays and dust the drawer bottom. I bought two of these trays for my 18.75"" by 19"" drawer, as well as two 12.5"" by 9.25"" five-compartment cutlery organizers manufactured by Copco, and they perfectly fit the space."
3,Okay,"It arrived on time, no damage, but I thought I was purchasing what was in the photo. Definitely would not have paid that much for one box."
5,mesh organizers,"I bought these to organize things in areas of the bathroom where things can get wet. I wanted something that would not trap moisture underneath, and that would be attractive. These fit the bill perfectly."
3,"Awesome to the max, pt. 2","What is there to say other than this is the most 80s-tastic anime there is. Tons of fan service, if you're in to that (I am of course). So...yeah...check it out. =)"
1,Bad Book Dated and slow reading,Written during the cold war much of this story shows its age. It takes too much time to get going and background information is heaped on you. People you are not writing War and Peace. Let the background come out as we read the story. You are nearly halfway through the book before any action takes place. Pass this one by.
5,"File this under ""S"" for Smith!","I haven't had so much fun since I found out that Doc Smith had written a 4th book in the Skylark 'trilogy'! This book reads a lot like fan fiction turned professional. There are many references and uses of devices and concepts familiar to those of us who grew up at the same time as science fiction. The action sequences of Doc Smith's Skylark 'trilogy' or John Campbell's Black Star trilogy. The aliens of Star Wars and Keith Laumer. Laumer's diplomatic humor. Obviously written with full knowledge of the entire body of 'hard' science fiction and incredibly competent and delightful implementation of that knowledge. As always with a book like this, the last page came WAY too soon."
2,A great idea but a disappointing and poorly produced book.,"I could hardly wait to read this book when I learned about it since so little has been written about the long history of loving these songs. While the authors do a good job of talking about how they feel about the songs, they don't delve very deep. Most disappointing, though, is the production quality. Jon Langford's and R. Crumb's visual interpretations of their chosen ballads look as if they are very interesting but the reproductions of their drawings are so blurry that they are nearly indecipherable."
3,Oppenheimer?,"So, what does this book have to do with J. Robert Oppenheimer losing his security clearance?"
4,A Doctrine on Process,"This work by Suchochi provides the not so timid reader of theology the opportunity to understand the concepts of evil, God's aim, Christ, Redemption, Resurrection and Eschatology from the view point of Process Theology. Suchochi shows God as a truly relational Being. She explains God as one who takes us from the point we are at, considering our pasts and then providing us with the best possible combination of circumstances (considering the world's influences upon us) and developes a way to reach God's aim. Suchochi provides some diagrams that need to be studied well in order to get the most benefit from them."
5,Homegrown tales of love and life,"""Short Stories"" is sitting on a porch on a summer evening watching the sun go down. It's stories of life and love set to beautiful guitar music. Scott's voice and guitar playing are beyond phenomenal. The classic songs will become some of your all-time favorites. This is one of those albums you leave in your music player to repeat again and again. There are feel-good songs, tales of heartbreak, stories of people and journeys. You won't be disappointed and you will be supporting a true artist. Scott deserves all the appreciation in the world as a musician and storyteller. Enjoy this album then share it with all of yor friends!"
5,The finest songwriter and storyteller we've heard...,A masterpiece of thoughtful and emotion-packed stories for the ear. Take this with you on your way to your easy chair on a Friday night with a good bottle of wine and a close friend. Don't forget to dim the lights because you won't want anything to distract you from the thought provoking lyrics and incredibly mellow sounds Scott sends your way. This is a must have for any CD library. The album is unforgettable. We love it!
2,Not as good as others,"Unable to decide between this and a few books similar to it, I purchased them all so I could compare them side by side. I must agree with one of the other reviews that the pages are just photocopies that are spiral bound together...very cheaply made. And the information to record in this book isn't as nice as in others (2 for example sold here also...Our House Journal: The Story of Our Home, which is good for sentimental things like photos, and Welcome Home: A Home Improvement and Decorating Organizer, which handles the facts and sample information). I definately would not recommend this book to others."
1,Xantrex truecharge40+,"I have had two of the units and they seem to work for about 2 years and in both cases they just quit working no lights. Service has been poor and there are no service manuals available, so for someone who lives in Mexico like me they are a bad piece of equipment. I will not buy another!"
3,Great fun with a multitap and a big screen!,"I played this game on my 31"" TV and it hurt my eyes because the pieces were so small. The game creators wasted a lot of space on the stupid backgrounds and story, I wish they would have increased the size of the pieces so I didn't get a headache playing it. It is a lot of fun on a larger TV, and all the different versions are enjoyable once you figure out how to play them. The instruction manual is pathetic, it took me a while to figure out how to play a 2-player game because there is no mention of it in the booklet. If you like tetris and have a multitap and a larger TV, this game will provide you with hours of fun."
4,A Tetris Addict,I am a 40+ female and truly a Tetris Addict. This is a nice variation of Tetris for PS2. The only problem I have is that it takes forever to get to the next level.
3,"Hopeful, but not sure now...","I have been dying to get this game since I heard it was coming out last year. It keeps getting delayed and I'm wondering what the problem is. It did not get a very good review...because there are some quirks with the game that make it less challenging (according to the reviewer). I love Tetris because it's challenging and you can play it for a long time and not get bored. I really wanted to get this one because I was tired of the sound and graphics of my original PS version, but I'm not sure I want to spend [the money] if it's too easy. I might just stick to my old version and wait for the price to go [down]."
1,I can't contain my disappointment!,"Holy crap, this game blows! The graphics are muddy, the colors are washed out, the music is annoying, the game modes are just plain goofy, the multi-player modes are a snore, and I am SO burned that it isn't anywhere near as good as the Tetris game for the N64. Garbage, junk, total waste of money. Avoid!"
3,Tetris Worlds,"I'm not all that crazy about TETRIS WORLDS because of the new style of game play. I'm not all to fond of the mission modes that Tetris has now. It still plays like the original, you drop block and other shapes and the objective is to clear lines and get the four line score called a Tetris. The graphics are pretty good and the backgrounds are pretty cool as well.I'm still going to give this a 3 even though I originally wanted to do give it a 3 . I still think it's closer to 3 than it is to 4 but for those of you that love the series, this is for you and you might enjoy this one. This is a great title for younger gamers because the game is very easy to play and the game is really never the same twice. In any case, for you older gamers, rent this one first and for all you younger gamers check out this one."
2,Let Down,"I was very excited to finally get my tetris in the mail... ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch"" as they say though. There was nothing really exciting about the game. It was overall bland (no good tunes like previous versions, and boring animations). My biggest beef with the game is with the multiplayer. On N64 my favorite part of the game was playing multiplayer with my wife (especially since it is the only time she will actually play a video game). The problem is that you need a magnifying to see your game boards. Neither of us could even see what we were doing. BAD MULTIPLAYER AND BLAND."
3,Disappointing,"Tetris Worlds had two modes, arcade (which I haven't played) and story (although you wouldn't know the story unless you read the manual). There are several different game styles, most of them are pretty fun. The problem is that it seems to miss the point. Tetris is about staying ""alive"" as long as possible, and the next time you play you try to go longer. With this version after you get through level 15 you ""win"" and the game is over. I was able to do that for most of the game styles the 1st time I played them. The only place to improve is to get through the levels faster, and (for me) that's not fun.They try to allow you to make a character or sorts (a cube with an eye) but the customization is pitiful (2 eye colors, 2 hair styles) and really would have been better without it.It also takes an inexplicably long time to load both the start menu and the game board."
2,It's a 'Meh' game.,"The games is very strange but not even the cool, keep you on your toes kinda strange... its more of a ... wtf is that kinda strange. It playable but it will get old quick. Had a few scratches that would make the game hiccup too."
3,Not as good as the original Tetris,"Being a tetris fan, I picked up this game expecting to love it. well, I like it, but I find the original version better. Tetris Worlds allows you to play in one of two modes, the arcade or story mode. There are tutorials and a history of the game that you can choose to watch.In the story mode, you can choose the classic Tetris, of the following options, square, cascade, sticky, hot line and fusion. Each option has a different background setting. There are five characters to choose from, Mekukaka, Okume, Nikikonu, Anonunu and Umekume (sound Hawaiian to me). In the arcade mode, you play the regular or multiplayer option and try to clear a certain number of lines within a time limit. These game go much faster than the original game of Tetris.So bottom line, the game has a lot of different options, but fans of the orginal version of Tetris may be in for a letdown. One other thing. This is a ""blue disc"" game, but it works fine on my PS2."
2,Could not understand it,"I bought it so my brother and I could play tetris against eachother. I am not sure if the game does not allow for two players, but it was so difficult to understand I gave up on it. Played it maybe twice and forgot about it."
4,Very good game; can't go wrong with Tetris,"I am surprised by some of the negative reviews. This is a quality game that provides a lot of fun and entertainment value, especially considering the relatively cheap price tag. I recommend this to all gamers!"
4,Great fun!!! ****,I used to have this as a sample game. I never could find anything that had the whole game. Then i played this. I used to play other tetris' but nothing compares to it like this one. I love how the pieces are split into two colors so they can break apart. You'll have a lot of fun with this game. I know i did. I recomend that you buy this game. It is loads of fun and will keep you busy for a long time.
2,Quite disappointing game,"I used to play tetris on the PC all the time, even with 2 player mode side by side.This adaptation of the game on PS2 is quite disappointing. First, the menu options are extremely confusing. Did they not have $ to hire an usability engineer? The graphics makes you dizzy when you play the game.If you like tetris, I would recommend something like the Bust-a-Move franchise or Puyo-Puyo on the Mac."
2,Disappointing,"After all of that waiting on extended release dates, I was very disappointed to see the finished product...: the graphics are lame and the game modes are boring.I would only order this game if you are desperate for a new tetris fix for your PS2. Otherwise, skip it."
1,How do you mess up Tetris?,"Well, apparently you can, if you spend all your money and time programming in changing your characters eyebrows, but fail to add a single option to the multi-player aspect. You can't play one single decent game with your friend - there is no option to change the two-minute time limit. How much crap is that? Not to mention, the music has no customization, and gets irritating after a while. And they could have let you disable that females voice, but she just continues to talk to you in single player mode. WORST. TETRIS. RENDITION. EVER. Do not spend a single cent on this game. It's only a huge frustration."
2,Alot different than the original.,"I'd been playing Tetris on my phone the most so I thought I'd get a version for my PS2, I was disappointed with Tetris worlds. One thing I noticed that was different than my cell phone version which I hadn't seen anybody mention was that when turning the pieces they turn counter clockwise. I don't know if it screws anyone else up like it does me, but I literally can't play it because as the game gets faster I keep screwing up and dropping the pieces into place turned the wrong way just cuz it's such a habit. It seem like there's less of a speed change between levels too so the game drags on and on."
2,Can get pretty boring!!!,The Xbox version of this game is much better!! The story mode is extra lame and there's not much difference between it and the arcade mode.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,This is advertised as a russell athletic sweatshirt but it is a cheap no name brand. The sweatshirt is as thin as a t-shirt. It is misadvertised and is horrible quality.
5,One of my favorites,"Having watched it the first time over 10 years ago, it is still one of my favorite movies. It has an all star cast that works well together. The story line, albeit silly, is interesting and deeply routed in Asian humor, that generally being more of a physical comedy than actual spoken joke. I would recommend this to anyone who has a good sense of humor."
2,90 minutes of my life I'd like to have back,"I watched this movie on VCD. I grew up in Hongkong so I'm prepared for loud dialog and a silly plot. It's a story about 3 brothers and their quest for their mates. The oldest brother is married but is cheating on his homey but homely wife, who underwent a beautifying change after she leaves him. The second brother is an effeminate guy who's attracted to a very masculine woman. The third brother is a playboy who uses women like Kleenex. The part with the third brother losing his marbles after a bad fall, and the treatment after, is such absolute silliness and wasted the talents of the actors involved. This movie is good for a few laughs but... there are definitely better comedies out there."
4,Emotions,"The cd is beautiful, but is not perfect. Is not perfect because there's no shania voice! And everything that remember Shania need to have her perfect voice."
1,Unless you're looking for a TOY - don't waste your $!!,"So, look at the DETAILS: what comes in a 1""x2"" box can't hold much, especially for a book. This would be appropriate for 10 year-olds, but if you're looking for something informative, look elsewhere. Not even worth the money. Not even worth returning."
1,DON'T BUY HOT STONE KIT,Hot stone mini kits...I thought I could use it for the face or hands but the stones (pebbles) they are so small you can't use it. The size of a penny and smaller. Don't waste your time looking at it. Some where chipped (not that that mattered because of the size!)The picture on the box of the stones are bigger than the stones in the box.
1,Quarter sized pebbles! Don't bother,"More disclosure could have been offered for the actual size of this ""Mini-Set"". Most people think mini set refers to quantity of the stones, not size. This is a cute door prize or gag gift, but to use on your clients...be prepared to be ridiculed."
2,Small to Say the Least!!,"Hot Stone Massage (Mini Kits)I purchased this kit with the sole intent of using it on my small 5 pound Yorkshire Terrier. I have Stone Healing for Your Pets (kit) by Sonia Alexandra and the stones are quite large. I still use them but these are great for my Yorkies feet, legs and tail areas. I would not buy this kit for my own personal use because they are too small."
3,I thought this tea was so-so,"The reason I give this tea 3 stars is because it wasn't totally to my taste. I like a strong, malty black, and this was more weak. I've visited Teance in San Francisco, and I have a feeling that the tea that you get in their shop is the freshest, and since I now live in Austin, Texas, and got this tea in a small sample in a plastic bag, it may have been worse for the travel, and older than the Teance flagship location.I've written more about what I think of this tea here:[...]"
1,Not That Good,"This book is not very good, but since I like Jennifer L. Hewitt it was o.k. She is really cool,but the book is not all that good. You can find most of the infromation that is in the book online, if you type in Jennifer Love Hewitt in any search engine . I only recomend this book for girls aged 8-11 who are really into, or want to be like Jennifer Love Hewitt."
4,Great Book,"It's a great book. It has lots of pictures and imformation and it doesn't have 2million words in it. If you want a great book and lots of cool pictures of Jennifer Love Hewitt, you should take this book."
4,PICTURES & CURIOSITIES & CHARM,"This book is made for fast reading, in magazine-style. It features information and curiosities about the life and carrer of Jennifer Love Hewitt. It tells, without many details, her first steps in TV series when she was a kid. About 30 pictures show the grace of one of the most beautiful and charming faces we have seen in the last years on the TV screen and in the movies. And, certainly, this is just the beginning of a very succesful career of this very talented artist. The book should bring an interview with her."
4,"Nerz did a great job of bringing ""Love"" into my life.",Nerz did a great job explaining the details of Love's life. I bought this book for my niece but I picked it up and could not put it down. Jennifer is really classy. I bet Nerz is a groovy guy..How else would he know all those facts in his book!! Enjoy!!!
5,Blue Rodeo's finest album,"This is one of my favorite CD's of all time. This is a much beloved band in Canada and it has always mystified me how they have not been more successful in the U.S. If you like Wilco, The Jayhawks, Whiskeytown or even the Wallflowers, please listen to this. Blue Rodeo is superior to any of those bands.To some degree, I like all 7 Blue Rodeo CD's but this is their pinnacle. They have two lead singers/songwriters who have individually achieved great moments on various CD's but this is the one where they are both in top form. Keelor performs a classic Hasn't Hit Me Yet as well as some more introspective gems such as Dark Angel. Cuddy performs two songs that are among his best ever in Five Days in May and the magnificent Bad Timing. In addition, they do a wonderful version of Rodney Crowell's Til' I Can Gain Control. This album is truly a joy."
5,Absolutely Wonderful! Buy this CD! You Will Love It!!,"Ok, so I am picky and a so very tired of liking a song on the radio, buying the cd, and having the rest be garbage and sound absolutely nothing like the hit song - do you know what I mean?? This however is a real keeper. There is no reason this band and their songs should not be all over the charts. They are so very very good! Every song well done, instrumentally, vocally, lyrically... Buy it, you will love it!"
5,Astounding!,"This disc is one of the best I've ever heard. The hooks keep coming, and a different song sticks in my mind each time I hear the CD. It reminds me a lot of Roger McGuinn's stuff. The only reason it is not considered a classic is that no one knows about it."
4,"You Are a Fan, You Know You Are... Or Should Be","There likely isn't anything I could add to this long list of rave reviews, other than to say it would a shame to call or think of Blue Rodeo as country music. Just a crying shame. These boys have a level of imagination, intelligence, passion, and perhaps most importantly, diversity, long long gone in country music. This album is priceless, and means a great deal to me. I am forever in debt to the friend who introduced me to Blue Rodeo all those years ago. If you don't own this album, buy it. ""Five Days in July"" will surely be a lifelong companion."
5,Origonal and Bold. Exceptionally sinegized. Emotionally raw,"Words do not express what can be taken from this CD. Blue Rodeo is by far a band that is overlooked in America, by accident. I only hope that when the American mainstream finds this band, they do not ruin it."
5,AWE INSPIRING,"I FIRST HEARD BLUE RODEO'S FIVE DAYS IN JULY AT WORK ONE DAY, WHEN A FELLOW EMPLOYEE BROUGHT IN THE TAPE. RIGHT AWAY I HEARD THREE SONGS THAT JUST MADE ME STAND THERE IN A TRANCE. WHO ARE THESE GUYS AND WHY HAVE'MT I HEARD OF THEM BEFORE? BAD TIMING WAS THE MOST TEAR JERKING LOVE SONG I HAD HEARD SINCE JOHN HIATT'S "" ICY BLUE HEART"" AND ""LIPSTICK SUNSET"" AND THEN THE ECLECTIC HEAD OVER HEELS WITH IT'S CATCHY UPBEAT HOOKS AND LYRICS AND RODNEY CROWELL'S ""TILL I CAN GAIN CONTROL AGAIN. I WAS BLOWN AWAY. I BOUGHT THE TAPE AND NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT IS ON MY TOP TEN LIST OF ALL TIME FAVORITES. BEING A CANADIAN WHO NOW LIVES IN ARIZONA, I AM SO PROUD OF THESE GUYS, AND IF YOU LIKE ROOTS ROCK OR IF YOU LIKE COUNTRY YOU WILL LOVE THIS C.D. EVERY SONG WILL LEAVE YOU FEELING LIKE YOU KNOW THIS BAND INTIMATELY"
4,Blue Rodeo is really on their game!,"What can be said about this album other than ""WOW!"" From the first test notes of harmonica on ""Five Days In May"" to the piano outro of ""Tell Me Your Dream"" and everything in between this album is terrific! There are a lot of musical surprises, for starters: Greg Keelor's guitar solo at the end of ""Five Days..."", James Gray and Kim Deschamps trading solos on ""Cynthia"", special guest appearances by Sarah McLachlan (sp?) on several songs and the a capella section of ""Know Where You Go/Tell Me Your Dream"". Jim Cuddy also masterfully croons Rodney Crowell's ""Til I Can Gain Control Again"". I'd say if any Blue Rodeo album were a must-have, it's this one."
2,Horrible pronunciation,Hans Christian's music is very good and Kim Waters voice is melodious but her pronunciation is horrible and it's very disheartening that no care is taken in pronunciation when singing devotional songs and If you are an Indian you will get disappointed if you listen to this CD. Kim Waters should have translated and sung these songs in her own native language rather than murdering the sanctity of the devotional songs by singing with such horrible pronunciation.
1,On off button sticks,The on off button on the one I received would stick and you couldn't turn the lashlight off. I returned it.
5,Mesmerizing history,"I read this a few years ago and finally purchased my own copy. I love American history--history, period--of this time period, and am always pleased to find buried treasures in African-American history during this period that shows that African-Americans lived, breathed, worked, played, LOVED, etc in spite of poverty, Jim Crow and legalized racism. Sol White's book is a marvelous find for sports fans and history lovers alike, and even if you have no interest in baseball, the bevy of facts and activities White and the other documents chronicled are amazing and inspiring."
1,An Utter Waste of Both Time and Money,"This peculiar and rather long-winded book contributes nothing whatsoever to the spiritual discussion. I had high hopes for the book because of its boldly ambitious title. Unfortunately, as I soon discovered, it is merely one more of those awful pedantic items that can ramble on for page after page without ever really saying anything new, useful, or interesting. I'm no environmentalist, but I couldn't help feeling just a little bit sorry for the poor trees who gave their lives for this book; but I feel even sorrier for the sincere, spiritual seekers who will waste their time and money to read it. If you're looking for something profound to read, you'd be well-advised to look elsewhere."
5,An Explosion of Emotion.,"John Paul Klos, the Pope of Poetic Pop, and his piano playing sidekick Jacob ""Liberace"" Smith bring rock to new levels with their soulful jazz and raw bluesy fusion that meshes into a ecletic blend uniquely their own. Quietly reknown as musicians' musicians, the duo is joined by Jonathan van Herik, Graeme Gibson, Gabe McDonough and a host of back-up horn players who subtley string out melodies behind Klos' four octave, sometimes eery, and always ruggedly powerful voice. This is not your 12 year old sister's poster boy group. These guys are real, exceptionally talented, and offer a tremendous emotional surge of simple yet sophisticated music with lyrics painted to match. A rare combination that makes for an LP to listen to up close; and the more times you listen the better it gets. I recommend it highly."
4,Moody...Dream-like....,"This is a beautiful CD...Not one for just any mood mind you..But when you happen to stumble into one of those rainy-day trances, this is the perfect soundtrack. Perfect for popping in late at night or as background music that will sure to have your company saying ""wow who is this?"" my advice? If you think that you would like dreamy female vocals over ethereal, moody electronics...Just get it..And save it for a rainy day."
1,Bad Description,"Don't buy this book if you think it contains any knowledge to help you pass the CPA exam. The description states that the book will give the reader ""real world intelligence, strategies and experience from industry experts to prepare you for everything the classroom and textbooks won't teach you."" The only thing this book talks about is how the CPA exam requirements have changed and how the profession is changing. You could learn more by going to the AICPA website and spending 2 minutes there. The book will literally take the average reader about 15 minutes to read because it's so small and has large print. There is absolutely nothing useful that can be applied toward the CPA exam. This is probably the worst purchase I have made on amazon.com - don't make the same mistake I did."
4,Megatech Hopper-Fly,"Megatech offers one of the easiest helicopters on the market to fly.Perfect for begineers it survies crash after crash as you learn to takeoff and land. If you haven't mastered this capability yet, you will only crash and break many of the expensive models designed for advanced fliers. Because they know you will break, them they offer dozens of replacement parts $$$$$.The Megatech Hopper-Fly suggested parts: ""Rotor Blades"" and only if after months and months of use the rotor blades break. (they go on with a Philips Head in about 5 minutes)Quality of Product: ExcellentI have bought several Megatech models; Hovercraft, Hopper-Fly Helicopter (blue), Airship 1/51 and Megatech Green Helicopter and they are all great. (I just wish Megatech would get into the RC Tank Model business)"
1,A Piece of JUNK,I bought this and the transmitter was DEAD ON ARRIVAL. They wanted me to pay the shipping back plus $13.00 to repair a brand new product. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,total trash,"I bought this for my 15 year old son for Christmas.On the third flight, it suddenly crashed, breaking off the tail, and one of the propellers. For $80, it should certainly last a little longer than the day it was opened."
2,Don't waste your money,"The concept it GREAT!!! The performance is great while it works which is about 1-2 hours or 1-2 crashes. The plane is not made very well and the company knows it, therefore won't support any concerns. My son and husband loved this item OUT OF THE BOX. The fun just didn't last very long for such a pricey item. My advice research this item, and then find something else to spend your $60.00 on...this isn't worth it."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this for my nephew for Christmas from one of the vendors on December 16th 06. Didn't get the merchandise and found that the order was mailed back to the company because I used a PO Box. I had to call to find this out. If they can't ship to PO Boxes using their carrier why did they ship it out in the first place. I wonder if I had not called, would they have credited my card back at all? When I called, the company was friendly and responsive and mailed the product out again, but, I didn't receive it until January 5th 07. The product was defective, we had to push the battery up in the casing before the remote would work. Once we did that it worked nicely,but, for the money I don't feel I should have to hold the battery in place. It was hard to control also. I won't buy this product again."
4,Good deal,I found it inconvenient to charge my Sansa MP3 player from my laptop (the laptop goes on power save if I'm not using it and then decharges vs charges the Sansa) or my desktop (I don't really use it anymore and it's a waste of electricity to turn it on just to charge the Sansa). This little inexpensive charger is convenient and charges the Sansa in less time than a computer. I subtracted 1 star because the adapters do not plug directly into the Sansa. You need to have the original charging cord used with the computer. You plug the original cord into the Sansa and then into the charger and then plug it into the wall. I don't think the product description included you need the original charging cord and I'm glad I still had mine. I've had the charger for several months now and it works very well.
4,Durable and works as intended,"Great companien to the Griffin dock station, a must that would have been nice to have included with the Fuze SanDisk player."
1,Vital Information Missing !!!,"Was away on vacation and forgot my charger for Sansa Clip (Sansa Clip to Computer). Ordered this charger and had it express shipped to my location just to discover that I needed my original charger to utilize. Amazon rarely disappoints, but this information NEEDS to be included in the description of this charger for Sansa Clip users. Not sure if this charger is good/bad or useful at all - right now I couldn't care less as I've wasted two days waiting for its arrival and after receipt, I'm on my way to Best Buy to purchase an original charger to use. Sorry Amazon - this time you fell short. Need for original charger is clearly indicated on package - again, this needs to be spelled out in description of product for purchaser."
5,Fabulous Christmas Patterns,"Everyone looks for different things when chosing a book, but to me the most important thing is whether or not I actually made anything from the patterns. I have made 1 of the candle mats and one wall hanging quilt. That alone makes this book a winner to me. I had no difficulty with either pattern and felt encouraged to actually machine quilt them, which worked well because of the smaller size. This book is a must have for anyone wanting to create fun items for the Christmas season. I count 45 different pattern ideas, enough for all your friends and yourself. You won't be disappointed with this book."
2,Not what I expected,"This production, although it provides some information, is not what i expected from reading some of the other reviews. Some of the clips are repeated and , although there is ample opportunity to give better insight in the wine production( even on an amateur level) in Burgundy, nothing really is provided. It is a quite basic production and the production is, with some minor exceptions, quite amateurish.Particularly for people with some basic understanding of the Burgundian wine culture this is not a DVD worth purchasing.It shows some of the techniques, but nothing is ever explained. The interviews are basically like all other interviews with winemakers across the wine producing World. Nothing new or exciting."
3,Not the best way to fight a cold.,"A true believer in the benefits of herbs for prevention and treatment of disease, I decided to give this tea a try a few years ago. I worked in an office where we were exposed to just about every cold and flu bug that came down the pike. I figured a little echinacea in my tea might help prevent those nasty secondary bacterial infections--such as bronchitis or sinusitis--that often follow viral illness.With the addition of eucalyptus, menthol, peppermint, licorice and anise, the tea tastes okay (unlike some other medicinal concoctions). However, the anti-biotic herb is just too diluted to do a sick person much good. It's better to get your echinacea in capsule form.Also, if you are allergic to ragweed, this may not be a good tea for you, as echinacea is from the same family of plants and may cause serious side affects to sensitive individuals. In that case, I would recommend astralagus, a natural Chinese immune system booster, instead."
4,Ghost Boat,Read it when it first came out and enjoyed it. Some people will find it dated but it still draws you in. A good Triller/Mystery/Military Novel.
4,Great for Sonic lovers!,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he just loved it. He mentioned that the voice of Sonic is really annoying when he sings. Despite the voice actor, this is a must for any Sonic collection."
3,Another solid effort,"This disc does not quite reach the heights of the previous ""Full Service No Waiting"" (his best Vanguard album) but is another strong set of tunes from Case that would get 3.5 stars if allowed. This one is, however, a bit more joyous and propulsive. ""Paradise etc."" and ""Coulda Shoulda Woulda"" are highlights. Greg Leisz again provides some nice lap and pedal steel playing, but it seems Case sometimes overuses him; a little less would be more in this case. Still, good, solid stuff that deserves a wider audience. Check out his first two Geffen albums if you can find them."
1,Yawn.,This book is awful. It merely gives literary conjecture and refence to all the idealist types. It didn't help me learn anything new. I was really disappointed. There are so many other books out there that are better. Don't buy this one.
2,Costly Printer over the long run,"We purchased two. We have been happy with the print quality in black & white. The two machines color printing is good enough for us, but printing the same color document on both machines shows noticeable differences in the output between the two units.Toner is very expensive for these machines on a per/page basis. Also, it regularly displays messages that we need to spend another $[...]ish for imaging units, fuser units, etc. It seems never ending with this machine. ""Another $[...] bucks....""The are fast and the double sided printing is nice. They are not quiet. It is disturbing when on the phone."
2,not so milky white as i expected,not so milky white as i expectednot so milky white as i expectednot so milky white as i expected
3,My sons review,"kinda liked this game, reminded me of gran turismo. it gets boring but hey the racing and graphics are awesome. and the turning is smooth kinda"
5,A DIFFICULT BOOK TO READ,"IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET THIS BOOK, BUT IT WAS WORTH IT. GUSTAV HASFORD'S LAST BOOK, IT IS NOT FUN AND TAKES SOME DISCIPLINE TO FINISH. NOT UP TO THE STANDARD OF FULL METAL JACKET; SEEMS HURRIED AND TRITE. HE WAS A ""DIFFICULT"" PERSON AND HAD HE LIVED, MIGHT OF DONE GREAT THINGS. I KNOW A BUDDY OF HIS WHEN GUS LIVED IN MY AREA, AND HE CONFIRMS MY OBSERVATIONS. IF YOU WANT TO GET TO KNOW GUS HASFORD, THIS IS A ""MUST READ"". NO IT IS NOT FOR SALE."
3,Nosey Cup,"This is a great cup for people with disabilities. Our family member has Parkinson's. This fits over his glasses and nose and he does not have to tilt his head back to take a drink. I am only giving this 3 stars due to the company showing a photo of 3 when only 1 comes with the order. A total of about $10.00 (including shipping) is a ridiculous price to pay for one plastic cup. However, the cup itself, is a great thing."
5,Outstanding!,"This is one of the most original and beautifully written Christain contemporary albums I have heard in a long time. Each song is unique and tells a story. Anyone with interest in Christian or Gospel music should buy this album. It will surely be a blessing to your life, as it was to mine!"
5,Fantastic reference for law students and everyone else!,"Prof. Yogis' dictionary proved indispensible during my first year of law school, and I continue to use it throughout second year. When it comes to Canadian legal terminology, this is the dictionary to use."
5,Great Regency Romance,"I am a big fan of Kasey Michaels, and this is by far her best book. I loved the main characters, and the story was brilliant. Gabby is a great heroine. She desperately needs to marry a rich man, but she can't seem to get over the fact that the men in the ton are vain hypocrites. She especially hates Lord St. Claire, the leader of the ton, even though he has made her popular. Christian is not who he seems, however, and both of them have to look past their initial impressions of one another to discover someone ""they could love."" This book has mystery and suspense as well as really hot romance, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read historical romance."
2,What the heck?!,I purchased this cd because I was looking for Christmas songs from my childhood. What a disappointment! All of the songs are recorded with a techno beat as if they were meant to be danced in a club or disco. I certainly didn't like it and I can't wait to get rid of it.
5,Sunbeam Breadmaker,"Very pleased with this product. Simple to use and lightweight. I only use the dough cycle, though, since I prefer to bake bread in my oven."
2,Got to use it three times. No customer service.,"The three times I used it the machine was good, except it didn't get all the flour, etc. from the corners. Using a spatula helped with that. Today i made a loaf of bread and wanted to make a second loaf. It's been unplugged and cooling off for three hours and it won't let me program it. I just bought a different machine. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,"Well, It Could Be Better!","I am an avid bread maker and decided, after my old machine gave up the ghost, to purchase this one. Aside from the size (way too large) the bread pan is easy to take from the machine...just twist and turn! On the downside, a major downside, it cooks too long. If baked bread goes the entire length of cooking time, the crust is hard as nails and not worth eating...birds love it though! The cooking time should be decreased 15 minutes for a light crust with both one and two pound loaf cycles. The recipes are heavy in ingredients. I would suggest decreasing the flour and only adding flour till the ball of dough is shiny and smooth. Just my 2 cents worth and no I won't buy this machine again!"
4,Good basic bread maker,"After 10 loaves of different types of bread, I can say this is a reliable consistent basic bread machine that works well and is extremely cheap. I took one star off for the poor design of the LCD screen that can be barely read in a bright kitchen."
1,Be forewarned,"We owned a Zojirushi for about 8 years and when it recently broke down we chose the Sunbeam based on customer reviews (the Zojirushi was too expensive to replace). The first one arrived quickly from Amazon and although it baked excellent bread it made a huge clunking noise when kneading that you could hear from upstairs. When we called Sunbeam they said this was normal which we could not believe. So we returned it as defective and received a replacement. This next one made no clunking noise (so much for the ""this is normal"") but did a poor job of letting the bread rise (it didn't apply any heat at this point). So we returned it and got a credit. We then noticed that Walmart sells the same model so we bought it at Walmart and yep, it made that great clunking noise. So back it went to Walmart and ordered a Breadman TR875 from Amazon. Works well and is a keeper."
4,nice little machine for the price,"This is the third bread machine I have purchased and for the price, it is fine. I personally prefer the vertical loaf machines-this one makes a horizontal loaf-but it works fine."
5,I LOVE my breadmaker!,"I bought this when it was on Amazon for about $38, though I had to pay for shipping (it seems Amazon isn't carrying it themselves anymore). I am just making some 3/4 whole wheat 1/4 bread flour bread now. Yum! I go to recipezaar for most recipes, I am not using the ones from the book (since everyone said not to). :)"
5,great merchandise with reasonable price,"I loved my new bread machine a lot, so far it works great for my need, I baked almost 2 or three times a week with it, every load comes out great, with it's inexpensive price compare to the other models in the market,I feel I got the real value. I enjoyed it a lot."
5,Great but there is room for improvement,"I did some research on bread machines before I decided to purchase this one. I was looking for the best relation between quality and price, and I think I did get it with this machine. I haven't bought store bread ever since, the machine probably already paid for itself.Pros: Price, makes great bread provided you have a good recipe (never tried the book that came with it), variety of settings (basic, french, whole wheat, sweet, etc) and you can also pick if you only want to make the dough or only bake the bread in the machine.Cons: Little noisy (not too much I think), would be better if it had an option of making your own cycle (longer/shorter rising time or baking time for example)."
1,sunbeam breadmaker,"Never recieved item, have no idea whom to contact. paid for, but no breadmachine. Will never buy anything ever again from this company or Amazon.com."
3,Bread maker comments.,"Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable BreadmakerThe machine is a beautiful machine, however, I have a couple of suggestions. The beater in the base of the pan always remains in the loaf when it is removed from the pan. A device holding it in the pan would make it a much smoother operation and hopefully a smaller hole in the bottom of the loaf.Also - no matter which type of bread I make the crust is always thick and hard. I believe this may have something to do with the temperature of the machine while baking. There is no soft sides of the loaf.Thank you for the opportunity to add my comments."
1,After one year,"I bought mine last March and have been making a loaf of bread just about every week. Today it made its last loaf, the motor was straining to turn the paddle.Positive: The price.Negatives: LCD is next to impossible to read. Made to be viewed by someone under 5' tall, I over 6'. Bread crust is over-cooked, even on the light setting. It never wanted to make a great loaf of bread, no matter how hard I tried. To load the pan I had too pull the machine out from under the cabinet and turn it so the lid would open wide enough for the pan.I'm tired of messing with this machine. I have 3 weeks left on the one year warranty, and won't waste my money shipping it back. My previous machine cost $180, but it lasted 7 years. This one was $40, and lasted one year. Add me to the never again group on Sunbeam bread machines."
2,It's a machine that is worth only 40+ dollars....,It looked ok when it first arrived...but after you used it. You will never find the right way to make the good bread...!! I don't think I will consider the same brand again.
4,Breadmachine Review,It is a good machine. I bought it to replace one that I had for 11 years that the pan lost a piece. It does not have the power to make my cinnamon roll recipe and the numbers are hard to see. It's an okay machine. It makes good bread and pizza dough.
3,Not bad for the price,"I use this machine just for the dough cycle. I find all bread machines bake dry bread. This machine does a great job on the dough. Two complaints about it though. You cannot see the display at all. Also, I have to use a pair of pliers to get the paddle out of the pan when the dough is done."
2,Something Loose Inside !,"I received the breadmaker, and when I was taking it out of the box, I noticed something rattling inside the bread maker. I noticed that there was a Chinese ""QC Passed"" sticker on the bottom of the machine. Great job guys.I tried to take the bottom off the breadmaker, but it won't come off. I guess that I will have to leave the loose screw or whatever it is , inside until it shorts out the electrical components. It's not worth the $15.00 shipping to return it for a new one. I was hoping for a little better quality for a $60.00 BREAD MACHINE !"
2,"Great machine, until it broke - just two years old.","Hello bread makers - The Sunbeam was a great little machine, until last week. For two years, I made bread two - three times a week, sometimes baking it in the machine but mostly using it to knead the dough which I then finished by hand and baked in the oven. It was my first bread maker and I really loved it. Then last week, it started on some new dough and in less than a minute, it was all over. The kneading paddle had stopped turning. The steel bolt attaching the paddle to the gear shaft had worn away the aluminum collar - too much play when turning.So here I am back checking Amazon reviews to try a different machine."
5,Freaking Awesome!,I have made I don't know how many loaves of bread with this since Christmas....It keeps one from having to kneed the dough for hours....I personally roll it out once it is done and add my favorite meats and cheeses to it. They are a huge hit at parties...This machine takes the work out of making homemade bread and puts the joy into it!
5,Best breadmaker ever !!!!!,"The instructions are easy to follow,it's easy to clean and it makes the best bread ever ! My daughter made a whole wheat loaf and it was absolutely delicious ! Nothing complicated, pretty straightforward .It's also fun to watch the yeast rise through the glass top ! We're very happy with this purchase, reasonably priced for the quality. For first time bread makers I think we made a great choice buying this sunbeam breadmaker !"
4,So far so good,I have only used it once and it worked well. I make gluten and casein free bread and the bread maker did well in making an edible loaf of bread. The bread machine has a lot of bread making variations and even an option for making jam. So far it is a good deal for the price.
4,Breadmaker,"Glad I bought this, can make different types of breads, healthier than shop boughtThe pan is a little tight to remove sometimes. The outside does not get hot - incase you touch it accidently. Beeps when done, but as it is programmable, I can leave to bake overnight and wake up to the smell of fresh bread! Nice.."
3,Sunbeam 5891 Breadmaker,Recipes in booklet just don't work out. Still trying to adjust to my altitude. Use it for dough making and it is perfect for that.
3,Paddle wore a hole in the pan,"We bought our machine at Fry's Electronics for $34 and we got our money's worth. We had it for three years. During the last few months, I couldn't figure out why my bread turned out so dry all the time! I also couldn't figure out why I kept smelling burning bread.One day as I was carrying the filled bread pan to the machine, I noticed water dripping from the bottom of the pan. The machine had worked a hole in the pan...water & flour were leaking into the turning mechanism at the bottom of the oven.There was no fixing it. We threw it out. But we did use the thing for 3 years and it made a decent loaf. To be honest, I only used it for kneading dough and I proofed & baked the loaves in my own oven to get a lighter loaf."
4,Exceeded expectations,This thing is spectacular and is a great buy at the selling price.I am a complete novice to baking and can turn out great breads. In addition to the quality bread I use it often to make pizza dough.My only complaints are that the loaf pan is pretty thin and that it is made in china.
5,Great Bread Maker,This is a truly great device. I have baked several loaves of bread since purchasing this machine and all have turned out wonderfully. I did buy a bread machine cookbook with the machine and have found the recipes in it to be wonderful and easy to prepare. The Sunbeam bread machine has all of the features mentioned in the recipe book so it is easy to make many different varieties of bread with perfect results! I will buy another Sunbeam when this one craters.
2,very thick crust,"we have been trying a few breadmachines and the bread coming out from this Sunbeam had a very thick and hard crust, independently of the crust level selected. Some of the bread was ok on the inside, but it looked like a brick when handling it.Also a bit noisy. When mixing the dough, the machine is very unstable and does some noise."
1,You'll be sorry if you buy this one,"I have to agree with the lousy reviews on this machine. I bought one about 4 months ago based on reviews and price after my beloved Breadman breadmaker stopped working after many, many years. I was never satisfied with the bread from the Sunbeam, and had problems with the loaves rising properly. I altered the water content and finally learned to make an acceptable loaf, but was still mildly disappointed every time I pulled a loaf out of the machine. I noticed recently that the stir paddle was getting difficult to turn, and this morning (after I had all the ingredients in the pan) it wouldn't turn at all. My husband fiddled with it, but we finally decided to toss it and get another machine. Not sure which one I'll buy, but it will definitely not be a Sunbeam! Don't waste your money."
2,You get what you pay for,"The cotter pin on the pan coupler on my machine broke after two months of use. Collecting on the warranty involves shipping off the entire machine, at the owner's expense. Instead I bought a new pan-basket, which cost, with shipping, almost 30.00. If I have any other problems at this point, I'll invest in a sturdier machine rather than continue to throw good money after bad."
1,"Did not work, but painless return with Amazon","We had this a few days, could not get it to make a loaf that would rise. Sent it back painlessly through Amazon, got a full refund and never had to pay shipping. Hooray Amazon, Boo crappy bread maker!"
2,high hopes... didn't meet them,"I got this breadmaker for christmas last year.. and finally took it out of the box last week when I started to mill my own flour. I've attempted 2 loaves, and they are not only incredibly sunken/collapsed, but the density of the bread varies wildly in each loaf. After the first failed loaf, I did a lot of research on ""collapsed breadmaker loaves"" and make all the recommended changes, and still the same.The bread was very dense in some areas and so non-dense in other areas that I couldn't even cut it - it wouldn't support its own weight under the knife.So, tonight I bought the Zojirushi, and although expensive, I hope it will work. Baking my first loaf now, and will post under that product how it came out.Better luck with yours..."
5,A year later and still going strong,"We have used this bread maker for over a year now and have made quite a bit of bread, but we have primarily used it to make pizza dough. This machine has worked phenomenally for making pizza dough. We have made dozens of pizza crusts. For the price we have been more than happy with it."
4,Sunbeam Bread Maker,"Love it. Grew up with my mom, grandmother and aunts making bread from sctrach, but I didn't have the patience to do it myself. Breadmaker is perfect for me and my daughter, who loves homemade bread."
2,High defective assembly rate,"I ordered 2 units for Christmas presents. One unit had a screw loose inside - was 1 of 3 screws holding the power/mixer drive unit in place and was in a position such that I could not get the screw back into its hole, so I sent it back. Then later I got news on 2nd unit.Its delayed start button fell to inside of control panel (probabaly missing the part behind it that holds it in place?) on the very first press of the button. I had already replaced the 1st defective unit with another one when I learned of the defective button. After testing all its buttons, so far it seems to be OK, no loose screws or buttons, but not much time has passed since X-mas to be sure how it will hold up. The 2nd defective unit will be replaced with a different brand. But it does make good bread when you have a fully functional unit. Too bad the assembly quality is so poor. Thank you Amazon for taking back the defective units no problem!"
4,no decent bread so far,"I've baked 4 loaves and none of them have risen hard;y at all, and yes, i'vetried adjustments to the recipe. i'll just keep trying."
4,Good stuff (if you ignore the provided recipes),"Received this bread maker today and just made my first loaf. It's the Easy Sourdough French Bread from the Bread Baker Bible that I downloaded. Although it didn't come out quite as I expected (my sour cream was cold so it brought down the overall temperature of the mix and thus the bread didn't rise as high as it should have) the loaf is edible, delicious and the whole floor in my apartment building smells of freshly baked bread!Next is going to be banana bread with walnuts, can't wait!!!DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE RECIPES THAT COME WITH THIS BREAD MAKER !Best $45 I spent in a while :)"
5,easy to use,I find this bread machi9ne easy to use and to make a perfect loaf of bread each time. I make 2-3 loaves a week of sweet or reg bread and it has worked well each time. Takes less than 5 min to load all the ingredients and then turn it on and walk away
4,great value for your money,"i have had this machine for about 2 months, making perhaps 20 loafs of bread so far. i paid $40 for this unit at the local wallyworld. the good about this unit is the price and that it is quiet, seems to be of good quality and also is very easy to use and clean. on the downside, the manual leaves a lot to be desired. the recipes are wrong so better find recipes on the internet or buy a separate book. furthermore the unit ocupies quite a bit of kitchen real estate, and tends to brown the loafs a bit more than you would expect; i only use the lightest setting."
1,Three Strikes and you are out,"Failed three times within a once year period. The kneading pin bearing in the pan froze and would not spin. The manufacturer replaced the unit the first two times, but we threw in the towel on the third failure and decided to upgrade to a unit that could handle regular use without failing."
4,Warning -- machine may walk off counter and fall!,"This makes great bread (we use the whole wheat recipe) but the 3rd time I used it, I heard a crash. The machine had walked off our marble counter, pulled out of the outlet, and crashed on the floor breaking the lid completely. Amazon backed up the product and I have another arriving tomorrow (only ONE day without a machine - amazing). But be forewarned, the machine kneads so vigorously that it may ""travel."" I'm going to put sticky tack under the legs and turn it toward the wall, especially when we do the delay setting for overnight baking. I still wanted this same machine. Easy and inexpensive."
4,"Easy, fun and great price :-)","I bought this one after I read couple of reviews. With this price and super easy instruction you will just love this Breadmaker!! As someone already wrote in the review I recommend to use the Light Color mode especially when you try it for the first time. The very first recipe ""Homestyle White Bread 1.5-Pound Loaf"" was really ""simple but really good"" recipe. If you don't have non-fat dry milk powder just use 1 Tbsp of any milk (that worked well). Easy to clean up and highly recommended for beginners. I can't wait to try other recipes."
5,Sunbeam 5891 2-pound,I read all the reviews on the bread machines before purchasing this one and I was amazed how great the product worked for the price! I recommend this to all working women/men who like to save money on bread because it's fast and easy!
3,OK Machine,"As soon as I received the Sunbeam Breadmaker I wanted try out my favorite recipe, potato bread. It can be baked on the Expressbake setting. I was disappointed because my bread came out too compact, too doughy. The manual suggested cutting back on salt, so I tried again reducing salt by a third. Not much change. A big factor is the bake time: my old machine used 85 minutes for Expressbake. The Sunbeam uses only 58 minutes. That's a big difference, given the same recipe. I tried another recipe for Homestyle white bread, using a basic (3 hour) setting. It came out perfectly. This means all my Expressbake recipes have to be modified. A negative, in my opinion."
4,Breadmaker review,"I bought the sunbeam breadmaker a month ago. I have baked about 10 loaves ( 2 pounds each) using whole wheat flour, salt, and water in the amounts mentioned in the instruction manual. I added a 1/4 cup of gluten flour to the recepe to enhance the rise of the dough. The dough rose to the top of the pan. Now I can enjoy eating whole wheat bread with no sugar and other chemicals mixed in it. I like this product and I recommend it to anyone who likes to bake bread."
2,Too Much Heat,"I have experience with two Sunbeam bread machines. The model 5895 and 5891. The 5895 is no longer inproduction. However, the 5895 is far and away a better machine. The two 5891 units I have experience with both have had heat control problems. The newest one has to be run on the ""light"" setting as the other two settings make the bread too dark. However, I will say that the non stick coating on the tub of the 5891 is much better than that on the 5895.In addition, it seems almost impossible to see and read the display without a flashlight on the 5891. I suspect the microprogram chip on the 5891 has a software problem controlling the heat ranges. Further, I don't appreciate the fact that the price has been reduced by $10.00 since I place my order less than 30 days ago."
1,I hate this machine.,I've tried everything. I've never had a loaf come out right. It always collapses during the baking cycle. Sunbeam needs to work on their quality control issues.
2,"Cheap construction, easy to fall apart","I bought this bread machine after seeing all the positive reviews online. When I first opened the package, I was kind of disappointed. The machine itself feels like very roughly assembled, as if someone just used the glue to stick everything together and it's going to break any time soon. The metal parts were not polished neither.Anyway, disregard my slightly negative first impression, I went ahead to make bread with it. I tried most of the recipes from the manual, the outcome were only 'acceptable'. I think I made about 10 loaf of bread (within the first 2 weeks), then the metal wall on the inside of the machine start detached and there was a gap.I ended up just return the product."
1,Waste of time and money,I bought this breadmaker because of the high star rating. I received the first machine in the mail and plugged it in but it would not turn on. The machine was dead so I had to return it. The replacement came in the mail a few days later and I used that one to make a couple of loaves. Both loaves fell while cooking and then turned rock hard minutes after taking it out of the machine. I'm still in search of a decent bread machine.
2,avoid it,"I could use it two or there time properly, then it went worse. Amazon has better than this one, that is why avoid it."
1,Substandard Breadmaker,"While this is a wonderful price for a beautiful looking breadmaker, I would never recommend this piece of equipment to anyone. The ""paddle"" (according to Sunbeam that's the correct term) is way too light to stay in place for mixing and baking of the bread. Another company (Chefmate) found this flaw over 20 years ago and fixed it by making the paddle more sturdy but Sunbeam did not capitalize on this solution. Instead, (yes, I did call them direct to see if they had a solution after I found the thin ""paddle"" in the middle of my baked loaf of bread) they recognized they had a problem when they included an item similar to a crochet hook to ""fish out"" the paddle. Now that's super if you want a loaf of bread with huge holes in the middle. Sunbeam did recommend that I remove the paddle after the last mix and raise so they paddle wouldn't be in the middle while it baked - not recognizing the loaf would deflate at that point. Buyer beware - great price - lousy piece of equipment."
2,Don' like,"LED display does not light up, have to read it with a flashlight. This makes the bread machine difficult to use and inconvienient"
1,Sunbeam 5891 not worth buying,"After reading all the good reviews on it I went ahead and bought the item. Seller send it right away. The issues:- blade keeps getting stuck inside the bread.- first time only i saw the bread rise and then fall- comes out solid no matter what recipe you follow. I have had other bread machines so this is not my first rodeo. Had to buy another one because i dropped the last one and it broke.- i think it leaks steam, read several comments on it stating the same.So i returned the item and the seller accepted it."
4,Good 'ol Boy! That's Some GREAT Bread!,"What would have made this a 5 star review is if I hadn't received the package with the bread-maker upside down and a bit scratched up. It wasn't worth requesting a new one, because it did work. Still does and turns out some fantastic bread. The mixing is loud, but I can't imagine it being any quieter. Maybe as technology advances, or a more expensive machine would be quieter.Previous reviewers mentioned the recipes in the manual not tasting great. I completely agree. What has worked wonders for me is following recipes on AllRecipes.com. Every single one I have tried has turned out great. Other reviewers who complained the bread never turned out, I wonder how good their Yeast was, or if something was wrong with their model or individual machine. Because I have only experienced positive results from my bread-maker.This is my first bread-maker and I have had such a great first impression. Fantastic quality for the price. Highly recommended."
1,not happy!,"I have read some of the more positive reviews and will try some of their suggestions, but after many tries my bread consistantly comes out very heavy ( rises barely to 2/3rds up the pan) and the crust is over-cooked on the light setting. I haven't even dared to try a darker setting. I've followed all the tips - new yeast,flour etc.and the consistency of the dough looks OK. I'm not new to bread making, having made it by hand for years and with other machines. I was so disheartened I sent it back to the manufacturers and was sent another - but still have the same poor results!"
1,Motor failed after 10 loaves,"We picked up one of these unexpectedly, and were quite pleased with it initially (although the recipes that come with it aren't very good). The convenience of the machine can't be beat, and we were making bread every day. My wife started doing some whole wheat loaves, and they were quite good. Then suddenly, in the middle of a knead cycle for a whole wheat loaf, the motor started to make a grinding noise, and then it simply stopped.We assume the motor simply burned out. We hadn't changed our liquid to flour ratios, and the dough didn't seem stiffer than past loaves--the machine just gave out.Needless to say, we're quite disappointed that it failed so quickly, and now we're looking for a replacement that isn't quite so underpowered."
2,Developed drive shaft rot after 2 years,"This is a clone of the Betty Crocker BFC1690 which I purchased a little over 2 years ago for about $50. Great machine for the money for about 2 years until the upper drive shaft bearings disinegrated. The cost of a new pan would be more than a new machine. Nice throw away society we live in, huh? Oh well, it still lasts longer than an Ipod (18 months), but not as long as a Breadman(my mom has had one for for about 13 years and it still works!)"
2,Not for Heavy Duty Use,"We make a lot of whole grain breads, which typically have a stiffer dough than white bread. We used this machine about twice a week for several months. After noticing that the loaves weren't rising as well as at first, I stayed around in the kitchen and discovered that the motor was laboring and the paddle was barely turning. I made a few loaves of white bread; rising was better, but not as good as at first. One day the machine began making terrible noises and I ended up kneading by hand.Sunbeam replaced the machine, which was still under warranty. I've used the new one to make white bread, with small amounts of corn or oat flour added, with acceptable results. Yesterday I tried a loaf using half whole wheat flour, along with some white and some rye. When the motor began laboring, I stopped the machine and completed by hand.I'm now in the market for a machine with a stronger motor."
2,Paddle Shaft Becomes Loose,"The machine makes good bread when it's working. However, there was loud knocking noise during the previous bread making cycle and I added water to make it go away. One day later when I was making another batch I found the pan was leaking. The shaft became loose and the dark sealant got into my dough. There is no easy to fix it and I have to toss the pan away. The replace pan costs $30 on ebay with shipping. The machine is only in service for about a year with infrequent use. Money is saved by buying a more durable machine, not a cheaper but poorly constructed one."
1,Apparently defective motor,"I bought mine based on the reviews here; I must've gotten a lemon, because from within the first few runs the kneading motor started laboring more and more to the point where it has a hard time turning at all now. Even so it still produces bread, but the results are unpredictable. This is all with 4-cup recipes.It's noisy as some have pointed out. My bottom line: it might be worth the gamble for the low price, but keep the paperwork! The quality is not consistent between units. This one was to replace a Breadman TR555LC which burnt out after two-plus years of rugged use (operator error); might be time to go back to Breadman."
4,An Excelllant Gluton Free Baker,"A keeper. Am on Gluten Free Diet and this machine produces an excellent result with non wheat flours. I recommend the French Bread setting because of its extender kneading & baking setting for GF products. Only flaw is the lack of a lighted setting window on the control panel. Excelllant results with both boxed & scratch production. 2 loafs a week with uniform results.Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker, White"
4,"overall good, but...","It'll be nicer if it has a pause/resume button. Anyway, with the price, I am satisfied with this product."
4,First breadmaker I have owned,This is the first one I have ever used and as far as I can tell it is a good buy. I have made several loaves and cinnamon rolls and all have turned out great. I have had better luck with recipes from allrecipes.com and some other cookbooks than i have with the cookbook that came with it but I am sure that those are just basic recipes. Easy to use and straight forward instructions.
3,handy dough maker,"I bought this product for one purpose: make dough. It functions well on my purpose. But its manual has many errors or misdtatements.for example, it describe the process of making dough as working for 10 minutes and resting for 20 minutes, and then working for another 10 minutes etc. in the manual. But my machine actually continue to work for 20 minutes and rests for teh rest of 70 minutes to make dough. At first I thought something was wrong with the product so that I almost returned it."
2,Bread Pan Problems,"I used this machine for about a year until the bearing in the breadpan locked up. This part is too expensive to justify replacement, so I am looking for another machine. This machine has got me hooked on homemade bread, but one of my favorite recipes worked the motor pretty hard, and apparently was too much for the mixer bearing."
5,Great Bread maker !!!,This is a great Breadmaker.It has 10 different settings. Its worth the price and do all the necessary work.We like it very much !!!
5,Great Breadmaker!,"Always a treat when it works like it's supposed to! Great machine. Makes great bread. Machine is not too big, cleans up easily, easy to follow directions. Directions include some basic recipes so no need to buy a cookbook. If you decide to get a cookbook, I recommend Betty Crocker Best Bread Machine Cookbook."
1,"Great Expectations, but...","I purchased this breadmaker after making bread ""by hand"" for many years. It takes up a lot of room on the counter, which would be worth it if it didn't also make a loud, high-pitched sound after a few minutes of operation. I called the manufacturer, who told me I must not have cleaned it well enough before. I mentioned this was the first time I had used it. They were stumped and not helpful. Now I use the machine to mix up dough for a few minutes, then do the rest by hand. (That first loaf that was baked entirely in the breadmaker was not tasty.) I am looking for a new breadmaker and will garage sale this one, if anyone will buy it with those warnings attached."
4,Great Value!!!!,"After the belt on my Franklin Chef breadmaker broke I decided to buy another breadmaker...did a little on line research and found this model at a great price!!!(I saw it for$50.. at Walmart)It was delivered within a week of ordering although I was told it could take up to four weeks.I like it...easy to use, fairly quiet, and easy to clean. I mostly use it for dough prep; once the dough has completely risen I shape it and bake it in my oven. True..there are very few recipes in the manual but I use internet recipes sites and books from the library.I don't think you need to spend alot of money to get a good breadmaker..this one does a great job!!!!"
1,Common problem with model 5891,"I agree overall the Sunbeam 5891 Bread Machine design is fine. However there is a common parts failure I have had and upon research, others have had it too. It is in the paddle mechanism underneath the pan. There is a small plastic gasket that wears out. In my new machine it wore out within about 2 months. Once the plastic gasket wears out, the bread pan leaks and the paddle mechanism becomes lose. There is no way to replace the gasket, you just have to buy a new pan. I could no longer use the machine because the water leaks out the bottom of the pan. I have not been able to find a replacement pan easily, so I just have to buy a new machine. For this reason, I will not buy this product again, nor can I recommend it to others."
1,Disappointing product,"Although this unit appears solid and well-designed, it has some mechanical quirks and definitely lacks power. The mixing cycle inexplicably begins with 30 very short pulses of the mixing paddle. Once that has been completed, the paddle occasionally stops for a second or two during kneading for no reason ..... other than seemingly struggling to knead the dough. I contacted Sunbeam customer service and dealt with three different reps who offered no explanations for any of for the quirks although one rep sent me a new pan (made no difference). I've used the unit three times.....twice to simply knead dough and once to make a whole wheat bread. Each time, the motor was not powerful enough to knead the dough without stopping to the point of where I had to constantly open the machine and lift the ball of dough to allow the paddle to turn. This machine is disappointing. Simply a poor performer."
4,Oven suffering from delusions of grandeur,"You may as well buy this bread machine, rather than one costing five times more, because, from what I've read from other home bread bakers, they're all pretty much the same. The deficiency is kneading: not enough and so the bread crumbles easily. Since this machine remembers its stage of completion if unplugged, here's what I do. At the end of both kneading cycles, unplug the machine, remove the dough and knead by hand for at least five minutes. Then return the dough to the machine and reconnect. Second time, leave out the kneading paddle because it isn't going to be used again anyway. All of that notwithstanding, I am about to switch to hand methods and bake in a gas grill outside (to keep desert heat out of the house). Check out [...]for great alternatives, suchc as no-knead recipes."
1,Manual has many mistakes,"As far as I know, the breadmaker itself works fine, but the manual to the machine has many inconsistencies. For instance, in the beginning of the book it says the bread pan is dishwasher safe. Later, it says it isn't. The recipes are all wrong too. Mostly on the yeast amounts. For instance, the recipe will call for more yeast on a 1.5 pound loaf than for a 2 pound loaf of the same bread. I have been in contact with Sunbeam regarding this and I was told that they are aware of the problems with the manual but have chosen not to rewrite a manual at this time. Later another employee told me they are working on it. I took mine back to Walmart today and am on Amazon shopping for another brand. I would not buy this machine. As I said, I think the machine is probably fine, but you need a decent manual to give you instructions on use and care of the machine as well as recipes that are reliable."
1,If you like bricks,"We have used our new Sunbeam for 5 or 6 weeks now and NOT ONCE have we been able to extract a nicely risen loaf from this machine. Fresh flour, fresh yeast, fresh everything, but every time when the bread starts to bake the loaf collapses. For two decades the same recipe worked very well in our old Regal Kitchen Pro machine. We have added more water, reduced water, added yeast, reduced yeast, all to no avail. The bread always comes out as a little brick."
5,Economical and Awsome!,"After missing my old bread maker I got rid of a long time ago, looked for a new one. This bread maker fits every bill PLUS some! I've made about 5 loaves & lots of dough, with wonderful results. I have not tried the cake or jam settings yet. High quality features in a non~expensive model.My family loves the bread that comes straight out of the machine, and also when I make a variety of doughs to free form or shape my loaves into whatever I want to make. Easy to use, simple, & easy to clean. The paddle kneading blade is also metal and non~stick coated, and the loaves slip out with no ""rips"" on the bottom. A nice feature. Makes a tasty 1.5 pound loaf, or a big 2 pound one! Best bang for my buck. Highly recommended."
5,A great bread machine,"I got this model to replace an older Sunbeam that finally wore out. The new one is as dependable as the old one. It does a great job on whole wheat bread, which is what we mostly use it for.The size of the baking ""bucket"" has changed and that makes the bread easier to use for a sandwich.I've used two of the older model machines for some time and was pleased with them. I'm looking forward to using this one for some time.I wish the replacement baking ""buckets"" were cheaper, though, because that's all my older model needs to become a working machine again."
3,Problems with drive spindle,The bushing on the drive spindle gave out today. There had been problems with the spindle not wanting to turn for some time. Probably still the best buy in a bread machine. I used it a lot. It cooked a little too hot.
3,This breadmaker is economic,This breadmaker is economic. However its mixing and baking functions are just so so. I don't know wheather the expensive ones can do better jobs.
1,Sunbeam Breadmaker Model 5891,"This machine was good while it lasted. Unfortunately the motor no longer turns the paddle. So....it lasted 4 years. I hate throwing away a whole machine but there is no other option. No replacement parts except the paddle. I quit eating bread for about 2 years, so it really only lasted about 2 years!!!"
1,Return warning!!!,Be careful if you return this item. They may shipit to you free but you will be out $16 to returnit!!!!!!!!
3,surprisingly large,it occupied too much space. arrived in a boxed obviously opened before. I returned it.
1,i hate it,"I don't know why others wrote a positive review on this product,I purchased this product and it stop working from the next day,I am too lazy to return this product and I swear not to purchase any home appliance or any electrical things from website, I am from United Arab Emirates and it costs me a lot for shipment if I will return it back to the supplier,"
2,breadmaker,"The product is not reliable. It does not always shut off automatically and does not heat evenly, making the loaves lopsided."
4,Time-saving Great Bread Machine,"At first I was unsure about the low price and the fact that it is a Sunbeam. I have owned this for about a month and I love it! I like to cook and make bread, but my time lately has been limited. This machine is great! I make a quick bread and 1-2 loaves of bread a week. I have no bowls, utensils and bread boards to cleanup...just some measuring spoons and the easy non stick bread machine pan."
4,Easy to use Bread Maker,This is an excellent bread maker at a great price. The unit has a streight forward user LCD menu system. Compaired to other bread makers that our family has had this one takes up much less counter space and its operation is very quite. The user printed manual is marginal at best.
4,good dependable bread maker,"Have been very satisfied with bread made in this machine. Wish it had a louder signal when bread is done, though. No booklet was in box, but a call to customer service brought one in less than 10 days."
4,"Affordable, decent breadmaker","We haven't bought a loaf of bread at the store since buying this little machine a few months ago. So far, it's worked quite well. Even whole grain bread usually rises and turns out pretty well without any modifications to the cycle. Certainly, nothing has broken yet. We were so impressed with the value for the price that we bought one for my parents as a gift. If you're looking for a good bread machine on a budget, this is the way to go."
4,Works very well and produces beautiful loafs of bread,"This is a very easy to use bread machine that simpy works great. Make sure you follow the instructions it comes with and you will not be disappointed. It lucks some of the more advanced features of more expensive machines but for the price, you can't go wrong with this one."
5,An amazing product,"My wife and I were skeptical about this product in general, but we love fresh bread. We have now tried several of the recipes, including ExpressBake and we must say we love it! It consistently bakes a loaf of bread that is very good and certainly beats anything we can get at a local store. Best of all, it does it with minimum effort on our part. Highly recommended."
4,great machine,does a great job. even baking consistent loaves. only small problem is the paddle sticks in the nmachine. not a big issue just soak bread pan and paddle loosens up.
4,Bakes Bread,"Bread maker seems to do all it is suppose to. Nice loafs come out. One thing though, it has NO Gluten baking setting, which is becoming a bigger issue these days."
2,Defective Rotating Blade,"This one is a replacement.The rotating (blade) part will onlyslide half way throught the littlerod in the baking pan.If you see through the hole you can tellthat something sticks out and needs someserious scraping.I've had bread makers in the past.I know how they fit.Tried to call the company but ...no personto talk to. The automation did not even have anoption for problems.If they don't have time to help me, I have tomake time to keep returning their products at theirown expense."
5,Perfect bread maker,"Easy to make fresh bread with this machine, and my bread-snob European wife loves the bread. I don't measure very accurately and still get great results every time, so that dispels what others say about being precise in measurements. I spend just five minutes to add ingredients (regular flours and yeast, nothing special or costly). My sister has a $300 machine and gets same results I do."
1,When the drive belt breaks you have to junk the breadmaker,"I used this breadmaker for four years without problems. Then the drive belt snapped. I wrote to Sunbeam asking for a replacemnt. Their answer was:""The belt is not a replaceable part for this model"".So now I cannot fix my breadmaker and I have to junk it."
3,Good bread sometimes,"Not very impressed and returned it, the bread was hit and miss. It didn't matter if I used fresh bought flour and yeast, sometimes it rose and sometimes not."
2,Worked good until it quit....,"I liked the machine until it completely quit.. .the belt got ""stuck"" or something and it wouldn't knead. My husband took it apart to see if he could fix it/get a new part for it. He looked everywhere online to try and buy a new belt for it but couldn't find one. I didnt have it that long before this happened so I was bummed."
4,Sunbeam Breadmaker,"it's cheap, it's a no frill breadmaker but it works, that's how i look at it.It would be nice to have a bit more of options, like choosing the cooking time, but machines that possibly offer that belong to a different range of price.Still, the bread this machine makes it quite good (I'm Italian so my standards are high) and in a few months the machine basically pays itself with the money you save.I definitely recommend it as an affordable but quality choice."
5,The power of bread for less then $50,I love the bread maker. I have made about 10 different kinds of loaves in it over the last three weeks. All the verities have been tasty and fun for my family to make. Everyone loves fresh bread and the way my house smells when we are baking it. The machine is so simple to use and easy clean up my husband can do it. I hope it lasts for years.
5,great bread machine!,I bought this bread machine when my 15+ year old one died. I am very happy with the quality. I use it mainly to make dough for yeast rolls. So glad I did not spend $150.00 on my other choices.
3,Partially pleased.,"2 Pound Sunbeam Programmable Breadmaker #5891. I agree with a previous comment in that it is too large, so finding a storage/freezer container/bag is somewhat challanging. It is also hard to slice since I don't have an electric knife. One slice is about equal to about two regular slices of bread. I believe some of the instructions in the recipes are repeated. It would be nice if the buttons would light up or some way to show the current process as my previous maker. The bread is tasty. They could put more healthy recipes in manual, like rye breads, etc., not necessarily party faire."
5,Review of the Sunbeam 5891 Breakmaker,I am extremely happy with this breadmaker. I have used it about every week since I purchased it. I highly recommend this product.
2,Disappointing,"Although it comes with an excellent booklet, giving all types of tips to ensure a good loaf...and step by step instructions, the machine is a ""toy."" It vibrates during the kneading cycle, causing the unit to shake visibly. None of the loaves of French bread have come out properly. On the ""light"" color, the bread is not done, and the top is not fully cooked. I kept it because I threw away the box, and will still use it for white bread and dough cycle."
4,Enjoy,I am enjoying this bread maker to the fullest. It is quite and make the best bread. i love the dough mode and make a lot of bread sticks. Enjoy
5,A REIEW OF MY BREADMAKER PURCHASE..,"I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH MY SUNBEAM PROGRAMMABLE BREADMAKER. I MADE THREE LOAVES OF BREAD THE DAY IT ARRIVED AND THEY WERE DELICIOUS. I AM 85 YEARS OLD AND FOUND THAT USING THE MACHINE WAS VERY EASY, THAT AND THE FAIR PURCHASE PRICE MADE IT AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE. THE ART OF MAKING ""HOMEMADE"" BREAD HAS BECOME SO SIMPLE THAT ANYONE CAN DO IT. THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT.R. FREEBURG"
2,Good for kneading,"Works great for a couple of months as a kneader. Watch out, though, it will leave gray streaks in the dough, and you can't replace any of the bread machine parts. Try the Panasonic instead if you want to bake; you can replace parts, too, when it fails, which is normal from use. In other words, you get what you pay for!"
4,It works for us,"We really like this breadmaker that we purchased from Amazon.com. It took several weeks to figure out whether medium crust or light crust was best, and we have had to adjust to using rapid rise yeast since breadmaker yeast isn't available in our small town. We also bought the Betty Crocker Bread Maker Bread Book, and that has expanded our options. Overall, the product exceeds our expectations and my husband has become the primary baker in the house. The wonderful smell of baking bread now happens several times a week."
3,nearly unreadable display,"Had to get on my knees to view digital display, with difficulty.Never did see loaf size display.Using for first time as I write this. Therefore, do not know outcome. But, not happy with the product at this time. Not my first breadmaker and far from my first bread.A person in the 70's should not have to get on their knees in attempt to read digital display.Instruction book should duplicate actual display.Steps should be acurate and readable."
2,LOUD!,"Wow! This bread maker is LOUD. Also, it could be operator error, but the texture of the bread is not tasty. The house smelled nice though."
1,This is the Worst Breadmaker on the Market,I had use my my sister's Sunbeam for several days and I can tell you this doesn't even come close to the bread I can get from my 2 Zo's. Save your money and buy a better one!
1,minus 10 if I could do it,"PIECE OF JUNK....AFTER 10 POUNDS OR SO OF FLOUR AND ALL THE OTHER INGREDIENTS, TRYING EVERY THING POSSIBLE I STILL NEVER GOT A DECENT LOAF OF BREAD. THE MACHINE IS GOING BACK...DON'T BUY ONE!!!!!"
1,I should have followed the advise,I have purchased a Sunbeam 5891. The first time I made a loaf of bread the machine stopped before the final bake. I had to finish it in the oven. I tried it again and the same thing happend. Well I will not boar you any more. The fourth time the machine would not even start (after I put all of the ingredients in of course) I could hear a slight hum and no lights NOTHING. I have tried to get on the web site and tried to look up FAQ's there is none. I have emailed twice and have not got a answer back yet. There is a 800 # and of course I can not seem to get any one. (I hate automated things). I thought that Sunbeam was a good brand???????????????
2,bread machine with problems,"Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable BreadmakerThis breadmaker arrived with a broken lid. At first I thought it was up to me to attach it. After several of us tried to attach it with no success, I called Sunbeam. The customer service lady was very helpful. ""The lid is broken. You should have called us right away. We'll send you another bread machine, brand new. Keep this broken machine; we don't want it."" (Sunbeam sent me an OSTER bread machine that is exactly like my old Sunbeam with a few newer features.)So now I have two bread machines that work. The first one I received is waiting for the Salvation Army."
5,Love this Sunbeam,"I have had one like this for years, and it still works great, I bought two more one for a gift for my daughter and another one for me, knowing my old one won't last forever, and wanted to stick to a winner, and the parts would be interchanable if needed. I use mine about twice a week using the express recipes, bread in 57 minutes and its great. I use whole wheat, ground flaxseed and oatmeal in a version of the oatmeal date bread express recipe, sometimes using craisins instead of dates, but mostly without either. I use it for toast mostly, so good when its fresh with butter or olive oil, or for a great sandwich. I cut the big loaves in half lengthwise and freeze half the loaf. My 13 yr old grandson has been working my daughters alot since they got it, he likes to make homemade pizza's using the dough recipe. I keep mine in a kitchenette in the basement so I don't have to put it away.I buy yeast and flour in bulk at Sams club. Its a Winner!"
5,Love the sunbeam breadmaker,"So far we've had this for about two month, been using it very week to make breads. Fairly easy to follow the instructions and the bread is pretty good."
5,Easy Breadmaker,I make bread often and this is easy to use. I actually only use it for mixing the dough however. I do the shaping and baking in the oven so I can't rate how it actually bakes a loaf.
5,Works perfect!,This is a great bread maker. I've made several loafs without any problems and the time delay option works perfectly so I have warm fresh bread in the morning when I wake up. I've also made several batches of jam (strawberry and peach) and it has turned out delicious every time!!! I bought this due to the reviews and the decent price and now that I own one I highly recommend this bread maker. I've been using it almost every day since I bought it and have loved the performance of the machine. Haven't really tried the recipes in the book that came with it I've just used recipes I've found online.
1,Save your money,"I needed a new bread machine and ended up getting this one because it was cheap. I'm not demanding and don't need my machine to make jam and rice or anything fancy. Just bake me a good loaf of bread every once in a while. I like to bake whole grain breads and my first 3 three loaves came out like bricks. Burned bricks. I made changes - no luck. Finally, I broke down and made a loaf with regular bread flour. It's overly dense and just as badly burned, even though I used the 'light' crust setting. I'm not going to set a timer to take the bread out 15 minutes early. The machine should be able to manage on its own.Spend a little more on a better machine."
4,very easy to use,very easy to use. you put in everything and the machine do the rest. then you just enjoy your freshmade bread!onlything a bit confusion is the recipes. seems not all the quantities are correct.
1,Poor quality,"The Sunbeam that I received is poorly made. When closed, there is a wide gap between cover and bottom part. I used it to make bread once. The bread was dry and the top of the bread collapsed which is probably due to the fact the machine doesn't close tightly. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to others."
1,Falling Loaves,"I bought this machine over a year ago. It was my fourth bread machine and I have never had trouble making bread before. My first loaf fell and left me with a badly textured loaf that went straight into the trash after the first unappetizing slice. I thought I must have made a mistake measuring. Then my second loaf fell. I was so discouraged, I did not touch the machine for several months. Then I read the complete troubleshooting section of the manual and tried again -- still my bread fell. All in all, I made about six loaves of bread, each cratered. I got the machine cheap and so just tossed it in the trash with the final loaf."
5,Great machine,"This was my first bread machine so I didn't know how the bread would turn out. I followed the directions for the white bread, it tasted great, but the top fell. The whole wheat did the same thing, looked good till the top fell. I found a great receip on the internet, where you add the warm water FIRST, then the sugar,& the yeast, cover & wait 10 minutes. You then add the flour and the rest.The bread never has fallen, I have tried the basic white bread, whole wheat, carrot & raisin bread, and a vanallia sour cream bread. This goes against what Sunbeam says in the book, but it works for me. Now everyone wants a loaf of fresh bread, I also tried the dough cycle, & made cinnamon raisin rolls. This from a guy who burns pizza ! The wire hook is for pulling out the paddle, if it stays in the bread. I now spray Pam on the paddle and it stays in the basket."
3,Sunbream breadmaker so-so,"Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable BreadmakerI bought this particular machine on the recommendations in Amazon but am a little disappointed with its performance. I've tried many different recipes, both in the recipe book that came with the machine and a great gourmet breadmachine recipe book that turned out perfect bread loaves on my last machine, but all so far have resulted in bread that is both too heavy and falls after rising. All recipes have been followed exactly. I have also tried reducing the amount of yeast/increasing flour because I live at high altitude, but it hasn't made a difference. The bread tastes fine- it just doesn't produce a well-risen loaf."
1,loaves that fall dramatically!,"Hard to understand how no-one else here seems to have had a problem with their bread falling with this machine! I've been baking forty years and have also used (and worn out) two other bread machines, and have never had this problem before. Every, and I mean Every loaf falls soon after the bake cycle begins. They don't just fall a little, they look like a bowl! I've tried everything and every recipe and all fall. I'm an experienced baker, I've baked thousands of loaves. I've never had anything like this in the past. It isn't just an occasional loaf that does this, it's every single one. I've had this since June and have finally given up. I've written to the company hoping they have a recall or something for a fix."
1,The non-stick surface comes off.,Update: The unit is 3 months old now. This is unacceptable. After this short time the non-stick coating on the bread pan is coming off. Had to throw it away. The chemical non-stick coatings are highly toxic. I never touched the surface with any utensil except a wooden spoon.Another thing I bought it from Amazon for $47 they now want over $70 for it.If you value your health don't buy this.
4,Excellent Bread Maker,"It is very easy to use and clean. The ""Bake"" only function allows me to bake my cakes without heating up the entire oven. That is very convenient.The only issue, is that the recipes that come with the bread maker are wrong. It took me about 1 week to get the right ingredients. I found good bread recipes on King Arthur's web site: [...] (that's why I'm giving it only 4 stars)."
2,Disappointed * wrote to Sunbean and got satisfaction,"I have missed having a breadmaker and could hardly wait to make my first loaf. First loaf I made looked like it had a bowl shaped depression on the top. I thought, I must have done something wrong, bought all new flour, yeast everything. Same thing happened with my next loaf. I came back here to check the reviews and saw that others had the same exact problem.**I wrote to Sunbeam about my problems, told them I had never gotten even one good loaf out of this machine and they wrote back and told me they are sending me a new one and hope I have better success. I have read a LOT of good reviews about this machine so I decided to try this route before tossing it in the trash. So glad I contacted the company."
4,great for the price,"For the price, you can't go wrong. I've used it about 7 or 8 times (over 2 months) and have been quite happy. The first use, I baked a loaf of white bread, turned out nice. Since then, I've only used it for dough setting and then baked the bread in the oven. I've done a french loaf recipe and made baguettes, a couple of round loaves, pizza dough a few times (great pizza dough!) and cinnamon rolls. I've gotten all my recipes online b/c the recipe book included is a little lame. I give it 4 stars b/c I'm not crazy about the non-stick lining in the pan (kind of toxic smelling when it bakes). That's why I'm doing the baking part in the oven."
5,Good breadmaker for good price,"I bought it for my wife, and it seems to me she is very happy to bake very good bread for me. Good bread maker for good price."
3,GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE DOUGH,"This was close to the cheapest breadmaker I found when trying to replace my 15 year old West Bend Homestyle after the heating element went out. The price and the fact it makes 2 pound loaves are the positive features. The provided recipes are erroneous, but through experiment and old recipes I have managed to get some pretty good bread, and expect it will be better. The electronic screen is dark, tiny and I need glasses to read it.The pan handle is very flimsy, so I have to grip the sides to remove it. The instructions for insertion of the pan are inaccurate, but the instructions actually on the breadmaker corrected that.I just got it a few weeks ago, so we will see how it holds up"
4,they want me to review a purchase for something,"I've used only four times on regular, dough and whole wheat settings. Worked great so far but ask me in 6 months. I took away a star because there seems to me a bit of cheap build to it but hey, if it continues to make excellent bread for so little money....."
5,"excellent, just what I wanted","My old Breadman brand machine began to leak last month and became useless. I checked the reviews for a simple bread machine. I mostly use it for the dough setting only. This Sunbeam had high reviews, so I bought it. I've now made several loaves of various breads and am completely satisfied so far."
2,"Whoa Nelly, dead duck after one flight","First loaf of bread was great, second loaf got past the dough making stage and the machine is now beeping ad nauseum, with no apparent way of turning off the alarm or establishing what is causing the failure.Whenever I plug the machine back in, I hear a very sick sounding whizz, and then the alarm kicks in and the screen displays Err$40 loaf of bread was good, but I had higher hopes"
5,Sunbeam Bread Machine,"This is a great machine! The only thing missing is the add nuts and fruit beeper but that's not a problem. I just set the timer on the stove to go off when it's time to add whatever. I like the larger size pan when I just make dough. Probably what I like best is the improvement in getting the pan out, it's so much easier than the older model. There's a little tool to remove the beater from the hot bread, sure saves burned fingers.If you like using a bread machine this is the one tho have!"
3,Sunbeam 5891 2-pound breadmaker,"The machine was bought to replace an older Sunbeam breadmaker which served me very well for 10 years until a heating element failed. The new Sunbeam breadmaker makes very good bread; however, it is more difficult to program than the older model, takes up more counter space, and the ""message window"" is hard to read without a flashlight. The breadpan with this new machine is very hard to position on the rotor and the pan is difficult to remove without twisting and rocking it. Sunbeam has informed me that this is normal."
2,It broke after 3 months,"This was our first bread maker. Its a vertical bread maker. the heat was not evenly distributed when baking the bread. It did make decent bread. The belt broke after 3 months. Send it bake to Sunbeam and waiting for a replacement or the fix. not a durable product, spend more and get a better product"
5,A great beginners Breadmaker!,"I purchased the Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Peogrammable Breadmaker as a Christmas present to myself. Honestly, for the price, I didn't expect much, but this is a great breadmaker! I love it! It took only a few minutes to start my loaf of bread following the ultra easy directions in the enclosed booklet. The machine was a little bit noisy during the ""kneading"" cycles, but this is no big deal. The bread came out perfect! I would suggest using the light color selection though. I am happy that I puchased this breadmaker, and would highly recommend it to friends and family who are interested in buying a breadmaker."
5,It's a nice machine !,"I bought this machine a month ago. So far I have made 8 nice and tasty loaves. Now my family only eat the fresh breads I made, we stop buying bread from the store. The machine is easy to use and reliable. It's a great value for the money."
5,Best yet,This is the best bread machine I've had so far~I've had it over a year and it hasn't let me down yet and is very easy to use~
4,Breadmaker,I continue to make excellent whole wheat bread with this machine and would recommend it to anyone.
1,Don't Do It !,"I did some research on the web about bread machines before my purchase, and I decided on this Sunbeam model as a nice balance between cost, simplicity, and reliability. This particular model turned out to be a total bust once I tied it. I attempted to make several loaves, and none of them turned out. I tried tweaking the recipe in case the user manual was off, but no luck, so I returned it...."
5,Great Product,"First thing I noticed when I received the Breadmaker was the packaging There was no sign of damage.From the quality of the packaging, it would take a lot of abuse to cause damage.I have been making various breads for a number of years. This is my first Breadmachine purchaseUnpacked, the machine was perfect, no signs of poor quailty. I followed the cleaning instructions.I then made the first test loaf according to the instructions being careful to be exactThe bread came out perfect Actually better than I made by hand. The second loaf came out perfect and the quality between to 2 loafs wre almost identical.Wish I would have bought this machine years ago."
4,"Good Bread, But I am Returning for Horizontal Pan","This made a very good bread. I bought it to make sandwich loaves. The sandwich setting is great. Unfortunately, with this being my sole purpose for this machine, I am returning it for a horizontal loaf model. (West Bend Hi-Rise 41300) The sandwich bread was very tall and far to big for my kids to eat for lunch. I worried that this would happen when I read the reviews. The horizontal pan makes a more traditional loaf for my purposes. The machine was quiet and did not walk the counter. I really liked the quick setting as it made an incredible dense yummy bread that I really liked. If I was making loaves for dinner or breakfast consumption, this machine would have been great. A great price too. I had to pay double for a horizontal loaf model, but have had very good results from that."
2,great machine until the bread pan fell apart,I make bread about once a week and have worked with several brands of bread machines over the past few years. The Sunbeam 5891 has a lot of power and is really easy to work with but the bread pan mechanism is held together with cheap plastic parts and breaks easily. The plastic breaks and then the metal spoke that holds the paddle in place comes undone and you are left with an unuseable bread pan with a hole in the bottom. It's not repairable and Sunbeam couldn't care less. The replacement pan sells for $28.18 before shipping and tax which is more than half the cost of an entire new machine.
4,Does what it supposed to,"Purchased this breadmaker about a month ago, made some bread (about 4 loaves) and pizza dough. The machine worked as advertised, i.e. it made bread and dough. Some vibration present during kneading, but that is expected, I like the fact that the pan is locked at the bottom and not by two flimsy tabs on the sides as some other machines are, less things to break later. The first loaf of bread fell but the subsequent loaves came out looking great, the trick here is to use bread flour instead of plain white, I think. The pizza dough came out really good. I would recomend this machine to people who don't do fancy breadmaking but make about 1 or 2 loaves a week. It is 1/4 of the price of the fancier machines and does the job that it is made to do.Gave it 4 stars because I only had it for short period of time. Don't know how well it will work after a year yet."
3,Good Machine for the Price,"I don't make bread with complicated recipes, so this machine serves my purpose. I have had the machine for about 6 years, and I bake bread once a week. The only complaint I have is the short life of the bread pan. After 2-3 years of baking at the above rate, the shaft started to seize up. I got it turning each time using force. Eventually the paddle started scraping the bottom of the pan, causing some black-looking pan material to appear in the bread. Not good. So if you are willing to order a new pan (~$30 incl. shipping) after about 2 years, this machine is for you. Maybe other brands have a similar pan life - I don't know."
5,Very Easy To Use!,"I purchased this breadmaker to make heart healthy bread since I am now on a low sodium diet. I had never used a breadmaker before I bought this one but I found that as long as you follow the directions, the bread that you make comes out perfect. There is a book of instructions and a few recipes that come with the breadmaker. I live in a hot, humid climate during the summer and I have had to learn that when the humidity and heat are high, I have to make a couple of changes to my bread recipes so that the bread does not collapse. I found that lowering the amount of yeast in a bread recipe (about 1/4 teaspoon) and about 2 tablespoons less of water helps keep the bread from collapsing during this type of weather. I should be able to go back to the original amounts listed in the recipe during the fall and winter. Otherwise, all of the bread recipes that I have made come out perfect and delicious! The bread is better for me since I know exactly what goes in it."
2,Short Life Machine,"After 3 years of use, it died last night!!Good for dough setting.Ok for bread setting. The bread shell was always too hard and too dark even with light setting.Good bye machine!"
5,Excellent Breadmaker. Very Consistent.,This breadmaker always creates a good product. Easy to use controls and creates a wonderful aroma. We make bread at least twice a week now.
2,Sorry I bought it.,I gave it to my daughter in law for Christmas. She took it home and made bread that night. She set the timer and it baked but so tough you couldn't eat it.
1,Defective out of box,"This product did not work out of the box.Assembled as instructed.Machine made noises and got warm, but did not knead dough.Replacement ordered...will alter this review if different."
4,Good Product,"Although I've used it only once so far, this bread maker seems to be very satisfactory. I prefer the loaf shape to the round one that we previously had. I hope to get many years of good use out of this bread machine."
4,Sunbeam Breadmaker,"Product arrived in new condition. Have used it twice...first time bread over-rose, second time was perfect...used two different recipes! I am satisfied but wish it came with more recipes that used all purpose flour. (went on the internet for these)."
1,You can't get a replacement belt for it anywhere!!!,When the Sunbeam 5891 bread maker which has been used about a dozen times quit working I discovered the belt was destroyed. Every place I checked including Sunbeam service centers stated that a replacement belt is not available anywhere. I really hate to throw it away but what else can you do? I would NEVER buy another Sunbeam.
5,"easy, tasty!",Bought this bread machine for my son. He loves it. He says it is very easy to operate and makes a very tasty loaf of bread. He has had no problems at all with it or the quality of bread it puts out
4,Sunbeam Breadmaker,"On the plus side, the breadmaker bakes well, accommodates a 1-1/2 to 2 lb. loaf, has settings for personal preference of light, medium, dark crust. On the down side, the machine's a bit bulky and the digital settings are NOT as easy to see as advertised. Red, blue or green numbers on the readout would have been helpful. But overall, a good machine."
2,Not such a good deal...,"I thought I got a good deal on this.. and, at first it worked just fine..but after about a dozen loaves..all my bread came out hard as a rock (yes, a rock). It collapsed in the middle and totally dried up. These were the same recipes that worked fine at first and I tried everything I could think of to fix it..like check and double check my recipes..etc. I even did the yeat test on my yeast.. finally gave up and returned it.. Disappointing!!!!"
4,Bread Machine,I have used my bread machine for rolls and pizza dough and I love it. I use recipes of my own that I get from [...]. I have not tried the recipes that come with the machine.
2,Not That Great,"I got this machine a few years ago. It worked great at first, but it soon made weird grinding noises. Not to mention that when I have it on a full bread cycle, the bread rises and the collapses leaving a nice big hole in the middle of the loaf. Lately, I have to use it only to make dough and then bake it in my oven. So it's really only a dough machine now. If you're looking for a really good bread machine that will last, I don't recommend this one."
4,Sunbeam 5891 2-pound breadmaker,"This machine can make a two-pound loaf of 100% whole wheat bread! And you don't have to add any white bread flour to thin it down! The texture was perfect on my first try and it sliced easily without crumbling. My area's high elevation will necessitate some recipe modifications because the top caved in, but it didn't affect the texture or taste at all. The machine will also make a 1-1/2-pound loaf. I'm eager to try some more sophisticated whole wheat recipes."
2,"Not so ""hot"".","I bought this machine from Walmart a few days ago. I've tried making several loaves in it and despite following the recipes in the book and ""better"" recipes posted online I've had every single one fall and turn into a bread cup (huge crater in the top). This appears to happen as soon as the machine enters its baking cycle. If I take the dough out, put it in a pan, let it rise and bake it in the oven no such problems occur. So, If you're looking for a machine to knead and rise dough, then this machine will work. For a while. The last two loaves (we're talking white loaves, not dense wheat) I've had it knead and rise for me have caused the machine to make this really loud noise. It sounds like two plastic gears are slipping against each other. It still runs, but I can't imagine it will continue to do so for long. I'm returning it and doing a little more research before I buy another brand"
5,Great Machine,We have consistently liked the brown bread our Sunbeam breadmaker has produced for us (when we get the recipe right!). It seems like a great machine.
1,Sunbeam 5891 Breadmaker,"Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable BreadmakerI purchased this machine after having used a Sunbeam machine that my mother had. I was not impressed with this machine. It has more buttons that the old machine, but it is not as good. Even when I follow the recipe to the last drop of liquid or grain of flour the bread is always dry and hard. I have tried all the tricks of adding butter instead of oil, adding water by the spoonful and it just dosn't work right. I have tried other recipies from the net and they are not much better. I wish I had the old machine. I only use the machine for mixing the dough."
2,disappointed,The machine did not meet my expectations. I tried three times to make the basic bread with poor results. My old machine does a much better job and I make several bread varieties. I returned the machine for a refund.
4,So far so good,"Not too bad. I'm getting some great loaves out of it, but I do hope it lasts for a while. We had to return the first order because the hinge on the lid was cracked upon arrival. Bread is great, but I'd advise extreme care when handling the machine."
5,First bread machine,I love this machine. I use it about once a week to make fresh bread. I've used the dough settings with great success.
1,Ripping itself apart,"I bought this machine because it had great reviews here on Amazon. One of the reviews I read mentioned a bad ""clunking"" noise. I thought since most of the reviews were positive, it must just have been a dud. If so, then the one I got was a dud also. I use the machine occasionally and it does it's job, but sounds like it has stripping gears inside (I expect it is a ribbed belt jumping a gear). I honestly don't expect it to last very long. Don't be fooled by the price, it's not worth the money, even at a low price."
1,Clunky bread machine,"This machine is unstable when kneading dough. It knocks, clangs and moves about the counter. Ours jumped off the counter and fell to the floor, breaking the lid off. The baking pan doesn't lock as securely as it should.The recipes provided are very limited and focus on white flour, almost exclusively."
1,"Oops, I did it again....","This is a follow up to my last review. I ordered a new machine, received a 'used' one. I was sent a replacement machine and guess what? It was also used.I had very good experiences with Amazon in the past. I won't buy any appliances from them again."
2,Refurbished unit,"Ordered it new, for whatever reason I was sent a refurbished unit. This is obvious from various use marks on the unit's kneading paddle (including what looked to be a piece of burnt-on bread), misalignment of the lid, and scratches on the clear plastic due to the absence of the plastic coating that is always present on the clear-plastic part of new machines.Returned for refund."
3,Warning - possible hazard!,"This is my second bread machine in 8 years. This one has only lasted about 2 years but there is a serious problem. It leaks - around the paddle, liquid and even soft bread dough slowly leaks out. Personally, I prefer to only use bread machines to knead and the first rising. I then bake in the oven. I have used this to make a huge variety of breads and artisan breads and it does that quite well. But, yikes, I suspect that it would be a bit dangerous to have the liquid near the heating coils. I suppose I should contact the company."
4,"Very good product, great for the money","Had never had a breadmaker and when I checked out Amazon and their shipping-free offer, I read the reviews on their breadmakers. Although the Sunbeam was low in price, the reviews were very high, so I bought it. I'm very pleased. The only thing you have to do once it starts kneading is to open the top to clear the corners and bottom of what it misses. You also have to check if the dough is moist enough and add water accordingly.I haven't tried using it for anything other than plain white bread, but am looking forward to using it for just the kneading part.I also wanted to buy a ""bread keeper"" but didn't like what I read in the reviews so I went to my favorite discount store and bought a $6 plastic box with a vacuum valve on top. Perfect size for these loaves. You also need to have a good bread knife--I have a cheap one and it tears the bread!(Suggestion to Amazon to group these products together and sell as a package.)I highly recommend this bread machine!"
3,NOT SURE YET,My First try was not a good success So we are hoping for the 2nd time to have a good result and if not we will return.
3,"Nice, but not great",This breadmaker only seems to work if you use the recipes in the booklet (which are limited) that comes with it without deviating even a little. You may also need to use a plastic knife to make sure that everything gets mixed properly as well. I have tried multiple recipes for breadmakers from other sources and almost none of them have turned out well. The only recipes from other sources that have turned out well were for banana bread.
1,Awful Results,"We used this bread maker 3 times and the results were awful! The first loaf was doughy in the middle and burned on the outside. Despite having fresh ingredients, we bought all new just to make sure that was the issue. Same results for loaves 2 and 3, so the machine was sent back. We have used the recipes countless times before with no issues and the ingredients were fresh, so it was clearly the fault of the machine. I would not even consider this machine unless you want the hassle of returning it."
1,smokin,"I bought this at Walmart, and got it home. Used it 2 times, both times it started smoking, and the top started to burn. taking it back. Won't try another."
2,Good price but Not worth it!,"i have been using bread machines for years, i also make my own bread. i do not buy bread ever these days, i make all bread and rolls for my household. So, i wanted a second breadmaker (i had a panasonic bread bakery alreday, and i use it 2-3 times a week and absolutely love it. after returning this one, i bought a new panasonic)i got this BM just becuase it was so cheap, and it really does have lots of options that the other newer machines have. i saw the bad reviews and some good ones so i gave it a try. truthfully, i only made one loaf, which failed as expected so i returned it (bought locally) . i used the correct ingredients but the loaf was hard & flat.the other thing i do not like about this loaf is that you have to add the ingredients in a particular order, so the yeasat doesnt get moistened until it should, but this is a fussy method for a machine. the panasonic has a patented yeast dispenser which has never failed me!!good luck in your bread making."
4,Caution if using overseas,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and she loved it, and the bread she made was amazing. It worked great for about four loaves of bread and then it died. I am in the Army and we are currently stationed in Germany. The Army housing has 220v and 110v outlets so we plugged it in to the 110v and it worked. The problem is the 110 here is not on the same phase or something (not sure about the technicals) as it is in the States so it burned out the motor. Half way through a loaf of bread the motor seized up. It's a good bread machine but just be forewarned if you plan on using it somewhere other than the USA that it might not have a long and happy bread-filled life."
4,So far so good.,"We have only had this machine for about 3 weeks. We have only had the opportunity to use it one time. The one time it worked very well. The only issue we had so far was that we used the wrong kind of Flour and the bread fell. It was very good none the less. I like that you can set it over night and wake up to nice fresh bread or cinnamon bread. Be warned the liner of the pan is very very fragile and scratches easily. I gently used a metal off set spatula to remove the bread. It scratched the liner pretty bad in a couple places. It was not a good idea for me to have used it (wife was not happy with me lol). I should have known better but now it is like the laundry when I shrunk all the sweaters, I don't have to do laundry anymore either. As to the machine so far so good."
4,good machine,"Works fine.The # 1 setting works best for me.I bake bread just about every week ,and 95% of the times the bread comes out perfectly shaped."
3,8 months,"This bread maker worked great, for 7 and a half months. Then it started knocking, and now it just don't work. We make bread about every other day so that would be about 150 loaves before it died. I am feeling a little let down by how many products are just not designed to be used everyday."
3,Haven't gotten it to make my sourdough recipe yet,"I have used the bread machine 6 times. I keep adjusting the recipe, but so far my sourdough bread is quite dense and heavy. I am not ready to give up yet. I bought the machine to replace having to kneed and roll out the bread. I am sure it would make the white bead recipe very well. The machine has quite a few menu choices. I have tried the ones that allow for extra rising time. Once I get it to make my sourdough bread well, I will give it a higher rating."
1,Bad purchase,"This was the only bread machine I found available locally so I purchased it. It made so much noise while it was kneeding that it would wake the dead. I tried adding more water but it still clunked and then the bread top fell and the bread was dense and crusty. On the third load, the LED stuck in the ""jam"" position. I returned it to the store for a refund."
3,Some more relevant details up front would help.,"PalmOne m500 HandheldThe unit was brand new with all accessories included. What the posting did not mention however, was that the ""native"" language of the unit was Japanese. Starting from scratch, it was not difficult to convert almost all language into English. Unfortunately, the resident software, which cannot be erased, still had two apps in Japanese. If you activate either, the language of the entire PDA becomes Japanese. Unless you know Japanese or have a friend who does, and you can get back to English, you're S.O.L. Add one and a half stars if someone you know has a fix.DNA"
1,Rip off,"This product doesn't work properly. And if you find one that does work, keep in mind that Palm no longer supports this model."
5,Palm,I bought this as a spare but never used it as it is still in the box. I'm still usimg my original.
5,get this recording now,"This is a fantastic release. I highly recommend this recording, excellent work. My only complaint is that this is a single CD not a double, and well worth twice the price. Please may we have another?"
1,Bad DVD Player- poor customer service,"I bought the Philips Pet 805 for my mom for her birthday (she often takes my daughter on trips and I thought it would help in the car) . It got some use but nothing too heavy. About 3 months after I bought it it started acting funny, soon it no longer played any DVDs. When I contacted Philips I got the usual phone runaround, the warranty is expired, I'm sorry sir etc. I have now written a letter to Philips hoping for some help with my $200 piece of junk. Buyer beware!"
5,Great Portable,"This is a great buy. It isn't costly, and you get everything you would want from a portable dvd player. In addition to great picture, you get a powerful sound out of tiny speakers. I know a lot of dvd players have the problem of the sound being too low, or hear constant weird noises coming from the speakers, but it isn't the case here. The quality on the picture is amazing. The screen is bigger than the standard 7 inch size (it is 8 inches diagonally) and you don't have to constantly recharge it in order for it to work. I would say it works a lot longer than the predicted 2 1/2 hours and almost doesn't uncharge at all when not used. Those of you to whom look is important as well would be satisfied with it's really nice metallic look. The only drawback with this player is that it is a little heavy for a small portable. I would say it is safe to proceed to check out with this item."
5,Grandchild are enjoying...,"Bought this for grandkids for a long vacation trip in the car, they tried it out before the trip and everything was good. 14 hour car trip and they watched movies all the way and every night for a week before bed and back home in car again. Picture is great and they were happy with sound without ear plugs. No problems so far. I like the looks of case and it is well built. They bought a case to hang it over the back seat in the car. Picture looks better from several feet away. Recommend it."
2,"Unsophisticated, Disappointing and Boring","My son is 3 1/2 and loves Bob and playing on the computer. This CD was a huge disappointment. It does not meet the standards of most quality Windows 95/98 CDs for this age group. Most of the movement through the games is done with the arrows on the keyboard rather than the mouse - primitive at best. My son likes to see the characters that he knows and loves but is bored with the program after about five minutes. Graphics, music, voice assistance are all out of date. Too bad. We bought this program in the U.K. Was hoping that the U.S. version would be something different but from the picture of the cover that Amazon is showing it appears to be the same CD ROM that I have. Too bad."
1,Dissapointed,"I actually WAITED for this to come out...my son wanted it so much...now that it is here i can't say how terribly dissapointing it is...the games are tedious and uneducational and even worse, boring for my 4 year old....i own MANY (ok, WAY too many) cd's - this is one of the worst"
2,They couldn't fix it,"This is the most boring program my son has - for me anyway. He likes parts of it but gets tired of it quickly. It's also very hard to navigate with the mouse. He's just over two now and he LOVES Bob but he hardly ever picks this game to play. There are more fun things on the Bob the Builder website. I would not recommend this game, even for Bob fans."
1,Does not work on anything newer than Win98,"This program does not run at all on Windows XP.The canned response from THQ ""support"":""THQ does not offer support for any of our products running on Windows XP, 2000 or NT, unless otherwise stated on the packaging. Many of our products that were designed for Windows 95/98 will not detect other operating system, as an optimized operating system, and therefore may not properly install or run.""Why are they still selling games that will only run on Windows 98? That OS is over 5 years old! How can THQ justify selling software that will not work on a current OS? (Windows XP has been out for nearly two years.) Worse yet, how can they justify taking our money for it just to dissapoint our children when it won't run. If they insist on selling this outdated junk, they should put a warning sticker on it and make the limitations prominent on the packaging. Shame on you THQ."
2,Disappointing,"Hard to believe THQ thought this one was ready to ship. A pretty scanty product-- there aren't many games on the disk, and the one that are are short and not much fun to play. My 2 1/2 year old loves both Bob and kids' computer games, but lost interest in this one right off. One gets the feeling the publisher had a deadline to meet, and no time to take a look at the finished product and give it a good clean-up. Even more disjointed and less fun than the same publisher's ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" game."
2,"Only game, nothing educational","I bought my 3 y/o son this. I was hoping for educational value. He for fun. Most of the modules ened up being games, racing, building bridges, etc... without teaching anything more than how to manipulate a mouse. But even they are not so exciting. My son, who was so thrilled to get it, was bored in a day. The Blue Clue and Reader Rabbit software products are far better. It's a shame that the BBC let their name be attached to this disappointing product."
1,another DUD for childrens software,"There seems to be a great lack of quality in childrens software and this is a shining example. Children look forward to using a new title and it is heartbreaking to have them disappointed. The game is very difficult to load and seems to have endless video problems. Customer support is pretty much nil, web sites that the game refers you to have no on-line support for the game. I would definetly pass and buy something from Reader Rabbit. (this game ended up in garbage)"
1,Can THEY fix it?,"I'm not sure that I am more disappointed with the product or the sales method. I ordered and received the software only to find that it was advertised to work in Windows ME but it only rated for 95 or 98. Of course, if I try it, I will not be able to return the opened software. It was very difficult to reach customer support with the manufacturer and two people called several times and e-mailed them until we finally spoke to someone who said it wasn't rated for ME or 2000 but they couldn't tell us anything since it was written in Germany."
3,3 stars: Mediocre,"Excellent for those young 2-4 year olds. Simple, easy to follow games and instructions that require little mouse knowledge and very little parent assistance. Above 5 year old: slim picking and alittle dull. ... My 4 year old had fun with it and hopefully will play it again. I must say he did plow through the games. There's easy, medium and challenging on all the games. The challenging is a bit too challenging where the likely hood of winning is slimmer and can cause frustration. The easy & medium is good for the under 5 year olds. It's fun, especially for those Bob & wendy fans out there.I can't honestly say that this game is worth anymore than $10. It's cute, but not more than $10 cute. So, buy it, but buy it on sale"
4,Our 5 and 8 year-olds love this game.,"We bought this game for our 5 year-old son. It took a few minutes for him to get the hang of it, but now he loves it. At first, he was a bit flustrated because there are some many options that he felt overwealmed. After one day of play, he loved it. He play's it often and we have even caught our ""very cool"" 8 year-old daughter joining in. This is every bit as cute as the show and there are so many games that your little one will not get bored. Also, set up is easy and it runs great on our new computer and the latest windows version."
3,Bob the Builder,Some hand eye coordination too difficult for the younger set. slow response to changes.
5,kids loved it,"I got this for my 5 year old for Christmas because he loves watching the Bob show on Nickolodeon. He loves playing it as does my eight year old daughter, go figure!"
4,Very tough cables good for making lengthy connections,"I am using 3 sets of these to connect my DVD player to 5.1 speakers. Working very well. The connectors' gold plating did come off after a few months, hence 1 star less. However, I couldn't make out any difference in the audio quality. May be the setup I have opted for making such connections will not appeal to audio purists, but this solved my purpose. Also, these cables are very very tough, really good for lengthy connections through walls and across room. I have used similar cables to make component as well as composite video connections and I am liking it very much!!"
1,Pure Junk,"This is about the most vague and weak plan that could have been put together. The general theme that stands out, seems to indicate that the US should no longer be a soverign nation. Apparently, the John and John show want to let the UN decide what the US foreign policy should be. This is a real insult to all of the veterans that have fought to keep this country strong and free.""Specifics"" in the economic area include the action verbs of influencing, encouraging, supporting and increasing pressure. These are not specific in the ""how"" department.Other areas seem very general and most seem sugar coated enough to appeal to everyone. The hazard of this approach is that you have no idea what the real application is of this general idea..."
5,For Insight Into John Kerry Look Here,"Anyone who's serious about America's future should read this book. Maybe, if we're wise enough to elect John Kerry, he can rescue us before it's too late."
2,Not much here,"I got this with the Complete Idiot's Guide to Running a B & B on the comments of others. I wouldn't waste your time on this book but the Idiot's guide is of value. This book has all kinds of stories that really don't help when deciding if a B & B is something I want to do. I haven't read the entire book because it just doesn't provide useful information to me, but read half with the hope of finding some gem of knowledge. There has to be a better second book out there than this."
5,"A Fast, Fun Read. Worth Your Time","I'd like to start out by indicating, I have absolutely NO desire to become an innkeeper and I have never been to the Northwoods of Wisconsin. But it was a fun little trip to what the author paints as a beautiful part of the country and I can see how she and her husband fell in love with the area the first time they saw it.As for the business, I don't think this book is meant to give advice necessarily, although she certainly does. I think it is simply a memoir and she tells her story in a funny, readable way.This is the second book I have read by Michele Cozzens. I enjoyed the first one I read so much, I decided to give this a look, too. I wasn't disappointed. Contrary to what a reviewer wrote here that she is ""grumpy"" and hates people, I found the opposite to be true. She is clearly very intelligent and very funny. Sometimes people find this threatening. Don't make that mistake. She's a teriffic writer."
5,MUSIC THAT'S OVER THE TOP,"ONE OF COZY'S BEST ALBUMS, EVERY TRACK IS GREAT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE AWESOME SHM AUDIO FORMAT. MUST HAVE FOR ANY CD COLLECTION, BUT DON'T PAY THESE RIDICULOUS OVER-INFLATED RIP OFF PRICES, I BOUGHT MINE FROM THE MUSIC SPECIALIST ON E BAY, SAVE YOURSELF A TON OF CASH.CHEERS!"
2,Did not like it,"I love Colosseum II, 70s Jeff Beck and Jack Bruce and was hoping to find some of that progressive creativity in this cd (after all, musicians from these mentioned groups are involved). But everything here is REALLY lame and in my opinion of real bad taste. Just listen to those so-called 'compositions'... and the sounds picked! talk about dated!"
5,Great,"came so quickly! and I love this book! ordered this one as a gift, will definitely order another for myself, and probably more as gifts."
5,"excellent overview of Asian poetry, and thought","I found about the series written by Mr Blyth from a suggested reading list drawn up by Allen Ginsberg. Just a great, clearheaded, review of all things poetical. Not just Haiku. For anyone interested in loving the life you live."
4,some good songs,"I did not buy this cd, but checked it out from my library. There are several really good songs that are appropriate for preludes, and then the other standards are good as well. I plan on using about five songs from this cd at my wedding. The songs are mostly instrumental but one version of ""The Rose"" is a vocal version. The same holds true for some of the marches, which are done in both instrumental and organ arrangements. All in all it is a very good cd both for it's selection and the sound of the songs."
3,Controls,"I love adventure games and when I saw this game I had to have it!! There are few adventure games out there and you look forward to any new releases,but this game disappointed me. The overall game play was fine but the keyboard controls ruined this game for me. I have been unable to finish it because of this reason. I have spent more time trying to move my character around then actual game play. You try so hard to maneuver correctly that you lose out on the joy of playing! The set up for the key control does not even make sense. The camera angles that are used do not help either. Why they chose keyboard controls I will never know. If they could fix that the game would be great. So if you are use to a mouse this game is not for you."
1,Technically flawed,"Do yourself a favor and skip this game. I installed it on three different recent PC's and could never get it to play correctly, even after downloading and configuring a suite of codecs. If you press the spacebar multiple times on the introductory blank screen, you eventually get to the game. The keyboard controls are crude and will rapidly try your patience; the mouse is not supported!!! There are too many great adventure games on the market for you to waste your time and money on this one."
1,Technical difficulties insurmountable,"To date I have been unable to play this game with XP or Vista. Though my systems meet the requirements, I have had major issues with the graphics that make the game unplayable. Certain layers of the graphics white out so that I cannot ever see the full scene for more than a few seconds. I searched for a patch to correct this but have found none. Otherwise, I think I would have really enjoyed this game once I got used to the navigation. Seems like it would be great if only I could see it."
2,Could not play this game,"I liked this game,what little of it I could play. I did not have any trouble installing it on Windows XP. When I started to play the game at the beginning the graphics were so messed up that all I got was flickers of a white screen. I countinued to try to play and finally got my character to the mansion where the graphics was good the whole time until the scene switched to the cliffs then the graphics were so bad I could not even see the character to move him where he was supposed to go. I tried installing on Windows Vista. It installed find but could not play after install. I would still like to finish this game but I just gave up on it. I thought I had a defective CD until I read some of the other reviews. I think the company should do something about this game which I have e-mailed them three times and no answer as of yet."
2,AWSD control,"I hardly started this game when I quit. This is a 2007 game that still uses the old DOS ( mouseless ) method of navigating the entire thing. In the old days when there was no mouse to operate with, this keyboard operation of a game was necessary. Meese have been around for a long time now and it certainly is nice to use a mouse to navigate a game. I don't even know what the story is about or how tricky the puzzles are or anything else about this game. Keyboard only is all I know. Nope, not for me."
1,"Too painful to play, Big disappointment.","The programming on this game is SO bad that I couldn't even continue playing it. As others have said, the navigation was terrible. I also don't like being killed and having to start all over again. The music was very oddly placed and annoying. The graphics were pretty basic and the characters say the same lines over and over. Too many problems. I can't believe The Adventure Company bought this one. The authors must have used some canned game engine and it shows. They should try to fix it, and then re-release it. Too bad, I was waiting for this with great anticipation."
2,Dead Reefs,"Although it appeared to be rather frightening, it really isn't. The characters are very stilted and it's slow moving."
3,Better than nothing but not great,"With 2 graduate degrees from PSU, I applauded the idea of this book. So far as I know, there has never been a history of Penn State Women. However, the actual product was a disappointment. With as many errors in section on 1960-mid 1970s as I saw,I can only question the scholarship related to the earlier history and the biases about the recent history.Hopefully, this will be an impetus for other scholars to undertake real research, extensive interviews-not just those who volunteer or are part of the sponsoring body, and careful analysis and reporting of how things were for Penn State Women over the ages."
2,Background Music,"Although there are a couple of songs I like on this CD, mostly I was disappointed. Most of the songs are insipid and uninspired. It would make a nice inoffensive ""soft jazz"" CD to play softly in a restaurant while people are dining, but not something I want to sit and listen to or even play at a party."
2,Bended,"The product was received on time but bended, not good enough for having the car baked in a good way."
5,excellent,I used this cake pan to make a Wiggles cake for my 3 year old son. It worked perfectly! I would only caution people who use this cake pan to follow the directions enclosed and stabilize it in your oven. It tipped over on me and I had a huge mess the first time I tried it.
3,ok,I would have liked a little bigger of a cake in general. But it is an easy one to decorate and personalize. Cute and usefull to. I can see doing quite a few of these for different people in the years to come.
4,Cute pan!,Purchased this for my son's First Birthday cake and made a little red punchbug cake for him. It was so cute and matched his invitations perfectly!
2,Not for the novice,"The cake stuck to the inside of this pan. I'm also not what you would call a fantastic baker, but nevertheless it turned out to be wasted money on my part.If you think your baker enough for it use lots and lots of non-stick coating! The seller was excellent though. The product was shipped to me quickly and in the great condition it was promised to be in."
1,Not Good,I would welcome the opportunity to return this item immediately if not sooner! Im forced to give 1 star. I would really give none.
3,Stick with Ultra 3d Thrillride for the gameboy,"I am a pinball aficinado, and so I was disappointed when I played this game for the first time, considering I had waited through 6 months of release date delays. Although players can switch between tables featuring gonzo, miss piggy, and kermit, I have not found this game to be nearly as exciting as the ultra 3d thrillride. Game play is a lot shorter here as balls are lost quickly."
4,Excellent LeCreuset as usual.,Great Le Creuset product. Can go from stovetop to oven. Only drawback is that it is so heavy.
5,love it,"I own several peices of cast iron, and this is my newest one, takes the place of a fry/wok pan. I made chicken pot pie my first night, and stir fry the next, I can get the veggies, meat and noodles in at the last minute.this size is good for three women with moderate appetties, maybe one left over portion.Plan on having this pan for the rest of my life, so easy to clean! just soak for a few minutes.I burned my pan! agghhhh! put it back on the burner full of water and baking soda, simmered it ,scraped with a platic spatual and it came clean!"
1,Terrible Album,"This is just one of the most horrible albums I have ever heard. The songs are very repetative, and the vocalist sucks. Do not buy this record!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I will never buy from this seller again, they sent me the wrong order and would not take a return or refund. When I called the number, the place didn't exist. Amazon should consider not even doing business with the company."
5,I love these,I peel off the tape and leave them in the wrapper when I refill my tub. They stay more moist and feed better that way. The diapers are great too.
2,Poor product discription- look at photo,This not the product I ordered. The product shipped has a hard plastic resealable lid. Seventh Generation refills do not have the resealable lid...resealable lids are not refill packets.
5,"Seventh Generation Unscented Baby Wipes with Aloe Vera & Vitamin E, Refill - 80 ea",See previous review.
2,Could do without them,"They were a little hard to install, but once they were on they looked good. However, they are quick to come loose after crashes and easily to loose. I got a rolling cage instead so I wont have to mess with the body and the pins all the time."
3,It makes me want to know what he's not saying,"Mostly about the making of the film, The Cider House Rules, but written before the film's marketting or theatrical release--actually, before the film's final cut--it did make me want to re-watch the movie and re-read not only the novel but other novels of his as well, particularly A Widow For One Year and A Son of the Circus (which has always been my favourite).As with all Irving memoirs, it makes me want to know what he's not saying, what he's hiding...but readable, nonetheless.For more, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal!"
1,Slim in content as well as size...,"There are reasons I should have liked this book: 1) I'm a huge John Irving fan; 2) I'm in show business and have always enjoyed books that deconstruct the creative process; 3) I'm a writer, and am interested in how other writers write. That said, I was sorely disappointed in this insignificant volume. From beginning to end it reads like nothing more than Irving's rushed effort to fulfill an obligation to his publishers. The diatribes about abortion are jarring and the insights into Irving's process not all that insightful. Curiously, the final screenplay is quite marvelous, as a visit to the film will prove. Go see it, or read the original book, which is a gem."
1,Narcissistic and pointless,"A vanity publication and nothing more. So puzzlingly and tendentiously self-directed, so lacking a larger, more instructive context, My Movie Business reads like a dull diary kept by your most selfish friend."
4,A postcard. . .,"John Irving's newest book, is a 'postcard' from the great novelist to his fans. Definitely not heavy reading, but enjoyable reading. Especially for those who love The Cider House Rules, the details he gives on how he came to write the book and the screenplay are great. Sweet and short!"
3,A great under-rated book about the Secret Service.,"Too bad this book is horribly unknown, it was very interetsting, especially about the Kennedy Assassination. R7 RULES!"
3,Not ideal for traveling,"We use one of these bags at home, but beware they are not totally waterproof. When wet cloth diapers are stored in these, they will leak through the woven fabric. I have to keep mine stored on top of the washing machine until I do laundry so the floor under the bag does not get wet. I would not recommend traveling with this bag unless you have a way to keep everything else around it dry. I do like that this bag can be thrown in the wash with the dirty diapers though."
3,Water resistant but NOT waterPROOF,"I use these as a liner for a hamper of used cloth diapers. They're good enough for that purpose, but when I use the bags outside of a metal hamper (at a second home where the bag sits on the floor) there has been some seepage, so I've learned to put them inside a plastic trash bag. They're probably adequate for containing things that are damp but not soaked for shorter periods, but if you need a bag for something very wet or to hold damp fabric for more than a couple hours, be aware these might not cut it.They are very durable and have come through multiple laundry loads (machine wash, hang dry) as good as new."
5,Wonderful,A wonderful collection of an accomplished poet's best poems. What more is there to say? Buy this!
2,translation,"I am very disappointed in the translation of these poems. So much of the poetic nature is lost by the overly-practical interpretations here. There is a much better version of many in Sounds, Thoughts, and Feelings."
3,talented poet,"Szymborska is a talented poet. She conveys a dark view of humanity through her poetry. In her poem ""Hatred"" Szymborska explores the human emotion of hate. She describes it as efficient; in no way blind or patient. Humanity's hate is immortal and ""unflinching."" Another example of Szymborska's dark view of humanity is expressed in ""Advertisement."" Advertisements are manmade; they take over people and make them promises. She goes as far as to calling them the devil asking for your soul.Szymborka's poems are written in simple language so anyone can understand them. She does not make them unduly complex. Her writing makes one think and does not take life lightly."
4,Amazing Poet,"Szymborska's book, ""Poems New and Collected"" rattles the mind's realm of reality, spirituality, and unknown humanity. A predominate pattern of poisioning passages of darkness lead to peepholes to positive. She delivers a inspiringly intelligent, thought inciting pile of poems. She displays a great genius with the poem, ""Four A.M."" as it generates ideas on aspects glomming in the back of all creatures nonexistent or existing minds. She touches audiences with poems like ""Parable"" which toss out open ended questions about our own lives. Szymborska almost sees humans with an open hand hovering over the world's weather of events brought on by unnamed named fates. Szymborska's book is a sail set adventure on the ying and yang yacht of pondering poetry."
4,Murder in the Cathedral,"The Madonna Murders is a classically good mystery. It starts with characters you care about -- Andrea West is a literary daughter of both Amanda Cross's academic world and Elizabeth Peters' adventurous women, Keith, the love interest is really loveable, and the villains and Russian holy men are fantastic -- then it adds some really weird and exciting events beginning with murder in the Cathedral, an immersion into the spiritual culture of Russian America and a tense and exciting conclusion. Cranston has done her homework. You can enter her world with confidence. From beginning to hair-raising end, you won't be able to put this one down."
4,A review of The Madonna Murders,"I read the book in two sittings. It was an easy read, perfect for traveling. I was quickly engaged by the story. The book was entertaining throughout and educational at the same time. I knew little of religious iconography in general and the history of the Russian community in the San Francisco Bay area in particular. I learned a little about both.The book was particularly timely for me, as I was going out to visit the Bay area for the first time in many years. I live on the east coast. I also learned about the Crystal Skull, another icon featured in the book as well as the latest Indiana Jones movie. Again, the book was particularly timely for me, as I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull right after my reading of the book. It certainly made my viewing of the movie more enjoyable.I recommend it for someone looking for an entertaining story as well as a little education."
1,Where is the potency shown?,Amazon should require that the potency be included in a standard format for all such items.
3,uhmm......brief description.,"Mela's this work is the first geographical description in Latin. as a beginner for historical geography, i expected more than real, cuz i have seen many quotations about this book from many other books. it is very cleared, but simple descriptions. If you want to know more about the ancient geography, i recommend other works such as Strabo, Pausanias (you can find these from Loeb Classical Libraries), et. al. But if you need to study it as a expert, you can choose this."
3,Good for teachers familiar with constructivist technique,"This is a good but way too short book about constructivist teaching in the science classroom. For teachers who are not familair with constructivist teaching methods, or don't really understand them, I recommend you read some of the literature or take a course on it first. There is not enough information in this book, I think, for the newbie to constructivist teaching. I would like to see more detail about how the instructors got from September to May, and more detail on how they scheduled time, especially journal time.There are some great tips in here if you do know some things about constructivist teaching. The whole concept of teaching science and inquiry is well explained, and I will gratefully use many of their ideas. The book does a good job of helping teachers link chemistry with everyday life, and takes some of the ""academic only"" focus away from the laboratory."
4,Indian Peaks Wilderness Backpacking Guide,Extensive backpacking & trail guide from the mid 80's. Good trail descriptions with photos leading throughout this beautiful wilderness area. All high passes are also described in detail. This is NOT a climbing guide of the beautiful mountains in this area.
4,Makes a difference in the coat,"I've been using this product for about 3 months now. We have an 11 month old Boxer with some skin problems so I wanted to add a supplement to her diet to help with that. After using it for about a month, her coat was noticeably shinier, even the vet commented that her colors seemed more vibrant. He also commented that fish oil is a natural anti-inflammatory, which is why I'm also giving it to our 9 year old Boxer. Can't quantify any improvements with her, but hoping that it keeps her joints a little healthier as she ages. If you're using it strictly for coat/skin, you'll notice a difference in about a month."
2,Smells ok but doesn't help,"I ordered this as a remedy for my Cocker Spaniel's ear yeast issue. Came with a disclaimer attached to the product warning about using it in the ears, even though thats what it's advertised for. Included a number to call for support, but the number was blocked. Mildly deoderant, but useless if you can't put it in the dog's ear where the yeast forms. I wouldn't buy from this company again."
3,Messermeister Pro Touch 4 inch Cookie spatual,It is larger than I anticipated. Size description needs to be improved.I was a bit disappointed in the product.
4,"Mad Mike, one of military histories greats","The story of Brigadier Calvert's life is one sprinkled with tragedy. He was truly one the the great special operations soldiers in history. So much could have been learned from him that wasn't.Unlike so many British Commanders, he lead his men from the front. He picked up the name ""Mad Mike"", when he intentionally took another British Commander, who was getting his men killed, out to a point zeroed in by Japanese Machine Gunners. This was a man who was willing to get killed to save his men. He did this in full view of his men who fully expected him to die.The book about him, could have been written better. It didn't quite do him the justice that it could have. I hope that the British government will vindicate and apologize to him. God bless you General, you are truly an exceptional human being."
2,Mike Calvert,"Rooney's book is a good chronicle of Mike Calvert's life. Although well researched, it is not a biography in my opinion. The book tells us just about nothing of Calvert's man within. Contrast this with the wealth of detail concerning the life of a fighter from the previous generation, Siegfried Sassoon. I rather fancy these two may have something in common. I am left without any information concerning Mike Calvert's attitude to sex, love, and other values. We are told precious little about Mike's friends. Rooney does not adequately explain just why did Calvert antagonise so many other senior officers. I am prepared to accept Rooney's view that the indecency charges concerning Mike and German youths were unfairly and relentlessly pursued. What puzzles me is why? People like myself who have ambivalent feelings concerning their sexuality would have benefited from a biography rather than a chronicle."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Steve Brickman has even more problems, as he is again out in the world,and Cadillac and Clearwater, two important Mutes, have been takencaptive.He must go all Shogun, and attempt to rescue them from the Japanesesociety that they have been taken too. Japan has reverted to theirxenophobic medieval ways, so it will be terribly difficult."
4,ow,First they absolutely work. Follow the instructions which come in about 27 languages for your convenience.I did experience some tooth sensitivity during the whitening but I've always had sensitive teeth. I use sensodyne toothpaste just because of that. Not sure if everyone will have the same sensitivity as I. They absolutely work though. I have the whitest chompers ever.
2,Did nothing,This product did not do what it was advertised to do.My teeth are stained and there was no difference in their appearance after the 2 hour use of this product.
4,pretty good,"easy to use, but it did make the inside of my upper lip sore, didn't whiten as much as i hoped for."
4,Works for me!,"After feeling ""so-so"" about Crest White Strips for years, I am a recent Rembrandt convert. The Rembrandt trays are much easier to use than strips, and they seem to whiten more completely around the tooth than the strips do. I agree with those who complained of tingling and burning along the gum line after one or two sessions, but I found that stopping and taking a break for a few days worked fine for me. Who says you have to use the whole box in 2 hours? Do whatever makes you comfortable. I've bought and used two kits in the past month, and my teeth look great. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is thinking of trying it."
2,Good but be careful,I bought this item because it was on sale for under 8 dollars. Then i read the reviews so i decided not to use all 4 treatments at once and im glad i didnt. It does burn your gums and makes your teeth sensitve as well. I decided not to use the other 2 treatments due to my gums being painful. I would say it did make my teeth a little whiter but its not worth the pain. I would not buy this again and would not recommend to anyone
1,"Sat on shelf too long, and product image misleading",Title says it all. Final results were too insignificant to be worth it. took a chance and felt my money was wasted.
2,Did Not Work,Normally I dont review items but this did not work as advertised. While whitening everything looked good but after the two hours I rinsed with water and no change.
1,Get a Dentist to Do Your Teeth Instead,"I purchased this product with high hopes, but, unfortunately was disappointed. My teeth haven't changed much unless they're seen under white, studio lights and not the traditional domestic, home lighting (which has a yellow tint). I think my teeth, a lot like countless of other people, have the Most Stubborn of stains teeth could ever have so it'd be suggested that people like me have a Dentist (D.D.S) do it professionally with the proper equipment.This product didn't work for me. If it did, the improvement was so trivial, it's not even noticeable. I won't buy this product again. Spent over $18.00 on it, but, oh well... you get what you pay for, right?"
1,Painful for days after,"I used the 2 hour whitening process in the evening about 2 hours before bed. I only noticed very mild irritation with the final application. However, the next morning I had blisters along the top and bottom of my gums and severe tooth pain like a toothache in several teeth. I am now two days post using and still having pain in my teeth. The blisters are starting to heal but are still pretty painful. My teeth are whiter, I'll give it that, but not worth the pain. Since I had no pain while using the product I didn't even consider discontinuing it, unfortunately the painful results were delayed. On the bright side my teeth are whiter and I think I lost a couple of pounds from not being able to eat for two days because of the blisters and tooth pain. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,4 days (and counting) of severe pain,"Used this product on Friday. It is now Tuesday and I still have swollen gums, open sores, and severe pain. I did not overfill the trays or use it longer than the directions indicated. I did everything exactly as directed. By the fourth application, I noticed that my teeth were hurting. The box said this was normal and would go away after a couple hours. So I finished the kit.Big mistake.The next morning, I woke up in huge pain. My gums were very red and swollen (mostly the lower gums). Soon after, I developed open sores. Now, my tonsils are very swollen and I can barely swallow. I haven't been able to eat much in the past 4 days. I am completely miserable.I contacted Rembrandt and they might give me my money back. Oh, and my teeth aren't even any whiter. Don't bother with this product."
4,EFFECTIVE BUT.......,"We've used Rembrandt products for several years now, and have always been pleased. We're also pleased with the results of this whitening process.However, we have found the trays not very uncomfortable and that they have a tendency to slip around a bit. For those who don't wish to spend the night with trays in your mouths this is may be the answer - if you can find the two hours!"
4,Works well for superficial stains,"I got turned onto this product from their new commercial because it said it would penetrate even deep stains.One of my teeth has some internal staining so I thought I'd give this a shot to try and even out that tooth's color more. Don't get me wrong this whitening kit works great for the money on superficial stains (like most people have) and all the rest of my teeth are now a gleaming paper white! But that one tooth is only a couple shades whiter, even after doing an hours worth of solely whitening that tooth.Advice for when using:They tell you to use one ampule of gel per tray, but this is waaaay too much and so causes pain on your gums and wasted whitening gel. After doing that once, I used 1/2 ampule per tray which is the perfect amount and gets you twice the amount of whitening time!I'm going to save the trays and use a cheaper whitening gel I have to maintain my now pearly whites. :)"
3,"Painful, but it works.","The process was very painful for me. Burning open sores is the easiest way to put it. And i'm pretty sure that these sores were not there prior to using this product. However, pain went away after about an hour or two. Definitely happy with the results however. This product would get 5 stars if I wasn't in such agonizing pain for 2 hours."
1,Don't even waste your money,This sucks! I wish I could return my money back. The toothpaste works great but not this. I did what the direction told me to and it didnt do a thing!
3,Hmm..,I used this product once it gave me okay results but I've seen better with my crest white strips but maybe that's just a preference thing.
4,Used These Many Times,"I have used these 2-Hour Whitening kits from Rembrandt since they came out. This is the first one I have used in about two years and it seems like the formula has changed.If you have sensitive teeth or gums, don't use this product. I got through the first hour of the process without any issues, but I could feel my gums tingling. From previous experience I decided to wait a few days for the final hour.Overall it definitely made my teeth a few shades whiter. I would buy again."
2,not impressed,"I have to say the price was right, but the results are lacking. I can see NO difference in my tooth color. I also can say I experienced NO pain or discomfort. The taste was tolerable and minimal. You are only supposed to use enough to cover your teeth, if you can really taste the gel you are using too much. My gums can be sensitive, but were not bothered at all by this product, which is good....if my gums hurt and my teeth were the same color I would be upset, but really I wasted time and money, nothing else."
3,Product is ok,Product is ok. I barely noticed a change. I wasnt expecting my teeth to be super white but I thought it would have worked a little better than it did.
2,not worth the money,"It maybe only takes 2 hours but after 1/2 way through the second 20 min treatment I was asking myself ""what the heck was I thinking"". I couldn't really get the trays to fit well and stay in my mouth, very slimy, just awful. Not worth the money. There has got to be a better way to do this."
1,not impressive,"I am quitting smoking, so I thought whitening my teeth would help me to stop. Forming the trays to my teeth was easy, so I was optimistic. I filled the trays with the bleaching gel, popped them in my mouth and set the timer. Within five minutes I could feel it burning my gums but I hung on. Ten minutes, still burning. I made it to twenty minutes, removed the trays and looked. My teeth didn't look different, but my gums in several places where it burned the most were bleached white! I rinsed my mouth with water but they stayed white. I was more careful putting the gel only on my teeth for the second round, but only made it 12 minutes before the burning was too much to handle. I brushed my teeth and gums immediately but they stayed ghostly white for two days, a little creepy since I am a culinary instructor and talk for a living. I see very little difference in the color of my teeth, so the pain isn't worth it."
1,read the reviews and tried it anyway,"definitely not worth the time. you spend most of the 2 hours trying not to drool all over yourself, and then you don't even get noticeable results. i just finished the process, and it didn't hurt - but I don't see any results. the good thing is you can send in to get a full refund - which I will be doing first thing 2mrrw. I rec. the Target white strips that do the job in 1 week - clear results, super cheap!"
3,oops,"lol. Just have a Rembrandt 5 second fail. In order to mold trays I ran plain water through my Keurig (says to use water the temperature of coffee..) Dropped the trays in and walked to the couch to mold them. Well in the 5 seconds from the couch to the living room (probably 3.5 seconds), the trays had melted into balls. Now I am stuch with ten little tubes of tis stuf but my kids have two new superballs to play with. Watch the trays!"
1,Remembrant white wasn't that good.,"When i tried this, it didn't get my teeth as white as they lead me to believe. The taste made me gag. It was horrible and the mouth trays didn't really work on keeping the gel on my teeth. My teeth have white spots that are still visible. Even after i brushed my teeth."
2,DO NOT PURCHASE,"Although I am satisfied with the brightening of my teeth, my lower gums still have severe tenderness and soreness a full three days after the treatment. I was only able to get through three of the four sessions becuse of the tenderness on my gums. I have used other whitening systems in the past without any issues, so I was suprised at my experience.I will not use the rest of this product or purchase it again in the future because of the way my teeth and gums have reacted. I advise trying another whitening product."
4,Worked for me,"I used this kit last night and I found the process fairly straightforward. I hesitated on using this particular kit because of all the negative reviews but I think it depends on how much care you put into making sure the trays fit snugly so the gel doesn't burn the gums. I had to re-dip my trays in the warm water about three times to get them to fit just right. Then, I cut off the extra plastic just above where my teeth met my gums. I also only used one ampule for each application (both trays) so I have four left over that I plan on using in the future. As for the results, I do think that my teeth whitened a couple shades. I was definitely hoping for a really bright bright white, but from previous kit experiences, I know it's not that easy. Today, my teeth do feel a bit sensitive but I think that's expected. I say the Rembrandt 2-Hour Whitening Kit is worth a try if you're willing to be patient and careful with the application."
5,Very good,"This is a very good whitening method to keep your teeth white after they begin to yellow. I did mine professionally but could not afford going back for more treatments after a couple of years, so I bought this because I had tried Rempbrant toothpaste and mouthwash (they are the BEST combination) and I could not do the strips because they always managed to fall off and I never saw any good results. With this, you will see results but you have to follow the directions carefully because even though it doesn't feel like your teeth are getting any sensitivity; it CAN if you don't follow directions, believe me; I know. But, I love it. You get what you pay for with this product."
2,It was okay,Didn't work as well as I thought. My teeth were only 12 shade lighter as opposed to what Rembrandt promised. Well...you get what you pay for.
3,"It does whiten, it just doesn't last.","I followed the directions on this item to a t. It did in fact whiten, though it was a little challenging to do so, and did definitely cause some tooth discomfort. That would have been worth it to me, had the results been longer lived. However, given that I think my teeth were sort of, back to normal if you will, within days, I wouldn't recommend this product, unless perhaps you just want a few shades whiter for pictures or an event and need to do it fast/aren't concerned with longevity of the whiteness."
2,Didn't see much of a difference,"I use Remembrandt toothpaste and I really like it, so I decided to try out the whitening kit, especially because it's much cheaper online than in the stores. Even though I put the mold into near-boiling water, it still didn't mold well to my teeth, so I had to constantly use my mouth to hold against my teeth. After the entire thing was over, I didn't notice much difference. I think that this would be more helpful if I had coffee or tea stains that I needed to whiten. Instead, I think I have teeth that are more naturally dark that won't improve with the whitening kit.I bought two, though, so I'm going to try the second one out by putting it into hot water for longer and trying to change where I squeeze the whitening gel - I put it in the mold last time, but I don't think it actually reached the top of the front of my teeth. We'll see how that goes."
1,not impressed,"I am 21, not a coffee drinker, smoker or pop drinker. So needless to say my teeth aren't stained yellow or that yellow to begin with. The gel stung my gums after the 2nd of 4 rounds of whitening. After all 4 trays were done I honestly didn't see a difference and my gums still hurt the day after. I wouldn't recommend this unless your teeth are super yellow then it might do you some good. But don't expect a beautiful white smile like the commercials."
4,Works Well Enough,"This whitened my teeth a couple of levels. Not as white as I hoped, but a definite improvement. First dose got on my gums and made them sore. Next I just used a q-tip and Vaseline to smear on my gums at the tooth line (careful not to cover my teeth). This protected my gums from being exposed to the peroxide bleach... and no more pain. I will order a few kits to have on hand and use them every couple of months. Good value."
2,It wasnt for me...,"My teeth did become slightly whiter. I was happy with that. However, it became very painful with each additional 20 min. My gums were stinging the whole time and were turning white. I have tried crest white strips before and they seem to whiten better and they are not painful at all."
3,worked for a while,"I have used many whiteners before and tried this one because of the short-term commitment. I tried the 2-hour method and noticed whiter teeth. I was quite pleased. They weren't extremely white, but very noticeable (my Mom noticed a couple of days later that my teeth looked whiter) My gums were sore at the end, and was sweating out the last application. (Try hard not to get it on your gums, but the pain goes away a half-hour after removal). Too bad that after a few short weeks you'd never know I whitened them. I tried the second application but forgot to put the narrow cap on the application tube and only got 2 sets of trays worth (instead of 4), and they don't look any whiter this time."
2,disappointed,"I used the Rembrandt 2-hour whitening kit. followed the directions to a T. I only did the upper teeth so I could compare. My teeth got no whiter at all. But, my gums were damaged and very painfull. They hurt for a week and a half. I bought three kits and am afraid to use them again because of the damage that was done to my gums. Plus, my teeth did not whiten!"
1,Didn't Work At All For Me,"I tried this product and followed the instructions exactly. I did not experience any of the pain or irritation reported by other users, but there was no visible whitening of my teeth. Totally worthless product. I don't know why I had such bad results when a few others report significant whitening. Assuming they are not on Rembrandt's payroll, it must be some difference in the type of stains or perhaps mouth chemistry. Or maybe the goop in my package had broken down chemically, though it was well within its sell-by date."
1,Burned my gums,"I followed the directions to the letter. By the time I was on the 3rd 20-min session, I felt like my gums were getting sore, so I didn't do the 4th one. Good thing I quite because the product had burned my gums badly. I had blisters for a week after using this product. It did lighten my teeth a shade or two, but NOT worth the pain!"
3,Eh...,"Put me on the ""so-so"" list for users of this kit. A shade or two whiter was what I got, as evidenced by my digital camera. But I really wanted to get rid of the fluoride marks and nuke the yellow. This kit doesn't do that.Slight irritation and white gum spots happened, but it's temporary."
1,Not worth it,"I have to agree with all the people who said this product gives minimal results. When factoring in how umcomfortable use of the product was, I have to rate this one star and although I did not experience sores or blistering, it took several days for the pain in my gums to fade away. Don't think I've ever had a product cause so much discomfort; really should be off the market."
1,Lowest quality possible,"The gel pieces that came with this are the crappiest I have ever used. I put them in hot water as the instructions stated and as I put them on my teeth they literally ripped. I tried with the other piece and it ripped just as easily, and the water wasn't that hot.I have used other brands and they were much better."
3,Got about 2 shades lighter...,"I used them late last night and fell asleep during the last 20 minute session leaving the tray in over an hour (oops!). My teeth are a couple of shades lighter and understandably a bit sensitive. Overall, I would recommend them to someone looking to boost an already decent smile. I'm going to wait about a week to let the sensitivity subside and give the Crest WhiteStrips a try because I want them a little whiter."
2,Nada,"Just like every other home treatment I've tried - My teeth hurt like hell, my gums have chemical burns and my wallet is a little lighter, but my teeth are not any whiter. I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because It only cost me half as much as the crest white-strips that didn't work either."
4,Best over-the-counter whitener I've ever used!,"I've used the Crest strips, the whitening toothpaste & mouthwash, but I've never gotten as good of results as I did with this product! Also, I found it much easier to go through the tray process over a 2 hour period in one day, rather than remembering to apply the strips daily over multiple weeks. This is a great buy!"
2,I wouldnt recomend,"After using he product I did not see any great improvement. Not only that, but my teeth were in sever pain that started about an hour after I used the product and continued until the next day. If I saw significant results I wouldn't mind the pain, but as it didnt really do anything for me, it was waste of time and suffering for nothing."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"The price is good, the product works but it's not worth it to me. I used 1/2 as much gel as it said to and only used it for 20 minutes on 4 different days. My lower inner lip is blistered and hurts like hell."
3,It's good,It's not the best but for the price it's actually really good. It came on time easily and it didn't cause me any pain at all. Very soothing.
5,Best At-Home Teeth Whitening EVER!,"I have extremely sensitive teeth and gums and had long ago given up on the idea of whitening as it was too painful for me.When I found this great sale, I couldn't pass it up. I purchased this at the promo price of $7.50 a month or so ago.I set aside 2 hours this morning to whiten my teeth which had gotten to a point that I was unhappy with the color even if it would mean a little pain. Boy am I happy that I went through with it!This product did not hurt my teeth or gums AT ALL. There was no pain during the whitening process or after.I used the trays exactly as the directions indicated, although I admit that I didn't use as much of the product as they recommended. I cut the gel use in half.I took before and after shots which I'll be posting shortly at my blog, [ ... ] and have to say that I am VERY happy with the results.My teeth don't hurt a bit and they are a full shade whiter. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend!"
2,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"After being a HUGE fan of Crest whitestrips, I knew I needed to try another product that was a little cheaper. I'll just say, you get what you pay for. The concept is a good idea, but it didn't register to me that within 2 hours, wouldn't my gums be ringing? I did go through with the whole treatment, but after 10 minutes of each application, my gums were so sore. I use Crest 3D white toothpaste, which help my teeth a little bit. (I'm a smoker and a coffee fan). They just needed a little ""help."" I didn't notice a drastic difference that I notice with my usual Crest whitestrips. I don't think I'll be purchasing these again."
4,"Not a super drastic change, but noticeable","I had somewhat yellow teeth. I had been usingRembrandt Deeply White Whitening Mouthwash with Fluoride Fresh Mint, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3). I used that for a while with decent enough results. If anything, it kept my teeth from getting worse. However, I stopped using it and was not taking as good of care of my teeth. I noticed they were getting a bit yellow and decided I needed to fix that. To do so I bought this kit. It seemed like a cheaper option compared with buying Crest White-strips. This is not the easiest product to use but it gives pretty good results. It wasn't a super change. I did not go instantly to pearly whites, but I noticed a difference. It was probably a few shades lighter, at least back to where I was before I started neglecting my teeth. I would recommend this to anyone who has had an issue like mine. It is not the miracle cure, but a solid one-day whitening option."
2,Painful!!!,"Yes I followed the directions but this product burned my gums!!! Hope I don't have any blisters tomorrow. Could only used for an hour, just too painful."
2,Be Careful!,"I gave this product a try after reading good things about it. I can vouch that it does in fact work but be VERY VERY CAREFUL. I followed the directions exactly, but it's possible that I put a little too much gel in the trays. The gel got onto my gums slightly and talk about some serious pain!! My gums were a mess for about 5 days (burnt and bleeding). I've used teeth whitening trays from my dentist in the past and never experienced anything like that."
5,"WOW, it works...My teeth look amazing!","Honestly, I've tried a lot of different whitening products. My next step was going to my Dentist for Zoom whitening treatments. I figured I would have enough money saved up by Spring! I thought I'd try this and am I happy I did. The results are well worth the price. It is easy to apply, first you dip the trays in hot water then pop them in your mouth to form them to your teeth. Then, open two ampules and spread them onto the ""front"" area of the tray and re-insert them for 20 min. Take them out rinse and rinse off tray and wait 10 min, repeat until you have used 4 separate treatments. If you like the effects after two treatments then save the other two for touchups later. I would recommend this to anyone it really does work! Good price, good value and easy to apply."
1,Horrible!! Blisters swollen gums /lips,Used it as directed ..no initial pain...went to bed when i woke up i felt like my mouth was on fire and my lips my gums were completely swollen and red and have big blisters on my upper and lower gums... didnt notice any difference in the whitening either to boot! Product worthless!
2,ouch,"So I just tried this product three days ago and my gums are still burning. I have yellow teeth so was excited to give this a try. I used as directed. By the end my gums felt swollen and on fire and by the next day my teeth were hurting. The tooth pain went away in a day but not the gum pain.In the end it all would have been worth it if I had seen any improvement in my teeth whiteness. I did not. I took ""before and after"" pictures, checked in mirror, they look the same to me as before.I give this 2 stars because I guess the product may help some people but from my experience it just caused pain and cost money."
1,"No noticeable teeth whitening, burns and stain gums white","Does not work, teeth are not any noticeably whiter and entire process was extremely painful. Gel burns and stains your gums white. Took me nearly a week to recover from the gum pains after using this kit."
1,You couldn't pay me to do this again!!!,"I followed all the directions and only used one tube for both upper and lower trays per time. My teeth and gums started to hurt during the second 20 minute session. By the end of the third 20 minute session, I couldn't take it anymore and had to stop. I'm so glad I did. The next morning I woke up with swollen gums with painful sores. I'm still having trouble eating two days later. I know I wasn't able to complete the treatment, but even after three sessions my teeth aren't any whiter. It's just not worth the pain!!! Never had this problem with the Crest strips."
2,Lightened,"Product was 18.99 when I bought it, and it was not worth the money. The whitening strips are much better."
2,Honestly not sure what it did other than cause gum pain.,"Used this as directed, and during the application (within the 2 hours), I wasn't experiencing any irritation, but that evening (4-6 hrs after), all my teeth and gums were aching in that unnerving way where you can't do anything to stop it. Sucking air in would create so much sensitivity, drinking liquids..nothing really subsided the sensitivity. Went to sleep finally, and by the next day the nerve pain was gone, but I'm not sure I sensed any whitening results. Probably will avoid these ""rapid"" whitening kits moving forward :("
1,too good to be true,"Although many have had a different reaction to this product, I say dont risk it!!! The day after using this product (today) my lip is enormously swollen!!!!!!AGGHHH! My lips were not exactly the thinnest to begin with so im not exaggerating! My gums are so red, looks very unhealthy. My teeth saw no considerable whiteningFor the record, I do not suffer from any gum or teeth problems , so this product could have adverse effects on just about anyone. If I couldve given the product no stars I wouldve."
2,"Whitens, but hard to use.","This product was not what I was expecting. I should have read the other reviews before purchase. Although I will say it does whiten, it is so hard to use. The ""gel"" is more of a liquid which sloshes in your mouth and leaves a horrible taste."
1,you're kidding me right ?,"saw the commercials, and decided to give this stuff a try... after two hours I noticed no difference in color. and my mouth is on fire!! if it works for you, congrats. but did nothing for me, sadly."
1,trouble afterwards,"After using this product last night, I was first disappointed in the non results, the pain to lips and gums, and finally waking up to rather large swollen lips making it hard to speak. Horrible experience for me."
4,Worked Great,"I really liked this product. I'm a bit of a tooth whitening fanatic and am always on the prowl for new home ways to get teeth white. I picked this kit up because of the ""2 Hour"" promise for whiter teeth. The gel didn't taste bad at all (a bit minty) but I did have gum sensitivity. The two worst places the gel got my gums was the inside upper part (almost onto the roof of the mouth) and on the tip of my tongue if it touched. Other than that the gel didn't effect anywhere else and the results were subtle but I could notice it right away. It helped if I looked at my teeth before and then after all the applications and noticed the results. However, my front teeth were VERY sensitive the day after and anything I drank (even if it wasn't cold) seemed to go right into the nerves. OUCH!!! But I'm going to defnitely buy this again because the white is noticable and it's a quick way if you want nice results, especially before that photograph or interview."
4,it works!,"The trays in this product work really well. I've always had trouble with the strips sliding out of place because my mouth starts to water. The trays stay in place. Yes, the peroxide still tastes gross, but I had no trouble getting through the two hour session. I noticed a definite improvement, although I was expecting a more dramatic change after two hours."
3,Eh..,"I took pictures after each 20minute session. My teeth were not super white or nasty orange to begin with. I have never whitened my teeth, though I do brush regularly. I dont feel like it did very much for me. It might have gotten a bit whiter, but again, my teeth weren't too discolored. I do not drink coffee or consume foods that are known to stain your teeth. There is enough gel in each application tube to put it on the top and bottom plates, therefore, you can actually use each kit for twice separating each full treatment by 6 months. I will try again in six months. I did not have teeth sensitivity and I did the full 2 hour treatment in one sitting (20 min in, 10 min break x4)."
1,painful BURNS and BLISTERS!,"I hopped online to read reviews of this product when I started experiencing pain during usage of this product. I had to discontinue use during the third tray because of horrible burning on my gums and shooting pains IN my teeth! That was yesterday. Today it feels like I have third degree burns on my gums (they are red and raw with blistering!) and I can hardly stand to brush my teeth. I followed the directions exactly and found it impossible not to get any of the EVIL GEL on my gums. How can this product be called ""safe"" when so many people have reported horrible mouth injuries??? Rembrandt has a money back guarantee and I will be requesting mine today."
1,My teeth aren't any whiter,"I bought this item because it was a gold box discounted item so it was only 8.99. It was a bit inconvienient. I assumed it would be a tray you wear for 2 hours, instead it was 4, 20 minute sessions with a ten minute break in between. The stuff kind of burned my gums and tongue and today, the day after, my gums are still a bit sensitive. After all of this, my teeth aren't any whiter. Im not a coffee drinker or a smoker so I suppose I don't have the surface stains like they might have, but still, I expected some results."
1,Ouch for nothing,"I didn't really notice a difference after doing the 4 rounds. I did 2 one night since I was short on time, and everything felt fine. Then I did the other ones 2 days later. When I put in the last tray my lower gums stung a little, but I thought it was normal and left them on. It felt a little tender, but ok. Now I know that was a big mistake, because the next day I am in agony. I feel like I got punched in the mouth and when I put some anbesol on my gums they stung like crazy until the numb kicked in and my skin started peeling off. It feels like I have canker sores all along the bottom of my gums. I've never had this happen with any other whitening product. I'm getting married in 3 days, so hopefully this doesn't last long or I will not be smiling in any of my pictures because it hurts to smile!"
1,Ouch,"I used this product on Tuesday night. I ignored the burning and stinging on the bottom gums, and used it for the full 20 minutes each of the four times. On Wednesday, my gums were blistered and raw. Thursday (today), I am in fairly intense pain, with continued blistering and sharp pains if I smile, eat, or touch my chin/bottom lip. My teeth are whiter, but I can't smile because of the pain."
3,Very Painful,"Contrary to what some reviers said, the trays were actually rather comfortable if you prepared it well. Very little gel leaked into my mouth during my two hours yesterday. The first hour was uneventful, but my gum started to hurt durinng the second hour, and intensified after it was all done. My neck and shoulders also hurt badly due to nerve connections I guess. I couldn't concentrate on anything for the rest of the day. Fortunately the pain completely went away when I woke up this morning, although my gum is still red and a little swolen.It probably works in terms of whitening, but I will stick to the Crest strips in the future."
5,Sara WOW!,This is a wonderful album. From 1-12 the tracks are at once charming and full of angst....
2,"Highly Overated Book, To Say The Least","This book was recommended in another book I bought about songwriting. Although I thought it seemed a little high for a basic paperback novel type book, I bought it. The book is not very helpful at all. It is organized in a strange way that is somewhat hard to follow. There are much better Rhyming Dictionaries available on Amazon and cheaper for that matter."
5,"Compact, easy to learn to use and very helpful",This rhyming dictionary is perfect for songwriters and poets. It lays out the rhymes by vowel sound and lists identities in the same block. Very quick to find words once you get the hang of it. Great little book.
3,Helpful and fun,"As a writer and collector of dictionaries, I find this book both interesting and useful. It starts the poetic juices flowing."
2,The Complete Rhyming Dictionary,"It has a lot of information in it, but I find the book very confusing. It does not really help me."
1,I want my money back!,"Being a lyricist (ck. home.earthlink.net/~paulkruger), I've been using Wood's Unabridged Rhyming Dictionary for so many years the book has begun to fall aprt. (Never realized till a few weeks ago, the edition I have was published in 1943.) It was time to replace it. Or so I thought.Clement Wood's genius was to divide each section so that you could see at a glance words which have the same sound (e.g., approved, improved, reproved, etc.) and, therefore, were not true rhymes. So what does this appallingly dreadful edition do? They list all words alphabetically regardless of sound!No wonder one of the editors is named Bogus."
1,Incompetent and Insufferable,"In _The Poet's Craft Book_ that begins this edition, we're treated to an absurd dissertation on why 'north' and 'forth' don't rhyme. In the rhyming dictionary, you won't find 'north' and 'forth' as rhymes either. You will find 'gone' rhymed with 'John' and not with 'dawn.' I don't know what dialect of English the editor speaks, but it isn't mine, and it isn't standard American broadcast English, either. It wouldn't be quite so annoying without the preposterous hautiness of the section on incorrect rhymes in _The Poet's Craft Book_--while the dictionary rhymes 'miniature' and 'moor.'"
2,prefer the earlier edition,"It's very sad that vital books have to be ""updated"" and ""revised"" to accomodate the writing careers of persons unable to create vital books themselves. Some of the original Clement Woods comes through here, but see if you can get hold of the earlier edition instead.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
1,Too Complicated,"You're writing a poem or song. You've got one word, and want a rhyming word. So you need a rhyming dictionary. Look up the word you know and find other rhyming words. How simple does it get? Well with this dictionary - forget it. This is arranged NOT alphabetically by word, but by vowel ""sound"". They have transformed what should be a simple process into a chore."
5,Cool book for kids,"Well edited, nice photos. Kids who enjoy learning about animals should enjoy this book."
2,Recycle,"This CD, in nice terms, is a piece of junk. If you already bought Bad Boy's 10th anniversary Hits collection, you don't need this. Some of the songs are the same... and most of the other one's you probably already own. For the most part the songs that are on it are great Rnb Classics, but the CD is a short 12 songs, and doesn't even remotely encompass BadBoy's RnB Hits. The Dvd is even worse, only having 7 videos on it. Save your money and Buy BadBoy's 10th Anniversery: The Hits instead."
5,Bad Boy R&B Hits. Still Strong and still very much alive!,"This albulm is bananas p.diddy has always done something great when its come to Bad boy, music and working with his artists. This albulm is no exception, which brings in some of his most talented artists and their hit songs all in one cd. Real Love with Mary J. Blidge and Biggie has to be a classic and all the others song are awesome as well. Relive the past with some of these old joints and some of these new joints which will continue to reign supreme as some of the top songs of r&b history. Ill say this once if you dont got this albulm go cop it today."
5,Perfect,I so love that boy lol and this is the completion of all the cd's that I have.it is the best songs some great artist and I love it!
5,One of the best Bad Boy albums yet!,I think this album is great! The songs are good and so are the people who do the songs. The order the songs are in on the album is good because the songs are in an organized order not skipping around from style to style. Good lyrics + Good artists = Great CD which is what I think this CD is.
3,A supplement to the book,"I bought ""Killing Pablo,"" the video, to show to my world geography class as we studied South America. It was a good video, and it facilitated a fantastic discussion about how far the United States should go to protect its interests. (i.e. Should we off Osama bin Laden? What about Saddam Hussein? In a ""war on terrorism,"" what is acceptable?)There were two big problems with it, though. First, it focused very heavily on how Pablo was actually captured, as opposed to the evils that he committed before his capture. By the end of the 40-minute video, he seems a little bit more like a victim than a mass-murdering drug trafficker. I had to spend some time in class prior to the video outlining and emphasizing what a bad guy Pablo was. Second, and of equal importance in a classroom, the sound was very bad. It was often difficult to understand what was being said by the people in the video, outside of the main speaker."
5,"If you are interested in book collecting or book history, this is a must-read","Very well documented (though not overly academic in nature). A must-read for book enthusiasts and (obviously) for book collectors. Many illustrations, most of them of good quality and in colours complement an entertaining and informative text. I wished for a book like this for a long time before discovering it. You won't regret it."
2,"NATIONAL, NOT INTERNATIONAL","IN OPERA, SOME WORKS ARE VALUABLE BECAUSE OF THEIR PLACE AND SIGNIFICANCE IN A NATIONAL MUSICAL CANON, BUT THEY DO NOT TRAVEL WELL. I MEAN, THEY FAIL TO CAPTURE LISTENERS THE WAY THE GREAT OPERAS OF EVERY COUNTRY DO. THIS IS THE CASE WITH THE LANTERN. THE SINGERS ARE ALL EXCELLENT AND SO IS THE CONDUCTING . . . BUT I FOUND THE MUSIC BORING AND AT TIMES ALMOST UNLISTENABLE. I HAVE JUST DISCOVERED THE LIKES OF FIBICH AND NOVAK, LOVE THEIR SYMPHONIC AND CHAMBER MUSIC, BUT CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAVE REMAINED IN THE BACKGROUND WHEN COMPARED TO THE TWO CZECH MUSICAL GIANTS, DVORAK AND JANACEK."
2,So little for so much...,"An incredible amount of information (over 600 pages) yet it doesn't cover the most important. Other Chilton/Haynes books go into some depth about trobleshooting and maintenance, yet this one sorely lacks in troubleshooting. The back cover suggests it does. However, after several hours of thumbing through the index and book itself I still have a car on jacks in my front driveway and a very sore thumb."
2,"Too much, to little, to late for me....","This book lacked the indepth knoledge I have grown to look for in a book by Chilton. Too many cars for one book and the info seems to be mixed up slightly. NO troubleshooting charts as is said on the back cover, so my last thought is this book is very misleading."
2,not what I expected,there is little hard knowledge in this book to assist you with major stuff. Now what I expected at all from Chilton's.
1,???,"Even expert mechanic have a hard time understanding this book. How can you make one book that covers all ""cars""? I think I'll stick with hayens books."
3,I seemed to sleep better and didn't feel ...,"I seemed to sleep better and didn't feel drowsy at all. I woke up feeling fine -- I liked that part. I just wish they had more information on the bottle. I didn't even know what the product was for -- just the dose! Except for the little moon picture, I wouldn't have known what it was for without doing my own research. I would like it if the bottle had more information and a description of what it's for."
1,Bang Gun,This fell apart after a couple minutes of opening it. Don't waste your money its cheaply made. Hate Hate Hate it.
4,Joker Costume,"Bought this for the joker costume good quality, but my son didn't use it because he said the joker carried a knife."
2,"Really low quality, only good for pictures","This gun is really low quality. I thought it would break before pictures could be taken. The price should have been 50 cents, maybe 1 buck at the most."
3,flag bang gun,"I bought this product to be used as a prop in a skit and not as a toy. I would not recommend it as a toy. For a child, the metal pieces may be harmful and the gun itself seems flimsy. For my purpose, though, it is excellent. The snap catch releases the flag immediately and it is extremely easy to put back together for the next shot. No directions come with the product, but it is self-explanatory when you see it. The guns came sealed in a plastic wrap and were in perfect condition."
3,"Cute, Funny, but Cheap Quality","This is what it is... It's a toy gun that goes ""Bang"" (via a flag) just like in the cartoons. My son wanted it, and he was happy with it. The quality was cheap, but it's cute and it made my 11 year old happy."
1,Dollar store quality,"I can't believe I wasted 5$ on this when it is something that belongs at the dollar store, it is tiny, and easily breakable."
1,Better off going to the dollar store,Very flimsy and not worth the online order. I got this as a gag gift but felt cheaper that the couple of dollars I spent on it. You could find something better at the dollar store and not wait for it in the mail.
2,Smaller than I thought it would be,This is much smaller than described in ad. But I'm sure it will work well as a stocking stuffer. Got
4,Cheap Legal Fun,"It's a neat little piece with tons of potential for mischief. The price is affordable and certainly worth it.(P.S., It gets borring after about a month)"
4,pretty cool,this thingy was pretty cool fun to shoot with and play with friends not very durable but has not broken. overall pretty cool toy for young kids
4,classic toy,I used this as a prop for my Halloween costume this year and it really added that something extra to my costume. After several uses it just kept popping open on it's own which was kind of annoying but I just had to re-shape the trigger and it was fine again. Everyone loved the gun and I was even able to trick several people with it! Overall it served its purpose and it's a classic toy. Everyone was surprised I was even able to find one! (Thanks Zowie Fun!!)The quality is cheap but hey..it's like 2 bucks!
4,BANG! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!,"I purchased this BANG gun in 2008 to go with my Joker Halloween costume. It's pretty decent. Stuff the flag inside the folding metal barrel, pull the trigger, and BANG!!!!! (except there's no sound, of course). Every Joker should have this in his arsenal. Well, almost every Joker (Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight didn't use gadgets such as this, unfortunately).Overall, a pretty good product that will add to the fun of being The Joker."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun","this gun is so much fun. i love seeing people freak out until they realize it's a gag.Pros:easy to uselots of fungreat for joker costumescons:it does not seem very durable, and might breakit is not as large as the photo makes it appear, it is actually the size of a derringerbut overall it's fun, cheap, and came sooner than predicted."
5,One of America's best singer-songwriters,"Carrie can bond with a live audience or a listener to her CDs with equal ease. Her music is complex and simple at the same time, like warm coffee with a hit of bourbon. Carrie seems to have the uncanny ability to look into humanity's soul and find the tender parts. If you like Elizabeth Mitchell (of Ida), Nanci Griffith, or John Prine...take a listen."
3,g8orguy,"Carrie's very talented theres no doubt. I love her other stuff. But say what you will, BEST-OF's SUCK. Buy her other CDs!"
1,Bummer Case,"I unfortunately purchased this thinking since it said this was for the Oster classic clipper it would be made just for the clipper. Actually the cardboard box works better than this case.In addition to this case I purchased the classic Oster 76 cutter and the Oster attachment combs. There isn't room for the cutter, comb attachments and cord. The case is too small and not great quality for the price although it does say Oster on the side. Not recommended. Buy another case or bag from somewhere else. A shave kit bag would be better."
1,You WONT get what you pay for !!,"The dimensions on the one they sent me are 8""x12""x3"" ..... NOT 10x9.8x19.6 as stated on this page !! Can other people that bought this PLEASE measure yours and tell me what size you received ? This is NOT what i expected !UPDATE: I complained to Amazon and was ASSURED that they would send the BIGGER case (there WAS another case offered for about $13.00 and description said 8""x12""x3"") well, once again, I was sent the SMALL Oster Clipper Case..If YOU buy this Case, you WILL get one that measures 8x12x3 ... NOT 10x9.8x 19.6 as listed on page... Amazon offered me a $6.00 credit.. exactly what the smaller case would have cost !I am NOT happy... They have removed the smaller case sold by another vendor, instead of fixing the product info on this product. BEWARE !!!!!!!!!!"
1,cheap and poorly designed,"This is supposedly a custom storage case for the relatively expensive hair clipper and attatchments that I bought at the same time. Instead, it is a cheap, crappy blow-molded plastic thing like one would expect to pay a buck for at a poorly attended flea market. The clippers kind of fit only if you don't mind tossing them in haphazardly with a wadded up cord. Forget about anything else fitting; it will only fall out when you open the case or be flipped out when you remove the clippers. You'd be better off storing everything in a worn out sock."
2,The clipper case was not what I hoped for.,"The inner dimensions are a lot different from the outer dimensions. Yes, my oster clipper fit in it, but not the attachable comb heads. My finishing clippers would fit in with it, if neither had cords on them. It is well made, but don't be fooled by the outside dimensions."
1,A waste,"This product may be made for a single Oster clipper, but it was most likely a prototype that someone thought they could get a couple of bucks for. Put an adequate picture on line and some organized knuckle head like me will buy it to keep his clippers in order. Live and learn. I store my 76 in there while I look for something to actually store both of my clippers and attachments."
3,Nice storage unit,"I wish that this case was just a little bigger. With the way it is designed inside, it is sometimes hard to close unless you have the cord just right on your trimmer"
4,Oster Carrying Case,"Oster Case is very useful and quite convenient. Had previously been storing the Clipper and accessories in their original boxes and over the years, as you can well imagine, they had become somewhat degraded. With the Carrying Case, things are now neat and easily stored with all of the necessary items in one place, very convenient. Just grab and go. My one recommendation would be; the case should be modified to include a place for the Oster Clipper lubricating oil."
2,To Small.,"I purchased this case to store my Oster Clippers and Oster Trimmers. It is a very tight fit. It can only comfortably fit one or the other, so it defeats the purpose of keeping things safe because it takes up to much room for multiple boxes. I do however like it for sending my clippers away to get sharpened, but again, I could only send one."
2,Get Value Investing Today out of the library,"I recently purchased Value Investing Today hoping to find a book that would give me information on how to select value stocks. Instead, what I found was a book that just skimmed the surface on value investing. The interesting part about the book was its emphasis on foreign stocks as value investments. But then the book went into detail as to accounting differences between countries - squashing the idea that an individual could pick single foreign stocks. I think this book would be good for someone who had no idea what value investing was and just wanted to get a broad overview of the subject / technique. I would not recommend this book to someone who was looking for any kind of in depth information. While this book did have some interesting / valuable pieces of information, I don't see it as a book that an investor would refer to often. My suggestion: Get the book out of the library and read it once."
5,Explains simply modern value investing.,"Successful money manager, Charles Brandes, explains in plain language the important lessons taught by Benjamin Graham. He lays out simply how to screen companies for inclusion in an optimal portfolio, how to construct a portfolio, and how the patient investor can achieve extraordinary returns. Importantly, he demystifies foreign investing and builds on Graham's tenets with a thoughtful discourse on international security analysis. He makes an important case for a heavy weighting in non-US equities, and he defends his case for a 100% position in common equities to the exclusion of preferred equities and bonds. ""Value Investing Today"" is a must-read for the long-term wealth builder."
3,I really like Chapter 4.,"This book doesn't say much of anything new that you can't get from multitude of other sources. However, it summarizes value and safety criteria pretty well in chapter 4. This is why I would recommend this book."
1,Torture of the Naked Eye Double Feature Headache!,"One star for what could have been a 3 star shlock cheeze fest.Both of these movies are tediously bad ,but I could tell that there might have been potential for a few laughs,had I been able to actually view anything on screen!The material used for transfer is god awful!Washed out and faded!Played out crappy VHS tapes stored in the worse conditions are my guess is what they used when they put this garbage on DVD.Total rip off!One big red and orange blur is all I could make out!I have already returned this rip off back to seller!Don't let the cover artwork fool you into thinking your going to have any fun with purchasing this dissapointing product!"
2,Naked Torture Double Feature,"This has to be the worst quality of any dvd i've ever seen, and I own over 2000 of them. Flesh Feast is unwatchable, you can barely tell what's going on in the movie. Three on a Meathook has some good moments and the picture is slightly better then Flesh Feast. I'd avoid this set because of the picture, it's so bad."
1,What The.......,"All I can say is the quality of the movie has to be one of the worst transfers out there. I read the other reviews and I thought people have to be warned about this dvd,it's soooo bad. It's like watching an old vhs tape on a vcr with dirty heads. The price for this cheap but it's still overpriced. Do yourself a favor stay away from this disc."
4,Classis Dispenser III Review,It works fine except for one of the bottles won't express hair conditioner. Just added water to it and now it works as it should.
2,Do you want to lose yours too?????!!!!!,"This is the worst product you can buy because you will lose it soon after you put it in your key chain. The cap is made of cheap plastic that will break extremely easily. I lost mine 2 weeks after I bought it - What a bunch of cheap engineers, it's as if they designed to be lost - sad thing I will never buy a memorex product - they should stick to CDs!"
2,messy no matter what,"Grape seems like an excellent flavor for toothpaste. And perhaps it is. However, the liquid toothpaste cannot be gotten cleanly from the container, and it glops up around the dispensing hole. Even if I wasn't a neat toothpaste freak, this would be a problem, as it becomes more and more difficult to close the lid.We won't buy any more of this product."
4,Just a charger at a good price,"After losing my verizon lg VX8300 charger i looked online for a replacement. i chose this one over others because of its obscenely low price. It was shipped to my house in 2-3 days which made me very happy. Now the charger it self, to me, is not a fantastic charger. but it is great for what your paying for. Pros - it chargers and works fine. Cons- shorter cord then i'm used to, found a couple times it wasn't charging when i woke up. a new charger at my verizon store was $20 i believe, i paid (with shipping)roughly $3 for this one. All in all its worth it, my cons are just small annoyances to me and nothing major. Not bad at all."
1,Verizon LG VX8300 VX5300 Travel/Home/Wall Battery AC Charger (110-240v),"The charger does not fit the phone. The insert on the charger is slightly larger than the receiver on the phone and will not plug in. The order came in a timely manner, but I cannot use it. I ordered another one from Newegg."
2,Not Accurate,"The charger did not fit one of the phones listed, the LG VX8300. That was the phone for which I needed a charger. It turns out that LG VX8300 and LG VX5300 use the same battery so I charge the battery in the VX5300 and then swap it out with the low battery in the VX8300. It's not the most convenient, but it works.Verizon LG VX8300 VX5300 Travel/Home/Wall Battery AC Charger (110-240v)"
5,Great!,"Came right on time, and works fine! Price is very fair! Im very glad i ordered this product, its hard to find an old phone charger like this in a store."
1,don't waste your time with this,"The seller did refund the $2.80, but you might want to know that this charger does not fit VX8300. Also, it is cheaply made, very light and does not look like it would hold up well for long. The company was late in delivery."
5,Verizon LG VX8300 VX5300 Travel/Home/Wall Battery AC Charger (110-240v),This product is exactly what I wanted and at a very low price. Second item I've purchased from these people. Good service.
4,Good value,It was as described. New item with fast shipping. Very similiar to Verizon's model. Good value for generic charger.
1,This item was not good,The Verizon charger I got for my daughter quit working a week after she got it. It would no longer charge her phone. Definitely poor quality.
1,HORRIBLE,"Very slow delivery, I needed my phone wihin two days at least and thats what i was promised. My phone was delivered to me a week later and when it came It didnt fit! Nice package, bad delivery speed, not a good product."
1,Verizon wall charger that doesn't fit,product came in a timely manner ! But the prongs that were susposed to fit the charging port were to wide for the vx 5300 ? R they 2 different sizes ? product did not fit !
4,Can't beat it for the price.,"This is an old phone. How much do you really want to spend for yet another charger (because you left your other one at someone's house....). This does charge the phone although it was a little bit difficult to insert the end piece into the bottom of the phone. If you do it gently, it will fit in - don't try to force it. It was as described on Amazon. It arrived when it said it would and was packaged appropriately."
2,NOT VERY GOOD,IF YOU CAN I SAY BUY SOMETHING ELSE.THE CHARGER DOES NOT WORK WITH EVERYTHING. AND HAS NOWAY OF TELLING IF IS GOOD OR BAD.
4,A Good Book Motivational Book,"I read this book rather quickly but still found that it had some great insights on how to be successful and how to be the best that you can be. It is written by Pat Riley, one of the NBAs greatest coaches. It is known that as a coach, Pat Riley knew how to get the best out of his players and bring them to their fullest potential.This book contains tips on how to achieve that. It gives the reader a great work ethic. I highly recommned this book to everyone looking to reach their fullest potential in business and in life."
4,"""There is no I in team""","This book was recommended to me and I picked it up and dove right in, it is a moral and spiritual self help type book.The story is in autobiographical style and mostly has tips and tricks on how to win as part of a team yet this can also be used by the individual. The author's famous quote, ""Show your enemy how much you respect them by having no respect at all"" is supported throughout with actual scenarios of what happened in the locker rooms, and what the players were feeling both on nights they won and nights they lost.The author also details minor personal struggles and the methods he used to overcome them and gain greater respect for God.Details his successful career with the Lakers, Knicks and Heat and the special mentoring that Magic Johnson had to get to help win those titles in LA for the Lakers. Overall a very uplifting book. Recommend...Aryan Somers"
5,Pat Riley has written an excellent business management book,"When I am asked by business counterparts to describe my favorite business philosophy, I give them a copy of Mr. Riley's book. When applied to Sports, it obviously works. When applied to business, it profoundly works. We live in a day and age when the word ""I"" is used to exhaustion. This book allows one to feel honor in teamwork -- in promoting and supporting the efforts of the entire business group, and shows us how personally rewarding the dynamics of being on a great business team can be. Excellent!"
3,A Game Plan for Team Players,"Pat Riley, one of the NBA's all-time great coaches, presents his game plan for winning and consciously creating success. Riley sometimes gets a little preachy, but he is an extremely focused individual, and explains how his principles and team motivation methods have made him a winner."
4,Great photographs,Great color photographs of the Berghof and it's inhabitance. Worth it for the pictures even if you don't read German.
2,After a few chapters the main characters became irritating .,"I thought I would enjoy this book, especially after reading the reviews, which were so favorable. Justine was really self-centered, whiny and a real snot. Reading this book was as enjoyable as root canal. The author used too many cultural stereotypes and generalizations."
3,All Over The Place,"The book wasn't horrible, but half the time I did not know who was doing what and where. The time line was bad, it would take a while to figure out if the charactors were in the present or past. Also who were all these other people that I did not care one bit about. I did not know how they where related to the main charactors at all. Except that they were in the book and somehow had some connection with them, BUT WHAT. It was an easy read and not the worst book I ever read. It is perfect for the summer. Just a book to take up time and it will not make you think in anyway at all. Which is sometimes all you need."
1,Reads like a bad sitcom.,"Loathsome characters, insipid language, simplistic writing and absent comic timing make this novel read like the insufferable network pilot that gets cancelled after one episode. The only thing missing from this canned, tiresome, overwrought narrative sitcom is the laugh track. Too bad, because without it I can't tell which parts are supposed to be funny."
1,What might have been,"What an insipid waste. . . ugly characters, boring story. For a book with rave reviews, this was a big flop. Let's hope Valerie Block learns to write something interesting next time."
2,"Sorry, didn't get it","Set in Manhattan, where driven lawyer Valerie and marketing exec. Barry are thrown together in a near-death airplane experience where they share a barf-bag, I found this book reeking with characters that I wouldn't give the time of day. It was supposed to be a romantic comedy. I laughted at a few parts but mostly found myself continuing just to kill time while I waited for another book to become available at my library. I actually despised the main character Justine, more than the others. And couldn't care less if the two got married or killed each other off. Although I put in the time, I didn't even finish the last 80-pages.NOTE-Although I genuinely did not enjoy this book, truth be told that I've just come off of Janet Evanovich's first 8 books in her Stephanie Plum series. I found Evanovich so funny, she may have ruined me for all other authors attempting humor."
1,Annoying at best,"I made it to page 82, then came here to read the reviews to see if it was going to get any better. I didn't like any of the characters.And the choppy stylejumping back and forthbetween past and presentand unlikeable peoplewas very annoying.I found myself not caring about their petty dramas and superficial angst. So glad to see my gut feeling was right, it's a real stinker.Thanks to the reviews here I won't waste anymore time on this dreary book."
3,Was it just me....?,"Was it just me, or did other people really hate the character of Justine? I found her to be cold and calous and overall somewhat shallow. I could really sympathize with Barry and the angst he was feeling of being in his mid-thirties and unattached. I think Ms. Block's book was well written, however, I could not fully understand what Barry saw in Justine. I wish she had spent more time fleshing out some of the other characters. I think she did a good job of depicting the crisis that many professional 30 something year olds face today, finding themselves unattached with little time outside of their careers of meeting people."
3,Nothing intelligent but highly entertaining,"I fell into this book so easily and was a bit sad when I finished it. The story is a no-brainer but interesting nonetheless because we've all gone through it. The one aspect I didn't cater to was that Justine becomes altered and exchanges (supposedly from an epiphany) all the things she wanted for things less rewarding. I'm tired of strong women always compromising their careers and not quite reaching the top. But overall, I would recommend this to a friend who's interested in light reading that she can't put down."
2,"Sorry, just didn't get it","Set in Manhattan, where driven lawyer Justine and marketing exec. Barry are thrown together in a near-death airplane experience where they share a barf-bag, I found this book reeking with characters that I wouldn't give the time of day.

1,How about an option for NO STARS !,"Simply put....I believe this may be one of the worst mainstream books I have ever read.It pains me to even think of this story so I'll just offer a few better recommendations instead. Try a either Watermelon or Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married by Marian Keyes for the ""comic urban romance"" as it should be done."
4,Amusing NY romance,"After reading the other reviews and the ""I don't get it"" reviews, I felt I had to add my two cents. I found this 30-something novel at my 92 year old mother's Assisted Living home and was amused to find this type of novel in that setting! Wonder how it got there? At any rate, the characters ARE prickly, but who said everyone has to be nice all the time. A lot of us have tics and quirks, and these two were no exception. I enjoyed reading what it's like for unmarried New Yorkers in their 30's, and thought Valerie Block did a great job for a first time novel. OK, it's not going to last as a Great Novel, but it was fun and amusing, and held my interest throughout. It helps if you're Jewish, too, to understand the angst. Obviously she's improved as she's gone along, and the next two novels were better received (more stars) than the first. Keep on going, Valerie!"
2,"Fast, easy reading","Overall I liked the book but whoa! WAY too many characters were introduced! Didn't know who to keep track of at first, who was important to know. Justine and Barry went back and forth a little too much for me. One moment it was right, the next it was wrong. It was frustrating! Also, I was disappointed with the lack of conclusion to the Vince character, he just disappeared. It was a decent read overall but I'm sure there are better books out there. The author definitely has potential."
3,a true summer read,"This was a fun book for summer, especially if you live in New York. It's a quick and easy read, well-written, with some interesting characters. The only problem is, they aren't likable in the least! Both were neurotic, self-absorbed, egotistical characters. I wanted them to get together in the end (and of course, there is never any doubt that they will) but only because they deserve eachother. And I wanted them out of the dating pool for the rest of us!!!"
2,Why read a book about people you don't like?,"This was an easy read, which was the only reason why I finished it. I didn't like any of the characters. They were obnoxious and boring. Why the two protagonists fall in love is not understandable, they are both so annoying. Most of the supporting characters are worse. If the writer could come up with some likeable characters for her next book it might be fun because she has a rather readable style."
4,"Witty, sharp and thoroughly addictive","I absolutely enjoyed this book! Ms. Block captured the spirit of big-city, professional, 30-somethings who are striving to leave their mark careerwise while finding fulfillment in their personal lives. Achieving that perfect balance is most often as crazy and tragically funny a search as that of Justine and Barry's. The only fault I find with this book is not letting us see what happened with the roommate...maybe a sequel?"
1,Was it something she wrote?,"The author is obviously a great writer, she shows style and potential, but why did she invent the most incredibly obnoxious and shallow characters I've ever read? Justine was the worst one, she's someone I wouldn't be friends with if she were real. Barry was not any better. The only decent character there was Pipa, but hardly interesting. Don't bother reading this book---read In the Drink or Otherwise Engaged instead."
1,I kept waiting for it to get better but it only got worse.,"What a disappointment. The characters have absolutely no depth, they are all superficial, shallow, and worst of all--artifical. They were down right annoying! I didn't want to get to know them or delve futher into their situation."
1,Unlikable characters = Lackluster novel,"Though the writer tried to make the characters realistic and portray an honest snapshot of the beginning phases of a relationship, she portrayed both of the characters as so painfully unlikable that they became repulsive.That being said, why would anyone care if they actually find love together? It's about as appealing as a wet dog. As one reviewer said, please, do not waste your money."
1,Random notes about 2 annoying people,"This book did not do anything for me. Both characters were so incredibly annoying, I found it a chore to read. I guess that's true love, they deserve each other."
4,a very funny quick read,"From the opening pages, when the two protagonists meet, get sick and start to fall in love during a plane crash, I laughed out loud and knew I would enjoy this book. A sarcastic and funny look at neurotic but well-meaning New York yuppies searching for love, this book is a quick and enjoyable read, perfect for a plane ride (no joke) or vacation. Reading Block's book is like listening to a very witty friend tell her hilarious, and poignant, account of her rocky road to love. I'm looking forward to this first-novelist's next effort."
2,Not as good as I expected it to be,"The characters are completely annoying and unlikeable in this book. For some reason, though, I kept reading until the end. It didn't get any better as I read. I'm just glad I didn't buy it - someone else gave it to me. I'd have been really ticked off if I paid money for this one."
1,Don't bother!,"I got halfway through ""Was It Something I Said"" and realized that I didn't feel as if I ""knew"" any of the characters and what I did know of them, I did't like. The storyline was choppy (the transitions from present to past and back again were confusing) and the character development was weak. It seemed like an interesting plot but Block failed to deliver on substance."
3,Should Have Been Better,"I liked the story okay and this is indeed a very believable New York story. If taken at face value, the book is pretty good, but I found it didn't capture the reader's interest enough. Some of the subplots (Vince and Pippa) were not fully fleshed out. The writer should just have focused on Justine and Barry. And also, these two people are not the most likeable, and it has nothing to do with imperfections. They are downright annoying."
2,An unappealing character spoils the novel for me,"The story sets out on an intereting note, but after the plane crashes, it seems to plunge as well. I've never seen a character as obnoxious and annoying as Justine, and I found her attitude destestable. I found muself grumbling and shaking my head in disgust whenever she says something to spite Barry, Pippa, her mother or whoever gets on her nerves. Perhaps being opinionated can sometimes come across as being witty, but in Justine's case, she is just plain angry. And after a few doses of her sarcasm, it becomes tired. I also have to agree with the reader who thinks that too much space was devoted to the work scenes, when in fact, they are not that vital to the plot. All in all, apart from some funny and clever exchanges between characters, I found this novel tedious and hard to finish."
5,This about the only map of Morocco I could find in the USA -- and it is almost impossible to get!!,"It's an excellent map, very serviceable both for planning a trip and trekking through Morocco. I wanted 2, one for me and for my partner. They were only able to deliver one. You couldn't even get it from Rough Guide itself. I presume all the commpanies are making new maps -- but still, I don't understand it. I understand maps are easy to get in Europe, but Europeans go to Morocco with much greater frequency that US citizens -- so it may be a market demand issue.But if you can get this map -- grab it... it probably is one that was left in some warehouse somewhere."
1,Fight truth with Bunk?,"Apparently, the only way that desperate, fringe atheists can cobble together an argument against Christianity is to use bunk. Not even academics who hate Christianity would stake their reputation against the archeological evidence we already have for the beginnings of Christianity, altho they might dispute it's theology and conclusions.Dross."
1,Doesn't know what he's talking about.,"This guy claims that the gospels in the Bible were written in the second century AD. This claim is a load of crap. We have extremely early texts dating back to circa 50 AD (Mark) to circa 70 AD (John). We also have records from ROMAN source that talk of a man called Christus (don't take me word for word on this) being crucified in Jerusalem (dating approximately 30 AD). As for science shaking Christianity's foundation, we have evidence far to the contrary. That though, is another discussion for another time."
4,Prehistorik Man Should Be Treated Better,This game is highly doubted by many people. I went to the store and got it for 10.00 bucks! It should of been at least 20. This game is so much fun. Its also quite hillarious. Yet it is so cheap! A great game to add to your library. The sound effects are amazing and the graphics are not even close to cheesy. Their great. This game deserves more credit. A GREAT GAME! Simple hard in some ways but great fun!
4,Two boys' review: New Batman villian is sparking fun,"The Firefly is a new villian from ""The Batman"" animated TV show. What makes this action figure so fun to play with is the backpack that fires sparks (don't worry -- it is perfectly safe)!This is a fully articulated action figure by Mattel. Don't purchase the collector's version. You can find affordable versions at a better price that are intended for kids to play with rather than stack up in a glass case."
2,""" a fanatical searcher after muck""","A lot of research but the ultimate goal seems to be character assassination, and a totally spurious association with Ian Paisley ( I suppose that helps book sales to the prurient public). Van has been exemplary in avoiding getting embroiled in the Troubles and this seems to be a belated effort to drag him into the mire.The author's judgement of Van's output seems equally flawed - Warm Love is dismissed whereas some of the more turgid later stuff is praised. There is also far too much repetition.Who is Johnny Rogan?"
1,Disappointed Van Fan!,"Ok, this is definitely a bias opinion from a Van fan. I love Van's music and tried to find a good biography. Since this was a recently new book that came out and it had 400+ pages of details I just assumed that I would be equally interested as any fan would. Rogan's vocabulary is quite nicely written for anyone who can appreciate literature however I found it to be a difficult read. And I do read a good amount of books. Unfortunately the book has way more detail about what was going on at the time than Van himself. It seems like Rogan likes to set the scene but ends up going on tangents that feel like you wasted your time and hard earned money. Unfortunately I didn't get past the first few chapters as the details got too unbearably dull for me."
3,"STICK TO THE BYRDS, JOHNNIE!","Interesting read, although Mr. Rogan includes so much information about the Troublesin Northern Ireland that the book is almost a history of the Catholic/Protestantconflict, as well as a Van Morrison's biography. Half way through, I just started to skip the sections about Northern Ireland. That stuff is too complicated anyway. I mean, I'm wanting to learn about Van Morrison. If I want to learn about the Northern Ireland conflict, I'll read a book solely dedicated to that subject.It's like trying to read a biography of Abraham Lincoln that has a bunch of information regarding the growing of corn in Illinois interspersed through it. Yes, Van Morrison grew up in Northern Ireland and had friends and family there, but early on his music career took him to England and then the States before the Troubles began. Maybe Mr. Rogan was getting paid by the page."
3,Hugg-A-Pillow,"Very Disappointed in the firmness, it feels like it doesn't have enough stuffing. If you a looking for a FIRM Hugg a Pillow then this is not the pillow for you.!!"
3,Just an OK printer,"Decent for just a draft printer, but I have had inkjets that had sharper graphics and colors. If you need a cheap printer that works for printing out draft pages, the price is good. If you need photo quality and report-style prints, move to a higher line of HP printers."
2,Scrappy Printer,"Bought this printer about two years ago.Printed rather good text and pictures.Then,I did not know what happened,but the printer sucked the paper into it,causing it to jam and overheat,resulting in a blown fuse.Getting it repaired would be way too expensive,so I bought a brand new printer.This is a piece of junk.Do not ever ever buy it"
2,mac compatible???,"Amazon, when you decide to label something 'mac compatible', please check whether this is indeed the case. I spent $50 on this printer, only to find that it didn't work with my computer."
4,Heavy duty pan.....,"I really like this pan...it is heavy and definitely will not warp...the silicone handles on the edges and the extra large rims make taking this item out of the oven very easy....the only negative I have is that I used a metal...probably my fault....spatula to take out a piece of meatloaf and it scratched the bottom....I was surprised at this, because I didn't think I pressed that hard to get such a noticeable scratch....nylon or silicone would have prevented this most likely."
4,Not Bad,"By far the most comfortable safety glasses I've worn, so much so that I sometimes forget I have them on. I'm not sure if they're polarized, but they have a better tint than a pair I purchased from home depot for an astronomical price. I deal with LCD meters all day at work and unlike the polarized pair, these do not ""rainbow"" the display. Overall very satisfied with this product."
3,OK safety glasses for six bucks,"First, they fit well and are comfortable. Good coverage from flying stuff. I probably have a larger-than-average face.The yellow rubber temples are quite comfortable.They have no ""frame"" surrounding the lens...to me, this makes them feel flimsy.Also, they are not as dark as I'd like. I often use safety glasses which double as full-on sun glasses...these are really not dark enough for that.I paid [...] with free shipping and they are probably worth about that."
2,"OK, but...","Lasted about 4 months, I would guess. I loved them up until the day the henge broke. The screw inside the henge was rusted to almost nothing. The plastic looked like it had material fatigue. Didn't break just kinda, well, dissolved/crumbled. I cannot believe that my sweat is anymore toxic than that belonging to anyone else."
2,Nice while they lasted,"Glasses were lightweight and comfortable while they lasted. Wore them for 3 days while installing my patio 4th of July week. Unfortunately they cracked right between the lense / nose bridge as I was cleaning them with my shirt. I was treating glasses very gently compared to my regular cheap sunglasses I buy too. In fact, I was going to try gluing the crack but they broke completely through so I've tossed them already.Overall impression of the product was good before they broke, as they weren't too darkly tinted and allowed me to see project details without taking the glasses off. They were lightweight and looked good on my mug. Very dissapointed they turned out to be so fragile, especially for safety glasses!"
5,they work great,they are better thin the ones i paid 30 for at lowes lasted longer to i don't have anything else to say but you have to wright so much
5,"comfortable to wear, look decent","These are smaller looking and I was initially worried when I got them because although I am a medium-large framed 5'5"" woman I have a fat head! These fit me perfectly and comfortably. They are not too tight or too loose. And although they are small they can be comfortably worn close to the face so that I feel fully protected. The tinting is enough for working in south Florida sun (on a white gravel yard no less) and not soo much so that I can't see when I step into the shed. If you are an extra large man these might be a little small for you but I think even averaged sized (6ft 180lbs) guys could wear these just fine. Great price too! I was annoyed that they were in big plastic packaging though..."
3,"Not bad, but I liked her other stuff better","This CD is OK, but her earlier stuff is a little more stimulating. This sort of smacks of POP music, and AM radio. But it is highly enjoyable to listen to, just don't expect to much excitment."
4,Super Fun Game,"This game is SO FUN! We originally got the complete game for our family for Christmas but ended up wanting a refill deck so we wouldn't have to shuffle so much. The cards themselves aren't of the best quality; we've had a couple start splitting apart on the edges due to rough shuffling by the kids. We thought about just using regular Uno cards, since they're more readily available at stores where we live, but opted for the actual Uno Attack cards instead. The game is quick to play and the rules are simple, which makes it suitable for kids with short attention spans. The ""attack"" part makes it extra fun. We love this game!"
4,uno family,"This is a game the whole family can enjoy. And uno attack adds the surprise element to the game, you just don't know when you're going to be attacked!!! The kids love it. You can't purchase the replacement cards in the stores that's why I bought two. The cards are not as durable as I would like but for the price, you can go wrong."
2,Wider than 48 inches,"I was expecting this supposedly 48 inch wide light fixture to fit my 55 gallon, 48 inch wide tank perfectly. But have to say I'm disappointed. It's about a half inch too wide and hangs off the side of my tank by 1/2 inch. Is it enough to send back? No. But buyer beware."
2,I not so good read,This author does not write very well or tell a story very well. I find it a great mistake to read this book.
3,"Good, but not as good as its predecessors","I'll be honest -- I buy Nicole Jordan books irregardless because she is one of the best authors in romance today. However, while I've enjoyed her previous books including those in the ""Paradise"" series, I found this particular installment somewhat lacking. I felt more empathy with the hero than the heroine whom I found rather obtuse in the extreme. However, more disappointing was the ""mystery"" at the center of the story. It had no suspense and there was no sense of immmediate danger nor life and death urgency. The supporting characters didn't incite any feelings of compassion or empathy and I found I cared very little for them overall.I hope the next installment will see the return of Ms. Jordan's usually tight, well-written verse and well-rounded characters."
5,Fever Dreams,This is the final book in a series by Nicole Jordan. Once I got used to some of the I Love you but I am not going to tell until you say it first I enjoyed reading them. There was always an antagonist in the story and it was refreshing not to find them repetative.
5,Best Yet,"NJ has written her best novel yet. After Eve is ""sold""into marriage by her parents,Ryder is devestated. When she is widowed six yrs.later he has a second chance. He is aided by her younger sister Claire. When he realizes his drive to possess her is how her husband treated her,he changes tactics. He knows he must seek her happiness and love to to achieve his dream. Wonderful romancs,passionate love scenes,and suspense. This is another excellent read by NJ. My only regret is I finished it too fast."
4,money makeover,This is a wonderful book when you need help in trying to save money. I highly recommend it. It taught me a few things.
3,Good Information,"Good information in the workbook but really the same information as in the Total Money Makeover book, I recommend one or the other but not both books -- and I think Dave would agree!"
4,Excellent but redundant,"This workbook is really a great workbook to put the principals of TMMO into practical use however, the writing in between the exercises is a complete replica of the TMMO book. If you are a Dave Ramsey ""nerd"" you will love it. If you are trying to budget your money, then just get the book and save the money for your Baby Steps!"
2,The Total Money Makeover Workbook,"I would not recommend purchasing this item on the kindle. It is exactly what it says a workbook, but a workbook that you are not able to use. You can't even print the pages, so there is nothing you can really do with it."
5,Lifechanging,"I've read many other books on personal finance and general self help books, but something about Dave Ramsey's philosophy and the way he delivers it caused something to shift in me. After reading Total Money Makeover, I truly wanted and am excited to work hard and even undergo some deprivation to reach financial freedom. We have lived paycheck to paycheck for so many years now, and credit card debt and interest is taking nearly everything we make. My thought patterns were warped; I felt ""entitled"" to buy whatever I wanted on credit because I work hard and deserved it! This book made me realize I'm only hurting myself and my family by driving us deeper and deeper into debt. The author's straightforward, humerous approach cut through my stubborn denial and showed us how to end this cycle of pain and be successful! I read the whole book in one night, set up a spreadsheet and we began taking our first ""baby step"" the very next day.This guy is going to ""save"" many many lives!"
3,Don't buy both book and workbook,It's not worth it to buy both. Just buy one or the other. And you don't even need to but it if you read some editors' reviews or something like that. You can find for free what Dave Ramsey believes is the road to financial freedom.
5,Dave Ramsey Total Money Makeover,I received Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover in record time. The book was packed well and arrived on time. Great condition. Happy with the product. Thanks!!!
3,OK for those who need it,I gave this workbook to my daughter as a gift to help her get her financial house in order. It's a nice workbook for those who need to practice.
5,A LIFE CHANGING BOOK!,"During a visit back to my hometown, my brother kept referring to Dave Ramsey. Who in the world is Dave Ramsey, I asked. My brother showed me the book, The Total Money Makeover, so I got on Amazon.com, ordered the book and workbook, and my life is changing for the good.I'm following the Baby Steps in the book, and shredded my last credit card. I have the emergency fund mentioned in the book, and now I'm ready to live without credit cards. I feel like 60 pounds has been lifted off of me. The book is easy to read, it's entertaining, and full of wisdom. I would recommend this book to everyone who is interested in getting out of debt, and living a life of freedom."
5,Super!,"I bought two of these books to inspire others to try Dave Ramsey's method for achieving financial stability. The books were brand new and in great condition, arrived before promised delivery date. Thank you."
3,Book and workbook to help with finances,I bought this for my son as a Christmas gift with the intention of helping him learn and apply....hopefully he will read it and use the workbook and make a happier New Year for both of us.
4,As expected,"A good place to record specific goals. If I had this book 20 yrs ago, I'd be retired today!"
2,Not worth the purchase if you buy the book,"I bought the Total Money Makeover Workbook along w/ the hardcover book, thinking it would be more 'hands-on'. It wasn't worth the extra cost. A lot of the exercises seemed written for children - fill in the blanks w/ words you read in the passages... really silly. Plus, all the necessary worksheets are in the hardcover book already, so the workbook didn't seem to give me anything new. Don't waste your money on the workbook."
2,Total Money Makeover,"Book is okay. I liked the hardback better for getting right to thde point. I thought this book would be more of a workbook format but found it to have a lot of extra information in it and took a while to get to the action steps. If you haven't done any pshycological introspection around subconscious beliefs and money, this book sort of addresses that. I just thought the hardback was great, I didn't put it down until finished and this so-called workbook was a waste of money."
4,Good for any socio-economic level,"I see some of the other reviewers calling this simplistic. Sometimes life calls for simplistic measures--one foot in front of the other and just take it step by step, even if you are back stepping. I found his advice excellent, simply said and very effective when I finally got with it and followed it. If you are working on yourself, recognize your spending habits and are really looking to make over your financial future--this is great. I like his advice and he is not selling five thousand dollar seminars--no instant millionaire, just sound steps that won't be easy."
3,Don't get if you are buying the book,"This was an excellent ""workbook"" however not necessary at all if you are buying the book. They both contain the same information, but the workbook is a condensed version of the actual book and has more forms. The book is much more in depth, and also contains the forms in the back."
5,Great Book,"The book has all the information as descrbed, as I have not read the book entirely but what I have read is very useful infomation"
5,A must for the American family,"Tired of not having too many bills and not enough paycheck? Frustrated that you are always ""behind"" in bills/payments/savings? Now is the time to take charge of your financial future. Dave Ramsey sets SIMPLE guidelines for your financial success. I must emphasize these guidelines are SIMPLE and easy to follow. I used to live ""paycheck-to-paycheck"". Now, I am on a solid road to financial freedom.This is a phenomenal investment and will pay you dividends for decades to come."
5,cheers for Total Money Makeover,This book was so great that I purchased one for every member of my family. All the information is workable if a person is committed to changing their financial life.
2,Horrible - don't use for Dantes/DSST,"This book was listed by Dantes as a recommended book for their Human/Cultural Geography exam. This book was full of PC claptrap, and factual inaccuracies. 30% of the exam is on climate & topography, and those subjects barely covered in this book. Thankfully, I already knew a lot of the information on the exam so I passed with a high score. I'd suggest Geography for Dummies. Good luck."
1,Yuck,"This is a very cheap book, I'm surprised and dismayed that my professor is using it. It was copyrighted in 2001 and contains weird and outdated information. It is an extremely simple read, and only good for someone opening their own home daycare. It gives a tiny bit of information on every topic from finances to speaking to parents, but is really only appropriate for someone without any higher education, and would be satisfied babysitting children out of their home.I paid 8$ for it and I'll be lucky if I can sell it to someone else for even 5$."
4,Simple Laptop,This laptop is great for me. I have had it for over a year now and it works very well............. most of the time. It was a good value for the price. I am a graduate student and this is what I could afford but it has served me fairly well. I intend to keep it for another 2 years until I graduate.
4,Great for $400! add more RAM & battery and it's even better!,"I agree with the previous reviewers that this laptop a great entry level. The screen is GREAT, integrated wireless works well, and a 60GB hard drive are nice. The two major weaknesses of this product are the tiny amount of RAM (if you try running more than one application at once the thing is unuseable) and the short battery life.I also agree with previous reviewers that if you add another stick of RAM to this, it rips along quite well.I purchased this as an entry level machine and use it for web-access, MS Office, watching DVDs on the go, uploading and sorting through digital photos while away from home.The Celeron processor really struggles if I try any heavy photo editing but I generally try save that stuff for my desktop machine."
5,A Must Have,"As a writer who has long been out of school, I was pleased to discover there is still more to learn about grammar, thanksto Dave Dowling's impressive book. It's an essential read for anyone who wants to communicate effectively and not abuse the English language. It's no secret to co-workers who visit my office that my collection of ""work tools"" has grown--Webster's, Bartletts, Roget's AND Dowling all occupy precious space on my desk! Writing the Right Word is a great reference book that I'd strongly recommend to people of all ages."
5,EXCELLENT RESOURCE,"The book is very useful and to the point. It is an excellentresource for my business correspondence. Since people stilljudge you on your ability to communicate in writing, it willbe very helpful. Will be using it frequently."
2,Wrong opening credits!!....Where is Henry Beckman?,"As any devoted fan of Here Come the Brides would feel, I was anxously waiting for someone to FINALLY release season 2, but with a little trepidation. Since the syndication of ""Brides"" messed up the opening credits of Season 2, I was afraid the DVD release wouldget it wrong also. Well, I was HALF right. The vocal portion of the theme was included like originally shown, but they havestill included the wrong VISUAL version of the credits. As a result, actor Henry Beckman, who was included in the opening creditsfor Season 2 is given NO CREDIT for his role. How undignified this is!!Come on, Shout Factory!! You weren't doing your home work!! Why couldn't you get it right???!!!??"
2,upset,"I am very thankful to have the first season and the second season of Here Come the Brides (my all time favorite show). However, I am very upset that in the second season, Henry Beckman (Clancey) was not given any credit whatsoever. If memory serves me correctly, Henry was sitting beside Joan Blondell in the beginning credits. Now if that is a production error, then I would be willing to buy another second season just to see him get credit for the show. If not, then I would like to know why not."
3,Nice and floral but too light,"Need to use a tablespoon or more of leaves per 8-oz cup, giving a few floral-scented pours but very light, almost ethereal. Prefer something with more body. Water quality and brewing conditions impact flavor significantly, sometimes unexpectedly so."
5,FARAWAY,Probably one of the most exquisite albums I've ever listened to. Jia Ping Fang is certainly one of China's greatest musicians.
4,The Saints Are Staying,"For U2, they definitely know how to make great music as one group, but when they try to make it with another group in a collaboration, it is electrifying. The Saints Are Coming with Green Day is a great collabortaion that Bono and Billy Joe Armstrong really eliver on within each of their voices. The single is the highlight off U2's third greatest hits record U218 singles. I definitely like this track a whole lot, becasue there have been very few really promising duets this past year. I definitely hope that these guys can do something else together like maybe going on tour as one.Song: B 1/2+"
2,The saints came&went,"U2 and Green Day's ""The Saints are Coming"" revived the spirits of New Orleans when the Super Dome was reopened after Hurricane Katrina. The song was for a good cause (Bono is ALWAYS behind good causes!),but,musically,does it work? Does it have a longer shelf life than ""Do they know it's Christmas"" and ""We are the world""?""The Saints are Coming"" opens with a musical shout-out to the House of the Rising Sun. It's supposed to be a lament, but Bono sounds sanctimonious and Green Day's front man sounds whiny. It's forgettable, easy listening rock. The Edge contributes a few electrifying riffs. ""The Saints are Coming""... came and went."
2,Weak.,"This is the weakest song U2 have ever released. It starts off with a quote from The House of the Rising Sun and never really gets going. It just repeats over and over. Mercifully, it's short (like Bono).U2 have run out of ideas. Does anyone still listen to ...Atomic Bomb?Avoid this and the needless U218 compilation.[DW]"
1,sounds like they put it together in 10 minutes,what a terrible excuse for music from generally excellent musicians. It sounds like ESPN called them asked them to put a diddy together and 10 minutes later....presto ...instant mush
5,This is like WHOA,"Two great bands collaborating... U2 and Green Day. I'd never have imagined it, seriously. This song's great: the beginning starts out with Billie Joe singing a few lines from The Animals ""House Of The Rising Sun"" (goes so perfectly with the Skids' lyrics) then Bono does his thing and it's just pure brilliance. Two great voices, one great song, and The Edge's signature guitar sound throughout the whole thing. Get it, it's totally worth your money."
5,Best Single of 2006,"Green Day and U2 cover The Skids and donate to Katrina releif. They brought out the best in each other. Taking on a cover song and melding it with a snippet of ""House Of The Rising Sun"" made this superstar collaboration the best single of the year 2006. Especially since our feds have conveniently forgotten about the victims of Katrina."""
2,Cute. but not great,"I thought there would be some kind of cutesy story in this book or at least catchy quotes, but I found neither. The book is really small and you'll be done with it in about 5 minutes at most. Seriously not worth the $[...] bucks i spent. If you plan on letting someone know that they are about to become a nana then, yeah, I suppose this would be fine. Other than that please save your money and buy something with an imagination."
5,a very sweet gift book,This little book is great to give your mother when you find out you are expecting the first grandchild.
5,A Happy Grandma,"I just purchased this book for my mom. My baby will be her first grandchild. I had it gift wrapped and shipped to her directly, so it was a surprise. She was overcome with so much joy and emotion. I'm glad it made her so happy."
2,Where is my book?,"I ordered this book on December 6th and it is January 9th, I still have yet to receive my book. I sent 3 emails and they responded to 2 of them saying they would order me a new book. So it is as if they never even sent the first one. I asked for my money back for the shipping atleast and they never responded to that email."
4,lifeblood of my work,"I had to throw my $.02 in after the ""not reliable"" review. I have owned one of these for a while and gigged live all over the place with it. Bars, nightclubs, raves, tent parties in the middle of nowhere and this thing takes it all in stride. I bought it because the available control surfaces out there when this came out couldn't touch it. The knobs are responsive and so is the key action (for a midi controller). I wish the faders were a little looser, but that's just for my playing taste. The touchpad has a lot of assignment capabilities and the joystick is just awesome. Def one of the best control surfaces I've ever owned."
4,Change of Times,This cd has a little bit of the genuine Emilio along with some new sounds displaying Emilio's versatility with any type of music. It is apparent that he is trying to keep up with our ever changing times and trying to reach a larger audience.
5,Lee Auto-Prime Rocks! And it's Shell Holders do too!,Lee makes one of the best hand held auto-prime tools available.A complete set of shell holders makes the tool complete!
5,Nashville Season 1,"This is a great new television series. Powers Booth delivers excellent performances as the ""bad guy"" father/ politician. The country music is amazing. Where can I get the soundtrack?"
4,"Great, but alittle too much sex.","I loved the plot of this show, but it is for adults only, way to much sex. I wish they didn't have to put all that in there to sell this because it is such a good story."
4,Liking it so far,I loved Hayden Panettiere in Heroes. Wish that show never ended. It is good to see her take on the bad girl role with different levels to her character that make her more relatable. She is a misguided young star that grew up with a drug using mom and now her drugs is notoriety and seduction. Very hot!!!
3,An example of how tv writing has changed for the better,"The ebb and flow of power, powers many a tv series. If not all. Throw in a little love and you have the plotlines for every story since Shakespeare. Nashville is no exception. While the show burbles along at a merry pace, the hints as to where it may be going are never very far off. There is the country queen, whose grip on her audience is starting to slip, the brash upstart whose morals are of questionable value, the Power Figure, who seeks to Rule All in the shadows, but cannot, since Love and Family are never very far away. All in all, not a bad stew, but as for sudden surprises, unforeseeable characters, stunning twists... maybe they're yet to come, I haven't seen them yet."
4,Nice Change,"I like this show due to the idea that it does not deal with crime, prosecuters, lawyers, fire, police. No disrespect to the latter. This is a nice change to what I see on TV all the time. However again, popular viewing deals with crime, lawyer, fire and police. I am just glad that there is an alternate out there to view.As with all TV shows there is drama, but I just hope this drama doesn't make me crazy with sitting on the edge of my seat stuff. Why do I say that? demographics... I am no spring chicken. So with that, I wish this program well but keep in mind.. you start pulling ridicoluos situations.. I will be done."
3,Like kissing your sister.,"Nice, but not very thrilling. Sort of predictable, but okay.......not terrible....not great. I like Connie Britton [Friday Night Lights], and she is solid in this as well."
3,"Good show, but...","I enjoy watching this show even though I'm not a big fan of country music but as others have said it's interesting to see the behind the scenes of the industry even though it is TV and a lot of it is drama and not so much real life. My problem isn't with the show but when I saw it avaiable to pre-order on DVD and not for BluRay. That just makes no sense to me and I doubt I will but the DVD at all. I can't believe that all new TV shows aren't being released on BluRay disc when they air in HD, just stupid. You pay more for HDTV and yet you can't buy it on the best DVD avaiable."
5,Awesome SHow,"I love this show, I saw the pilot episode just before I was deployed to Afghanistan and I just had to see the remainder of the shows. So I bought a kindle fire and downloaded the entire season. I love the show and recommend it to all of my friends."
4,weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!,"hm, neat music. neat covers. little disappointed cause the video stuff wasn't of them, but mike d is cool."
5,A Truly Great Blues Album,This album showcases a wonderful Austin Band's abilities. The guitar and harmonica explosions are only matched by the Guy's powerful voice. Gil-T provides a rythm that leaves any blues fan shaking at the knees.
3,"Ah, I've seen the damage and the Needle Gun","A buddy of mine in Austin told me this guy is hot right now(Summer 2005) in TX, like the temperature. So I searched out a couple of CDs. This is deffinetly blues, although I'd say this Guy has more in common with Tom Waits than B.B. King.Most of it is interesting music, his lyrics are inciteful and to the point. His guitar work and the occational harp break get notice, but I wanted the melodies to hit me up side the head, the way Muddy Waters hits you, or Jimmy Reed, or Elmore James.That's my kind of blues.If this is indeed white boy blues, and there are many good players out there, I need a hook.That said I enjoyed these songs in particular (in sequence)4) Needle Gun6) Sweet Alice Blues9) This is Hip14) Hometown Boy"
5,I've been taking calcium for quite a while ...,I've been taking calcium for quite a while and really prefer these over the brand I was taking. These were smaller and easier to swallow. They also had more calcium per tablet so I didn't have to take as many. They actually saved me money and I'd definitely recommend these to anyone taking calcium on a daily basis.
1,I would not suggest purchasing this product,Actiontec has long since discontinued this product. I would not suggest purchasing it. Actiontec has many great products like their Mega Plug adapters and DSL Modems. People selling this are probably selling used software.
5,A great EP!,"One of the best hard rock EP's you'll find, by a band that not too many people know about. Four excellent songs, in one tight package. Not as stellar as Tease, but close enough. Check it out!"
2,Nice and Light but the handles broke very soon after purchase,The cooler is really nice but the opening sping mechanish broke and it will not lock close. The top flops from side to side and contents can spill out if tilted.
1,Not for Novices,"If you're new to graphics and Java, this is not a useful book. The first example did not work as displayed in the text and I could not figure out why. Lots of code, very little explanation. I skipped to chapter 3 and discovered the author had switched to applets, but without the required start and stop methods. That example wouldn't run. After a few hours it was clear why the book is not very thick. There is very little explanation. Very frustrating for someone just getting started. Pick another book. (Fortunately this one was cheap.)"
3,good intro for Logic newbies,"the main reason i purchased this book was to evaluate Logic and see if it was enough of a worthwhile investment to switch platforms (I currently use MOTU's Digital Performer). i was so excited to finally receive the book, so imagine my disappointment when i found out I couldn't really use Logic until I received the hardware key. why on earth they decided to do it this way is beyond me. Alas after a 2 1/2 week wait i received the XSKey and started to make use of the book's tutorials. This book got me up and running within Logic 6 in no time. very clearly written and tutorial-based. 4 stars for the book but 1 star off for making me wait 2 1/2 weeks before I could actually use it."
3,Tutorial for Beginners Only,"I am new to Logic, but extremely well-versed in other DAW applications. I was looking for a book to cover hands-on issues not specified in the Logic manuals; what I found instead was a series of tutorials that mimic the information found in Logic. If the Logic Reference Manuals don't address a given topic - for example, dealing with latency issues or how to properly archive a project - don't expect it to be addressed here. You're paying for the same content covered again with better hands-on instruction, which may be of great benefit to beginners of the Digital Audio Workstation paradigm.Bottom line is look elsewhere if you already understand the Reference Manual material."
5,very informative book,The manual is fabulous. Logic Express 7 is quite an undertaking to learn and this book is helping out a lot.
4,good overview of the basics Logic 7,"The book will guide any novice or to be professional into many of the Logic 7 aspects and features. As a Logic Express user I find the usability sufficient although I regret the fact that the last chapter (about Video) is mainly aimed at the PRO - users. Having said this, I like the fact that the author makes clear every time a function is PRO-specific. This is also useful if you consider an upgrade to PRO later on.The book slightly aims at the more `dance' kind of genre and thought I'm more interested in recording pop/rock, it was nowhere getting on my nerves. All basics (as far as I can see!) are in the book and if you have read it, you can make a recording in Logic. For persons like me, who are mainly interested in multi-track recording there might be better books, but I haven't found one yet..."
2,Sad,"I had planned to give this book to my niece after reading it, but I think I'll donate it to the local abuse shelter instead. I didn't enjoy reading it, because it was too upsetting. But it might be good for a child who has had an unhealthy family life to read about others in similarly difficult situations, so see that s/he is not alone, and that things can turn out okay.The messages about abuse and friendship were poignant, but I'm not sure what the author is trying to say about gambling - it's very bad, but you can drink/gamble all night and come out rich. The poker scene on the beach felt a bit like a lesson in how to play, and didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the story.It's sad that the Cambodian people depicted in this story do not consider themselves American, even after many years here. America is a land of people from all over, so it is possible to become completely American without forgetting/losing the heritage/culture of your homeland."
5,SLOTS OF GOOD FUN AND I ACED IT,I love this video game. Its like an instant visit to Vegas without losing any moneySLOTS> POKER 21 and all the rest Highly Recommended . THANK YOU
5,They work,These are well made and have a very good ability to hold things up. As good or better than others tried. Just ordered more.
4,"Good, strong clip","Love these clips! They are colorful, strong and keep important papers on my magnetic board in my office. Priced right too."
3,"Also known as ""The Strange World of Planet X"" (1958)","This is one of the three greatest Forrest Tucker Sci-Fi movies along with ""The Crawling Eye"" (1958) and ""The Abominable Snowman"" (1957).The classic Sci-fi where the mad scientist experiments with nature to everyone's peril and possibly demise. Messing with the earth's magnetic field can have dangerous circumstances and it is up to the military to clean up the mess.Mean while back at the think tank we get treated to what could be a Ménage à trios. That is if no one gets shot.Martin Benson as the alien Smith adds just the right about credence to the film as Mohammed in the film ""Sphinx"" (1981)Yes this is an inexpensive British production but it goes a lot further than most of the genre such as"" Devil Girl from Mars"" (1954)."
3,Bloew average UK sci-fi,"A benevolent humanoid alien comes to earth and meanwhile bugs and insects grow to gigantic proportions in this extremely mild, none too exciting sci-fi from the UK. Doesn't have the intensity of many US giant bug movies and lacks much excitement or interest -- the acting is ok, though. For sci-fi completists only."
2,"I want fun, not a simulation","If I wanted a completely realistic fishing experience, I'd go out fishing. I had owned Sega Bass Fishing for the Dreamcast and that game was loads of fun. You'd throw your lure in, wiggle it around and you'd get a strike. This game gets boring very quickly. It takes forever to reel a fish in. I really don't have much else to say other than that this game is not much fun, so don't waste your time on it."
2,"crappy game play, totally unrealistic!!",The game is really not worth buying Time goes to quick in tournament mode. The size of the fish is really blown up. Also the fish are to easy to catch. Game could be okay for a beginer who just wants to fish and have fun. If you want a good game pick up Bass Landing for the PS1 it comes with it's own fishing reel controller. Bass Landing is an amazing game that is very real and fun to play.
4,"This is a 12""H Stand not 19""","Be careful the product dimensions are mis-leading. This is a 12"" stand which may be too low for your center channel. I had to return mine because I thought this was 19"" in height.Other than that it looked like a nice stand and for $30 --- I doubt it can be beat."
4,Good choice,"Appears to be a solid little stand. Raised the height of my center channel speaker ~12"", putting it just below my projector screen. Also like the fact that it slightly tilts the speaker up towards the listening position. Took about 5 minutes to assemble. Easy to follow instructions (not that you'll need them), and rubber bumpers are a nice touch. It's a keeper."
4,Great Center Stand,"I paid the list price of $755.99 because I wanted something nice and sturdy.I am very happy w/ the purchase and my center channel speaker(Polk CS2) has not fallen once.It's also a sleek looking black, which is very rare.My only complaint is that I could have saved seven hundred dollars by waiting for it to go on sale...so I'm docking it one star."
4,A blueprint for the Church to reach its communities,"This book should be required reading for all large-church pastors and their lay leadership. It presents solid ideas for becoming what Christ told the Church to be - the salt of the earth, the light of the world. Highly recommended."
4,Classic Michael Hui comedy.,"This is another excellent comedy from the king of dead-pan Michael Hui. This time he plays Inspector Chocolate (so called because of his love of Smarties). Alongside him is his trusty sidekick Egg-Tart (Ricky Hui). After bumbling yet another case, Choclate's superior gives him the task of taking his model/policewoman daughter under his wing. Now in charge of missing persons, the threesome are on the hunt of the kidnapped son of a famous tv chef. The great quality of this film is that the storyline is well-drawn and not just an excuse for the comedy. Indeed the encounter with the kidnapper at the end is actually quite touching. Scenes to look out for include Michael Hui's disguise as a small, elderly woman; a truly laugh-out-loud moment. Excellent entertainment."
1,Downloads? I think not.,"This book claims to have dowloads available, and yet, nothing to be found. This book is useless without it's downloads. Their website is down- their publisher's website offers no help, and customer support seems clueless. So if you would like a giant paper weight to adorn your desk, buy this book."
4,nice enough,"shirt is made of VERY thin material,if i had seen this shirt in a store i would not have bought it."
3,Original NewAge songs in Swahili,"Phil Sawyer is the artist behind the Beautiful World cloak. He wrote, arranged and produced all selections. Lyrics are in Swahili for many tracks. The songs are sung in chorus by predominately female voices (includes Miriam Stockley on 10 & 11; Beryl Marsden on most others.) Most would fit into a typical leisurely NewAge lushness category, but none stand out to make this a distinctive album."
3,beautiful world forever,"never knew about this album coming out-i have his 1st album ""in existence"" great album for relaxing-but the art work and pictures in the ""forever"" are nice-i would say if you want his best album get the first one n if u can fine the 2nd album cheep then get it they are both good if u like new age music.."
2,A real dream maker.,"To bad there out, I would dearly love to have a copy of this as well as others by the same artist. First heard it on Dish sat tv on the new age channel and cant get them out of my mind."
4,Kids are Brats,"Wow.. Kids are brats... and Goodwin sure tells us a lot about children in this interesting anthropological look at brats on the playground. The kids she observes clearly have a severe pecking order. Girls bully and belittle boys, boys retaliate, etc. I guess though, it shows you one thing after you read it, people really do never change!This is a great book though if you are interested in the topic of anthropology, fieldwork, or studies involving children and conversational analysis. There is a lot of insight, and its good if you want to do this kind of fieldwork to see how someone else performed it. The interviews and interactions are quite telling."
4,Sevn Wonders III,"We love the first two Seven Wonders but this last one, Treasures of Seven, is not as much fun to play and advance. I would give five stars to #1 and #2 but this one is a four star rating."
3,disapointed,I think that my playing Hidden Wonders 2 before I played Hidden Wonders 1 helped was why I was disapointed.
3,"Live or on CD, ""The Full Monty"" Has its Moments","If you've already seen ""The Full Monty"" on Broadway (after the official opening, I caught the third performance), then you'll fully understand David Yazbek's pungent, serviceable score. In particular, ""Scrap,"" ""It's a Woman's World,"" ""Big Black Man"" and ""Let It Go."" If you haven't, these songs and others, might not satisfy one's taste for show music. They're still fun. But this isn't ""Carousel"" or ""My Fair Lady."" These songs and others fit within the framwork of the three hour show. A few stand alone, but are not the kind of songs one sings full force in the shower, in the car or romping about the kitchen. If you're planning to see the show in New York, grab this album three weeks before the performance. Pop it into your CD player. Read the liner notes. Read the lyrics. And listen to the score over and over. Believe me, it makes all the difference in the world."
4,The Full CD Monty,"This is a great CD. Fun, catchy and insanely funny. There are many standouts on this CD. The standout songs include ""Michael Jordans Ball"" ""Big Ass Rock"" and ""Man"". You can catch Patrick Wilson in the upcoming feature film ""The Phantom of the Opera"" which is a video version of Andrew Lloyd Webbers Classic musical. He is starring as Raoul."
2,Slow and Boring,If you have seen the english movie forget this show.. It is slow .. a lot of talks and just a couple of songs worthy. Go for the movie.. Much Much better
3,Not Sure!!,"Being a soundtrack fanatic, I'm not crazy about this oneA lof of good clean Broadway moments are lost, if you have seen the show you might enjoy this soundtrack, if not, however, it may just leave you naked and empty :)"
4,Great musical,"I had only heard one of the songs before buying this cd, but decided the rest couldn't be to bad. Its great! It is a hilarious score and my roommate has been playing it non stop. I also enjoyed the little cd book inside with a story line and lyrics"
5,Just Great! Lots of Fun!,"In addition to the movie, I've seen The Fully Monty twice; the first time on B'way and more recently the roadshow company in Washington, DC. Both times I -- and the rest of the audience -- have had a blast. This is a fun show, and the cast album conveys this fun! It's not Rodgers and Hammerstein by any means, but you can certainly expect to leave the theater (and the album) whistling several of the tunes. The lyrics are clever and memorable. ""Big Black Man"" is a hoot. ""Michael Jordan's Ball"" is another very clever ditty -- and one that had the audience on it's feet! One song, ""You Walk With Me,"" could become a standard. It's easily the standout number in the score. Although it's used as a theatrical device to establish the relationship between two of the play's characters, its hymn-like quality and the point it makes about any meaningful relationship really take it to another level -- beyond just the context in which it's used in the score; a beautiful song."
4,Fun - Brought back great memories,"Maybe not one of the all-time great scores, but certainly in the top quarter somewhere. It's especially enjoyable after seeing the show & remembering the superb performances."
5,Relive the show over and over again! Use the case as a fan!,"Or so said the man hawking CDs in front of the theater in New York. I reccomend taking his advice and buying this CD.The score of ""The Full Monty"" is more comparable to an older musical score like ""The Pajama Game"" than to an operatic, melodramatic score like that of ""Phantom of the Opera"" (which I also like). When you attend the show, you come out singing the last song.Most of the songs are quite silly: one character sings a love song to his stomach and another extoles the virtues of ""Boot-wearing, beer-drinking, Chevy-driving"" men. The show and its do music retain the charm of the movie with the odd love song and ""Breeze Off the River"" which is sung by a father to his son.This CD is a lot of fun. It deserves more than the five stars I can give it here."
3,An Ok show with some highlights,"The producers of The Full Monty turned the show into a musical and set it in America. David Yazbek's music and lyrics have some shining moments. ""Jeanette's Showbiz Number""s is funny and poigmnant and sung by kathleen Freeman, yes that old lady who played the gossipy characters. She has a verve in this number similar to Irene Ryan's in Pippin. But her character stays with the show longer. Other notable numbers are ""Scrap"", the number the men sing when they are out of work and ""Michael Jordan's Ball"", which is the number in which they learn how to dance. Patrick Wilson has the best voice of the men and his ""Breeze Off the River"" is touching as he tells his son about his failure and yet his love. This is an upbeat musical with a smallish orchestra and solid talent."
5,let it go,"Although this brilliant adaption of the Oscar-nominated film was shut out of the Tonys due to the The Producers sweep, it was honored with a Drama Desk award for David Yazbeck's outstanding score. Yazbeck's music is fresh and new and perfectly fits the show. With a cast that includes such talent as Patrick Wilson, Andre de Shields, John Ellison Conlee, Emily Skinner, and veteran performer Kathleen Freeman, this recording is not to be missed. Wilson, a Carnegie-Mellon alum, stands out in ""Scrap"" and ""Man"". De Shields positively steals the show with ""Big Black Man"", and Skinner shines on the feisty ""Life With Harold"". ""You Rule My World"" is a silly yet touching ballad, and the final number ""Let It Go"" is a simply fabulous ending to a fun, enjoyable show."
4,A decent recording of a good Broadway musical comedy.,"A cast recording of the Broadway production of The Full Monty would never be able to capture everything that made the show distinctive--the complete performances, the jokes, and, well, the ending. But this cast recording does its best--it captures the songs in a very listenable and entertaining form, and if the songs aren't always what you might hear in the theater, they still come across well here. If you enjoyed the show on Broadway, you will probably appreciate the recording. If you haven't seen the show live, it may be harder, though the recording will tide you over nicely until you can actually see the show, which you should, and at your earliest opportunity."
5,A great soundtrack for a great show!!!,"This is a great show and the music makes it! There are funny songs and beautiful ballads. If you haven't seen the show on Broadway, see it, if you haven't heard the album, listen to it!!!!"
4,"Seen it, heard it, enjoyed it!","I saw the show on Broadway in November, and it was a lot of fun! The album captures the offbeat and irreverent spirit of the show, and in listening to the CD I picked up some jokes I hadn't caught the first time through. It's true that if you hear the album without seeing the show, some of the songs won't make sense, but enjoy them for what they are, and if you're looking for an entertaining and light-hearted Broadway experience, this is the show to see!"
4,Parasol,"I used these for my wedding and they were nice. The wedding party took pictures with them.I later used them at Disneyland which saved me from getting torched by the sun. It's lightweight so it's nice to carry around, but it got distroyed on the log ride :("
1,Wandering nothing.,Not any great art here. The shameless hype in the advertising notes won't make the films watchable. Like an elementary school kid's first attempt with a camera. Precious money is better spent elsewhere.
5,Super Salsa La differente,Whew! Just listened to this CD and it is hot. Every player is a pro and the voice of Faith has that star quality ring. Why this isn't an Amazon pick is beyond me. The whole CD is totally consistent all the way through with no junk filler like many others I have heard.
3,Hoyles name is being put to shame in Encores interpretation of Hoyle Slots....,"This title isn't quite up to par with some of the other slot games that are out there. It has many themes and varieties but no matter how you look at it they all play the same. Encore did not even put any work into the graphics of this game. The new slots , they look so rushed and unpolished and the payouts have bugs too, which Encore officially released a patch for to correct these bugs and a few other quirks along the way.Lets put it this way. If I were the owner of Hoyle Gaming, and this was a game Encore wanted to release.... I would forbid the sale of it and tell them to polish it up more before releasing it...... at least bring the game up to the same high quality standards Sierra had when they were programming these games...."
1,Biggest DUD in the history of man!,"1,500 slots? more like 5 poorly made slots repeated 300 times each. Talk about a disappointment, this takes the cake. You'll be happier flushing your money down the toilet than wasting it on this product."
4,"Cool,Techno.,& Still So Very DE-VO!!!","O.K.,Look These Guys Are The Fathers New Wave/Techno,In The Mid To Late 70s These Spud Boys From Akron Ohio Opened A Door Inwitch Many Bands & Much Music Has,And Is Still Utilized Today. DEVO&Their Music Are Alot Like Scotch!? They are Both An aquired Taste...Now From what I Just Sampeled I Think It Was Worth My Time & I Hope Others To Just Peek-a-Boo & Listen To Yet Another De-voultionary release!!!"
5,Tight and comfortable,"The moderate support pantyhose is warm to wear in nowadays' weather, feels tight and comfortable at the same time.Will recommend this to family and friends!"
1,Microsoft is dishonest,Microsoft is dishonest in its description: The wired remote only works with the Zune 30GB. It does not work with the newer Zune 80 or 4 or 8. Microsoft is not clear explaining about general compatibility.
2,Ok but not a delight,"The case is good and sturdy but bulky, not so great for your briefcase on a plane. The interior is well designed, plenty of space for Zune stuff. The headset is ok, not anything exceptional, just a backup I guess. The power converter did not work at first but now works fine. The headset splitter does not work at all, but applications for this thing are so limited I won't miss it. All in all, not worth returning but not worth recommending."
1,No 80 GB Zune Compatibility,I bought this at Radio Shack on Sale. Amazingly I tried it out in the store. Didn't work. They opened a second one. Didn't work.No 80 GB Compatibility. Not mentioned on packaging. How difficult would it be to mark existing stock with a 1 cent sticker that says 'works with 30GB Zune only'.
4,Wonderful for the Price,"Was shipped well, and fast. The product was shipped with parts outside the protective case (Part of the Zune Travel Pack) but seems to be all working and in good shape. E-mail support was good. I'd buy from them again."
4,good,would have given it a 5 but the headphone splitter does not work. wanted the package for the carring case which is everything i expected it to be
3,Parts of it are good,"WE got the pack for my son primarily for the a/c adapter but was looking forward to using the dual headphone jack. We can get it to work, but the rest is okay."
5,carrying case and extras,works great for zune and has good storage space for headphones and what not and the extra chords and headphones were great
1,Only Works with Zune 30GB,Amazon needs to provide this information in its description: The wired remote only works with the Zune 30GB. It does not work with the newer Zune 80 or 4 or 8. Even Microsoft is a bit obscure about compatibility. You can find the information in Microsoft's forums.
3,Paying for convenience,"The headphones are good, but not great. The charger is just a USB charger with the Zune logo on it. The extra cable is only there so you have something to plug into the USB charger, and the headphone splitter/remote is really only useful if you're planning to share your traveling Zune experience with a 2nd person. And if this is a Travel Pack, why is there no car charger included?The real draw of this kit is how all of these accessories work along with the case. The case is compartmentalized, so all Zune-branded products fit snugly into predefined niches which keeps everything from rattling around. You can purchase non-branded versions of all these accessories for a lot less money, but if you're really hung up on organization, this is probably the way you want to go."
5,Great Buy,"The headphones work much better for my ears than the ones that came with the Zune. I'm glad to have a wall charger so I don't have to use my laptop to charge it. And I think the travel case is great--although I won't carry my Zune in it while traveling (I'll be listening to it!). I will use it to carry the accessories and it will also hold the chargers for my cell phone, PDA, etc., as well. All in all, a very worthwhile purchase."
3,Nice but no cigar,"I loved the case itself, but personally I do not like earbud style headphones. I have collapsable over the ear style in a case that wold not fit inside the Zune case. Also, I didn't think I would use the remote much. All in all this was a good purchase if you could use all the items, but for me, I did better buying a padded camera case for $20."
3,Not worth the price tag,"The travel pack includs a good set of accessories and a case big enough to fit them in, but there are a few problems:1. a car charger/adaptor is curiously missing.2. the headphone is nice, but there are better alternatives out there for cheap.3. case really is too big to be of practical use, especially when travelling.4. finally, The travel pack costs as much as a 30GB zune these days, and for what is included, I think i am better off with a second zune30."
2,Not worth the cost,"I bought the travel pack hoping mostly for better headphones and secondarily for a good travel case, but neither lived up to my expectations, and I don't think my expectations were that high. The headphones have what appears to be a smart design, using interchangeable rubber cups to try and fit all ear sizes. However, what I found was that none of them were comfortable to wear on a two hour flight and the sound quality was no better than the stock ear buds. The travel case, while sturdy, has no handle or strap of any kind and I found that to be problematic while getting through airports and even on an airplane. The A/C adaptor is redundant with other accessories and should be sold separately."
4,In This Case...,I really like this travel kit for the most part. I am currently in Iraq and this does a great job of keeping everything safe and in one place. It's a well designed and built set-up. The power adapter is good because you can just plug the sync cable in to it instead of having more cables to worry about. The only reason I won't rate this a 5 is because of the horrible ear buds. The holder for them is nice and all but the earbuds themselves won't stay in my ears and didn't seem to put out that well.
4,great but...,The travle pack should really include the FM tuner for the car. i love the headphones they are very comfy.
2,too expensive and my headphones broke in 2 weeks,"I am a person who actually uses these items, alot. After 2 weeks of using these headphones, the right earpiece quit playing. And I hear MS is not suppporting anything that stops operating. Also, it is too expensive. I am enjoying the Zune, but all the accessories should be a little more accessible."
3,can't use much of the product,"I purchased this for my son to use with his Zume( the new edition) and the earphones won't work and something else broke. (Mom doesn't know the technical aspects of these things!) When we tried after Christmas to return the product to the manufacturer, we were informed that it was too late. So it's still sitting here in the box and I don't know what to do with it since my son left for college. Better find out exactly which products this item works for before you purchase one."
1,Zune Review,"The advertising of this product made me believe that this was a genuine travel pack. In fact, this product did not have any adapter to allow you to take your Zune in the car with you. That was my main goal was to obtain an adapter so that my daughter could take her Zune with her on trips. It was her 16th birthday present and I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in what this pack contained."
2,i sent it back..,"I sent it back because, after i was told they had the zune in stock they did't have it...I will not be buying from you again..Marilyn Hicks"
5,A must have for the zune!!!,"Anyone who has the zune will get its full potental with the travel pack. The headphones that come with the zune are very uncomfortable and don't stay in my ear. The premium headphones are perfect: their comfortable, loud, and with great quality sound. The remote helps you control the zune without taking the zune out in public that helps especially if you live in a bad part of town. The ac charger charges quicker than charging your zune through your computer. The gear bag is rugged and holds everything and more. Since I got the travel pack, I can't go anywhere without any of the accessories. I love it!!!"
3,Worth the money after all...,"I didn't do my complete research on the actual Zune item itself, and was under the impression that it came with nothing but the bare unit itself. So I went ahead and ordered the travel kit. Unlike the horrible, waste of money car kit, the travel kit is a pretty good deal. Most of the items come in handy, but I already had a set of ear buds and pc usb cable. The buds that come with the kit are a bit nicer and have alternate covers. The remote could come in handy, but the case is the best part. Very handy indeed. It has cargo netting on one side, and straps on the other to hold your Zune in place. The case is pretty rugged overall, and could save your bacon in certain situations."
1,Not what is displayed,"The picture displayed for this item is not correct, this are the standard rubber latex gloves. Not the vinyl glove displayed."
5,I love this machine!!!!,"I bought this machine on recomendation from a friend who knows i spend alot on going out for latte's and such. I had never tasted one of the there drinks before, but his recomendation included the words ""Its the best coffee I ever had that wasn't in Italy"" So I though how bad could it be. I was right to pull the trigger, it is delicious, and the online only purchasing of the pods was a lot less hassel than I thought, Considering Chicago's gas prices and Starbucks prices it was a sound investment.... And it taste way better to me."
3,Basic and conversational are the same CDs,"I really like the Pimsleur CDs, but do NOT buy both the Basic AND Conversational, as Amazon suggests. Basic consists of 5 CDs, and Conversational has the same 5, plus three additional. My recommendation is that you just buy the conversational and call it a day. My only other complaint is that I wish there were more than just the 8 CDs. To get a decent amount of Turkish, it looks like you need to spend >$200 for the full set. There needs to be more intermediately priced options."
4,Learning turkish,"These 5 CDs included in the package give the learners a good start. The materials are pretty easy to follow. There are many repeats in the CDs to allow the learners to practice. The learning experience has been pretty good. However, I feel that the speakers in the CDs speak too fast. They should also repeat at least once and break down the sentences into the smaller parts for students to catch up. Another improvement needed is that the speaking material is not printed. The students can only rely on their memory and CDs but nothing to visualize. There are also no number counting in the CDs - maybe it is in the advanced ones. Anyway, the CDs give good tutorial to the first time Turkish learners."
2,"A rip-off, buy the Conversational Turkish CDs",This set costs considerably more than the Conversational Turkish CDs through Pimsleur (about $220 vs. $35) and yet the first eight CDs are exactly the same. One has to decide whether you are willing to pay $35 for the firs eight and then $185 for the second eight. I'd recommend just ordering the basic conversational set and waiting for something better to come out or using Rosetta Stone.
2,Misinformed reviewers,"This is one of the few cds in my collection I had to get rid of. I know Mr. Popov is well loved and liked in Russia, and is a respected Puchner bassoon artist, but my goodness this cd is generally wretched. Another lackluster Chandos release of music to accompany some of the boring wind cds in their catalogue (I sight the Athena ensemble and Geoghegan's new French music for bassoon cd, not to mention the ok-decent Janet Hilton clarinet cd). Popov's vibrato is horrendous and down right offensive. He sounds like a person attempting to play under water, the tone and pitch are garbled behind his pulsating oscillations of sound that never change or add to the character of what he plays. There's far better recordings of this repertoire out there. Check out Thunemann, Dag Jensen, Danny Bond, Turkovic. The orchestra is pretty good actually."
3,A intense fotball book.,"This book was pretty confusing in the first part of the chapter.Soon,though, it got clearer when he stated telling how he got this problem.Thourgh out the rest of the book the main character is very informative.The book is very exciting if you like football.The main character does go through some hard times with hi dad's problem but this gives the book a plot.I think the kid in the book overeacts in the book to much.I think he just needs to relax.He gets to worked up over nothing.I would have to say this book is like other Matt Christopher books.There is always a problem for the character in a sports action.But I think this book was a little more confusing and a little less interesting.The other character are just helping the problem or solving it for him.These would be his friends and family.I would recommend this book to people who like football or any sports books."
4,"Uneven, but beautiful","The more I listened to this album, the more I liked it. I say it's uneven because while some of the songs, like ""Only Talking Sense"", ""Last Day in June"", and ""Where is My Soul"" are hauntingly beautiful, others on the album are much rougher. The tone of the album changes from song to song - but that's kind of a good thing - it's good when not every song on an album sounds identical.Overall, I would say that this album was definitely worth buying, more so if you are a big Neil/Tim Finn fan, like I am."
4,Good if lightweight. Some great moments,"This is indeed no Crowded House nor even Split Enz album but it's very pleasant to listen to, and some of the songs have some great melodies. 'Only Talking Sense' is a good example: melodic, slightly off-beat, hinting at a darker side but not really exploring it. It's a bit like a good Chinese meal: much more interesting than most anything else but later on you don't feel satisfied. I wonder if the inevitable multi-tracking when two people do everything has lost some of the cohesiveness of a performance sound. Worth having and very enjoyable, but not quite great."
5,Lovely pieces,"To my amateur ear, these pieces sound a bit like the symphonies of Schumann. In other words, they are mellifluous, engaging, and loveble. Give them a few listenings, and you'll be rewarded. The performances by the Detroit Symphony are lively and crisp. This is my kind of music."
4,The whole showoff of all the Hong Kong stars,"A movie that was made for charity. A movie that just took 3 days for writing the scripts and shooting. A movie that the entire celebrities in the Hong Kong showbiz took part. What do you ask for more? True, these are the most attractive part of this movie. In terms of storyline, I personally think it reflected the people in the society nowadays(or at least in the 1990s). Everyone loves moeny and once they got rich, they still ask for more. At the end, they found out the best thing is not money, but the time you spend with your family and the friendship in which money could not buy. Besides just watching the movies, you also get the chance to see all (or at least most) of the celebrities in Hong Kong. They are all the most famous people back then. If you are familiar with the artists in Hong Kong, try to find out how many of them are still here. You can also see Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun-Fat in this movie, too."
3,"Amazing stuff, in that special jazz fusiony way","A used record store acquaintance sidled over and said I saw Hendrix live: they're better. Went to go see them. Loved the show and like the album.The Screaming Headless Torsos debut (the worst band name ever? they're in the running) is a heck of a lot of fun. Modal guitar twinkies, noodling vocal scat, deep funk vibes with crushing rock riffage coming in sideways. All with extra bongos.It's the tweedle-tweedle vocal trick that slaps me out of things. It's one great trick, don't get me wrong, but it is the same trick. Over and over. The guitar heroics can also be fatiguing. Perhaps this is the definition of a jazz fusion album: amazing skills but ultimately frustrating."
3,"Good Reference, Difficult to Learn From","This book covers all of the important points in solving numerical partial differential equations numerically and is a pretty good reference if you are already familiar with the material. The organization, index, and formatting of the text make it difficult to learn from, so I would not recommend either teaching from it or learning from it."
1,not recommended,"The cordless/answering/fax worked fine for a few months, but buttons started sticking. Panasonic service dealers told me it would cost more to fix the handset buttons, than to buy a new one. I am sure I won't buy another Panasonic phone again."
5,Well...,"It's a wonderful album to be certain, one with a very surreal ambiance feeling to it. Has my highest recommendations.But one problem: it isn't by a group or person going by Strange Cargo.It's by William Orbit, and it's named StrangeCargoHinterland, the fourth in a series of Strange Cargo albums. I made mistake as well while trying to name the digital files I ripped for my MP3 player, but it is definitely by William Orbit, under that album name I mentioned."
4,This will grow and groove on you!,"Good tracks to paint, dance, or drive by. It gets better each time you listen to it."
3,"A great listen, but not essential","This is a good disc (3 1/2 stars). I've had it on everyday since purchasing it some days ago; still, I can feel it frequently reaching, but not always grasping. I don't regret purchasing it and I do enjoy it, but I would have liked Orbit to have gone a little further. If you have the money to spare and are into Strange Cargo, buy it; however, if you are on a tight music budget, spend your time looking for something with a little more breadth and originality."
3,Small,I have very small hands so I orderd a size small. It is very small and tight and the velco kind of rubs on your skin.I still wear it during exercising but it takes a couple of minutes until properly adjusted so it doesnt bother me.
4,Very good,"This is a very good wrist brace. The only issue is that the thin neoprene that goes around your thumb can start hurting your hand if you wear it for extended period of athletic activity. But it's very well made, no problems. Mine was not blue, as shown in the picture, it is black, which is good."
5,Just what I was looking for...,The combs are much prettier than anything I've seen at the store and the shipping was super fast. I also love the barette and thank you for the gift. Such a pleasure to order from this company.
1,truly awful,"This movie is pure crap, it has nothing going for it, it's not even very good as a skin flick --- the dialogue is truly awful, the sex scenes are few and far between, and there is nothing good about it. Not one redeeming quality. This is the worst kind of b-movie. If I could give it a negative rating, I would."
4,Good nudity,"There's an ample amount of nudity and a few sexual scenes. Not too bad, but there could have been a couple more scenes..."
4,good b-movie.,"The movie was a good mystery as well as good acting. And it was genius to have the victim play a diva in which nobody could stand and have the main character as well as the main suspect play a emotionally abused husband. Another good thing about the movie is the love scenes. Don't get me wrong, I love the female body as well as the next man, but where movies use it to attract men watchers, the film used it as a spark to attract the main character interest in the mistress. What i do not like about the movie is that the fighting scenes are slow and predictable. This movie was not made in the eighties, but the fighting scenes and the slow sound effects are used in this case."
1,Beautiful movie - BAD DVD transfer,"The movie is worth the viewing, but the video transfer is one of the worst I have ever seen on DVD. Worse looking than an old VHS tape. Too bad."
3,Passions for money and love,I just finished viewing the entire movie and was totally frustated by the very blurry end credits. I couldn't complete an accurate catalog of the Cast of Characters and filmmakers from that which was provided. I can't even provide any updates to iMDB to update their database. The movie itself to me was that of a soap opera with required love and fight scenes to try and get viewers. I can't rate it any more than 3 stars.Betrayed by Passion
1,One GREAT song,"Overall this CD is not nearly as well done as some of the other Vineyard CDs. However, the title song, ""Jesus I Believe You"" is worth the purchase price."
4,Native American Barbie,It was a gift and made one little girl very excited and happy. She is a Native american girl herself.
1,Don't buy it unless you want a mess,"A five pound bag of flour barely fits in the container and when it does you can't close the lid. After you have used some, you can close the lid, but there is not enough room to dip a 1 cup measuring cup into the bag without spilling flour all over. Forget leveling the flour off into the bag of flour. I would much rather just use the bag without the plastic container, it would be much less messy."
4,"RED DWARF - WAY COOL, OF COURSE","One of the tighter seasons - cast really revelling in their individual roles, and possibly the second funniest (after Season 5)."
2,Weird side slits,"Not sure why they did this, but there are side slits where the piping is at the hips that are open to whatever you wear underneath. Doesn't this defeat the purpose of waterproofing? Probably done for ventilation, but not viable for my main purpose, which was riding my bike in rain. (Also, the small had very small waist and puffy everywhere else.) Fabric is more substantial than most of the waterproof stuff out there, which could be good or bad...."
4,Not bad!,"These pants are indeed waterproof, but I must say they do run a little long lengthwise. The pipes are also wide which I think is fine if you're wearing pants underneath, but I didn't do that so they looked a bit baggy. Other than that, the product works."
2,Weird feel and way too hot,"These pants have a strange ""made in china"" feel that becomes uncomfortable after long, and they do not get much air in them at all, you'll start sweating quickly in these pants. Outside of that, they look and fit well, especially if you have a slim frame and they have nice reflective linings on the pockets and down the legs for late night runners."
4,Excellent swing analysis,"This collection contains some terrific footage of Hogan at various times in his career and some excellent analysis of his swing by Jim McLean. The collection is far from ""complete,"" however. I was disappointed that more footage of interviews with Hogan was not included in the piece on Hogan's life and career. It would also have been nice to see video of Hogan's own attempts to teach important points of the swing. Some of this footage has appeared on YouTube: specifically, the footage of an elegant Hogan talking about the importance of the lower body in the golf swing; the footage from the Ed Sullivan show when Hogan demonstrated his training exercise; and the private footage from Florida when Hogan makes an interesting point about his right-hand grip; but it would have been great to see that footage collected here as well."
3,Cute for your cubicle. Not that much fun for kids?,"This was the first Mr. Potato Head that I've ever had. I bought it for my 1.5 year old.I should have saved this for my cubicle. It looks really cute and it'd be something fun to display.But I was a bit disappointed for a younger kid's toy, maybe since I never had one. The parts that you plug into the Potato Head body are made of a slightly bendable PVC, so they are fairly difficult to plug in. I'm not even sure when my kid reaches the recommended 2+ age he would be able to plug the parts completely in himself.For those of you admiring the little truck: it doesn't roll. That was a pretty big letdown for me. Also, the chest piece does not form the front of the truck. The truck is a single piece that doesn't connect to anything. It's entirely for show."
4,more for looks,"I got this for someone who was a major star wars fan, and they loved it, it's more for aesthetic purposes, but something nice to play around with once in a while."
5,Optimus toy,"My son-in-law collects these super hero Mr. Potato Head figures and he was thrilled with it. I buy them when I find them first. I know my grandson will love the collection, too. There was a war over it the other day when a two-year-old son of his cousin came to visit and wanted to play with it. It was on display. My grandson wouldn't have anything to do with that. He is two and still a bit possessive. It all ended with tears. I know it will be enjoyed."
4,Opti-mash Prime,"What a deal! This awesome product was new in the box, at a great price, and shipped right to my house in time for Christmas."
4,Fun Gift,"After seeing ""Transformers"", my boyfriend loved it so much I started looking for Transformer-themed gifts for his birthday...he absolutely loved the potato head. It's really cute, any fun-loving Transformers fan would like it!"
5,Best Ginger Preserves Ever,Found these locally in Chicago about 6 months ago. Amazon's price is high but these are definitely the best I have ever tried. My wife and I cook with it and just spread it on toast or crackers. The white jar is also distinctive.
5,"Oh, My! This Stuff Is Delicious!","My nearby Fresh and Easy Market (an English company) has a variety of English fruit spreads and I'm enjoying trying them out. One of the latest is James Keiller & Son Dundee Ginger Preserve. Oh, my! This stuff is just delicious. I've always liked ginger, but as a spread it's just fantastic! What a nice flavor for my breakfast toast! I can hardly wait to try this out on other folks. Or I could give a jar here and there as gifts. I'm sure they'd be appreciated.Gary Peterson"
2,Broken and not what picture showed,Second time I have reported this. One jar broken and orderNot what pictured. Jam same but jar different. I know my gingerThis not same.
5,Great book on Grieving with God's help,"Great delivery , done in a quick manner. Book is very helpful for Christians going Through Grief. I am already doing some of the ideas presented in this book."
5,You have to have a weird sense of humor ---,"And that's a good thing! Vapor is a great novel. From the beginning to the end, I was entranced with the author's weird and twisted sense of humor, and I loved the characters. You just know that there's so much more going on, and when it's time, you'll learn what you need to know.I've read some of the other reviews posted here saying that the book was terrible (throwing it across the room? SHAME!), and I think that might be true for some people. Then there's the rest of us that can appreciate strange plot twists and characters that think things we would ""never"" think (ha, yeah, right).So, I will leave my review at that. I laughed, I cried, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out the anagram at the end of the book (this is a theme that runs through the story).Excellent read! If you liked Nude Men, then you must read Vapor!"
1,don't waste your money,"Please do not buy this book, it was the worst book I have ever read (and I went through a bizarre Danielle Steele stage). I honestly tossed it across the room when I was done with it. I want a apology letter from whoever recommended it so highly on this site. It is slow, bizarre (not in a good way-- just weird), and a poorly written."
4,Amanda is back!,"What a wait this was from Nude Men. Yes, the undeniable humour and plot twists are still very apparent. The voice that comes through in Amanda's writing makes her books addictive once you have read them and the fact that it may be another 7 or 8 years until the next one. Other reviewers have described the storyline but I would suggest not to find out too much about the book before reading it. But it is so difficult to really judge how good this book stands on its own without comparison to Nude Men. I would suggest to any readers to read Vapour first and then read 'Nude Men'. If anyone does that, please let me know what your impressions are. I am going to wait a week or two and then re-read it. The bottom line is that it is still an excellent book and it is highly recommended."
3,Interesting-but no Nude Men,"Like Nude Men the characters and plot are real while the author tries to tell you otherwise. Emotions, decisions, and excuses are real without seeming so. But unlike Nude Men it doesn't carry, and the post-modern feel tends instead toward the Weekly World News. Read Nude Men, the author is a genius,(and must be very interesting) yet in Vapor this might not be quite so apparent."
2,Bad view,The difference between this Millenium Celebration CD and the one Disney produced is that at least when you went to purchace the Disney one you could see the music that is on it to know you are getting the right item. This CD does not give that option and I wish it did.
5,Deep Deep Dub and tight beats,"This is William Orbit's best album. Unlike all of his other material, this album maintains a cheese factor of absolute zero. He's a gifted producer who's really come into his own it seems. Not over-produced, just lush ambience, lots of bass, and enough dynamics to carry you through nicely. Gumbo Ya Ya and Shine On Me (Andromeda Mix) are unbelievable. Turn up loud for this album. Dreamy, energetic, deep. Dub in the dance nineties"
5,Mesmerizing,"Used to listen to this CD over and over sitting at my desk at work. I still play this CD now and then and it's become so embedded in me. These tracks seem to carry a life force with each listen. Catchy rhythms, mixing chords, bass and amazing synthesizer creations, all overlapped into a memorable trip that seems to stick in your head forever. William Orbit did a fine, fine job on this!"
2,orbit over-produces; drowns out laurie meyers vocals,"william orbit, grossly overproduces on Towards the unknown region, in the process drowns out laurie meyers captivating vocals( which was the main attraction on their first 2 albums.) also not enough driving guitars and beats, to spacey. maybe 1 or 2 songs vaguely resemble past albums"
2,A bit of a Stinker,"I have self-learned Photoshop, Illustrator, QuarkXpress and InDesign well enough to earn a living doing pre-press work.I learned iMovie reading one of the ""Missing Manual"" books and chose Weynand's book to help me advance to Final Cut Express. Well, it didn't do the trick for me.One review said, ""The trees are clear in her manual but the forest is nowhere in sight."" Frankly, I didn't know what that meant - but after wasting my ""hard earned"" on this book, it's crystal clear.This is the problem with buying books via the internet. Had I looked at this book at a book store I would have put it back on the shelf!I"
2,Bent upon first use.,Bent upon first use. Great length. Smooth finish. Nice over the rod hanging feature. Bummer about the instant bending.
1,Don' bother,"While the length is great on this showhorn, and the metal is quality, the design is WORTHLESS. The part that goes behind your heel into the show is FLAT. Now, maybe there are some people whose feet are square on the heel, but mine are round, and my shoes are round at the heel, and this product is simply painful, and would destroy your shoes if you could suffer through the pain and actually used it regularly. Keep looking!"
5,Performs as advertised and even more,"I wear short ugg boots and with my hip arthritis it is difficult to me to bend over to pull them up. I chose this shoe horn as I wanted something sturdy that wouldn't break. The other important thing I was looking for is an end I could hook into the loop on the back of my uggs to pull them up, rather than using it as a conventional shoe horn. Most shoe horns wouldn't work this way. This one does as long as you put the more hooked end in the loop before putting on the ugg. Then I pull on the shoe horn end and they go on without problem. This is exactly what I was looking for."
5,Long-handled shoehorn,"Very nice product! The length is good for my 6' height. The shoehorn is steel, a reason I bought it. As I am getting less flexibility in my legs, its firmness and length make a very great help in getting on shoes and short boots. The steel doesn't bend; a help with some boots. I would definitely buy it again, and I wish I had purchased it ages ago! (Had a shoe salesman had one, he could have maybe sold me a pair of boots once.)"
3,Unchain Your Mind,"I bought this CD for my mom for Mother's day. It is so cute to watch her bounce up and down behind the wheel of the car as she listen's to ""Unchain your mind"". She does the cutest little bounce dance around the house...you'd have to see it to understand...but I think it's so cool that this one song makes my mom stop what she's doind, have no worries, and just dance her heart out."
5,A real comfort for those who have been there...,"I was diagnosed with diabetes at age 12. This book provided immeasurable comfort and help for me. It gave me a perspective that no doctor could provide. I understood that it was OK to feel weird around your friends at first, and it was great having someone to identify with on the subjects of returning to school, parental overprotectivity, etc. A must for those who have or know someone who has diabetes, and a very good, honest, and entertaining source of facts for those who are just interested in information about the disease. A really great read!"
5,X Japan is the best!,"Great production and great music. Voiceless Scream is hauntingly beautiful... Plus, this is one of the rare CDs by X Japan that you can still purchase as ""new"" and ""official""."
1,"Thin on substance, overpriced.","I felt this book was very overpriced for what is basically a large format promotional pamphlet for the IDPA. It is a very basic book aimed solely at the IDPA newbie and won't be of any use to the shooter who has been through at least a handful of matches and is on the IDPA email list.It had no information on practice drills or stances. Any technique information was very skimpy.Since it's a 2004 book, it has no information on the 2005 rules changes and the resulting brouhaha.There are better competition shooting technique books out there."
3,Good But Way Too Pricey!!,"This is a very well written, informative and illustrated book by a man who has 'been there - done that'.However it is far too expensive for its content and size. A much more reasonable price would be about half of the current price.It is an enjoyable book for anyone interested in IDPA but I would not recommend it unless you don't mind overspending for a product."
4,Excellent but very short,"Anyone interested in IDPA, this is a must buy. I wish is was more indepth and longer. However, for casual interest might want to skip it. It is too short."
4,Brief Comments on Libertarian Party at Sea on Land,"I was much impressed with the aptly titled book ""Libertarian Party at Sea on Land"" by Harold Kyriazi. It is surely controversial, but presents the Georgist view with care and clarity. The evaluations of other writers on the subject described in later pages is quite original and eminently fair. If the author's purpose was to make the reader re-think the issues, it has surely been achieved."
2,not recommended,"I would not recommend this book as a good source to learn more about ADD or ADHD. Although it was somewhat interesting to read about the life experiences of others, it really did not offer useful coping skills. I also felt like it was geared more towards adults who had not recognized their problems until much later in life and the havoc undiagnosed ADD can cause in your life. Some of the other books I have read also give a few examples which are helpful in recognizing and understanding your child and their problems, but they also offer good coping skills for you and for your child."
2,Recognizing but not Coping with ADD,"From the other reviews on the Amazon site, I can see I am in the minority. I did not find this book helpful at all. The title professes ""Recognizing and Coping..."" I gave this review two stars because it gave A LOT of recognizing...but not much coping. I know my husband and son have ADD. We do not believe in medication and therapy through our HMO has been a waste of time. The book had close to 300 pages of story after story and I came away with two tips...routine and lists. I wish that I would have just checked it out at the local library instead of wasting my money. If you want stories about other people with ADD then this book is for you. If you are already at the point that you know you have to deal with ADD...look elsewhere."
5,An must read for anyone with ADD,"I am a 23 year old college who has ADD and this is one of the best books I have ever read. I found out I had ADD 2 years ago, and then found that most people knew very little about it. Even my doctor had little knowledge of what it is really like to live with this disorder every day. The author himself has ADD, and can accurately relate what it is like.I found this book to be insightful, funny, and very informative. I was so absorbed in this book, I found myself reading 100+ pages in one sitting. When I was done reading, I was dismayed that there was no more to read.Thanks to this book, I now have a better grasp on my disorder, and know about it than my doctor."
5,"Well written, informative book on ADD","This book was recommended to me by a doctor. It has lots of real life stories about people with various types of ADD. As I suspect my son and I may have some symptoms of ADD, this book has been extremely helpful. I highly recommend it!"
5,Useful book for spouse of ADD adult,This is a very informative book which focuses on case studies of clients the author has seen in his practise. As the spouse of someone with ADD it was helpful to see others with similar traits.
4,Driven to Distraction,"Really helped put into words what I saw in my son. Also helped me understand how to cope with him, and that chances are....he got his ADD from me. Would highly recommend it to any parent trying to figure out whether your child needs additional treatment or if that's ""just the way he is."""
5,Good advice for the non-technically trained,I've had a few clients in my business coaching practice with ADD; people who couldn't stay focused from their desks to their file cabinets. This book really helped me with some good practical advice on how to more effectively deal with people with ADD. It also has a good section on the questions to ask to know whether someone should be professionally tested for ADD.
2,Tearjerker,"If you are looking for an emotional catharsis about ADD/ADHD, this is the book for you. Almost 200 pages of heartbreaking case studies and personal accounts... it really follows through on the first promise of the title: RECOGNIZING ADD from childhood through adulthood.I would say that the focus of this book is more on getting that ""A-HA"" moment for adults who grew up with ADD and didn't know it. That's my opinion; I don't know whether it was the goal of the book, but that is the sense I got from reading it.The beneficial (for non-Attention-Deficit-Disordered and/or non-catharsis-needing people) bit of the book begins around Chapter 7, which discusses the steps to diagnosis (including diagnostic criteria for children and adults from the DSM-III-R, which I am pretty sure has been replaced by the DSM-IV.) The following chapter highlights practical steps that can be taken to mitigate ADD symptoms.In the end, there was not much meat in this book. Tragedy aplenty, but little else."
4,A stellar first book about ADD,"I first read this book in 1995, right after it first came out. It described my son to a T, and described myself nearly so. This update (2011) updates some of the information so it's more current than the original and still a great book. I'd also get the Delivered from Distraction to complement it, however. Both together gives great information about the disorder, how to describe it, how to sense what it does to people, and gives suggestion for teachers and parents."
3,Distracted by a leading publications,"You read this and may nod along with agreement - indeed I went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed as ADHD. The label did not help, nor the medication and eventually I was seen by a UK specialist and told that I'd be ADHD in the US, but I am not in the UK. So a book to read with a warning - let the professionals decide. Other than that there are some life lessons from which all of us would benefitif you go along with the recommendations."
4,You will recognize yourself here ...,I read this book to see if I could determine whether my son has ADD or not. There are excellent questionnaires that really help. I read through some of the chapters with my son and he could really identify with many of the descriptions of ADD behaviour. We took him to a specialist and he was NOT diagnosed with ADD. Just procrastination. ;-)
5,A must read for anyone who has struggled with Executive Functioning disorders,"Spells out how your brain works on ADHD, and why and how to get proper treatment, training, and coping. This books knowledge literally drove me right into the path for straight A's in medical school.I want to gift this book for anyone who has been recently diagnosed or has a child with learning disabilities."
4,Can be Overwhelming for the Average Parent,"As someone who has been involved with ADD and ADHD kids and adults for many years, I found this book to be very helpful in dealing with the issue. However it is a very long read and can be technical for the average person to read.If you are not involved with ADD/ADHD this is not the place to start. Having said that, I feel that this book is an excellent reference source for those who understand the basics of the disorder."
4,Good Book,"This is the first book I have read on ADHD. I was expecting a fairly dry book on symptoms and how to diagnose. The book was much better than from what I expected. It was filled with stories of others and families who have fought this disorder.From stories, to symptoms, even things I did that were ADHD, and I thought it was just me! When you finish the book, if you have ADHD, you are trying to figure out why you never had the author arrested for stalking you and writing down everything you do!"
4,A worthwhile read,"I purchased this book with the intention of learning more about the biology behind my own struggle with A.D.D. However, what I found was a wonderful resource that I could pass on to my boyfriend to help him understand what I was going through. The testimonials and stories from other people with ADD finally allowed me to give words to what it's like the live with ADD. I highly recommend this book for people that are trying to communicate with a significant other or family member but don't know exactly how to explain what they are going through."
5,eye opener,"As far as I am concerned this it the ""Bible of ADD"" I was born before there was a diagnosis of ADD- I have it. I did not find out until I was 40.This book is insightful and very helpful. It covers the many variations of this disorder and the different ways it presents itself in different types of people. I would recommend this book to anyone and I do."
2,No solutions,"The book did a great job identifying ADD, but I was looking for some coping mechanisms. Doctors are quick to give meds for this disorder but I'd like to become knowledgeable and learn to work on improving my life."
3,"Good book, but very redundant","Good information book per se, but the whole book could be summed up in 20 or 30 pages. The author constantly repeats the same points throughout the book, and that can make for a boring read. The book does an excellent job of covering all symptoms of ADD in great detail, but does not provide concrete solutions to the problem..IE ""take medicine, get therapy and make lists to help you remember"". I was expecting a more do it yourself approach with possibly some mental exercises that could help increase concentration or memory."
2,any symptom you have is explained by this book,"if you are looking for ADHD as the explanation of virtually *any* behavior, this is the place to go. The more I read, the more I was convinced that the author has found a laundry list of symptoms - many of which are mutually contradictory - and put them all under the rubric of ADHD. ""You don't focus, or maybe you focus too much"" is the sort of non-explanation that drives me batty with a book like this. Of course, the author would no doubt dismiss my comments as a clear case of ADHD, so there is no way to have a meaningful discussion here."
4,An OK Book on the Subject,"The book has some good ideas but I didn't find it to be easy reading - I had to force myself to keep reading, of course, that's part of the problem they're talking about."
1,Great for therapists...Unhelpful for sufferers.,"It's amazing to me that an author would title a book Driven to Distraction, then lose the reader's interest before finishing chapter 1.I got this audiobook for someone who suffers from ADD, and has someone with reading comprehension difficulties. This book gave her a headache before finishing chapter one."
1,Why No Kindle Edition?,I am quite sick of authors not making their books available in Kindle format. What day and age are we living in where they cannot boost their sales tenfold by simply uploading a PDF ??? Every single time I am recommended a book to read by a good friend I can never find it on Kindle and I hate reading physical books. Come on guys get on board with the modern world !!!!
5,I'm too distracted to review this but I wasn't distracted at all reading it,"Honestly, the title of my review wasn't originally intended to be funny. I came on Amazon to look up the publishing date for a footnote/bibliography reference for this book. I now have spent too much time reading reviews on diet books and updating my other reviews on movies and phones to do this review justice.But if you're looking it up, you don't want a long review anyway. It is the best book in the world for someone with ADD, thinks they might have ADD or someone who has to live with a person with ADD.BUY IT NOW!! Before you get distracted."
4,Helpful,"This was very helpful for me to read for it helped me understand our 21 year old grandson's situation. I did not read it all, but especially did the part about adult relationships at home and at work. Thanks."
5,Living with Distraction,"It was very eye opening and enlightening to essentially read about myself in the context of Dr. Hallowell's personal and professional experience. Though I have never been diagnosed with ADD, nor pursued a diagnosis this late in life, it did bring my own experience into a place that I could easily understand and accept. It also gave me a basis for helping others in my family deal with ADD at a younger age, hopefully with less of the confusion and anxiety that I endured. The writing was very easy to follow, and indeed, done in a way that any ADD sufferer could readily use!"
5,Driven to Distraction,"If you're looking for an easy to understand explanation of ADD/ADHD by two professionals who have it themselves, Driven to Distraction excels! Thanks to Stewart Ater, M. D., (of Houston, TX) who recommended that we read this book when he diagnosed ADHD for our 20 yr. old daughter, this incredible book drastically changed our lives. After years of set backs and searching for answers, we finally found not only the cause, but also the best treatment for the condition. Without the valuable information supplied by the two physicians who wrote this book, we would never have understood so completely what all ADHA entails. Please email us if you would like to ask any questions about this inestimable guide. Robert and Yvonne Turner email: YTurnerLitMom@aol.com"
4,A different light on ADD,"My husband and my son both have ADD. When I began reading this book, even within the first chapter, my anger and frustration towards them subsided. I began to understand that some of the simple things that drove me crazy, not answering me when asked a question, not putting things back where they belong,etc, were things that were very difficult for both of them to accomplish. Learning of the positive sides of this disorder confirmed my belief that neither my husband nor my son were stupid, but just the opposite. I cannot tell you how many times I began crying with overwhelming relief of understanding and of hope while reading this book.I feel better prepared with the challenges our family will be facing in the future."
3,It *WAS* good.,"This is a very well-written book. However, since its publication, the author has written Delivered From Distraction. If you are considering buying a book on ADHD, I would highly encourage you to go for that one instead."
5,This Book Made My Adult ADHD Son A Believer!,"An amazing book. For years we knew our son was ADHD. He got through high school fine, but half way through college began to self destruct. Over and over, since about age 13 we tried to convince him of his problem. He was under psychologist care and just would not accept reality. After a bad reaction to Ritalin, he would NOT allow further treatment. When he was 19 we got finally got him to read excerpts from this book. He saw himself in almost every anecdote. Short story: He got to a doctor, got on a prescription medication, and (make the drug czars saints) he was flat-out cured. He graduated college last Christmas, and landed a dream job in his #1 choice of cities in the country."
4,driven to distractioin,Driven To Distraction : Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from Childhood Through Adulthoodthis came in 2 cd's it is very informative for me and my family
2,Not what I expected,"The description stated that the book was in ""Excellent Condition"", but when the book arrived, the edges of the book were yellowed and something had spilled on the front of the book that I had to scrap off. I was very disappointed in my purchase!"
5,doctor recommended,"I have an 8 year old with ADHD. His doctor recommended this book. It has helped me so much understand this issue. I highly recommend it also if you have a child that was diagnosed or has had this for years. Even if you, yourself have been diagnosed with it yourself. Very easy to understand and it is written by two doctors with ADHD and ADD."
5,Changed My Life!,"I read this book at the age of 19 or 20 after seeing a docter for anxiety attacks. I'm 27 now and I still use to refer back to it. It is an incredible book that help me to understand myself. If you struggle with ADD, this is a must read.Mike"
5,"Excellent resource, very easy to read and understand!!!",I am a MFCC intern working with children and adolescents with ADD and also have relatives with ADD. I cannot express how wonderful this book is. It's so easy to read and it's very informative and filled with great factual information as well as case studies. I learned a lot from this book and find it to be one of the most helpful books on this subject. It should be the textbook in schools for those learning about this subject!
5,Good music,is Good. A bunch of these tracks and the albums they are originally from are rather difficult to find now.
5,"Clone mic, great deal!","This is the same mic that is sold by Carvin, Apex, Etc. and before they modified it, Telefunken sold it as the M-16 for almost a thousand dollars more than the others. Came with a nice wooden box and had there name on it, but identical to the Apex model, google Apex 460 & telefunken M16 and you'll see comparisons done by experts declaring them exact equals.Great sound out of the box, if you don't like it, just uppgrade the tube with a NOS 6027a JAN spec cyrogentically treated replacement and it will truly become unbelievable! For the $$ you can not go wrong!"
3,Not bad pop,"I bought this CD back in 1995 along with Garbage's first album, when both groups had a single on the air. For VOTB, it was ""Scary Kisses."" I would say that the album itself isn't bad for pop music, and in fact it typifies it: a few songs are very good, most are okay, and a few are hmmmmmm.... For me, my favorite is ""Scary Kisses"" followed closely by ""New Day."" The rest of the songs are decent, but from the second song, the album changes tune, so to speak; the first two are pop radio material, and the rest are reserved for tough VOTB fans. I must admit that I preferred the Garbage CD to this one, although I most certainly dig it out often enough. So, buy it if you like 'em, pass it up if you don't."
2,Well...it's different...,"I have been a VOTB fan for many years, dating back to their first release in the late-80s, ""Let It Bee,"" which was one of the first CDs I ever purchased. ""Sex & Misery"" definitely veers away from the catchy guitars-and-drums sound found on earlier releases, which for me was a disappointment. This album uses a larger variety of musical instruments and feels much more like adult contemporary rock, or even Christian rock, than the alternative flavor of their earlier work. The foot-tapping beats are missing, the melodies feel muted and uncompelling (even absent in a couple songs), and the whole of the CD simply lacks luster. The Belland sisters still show an aptitude for writing lyrics that are clever and thought out. If you've never purchased a VOTB album, and you prefer mainstream rock, this CD might be for you. If you already have other VOTB music in your collection...well, just be prepared for something different."
1,cheap,"this book was a disappointment. format was cheap. items like this would rot on the shelves of a bookstore as if you actually saw what you were purchasing, you wouldn't."
4,fun,"This item is fun for the grandkids, not real durable, but if taken care of is well worth the money. It was put in a playroom for 2+ year olds to watch movies,etc and works well"
3,Nice but not great!,"It will work, but....I really wanted something really soft and this feels like the padding is too thin. I love the idea of it and I will keep it but its not what I pictured. It seems to be on the inexpensive side and maybe paying under $200, this is what you get. I think I will be able to re cover it and add padding if I choose to in the future. I have a 17 month old and a 6 month old so I figure I can pass it down to the next one."
1,Too small,"It is just a sofa for baby, a little dispointed.why not describe clearly about the product?It is even too small for my son."
4,So Far I Like It,"This is a nice ring. It's a darker blue than pictured, and the cubic zirconia's seem to be not as sparkly as when I first got it, but hopefully they will polish up a little with a jewelry cloth."
5,A very nice sequel!,"This is a more traditional volume of work, the sequel to Heroines of the Soviet Union...yet it breaks ground in that author Henry Sakaida & artist Christa Hook take on some less than well known subjects and bring them to life magnificently. The stories are inspiring and worthy of Hollywood epics yet the men who lived them saw themselves as merely ordinary folk doing what needed to be done...and there is the genius of this book.Highly recommended!"
3,I will feel better if it cuts to half pages,The first 48 pages is an introduction to internet and xml. Will this level of introduction helpful anyway to people without knowledge of internet or xml? Or who needs that level of introduction if he knows internet and xml?From page 343 onwards is appendix and index. 480-343=137. So totally 48+137=185 pages out of 480 are basicly nothing. You got 300 pages left which could be helpful.A good developer does not necessary be a good author.
2,Not the best book on Cocoon.,I was happy with this book after reading the first few chapters however after I got stuck into Cocoon I discovered that it was not suitable as a reference. I couldn't find information on XML fragments or i18n. The index isn't good at all. The information may be in there but you will have to read the book from cover to cover to get value from it. I would recommend going for the Cocoon Developers Handbook.
3,I will feel better if it cuts to half pages,"~There is introduction on Internet and XML up to page 48. Who needs an introduction of Internet and XML if he is trying to work on Cocoon? Does that introduction helpful if one has no knowledge of Internet or XML anyway?There are appendix from page 343 to the end, page 480, that's 137 pages, plus 48 pages, totally 185 pages is basicly nothing. So you got less than 300 pages left maybe useful.I buy this book since there are only 3 books about Cocoon in the market. Now I am a bit regret.A~~ good developer does not mean a good author.~"
2,CForm Rules,Please please please... if any author wants to write another cocoon book make it as updated as you can. I got two cocoon books (I guess everyone knows what they are since there aint a lot of them around!). In a weeks time I was up and running. But then it was announced XMLForm and JXForms have been removed from the 2.1.x distribution flushing all efforts down the drain. Dont get me wrong. Good books... Only outdated.
2,Grooming spray for tangles,"I was hoping to find a product that would make brushing easier and less tangled. I have a toy poodle. This product didn't do that but it had a nice fresh smell. I love the way she smells naturally so wasn't too keen on having a spray that had a scent but this scent was okay, not too much or overpowering. My groomer told me to use dog conditioner on her while bathing and that has worked very well for the tangles. This product just didn't work the way I had hoped."
4,Turned out to be really good.,"I wasn't too into this scent at first because of how weak it was. I bought these sprays for the Verry Berry scents (which is phenomenal), but felt like buying one of these other ones just to try them out. I was peasently surprised after a while. It isn't a weak scent but more like a fresh scent. That is what this one has. So, if you're looking for something to give your pets a fresh scent, this rainforest spray is the one."
5,Love it - Rainforest scent is the best,"Crazy pet also makes shampoos - the rainforest scent is the best, and keeps my dog smelling great for weeks! This spray is great between baths. Love it. Will never use another brand again. Nothing smells as great or lasts as long."
5,Quiet and relaxing,"For anyone interested in natural sounds and who loves some peace and solitude, this is a wonderful way to engage with it, especially if you live in a more urban setting. I listen to this with Bose headphones to further cancel out man made noises that are constantly occurring around me- it is so nice to escape into the quiet. Also, I'm sad to say that you should grab some of these recording because what is on it may well be extinct."
3,Rogue reveiw,Package arrived safe and packed well. Instrument is of an entry level variety. Set up was poor from factory and unplayable. Upon tuning up to pitch with factory strings 3 of them broke.
2,Not Goth,A disappointing colletion of mostly b-side tunes. Pretty In Pink as a goth anthem??? This set is NOT worth buying. I strongly recommend Goth Industrial Club Anthems released by Cleopatra instead.
1,Got the wrong thing...twice.,"Two times I ordered this item and both times I was sent some weird 80s movie (the same movie both times) that I threw out. Not bothering trying to have them replace it. Still don't have what I actually ordered so can't really comment on the actual product, just never buying from the vendor again."
2,Very Disappointing!!!,"For starters, I only got the 3rd disk, and it pretty much sucks! The only song I kind of like is Pretty in Pink, but I like it better when The Grown-Ups sings. This is NOT goth! I would not recommend THE GOTH ANTHOLOGY!!!"
4,It sounds interesting to me...,It really does. I have not bought this yet (and probably won't for a while)but i like industrial stuff so... i may buy this one day.
5,Excellent Source of American Revolution Uniforms,"Mollo and McGregor have produced an excellent source for anyone interested in researching American Revolutionary War uniforms.Thankfully, the authors produced color plates of American, English, French, and Hessian uniforms. The pictures are eye-catching and based on the authors' extensive research, appear to be accurate.Additonally, the authors even produced color plates of various flags, swords, hats, and muskets.All in all, an excellent source of information. Highly recommended!"
5,"Exactly what I need, a miraculous find.","I am drawing a comic that takes place during the Revolutionary days in America, and I really needed a book with accurate colored drawings of of American, British, Hessian, French etc. soldiers.And when I opened the book to find just this, I was absolutely thrilled- It provides many, many pages of illustrations that will work just perfect for me. There are also illustrations of weapons and flags used, which I also find very useful.For a long time I've been searching for a book like this. I couldn't be more pleased."
4,"Sad, funny, great rock and roll","I bought this at a second-hand CD store when I sold a bunch of vinyl LPs and accumulated so much credit I didn't know how to spend it. Fortunately, I stumbled across this gem, from a hard-working Canadian band that has gone through several iterations but really got it all together on this disk. I'm So F**king Happy, I'm Not Like Madonna....it's pensive, sometimes dark, always tongue in cheek."
5,Unexpectedly great album!,So here's yet another indie band whose hard work languishes in a few used bins. The record is actually one of those great sleepers. If you enjoy Fountains of Wayne or The Odds - check this out.
5,"In-depth and absorbing, a ""must"" for bibliophiles.","This treatise is recommended to even the most involved specialty library, as well as anyone concerned with literary history at the college level. This is an important reference, with the first volume covering the colonial book in the atlantic world. Publishing, writing, and book history is related from the start of the colonial period in America through 1790, with important connections made between the book trade and cultural exchange between English and American audiences. In-depth and absorbing."
5,Thought-provoking Movie Watching,"I used this book with a class of 13 year old boys. Finding their powers of perception sharpened after only two sessions, their excitement in viewing old movies was incredibly palpable. Interestingly, black and white movies took on a new dimension with Sam Spade and ""The Maltese Falcon"". Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, who liven up ""The Philadelpha Story"", made romantic comedies a new interest for the young men. While watching ""The Music Man"" they boys were introduced to ""Trouble with a capital T"" and the memorable ""76 Trombones"" which they still reference to this day. As a teacher, I learned a great deal of insight about these movies and my class has been trained to watch these old classics in a new thought-provoking way."
4,Movies at Literature,This is a great book with excellent movie selection and questions. We are using this as a directed family conversation which makes the student workbook unnecessary.
2,Forgettable...,"I didn't respond to this self-indulgent, unnecessary, misguided yawn of a film. I can sympathize with the effort to give exposure to the film maker by his student/biographer, but the product was, to me, a dull, almost silly, attempt to present a 'serious' philosophical piece.I can't say anymore, mainly because I'm boring myself with the effort."
3,Description is not accurate,"For what it is, this item isn't too bad, but I would suggest that no one pay full suggested retail price for it but rather buy it on sale.I DO object to it being described as a ""hardcover"" book with the kit, as what you get is 2.5 x 3 inches in size (fits inside the little box that the kit comes in) and is bound in cardstock -- hardly ""hardcover"" in my opinion.While the booklet may be interesting/helpful to those who are completely brand new to kaleidoscopes, most of its 32 pages are devoted to the history of kaleidoscopes, anecdotes about people using kaleidoscopes to meditate etc., and only 3 pages at the back are devoted to giving instructions on assembly of the kit. There is nothing in the booklet to aid someone who may wish to persue kalaidoscope-building further -- I think it should have a few pages devoted to other types of kaleidoscopes (2-, 4-, 5+-mirror systems, plus teleidoscopes) one could pursue building on one's own."
5,HR Manager,"Provides the most comprehensive and practical tools for improving this vital people skill, managing conflict and disagreement constructively."
5,The best hamster wheel!!,Don't listen to all these negative reviews! This is the best hamster exercise wheel on the market. We have our hamster in our room and it is so super quiet. We haven't had a problem with the product at all and we've had it for 8 months!Highly recommended
2,"How big is ""regular""?","In choosing which products I would like to purchase on Amazon, I've noticed that most product descriptions are very vague or misleading. For example this product. How big is ""regular""? Regular size for a mouse or regular size for a rat? Why is it so hard to put at least the diameter of the wheel in the description? I'm not going to buy a product like this unless I have more information."
2,NOT FOR SYRIANS!,"Yes this wheel is whisper quiet BUT it is simply too small for most,if not all Syrian hamsters. Now I'm not saying this wouldn't be a great wheel for dwarf hamsters, mice, or other smaller animals BUT it definitely is for Syrians. Running on a wheel this size can not only be uncomfortable for your hamster, it can cause spinal damage over time due to the angle of the back. My hamster Puff (when I put this wheel and a larger wheel in her cage) chose the larger wheel 100% of the time. I recommend the WARE flying saucer 12"". It's safe, attractive, and just as quiet!"
4,Don't immerse in water.,"The internal bearing can get rusty if you immerse it in water. Don't! Besides that, the wheel works great. I am not annoyed by how often you need to clean it like others said... it's a good reminder to clean the cage :) I wish we didn't ruin two wheels by immersing them in water :("
2,"Silent, but short lifespan","The product has a short life span. The two that we've bought have each lasted about 10 weeks before the plastic piece connecting the wheel to the stand breaks.Before it breaks, though, it is quite quiet. Our gerbils like it, and it feels safe for them because they cannot get their tails caught in it."
2,Excellent but not durable,"Like other reviewers, I thought this was an excellent wheel until the plastic piece where the axle attaches to the stand broke after only about 2 months. It really is super silent, but needs a better design or stronger material at it's weak points."
4,Good wheel,"There are not too many options for gerbil wheels, but this is the best one I've found for my gerbils. It is a good size and it spins fairly quietly. However, my gerbils like to knock it over pretty often, so the base could probably be a little heavier."
4,Great wheel,"It's very quiet, much quieter than the wheel that had originally come with the cage I had. My pet mice absolutely love running on wheels, but the old wheel was driving me nuts at night. I did notice that after a few weeks, this wheel started clunking when it turned. I tried tightening the nut that attached the wheel to the bearing, and that got rid of that problem. Like all solid wheels, it does tend to pick up grime, but I think the tradeoff in comfort for my pets with wire wheels in terms of cleaning requirements isn't worth it. This wheel can also be attached to the side of standard wire cages, a fact that wasn't immediately apparent from the picture, but was definitely a pleasant surprise. My only gripe is that I couldn't choose the color, but that's a pretty minor detail."
4,"Great for my mice, but small for my hamster","I considered buying the mini wheel at first, but I am glad I didn't. This wheel is the perfect size for my two mice, but my hamster has a hard time running on it. I don't want to buy the large wheel because it is too big, but the regular size is too small. The wheel is quite silent compared to metal wheels and it has held up so far. I clean it almost everyday because it is closed and the animals like to pee on it. I have owned these two wheels for about 4-6 weeks and haven't noticed any real problems besides size so far."
5,Great!,"It is the only hamster wheel I've known of which is truly silent, and stays silent. This size is a _little_ too small for my syrian hamster, and I can't seem to find a larger one, but it is not a big deal since he can still use it. Would recommend this to others."
3,Can't Keep it Clean,"I have puchased several of these with no problems at all with quality/durability. I loved these Silent Spinners until I purchased two hamsters that insist on using the bathroom while running on the wheel.... Because there are no holes there is nowhere for the droppings to fall, thus we have a huge mess of speared hamster droppings on the wheel that has to be washed daily, which is a pain."
4,Good wheel...,"Our (light weight) teddy bear hamster has used this wheel for over 2 years. I agree it is not silent, but as long as it stays on top of the wood chips, we are happy with it because it is very quiet. When it has become a little squeaky we put some cooking oil on the screw and it fixes the problem. It has never broke or become unscrewed on its own. It cleans easily also."
5,Finally some sleep,"This wheel has been just as expected. It fits an older Critter Trail cage we have, but not the newer one with the bars closer together. It does come with a stand, but we haven't needed it. So far very quiet--now all of us non-nocturnals can get some sleep!"
3,Too small & tips over,"My gerbils feet run off the edges. They can't really get going fast. It's not wide enough because of the curve shape. The other added flaw is that gerbils quickly learn how to push it over to chew on the metal stand. I stand it up. They push it over. They chew the paint off the stand. I'd say it would be good for mice or dwarf hampsters, but not gerbils."
4,Silent,My hamsters are in my bedroom so I kinda NEED a silent wheel. This is very silent but after awhile of use it starts to rattle. All you have to do is push on the back part that goes on the bars and screw the middle piece back on and it's good as new.
5,Hamster Loves It,Its a great wheel seems sturdy. Its more silent then the other wheels I have tried. I like the fact that i can use it attached to the cadge or with the stand
1,Splendid until the shimmy,"All was well the first few weeks. Nearly silent operation. During the third week, however, it began developing a wobble that got progressively worse. After another week, the wheel would shuffle to the edge of the cage and rattle against the side.Tried taping down the stand, which of course prevented its movement along the cage floor. But it seems the wobble rendered the wheel less appealing. Pre-wobble, Ms. Hamster (name changed for her privacy :] ) made ample use of it. Post-wobble, wheel-time started dropping. Now, she doesn't try it at all.I'm handy, but repairing it isn't feasible, as the source of the wobble is within an enclosed wheel bearing mechanism. So, after about a month, this wheel's come to a halt.A decent design, perhaps, but problematic execution. More attention to quality control is indicated."
1,Dangerous! PLEASE READ,"I bought this item for my two gerbils. The first few minutes, I was pleased. Then, it started to appear rickety. I left for a few hours, and when I returned home, I saw the wheel was toppled over. One of my gerbils was stuck underneath. There were no breathing holes. Thankfully, I was gone for only a little while, so my gerbil was ok. The rest of the night, my gerbil sat in the corner, scared. Please don't buy this, for the safety of your hamster or gerbil."
1,Where does the poop go?,"As advertised, this wheel is silent. That is the only good thing I can say about it. It is FILTHY!! I clean it twice a week and that is not near enough. My mouse poops in it while running and there is no place for the poop to get out. He just runs in it, getting it all mashed in and gross. I'm going back to the old noisy wire type."
5,"I wish this book was out when I was a newlywed...and it's still a great read for us ""seasoned"" wives.","A friend couldn't say enough great things about this book, & I have highly recommended this book to other friends. It's an easy read that I wish was out when I first married into the military. Jacey talks about issues many of us face &- though difficult- aways has a realistic & positive outlook. Newlywed, ""sesoned,"" enlisted & officer friends have thoroughly enjoyed it. Jacey makes me want to be a better person. The book reads like Jacey is sitting with a friend and sharing. It's funny and gets to the heart of difficult times as well. A must read for any military wife!"
5,Highly Recommended,"This book is a definite must-read for any military spouse. I also recommend it for extended military family, to help them understand what life is like in the home of their servicemember. Eckhart offers good advice, much-needed encouragement and a realistic outlook. It might ruffle a few feathers on those who are more liberal or lean toward a feminist mindset. If that's you, you're probably not going to be too content as a military spouse anyway. However, one of Eckhart's points is we're all from different backgrounds, but we're in the same boat and should help each other out. That's something we should all learn to do, whether we are liberal, conservative, working, staying at home, etc."
1,Not for everyone,OK I really hate this book I ha a hard time getting into it but I kept reading hoping it will get better not so much it to me seems very contradictory and isn't really and good advise for a military family more like just her opinion's and a little of what she may have experienced. I actually found it a little depressing. I let a few others read this book and so far they have all felt the same way. Not at all what I was looking for.
3,too many choices - shot at wide angle with too much hearth framing fire,I like the Sierra Nevada Cabin fireplace dvd much better. This is all letterbox framing so part of your tv screen is black. Way too much hearth shots - they should add a direct shot of the interior of the fireplace without a hearth shot. The choice of hearths doesn't do a good roaring fire justice.
2,There are better Fireplaces than this.,"1)Each fireplace is around 8-10 minutes, too short.2)Not that high definition.3)8 fireplaces, but only 2 look good.4)Was let down in a nutshell.5)I prefered the OUTPOSTFX (Plasma DV) fireplace, the fireplace takes around 40 minutes to wear out and it looks much better."
4,Great fireplace video,"I like the video, it has several different kinds of fireplaces, and a Holiday scene. You can play it with music or you can listening to the crackling sounds of real fire. My daughter had some friends that stopped by, and they thought it was real! :) It somehow makes the room warmer on a cold day :)"
2,Living Fireplace Let Down,"After reading the reviews, I bought this DVD. I was disappointed at how unrealistic the fires are. They burn way too fast. And the music selection is very limited. Any music choice, just plays 1 song, and continuously loops. So if you select Christmas- you get Jingle Bells over and over. The high def, is definitely NOT! Overall, my husband and I were very unpleased. We suggest you keep looking (we are)!"
2,Saw not as shown and blade won't stay on,"The saw I received did not look like this one. Instead of what appears to be metal screws in the picture. The saw has little plastic triangular shaped pieces that can easily break and at times you have to tighten them to the point where they block your work. Unfortunately that wasn't the worst thing about it.I tried to saw a 1"" line through a very thin, soft copper coupler. The saw repeatedly let go of the blade which I was able to pull out of the slot by hand, so it was not due to undue torque. The blade was not pulled lose, the screws that were holding it simply came loose. I was able to insert another blade freely without loosening the holder. The EXACTO saw appears to have the same problem from the review I read. You may want to pass on that one as well.At this point after struggling with it again I would give it ONE star or better yet no stars. It was a waste of money. I'm back to using a coping saw."
3,Just O.K.,"I really like the set up of Lonely Planets Best Of travel guides. Couldn't find one for this area so tried this book. All the info is in this guide, but is difficult and time consuming to find."
4,Great game!!!!!,If you are a true trek fan and you have bought other st-sc you truly need this one this game is great overall!!!!
5,A MUST READ,"Sidewalk is a detailed look into the everyday life of Greenwich Street homeless dwellers. The author illustrates through social structure assessment, how these men affect the social order on the sidewalk. The book also touches on the struggles and injustices that these men endure, while they try to make a honest living selling books and magazines. I found some of the their life stories to be significantly tragic, but at the same time hilarious. This book is a must read and shouldn't be overlooked. I wouldn't be surprise if a movie deal or book award is currently in the works for this non-fiction literature masterpiece."
5,A Great Book,"I suggest this book to anyone who wants to understand the life of the poor and ""unhoused"" and subsisting people of America. It is very moving and rigorous."
3,the real stuff,"At a moment when crass pols like NY's Mayor Giuliani would demonize all homeless people with a broad brush, Dr. Duneier has given us a look at a group of street people that suggest the diversity, humanity, and worth of a segment of society heretofore misunderstood and neglected.Spike is right--this is great sociology. And, for lay readers, a rare insight into a group of people we might walk by each day without any basis of understanding. Like the author's ""Slim's Table"", this is good reading and provocative scholarship."
5,Sidewalk,"Mitchell Dunier's endevor into the life of the men who work on the sidewalks of Greenwich Village, New York is an incredible success. This book paints a vivid portrait of the lives and livlihoods of such men. Great book."
3,A Bird's Eye View,"This is a book with fine photography by Ovie Carter. However the impression given by the author Mitchell Duneier is the New York City sidewalk vendors are only poor African Americans. Granted he focuses on one specific group and location in Greenwich Village. The book is well written as a study of that vending. He describes that particular group in great detail. It would have been good if he had shown or emphasized something about the street vendors who are not necessarily poor in a thriving Harlem. In addition there is a potpourri of nationalities of street vendors throughout New York City including Asian, South Asian, African, Hispanic and white Americans. Without this kind of framework Duneier reinforces a negative stereotype of African Americans in New York City."
3,Well intentioned,"Hi! I happened upon this book at the store and was surprised to see another project about this issue (I saw a pretty good documentary screening last year about this same topic, but it took a different approach as it was made by one of the sidewalk booksellers himself)The author here seems well intentioned in his research, but the books strikes me a little too much as ""middle class white professor comes to New York to reveal the plight of the oppressed black street guys and in the process becomes one of them"" sort of thing. It would be so much more refreshing to see the story told by one of the guys out there, rather than have it told by someone else.But I'm glad the message is getting out there, because all the sidewalk vendors seem to be getting it pretty bad."
5,Great Stuff,"My GSD and POM love these things I even cut in small pieces and ad to the Poms food when she gets fenicky, great for both there Joint problems."
4,Great Austin Sound,Toni's voice has a bluesy quality and that great Austin sound. Looking forward to hearing more from this artist and would like to see her tour outside the Texas area. She should come to Chicago!
4,Scholarship and Solidarity,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A fine study of the ""philanthropologist"" Verrier Elwin, who went from Oxford cleric to tribal scholar/activist, living among various groups of 'aboriginal' Indians and taking up their causes. Elwin was the first Englishman to gain Indian citizenship after independence, but constantly wrote against those in power (at a state or a national level) who attempted to destroy tribal ways of life. Extremely interesting discussion of the delicate negotiation of a suitable rhetoric in the overheated debates around such issues. Deftly illuminates the contradictions of nationalism and the postcolonial state, where hegemonic identity politics attempts to dominate those on the margins, all in the name of 'liberation'. Important and NECESSARY corrective to simple assumptions about what postcoloniality involves. I recommend it highly. A good read!"
5,Please,I am very pleased with the article and have been attempting to purchase for some time with most vendors not wanting to ship to Canada. The purchase and delivery were very satisfactory. The use of USPS is in my mind superior to UPS for small articles.
5,Great fusing book,I have been fusing for 3 years now. I started with this book and still look back and get good ideas. You evolve and still can get something on a different level. Buy it.
4,A couple of really cool projects even for the moderately skilled.,Long review of basics well written then the rest of the book has projects. A couple of really cool projects even for the moderately skilled.
3,Pretty but shallow,"I bought this book based on reviews from this page. I agree that the projects are beautiful and the artist very talented. The book is not really a ""how to"" in my opinion as it gives very sketchy technical information on all three glass techniques. I would not feel comfortable investing in an expensive kiln and supplies or attempting these projects without reading a far more thorough treatment of the subject first. It is very inspirational to look at: pretty but shallow."
3,not for anyone interested in lampworking,"Although the sections on fusing and painting glass are extensive, the lampworking section is very rudimentary. Those interested in this topic would better be served by looking at the excellent Cindy Jenkins book 'Making Glass Beads'."
5,This book is a must have for fusers.,"This book is excellent. Of all the books I have purchased on fusing, this is the one I keep going back to. The information is presented in an understandable and straight forward manner. Bettina Eberle covers a wide variety of techniques that will allow the reader to expand their abilities. The projects in this book are ones you really want to do. The projects are very detailed and the techniques used are fully explained. If you are looking for ideas and accurate instructions for a variety of beautiful fusing projects, this book is for you."
1,A disaster from start to finish!,"I had to get two replacements for this toaster...one from the manufacturer, and one from Amazon...in less than a year! For an ""all metal"" toaster, it has many plastic parts, including the dial. An overpriced piece of junk..I finally returned it, bought a twenty dollar toaster and have not had any problems since!"
5,What a deluxe toaster,"I find this toaster a high end product. It has an unusual design shape, making it so much easier to insert the bread and remove it. I have a blue one. One of the few toasters that come in blue is also a plus for me. Feels like a good solid toaster, well built and does a good job of toasting bagels as well as toast....I am really happy with mine..."
5,Great toaster,Wife loves it. I love it. Solid (all metal) and very easy to use. Very consistent results. Impressed with the metal baffles between heating elements and food which even out heat. Only time will tell how durable it is (have only had it 2 months).
4,"Good toaster, no problems.",I bought this toaster after reading the reviews here. I was not disapointed. I like it. I gave it 4 stars because of the height and that crumbs get caught in the exterior grove around the top. Other than that it toasts very nicely and the slots are large. Toasts fat bagels without getting stuck. Finish is nice.
5,BEST ever owned/used,I'll keep it simple. If you are more grown up and the college toaster is no longer cutting it...this is the toaster for you! Awesome. Very even toasting. Adjusts nicely. Easy to clean. Attractive and heavy for a nice kitchen that will be kept on counter for frequent use.
5,Great Toaster,"I love this toaster, Hamilton Beach is my new fav brand. I have been through many ugly toasters that looked worn in about a week and this one is different. It's heavy and easy to wipe down. You can fit almost anything into the slots --and the color--the best! I originaly bought the coffeemaker by HB just for the color and was so impressed by the quality I went for the toaster too. I have the yellow and it was an inexpensive easy way to update and cheer up by kitchen. This is the first time I haven't covreed up my toaster when company comes."
2,Worked great.........at first,"Was happy with this toaster until I had it for about 4 months.At that time the lever started acting up by not staying down.Sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down. Not what I expect from a $70 toaster. Well, I have finally given up (2 months later) and am sending it back to Hamilton Beach since too much time has passed to send it to Amazon. They are sending me a new one, which I am not sure I am happy about. Might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster-oven.........."
3,honestly they just don't make'em like they used to...,"it's super cute, it doesn't get too hot on the outside, it does get my toast the right color... sort of. OK, a huge complaint i have with other new toasters, is that they simply don't TOAST bread on the first go. You have to toast it once, then toast it again. This one is pretty good at only needing one round of toasting.That said, it is terribly uneven, at least by my 50s Toastmaster standards. But my Toastmaster couldn't handle bagels, and the timer was broken so you had to make sure you didn't forget you were using it. (this lead to many episodes of neighbors knocking on our doors to tell us there was a fire... no, just our shoddy toaster.) honestly i would prefer my old toaster but i couldn't find anyone who could fix it so i finally gave up and bought this HB one. and it's... OK. Not great, but better than most of the junkie toasters on the market these days."
1,"Beautiful Toaster, but it failed in a week",This is an all metal toaster with a very clever setting for bagels; you can toast only the cut side of the bagel! It looks great on the counter and matched the black coloring of our other appliances. But after one week the hold down lever failed and the bread wouldn't stay in the toaster. Fortunately it was not difficult to return. I bought a Sunbeam for $9.99 and it works well.
2,Hamilton Beach Eclectrics All Metal Toaster/Apple Green,"I recently received this toaster hamilton beach eclectrics I hate it. Its not what I thought I was getting. Its huge and weighs a ton.The color is beautiful and it works ok not great,just not what I thought I ordered. I thought it was a flat top toaster but it has a slanted top.I was told by amazon that all hamilton beach toasters are like the one I got. I ordered other appliances to go with the toaster soI am stuck with it. Too bad. I won't being buying anything else from Amazon ever."
2,Disappointing Shortcuts,"I am a serious baker, and was excited about the idea of a dessert book that would allow me to make guilt-free sugar-free cakes and pies. Guilt-free, yes, but that's about it. I don't mean to sound like a snob, but I'm not interested in cake recipes that call for Sweet-n-Low brand cake MIX as their main ingredient. I thought this was supposed to be a cookbook? I can get those kinds of recipes off the side of a box.Fine if you're interested in quick and easy. Not very satisfying if you want to make from-scratch desserts with real ingredients. I'm afraid I'll be sending this back."
1,Not quite what I expected,"Instead of original recipes, many of Ms. Broihier's call for using ready made mixes, ready made cookies and ready made chocolate bars...Not my idea of a cookbook... what do I need the cookbook for? I could just bake the cake mix, eat the cookies and enjoy the chocolate as is.... the rest are pretty common.... take some heavy cream and whip it with some flavoring or other.....when she does offer some original recipes, many include non low carb items like real flour etc. Even small amounts, are not part of my ingredients any more...."
1,A Waste of Money,"This shouldn't even be called a cookbook. It is completely useless. Almost every single so-called recipe called for Atkins Bake Mix. For those of you who don't know, Atkins stopped manufacturing this product years ago.The few recipes that don't call for Atkins Mixes call for Sweet N Low cake mixes, a product which has as its first ingredient ""bleached flour"" and has 36g of carbohydrates per serving. HOW IS THAT LOW CARB?Perhaps someone should have educated this author on the difference between low sugar and low carb.Apparently, anyone can now add chocolate chips or coconut to pre-made bake mixes and publish that as a cookbook."
1,Sugar and prepared mixes in recipes,"As an MS/RD author Kitty Broihier knows that sugar is a highly processed, high carb type of food. Just one tablespoon has almost 12 grams of carbs. Yet she includes this ingredient in many of her low-carb recipes. Broihier also relies heavily on prepared mixes to make her recipes work. Even more, sugar and highly processed flours are triggers for binge-eaters and out-of-control eaters, which may be a problem for up to 40% of the overweight population. I recommend George Stella's excellent book, Livin Low Carb, instead of this."
2,needed expensive storebought mix,I wish I had been warned that I would need to buy things like Atkins bake mix and other prepackaged additives to make most of these recipes. I don't have the money or the access to Atkins bake mix; and if I'm going to buy that I may as well just buy premade low-carb desserts.
5,Good Reference,"Wow!After reading the last review, I thought I should add a slightly different opinion.I have FileMaker Pro Advanced (Visual Quickstart) in both version 5 & 6. (And I am eagerly awaiting for Version 7 to come out.) I do FileMaker Development for a living, so I might have a slightly different perspective. I have always found these Visual QuickStart books to be very helpful and I currently have FileMaker Pro 6 Advanced on my desk next to my computer. If you could look at my copy you would see it full of stickies noting some of the areas I frequently look up.This book has been invaluable to me as a reference. I can tell you honestly that I have never read it cover to cover. I just look at the great index in the back and it usually points me to the areas I need to look up. I have been designing FileMaker databases for 10 years and I still found lots of new and helpful information in this book. I still consider it a ""MUST"" for anyone who does FileMaker database design."
1,FileMaker Pro 6 Advanced for Windows and Macintosh: Visual Q,"Don't waste your money on this one. Although titled ""Advanced"" it assumes the reader is a total idiot and absolutely unfamiliar with FileMaker. Steps are spelled out so painfully click by click that it is impossible to follow what is being explained. The screen shots are too small to be legible. A real waste of money and printing paper."
2,Only Somewhat Helpful in Mastering FileMaker,"I've purchased numerous Peachpit Visual Quickbooks. Most of them are excellent. This one, however, is deficient is some respects. The most glaring problem is the puny size of the screen shots--you need a magnifying glass to see them! Also, the book is not coherent; it starts off with a fine concept for a school course/student/instructor database, but then doesn't work with this example throughout the book. There are no sample files on CD or diskette or on a Web site that I can find. The only saving grace is that the price of the book is reasonable, and you may pick up a few useful tips. Let's hope the version for FileMaker 7 is better."
1,Excellent music however recording engineer ruined the cd,"Recording engineer Conny Peters has done it again. What could have been an excellect CD was turned into a less than satisfactory one. André's violin sounds like a cheap toy. Improper microphone placement, incorrect recording levels are but a few of the problems found with this CD."
4,Geodesic Math and how to Use It,"I have been researching geodesics for a while and have found this book valuable in understanding the subject, however, I would suggest downloading some of the NASA tech briefs about geodesic math (and its free) before spending this amount of money on a book. There are several online sources of info to help the novice."
5,"I respect the quality of this booklet but would appreciate a"" heads up"" on the degree of mathematically difficulty",Technically excellent book. Far too much higher math for the average consumer. No question an excellent resource for those who have that sort of higher mathematical education. For the rest of us it is useless.
5,Best Quality Cinnamon Sticks I've Had,"I bought a couple of 3 oz. packs. Each 3 oz. pack contained (7) 10 inch sticks of cinnamon. I found this great product from an upscale ACME supermarket in the suburbs. The quality was superb; unlike any that I've had before.The product was of such good quality that I decided to shop it on the web and low and behold, Amazon had the best pricing. I order this product and it got to me on time. I am very pleased. This was a good deal. By ordering it in bulk, I saved money (only $1.38/3oz. pack vs $2.00/3 oz. pack at the supermarket). Yeah, this is a winner.Regards,Regina J Brown, Mobile Notary Signing AgentPennsylvaniaReginaJBrown.com"
4,Bicycle Tire Inflator,"I've used the hell out of mine for about four or five years. Wheelchair rugby players clued me in and said everything else they used failed quickly. I've had mine apart a couple of times and replaced the air hose with something that will really hold over 140 psi. Easy to take apart and I suspect you can replace the battery if necessary. I make sure I keep it charged although I'm not especially careful and they battery is hanging in there. For the price, it's better than anything I've seen."
4,Second one I've bought.,It's the second one of this type I've bought. I gave the first one to my son. It's the most compact & portable. It holds a charge a long time. It can be charged from home or the car. Sturdy. Here's my complaint--the gauge is not calibrated correctly. Both this one & the one I've had before are not accurate readings of air pressure. This one is off by almost 5 pounds.
1,Good things DO NOT [always] come in small packages!,"Purchased to replace portable air tank. I used it three times [two bicycle tires and partial inflation of car tire to 36 psi] over a period of approximately six months.Attempted to inflate a water device and battery indicator was 'Low' after 3-5 minutes. After charging for four days, it still reads 'Low' and strange noises coming from the case - but not enough air to inflate volleyball!"
1,Wears out easily - blows fuses,I have had two of these. The first overheated and burned out. The 2nd one when fairly new somehow jammed the piston at exact top and wouldn't turn. It kept blowing fuses. I took apart and moved by hand but when put back together it couldn't get pressure over 30 lbs. The air volume is very low too. I'm now shopping for a 110 volt unit with more air volume.
5,10 years and counting,"I've had one of these for 10 years, including a few with a car with rusted rims and chronically flat tires. At this point, it'll still fill 8 tires on a charge. You can fit the ac adapter and a dial gauge in the compartments. The pressure gauge on the top was never accurate. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has tires."
3,Air Pump,Received unit. Works well but rattled. Opened unit and 3 pieces of plastic fell out. Not sure where they should be. Very disappointing as I thought C / H made quality products.
1,Bad experience from seller,The product would be great but it was damaged in shipping or warehouse andseveral plastic internal pieces were broke and battery slides back and forthContacted seller and no response from them which is sad customer relations.The product seems to work but not sure if I should try and use it in it'scurrent status.
1,Bad battery - dangerous,"Bad design... The two doors that cover the hose and charger cords are not hinged or tethered, can easily be misplaced. Battery has been overheating during charging and has melted the bottom of the unit. LED indicators show low battery charge.I do not trust it. I will keep it as long as the pump works."
1,Another Epic Fail,"There is a problem with this product. This product fails at the basic level and purpose for which is designed for. The inner rubber sleeve on the quick connect is installed incorrectly or is defective. By the time I finished adjusting the air in 4 tires, the sleeve was so badly deteriorated, that it was no longer functioning properly. Please be advised that if you continue to use the defective valve, it will require excessive force to release the valve from the tire...which also is a potential safety issue. I had an identical inflator that was also manufactured by Campbell Hausfeld, I used it for several years before it finally stopped working - I never experienced this problem. What a disappointment. Do not buy!"
3,Only okay,"I had it for about three years (early 2007), used it maybe 4-5 times a year. I bought it to keep in the car trunk. Recharged it regularly as recommended. But after a year, it became less reliable. Air pressure was inconsistent from one use to the next, weak-to-fine, gauge would often stay at zero. It was a 50-50 proposition whether it would refill my tire. When it worked, it was fine but reliability was the issue. Finally, yesterday, it wouldn't inflate tire at all. When I locked down the valve, the pressure dropped. So, in my case, the battery was not the problem but the pump section just wouldn't work right.[Updated 2012]This spring, just as I was about to clean out the trunk and throw it out, I had a thought and decided to try it with the car adapter. Surprise, surprise, it worked fine. So, I guess the problems was the battery after all. Maybe this will help someone. Okay, it's kind of an obvious test I guess."
1,Piece of Junk,"This item was used mainly to inflate basketballs, footballs, floating devices and topping off tires. Its good for the light duty fill-ups, however, it is awful for tires. It is too weak and the pressure gauge was never accurate. Additionally, to use the unit, it must have a full battery charge. If the battery dies and you think you can just plug it in and it will work, you are mistaken. It only draws power from the battery. Good only if you plan on using it for sporting goods."
2,Battery problems are a huge pain,"My father had an inflator that you could plug in to a standard wall socket. I wanted one like that, but they're hard to find anymore. Unfortunately, this battery-powered one is a huge pain. The battery hardly ever holds a charge. There are all sorts of ""rules"" about how to store, charge, and use it in order not to screw up the battery. I'm on my second battery (provided free of charge when the first one ate it) but it's already gone bad as well. I have to charge it right before I use it, and I get very little out of it. All I want is something to pump up my vehicle tires every now and again (a few pounds each tire) - is that too much to ask? Don't waste your money."
5,no more floppy tires!,"i absolutely LOVE this thing! i was one of those people who drove around on floppy tires because i wasn't sure how to use the air hoses at the self-serve gas station.pitiful...i know; and i use every power tool imaginable.it only takes a few minutes to inflate the flabbiest tire, this i know. do stay with it to avoid overinflaition. the psi dial is rock solid in indicating thecorrect amount of pressure. i've heard some of these gages are unreliable and jump around...not mine! keep it in your car in case you get a nail in your tire..it has the set-up to attach to your car's electric system. and do completely charge the battery before use or you may ruin a fine little tool. read those instructions!"
4,Suspenceful,Not to sound cliche but it really was better than the movie. Despite having a degree in Psychology I went back and forth on the main characters perspective for legitimacy. At the very least the book is engaging.
2,disappointed,"The bandanna is a jumbo bandanna, but VERY cheap material - not poly cotton. Printing is only on one side. I paid about 15 dollars for this with shipping and i feel let down. The bandannas at Walmart that sell for a fraction of the price are of much better quality. This bandanna is large - that is about the only positive aspect of it. I was expecting a nice soft bandanna similar to the my old favorite that i had. I don't even know if i will ever wear this."
5,Great Book,Saw this book at the airport in New Orleans two days after eating at The Palace. Recipes are true to food in restaurant.
5,Conscious Danchall Music,"Warrior King is a brilliant writer, singer, and performer. I saw him in Long Beach and in San Diego this year at the Bob Marley Festivals and he lit the stage on fire. His songs offer no slackness, and are so true to the essence of roots and culture music. I highly recommend this album to any one, without hesitation."
4,For Those Quiet Nights in Front of the Tree,"The Jazz At the Movies Band put out a series of well received discs throughout the 1990's. This is one of their best, a warm and mellow set of cinematic holiday songs that's perfect for winding down after a hectic day of Christmas shopping. Even non-fans of jazz should enjoy it.The musicianship on hand is first class, thanks to a stellar group that includes Bill Cunliffe, former Rippingtons keyboardist Mark Portmann, Bobby Shew, and the great Nino Tempo. The song list features familiar classics, like White Christmas from Holiday Inn, and some not-so-familiar songs, such as the theme from Santa Claus: The Movie. Every track is as soft and comfy as your parents' couch or a favorite pair of slippers.Although the CD stays in the same groove from beginning to end, it's a fine groove that will herald in the season with style."
3,Teaches New Words,"Good Product, I purchased it to expand my vocabulary, and it has done that. I am very please with my order."
4,College Caveman,"I Love this movie. It's nothing special but it came from Universal which means it's a cut above AIP and nicely photographed. It's really all about atmosphere and it has a nostalgic 50's look about it. I can't add much to what others have written except to say that Leading Lady Joanna Moore is the mother of Ryan and Tatum O'Neill. You seldom get to see her in a major role. My favorite scene is when Miss Moore runs her 1958 Desoto Fireflite convertible off the road to avoid the rampaging caveman. Thrilling stuff for a teenager in 1959! By the way, Molly Riordan's car is a 1958 Plymouth Belvedere convertible. Just thought some of you misght be curious."
3,STRANGE BUT TRUE,Intresting successor to THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON fron the same director Jack Arnold. Good make-up effects by Bud Westmore but a dumb plot that won't keep you interested for a minute. See the CREATURE trilogy and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE first.
3,50's Shlock at it's most average.,"I remembered this film from when I was a kid in the 60's. To see it again for the first time in about 40 years was a real treat. It took me about 4 nights to watch it as my attention span is now of the 21st Century variety.You can't take these movies seriously. The plot is still just silly.A college professor turns into a prehistoric man after accidently injesting the blood of a huge prehistoric carp.The actors all pretty good considering the time and subject matter. I was glad to notice Troy Donahue in an early part. They skimped on the transformation of Aurthur Franz turning into the caveman. Not quite up to Universal Studios of the 1940's and Wolfman.Still since it was probably made for Drive-In teenage audiences of 1959, It's still a fun movie. A guilty pleasure. Fun for all."
3,Pentecost provides great insight into the Life of Christ.,"This is a great book for those who wish to gain a greater understanding into the life of Jesus Christ. In particular, His offering of the Kingdom to the nation Israel and the ultimate rejection of that offer.The index at the back provides easy reference for most if not all of the many parables and allegories in the four Gospels as well as much other information. Very exhaustive!"
1,Tights not Knee-HIghs,"The web page for this item calls them Foot Traffic's Paris Lace Knee High Length Fashion Trouser Socks. But they send me tights instead, and when I contacted them about the mistake, they never responded. Anyone can make a mistake, but not to respond is rude and says they couldn't care less about customer satisfaction. DON'T BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!"
5,Jazzy Foot Wear,I purchased these trouser socks to wear to Christmas parties. They fit nicely and look great. I've even put them through the washer and dryer twice now and they are still in great shape. I highly recommend these. I also bought 4 more pair to give as gifts to my friends.
3,Ethereal. If you like Enya...then Caroline is one to check,"I like it. I'm not as blown away about it as I thought I would be. Moorlough is a great song. It's good, and she's very ethereal.-Jules Cohen (from - Jules Cohen & Whatever)"
5,Can't improve on perfection.,"Honestly, I've owned this album for YEARS, and I still listen to it on a daily basis. Caroline's voice is simply the most intimate and sensual that I've heard. Lyrically, this artist knows what she's doing--smart and emotive words are tied together to create great images. Musically, it is hard to beat ""Spirit."" It is a wonderful mix of traditional, ambient, and electronic. I've not read one review of this album by any music critic that has NOT been positive. The great news is that Caroline will be releasing a new album this year (FINALLY!!!) and is working on a second album for release at the end of 2001 that will be more classical (but still include her voice) and based on WWII poetry. How cool is this woman!?! Check out her official website at http://www.carolinelavelle.co.uk/ Seriously, no person should be without this CD."
3,Pleasant laidback album,"I got this album rather early in 2001, but it didn't really catch my fancy until 2002. Sometimes albums are like that--you don't like them so much when you first listen to them, but then they grow on you.This is laid back summer music all the way; I only listen to this in summer. It uses electric guitars with a lazy summer day sound, and features reflective male vocals."
2,Not for my big pup,"*I bought this at a store, not Amazon, this is a review for the product only, not the seller.*This product did not work for my girl. She is a 50 pound terrier mix that I have litter trained since we live in an apartment. My initial training was in kitty litter with the fake grass on top (homemade potty patch, since she's a bigger girl). I saw the doggie litter and decided to give it a shot.The first think I noticed was the price, twice the price of kitty litter.Second was the fact that my girl hated stepping on this stuff... She was fully litter trained, but because of the feel and the noise it made when she stepped in, it actually set us back. :(The worst thing for us though, even though I cleaned it every evening when I got home from work, it still smelled terribly bad! Like a hamster cage that hadn't been cleaned; since there are no order absorbers in this and it does not clump.It may work for smaller dogs, but we will be sticking to the kitty version."
4,Love the Doggie Litter System!,"During the frigid winter, we brought home two toy fox terrier/pug mixes, and this has helped out immensely! At 1.4 pounds, they were to small to go outside to go potty, so they could go in the litter pan anytime they had to go. We had very little difficulty in teaching the dogs where to go. It is ideal for us, because we work longs shifts and are not home on some days for 10+ hours. Great for those who just moved, or are about to move to new construction home sites--it keeps the dogs out of the mud and dirt! The dogs do tend to eat the litter, but it is not harmful, and their stool is not difficult to pass when they have digested it. And, as the dogs have grown, we have gotten progressively bigger with the size of the litter pan. I would not recommend this for a larger size dog!"
1,To expensive,"I trained my chihuahua to a litter box when we got her at 10 weeks, she was 1 pound and at 6 months is only 2 pounds. I do not like that this is a paper product, paper does not break down as well as wood pellets.I used wood pellets, I get 40 pounds for 5.00 and it last me 5 months. When Foxy poos I clean that right out. the pee soaks right away into the wood pellets. (get wood pellets at the hardware or safeway for pellet burning stoves)..So it never goes to the bottom. I put in 2 inches. There is absolutely NO order and I change it out about every 2 weeks.But training a dog to use a litter pan is extremely easy!!!"
3,Dogs are not interested,"This product does absorb all the smell but it also makes my dog lose interest, they wont pee/poo in it even when I put it where my dogs go potty, in fact they poo AROUND it."
4,The original is still the best!,"I could go on about how this film is the basis for ""Res Dogs"", but its mentioned so often, it'd be a waste of time, when you should be watching this excellent peice of Hong Kong cinema.Directed by Ringo Lam (""Twin Dragons"" with Jackie Chan) and featuring the world's coolest actor, Chow Yun Fat, this film is an exercise in tension, image, and style.You know the plot if you've seen that *other* film, but for those curious few who haven't seen it, Chow plays a young cop who works outside the norm on the Kowloon police force. Asked to do one last job,Chow infiltrates a gang of jewel thieves, led by Danny Lee. Lee, who you purists know as the detective in ""The Killer"", shines in his performance.While its a feast for the eyes, this one can sometimes stall from too many plotlines being examined at once. Hence, the four stars. Still, watch this enough times, and you can start a career for yourself in Hollywood too...."
4,The movie that made Tarantino... says James from London,"If you're new to Hong Kong movies, this is as good a story to begin your collection with. The action is brutally realistic, as in all Ringo Lams' movies, but still manages to support a gripping storyline. Hong Kong movies DARE to tread where Hollywood movies do not. Buy this, then buy Hard Boiled, Bullet in the Head, the Killer... what the hell, BUY THEM ALL!"
3,resource,a good resource but it takes time to get used to how the book is set-up. I keep it at work and several of the nurses on the floor use it
2,Waterproof good-- workouts okay,"The workouts are nothing special, but it is nice to have a book you can have at the pool. It adds variety, but did not make me a faster swimmer."
3,reel deal slots of fun,"Adequate slot games. I particularly like the max play of 45 coin games. The other games were boring. If I hit that seldom in Vegas I'd go home. It's better than alot of the slot sofeware, but it still needs some work on the imagination."
1,Games are flawed,I puchased 3 packs and none of them work properly. In the middle of a game it will just go off and you lose all the stats.The poker diskettes cursor has a mind of it's own. It also will pay a losing player and go off in the middle of the game.I think I deserve a replacement for all of the ones I bought. None of them work correctly.
2,"Good materials, poor design.","first, the good points. This is a nice looking knife that comes with a sharp factory edge. It looks well made, and feels good; that is, until you try to use it.It's hard to describe the proper method of using a chef's knife without visuals, but to be able to cut properly, the knife should be curved throughout the length of the edge, so it can smoothly rock on the cutting surface. This knife is curved at the tip, and then is flat along the main body, so instead of a fast, smooth rocking motion, you get a ""clunk"" as the flat part hits the cutting board. Some people may be able to use this tool happily, but an experienced slicer and dicer will be very disappointed. I cannot recommend this knife to any serious chef."
1,don't buy this item,"I rated this item once before because the first time that i wore it within 1/2 an hour the gold circle was gone -- not sodered on i would imagine. The company was nice enough to invite me to send it back to them (not worth the effort for me to walk over to the post office, pack it, etc.) so I just declined their great invite to exchange it. Anyway, i kept the bracelet on and believe it or not it turned blackish after about one week...anyway it is obviously junk. Please do not buy it - or you will be sorry as i am...junky silver..."
3,Basic Technical Detail is very thorough,"This book is very useful. Especially if you are technically minded and trying to move from another field such as IP Routing, Frame Relay or Wireless. It is technical where it needs to be a simple where it needs to be. It contains good, unhyped information. Its unbiased, point of view is refreshing in this time, when the networking books are mainly by manufacturers and full of hype."
5,No problems that I can see,"I bought this wrap at a discount because it was listed as irregular. I haven't noted any problems with the garment, so I am very happy with my purchase. I will likely use the wrap over a bathing suit or at home in the summer. The color is a deep, rich purple. The seller shipped everything quickly too."
4,"""We have a guest on board.""","Terrorists seize a cargo plane carrying two stealth bombers and it's up to Andrew Divoff to stop them. A nicely done ""Die Hard"" clone ( it's better than Passenger 57 ) and a good reason why Trimark Pictures should branch out of the straight-to-video market. Only complaint; they blow too many holes in the plane."
3,Low-budget air force drama,"This film is a low-budget military thriller, with a plot about terrorists attempting to steal stealth aircraft. As is always the case with air force dramas, the best element is visual, with some nice aerial combat scenes. The battle inside the cargo plane, as a small number of officers try to thwart the theft, is also quite suspenseful. The pacing is good, although the acting is admittedly mediocre. This film is nowhere near in the same league as Executive Decision or Top Gun, from which it borrows substantially. But it is concise and entertaining."
1,One Important Detail That Isn't In The Description,"...is that the unit is electric. I had assumed it was battery powered and haven't been able to use it since there's no outlet near the litter box. I still have it though - once I factor in the vendor's restocking fee on returns (15%) and the cost of postage and packing materials, the $4 or $5 I'd get back wasn't worth the hassle. I'll either give it away or find some use for it in the future..."
3,Loud motor after a few months,"I've owned two of these and I'm disappointed that they don't last very long. They really do help with odor control and the motor is nice and quiet at first. But after a few months, the motor starts making a loud buzzing/humming. I've cleaned the filters and used the can of air to blow any dust out of it. It didn't seem to help, so I bought the second one (thinking the first one was on it's way out). But the second one had the same problem. If the noise doesn't bother you, or the box is in a secluded area, I would recommend the fan because it does keep the odor down."
3,LitterMaid Better Than Nothing,"I was lucky. I was able to buy the LitterMaid during a special promotion. I got two for the price of one. It works better than nothing but I'd not pay almost $25 plus shipping for it. My first one lasted maybe 1 1/2 months before the motor gave out. I'm on the second one now and I've been noticing lately, it's starting to make noises like the first one. Of course that's okay if you have your litter box where you can't hear it run but with one of mine, it was close enough to our kitchen you could hear it. But it does work when it's working."
5,Tito Puente is El Presidente of Latin jazz !!,"You simply must listen to ""Hong Kong Mambo"", a lively and dance-worthy tune which is guaranteed to put a smile on your feet. And the song titled ""Aqui"" is just as infectious a tune, but with some hilarious Spanglish lyrics which may surprise you as well. This 2-disc set is light-hearted latin jazz dance music, not hard bop-oriented. Viva Puerto Rico Libre !"
2,Hope shovel was for only moving Snake?,"I hope the one reviewer meant to get out the shovel to relocate the snake to a different area and not kill the animal. Snakes are very effective at rodent control and rodents are FAR more likely to cause human health problems than snakes. Can you say ""hantavirus? Fatal to humans, spread by rodents. Or maybe you like mouse poop in your bread bin? Please do not kill snakes!!!"
4,Great bike,"I love this bike. Great price, sturdy and simply just works. The only thing that could make it better would be if you could program in your target heart rate zone and if it would alert you if you went outside that zone. Other than that this is a great buy for the money."
5,"outstanding craftsmanship, product pride","One of the most well-built, thoroughly engineered small bikes ever. Machining and design are so precise that parts practically fall into place by themselves on assembly. I have arthritis in the hands and the only very minor sticky spot was in placing small wires correctly and safely. The only negative review I've seen was from a woman who couldn't find the left peddle on assembly. Look in all the little niches in the styrofoam packing - it's a bit obscure for no apparent reason - a bit of imperfection in an otherwise exemplary product. Performs as advertised too. I love my new bike."
4,DeVille Dark,"This must be the darkest work from Willy. Missing is the brilliance of ""Lily's daddy's cadilac"" or the humor of ""Italian Shoes"". However, I have wondered if the celtic Borsey would surface (yes) and how he would integrate with the beloved castanets and brass work. Here it is, and beautifully done, although lyrics portray some desperate heartache/pain relief gone over the top. We are so relieved to hear him working and, dare I say, cheerful(?)of late."
2,Disappointing,I'm still trying to find a cd with that voice from The Princess Bride soundtrack. Did he sing that wonderfully just on one song?
1,Poetry?,"The idea behind this book is nice. Good to see people making an effort to help out in a charitable way post s11. As far as the poetry goes though, there is alot to be desired. I don't know if this is the first time the author has written any poems but as far as poems go they are absolutely terrible. It reads like badly written pros split up into a verse like presentation with no flowing language. I don't know if this could actually be classed as poetry! If you want this book for the sake of reading poetry then your money is better spent else where."
2,Just only for Beginner,"This book is useless for me, maybe I misunderstood the title or the introduction. I agree that the book can teach people to BEGIN bridge playing very well, but for me, an intermediate player, the contents on this book are all I had known.I had once thought this book could teach a player to play bridge with the fundamental logic, to find the key point on every hand. But after reading this book, I found this was not what I expected. All contents are BASIC. All I had read from other bridge books.Maybe someone could learn something form this book, but not me."
