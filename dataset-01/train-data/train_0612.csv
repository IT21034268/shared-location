3,Moving Pictures - Deluxe Edition [CD + DVD-Audio],"I am having DVD-Audio playback problems on my new Pioneer DV610 using the HDMI output. All my other DVD-A and SACDs play OK. Of interest, the RUSH ""Moving Pictures"" DVD-A plays correctly on my older analog only Pioneer DV578 via 5.1 RCA outputs. I may exchange the DVD-audio for the Blu-ray version. 3 stars because it plays on my older Pioneer."
4,Stick to bubble-gum Pop,"The official Amazon reviewer makes it quite plain why people who think Britney Spears and the like good music should not be asked to comment on real music. She shows little understanding of progressive rock, and should refrain from displaying her ignorance. Maybe elsewhere she can complain of Beethoven's self-indulgence.I am not a big fan of Rush, but I will say that I believe this to be one of their best. A good album of really good music, but nothing to dance to."
4,Rush on their way to progressive rock genius!,"Please not I am not under 13, and in fact am a person substantially older and literate in the English language, but do not feel the need to give my name.----------------------------------------------------------------Rush's follow up to their commercial flop ""Caress of Steal"" was 2112. The first track (and first side on vinyl) was a story about an anonymous man in the year 2112 when the Priests of the Temple of Syrinx rule all aspects of people's lives, and this plot is rumored to parallel Rush and their label after ""Caress of Steal."" The tracks after that are all top-notch, with the exception of ""Tears,"" which is a least favorite of mine. I find it to be too much of a ballad and not what we love Rush for. The song is not bad, just not as excellent as all the others. I highly recommend this album to any Rush fan."
5,A true classic,"I've loved this album from beginning to end for the better part of my existence. It is the last ""raw"" rock album Rush put out before they started getting heavy into elctronica. If you really want to hear what Neil, Geddy, and Alex can do, this is a wonderful place to start. Unlike most of the people who have rated this album, my favorite tune is ""Camera Eye"", it's a kick-ass 8 minute joy to listen to and extremely fun to play (I'm a bass player). You'll love this album. Oops! I mean CD."
5,Classic,The new era of Rush music. This album is a big favourite with fans and contains a healthy dose of synthesizers. I know fans are divided on the synth issue but I really feel on Moving Pictures the mix is spot on. Rush have always experimented with sound but have maintained contemporary musical sensitivities to produce music that challenges the listener. This album is a classic and well worth a purchase!
5,great Album,"This is a truly classic albums of Rush's. If you don't have it, buy it. This album brings back a lot of great memories from the Awesome 80's, if you weren't old enough in the 80's to enjoy the 80's, I feel sorry for you. It was awesome and Rush and all their albums were most certainly a part of it. My favorite song on this album is Red Barchetta. Death metal is great too, and Rush lead the way for all great rock music, rather it be death metal or heavy metal!Thank you"
5,I LOVE IT!,"I am a huge Rush fan. And I LOVE THIS CD!!!!!! I bought it for one reason...YYZ. And I love the whole thing. It's amazing. Those 3 guys really know how to put out good material. Also, I reccomend the triple-disc live CD. A MUST HAVE!"
5,grider67,"When I was in middle school, I noticed a buddy of mine was wearing a ""Moving Pictures"" concert shirt. I asked him who was this band called Rush (This was in the 70's folks). He let me borrow his album and I listened to it. It blew me away. Neal on the drums, Getty on the bass and synthesizer, and Alex on the lead guitar. They were living the ""Limelight"". Now in the year 2001, I can honestly tell you, I've owned one album, 3 cassettes, and now one CD of ""Moving Pictures"". I can honestly say that this is a must and will forever be in my collection."
5,Living in the Limelight,"Moving Pictures marks a significant time in the history of Rush. Following 1980's Permanet Waves, which is kind of like a prequel, Rush came full circle by eliminating the sonic grooves they had worked into their progressive rock sound while shifting their focus to playing rock music with a much harder edge. Moving Pictures is symbolic as it reflects a redefining period when progressive rock groups were playing harder and heavier again and just before synthesizers would forever change how the music sounded. This album could also easily pass for a greatest hits collection as some of the best classics are here, plus there's ""Camera Eye,"" the band's last ever epic song. Moving Pictures lies right in the middle of the band's progression and helped catapult their popularity to the masses, but the songs remain inviting, insightful, and truly timeless even 26 years after it's release. They may be older now, but when you define them by their craft they remain ageless."
5,Timeless....,"Do you have that one cd that you will always consider to be your all time favorite? The one where you can play from start to finish and each track takes you on a journey or to another place? For me it will always be this release. I feel that the overall sound on this album is probably why it has treanscended for so many years. As I have gotten older I find myself appreciating production and the mix of an album more so than in my younger days. On a really great system, these songs will go right through you. Check out Neil Peart's drum sound on this album...so tight and clean and not exactly replicated again on any other release. I would next have to say that LIMELIGHT for me, is probably THE quintessential Rush song. Opinions are sure to vary, but one can't deny the impact that this album has had musically, commercially and historically."
5,Excellent,"This is rush's best album.It is a perfect balance of progressive tunes and rockers.Red Barchetta takes you on a wild ride,YYZ is there greatest instrumetal 2nd only to La Villa Strangito.Tom Sawyer and Limelight are awesome.Camera Eye is a great epic.And Witch Hunt is the first and best part of the 3 part epic Fear.Signals was a great follow up to this but sadly rush wouldn't relive this album till 91's Roll The Bones"
2,"Great Music, Awful Remaster","What a let-down. The best Rush album in pristine 96khz 24bit resolution could have and SHOULD have been epic. Not so. It's compressed, loud, and harsh in the high end. Hold on to your vinyl copies or try the Mobile Fidelity gold disc version of this classic. It's still the best digital alternative if you can find it. I'm giving this review a two-star for effort. Hopefully we'll see more music in blu-ray high rez-- and done ""right"" for a change."
2,"Confusing, decent sound but could be a lot better",Sounds pretty good but they didn't do the titling/buttoning right... you hit dolby 5.1 and it's like you hit nothing. Has 4 or so videos that seem to be 5.1 - the audio portion I have a hard time telling if it's that or just fancy surround. Could be much better in my opinion with a little more clarity on the procedural stuff and perhaps better mixing.
5,"Rush, ""Moving Pictures"", 1981","A classic progressive rock album. This has too be one of the greatest rock albums made of all time defenentally in the top 100 greatest albums of all time. Everything on here sounds great the drums vocals etc. Rush was becoming a big band around this time Rush was becoming a pretty big band and Moving Pictures made them huge. It has sold millions and millions of copies around the world.Some of Rush's greatest songs are on this album, Tom Sawyer, YYZ, Limelight, and many other great songs. To date Rush still plays some of the songs on this album live. This album is just perfect in every single way. Plus the price on here is too beat only 7.97 that is a great deal. All in all if you like rock music you should buy this album of Rush and these other two albums, 2112, Farewell To Kings."
4,Great record! One of my faves,"Moving Pictures by Rush is a wonderful album; it is a staple of most Prog Rock collections. Of course the vinyl is old so there were a couple of scratches on the record, but the quality and sound were otherwise good. The sleeve was a little worn (as to be expected) but wasn't falling apart like some records I come across."
3,"very gertrude stein, but more readable","i usually find stein's play with words a bit frustrating. however, this is a more readable book, one of her most accessible works. insightful in its view of fame & narcissism in america."
5,"Often overlooked, but never equaled!","Set during the Maori Wars in New Zealand, this movie is a powerful examination of the damage revenge does. Nothing is cut and dried, and it demands a lot from viewers, but in the end it rewards with a new perception about the difference between justice and vengence. See it, if for no other reason than it is one of the most beautifully shot films I've ever seen."
4,"""The Spirits Of My People Command Me, I Must Kill The White Man For What He Has Done""","Note: This DVD cannot be viewed in the America's without a multi-region player.Based on a true account of the Maori uprising of 1870, 'Utu' posits the often asked and all important question ""Who are the savages amongst us?"" In this particular case is it the native Maori of New Zealand who dared defy British occupation and rule, or was it English arrogance and total lack of concern for the native culture that brought about the eventual end of British Colonialism in the area?Brutal, violent, uncompromising, yet at the same time it contains moments of unexpected humor. Another great film in a long line of movies to come out of Australia and New Zealand. Unforgetable performances by Anzac Wallace as the rebellious Te Wheke and Bruno Lawrence as the white settler obsessed with avenging his wife's death.Some lessons are never learned. Savages come in all forms, colors and disguises."
3,"As usual, Maltin misses the mark","Leonard Maltin's characterizing this film as ""dull"" leads me to question whether he's actually seen it. In fact, it's a remarkable piece of work with powerful performances. ""Sometimes I'm mad ... sometimes I'm not!"""
1,Somewhat disappointing.,I was disappointed with the end result in that I could so absolutely NO difference whether I used this or not.
1,Fatal Flaw,"The product description twice mentions the ""doctor recommended"" program of walking 10,000 steps per day, which is why I bought this watch/pedometer. But it doesn't accumulate your steps throughout the day. If you sit down for 30 minutes, the pedometer goes into sleep mode and you have to re-start it to continue counting. If you forget after driving or working at your computer, you miss the steps you take, which pretty much blows your program. All the watches in the Accelerator line are virtually identical. They're just packaged differently. Furthermore, if that flaw doesn't bother you, the directions for this watch are impossible to understand. I had to call customer service three times and even they had to ask for help to figure it out. They faxed me a simplified set of directions, but that was only slightly more help."
4,great gift for moms,"my wife has used this watch now for a month AND ABOUT 70 MILES. i got it for her (or i should say our children got it for her) on mother's day. we set out immediately to use it on our walks. after making adjustments with it a few times and setting up the correct sensitivity(hers is 3)it works every time within the written 5% accuracy. in fact we once used it and found that it was about 10% off and thought it was broken, but after rolling up her sweatshirt sleeve, we found it to be within the 5% again. i am not sure whether it times out or not quite frankly since we use it for long walks ..but it is great for someone who wants to know how much they are walking on a daily basis INSIDE AND OUT. i use a gps unit and she has regularly been about 2-3% off ...BUT I CANNOT USE MINE INSIDE WHICH I THINK GIVES THIS AN EDGE : AS WELL THE COST IS GREAT!!"
3,Can not see the distance and Excercise Time at the same time,I used it for hiking.PROS:- Measures distance pretty acuratelyCONS:- Can not see the distance and Excercise Time at the same time- The watch face scratches very easily
3,Exercise Enthusiast With So Little Time,"I would have rated the product 5 stars as far as quality, but the reviews that I read berfore ordering were correct - the instructions were complex for setting up the device. As one comfortable with computers and am not intimadated by things such as this I took a chance. I could have figured the instructions out if I had enough time, but it just was not worth it to me - I would rather be out walking or hiking than trying to figure it out so I returned it."
2,Accelerator Women's Hiker Watch,"Attractive. Lightweight. Multiple functions.Too bad I couldn't figure them out. Which mode to push,when, how many seconds, etc. etc. etc.IF you want something quick and easy, this is not the product.As it stands now, I am not using it. I'll stick with those cheaper models.A higher I.Q. than mine is required here!"
3,Nice but Confusing product,The watch looked nice but it is very confusing to figure out how to set it up in order for it to calculate the distance traveled.
4,Can't believe it works this well!,"Excellent alternative to more expensive GPS's and old-fashioned 'clickety-clack' pedometers. I can vouch for the 95% accuracy. I don't like the auto-resetting function of the pedometer but maybe I just haven't figured out how to use it properly. I do like how it records data by date. Prior to use, you do need some patience and a 9-yr old child to help teach and motivate you to figure out most functions. I would ask Tech4O to come up with a model that has a better crystal. Mine is pretty scratched up and I might pay $50 more for one that's more scratch-resistant."
2,techo watch,I like the watch OK but it is too complicated and takes too long to get going before I start to exercise. It needs to be simpler with less than 10 modes and easier just to start pedometer and calorie counter.
3,the church needs this,"Good message for those in the Body of Christ who demand an impossible level of the Ephesians 5 passage. The controlling and domineering husband/father in the story got it wrong and his wife participated in it. Nancy Rue wrote a solid story about how a tragedy challenges that family dynamic, but also offers hope for redemption when we miss the mark. The emotions were vividly expressive, even if the main character ""sounded"" a little hokey in some places. I enjoy this author and even more so in her partnership with Stephen Arterburn."
1,product shipped is not product shown,what comes in the mail is a 1.2oz bottle of concentrate. you have to mix it with a quart of distilled water and put it into your own spray bottle. misleading (at the very least) advertising.
4,IT LIGHTS UP,It would be great if you were looking for a hat that flashes Redskins colors. We bought it be mistake.
3,not what i expected,only had the hat two weeks and it no longer lights up so i guess your batteries no good haven't had money to buy new ones to see if it even still works that way
1,HORRIBLE VACUUM,"I purchased this vacuum because I have mostly hardwood floors and thought the power nozzle would work better than a floor brush. Was I wrong!!! The nozzle has no suction without the rug power on and that only pushes the dust and particles to another spot. The tiny floor attachment is what I end up using and it takes me twice as long to vacuum. Also, the attachment holder which doesn't keep the atttachemnets in place, keeps you from getting under beds and tight areas, the reason I prefer a canister. I think it is also cheaply made machine. The first time I changed the bag the clip broke. There is also an irritating high pitched screach the vacuum makes that makes this a horrible little machine. I wish I had researched this a little better and perhaps seen it in person before I purchased it. I don't recommend this to anyone!!"
1,It literaly smells,"I would not recommend this vacuum and would not recommend Hoover as a company with whom to do business. We have had this vacuum cleaner for just over one year, but from day one, it has smelled like someone sprayed it with DDT. We were hoping that after a while the smell would dissipate, but no such luck. One year later, the smell permeates throughout the closet where we keep it and throughout the room when it is used to vacuum. Today we finally called Hoover. They were not interested in knowing anything about the source of the odor nor why, one year later, did it still reek of this awful smell. They absolved themselves of any responsibility because the year warranty was up. Besides all this, the vacuum cleaner is subpar for performance. The attachments are useless and it is heavy and clumsy to move about."
5,Great Vacuum,I received this for my wedding and I love it. In my apartment I have hardwood floors and carpet. This canister vacuum is a wonderful multi surface cleaner and the vacuum bag is pretty good size. To vacuum the carpet all you do is flip a switch on the handle and switch the floor height to carpet and the brush drops down giving you a clean carpet. Another feature is that you are able to adjust the speed of the motor. I highly recommend this product.
1,Badly designed hose connection,"The accessories that come with this vacuum are a joke. I bought a standard size brush head and found it does not fit the end of the hose which is an oddball size. Hoover doesn't make an adapter and I haven't found one elsewhere, either. Otherwise, the power is decent and it is light and compact."
1,Do Not Buy This Vacuum,"Do yourself a favor and pick out another vacuum to buy. This thing may be the worst home purchase i have made to date. Why would a vaccum have an adujustable power knob? Isn't the purpose to pick up as much crap off the floor as possible? Even at full power, the suction on this thing is a joke, any attachment falls to the floor & i feel like breaking the machine into 100 pieces everytime i am forced to use it."
3,duros vac,"Was excited about this purchase...until I started using it. It's great for the attachments (for edges, etc.), but not as good on the main part of the carpet. Disappointed. Wishing I would have spent my money on another windtunnel vac."
3,impossible to find bags,"This is an average vacuum at a decent price. But it is impossible to find replacement bags. I wish I'd bought a different machine, as I can't use this one at all now, until bags become available."
2,Hose breaks easily,We've had it for 3 years but only use it occasionally to clean the one small carpeted room in our house. The hose tore at the connection to the wand and the power wires that run through the hose came out of the attachment so now the whole thing is worthless.
1,"Don't waste your money on this ""Hoover""","My first comment is that I have owned many Hoovers in the past, anddon't have an axe to grind with the brand.Is the Duros really made or designed by hoover?What a horrible plastic wand, and power head connector.I have had all three wand connections break over the last two years.To keep it working I've had to duct tape them. The final center connectionbroke yesterday, and now no power to the head.HORRIBLE construction and/or poor plastic selection by the manufacturer.This plastic is way too brittle for vacuum cleaner wands.The pros:Great suctionBrush really picks up pet hairNo real dust from exhaustI would not buy this again, nor recommend it to ANYONE unless Hooverredesigns the wand."
2,bad bag makes a good machine bad,"this machine is powerful and i like the attachments. --- i have owned it for about 3 years and the bagging is just awful -- it is a poor fit and does not hold in place creating an awful mess and shutting down the effectiveness of the machine --- i do not recommend this product ------ should the bagging problem be correncted, I would give a very different review."
4,VAC,"ITS A VACUUM, I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY 20 DOLLARS MORE THAN THE PART I NEEDED FOR MY OTHER ONE- NOW I HAVE A NEW VAC AND PLENTY OF PARTS FOR IT- REALLY SUCKS- IT'LL SUCK THE FACE RIGHT OFF YER SKULL."
1,THE worst vacuum that I have ever had.,"I got this vacuum as a gift. It worked for about a year then the hose began to separate ... yes thank goodness for duct tape. Even went as far as to looking into getting a replacement hose, but it would've cost me close to $90.Since I no longer could return it and after another year of suffering with this cleaner, I bought a Roomba. I'm hoping that it is much more reliable than the Duros."
2,Lackluster performance,"I purchased this as I had another Hoover cannister albeit a more expensive one that was an excellent machine. I cannot say the same about the Duros. It appears to have reasonable suction with the crevice tool and/or the step tool but it does not do a good job on carpets. I'm not sure why. I suspect the ""powered"" head is just poorly and/or cheaply designed. I usually end up using my older upright vaccum when I really want to clean my carpets. The Duros just isn't up to the task. It appears that $250 or $300 is needed to purchase a decent Hoover cannister."
4,Very Pleased,"After using bagless vacuums for several years, I decided to go back to the bag type. This is also my first canister vacuum cleaner. I am very pleased with the performance, power, and even looks of the machine.I will indeed use Amazon again to locate items in need."
4,Can't beat the price.,"Works better on hardwood than carpet. I bought this as a basement-only workbench vacuum cleaner. It doesn't come close to my electrolux. But, that's to be expected - my electrolux costs 5 times more. This is an excellent choice for a secondary vacuum. Cheap, compact, comes with many attachments. The 'bag full' indicator is handy."
4,Good vacuum,"This vacuum is not as compact as I've expected, and it's little bit too heavy to carry around. However, the suction of this vacuum is pretty powerful, and it's fairly easy to take it apart."
3,Mediocre after a year's use,"This vacuum is great when it is new - powerful suction and great flexibility, switching easily from wood floors, tile and carpet. The tool storage on the handle is not very convenient, but that is not a deal breaker.My mother and I each bought a Duros canister vacuum 2 years ago. Her Duros died after one year, when the hose coupling broke and the repair shop told her not to bother fixing it. Mine is still working decently, (after my awesome husband, who likes to edit my reviews, did a complete tear-down looking for intermittent power loss only to replace the shorting wall plug) but the suction quality has declined appreciably and the noise has increased appreciably. It's just not as great anymore.For the price, it is isn't a bad purchase, but I would not buy this vacuum again."
4,Conventional Vacuum,"It was hard to locate a conventional canister vacuum at electronics and hardware stores with the evolution and popularity of filterless upright models. The Hoover canister vacuum is what can be expected from conventional technology. It is simple to use, works powerfully, and is just as reliable as any new reengineered product."
3,"It's Nice, I guess","It's a vacuum cleaner. The hand tools are awkwardly located and loose enough to fall off. Great suction, very light, and NO dust like most bagless canisters. Bags are common and available at any Best Buy and are available online. This is a good canister vacuum."
2,Poorly Designed Electrical fittings,I had one of these for several years - I bought it in 2000 or so. It worked great for a long time and in 2008 it broke down - the fittings loosened up so that it wouldn't stay together. I duct taped it to make it go as long as possible but finally bought another one in July 2008. This one lasted about 6 months! Same problem - seems there is a short of some kind. I pulled it apart (literally took it apart piece by piece to see if I could find the loose wire) and can't find a thing wrong with it other than the carpet brush won't rotate.I think it is just poor design on the electrical connections.
3,Good suction when the belt...,The suction works good when the belt stays on. A design flaw. Twice now in 3 months I've had to take apart the power nozzle and put the belt back on. A real pain. Also finding bags is difficult and expensive. Wish I spent a little more money and got a Miele.
3,Stuck!,"Hoover Duros Power Nozzle Canister Vacuum, Bagged, S3590I am unable to get the wand apart! It's stuck as if it were glued!"
4,"Very Good, but still not excellent","I researched a lot online and read many reviews trying to find the perfect cansiter. I needed something for carpets and hardwood floors, that would go under the bed all the way.This one does a gr8 job on carpet, couldn't wish for better, but does not do so well on floor. It did not pick up all the litter that was scattered from my cat's litter box!! I expected more there.One other problem, is the black rubber around the piece that does the carpet and floor has fell off from one side after using it for just 2 times!!! Def. expected more there. However, I'm not even considering returing it, coz of the unbelievable job it does on my carpet. Its heavy to push a little put still lighter than my last one. For its price.. i still like it very much. Amazing suction, my carpets are bare foot clean!!"
1,"Good, if you can find a bag for it.","Do not waste your time on the Hoover Duros. It is a nice machine but wait till you need to find replacement bags. Costco and Best Buy sell the machine but not the bags, not even on their web sites. Just try and find the SR replacement bags locally. Good luck. Even Hoover online does not sell them. What a joke."
1,Sounds Like a Jet Turbine,"Has no one else noticed that this thing is deafening? I don't care how well it may clean, I can't tolerate that horrible sound. It is by far the loudest and highest pitched vacuum I've ever used. It's going back this week."
1,THE worst vacuum I ever used!,"I bought this vacuum spur of the moment because it was on sale. BIG mistake. There are many issues with this piece of junk.First, this vacuum is LOUD. Yeah, I get most vacuums make a little vrrrm noise. ..But this one is so loud that I get a headache while vacuuming, and on top of it being completely and utterly loud, it's accompanied by a high pitched ringing sound.As far as performance goes, it does NOT even pick up 50%. I will go over the same area 20X and see the same little crumbs and whatnot on the floor..so I end up picking it up with my hands, bc this garbage vacuum isn't even capable of picking up larger crumbs, little fuzzies, or basically anything that is visible to the eye.If you are reading this and considering this vacuum.......You have been forewarned!!"
2,Not A Winner - Just A Loser !!,"Received this yesterday and today its on its way back for a refund. This vacuum is not ""hypoallergenic"". The bags supposedly are, but there is no physical connection between the hose and the bag. The hose connection has a rubber gasket that sits against the bag opening. This allowed dust and small debris to bypass the bag opening and end up in the vacuum cavity itself, anytime the canister cover flexes, and then back into the air.What the hell good is a hypoallergenic bag? This really sucks for asthmatics or persons with allergys. In my case its asthma. The vacuum, aside from what I just described is not engineered very well. The canister is heavy as hell, the hose is very thick rubber and not very flexible. It performs poorly on carpets and just okay on hardwood as the swiveling head is quite heavy and difficult to control and wanders all over the place. Not a good choice at all."
3,It's just an ok product,"This vacuum has good suction and adjustable ""motor torque"" control. The hose is way to short and quite bulky. The so called on board attachments are quite small and I do mean small!! To the point the look like they belong on a small vehicle vac. The attachment holder is supposed to mount on the wand but if you do that it makes it hard to go under things such as beds. It would just always get in the way. I put velcro on the wand and the attachment I use most and stuck it to the wand. I have berber carpet and it seems to do fair job of picking up."
2,Disappointed,"Bought this vac at a big box store about 6 months ago. I have always had uprights, but now have a house with wood floors. I was hoping this canister vacuum would do a better job on the bare floors, especially considering I have a shed-monster springer spaniel! I was wrong and I am disappointed. This Hoover is hard to use and feels like you are yanking a small stubborn animal all over the house. Every so often I have to stop, turn around to see what it's up to, and give it a pull. This is my first and last canister vacuum. I recommend spending more money and getting a quality upright."
3,Vacuum Cleaner Blues,"Complained long enough about problems dusting with my upright cleaner to convince my husband to get me a new canister cleaner, so excited, I am gong to have a sparkling house, but voila, the dust brush is doll house size! It definitely is not for speed dusting and the area of the brush is so small! and the bristles are stiff, doesn't look furniture friendly - oh for a big round brush with soft bristles, but when I tried to find out if another attachment is available got nowhere. The suction is great, easy to move about, only other drawback, a temporary one, is that you have to search for the controls, black on black, ok after you learn them."
4,Works,"Works pretty well. I generally prefer a heavier end attachment, so it gets down into carpet more and no moving bits to tangle up, but so far this hasn't snarled in the mass of long hair, thread, and cat hair that it deals with. Granted, I haven't been using it for terribly long, but it seems to work well. Suction is good, it's not overly loud, and reasonably lightweight. Replacing bags is easy too."
1,Thumbs Down on Hoover Duros,"I have had this vacuum for 2 years and I hate it. It is heavy, cumbersome, always tips over. A pain to change the bag the attchments etc. I do not mind vacuuming but this machine makes me miserable. I am in search of a better vacuum and cant wait to get rid of this one. My next one will not be a Hoover based on my experience!"
4,Solid Work,"My older sister had many boyfriends and they came and went. I don't remember most of them, except the guy who gave me Caress of Steel for my birthday! What a present! I was starting to learn bass guitar at the time and I was blown away. This album rocked! Excellent guitar work and solid song writing as well. The lyrics were sometimes weird, and there was a lack of cohesiveness, but who cares, great rock music can change the world!!! A definite recommendation."
5,Rush's Most Underrated Prog Effort.,"Caress Of Steel's mood is very dark and artsy, I can't even really explain it, but yes, it does sound underdeveloped compared to their later epic-featuring albums, but to me that's what makes this album great...and underrated. Songs like the heavy ""Bastille Day"", and ""I Think I'm Going Bald"", are excellent, I'm sorry, but I love the quirkiness of the latter track. The lyrics don't really bother me to much, because the music is more important and it rocks hard. To me ""The Fountain Of Lamneth"", is the high point of the cd. The lyrics may seem to others like their 'weak' or 'shallow', but once again fine, the music, at least on here is what should be looked at. The music on here to me is great featuring heavy rock, soothing classical guitar, and heavy rock again.Overall, this is a great and underrated cd and a great progressive rock album.Thanks."
4,. . . of Things to Come,"This album is very much a transitional piece. Many of the songs are a cross between their first two albums and the next three to come. The music, for the most part, is good, and the lyrics are improving on songs like Bastille Day and Lakeside Park as well as some excerpts on The Fountain of Lamneth. But it's these inconsistencies that don't give the album a flow and thereby leave as a forgotten piece. That said, it does contain some of Rush's most beautiful melodies.Highlights: The latter half of Lakeside Park is very pretty and contains a good line ""Though it's just a memory, some memories last forever."" Return of the Prince is very beautiful and contains a very tuneful Lifeson solo. The Fountains of Lamneth contains about 12 minutes of really good music mixed in throughout and is overall a very good song.Bottom Line: If you like the fantasy trilogy (2112, Kings, Hemispheres), get this album. If you prefer the more radio friendly early 80's period, then skip it."
3,I am not a Rush fan,"Well, this CD was recommended to me by a friend, as he claims that this is his favorite Rush CD. I thought it was interesting, and definately alot of work went into it. My favorite song is ""Going Bald"". A would definately recommend this one."
3,Give It A Second Look.,"While the weakest of the Rush albums, Caress of Steel has a way of growing on you. It has taken me over 15 years to really appreciate this album.This album features 2 ""concept"" songs. Once you get past the hit and miss ""singles"", you are in for a treat!The Necromancer is a journey into the fantasy mind of Neil Peart and features some great jam sessions and a good yet odd story.The Fountain of Lamneth is one song/suite that took me years to get into. It is one of the first long suites by Rush and it is very good. A lot of musical styles are heard through the entire song.Give Caress of Steel a chance. I did and I can't believe I let this album collect dust."
4,Sooooo close to being a perfect album...,"Rush's third effort, Caress of Steel, would prove to be a failure amongst the critics, but I find it to be a good album. The opening track, Bastille Day, is on of my favorite Rush songs and I never get tired of listening to it. I think I'm going Bald has somewhat cheesy lyrics but great music (kind of brings us back to the first album). Lakeside Park is another favorite of mine, but the album slides afer that fine track. The Necromancer is the first Rush composistion over ten minutes long and is well done, but 2112 would prove to be much better. The Fountain of Lametth is one of my least favorite of theirs and would definetly not get on a greatest hits CD if me or anyone else was creating it. While this was an ok effort, their next albim would blow people's minds away."
3,Window to Future Greatness,"I find it strange that people are giving this album 5 stars. That means it is as good as Moving Pictures? Hemispheres? Signals? Permanent Waves? These are considered Rush's finest albums and, by most opinions, far superior to COS. Anyhow this album is transitory in nature as Rush moved from straight ahead rock songs to their more conceptual material. While ""necromancer"" and Fountains"" have some superb sections they are nowhere near as cohesive or complex as future epic efforts (i.e., 2112, Hemispheres, Natural Science). If your not a hardcore fan this album will not interest you."
4,Rush's worst album? I hardly think so.,"This album is absolutely riveting. In a time of post-hippie love and peace offerings, Rush breaks the mold with ""Caress of Steel"". The best song on the album, in my opinion, would have to be ""No One at the Bridge"", part 3 of ""The Fountain of Lamneth"". The whole album is tight, from beginning to end. Even with semi-quirky songs such as ""I Think I'm Going Bald"", the Canadian trio kicks aside the norm and forges their own paths for others to follow.A must-have for any Rush fan, I give it 4 out of 5 stars."
5,Absolutely the best early RUSH album.,"Caress of Steel is without question the best early RUSH album. It displays their supreme artistry with the large-scale works of The Necromancer and The Fountain of Lamneth. Also their ability to play good old rock and roll with I Think I'm Going Bald. Already hinted at on the previous album, Fly By Night, Peart's lyrics and percussion both attain the poigniant mastery we know so well. A commercial flop, this album is an artistic tour de force."
4,excellent album but needs greater balance,"this album was created in a mood that they wished to define as that of storyteller, and with the revival of By-tor, the defeated villian in the second album, they wanted to relay themes which could not possibly be played on radio, due in large part to the length of the pieces, almost dooming them to commit to the creation of non airable songs, only ones which would be heard from the stereo turntables of the most hard core and die hard fans. Even so, this album, in it's own way, paved a path which would alter their style and progress from then on."
3,Not bad,"This isn't a bad release. Besides ""Bastille Day,"" it's not my thing though. I've listened to Caress of Steel just a handul of times. I admit being more of a 1980's fan. This isn't a favorite album of mine, but it's not bad."
2,Mainly for diehard Rush fans.,"And I would certainly include myself in that group, but of all of the band's recordings this is the one I would choose last if I was going through every Rush album. This album is to the early era what Test for Echo is to the current state of Rush affairs: neither is very good.Granted, ""Bastille Day"" and ""Lakeside Park"" are both quality songs, but that's about all there is here. ""I Think I'm Going Bald"" seems like a silly novelty song (in other words, not to be on a Rush album) and the two longer songs just seem to drag on forever with few rewards along the way. If you want every Rush album in your collection, and many of us do, then by all means add this one to it. Otherwise, you're not missing a lot if you just go on to 2112 which you absolutely must have."
5,cool,Caress of steel is a graet albem.The song the fountain of lamneth is my favorite song on their.Rush you are my favorite band.sometimes I go to your web site.My favorite guy in your group is Geddy Lee.when I grow up I want to be a singer like you guys.one day when I grow up I want to meet your band in concert and get your autograph.Oneday I want to get all of your cds.
3,"not terrible, but not that good","honestly, if you are the type of insane Rush fan that most people are, you will already have this. The best songs off this cd are on Chronicles, so a new fan doesn't need to get this cd. I would say that it is their second worst album, after Presto (see my review) but even then it really isn't that bad. It's not that the songs are bad, its just that they aren't particularly memorable, and they stumble a little too much (except Bastille Day, one of their best songs.) I find that 2112 (their next release) is overall more complete and rocks more, but if you like all the songs that you hear from this early period in Rush history, you should go ahead and get this album, their 3rd and least respected."
4,I finally get it,"I've been a Rush fan for 27 years and this was the one album that I always ignored, thinking that ""Bastille Day"" was the only good song. Just recently I started listening again and I discovered ""The Fountain of Lamenth"". I can't believe how long I've ignored this song, although presumably I had heard it before. Wow! Although my list of favorite Rush songs changes frequently, I now put ""Fountain"" in the top 5 along with ""Natural Science"", ""Cygnus X-1"", ""By Tor"", and ""La Villa""."
2,It is not their best!!,"Well, I have the ""BAstille Day"" version contained in ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE"", so I did not buy this album, because this song is the only worthwhile moment here...Geddy's voice was never more annoying than in this album. The two ""epic"" pieces are boring and unfocused. Of course we find a lot of great musicianship, after all we're talking about Geddy and Neil here! (Let me tell you a little secret: I Never liked PEart's lyrics. They are dumb, disconnected, they have no rhythm when Geddy sung them. The classic songs would be much better with other lyrics).Anyway, most of RUSH fans swallow anything they do. I do not."
1,YUCK,"Other than the first track, CARESS OF STEEL, this is a limp cd. Two over drawn out rock operas, and, besides Carress, not a decent stand alone song on this waste of money. This one a very few bad rush cds."
4,Prelude to a masterpiece,"Most people say it's under-rated, and forgotten. This is probably true as the album didn't really have a strong ""hit"",(Bastille Day and Lakeside Park are probably the only songs that ever got any airplay) it lacked the focus that most of their future CD's would have. It was kind of a concept album, dark and moody ""heavy metal"" - ish but not quite. Bastille Day captures the essence of the Rush sound in the early years, strong, melodic, loud and clever. Still, for me I have fond memories of listening to the Fountain of Lamneth and Necromancer in the early 80's as a young musician and being taken away to a strange and dark place with its haunting melodys and raw texture - a mix of acoustic guitars with a very agressive and hard sound. Over- all there is a lot of character in this transitional work, Rush was searching for something and in retrospect Caress is a prelude to the masterpiece that was coming, 2112."
5,One of the best Rush albuns,"Though this is a not famous album, even among Rush fans, this is one of the best. I think The Return of The Prince ( third part of The Necromancer ) is one of the most beaultiful pieces Rush has ever written."
5,Quite Possibly Their Best Album,"Although discounted by the record label, this record represents the shear intensity of these 3 incredible musicians even at the very young ages (they were) at that time. Listen to the Necromancer at about 4 minutes in......the 3+ minute guitar solo work of Alex Lifeson is beyond description. He gets less credit than Lee and Peart when it comes to shear talent yet when you listen to tracks like this you see how unfair those asessments really are. This guy belongs in the top 10 guitarist list of all time. This band is simply incredible. Pick up a copy of this little known album and listen to it from beginning to end. You'll be hooked. Then discover the first track on Hemispheres and you simply won't believe your ears. Rush is simply awe inspiring."
3,Rush's third album was a commercial flop,"The third album from Toronto based rock trio Rush was not well-accepted by their label Mercury Records, and received minimal airplay due to the fact that it contained two extended-length story pieces. The members of Rush considered this their best work to date. There are only 3 tracks on this disc that are not related in any way. This album showcased Rush's ability to set different moods with the music."
5,RUSH ROCKS,My husband is a Rush fanatic! He has all the music they ever made and listens to them on a daily basis! Geddy Lee`s voice is INCREDIBLE!!! We just saw them in concert this summer and their music hasn`t changed one bit!!! Rock On!!!
3,"Good attempt, but falls short in many ways","Clearly Rush bit off more than they could chew on their third album. This one is much more ambitious than ""Fly by Night"", but overall lacks the energy of their next album, the classic ""2112"". ""The Necromancer"" is a great song, but the other epic song on this album, ""The Fountain of Lamneth"" is not so good. The music is lackluster and the lyrics are overblown and pretentious. The other dog on the album is the silly ""I Think I'm Going Bald"".The classic ""Lakeside Park"", ""Bastille Day"", and ""The Necromancer"" make this album worthwhile. Certainly any Rush fan is going to want to own this album, but people just getting started with Rush who want an introduction to their 70's era music should look to the albums from ""2112"" to ""Hemispheres""."
2,Transitional Recording,"The first half of this album continues the style of Rush's first two albums -- Zeppelin-esque hard rock. ""Bastille Day"" is another furious rocker. ""Lakeside Park"" is a pretty ballad and maybe the most tasteful thing Rush recorded in the early days. ""I Think I'm Going Bald"" is quite stupid. On the second side, though, the band moves on to new territory with its first two stabs at progressive rock epics. ""The Necromancer"" is pretty dire, with Neil Peart's earnest, oh-so-serious narration and the painfully bad Tolkein lyrics. ""The Fountain of Lamneth"" is more listenable but comes off as too fragmented. The band would do far better in this style on the next few studio albums."
2,The Low Point,"This is not a very good album and the band must not think so either. Nothing from this album has been played live since 1980, and even then it was as part of a medley. The only two good songs here are Bastille Day, and song about the French Revolution and Lakeside Park, about a place Neil grew up by. I Think I'm Going Bald is a throw back to the Rush debut album. Sure the musicianship is okay but the song is over all weak. Then there are the two 'epics'. Just because a song is nineteen minutes long doesn't mean it's any good. This albums I guess was sort of an experiment for the band I guess. They did write epics after this that were much better. Check out 2112 or Hemisphers for those."
1,Deceptive,"When I ordered my book it was listed as the ""revised"" version of the book. When I recieved the book it was the older version of the book. It was not what I had ordered or what was desplayed by the seller. The seller refused to replace it with the ""revised"" verson. I would not buy from this seller!"
3,NIce Read,"Good self help book, recommended by my counselor. Good ideas and principles for helping people cope with the problems of life"
3,How David D. Burns makes money,"I bought Dr. Burns 10 Days to Self Esteem before purchasing this suggested supplement, the feeling good handbook. Though the information in both texts is easy to access and usable, there is so much repeated material it is not worth it to buy both books. Buy one or the other. Dr. Burns is getting rich selling us the same information in different books."
2,"Adds nothing to the original ""Feeling Good""","I'm rather disappointed with this book; it adds nothing to what was said in the original Feeling Good (a book I found to be nothing short of revelatory, perhaps the best book on depression self-help I've ever encountered). I'd expected new information and a great deal of useful pencil-and-paper work not contained in the original ""FG"". There is some of that here, but far too little, and functions neither to add new info to nor to expand meaningfully upon the original book. Also, a quarter to a third of the Handbook consists of a guide to medications. Useful info, indeed, but not the sort of thing I go to a volume on cognitive therapy to read up on--this info is available in so many other places, and as presented here will soon be out-of-date as well."
4,worthwhile purchase,"This book was recommended to me and I have been reading through pertinent chapters, finding them informative and useful.It is easy to read and a good book to have in your library."
5,This book has changed my life,This book was recommended to me by my doctor. I went from facing anti-depressants....to no need for drugs at all after I read these pages. This book helped me along the way. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Wish I could get this in cassette form.,"It helped me see some of my folly and to change to a happier me. Also, I saw my mom's problems here; and would like to share this information with her, but she suffers from macular degeneration and therefore avoids reading."
4,Great Tool in the Battle Against Mental Ilness,"Dr. Burns does a good job of simplifying the often confusing world of cognitive therapy. His approach is both effective and practical. Further, he includes a valuable section on antidepressants and antianxiety agents, which are often used--and with great efficacy--in conjuction with cognitive therapy. The proper medication(s) and dedicated work by the patient in DOING THE WRITTEN EXERCISES in this book will greatly benefit anyone suffering from depression and/or anxiety. I highly recommend the book. (I gave it four stars instead of five because it is slightly out of date; a revised 2005 edition would be very welcome.)"
2,Unusable. Only for the independently wealthy <g>,"If you have to work for a living and are out of college, go for something else, like Standish or Ullmann. You wont have the time to make it through these books. To those who say they don't dare review Knuth I say leave beautifications to the pope. It is a crime of arrogance to becloud such a wealth of information with this odd-ball assembly language, MIX. Knuth shall burn in hell for this move of his. The books are full of math, and are really conceptual--what is the importance of using such an obscure language for implementing algorithms? I'd rather see them in pseudo-code, honestly. Academics be damned."
3,Painful,"Yes, I know, we devs should all pay homage to the great Knuth. I don't dispute it. But I also don't want to read a textbook. That's what this is. And unless you're writing low level algorithm libraries, you have no business reading this book. 'Cause if you can't grasp the basics already, this book will do more to scare the crap out of you than anything else.For the hardcore only!"
2,Boring,How can someone who supports the notion of Literate Programing write something this dull and write code examples in such an obscure and trivial language? This is the same philosophy that keeps TEX in a black hole. Produce something powerful and full of features but then forget about making it user friendly. It's really a shame.
5,required reading for anyone serious about coding,"A generation grew up on Knuth, yet many new coders simply do not know who he is.The Art of Computer Programming is required reading for anyone serious about computer programming, it is as simply as that."
1,Nonsense,"This book is really quite useless for those of us who have to program for a living.I mean his definition of an ""Algorithm"" in chaper one couldn't be more obstuse and unhelpful. Why ? Why ? Why did he do this.Why did he write everything in a hypothtical machine language.I really admire Knuth - especially for producing TeX, and then giving it away for free - We all love him for that.But this book is unreadable!"
4,This gives a very pleasing sent to your entire home,"We visited a doctors office where they have one of these in Orchard. You can smell the sent from outside of the office walking down the hall. It is a very pleasent sent. The office workers had no idea where it had been purchased so my wife did some detective work, found it in a local shop and brought it home. It lasted for about a week, our home smelled great, when my daughter or one of her friends, knocked it over and we lost the entire content. Shop doesn't have any more of this sent, which is the only one that the wife and I could agree on. My daughter bought a replacement but it is a different brand. It is nothing in comparison to the strengh or pleasantness of the one we had. I would have given this an easy five stars but I fell it's a little pricey, especially if you plan on using it for floor polish!"
3,A little too big and heavy...,"I was looking for a notebook sleeve, and now that I've received it, I notice that this is actually listed as a notebook ""sleevetop"" case. I was hoping for something a bit more flexible and lightweight so it could fit into a backpack or briefcase....definitely not what this case was designed for. Although I don't doubt that this case would provide protection for a laptop, the newer, smaller laptops will swim in this thing. In fact, I suspect that these are on sale since they are over-sized. Be aware of the dimensions above as it is the size as listed...they come wrapped in plastic and are not boxed... and I would not say it is light. It will add several pounds to the weight of your laptop. Also realize that it does not close at the top so your laptop can slide out; it is stiff enough to retain its open clamshell shape. Also, the dove color is just a mousy gray, so I wouldn't say it's very attractive either."
4,Echo of Harry Bosch past,Another clever mystery by Michael Connelly. I love the LA flavor and lovely plot twists. Harry Bosch remains the consummate detective.
3,It's ok,Good plot but I found Harry's outbursts and exploits a little annoying rather than admirable. Trying to show that he is a man of his convictions but he really just came across as reckless and irresponsible which was distracting.
4,I LOVE HARRY,"Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch is my favorite fictional characterI look forward to each new bookConnelly has continued to deliver over the years a great story for this detective that never gives upmy only comment I would like to give is in the role of Rachel WallingShe had the same tenacious grip on finding Backus(the Poet) and would do anything and bend rules to get this guynow, she is suddenly by the book and is giving up on Harry for not being by the book in order to get to the bottom of this crime(or crimes)I don't know why Harry never told her this, he just lets her fire him for not sticking to the rulesI was hoping they might have a little romance for a while, but she just walks out and he lets her goI know that Bosch has always been a loner, so maybe that is why Connelly set it up this wayI know that Connelly would probably not get enough money but I wish they would make a TV series(HBO) on Harry Bosch and all these booksthey are already a screenplay!"
2,Echo Park,"Interesting plot, which is what drew me to this book in the first place. Also, Harry seemed a bit interesting as well, since I like detective stories. But, sorry, couldn't tell ya much about the other characters since they weren't too developed, nor was the plot. Sure, I know who they were and what was going on throughout, but there wasn't much about them to keep me interested. Figuring it all out was quite a simple task, too. I mean, the author kind of gave it to us! I just felt that this novel was missing that ""something"" that I had expected as I read through it. You know, that jolt of excitement that builds throughout. I had it in the beginning, when I had opened up and began, but after completing a couple more chapters, I already knew where things were headed. I only finished it up to see if I had been correct."
4,"So far, so good","At this point I've read 4 of Connelly's novels; this one with Bosch as the protagonist, two with Haller, and one with both as the main characters.I have to say I prefer the Haller books. Haller for some reason captures some sympathy or empathy for me; not so for Bosch. For that reason I give this only 4 stars. Nevertheless this is a great novel, with the surprise turns I am coming to expect from the author.To be sure, as with almost any fiction, there are a few implausible events or themes. But they are slight and do not detract from the intrigue and interest the story generates, unlike clumsier novelists.A solid action/detective book and I continue enjoying Connelly's works."
5,America's Best Mystery Writer,"In a country (or world) FILLED with good mystery writers, Michael Connelly rears his complex head well above all the others. His major character, Harry Bosch, is fascinating, layered, flawed and brilliant. The cases Connelly invents are frequently based on real-life incidents, which give them a realistic punch. And despite the fact that these novels are clearly character driven, they are execptionally brilliant procedurals. For my money his only competition is from Ian Rankin (in Scotland) and Henning Mankell (in Sweden). And one of the side things I love so much about Mr. Connelly is that he often pays written homage to Mr. Rankin in his own books. Lovely man."
3,A good crime book,"Another very good crime novel by Michael Connelly. However, many characters are just one dimentional. Who really is Rachel, Bosch lover? We hardly know her. Who is Keisha Russell, the reporter? etc. And Bosch's just blindly trying to solve his past murder case. He doesn't care much about the other 8 (or 9) victims. He doesn't care about his lover when attacking the serial murder (with gun) in a dark channel without calling back up. The fox tale seems strange too.Anyway, this book is very good. A page-turner!"
2,I couldn't get into this one,"Normally, a Harry Bosch book is a one to two night read for me. It took nearly a week and a half to scrape through this one. Echo Park felt more like a Lucas Davenport novel than and entry in the Bosch saga. That's not to say anything bad about Lucas, I love him too, but I read Sanford when I feel like a more fantasy-cop sort of ride. I read Harry because he's the gritty real thing.There wasn't really any good character building in this one. Irving wasn't raising cain. And Harry felt like he was a character based on himself.Maybe too much time in Florida is taking some of the edge out of Connelly's writing."
5,Always an engrossing story from Michael Connelly,"My heart did a flip flop because I was holding my breath while reading Echo Park. Harry Bosch is always getting into trouble but when his partner is hit by a bullet, it is both surprising and traumatic. This is an outstanding read. Michael Connelly sets the bar out of sight for every other mystery writer."
4,Harry Bosch,Always look forward to following Harry Bosch on his adventures and this one does not disappoint. Michael Connelly seems to be recovering from his dark period.
2,"Oh Harry, grow up","Echo Park is the first book I have read by Michael Connelly. Half way through it I was thinking that I have found a new author to read. That thought did not survive to the end.The problem is Bosch. I don't like him. I don't know how he behaved in other novels, but in Echo Park he exhibited the emotional development of an 18 year old. He was either busy trying to contain his emotions, or he was recklessly acting out on them. It wore me out. It is hard for me to imagine someone remaining a police officer for any period of time while having as little emotional maturity as displayed by Bosch. This destroys the credibility of the narrative. By the end of the book, I was just glad it was all over."
3,A Good One In the Series,"Echo Park is a very good book in the Harry Bosch series. This time Harry deals with a cold case, a serial killer, and corruption in the police department. The story is at a good pace and there are some twists. I couldn't wait to get home from work and read it. It's a A- work for the crime genre."
2,Not good enough,"A hundred pages into the book, I started scanning for words indicative of actual story development, and not long-winded accounts of little importance. Also, showdowns in dimly lit tunnels just seem contrived to me by now. I like my novels a tad more understated. My first Connelly book is thus a disappointment, although I did feel a slight chill in the beginning. I still feel he has something to offer, so suggestions are welcome. This book just fell short."
1,Not a favorite,"I hate to say it...but I wasn't in love with this book. I've read pretty much everything else Connelly has written, but this book just seemed a little ""off"" based on his normal level of suspense and ability to connect the dots as to ""why"" things happened. It almost seemed like the author was a little burned out or hurried on this one. It's just my opinion...and you know what people say about opinions...."
2,Hollow Park,"Dear Mr. Connelly,Perhaps H. Bosch did not receive the memo -- he needs to retire and stay retired. Old Blue Eyes kept retiring and coming back; he was never as good and neither is Bosch."
3,Where have you strayed Harry?,"Good, but not up to par Michael. You reveal the real killer Harry is after at the beginning of the book but then never bring him into the plot till the very end. Maybe you think it's clever but you create the image that our boy Harry is quite dense. Please bring Harry back to his sharp intuitive self."
2,What a disappointment!,"Having read several of Connelly's books, I expected this one to be a cut above the usual crime thriller genre. I was sorely disappointed. Although the plot is somewhat interesting, the characterizations are weak and there is just too much tough cop talk and unbelievable heroics. The narration is weak, especially the personification of the FBI agent girlfriend, which is absolutely grating. I did finish it, but wish I could get my money back."
5,Echo Park,"Wonderful as always. Every Harry Bosch I read I say it is the best, but this is a really good story."
5,Another Connelly Winner,"If you are a Michael Connelly fan, you will fully enjoy it. If you are new to this author, start now."
4,With as Many Twists and Turns as a mountain road,"This is the first Michael Connelly novel that I've read, and I salute the author for the plot and the way he crafted the story. Although I understand it is #12 in a series it stood alone very well, the author bringing you up to speed on the history of Bosch and his relationships in a hurry. It was not too complicated to follow, and I loved the way he led you from one scene to another. By the time you get through it you have a good plot, enough twists to keep your interest, and a satisfying outcome - all essential elements of a good detective story. Unlike so many stories that have the protagonist and the love interest rushed together in a ""happy forever after"" commitment this was not the case in #12, so leads you to expect another good novel from Connelly."
4,Growing on me,"Not all of Connelly's books are good, so you really have to pick and choose, and read reader reviews to get a good sense of which ones are the duds. This relatively recent one is pretty good. Connelly was better earlier in his fiction writing career. He often seems to be just cranking out product now, hoping that Hollywood will strike again, as it did with ""The Lincoln Lawyer,"" a lousy film but a good payday for the author. This one moves along briskly. Some of the same characters carry over from previous books. I still can't really picture or get a good handle on Harry Bosch, the detective who populates this series. I don't especially like cops, and these books are seemingly for those who like cop novels. The plot works pretty well. The author saves a few twists for the very ending, which seems to be his trademark. Easy reading, if that's what you seek."
4,Tough case for Harry,"A most excellent book in the Harry Bosch series! A hand pump in the air for Harry for solving this one. (Oh, come on, you knew he would!)"
4,What are the limits of right and wrong?,"In the 12th book, Harry Bosch had returned to active duty in the LAPD Open-Unsolved unit. When a serial killer Raynard Waits claims he had killed Marie Gesto in 1993, Bosch insists he joins the investigation. Together with his former-returned lover, the FBI Agent Rachel Walling, Harry Bosch finds himself, again, in the middle of a conspiracy that smacks of money and politics.As usual, the plot sparkles with surprising twists - such as how Harry Bosch missed a crucial clue back in 1993 that allowed Raynard Waits to kill nine more women - but sometimes the prose drowns in the details of food and music. With Harry Bosch, Connelly tests the limits of right and wrong and what is a `correct choice', but it feels as if Connelly had maximized the character's stretch. Although Echo Park is not one of Michael Connelly's spectacular books (such as The Poet or The Lincoln Lawyer), it is still a great read."
4,Bosch on the edge,"Bosch in on the edge in this book; he has been working the Maria Gesto case on his own time ever since her disappearance in 1993. She was never found - dead OR alive - so the file sits and mocks Bosch. When a man accused of two murders offers to come clean about several other open murders in order to avoid being put to death, he includes Marie Gesto in the bunch. Bosch is called in to listen to the testimony and do some work to ensure the department is not being scammed. When Bosch discovers a clue that was overlooked that might have helped him solve the Gesto case - and prevented all the murders by this same guy in the meantime - he starts to lose it.This is a dark book in the series, yet one that gives us a lot of insight into Bosch and his world. Don't miss it!"
2,It started out okay,"I feel today's thriller/mystery writers have a tough time conjuring up twists and turns. This book was no exception. After all, it's all been said. With thousands of books coming out each year it has to be a difficult task to come up with something interesting.I thank Mr. Connelly for trying. Out of loyalty I will continue to buy his books. I have for years.I just read the excerpt from his next volume. Like ""Echo"" it starts out swell."
5,Great stuff!,"Poor Harry Bosch, he can't even buy a break! Good book though, unless you don't have a pulse you should enjoy it a lot. Give it a whirl..."
5,Good Old Harry,"I just finished reading Echo Park and really enjoyed it. I like the way Michael Connelly keeps the action moving and keeps the reader wondering what is going to happen next. I usually have some of the villians identified but in this case I did not see Abel Pratt involved in the plot. I too feel it would have been good to see what happened to those corrupt people. However, I used my imagination which perhaps is what the author intended."
3,"Okay Plot, Too Much PD Politics","My first Michael Connelly book was The Lincoln Lawyer and I was so impressed that I decided to read more of his work. I know that the Harry Bosch series have been going on for a long time, but I decided to read Echo Park first because it has just come out and the first chapter hooked me. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed. The plot was okay and the twists weren't that surprising. My problem with this book is that there's too much focus on Police Department politics and the plot, motive and character development, which are key the elements in mysteries, are not original. There's also the typical stubborn cop who gets pulled out of the case but challenges the system and stays in. I have seen this in so many crime novels that I rolled my eyes. In short, Echo Park is an okay read but nothing spectacular. There is no wow effect and, with so many mysteries hitting the shelves every week, I only give five stars to the ones that truly amaze me."
2,A waste of time,"This is my second Connelly book. I thoroughly enjoyed Lincoln Lawyer, but found Echo Park a disappointment. Although the story line held potential, the story teller failed. A mediocre book, at best."
3,Not the best and not the worst,"I won't say a whole lot about this one. It is average, not as good as several others in the series (the black echo) not as bad as a few others (the overlook).It's readable, not terribly original, somewhat predictable."
4,"The trouble with Harry is, well, . . . Harry.","Connelly's Harry Bosch has a bouillabaisse on his plate; a serial killer on the loose, his FBI girl friend who is mad at him, an ambitious prosecutor running for office, smarmy defense counsel, and corruption striking close to home. Harry handles all with his usual reckless hamhandness. He would not be lovable Harry, otherwise. This police procedural mystery, a predecessor book to ""The Overlook,"" couples all this excitement with Harry's recent penchant for stumbling over old records and closed files and solving old crimes."
4,Echo Park,"I've read all of Michael Connelly's books, they are always a good read. Harry Bosch is a little quirky, which makes it fun to read, also."
4,Forever a tunnel rat,"Good old Harry Bosch does it again. Connelly is lucky to have him in his team.Who else would have carried the same old story with the same old dedication to upsetting his bosses and the same devotion to doing right at all cost?It is amazing how often MC can repeat the same pattern, including the love interest stereotypes, without being boring. Amazing.Still, I would suggest that MC should seek his long term career plan more in the line of the Lincoln Lawyer.For the medium term, Harry has to eradicate California's substantial serial killer population, plus do away with the supply of bad cops. Hopefully.P.S. Of course I fully endorse Harry's taste in music, here Miles Davis' Kind of Blue and Monk & Coltrane at Carnegie Hall. However it would be nice to get some less obvious recommendations."
3,An Unanswered Question,"The book is a good read. Connelly did a good job generally in depicting the psychological profiles of all the main characters. The attention to legal procedures is also convincing.But towards the end a question remains unanswered to me: who initiated the deal between Pratt and the Garlands? Pratt claimed it was the Garlands and vice versa but it was never clarified in the book. This leads to a bigger question: whoever initiated the deal, why would Anthony Garland contemplate or accept it when Bosch couldn't tie him to the murder for 13 years with any hard evidence? By taking the deal, Anthony confessed to the murder, albeit to a supposedly corrupted cop, by exposing the burial site, which the police would never have been able to locate otherwise. I think Connelly owes the readers an explanation."
3,"Not the Best Bosch, Not the Worst","This is a good addition to the Harry Bosch series -- not Connelly's best book (probably ""Angel's Flight"") and not his worst (probably ""Nine Dragons"")."
5,Excellent Read,"This was my first Michael Connelly book, but it will not be my last. This book is well written, and held my attention from the first page. Since reading this book, I have downloaded 3 other Harry Bosch books. I am so pleased that I purchased my first Michael Connelly book, because it was worth every penny of the purchase price."
3,Solid; 3.5 Stars,"Like a number of Connelly's books, this mystery is a successful hybrid of 2 traditions. One progenitor is the Raymond Chandler detective tradition of crime investigators obsessively seeking the truth, often at considerable personal cost, in a corrupt environment. The second tradition is that of the police procedural. Connelly does well in bringing these elements together in a decently plotted book with enough psychological dimension to provide decent characterization. His spare writing style works well. Like several of his books, Connelly introduces a major and a bit contrived plot twist at the very end.Readers who like this type of book would do well to pick up some of Ross Macdonald's superior Lew Archer books, some of which are still in print."
1,Defective!!,"I bought this in Jan, when it was discounted. Got it out of the box today and the motor smoked itself in the first 5 minutes of use. Smelled bad right off the bat, but I just thought it was normal new machinery break-in, but it got worse and soot began pouring from the exhaust port.I'm VERY disappointed and being I'm beyond Amazon's 30 day return window, I'll have to deal directly with Hoover's warranty department. We'll see how that goes and I'll report back with the results. It did, however do a pretty decent job on the small patch I was able to clean before it went Tango Uniform.Bummed in Orlando :("
4,It cleaned our stained stink carpet.,"Yes, it worked well. Actually, I decided in buying this product after I got almost 2/3 gallon of milk poured in my carpet by my 2 years old son. But, when I received this product, the residue of the milk-even me and my wife spent 2 or 3 hours of cleansing the milk from carpet- started making awfule smell not only out of the flower area also the air because it's been almost a week. Fortunately, The only hope worked so fine.But, there are some caviats. Old dirt or stains are almost still there even after 2 applications in 1 week period(but textture is a bit better). And, the suction is not that much good, so the it looks like take almost 10 to 12 hours to feel dry on the surface."
1,Never had a worse experience,"After years of cleaning my own carpets and being semi satified with cheaper models I decided to splurge and spend more on what I thought would be a superior product...NOT!I can't even express how frustrating this cleaner was. The water barely dribbled out. I kept taking the tank out and re-inserting it thinking I didn't have it seated properly...that was not the case. The unit just did not work properly. After almost 3 hours of frustration I boxed it back up, printed out a shipping label and sent it back to Amazon.In my opinion this unit is terrible and certainly not worth spending $175 on."
1,Problems with water return hose,"We purchased this unit less then a year ago and after relatively light use, four or five area rugs, the water return hose spilt. The hose is internal to the unit and fully protected by the base so I'm not sure how it split."
5,Awsome,"Since we remodeled 6 years ago, new carpeting upstairs, our son or friends have occuppied the space. All have now moved out. Holy WOW!!! The carpet looked 25 years old. I didn't think it could get so dirty since you couldn't see it most of the time.I went by the reviews that I read here and went by the reviewers recommendations. The machine works as well as everyone says it does. The carpeting is on it's way to looking as good as when it was put in.I would absolutly recommend this machine to everyone. It paid for itself with the first use.Cons: NONE"
4,Very good cleaner for the money.,This cleaner came fully assembled and ready to use. The tank covers are a little hard to remove until you learn the technique. The cleaner cleans the carpet better than any I have used. We use hot water since the cleaner does not heat the water internally. The only drawback is that it does not suck the water back up as well as some others. This has not proven to be a problem for us since the carpet dries overnight. The gets the pet hair very well and is very easy to clean. The upholstery tool is very convenient since it completely removes when not needed. I definately would recommend this cleaner. It isn't perfect but overall better that the others in the price range. There have been no quality problems yet.
4,Good product,"We have been using an Oreck carpet shampooer and it really was a piece of garbage. This (the Hoover)is quiet, easy to use and it does a real good job. My wife loves its looks also. We are very pleased."
4,Good Buy,"This carpet cleaner works pretty well. We got a new puppy and are still in the process of potty training, so this come in handy. It is great to get the dirt up and cleans easily. Water compartments are a little small and you have to change the water frequently. Works well with boiled water. I really enjoy it and it is easy to store. Overall I am happy with this purchase."
4,Great Cleaner,"I have used this cleaner several times. At first I thought the resevior tank was too small and that I would be emptying it several times, but that isn't the case. It gets a lot of dirt up and it is easy to use and clean. No problems yet."
5,A Winner!,"Works REALLY well, very easy to use- just be prepared to see some really gross black water come out of your carpet, no matter how clean you think it is!!! Highly recommended."
4,Very Good,For the price you can't beat this cleaner... Had the old version it was also great..Don't spend on companies do it yourself
4,Good value,Tried this cleaner compared to another brand and it by far cleans better and does not leave streks on the carpet.
1,NO SUCTION and terrible customer service,I used my Hoover Agility for the first time and the suction quit after 5 minutes. I followed all the trouble shooting instructions and it still didn't work. I called Hoover and spoke with a rep who was basically reading out of the manual. I sat on hold for 21 minutes only to hear a manager tell me that they cannot give out technical information because it's against their policy. I guess this is to ensure their Hoover service centers get the business. I'm returning the Hoover and NEVER purchasing a Hoover again.
5,Hoover Agility Carpet Cleaner,"We had our carpets cleaned by a commercial outfit. We were not happy with the results.The agility cleaned up the mess they made.Very happy with it so far, no leaks, no problems. My only concern is the plastic tabs on the tanks, I wonder how long they will last. Time will tell. Our old Hoover carpet cleaner lasted 9 years."
2,ok,"i bought this to replace an aging hoover steam cleaner and ultimately sent it back. it cleaned ok but it left a good 3/4 of the water it put down in the carpet. with my old hoover the carpets dried in 2 hours. with this one they were still wet 24 hours later. the water that came back up was dirty and the machine got some stains out, but overall left the carpet looking dingy. i was very disappointed."
2,Disappointing purchase,"The unit worked for approxiamately half an hour before the brushes stopped rotating and the unit became unuseable. Hoover Customer Service refused to make an exchange unless multiple attempts at repair were made. Five star service from Amazon, however, allowing a return for credit and even paying for return shipping!As for the cleaning job done before the breakdown, several passes were required to get out the dirt but job was acceptable. Rental units from grocery have done better."
4,Hoover rules,"This machine cleans BETTER than those rental units from supermarkets, rental places etc. I was amazed, even though it does not use steam. Got out OLD pet stains. It does better, however (contrary to what I would have thought) with ""genuine Hooover"" detergent. I usually don't believe this, but true in this case.However, I got it at Lowe's at what I recall was their REGULAR price of 169.95 just a month ago. The price here is not good at all."
1,"Started to break in six months, finished breaking in 1 yr.","My last carpet cleaner was an old Sears cannister thing I bought about 11 years ago. It was completely plastic and I thought it would never last. I got 10 yrs out of it.I bought my hoover agility last year since it had the best reviews. I used it mostly for pet stains here and there. Never cleaned more than one room or half a dozen cat vomit spots at a time, on average once a month.After six months I no longer could clean a full room, as the brushes no longer rotated, and it would no longer spray cleaning fluid out the front. Since only the hand wand worked at that point, it became a $179.99 spot cleaner.Well, the pump gave up today, after owning this machine for a year and one month. Now it is a $179.99 wet-vac, and not a very good one.Does anyone make a household appliance that will last these days? Assembled in the USA? What was assembled here, the UPC symbol on the box?"
3,Great Cleaning - No Frills,"The product does an excellent job of cleaning my carpet. Cleaning is quick as it does a great job of sucking up the water in just a few passes. It does not leak as long as the tanks are inserted properly.However, it is not as convenient as others I have used. The tanks are small (1 gallon) so it needs to be emptied and refilled often. The cleaning solution goes directly into the tank, so you need to empty the tank and refill with clean water to rinse instead of just flippng a switch. Lastly, it is fairly narrow so it requires a few more passes - though this can be an advantage in tight areas."
3,"Good enough, could be better",I used to have a Bissel carpet cleaner. Bissel seemed more powerful yet quiet.Had problems with transmission though and would get clogged often.Hoover's water tank is kinda small. The machine is quite noisy for the size. It cleans ok. I don't think that the brushes are doing a very good job cleaning. They become soft and don't apply enough pressure to the carpet.Would I buy it again? Probably not.
2,Scrubbers wouldn't spin,"Purchased this as a replacement for a Bissell ProHeat ClearView that simply stopped pumping after approximately 5 uses. I have pets, and pet hair got caught in the Hoover Agility's spin scrub gears very quickly. After cleaning my living room and dining room, the brushes wouldn't spin, even after disassembling and cleaning the removable brush cartridge.The Agility is very light and easy to use, and my carpet dried quickly. I was concerned that the plastic latches that secure the caps to each water reservoir would break easily.I returned it and purchased a Eureka Atlantis, and I'm very pleased with that cleaner so far."
4,Good performance...great value for the price.,"You can't beat the performance of the Agility at its price point. I live with Barfy the Wondercat as well as a dog. This unit does a great job of cleaning up not only the usual carpet dirt but the inevitable pet stains as well. Highly recommended!Since I have not had the cleaner very long, I can't give it five stars. In six months, I'll revisit and update!"
4,Not powerful enough,"The suction is not strong enough -- too much water stays in the carpet. The power brush attachment is very convenient for cleaning upholstery. The vacuum is pretty heavy, and I remove all of the attachments from it before operating it to make it a bit easier to move.These complaints aside, I am happy with the machine."
1,Sucks,"If you want to spread water all over your carpet, use a garden hose. Piece of crap, brushes dont spin, will NOT vacuum up water. Call Stanley Steamer and save your cash and closet space!"
3,good little cleaner,"bought this thing over a year ago and not many complaints. i love the spinner brushes, the attachments, and the extra solution button. the only real things i dont care too much for is the tanks are really small ( maybe a gallon) and it doesn't have an on board heater. so not really anything too bad. for big jobs i would recommend getting a rug doctor but this thing is fine for the occasional spot cleaning."
4,"Very good however,I have some thoughts.","First off this is a good product and cleans my carpets fast and it heats the water which helps a lot,But here are my issues,The design of the side by side tanks well if the cord is wrapped up before you put the tanks back on,it's will catch on the cord,and the cord is a little too short for me,prehaps a extra foot or so would be nice.The good things are it's light weight and very easy to use and store the handle comes down to make easier to store and it comes with a attacments for small areas to clean,Hoover did a good job on this one,I only wish for more colors to choose from a purple steam cleaner. Ummm I wish I would have got the blue one.Oh well at least I have clean carpets.:)"
4,SteamVac Review,"This really isn't a steamvac, since it uses hot water. It did a very good job of cleaning some really dirty carpets. Overall it was easy to use. I did have some problems getting the hot water tank onto the machine without water being released out the bottom, so would recommend not putting it on while it is on the carpet - just more water to suck up.That said we are happy with it and glad we bought it and would recommend it."
4,Great Machine,"I have not had this cleaner for very long so I can't give it 5 stars. However, it did a wonderful job on my carpets. Very easy to use and fairly lightweight. Very easy to clean when you are done using it. I would highly recommend this cleaner."
5,works like a charm,"I used to have on old Hoover steam cleaner. It must have weighed 20 lbs! And it was difficult to clean etc. This new one is easy to move (I'm a small person) and very easy to fill, empty and clean. My carpets are clean and fresh smelling--if you remember to go over the carpet several times to suction up the water it dries within an hour. I'm glad I bought it as I have 2 aging pets that have ""accidents"" more often."
4,"Overall, it cleaned very well.","Relatively easy to use; great versatility. Awkward pouring solution from included measuring cup into tank. Somewhat easy to clean after use; had trouble removing cover. Still unclear on where/how to store all of the various attachments.Though recovery was not quite up to par, overall, it cleaned very well."
3,Neat Vacuum,"We moved to a carpeted apartment and did not have any prior vacuum experience. After quite a bit of research we chose this one a month ago and we are quiet pleased with it. Its great as long as you use it with steam. It makes the carpet look fresher. Easy to use, have to be little careful with parts as its plastic...but Good quality. Substandard job with picking hair and carpet fibers. Also if you have to just do simple vacuuming without using detergent/spray, its not that great. I feel it does not have enough suction. Have to keep it clean especially the brush. Loses suction if the lint filter is not cleant often.Cheers!!!"
1,Same problem as Patricia,"Mine is a more expensive model, but the gaskets go bad on the clean water tank after a couple of uses. I've replaced the tank 4 times already and the most recent time was just a few months ago. This weekend we went to shampoo the rugs and the tank is leaking again. It's a problem with the tanks and has made me swear off Hoover products."
1,Where has our quality gone,"I order the agility because of its great reviews. The carpet cleaner I received was terrible it never sucked. I read the direction, put the water with the soap in the container and proceed to do my carpet. Out of a gallon of water I put in the machine it only sucked a cup of water out. No matter how many times I went over the carpet it would not pick up anymore water. I had bought the machine at Costco and they let me return it. I was using a Hoover that was 15 years old and that sucked better than the new one. I still need a new carpet cleaner but I am afraid to buy one I really hate returning thing to the store. Where has our quality gone? Maybe we need things made in America again."
2,First time using it.,"Okay I have had a bissel in the past for 4 years it broke. So I did allot of research of hoover steamvac. i came to find that this one had allot of good reviews. So I bought it. I used it the first time yesterday, and it would not SUCK up the water I dd my whole house and it only had 1 cup of water it suck up. I read and instructions and even tried different thing, but nope it did not work."
5,Question about Hoover Agility,"I read one review here where someone mentioned using the Agility to clean up spill on a tile floor. I'm wondering if the Agility can be used to clean hard floors in general, like a power mop? I have lots of vinyl (sheet & tile) flooring and trying to keep it all clean is killing my back. Any suggestions?"
2,Works Great until it breaks,"I purchased this unit about a year ago, and have been happy with its performance. It is light and manageable but still does a great job on my carpets. However, as mentioned in numerous reviews, I was concerned about the flimsy plastic design. Not surprisingly, a hose broke 4 months ago and it had to go in for repair. Four months later it is still in the repair shop. Why? - because Hoover (or the company that bought the Hoover name - PTI) can't seem to be bothered to send the repair shop the replacement parts or if they do they are the wrong ones.I suspected I might be in for trouble when I had to go to three different shops to find one that would repair Hoovers. The two previous stated the same thing: It was too hard to get parts from Hoover and they didn't want the hassle from their clients when they had to wait.Buyer Beware - the units work well but be prepared for a ridiculously long wait if it does need to be serviced."
3,one great cleaner,"I really am pleased with my Agility carpet cleaner. It is much easier than the other machines that I have used. I love the fact that the tanks are super simple to remove and replace. The only thing I can see unhandy is the foot controlled power switch, but I am getting used to it. I would definetly recommend this machine."
2,Suction sucks,Other users complained about the poor suction from the unit. I couldn't agree more. The damn thing hardly sucks up any of the water sprayed into the carpet. You have to use the handheld attachment unit to suck up the water. I have an older model that sucks up at least twice as much.
4,Worth the money.,Worked well and doesn't leak water or soap like my previouse one did. A separate container for the soap would be easier and more cost efficient instead of mixing it in with the water everytime like this model does. Isn't the best cleaner but good enough and worth the money.
1,Fell apart after 20 uses,"I liked it while it lasted. It didn't get rid of stains, but had a generally positive effect on the appearance of my carpets. I also broke the rules and used in on my hardwood floors. They looked great! But both hoses broke after about 20 uses, and the repair guy said that it wasn't even worth fixing for the $80 it would have cost. One star may seem harsh, but it doesn't matter how well it cleans - if I have to replace an appliance after 20 uses, it's not worth buying in the first place."
4,Great product,"I really like this product. Except for it being a little on the heavier side to move up and down steps, it is a great product. It works great and is easy to clean and easy to fill. Plus, the handle folds down to make for more compact storage. It really does a good job on the carpets and you can definitely see a huge difference. I would definitely purchase another Hoover product again."
5,You need to buy this,"If you find yourself thinking about renting one of those units from the grocery store some Saturday afternoon, buy this machine instead. That's exactly what I did and I'm never looking back. This carpet cleaner is easy, neat & does a darn good job."
4,"Wonderful, I love how she writes",There is just something so real about her stories and the people. You cant help but like sara and feel for her. Nick was a little slow in realizing there was something very wrong in Sara's life and that she was more than just the rich trophy wife figure that the world saw. her husband was very creepy. Weir did a good job of portraying him and I think the night Sara walked into the lake hoping to never come out was a very strong image of how hopeless she felt.
1,Long night moon,I didn't care for the story. I felt depressed when it was done. I need seven more words to submit.
2,Don't recommend,"Within two months the dock stopped getting power. I tried buying a new AC Adpater power source, but the problem was obviously with the unit itself. Kodak said, ""too bad. you can send it in for repairs."" Hardly worth the trouble. Not crazy about the C330 camera either."
1,"No AV cable, description promises one","This is nothing more than an expensive battery charger. Before ordering, I sent a note to Kodak, asking what was needed to display photos from a C310 on a TV. Their response was to buy the Kodak Easyshare Camera Dock Series 3. I looked on the Amazon web site and with the description for this product, it said ""In addition to a USB 1.1 cable, the Camera Dock Series 3 also comes with an AV cable, enabling you to display photo slideshows to friends and family via your TV."" This is a lie. No AV cable is included. It's another order and another $20 to get the cable. No wonder that Kodak is a fraction of the company it once was."
5,Kodak Easyshare Camera Dock (Series 3),This item arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition. It works perfectly and is under full warranty. I would not hesitate to order from Amazon in the future.
4,camera dock works fine,"Got this camera dock to help charge my camera. It works fine. This is cheaper than at WalMart. Wish the camera had a plug in charger, rather than me having to purchase this charger separately. No problems with it."
2,"too expensive, was missing the camera adapter","it was rocky, and missed the adapter as if $50 wasn't enough for this thing, they want to bleed the user for an adapter this generic model. boo.but it did work well for what it was."
1,Kodak Easyshare Camera Dock (Series 3),"Received this purchase BEFORE time promised and in excellent condition. For first time digital camera users such as myself, this was easy to use and a good starting system."
2,no parts,It Was not all there the part to put the camera on did not come and i need that to put the camera on so please it for a c875 camera please think you w.b
3,Camera dock disappointment,"This dock is supposed to work with my new Kodak Z812IS digital camera. The dock arrived promptly, and it was brand new, in the original box. Unfortunately, when I hooked it up and attempted to dock my camera, it wouldn't work. I was really disappointed, as I travel a lot and prefer to use rechargable batteries and take the dock with me. Every time Kodak issues a new camera, it takes a new dock, too. I returned the dock to the seller the next day and asked for store credit and a catalog, but I have not heard from the seller yet. I'm hoping I won't be out the $50!"
4,"Kodak ""does it their way""...","The easy share dock is a great little device delivering everything promised. My one complaint, albeit minor, is that the entire ""Easy Share"" system of Kodak might be wonderful to someone new to digital photography. It would be very useful to that newbie in storing pictures with a PC to hard drive, CD or DVD, but I found the software's folder stucture contrary to the way I do things. ""its way"" isn't flexible enough to allow me to continue to do various picture tasks my way. After using EasyShare to download pictures from the camera via the dock, I always have to move files around to suit the way I've done things for several years. As to the dock, I'd recommend it to anyone. It's a nice unit."
1,Does Not Work,"Has not worked since I bought it. After several tech support calls to Kodak and receipt of a new cable, the rep finally told me that most people do not use this dock to transfer pictures - they have problems with it. I use it as a battery charger."
1,"Bad bad ,Kodak","After careful research to be sure that this was the proper dock for my new Kodak to which I have been faithful to as a local company(Rochester NY) I purchased the dock only to find out that the wrong battery was supplied with it. After contacting Kodak customer support I was informed that the correct battery only came packaged if you purchased the camera and dock together.After a long conversation I was bottom line told,too bad so sad.Well there goes your local company support for the price of a battery.HenryThis is in no way Amazons fault."
5,Kodak Camera Dock,Very easy to install; Great tool for easily downloading photos to computer and removing from camera; Would recommend to anybody.
2,worked at first...,"but after about 3 months stopped recharging batteries, only one light lit up and would stay there instead of charging back up to three. Thought the batteries might just have been spent so i got new batteries for the cam and these brand new batteries still only get the one light, so i mooed like a cow and flopped like a one eyed salmon trying to get upstream."
5,Great additon to the camera,The camera is good but the dock is what makes getting the photos to the computer and keeping it charged so easy. Great value.
2,Misnamed and disappointing,"My daughter loves dinosaurs, so we got her this to help her learn more about dinosaurs, their names, the time periods they lived in, etc. Since this book calls itself an encyclopedia, I assumed that this basic information would be present. I also assumed that the information would be presented in an organized, logical way. I was wrong on both counts. The book is a fairy interesting picture book about dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, and it gives a basic outline of the timeline of the animals. It gives very little else in the way of useful information. There are pictures of dinosaurs that are unlabelled, so when my daughter says, ""What kind is that?"" I have to say that I don't know. Very little information is given about the dinosaurs, and nearly all of it is about groups of dinosaurs (sauropods, etc.) rather than individual ones. I was very disappointed with this book; it if calls itself an encyclopedia, it should be arranged like one."
3,"Nice pumps..stylish, but (maybe) painful","I loved these pumps the moment I laid eyes on them. They are very stylish and their cut-out designs surely add to the beauty of these simple-yet-elegant shoes. Unfortunately; they are not for the long haul! They tend to irritate your scrunched-up toes a little after wearing for long periods of time- and if you have a fairly wide foo-size, then these are a definate no-no! I love them besides..but they do hurt after a bit. (perfect for females with preferences of the 'Narrow' cut-shoes)."
1,I am so disspointed with this collection!!!!,"Don't be fooled by this Teddy Pendergrass collection. They are NOT the original recordings. I was taken for a ride and wasted $4.21 cents on this horrible CD!!!! What a complete rip off!!! If you buy this expecting to hear the original smash hits, you'll be very disappointed. They don't sound anything like the originals at all. It doesn't say anywhere on the CD that these are re-recorded, but trust me---they are!!!! I am soo disappointed in this CD, but since I opened it, I can't get my money back. So back to the search for the real thing. If it ain't broke---just don't fix it!!! And his Teddy's old stuff is the best."
4,THIS ONE'S FOR ME!,"Already having admitted a weskness for Swarovski crystal I can't resist this rosary bead necklace and cross.The pink beads in the necklace are one of my favorite shades and will look wonderful with a black dress. The cross with the Swarovski crytals will shimmer and shine.I love the lobster claw clasp, as I've found that to be the safest and most durable. Also, I have one of those little safety pin like gizmos that allows you to shorten a necklace - so this will get double duty also as a choker."
3,Paris Collection,This is a cute necklace. It is fun to wear with casual to semi dressy clothes. It does break fairly easily. My boyfriend just tried to unhook it and it snapped .I did purchase another one. Not everyone will like it .It depends on what you are looking for.I would not pay listed price though. Amazon had it on sale.
1,An actual piece of (eventual) garbage.,"Aside from the difficult time I have had with this product, I feel that is it very important for you to know before purchasing it that the rechargeable battery inside cannot be replaced. So, when it wears out, as they all eventually do, you throw this device away.Personally, I am not in the habit of throwing out things I have spent $80 on.I, too, have been unable to load pix into the internal memory. When I called Kodak's support line for help the person answering the phone was compleely unaware of the product. His final answer why it didn't work was incompatibility with my Mac Computer - v. 10.3. Our 2 kodak digital cameras work fine, seems odd the technologies would part ways here.It's nifty and I was so looking forward to it. Oh well."
4,easyshare?,"I was neve able to get pictures into the machine as per their instructons, I got around that by getting a memory card and loading the pictures directly into that, then inserting the card in the viewer, thus increasing the capacity as well."
2,"If Kodak won't do it, Asia will","I bought this device for $29 and the money should have gone to one of the new portable MP3/Photo players.This is a great idea but a silly ploy for Kodak to force you to install their software. I would suggest using a driverless card reader to put pics on a SC card then use the card slot on the Picture Viewer device to load pictures. Forget syncronizing and making Easy Share viewer the default for all your media!Come on Kodak! People just want a viewer that works with Mac or XP and is ABLE TO SORT PICTURES in some rudimentary way.That is it, it's that simple. Get a couple PHD's on it before the Taiwanese or Koreans beat you to the profits."
1,waste of time,"1. 6 hours personal time2. 2 hours computer tech time3. 3 hours Kodak tech time (phone)4. Still would not export or import pictures (probably a driver problem)5. Kodak had a great idea, but failed in making it practical and easy to use!"
3,Okay,It was kind of complicating at first to figure out how to download the pictures in the picture viewer. When we finally figured it out the pictures looked wonderful. You just have to have patience with it.
4,Where's the instructions?,"This is a cool little item. It works easily once you firure it out. However, there are no meaningful instructions. When I called customer support, they couldn't figure out why there are heardly any instructions. It took me several hours to get it to work. Mind you, I'm no tekkie, but many grandparents, who would love it, would never figure it out."
1,Waste of money,"This was a huge waste of money, did not work correctly, disc for downloading software did not work and Kodak would not replace it due it being severely out of date."
2,Great for setting or changing the mood but instructions are poor,"What a great alternative to fishing through boxes of photos when you want to re-visit memories. It took me about an hour to get it to work because I am not great with this kind of thing This is a fun little item. It functions well once you get comfortable with running it. The instructions were very poor however, it should have only taken 5 minutes to figure out."
2,No secrets here,"There are much better books out there-start with Ben Hogan's Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf by Ben Hogan, and move on to The Complete Hogan: A Shot-by-Shot Analysis of Golf's Greatest Swing by Jim McLean (January 3, 2012). Once you understand Hogan-then try: The Stack and Tilt Swing: The Definitive Guide to the Swing That Is Remaking Golf by Michael Bennett (November 12, 2009.The putting portion that the Dr. puts out here isnt horrible, but I recommend: Putting My Way: A Lifetime's Worth of Tips from Golf's All-Time Greatest by Jack Nicklaus (October 19, 2009)-unlike the late Dr. who wrote this book, Jack has been there, done that, got the green jacket...."
3,More golf secrets,"I obtained a copy of THE GOLF SECRET by the late H A Murray many years ago and was facinated by his ideas. As a consequence, I recently bought MORE GOLF SECRETS in the belief that it would enhance my understanding of the golf swing he advocated.This was not to be with the exception of his ideas on putting, a subject not included in his original book. It has it's merrits but conflicks somewhat with the ideas of my other favourite instruction authors, most notably Percy Boomer and John Jacobs. This is not a book I would recommend."
4,4 stars,I said 4 stars but I don't feel like typing in 18 more words so you will have to take it like this
2,Bert's guitar wizardry cannot forgive his wife's weak vocals,"Much as I love Bert Jansch, this offering from his now spouse just cannot live up to the seminal pairing of Bert's nimble guitar and soulful voice with the crystaline pipes of Jacqui McShee in Pentangle. Auerbach's quavering voice wears thin after one listening, and few of the tunes, mostly penned by the record's producer, rise above the mediocre."
5,A Tragedy of Lost Life and Memory,"I found this book quite compelling, and tore through it in one sitting. O'Donnell brings to life a whole era, and keeps things moving along to their tragic conclusion. That tragedy is twofold: First, the 1,021 human beings (mostly women and children) who, due to avarice, neglect and stupidity, lost their lives in what was (prior to 9/11/01) the worst single-event disaster in New York City. The second tragedy -- also an all-too-human one -- is that this horrible disaster has, for the most part, been forgotten. With the 100th anniversary of the ""General Slocum"" disaster upon us shortly, while the horror of 9/11 begins to recede ever so gradually, this book is timely and highly recommended."
4,"Not enough pictures, slow moving at first.","Although the book is well written there should have been more pictures included in the book, I've seen other pictures of thedisaster that should have been included.It takes the author 70 pages to get the story off the ground. I'msure that most readers aren't interested in the number of newspapers that were available in New York at the time of the disaster. Also most readers would not be interested in the Mayorof New York at the time of the disaster."
5,One of the deadliest disasters in New York history.,"One hears about some very familiar disasters, but I was not familiar with the General Slocum steam boat disaster. Over 1,000 people (mainly women and children) died in this disaster on the East River. O'Donnell does a superb job of detailing New York at the turn of the century and the dangers associated with steamship travel. Then he goes into great detail about the disaster and the aftermath of the sinking of the General Slocum.I believe O'Donnell does a fair job of detailing who failed in this disaster. The owner, USSIS, and the Captain all were to blame for this dangerous situation. The result was the decimation of a large German immigrant church community.O'Donnell's short chapters, and his coverage from all angles gives the reader a clear picture of the disaster. One can understand the nature of this tragedy and the effect on New York City."
5,Don't leave home without this thing!,Most new augers come with this but if you are like me and have a 20+ year old Jiffy it no longer has one and the blades are not removable so protecting them is a must!
2,Hit/Miss,"I recently purchased this CD. I thought since Offer Nissam was connected (in some way) with mixes on this it might be pretty good. Boy was I wrong. There are not that many tracks on this CD; however, most of the tracks are of a considerable length. And that would be great if they gave you anything you wanted to listent to for 9 minutes.There are only three tracks on this entire CD that are worth anything. The others are mind-numbing, nothing-to-talk-about warblings. Also, this is not a continuous mix CD, which I didn't care for at all.This one's not too good guys and gals. I'd pass on it if I were you!"
2,wm alexander,"small small book only 20 pages or less,but in good condition...bob ross books alot bigger"
5,"It was so good, I had to run out and buy the sequel.","I didn't know much about the Amish way-of-life, but this book gives some insight on how they live. It was well written and I could hardly put it down. I am now reading the next one, ""The Confession""."
1,This heroine is stupid and selfish,"The heroine of this book is the most selfish, unsympathetic character I've read in a long time. She has this unabelievably stupid belief that when she learns something unexpected about her past, she's entitled to renege on every promise or vow she's made up until then. Her selfishness causes great pain to people around her, and she thinks she's entirely justified!I thought this book was just awful, and I honestly can't see why anybody else recommends it. The writing is amateurish at best and the storyline is silly. Ugh! Spend your money elsewhere."
5,Couldnt put it down!,This book is a wonderful story of an Amish girl who discovers a secret about her past and who she is which turns her life upside down! I completely fell in love with the characters. I was so touched by Katie's situation. I laughed and cried through the whole book! The ending was quite shocking as well! I can't wait to read book #2!
4,Engaging and exciting,"This review is for the entire trilogy. The series was great. It was hard to put down. There was exciting mystery and intrigue, with added romance. It wasn't entirely realistic, but that doesn't matter if you just want to lose yourself in a story."
4,A beautiful story sill enjoyable today.,This is the first book by Beverly Lewis I read. I enjoyed this story and was able to read all of the series quickly since I was a late comer to the series. It started me reading all of her series. I enjoyed the series and found it well written and highlights the best in a people. It is definately written by someone who has a great love for these people. I have to say that it is a simpler lifestyle that resonates with me most and I acknowledge that I prefer a slower pace. I will keep going back to this simpler life in books.
4,"No simple life, no simple choice, lies hurt",I read this book because I first saw a movie. The book is better than the movie which is usually the case. Hollywood always thinks it can write a better story than the author.I am undecided about reading the next two books in this series.I found the story line and characters believable. Katie Lapp a young 22 year old growing up Amish and than learning just days before she is to marry that she is adopted. I have known persons in really life in that situation. It is always devastating to learn you have been lied to your entire life. Honesty is always best in adoptions. She does not handle the news well and makes many mistakes in judgement.
3,Disappointing Ending,"When I pick up a book like this, I am looking for good ""light"" reading to give me a bit of escape and hopefully learn a little. However, I repeatedly find that trilogies of this nature use a ""hook"" at the end of the story to get you to read the next book. In my opinion, a book (even the first book of a trilogy) should come to some sort of closure at the end. The reader should be drawn to read the next book soley because he/she has become attached to the people and places in the book and wants to find out more about them, NOT because of some gimmick the author created to keep people guessing. But this book leaves the reader hanging. I simply did not want to read through two more books to find out how this story ended."
3,The Shunning,The book was great until the end. What a disappointment. I can't believe it went that far and then no closure. It was like getting to Disney World and being told they were closed for renovations. I'm still shaking my head.
1,Unfinished Book,"This book was enjoyable for a light read, the descriptions of the ""Plain People's"" lifestyle were interesting, but I'm giving it only one star since the book ends abruptly, with no resolution to the plot lines. I'm assuming that this is a way of enticing readers to buy the next two books, much in the style of the old cliffhanger movie series, but I found it very duplicitous."
4,sehr gut,I love this. It's a really good book. I find Katie's struggle to be believable. I also like the characters. The plot is wonderful with its twists and turns.
2,I tried reading this but could not get into it,I am not used to reading books set in Amish settings but after reading a hand fill I decided to get this novel because it was on a deep clearance. I tried to get into this book but just could not.
3,Good but hard to read,"This book was recommended to me since I love to read about the Amish. It was okay, kinda slow and hard to read with the Amish dialect. I found myself skipping ahead. I'm not sure I will read any more of this author's books."
5,One of the best books I have read all year!,"I read The Shunning about two months ago. I liked it so much, I just had to buy it so that I could let my friends read it. I would(and do!) strongly recommend this book to anyone who has or has not read books about the Amish before. I am reading The Confesion now. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read The Shunning, but I do have to say that I think it would be impossible to only read The Shunning, and not The Confession. I have read about twenty Amish fiction boks, and The Shunning tops them all! Thank you, Mrs. Lewis!!!!!!"
2,Predictable & Slow Paced Story,"This was a free download for Kindle that I read one afternoon. It was a quick and easy read that started out rather pleasantly interesting, but it I had a hard time staying interested since the story dragged. It is a Christian fiction book and I liked the way the religious themes were developed and explored. However, I was rather disappointed when the book ended in a fashion that just set-up for the next book. (Which I will not be downloading & reading.)The book's pace was slow thus it ended right when you were thinking things would pick-up. I can't say much about the ending without giving it away, but I will say that chances are good you will be able to predict the ending easily as you read through the chapters. Even though there wasn't anything really wrong with the book, I rated it low because of the predictability and extremely slow pace."
3,good read great price!,"Story started off kinda slow, but got better in the middle and made you want more in the end. I wondered if there was a follow up book and there is, but you have to pay for it. I got this one on my kindle for free."
4,Emotional. Flowing read.,"It was lovely but oftentimes sad and upsetting. I felt so sorry for Katie and the way she was treated by the Hollow people was upsetting. I also felt her own parents were hypocrites and unsympathetic, especially Katie's 'Dat'.Very well-written story and easy to read."
5,Excellant!!!!!!,This book is really good. It was about a girl named Katie who found out she wasn't really Amish and left the Amish to find her real Mom.
1,Trite and Predictable -Shun It..........Reviewer: Sucker For Freebies,"One star for the background material on Amish life, the reason I wanted to read this book, although some of the reviewers have said the material wasn't accurate. Still, you got the flavor of what Amish life might be like.As for the plot itself, it was pretty transparent from the start. I don't even need to read book 2 or 3 of the trilogy to predict how it will turn out. Bad, especially for a Y. A. audience. Lewis should have more respect for her readers. I wouldn't let my students read this stuff without a strong warning. Even for free, this wasn't worth the time."
3,Middle of the Road...,"I have read some other books by Beverly Lewis and I am drawn to fiction about the Amish anyway. Oh, and this was free on the Kindle so I was willing to read a few pages to test it out. I found myself quickly finishing the book, though it was predictable and rather slow-paced. I was disappointed that the book really cannot be satisfying as a stand-alone read, it was clearly incomplete and one would presumably move on to the next book. I won't be, for now, but maybe someday if it is free again for the Kindle, I'd be happy to follow up with Katie, Dan and the others to find out what happens next. And if that never happens, I won't be wondering much about what I am missing out on."
2,Second Chances is One Chance Too Many,"I purchased this DVD so I could enjoy this early '90s program again -- oops! The 4-DVD package has only about 8 episodes of the original program as it was broadcast and the rest are episodes of a spin-off of Second Chances. Most of the episodes of the original show were fun to watch, but I was disappointed that most of the original characters disappear about halfway through the series with little, if any, explanation. J-Lo is in all 16 episodes and as enchanting as she is, she alone could not carry the story lines created for the other characters. Speaking of story lines, it seemed as if the writers gave up about half way through and phoned it in for the rest of the program. Second Chances had plenty of promise and the plot lines could have been concluded in a variety of ways, but the only direction the producers took this show was down-down-down."
5,Great!,I love this book! I'm very satisfied with all its contents and I've even put some of the ideas into work.
3,Basic but useful,"I was looking for more original ideas, not just basic knowledge. It's a good book for a young person with their first ever apt or flat, but it's really quite basic."
1,Terrible,"This book is terrible. Save your money. There are no new or interesting organizational ideas in this book. If you have a lick of common sense, you don't need it!!!!!"
3,Ideas not Actions,"This book is full of beautiful pictures of organized homes. There are a lot of great ideas, but very little instruction on how to actually organize your house or cut clutter. A good book for someone who is trying to make their home more efficient and nice looking, but does not have a clutter or cleaning problem."
2,Buy the Magazine,"The magazine has more detailed information about how to implement great ideas. I bought the book because I love the magazine, but the only thing better about the book is that it doesn't have ads. Although, one could say that the resource section in the back is one big ad, and even it doesn't correspond the company with the tips in the book. There is also no index.Spend the money, you would have spent on the book on getting and/or renewing your subscription to the magazine, it's superb. The book is only mediocre at best."
2,Nice pictures....,"As in the magazine, the photographs are gorgeous. Actually, I recognize some of the photos from past magazines, so maybe if you've had a Real Simple subscription for a while you might not even get anything out of the visuals. As for information, it's pretty worthless. There is hardly any text at all, as you would see if you could flip through the book. Some of the pictures are of interesting organizing solutions, but many of the photos don't even have captions, so an interesting way to store jewelry, for example, is shown to you but not explained. It would make a nice coffeetable book, but don't buy this if you are actually looking for some serious information."
2,Proportions not ideal for ferrets,"Lixit (and one or two almost identical knock-offs) have the ferret dish market pretty well tied up, and a locking dish is a definite must for ferrets, but I wish they'd tailor more than just the packaging to the actual animal! These dishes are too tall for ferrets- especially when mounted in higher-end ferret cages that have trays on each level. Between the rims on the trays, the lock underneath the dish, and the depth of the dish itself, the top sits several inches above where the ferret's head would naturally be. These dishes should be wider and half as deep. THEN they'd be ""Ferret Dishes""!For a better proportion (and a nicer stainless steel finish) look at the 16 or 20 oz Coop Cup. When the ring is mounted upside down they work great for ferrets!"
5,Excellent! Classic!,Every child should have this book experience. Its a mainstay in our little ones library.
5,1 is One,"A classically illustrated Caldecott Honor Book counts to twenty in rhyming short sentences. The author notes, ""There will...always be children who must learn to count. Teach them also to enjoy the process and to count those things that are important to them,"" and she does."
4,Beautiful,"This book was great. I read it to my cousin's children ages 6-8. The illustrations are beautiful. The children liked looking at the pictures which are very detailed and there is something new to find each time you look. I loved that not only does the book show the number (1,2,3) but it is also in text (one,two,three). We also referred to the pictures for a visual aid on what a group of that number would look like. Not only will children learn the numbers in the numeral and text for up to the number twenty, but they will also extend their vocabulary."
3,Beautiful but unfortunately arrived damaged,The tile insert was cracked when it arrived. It was packaged well so I was surprised to see the crack. I returned the item for a refund and purchased a similar item at a local store.
4,One Of The 70's Best Live Albums,"All The Worlds A Stage captures Rush during their most consistent period. Along with Kiss 'Alive',BOC's 'On Your Feet...',it represents what a real concert was in this golden age of arena rock.For a test,put on some of their later output like Test For Echo,Roll The Bones or Presto (3 worst Rush albums)then play this and compare how far they've strayed from what originally put them on the map. If they had come out in any era with material as weak as those records,I doubt anyone would have cared to write about them today.These are more than just songs. They are classic pieces that remain in my head forever,every last note.It's a shame that they've turned their back on playing some of their greatest music in concert,and even believe some of this is embarassing ."
5,Well thought-out production.,"I became a Rush fan about 1979, just post-Hemispheres. I have very much enjoyed their virtuosic music, and how it has changed with the times over the years, no, decades. This live album well represents their early years. All of the first four albums color this compilation. My only wish is that they could have included one more song from 'Caress of Steel,' since two songs don't quite seem enough for representation. Nevertheless, the album contains plenty of color in the mix of all four of their first studio albums. The variety of photos of the band help top off the visual aspect of this album. If you don't have it, I say buy it!"
5,All The Worlds a Stage,"In 1976 I went to Tower Records and bought this album. The double vinyl album. In Febuary of 1977, I went to the Arogon Ballroom and saw this exact same show. They were here in late 1976 and returned to Chicago in early 1977. Let me tell you, this album defintly shows the raw talent and skill of these three musicans. Just to see Neil Pert and the drum solo, which by the way was a new sight and sound of playing drums at that time. Geddy and watching him use all four fingers to play the bass guitar. And Alex Lifeson what a guitar player. Everytime I listen to this album, I will always remember that concert. This will be my third disc owning this album. If you really like Rush, then you must own this live album. This is early Rush just begining to hit their prime."
4,The First Live Rush,"Rush has about 5 amazing live albums, and of course this is one of them. The flaw with this is, it's before the 'A Farewell to Kings' and all the cds that follow it.You can look forward to a butchered 2112, a Bastille Day, and By-Tor etc all live. But pick up 'Exit... Stage Left' first!"
4,Great Live Album But Should Have Waited,this is an great album but it has the old rush sound it would have been better if they would have waited to after the release of signals so the could have Tom Sawyer Subdivisions ect... on there 2
2,Average live set,"This is generally considered an accurate document of what Rush sounded like in the mid-70s. The set list is essentially a best-of from their first four albums. Sound quality is actually quite decent as long as you don't expect the studio-doctored slickness of later live albums. Spirited performances of ""2112"" and ""What You're Doing"" are standouts. But for some reason, the rest of the music doesn't really click. ""By-Tor and the Snowdog"" runs far, far too long and most of the other tunes don't offer enough to distinguish themselves from superior studio versions. This one is for completists and hardcore fans of the band's early period."
4,4.5 stars- Better than I remembered,"Just recently I bought ""All The Worlds A Stage"" for the first time on cd. At first I didn't like it very much because it sounded pretty raw when compared to the smoother EXIT STAGE LEFT. I think with the release of EXIT they were playing better because they had been doing about 250 shows a year for quite a few years and they were maturing as live musicians, but still, this first live album shows them more raw and energetic, so it's good to have both in your possession. It sounds much better to me than when I first heard it in 1981. This remaster sounds quite a bit better than the vinyl album did (which is something that I can't say about all rock albums). If you don't have this live album, but have a lot of the studio albums, don't hesitate in aquiring this first Rush live album."
5,"Along with the Robin Trower Band, best rock trio ever!","A favorite of mine for many, many years. I remember seeing Rush in the summer of 1979... my very first rock concert. I was stunned by their power and the sound the three of them made. ""All the World's a Stage"" was recorded when Rush was on the road promoting their ""new"" album, 2112. You could tell they had been working hard to get the songs as tight and disciplined as they sounded on the album itself. By-Tor and the Snow Dog is probably my favorite recorded live song, by any group. And I remember seeing it performed live in its entirety in that 1979 show I saw. I was proud to be a huge Rush fan before they really made it big in '81 with Moving Pictures. By-Tor was always the song I'd play to my non-believing friends when I told them what a great band Rush was. Phenomenal drumming and bass playing. This is the best live Rush album in their catalog. I haven't heard any bootlegs, but this is the best of the ones in their official catalog. Enjoy it!"
4,"1st stage ends, hinting of the next.","Rush's first chapter is always interesting to me. They started out like a heavy-metal, blues type band, "" A baby Zeppelin"" as someone quoted. Rush let their original drummer go. Even as a devoted Rush fan and amateur drummer, I still never heard the official reason why he left the band. However, Neil entered the picture. Many styles were covered over the next couple of albums. Finally, almost broke and written off, they created 2112. A new life, new success, and new direction. I believe that "" All the World's A Stage "" is a culmination of all that happened to them. While Rush were playing their hearts out and enjoying their success, you can almost hear them evolving musically on this CD. Hints of whats to come is on display. This CD is enjoyable to listen to, even though its not ranked as one of Rush's better live efforts. Its a great way to end a chapter, and move on to the next."
4,FOR ALL DRUMMERS,"If you are a drummer, or aspiring to be one, this album IS A MUST. Mr Peart's fills and speed are inspiring. His solo on ""Working Man""/""Finding my Way"" is a piece of art. His speed on the double bass is hard to match."
4,2nd only to Exit stage left,How can one band make some of the best music ever and then produce some of the worst music i have ever heard. This album represents the good early stuff.
3,Pretty good live album.,"This is a decent live album from Rush. I don't listen to All the World's a Stage often, but I still have respect for it. They sound pretty energetic and play well. Favorite songs are ""Bastille Day,"" ""Fly by Night,"" ""2112,"" and ""Finding My Way."" The rest of the live tracks are not bad. Worth a listen."
4,"A REAL live recording---no digita/re-do, clean-up job here.","Phenomenal live performance! I saw this same tour in 1977,with UFO featuring Michael Schenker opening up. Nearly 4 hours of jaw-dropping music,and I was a RUSH fan for life when I left that night. While they have done albums that are musically all over the place,throughout the years,this one represents them at the moment of ""breaking out"" and proving themselves to the world. I really feel no RUSH collection is complete without this recording. It's an important part of the '70's history.Oh,yeah--it's also fun as hell to listen to!!!!"
5,My first concert,"An old buddy invited me to a rock cocert at the San Diego Sports Arena, it was my first concert, it was powerful, it was RUSH, and it was two weeks before the release of A FAREWELL TO KINGS album. Raw unadulterated rock""n""roll is what I wanted to hear, and that is what I got, and that is what you will get when you buy RUSH'S, ALL THE WORLDS A STAGE CD, so buy it now, turn it up, and let history melt into your future..."
4,rush in the raw...,"this album is classic rush... if you are a true rush fan! I gave it 4 stars instead of five due to the sound quality of the recording. Even in its enhanced digital remastered state, the quality is lacking but this is 70's live albums true to form. If you are a rush fan of the moving pictures album on up to different stages live.. this album may not be your cup of tea.. Highlights from this album are the full version of 2112, in the mood, fly by night, and finding my way/ working man...( the drum solo..listen to pick out rhythmic sections peart uses in all his solo's) All in all its a gem... in the rough... i would recommend this album to the true fan of rush"
4,Rush at it's finest.,"Have to admit that this is the first Rush album I bought so I'm biased to their ""live"" sound. Their studio albums up 'til them were all very good and getting better (then the 80's happened)!""Live"" 2112 is great, all the boring stuff is omitted. ""Working Man/Finding My Way"" and ""In The End"" sound like a band making it's last attempt at stardom- and succeeding! There's a lot of spontaneity you would'nt expect from such a precision oriented band- something you wont find on ""Exit Stage Left"" either. After ""Permanant Waves"" I kinda lost touch with Rush but they still manage to put some good stuff out- unfortunately, never like this one!"
3,Decent considering the material.,"I'm a serious Rush fan, but this album is kind of hit or miss. The version of ""Working Man/Finding My Way"" is great as are a few others, but the production is weak and some song choices are odd. Considering that they only had four albums under their belt, it is understandable. If you are on the fence at all, I would err on the side of not buying and pick up ""Exit Stage Left"" or ""Three Stages"" instead."
3,over charge shipping rates,I will not recommend Amazon.con to anyone as thge productds are ok but the shipping charges are 75 to 800 % of the value of the articles I ordered yes in one case the items were .91 cents each x 12 items and the postage charged was $83.00 and change.
3,to slow,"In trying to teach students algebra, I tried to use this book to teach them from, but I found that all the concepts were introduced at what is seemingly high school level. I think that a moderate high school student (with some curiosity) could teach himself the basics of algebra with this book. As an undergraduate text, though, it is way too slow and way too elementary."
2,only for brainiacs,"This book has some nice proofs in it (though, disappointingly, many key results are ""left as an exercise""), and some nice diagrams as well, but it is way too light on methodology. Unless you're blessed with brilliance, inpiration, and limitless free time, avoid this book. I've read many chapters two or three times over and still cannot apply what I've learned to the problems at the end of the chapter. In that respect, this book fails as a student textbook. It is concise enough to serve as a reference, but doesn't offer much for someone who is genuninely interested in the subject but doesn't already know everything."
5,Thank you!,Book arrived in excellent condition and very timely manner. Will definitely check out for further textbook purchases.
3,"1/2"" is hard to find","I can't find 1/2"" rod in local hardware stores, only on-line shops. It works OK to replace the builder installed fan."
3,"Brushed Nickel Downrod 24"" X 1/2""","Be very wary when purchasing this item. All the fans I have ever seen and installed use a 3/4"" downrod. Because I have never seen another size I didn't even think when purchasing this item to check for diameter. If you use a standard 1"" outer diameter downrod this will not fit. With that being said the product was exactly as it stated. Just check to make sure it is what you need!"
5,Chrome Ceiling Fan Downrod,"I needed a 3/4 inch CHROME (hard to find this finish) ceiling fan downrod that extends 24 inches from ceiling. I purchased a beautiful ceiling fan/light at our local hardware store, but they did not carry the downrod needed for my space. So, I turned to Amazon.com and there were several to choose from! It shipped right away and matches the chrome perfectly! Thanks Amazon for providing those hard to find items and great service!"
3,Ultimately unstaisfying,"I read this book as part of a discussion group and frankly, I would not have finished it if I did not plan to be discussing it. The characteriation is very well done but the book as a whole, left me flat. Perhaps the way the reader is led from one man's perpective to the other on a number of events made me anticipate a revelation of some sort. The revelation never comes and I was left thinking, ""Interesting but.??.."""
3,Did I miss something?,"Everyone talks about this book as some struggle of humanity to makes its own expressions in the face of secrets and lies. Instead, I found a depressingly banal group of insights, from an essentially and elementally fragmented and isolated group of so-called friends. They exchange a series of aphorisms as if these trite little snippets mean something, all the while deepening their own alienations from each other and from their own feelings. Their sole response then is to do their duty--and indeed they do. The book ends with no surprise--and I am left wondering whether indeed any action in such a trite and hackneyed world, glib to the core, has any inherent meaning outside its adherence to some last and final order."
2,A let down,"I could not get truly involved in this book. It was a disappointment for me, and I was looking forward to reading his works because of many positive reviews that I had read."
3,"I had high expectations, but something was missing.","I had very high expectations when I purchased Last Orders. It seemed to hold the promise of revealing rare human insight, as told by a master storyteller, not withstanding the fact it won the Booker Prize.I found keeping track of all the charcters, their nicknames and the short chapters somewhat confusing at times. It didn't sustain my attention.However, it does have its good points. All told, it is a good, not a great story. The characters are deeply drawn, you do care about them, and the dialogue is authentic blue collar London, which I enjoyed.Although I was sorely disappointed by Last Orders, I believe it deserves a second read."
3,Technically good but left me unsatisfied,I bought this book to read on a long plane trip but soon put it down in favour of another book. Having won the Booker Prize I thought it would be a good read. While it's technically very well written I found the characters in the novel did nothing for me. In fact I became so confused about who was who I had to draw up a list of who everyone was - and there aren't that many characters! If you enjoyed the film Secrets and Lies then you'll like this book - and vice versa
2,"It's supposed to be such a good book, but...","It just never captured my interest. Many reviewers said the characters and situations were funny and authentic. Taking the garbage out is an authentic actitity, too; but terribly uninteresting. What is funny about this group of pathetically boring characters and their box of ashes? I forced myself to finish this book, but found it a great disappointment. I agree with the Boston Review's comments. It is a banal book."
3,Are people's lives really this complicated?,"Four blokes. One of them's just died. The other three and the dead man's son (kind of) are charged with driving the ashes from London to Margate, and scattering them into the sea. Sounds like the premise of a fairly simple tale - instead it's the foundation for a lengthy bout of philosophical reflection through the eyes/minds/voices of the surviving characters. It's all beautifully written, all intelligently observed - which for me is the problem. Are four typical geezers from East London really this eloquent? Do they really struggle quite so painfully with their consciences? Or would they in real life be sitting down the pub saying ""Cor, makes you think, dunnit?"""
2,Working Class Canterbury Tales?,I found the constant change from character to character and from time frame to time frame made the story difficult to get into. Whatever humor there was in this story escapes me. What a very sad commentary on the family relationships of the characters. Only two seemed to have any satisfaction in their lives. Depressing at best. The fact that I needed to read this for a book club discussion is the only thing that caused me to persevere to the end.
2,Not Booker Prize material,"This novel has an interesting structure, but it takes so long to get the cast of characters straight that I kept losing my concentration. Determined to find out why the Booker prize was awarded, I ploughed through. The novel does come together in the end, but I would not have finished the book had it not been awarded the Booker Prize."
1,Disappointment on the way to the shore...,"This book was a disappointment. The author repeated, 'he said' and 'she said' until I thought I'd scream. I'm not sure how else the author could handle dialogue when there are so few characters, but it seems he could have come up with something creative. Trying to give the book/story a chance I watched the movie on TV (should say I tried to watch the movie) and it was equally boring and pointless. Couldn't finish the book or the movie. Gave the book one star just for the work that must go into writing a novel. The cover states 'Winner of the Booker Prize' pleeeeeeze, the judges must have drank or smoked too much of something...There are so many wonderful reads out there, don't waste your time on this one."
3,brilliant disappointment,"I'm with the critics. It's as if Swift deliberately made this book difficult. While there are plenty of lines that hit you right between the eyes, far far fewer than in the dazzling Waterland. It's worth reading, but I recommend at top speed, with no stopping and no looking back (just like life...)"
3,A marvelous premise imperfectly executed,"Graham Swift's novel Last Orders has a marvelous premise: a group of elderly gentlemen -- all veterans of the Second World War -- travel from London to the sea to scatter the ashes of a recently deceased comrade. The dearly departed's son, a car dealer, is also with them. On the way, they reflect on their lives, wives, triumphs and disappointments. At one point, two of the men get into a fight. All of this is meant to be both funny (it is) and poignant (it is, sometimes). Swift's novel has received marvelous reviews, so I started it with great anticipation when it became available at our local library. I must disagree with the universal critical acclaim. To me, Swift just misses in many of his scenes (his characters, in contrast, are gems). As I read, I kept thinking, ""this is supposed to be a wonderful book, yet my mind keeps wandering; what's wrong with me?"""
3,Pleasant and quiet,"At first I really liked the book as I thought it was a black comedy somewhat like ""As I Lay Dying"" but in the end I felt that it didn't measure up to its billing. Although pleasant and readable, it just doesn't have enough to it to be memorable. It would make an entertaining movie of the ""Ned Devine"" type, but I don't think it would win any awards as there's nothing to impel the plot forward other than the journey which becomes a bit tiresome. There are some good scenes, but all in all it seems on the tame side."
2,Who's on 1st?,The theme of this book intrigued me but I found it very choppy and confusing. The author should have provided a scorecard to make it easier to sort out the characters. It was just too much work
4,Battery charge checker,Newly charged batteries need a load to reduce the surface charge and give a true battery health reading. This tester works great as advertised
5,Battery tester,"I was using tester like this (maybe exact the same tester) for years. It proved to be reliable, simple and effective in troubleshooting battery's problem. I bought this one for personal use, and this one saved me a lot of time and money already."
1,Quality,The item is cheaply made and actually does not measure accurately and correctly. My item measure with 1v or 1.5v in some instances lower than actual voltage.
4,Actron CP7612,"I purchased this load tester a month or so ago to test the batteries in my boat. It works fine. I have had friends that run service stations and they use the same product, but paid way more than I did. I would reccomend this to anyone wanting a reliable tester."
5,From the Heart.....,"<lights up Monetecristo #2>This book is the equivalant of playing Russian Roulette with a ""Full Clip"".DS tells it like it is. Straight from the heart.**True to the Game, as long as blood is blue in my vein**ND ------> Comin soon..."
4,Bauhaus before bauhaus,"If ever there was a collection of artefacts that proves the sayings ""Less is more"" and ""God is in the details"" then it has to be the collection of archictectural jewels found here in this beautifully illustrated overview of early Islamic architecture.It shows the domination of geometric art and form, light and space that typifies the brilliance of early Islamic architecture.It's a great coffee table book, and something to inspire, educate and inform as well as to soothe, relax and dream of.regards,martyn_jones@iniciativas.com"
4,Nice for travelers and students,I have been to most of the counties which have monuments described in this book. It is nice to have some copies from it when you are visiting any site and read it there. You will understand much more than your traveling guide can inform you. Also it is good for student who study Islamic culture and history
3,not enough sex- and I am a woman!,"The Emanualle series is unique in that it is sensual and sexual. It reaches the ladies in the audience WITHOUT being offensive!This one seemed far too concerned with the safe sex concerns of the actors. It was Emanuelle- almost- reimbraces- secondary viginity.Of the ones I have seen in this series, this one is the worst. I suggest you try Emanuelle 1 or 2! Enjoy!!"
2,Monique,"See that name? Pretty much the only reason to watch this movie. If you loved this Pet, then this is another excuse to see her, naked of course.Starts in Cannes where she is stripped naked by her fans & runs thru the town to the marina where she catches a boat to safety. Her savior is a multi-millionaire who tries to save her from herself. She rebels & ends up in the Middle East? with some sheik who kills anyone who talks to her & tries to make her part of his really ugly harem. She escapes with the help of some guy who turns out to be hired by the millionaire. Story is incredibly stupid. Several of the locales seem to be ""umm, I'm tired, can we just shoot here?"" while the rest are to show the extravagance of Emmanuelle's good fortune. The editors got lazy (or maybe they were doing the best with what they had) and re-used one scene several times.Overall, not very good. If you just want to remember your youthful crush, then buy it."
2,Rush's weakest album,"I'm surprised to see all these well-meaning reviews here, because this album is generally considered as one of Rush's weakest. Rush are one of the few bands who have a very loyal following, but anyone who listens with an open ear notices that ""Grace.."" and the other two mid-'80s albums are claptrap and sound oldfashioned today with their synths- and effects overload. The songs on this album are cold and hectic, the production is sterile, and the band doesn't rock but performs ""soundscapes"". Sorry, but would you like this album if any other band had served it?"
2,What happened?,"I suppose after several high quality, and in some cases classic albums, the band had to hit a rocky patch. 'Grace Under Pressure' was the beginning of this. Tracks like 'Red Lenses' and 'Red Sector A' would be instantly forgettable if they weren't so dire! The lyrics in both are terrible, what does ""I must help my mother stand up straight"" mean exactly? The opening keyboard sound of ""Between the wheels"" is just awful! And how many, er, times is the word ""time"" used in the opening 2 verses? Two tracks feature no bass guitar at all, using a synth-bass instead, which is not what Geddy Lee is about, as he has been the 'father' of the instrument for so long. Highlights are ""Kid Gloves"" and ""The Enemy Within"", the rest is not worth the time taken to listen to it. The band didn't properly recover from this until 1991's excellent ""Roll the Bones"". Sorry, unless you're a diehard Rushhead, give this one a miss."
2,Rushing Into The 80's,"Well, Rush WAS a great combo of both progressive and hard rock in their heyday. Signals was a slight downturn from Moving Pictures,but Grace Under Pressure slides further. In the 80's (worst musical decade thank you very much)everyone was obliged to make their stinky ""robot man"" album full of synthesizers and sci-fi themes. It got overdone to death and this album is no exception. Synths (sequenced in live shows)take over leaving Rush not even sounding like a power (what power from here on ?)trio at all; a trend that continued for many a dull album. However I always liked ""Kid Gloves"";it has great tricky time changes and maybe Lifeson's best guitar solo ever. Overall, not their absolute worst (Roll The Bones is a few down the line),not the best,not recommended."
2,What happened?,"Rush for me made the most brilliant and inspirational music ever heard between 1976-82, but it was inevitable that the bubble would eventually burst. 'Pressure' is Rush's weakest album since the Led Zeppelin-esque days of the mid 70's, apart from 'Kid Gloves' and 'Enemy Within' the whole album lacks the passion and sheer excitement of the '2112' to 'Signals' era. Keyboards played TOO much of a part on this album, and the bass and guitars were pushed further into the background. Successor 'Powerwindows' wasn't much better, and the trio didn't really recover from this until 1991's excellent 'Roll the Bones'. I suppose a few duff records out of more than 20 ain't so bad though..."
4,Progressive Pop,"I really like Grace Under Pressure, besides by this time Rush is making a kind of progressive pop music. The early Rush days were filled with progressive heavy metal, and Grace Under Pressure is almost pop, but i like this Pop Rush. They got great lyrics, and if you like Rush you probably will like Grace Under Pressure."
4,Yep!,"Some people say that this is one of the most difficult albums that Rush has ever made. However, I liked it when I heard it for the first time. ""Distant Early Warning"" and ""Red Sector A"" are classic Rush songs. Also the part one of Fear which is ""The Enemy Within"" is absolutly amazing. The other parts of Fear that had been released before this album are Witch Hunt (part III) {in Moving Pictures} and The Weapon (part II) {in Signals}. The keyboards especially very powerful in these songs. The only song I don't like so much is ""Red Lenses"" which has it moments but I find it too poppy for me. Well, a great album from Rush.Stars: Red Sector A, The Enemy Within, Distant Early Warning"
4,"pretty good song collection on here, fairly good overall","I really like a few of the songs on here, like ""red sector A"" and ""between the wheels"" and ""afterimage,"" and the rest of the songs are all right also. I am surpised I actually like this cd, it is generally thought of as one of their weaker ones. But I think it holds up pretty well, it has a few classic Rush tunes on it. Some of the songs, like ""distant early warning,"" are kind of keyboard corny because they have kind of and awkward sound and structure, but there is nothing terrible here. The best thing you can do is cull the good stuff out of each Rush album and make a mix, because no truly complete greatest hits set has yet been released. And there are several songs on here that are entirely worthy (in fact, necissary) of being included on a set such as that."
4,googleoid,"I am listening to Xanadu and I typed in to google ""there was a time when i wished that all music was like this atmospheric and yet concrete"" and what pops up... GUP. 4 stars!"
5,Did you see the Grace Under Pressure tour?,"Accompanying this disc, the live show here featured more RED than I thought was possible to absorb in our relatively small (~12,000 seat) Tucson Convention Center arena. I believe the album was played in it's entirety, and the fact that it WAS 1984 signaled the Distant Early Warning of things to come globally which most of us could not have imagined then in a seemingly ""innocent age."" My Grace Under Pressure lp has grooves that are, possibly, even more worn than any other RUSH lp in my collection. I'm glad that the band has retained use of the stylish mannequin skull at their concerts to the present day. And I agree with the other reviews about the style of playing exhibited by all the band members, on this disc. I think this collection of songs was one of RUSH's greatest accomplishments in the 1980's."
2,Martha Quinn's Revenge,"This CD sounds like it is made up of leftover material that Diddn't make it on to the ""Moveing Pictures"" and ""Signals"" Albums.The First track ""Distant Early Warning"" is a good song but It sounds out of place on this record.Most of the songs sound like an 80s ""flashback."" ""the Enemy Within"" is another gem but thats about it.THis CD sounds like alot of Bands from the 80's.THe CD is Over produced and Over rated.Pick up ""2112"" ""Counterparts"" or ""Farwell to kings"" they are alot better than this."
2,Not their finest Hour,"I am a huge Rush fan, and have been for years. I can't recommend this CD however unless you have ALL the others. This is in my opinion one of the worst CDs they ever produced. The musicianship is tame, and the subject matter is tired after being rehashed from their previous (much better) works. I would recommend 'Signals' (a masterpiece), '2112', 'Hemispheres', 'A farewell to Kings', 'Moving Pictures', 'Permanent Waves' (another masterpiece), or even their 'best of' before this one. The only time I could recommend this is if you need the complete collection, as this CD is important in that it is a transition for them as a band from their 2nd to 3rd ""reincarnation"" of their music. Overall though, not a good CD."
2,Oh God....not this one.....please.,"Every band is allowed one aberration in their catalogue, and I suppose a back catalogue the size of the Rush one could be granted two. Along with ""Exit, Stage Left"" this is probably the most deeply horrible experience ever to carry the Rush name, albeit for totally different reasons. While ""ESL"" is simply fatuous, ""Grace Under Pressure"" is intensely annoying for its failure to exploit the potential within it.Lyrically it is certainly no worse than the albums which preceded or succeeded it (although the laughably heavy-handed ""Red Sector A"" should perhaps be singled out for special abuse). Musically, however, it could be Britney Speares: lightweight pop, the music undermining the lyrics rather than reinforcing them. Quite how the same team that wrote ""2112"", ""Ghost of a chance"" and ""Vertigo"" could be responsible for this is still a mystery."
2,Downward Trend,"""Grace"" represented the first of several disappointing records by this immensly talented trio. For some reason, the group decided to abandon the guitar first, keyboards second musical approach that had proven so successful with ""Permanant Waves,"" ""Moving Pictures,"" and ""Signals."" The result is a bloated excess of keyboards, electronic drums, and an understated Alex Lifeson.Only two good tunes here...""Kid Gloves,"" and ""Red Sector A."" You can have the rest. I'd give this disc a 1 1/2 star if I could.They would hit rock bottom with ""Power Windows."""
4,great work again by Rush,"I just bought this album a few days ago.AMAZING!I am a huge rush fan i especially like there 70's stuff.GRACE UNDER PRESSURE surprised me.I was only 2 when this came out and I'm just now listening to it.It's great,i love all there stuff.I'm only 17 and I guess I'm in the wrong generation but I'm so impressed with a 3-man band that hangs around for over 20 years!I recomend this to rush fans and 80's lovers!Great overall album"
5,It talks to me.,"I was 20 years old when this album came out. I went to the tour. This album spoke to me then when I had a lot of problems. It still speaks to me because it is a timeless work. This one album tells the truth about the human condition. It is the ultimate tale of defeat, of love in a real, not passionate sense, of the struggle of mankind. I love this album because it is the album of the true nature of things. Rush is a band that sings about thingsss that are not fluff. this is one of their more direct, but not dark, albums. One has to note that, ""Distance Early Warning"" was recorded at the peak of the Cold War and that the concerns then are radically differentnow, but the song is still relevant. On the otherhand, ""Kid Gloves"" described the problems of youth then, while today, it's description of the problems with young people is more relevant today. The ""Body Electric"" describes us all on any given day. (1001001 is in binary code the ""I"".)"
3,A good album.,"I've always liked Grace under Pressure. I listened to it quite a bit when I first got it several years ago. I still don't mind listening to it sometimes. I like the direction that Rush took with this album--the increased use of synthesizers was a good idea. The album's musicianship isn't disappointing. The guitar playing and synthesizer playing complement each other well. I don't think that either takes away from the other. Songs I like the most are ""Distant Early Warning,"" ""Afterimage,"" and ""Red Sector A."" The rest of the tracks aren't bad, either. There is one thing that I have always noticed about Grace under Pressure, though--the atmosphere of the album is quite chilly. I don't consider that to be a negative aspect. Grace under Pressure is a good album. It's interesting and progressive. Geddy Lee does well with the vocals, also. Worth a listen."
3,"Some very good, some just good and some ordinary songs","Here's my choice of very good songs, ""Distant early warning"", ""Red Sector A"", ""The ennemy within"" and """"The body electric"".The good songs would be ""Red lens"" and ""Betweeen the wheels""The ordinary songs are ""Afterimage"" and ""Kid gloves""i give it a three stars, which is reflecting a good album for me, but not a great one."
2,Rush's classic period ends,"I would give every Rush album up to this point five stars ending with Signals. The band parted ways with their producer Terry Brown and embraced a keyboard dominated sound on this album, abandoning their hard rock past and thus totally alienating me as a die hard fan. When I first bought this album in 1984 I could'nt believe it was the same band. For anybody who wants to hear Rush at their peak, any of the albums from the self titled debut up to Signals will leave you amazed at the awesome musicianship of Geddy, Alex, and Neil."
3,Some interesting imagery,"I like this album somewhat. Since it's my only Rush album, I can't say too much about how thought the vocals should be louder, but I think the Synth lines make it a bit cluttered sounding and as I said the vocals kind of sink into the background a bit.But the instrumental imagery is great, it's good when a band uses synthesisers in a thoughtful way. I like the fourth song because is has a bit fo a throwback to early-60's kinxd of music. They album has a dark, almost heavy atmosphere from beginning to end. It's a good listen."
3,Rush - 'Grace Under Pressure' (Mercury),"Review #149. Originally released in 1984, this was when Rush was still re-inventing themselves (I'm assuming). An era for the Canadian power trio when the young/er fans might have eaten this (then) new material up but older Rush fans, like myself were patiently waiting for them to return to their roots - like they finally did over ten years later on their 'Test For Echo' CD. Tunes here that sort of grab my interest were the over-played ""Distant Early Warning"", ""Red Sector A"", ""Kid Gloves"" (possibly the disc's best track) and ""Red Lenses"". Okay, but certainly nothing to write home about."
5,"This is Rush at their finest (yes, this includes the 70's)","If you are a 'rocker' who is put off by keyboards, don't buy this CD. If you a looking for a concept CD that displays a wide range of textures and emotions, both beautiful and terrifying, then GIVE THIS CD A CHANCE. But you will need to listen to it from beginning to end, and without interruption several times before you get the real 'feel' for this one. This CD feels like watching a some epic movie. I am suprised and glad to see that after 15 years, G/P is finally starting to get the praise it deserves!"
4,Why don't the Remasters ever have bonus tracks?,"Great CD, I had seen Rush live from their 2112 days up and through this tour. These guys just kept getting better live. I took a while for this to grow on me but ""Kid Gloves"" has to be one of the best songs they have ever done. I would have given this a 5 but just issuing the same CD that is already available with nothing new is just robbery. I don't have the most hitech sysem and my car CD player is just stock so I really don't notice all the ""remastering"" going on, sorry. This is not a very long album, under 40 minutes and the songs are so good that 9 tracks breeze by before you can hit play again on your CD player. Keyboards continue to play an ever expanding role in Rush on the album which I miss the Lifeson guitar of the 70's sorry. Still a solid Rush record."
1,Where is it?,The order for cassette tapes was made on March 8 it's now April 3. There still isn't a ETA and there doesn't seem to be any coming in the future but we haven't been told yet what the actual status is if in fact there is one. Hello??? Is there anyone there that can tell us what's going on?
5,Great tapes!,"I bought these tapes so I can listen to some of my Vinyl LPs that I don't own on CD in the car (Witch still has a cassette player) without going through the hassle of recording them onto my computer with a program like audacity and then burning them to a CD-R. To me, popping a blank in the tape deck and pressing ""Record"" is just a much easier process. Sound is quite good even though these are normal bias tapes. My local drug store still carries these so I didn't have to order from amazon(Even though amazon is cheaper) In short, they work perfectly!"
4,A Beautifully Told Story,"Barbara Delinsky paints a beautiful story, weaving together complicated human emotions and serene nature settings. Great read - wanted it to go on for a few hundred more pages. My first Delinsky, but not my last."
5,"Fantastic writing without the unnecessary ""fluff"".",Clear and concise writing. What a great book with Jack coming back to his senses and realizing what is important in life. Mainly...family. This is the first of Barbara Delinsky's books I have read and was most pleased with it. I can't wait to read another of hers!
3,very good soap opera read but poor on literary quality,as really good literary fiction this book would rate very poorly. but it is a good read if you like a soap opera type of plot with little character development but many characters and a story that moves along quite well.
4,"An engaging, heartwarming story.","I enjoyed this book so much that I was sad when it came to it's conclusion. The struggles were inteligent, the characters were quickly dear friends to me, and I especially found Rachel inspiring--she'd made choices and created a lifestyle that honored herself, something I and many of my friends are trying to learn how to do nowadays. To cliche a bit--I laughed, I cried, etc. etc. And this from a huge Stephen King fan!"
4,Suprising ... perspective!,"I think this was one of the first romance books I read that presented from his side, not hers. I found him to be a wonderful, flawed, typical man with lots of appeal and real in his reactions and reasonings ... I liked the contrast of the two daughters ... I liked his ""coming of age"" or redemption ... and I think most of all, I liked that this was a working back to something good- an epilogue that reflected life a little more realistically than meet-fall-in-love, marry, and live happy ever after. Marriage is work. Teens are work. Compromise and honesty and exposing yourself is work ... but it is life, and life most rewarding.Well done, Ms Delinsky!"
4,Sequel please!,"One of those books I couldn't put down. I picked it up quite by surprise, as it had been on my bookshelf for a while. With fall in the air, it seemed a great book to snuggle up with. Not disappointed. Now I just wish she'd write a sequel to it and carry us along through Jack And Rachel's reuniting!"
3,NOT ONE OF HER BETTER BOOKS,"This book was only OK to me. I wouldn't tell someone ""You have to read this book"". I thought it moved slow - I was constantly saying lets get on with it!! I have read other books by Barbara Delinsky and have enjoyed them - especially More Than Friends. But somehow this book didn't move me like that one did. I bought it based upon the great reviews, but was a bit disappointed. I got awfully tired of Jack rubbing lotion on his ex-wife. But it won't stop me from reading the other books of hers."
5,Hated for it to end!!,I have read several Barbara Delinsky books. I just loved this one and wish there was a follow up. You felt like you were living with and thru them. I just finished the book and had to come online and post.
2,Great book if you like to fantasize,"I've read one of Barbara Delinsky's books about eight years ago, and I was impressed. That book, A Woman Betrayed, kept me in search of an interesting book Barbara. Admittedly, Coast Road is readable, but the plot is unrealistic. Jack and Rachel's two daughters, 13 and 15 year old, had the intelligence of 3 and 5 year olds. Rachel was the one with the head injuries, but one has to wonder if Jack suffered from head injuries also. The story was told in 16 days, which seemed to be enough time for Jack to realize that he's put the love of his life on the back burner for the past six year. Grow up Jack! The only good thing about Coast Road is the fact that Delinsky keeps the reader interested in finding out whether or not Rachel wakes up."
2,Disappointed,"This was my first Barbara Delinsky book. I thought the premise was interesting, however, I thought Barbara had a problem writing from a ""male perspective."" The first 50 pages were good but the story became more unbelievable and predictable as it went on. I must admit I was even more diappointed because of the glowing reviews."
3,A story of finding truth and forgiveness!,"Several in a book group read this. We all enjoyed deeply. Kept wanting it to move a little faster, but once it we got to the end, we appreciated where the author took this book."
5,attention to detail,"I love Barbara Delinsky's writing style. Enough detail that you connect with the characters and feel like you are there with them. She also is masterful in researching the craft or job the character's engage in with detail and accuracy of their craft. I also enjoy reading about the area she writes about, so if you've been to these towns you too can picture where the story takes place."
4,Coast Road is a passionate & charming read.,"I don't usually read ""romance"" except, for somereason, this book called to me. It was a satisfyingly real &domestic read! Two kids, spanning the age of innocence to the age of suspicion, who were great until their safe normal world is bashed in, copes with their fear in their own ways. Meanwhile their estranged father comes back into their lives, one resents him making like a parent while the other accepts his return with haunting gladness. A well-wrought love story with redemption & resolution. A good read!..."
1,Targeted for middle age divorced woman seeking romance.,I fail to understand why so many readers claim this book as a real page turner while every chapter describes a man visiting his hospitalized comatosed ex-wife to rub in body lotion.
4,Another winner from Ms. Delinsky,"Barbara Delinsky is one of the most skilled authors of that genre known as ""women's fiction."" COAST ROAD again displays why she has earned her stellar reputation. This is a beautiful book, beautifully conceived, beautifully written in typical Delinsky fashion. The characters are well-fleshed and the story is gripping and fast-paced. The book, ultimately, is touching as well. For fans of Ms. Delinsky, COAST ROAD is a must-read. And for readers who have not yet sampled this author's work, COAST ROAD would be a fine place to start."
1,If you don't have anything else to read...,"I happened to read this book because it was at the beach house we rented for vacation last week. The description made the book seem interesting, but it was very one-dimensional & the characters were so stereotyped that they are not believable.For Rachel to have loved (still love) Jack so much, she found it very easy to suddenly pack up & leave him. Also, the writer should have thought out a better way to communicate for Rachel - Katherine seemed very harsh & abrasive. I also found it hard to believe that Rachel was such a loner in the city, but quite the joiner since moving to Big Sur. Nothing really flowed together right to make the story believable.If you don't have anything else to read, give it a try, but don't buy it."
3,less than satisfying effort,"I am assuming that Delinsky does more plot development in other novels than this one. While I will give her a second chance, I was disappointed by Coast Road. It seemed to focus in on the man's point of view. This isn't, in and of itself, a bad thing even for a female writer. The bad thing is that when the female character spends the majority of the book in a coma, you don't learn much about her or her motivations. Delinsky does have a vehicle for providing us with insight into this woman - through her reading group - but she doesn't take full advantage of the opportunity. In the end, all comes together with a less than beliveable fairytale quality, making you truly wonder why the two people were ever estranged to begin with. If you're new to Delinsky like me, best to try another of her novels. If you're an avid fan, you could take the plunge, but know what you're in for."
5,A Gal's Guide to Life,"From love to bring'in the cows in this book covers it. Full of the sassiest sayings and the best rules to live by, it will never let a gal down. ""Don't try and drown your sorrows- they know how to swim!"""
4,pocket paperback of cowgirl-ish one-liners,i'm sure it'll bring a smile to my friend's face for like an hour as she reads through it and then it'll sit on her shelf with a bunch of other useless but fun books.
4,Review Easy Travel Air Bed,Still holding air after almost 1 year of occasional use. Its comfortable ...but big (even deflated it has some size and weight).
5,Long Live Shirley Temple!,"For any Shirley Temple fan, this set is a very nice collectible keepsake, and it was excellent in bringing back all the warm, fuzzy feelings that inspired the childhood memories in me."
3,"Sigg Cap for Bottle top not included, Sigg Cap for Hinged Sigg top","This product is listed as a ""Mud Cap,"" and I thought it contained the entire top for the Sigg water bottle. It doesn't. Think of the mud cap as a dirt/germ cover to keep the spout you drink from (the Active bottle top) clean.The Mud top CLIPS on to the HINGE of one type of the bottle tops. The other type of cap has an O-ring part that SLIPS over the top of the bottle, then the spout you drink from screws in over it, and then the cap covers the spout. This is NOT a mud cap, but called something else and seems to get in the way when you're trying to drink from the bottle.I prefer the mud cap because it flips completely out of the way as you drink, whereas this other O-ring cap flops in your face as you drink. The only consideration: for toddlers: when they drop the Sigg bottle, the Mud cap hinge can break, whereas the floppy O-ring doesn't. For teens and adults; go with the Mud cap."
2,Crappy Cap,"The cap gets a few stars for looks but the plastic is not durable at all and the first time it dropped from my backpack it broke (compared to my Nalgene bottle that's been dropped thousands of times and never breaks).If you are going to get the bottle, I recommend getting the bottle bandit to help you hold the bottle on or get the screw top instead which looks more durable.Plus, if it does break, you have to spend about $2+a lot more for shipping to replace it."
2,Just the cap,"This is just the cap to go over a sport top. The product description is misleading - there is no screw top, there is nothing to drink from. This cap snaps onto a diferent bottle top. If you are looking for a sport-top, pick a different item."
1,its just a piece of the cap?,Very annoyed... I looked through several other listings before choosing this one because it sounded like it included the piece you screw onto the bottle-- it doesn't!
1,WHAT??,"I bought this because I thought it was a sports cap. Instead, it's somehow a cap to the cap - completely useless, as there was no way I was able to determine how to use it as a replacement for my other sports cap. Again, DIRECTIONS WOULD BE HELPFUL!!!"
2,Are You Kidding Me?,"Please just go buy the originals and skip this. It would be one thing if these were covers by other ambient artists, but this is not worth the time."
4,Pleasant and soothing,"I like the album, but I would prefer more traditional Irish music. Their style is more synthesized or augmented than acoustical. Still, it's a good string of music. I play it and their first album frequently at home, b/c my wife used them to help her relax while in labor with each of our two children."
2,"OK, But Not Wonderful","I bought this CD based on the recommendation of the reviews. Although I'd never heard this group before I was anticipating something really special and wonderful, but I find it very derivative and not original. I would suggest to anyone interested in buying this CD to try and borrow a copy and listen to it first. You might love it, you might find it so-so."
4,Well Done,"A really well thought out and well played album. If you like anything from light classical, soft jazz, or traditional celtic, you'll like this album."
3,"Nice, light New Age fare","I hate to be the only dissenting vote, but I bought this album and _Songs from a Secret Garden_ as Valentine's day gifts, based on the rave reviews. Although it's lovely, I was looking for something special, and I have to say it isn't that.Lovely, charming, and soothing, yes; special or extraordinary, no. Secret Garden is fairly average New Age music, light and airy, but not compelling or memorable in the way the best New Age is. I wouldn't have purchased it if I'd had access to sound samples at the time."
1,You'd better like fiddles,"Sadly, I purchased this CD without the aid of a sound card, but after reading reviews on the Amazon.com web page. While I don't dislike fiddles, a little goes a long way. This CD is virtually all fiddle music. I no longer own this CD and won't purchase any CD again without the benefit of listening to a sample first."
3,Average Music,"If you try the whole secret garden set, several times maybe, I would say most of the musics are pretty much similar. New Age Music yes, average in my opinion, not as what I expected from the edit review...hm...not even close."
4,"Pleasant, romantic music for the soul","As a fan of ""Secret Garden"" I have enjoyed this CD for weeks now. I fall asleep to it almost every night. It is not my very favorite, prefering the turn of the century one, but I do alternate listening to both. I am looking forward to a new album, as the recently purchsed one has mostly repeats on it.Talented musicians, composers and singers make this CD incredibly enjoyable and I do say I love it."
5,The Best Secret Garden,"Of the 4 Secret Garden CD's I have, White Stones is by far the best. It was a hard choice between White Stones and Songs from a Secret Garden, their first album. Both are exceptional with hauntingly beautiful melodies. But I still pick White Stones as their best. Was disappointed with Dawn of a New Century, and their newest album Dreamcatcher doesn't have enough new music, most of it is from ""Stones"" and ""Song"" albums, which I already have. If you want beautiful, haunting, melancholy music, get White Stones and Songs from a Secret Garden."
5,Music Which Calms My Soul,"My passion for music now includes the celtic flavor ""Secret Garden-White Stones"" CD. I have been listening to it for weeks and still enjoy every track although track 3, Hymn to Hope is my favorite. Every ""Secret Garden"" CD will soon be part of my collection. This music is perfect for the commute home after a stressful day at work."
5,Wonderful CD!!!,"The music is absolutely breathtaking and I intend to use ""Illumination"" as my wedding processional piece, however I must point out errors in the track listing:1 - Steps2 - Poeme3 - Hymn to Hope4 - First Day of Spring5 - Passacaglia6 - Reflection7 - Windancer8 - Appassionata9 - Escape10 - Sanctuary11 - Celebration12 - Home13 - Illumination"
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"Very few artist, new age or otherwise, have the emotional impact this music has on the listener. Secret Garden has provided music for the heart and soul that leaves you feeling refreshed at the end of a long day."
5,A must for all music lovers,"First it was Songs from Secret Garden and now this,White Stones. This CD makes your dreams fly. Listening to Poem or Hymn to the Spring you feel the music and how it's touches you. All my american friend bought this CD after I played it for them. One even used this music in her wedding. I am just looking forward to the next CD from Secret Garden and Rolf Loevland."
4,Creacion de Aplicaciones Multimedia con VISUAL BASIC,"Esta muy bien explicado, la informacion que contiene es muy util, pero se basa en una version anterior de visual basic, aunque es de mucha utilidad para los principiantes"
3,cute shoe,"I bought these in black/multi. I like the shoes they look cute with jeans or with a simple causal black dress. My only complaint is that they rubbed the back of my heal raw. They are comfortable as far as walking and standing, just the elastic part on the back was uncomfortable/painful so if you can think of something to help with the rubbing I highly recommend it. I don't know if I bought them to small I am between a 7-7 1/2 so it is always hard buying shoes online but I just LOVE the variety."
1,"Great quality pics, poor quality printer","If you look at the reviews, you'll notice a Jekyll and Hyde trend in the reviews. Most everyone likes the prints when the printer works. I truly hope Kodak steps up their quality control program. I too am one of those consumers that likes the printer, but darned if I can get it to work. I bet you I have only made a dozen prints and this thing has been a paperweight ever since. Darn those people from Kodak. If you disregard these negative reviews, BUYER BEWARE!"
4,Nice prints,It's prints are beautiful and quick. I love the fact you can use it with our without it hooked to the computer. Very easy to use.Now for the reason it only gets a 4. The Kodak program has a hard time recognizing the camera is in dock. I even used the special plastic thing that is suppose to make it hold my series of camera in there.Other than that I love it!
1,STAY AWAY - Pictures are great - paper feeder works 2% of the time,"Absolutly the worst engineered paper feeder of all time. The frustration far exceeds the nice pictures. ""Easy""share? You've got to be kidding. That is the LAST thing this printer dock is. Stay FAR away from this one. This one worked for 22 pictures, then would no longer pull in paper."
5,"Totally Pleased. First rate photo's at home, smae price or less.","Totally Pleased. First rate photo's at home, same price or less as store processed. I have used the dock extensively! Owned for 18 months now. printed a few hundred pictures not one failure or problem."
4,Easy Share,"This was a replacment, but was an upgrade from what I had. Kodak's easy share printer dock is an excellent value."
2,Flaky paper handling,"I got this printer, together with the Kodak Easyshare C340 camera.When the printer works, the pictures are beautiful.But the printer has a serious paper handling problem.first, every single sheet of paper must be pushed in, it will not pick up the paper on its own.After you push the paper in, it will either jam, because it pulled several sheets or will report that is a paper jam, just because the sensors didn't detect the paper size.Sadly, I also got plenty of paper and ink cartridges for this, that I must keep using it. When they run out, this printer will either go to a new owner or the garbage.Kodak email support is great. Very prompt responses.The support for other operating systems is nonexistent. No support for Windows XP 64 bit edition.I'm now looking at the photo printers offerings from Epson.Hope this helps."
1,Not well made.,"My daughter and I both brought Kodak camera bundles that included this dock. We both love our cameras, easy to use and great pictures. My daughters dock failed withing 6 months of use. My daughter did use her printer much more than I do. New baby, she was snapping and printing pictures regularly. Her dock stopped loading paper, wheels would just spin. Needless to say my dock is now doing the very same, and I used my printer very lightly. I have printed only 60 pictures.(over 18months) How do I know this? You get 10 sheets to start you out. And I brought the refill kit of 200 sheets for future use. I have 150 sheets left! When it worked the pictures were great!"
1,Jams and misfeeds make this totally unacceptable,"As other reviewers have stated, when it works the pictures are of very nice quality. Unfortunately, the misfeeds and jams started after printing a small number of pictures (20 at most) and have gotten worse and worse until it's totally useless. Do NOT buy this piece of junk."
2,Major source of aggravation!!,"This printer is incredibly frustrating to use! I had an earlier version that worked better until it jammed and then broke. This one is terrible - it either doesn't pick up the paper so it thinks it's out of paper, or it jams, or there's some other error. It is a piece of junk. When it does work correctly (and this is after 1 1/2 hours of messing with it), the pictures are beautiful. However, the ink and the paper are not designed well enough to work together despite Kodak's claims -- I always run out of ink before I run out of paper, and you can't purchase just the ink without the paper.Overall, I have to say that few things aggravate me as much as this printer. The reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 2 is because when it works, it works great. But it's such a piece of crap that it rarely works. I wouldn't give this printer to my worst enemy!"
4,A good purchase,"I was very happy to find the printer dock for our Kodak Easyshare camera. The original printer that was purchased with the camera broke. Kodak does not make that printer any more. The printer dock I purchased on amazon is working just fine, I was very lucky to have found it.Thank you.Cora"
5,My Convenience,"This product gives me a convenient chance to edit, modify, and control the type and number of photos I can personally make here at home.It is a shame that Kodak elected to discontinue this product,but, thru the vast informational sources available on Amamzon.com,I was able to find a source at the ""CameraGuy Store"" and the received item was even better that I had expected.I believe that the evaluation of the advertisers on ""Amazon.com"" contributed to this outcome."
2,Kodak Easy Share Printer Dock Series 3,"I've had my printer dock for about 4 years and the only reason I keep it is because it also charges the battery to the camera. My main problem is 9 times out of 10, the printer jams or misfeeds. I just tried the rubbing alcohol on the paper roller and it was able to grab the paper. Also, the picture doesn't print out immediately, it pulls the picture back and forth through the paper feed to add each additional layer of color so this constant use of the paper feed may also be the reason for the paper jams. The picture quality is good but I've just reverted back to uploading my pictures and having them printed at local store. This product is not recommended."
2,Very disappointing,It was very easy to load the printer cartridge and attach my camera to the dock.The pictures I printed had yellow lines.I followed all the suggestions in the guide and called Kodak customer service and the solution was to send it in to be serviced.So I never got to use the product. This was a birthday present so we were doubly disappointed.I recently purchased the G600 printer dock and was very pleased. The pictures are sharp and clear as getting them printed professionally.
2,More Gimmick Than Tool,"We thought it would be cool to have a widget that both downloaded our photos to the computer and printed high-quality prints. Turns out we almost never use the printer... which has been annoyingly glitchy since we first set it up and tried it out.Recommend that owners of Kodaks stay with the plain vanilla dock included with their camera, and acquire one of the inexpensive, widely available multifunction photo-printers for their computer setup. One of those will print your documents as well as your photos, and at the moment they are dirt cheap too."
1,Easy Share . . . NOT,The quality of the pictures are nice WHEN they will actually print. Unless you use the printer with your camera ON the dock it is incredibly hard to get the darn thing to work. If you decide to crop the picture on your PC and then want to print it be prepared to invest time in getting the darn thing to work! I have had it for sometime now and I have never been more irritated than when it comes time to print pictures on this thing.
2,One problem after the next,"I got this printer bundled with the Kodak P880 camera and I love the camera, but the photos on this printer always come out with a dull, grayish look, like the color is washed out. I have had them developed elseware and the colors are beautiful.I had problems with it not recognizing that it has paper in it or saying it wasn't Kodak paper, when it was. I've had problems with it not knowing it was connected to the computer. Today, it decided to stop recognizing it's USB port, so I give up. I wish I hadn't bought all the stupid paper and color cartriges.Now I have to go through the ordeal of convincing my husband that I need yet another printer. *sigh*"
4,Good product,"Photos printed are very sharp. Some difficulty with printer cartidge and as expensive as they are, you can't afford to have much difficulty. Good for craft times with the kids."
5,Kodak makes things so easy,Kodak has made life so easy. This little camera and printer dock are both amazing and easy to use. It only took me a few minutes to get it figured out and it prints awesome pictures.
1,Buy it from Kodak.com for $139 instead of from here,[...]I was interested in buying this photo printer as a Christmas present for my niece as she has a compatible Kodak camera to use with it but I noticed the price that Amazon has it listed for and thought there must be some kind of mistake since it can be purchased for $[...] directly from Kodak
1,EasyShare - Piece of JUNK!,"One of the worst products that I have ever owned. Poorly quality, unreliable.Printer software is bloated and slows down the computer at boot. Synching a camera with the computer is hit or miss. Often takes several iterations of plugging/unplugging the camera/dock. Printer paper won't feed properly - gets jammed every other picture and ends up wasting the color carteridge. All-in-all this is a piece of junk and I would not recommend it to anyone.Prints about 1 picture out of 10 successfully and even then the quality is not that great.Only significant use I've found for this is as an ugly paperweight."
1,BUYER BEWARE KODAK EASYSHARE PRINTER DOCK SERIES 3,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!BUYER BEWARE this printer has been one agonizing problem after another and now IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. It does print nice pictures when it works. Right now my pictures do not load, I went to tech support and they told me I have to send in the printer for repair. I bought this in April of 2007 and it quit working in November of 2007. I maybe printed 100 pictures in that time. Take my advice and save yourself the money, time, and headache. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THE EASYSHARE PRINTER DOCK SERIES 3!!!! I would not even want a free one (I'm not kidding, it is too frustrating)."
3,Kodak easyshare printer dock,"This is the second printer dock I have purchased in a little over a year. The first one gave me problems in that the message to replace paper occured while there was still plenty of paper in the tray. It finally stopped, would not grab the paper any longer. I replaced it with a new one, but my camera would not fit on the dock, and I had to call Kodak and purchase an adaptor for about $15.00 plus shipping. It seems to be working alright, although I have not had a chance to really put it to the test of multiple prints. I am keeping my fingers crossed, because I really like the concept of immediately printing my pictures."
3,Kodak printer dock,Order was received as promised in good condition. After receiving the docking station I tried it out and it worked fine. I ordered some more paper and ink for the printer and found that with the second ink cartridge I was getting some crazy lines on the paper. Not sure if it is because of the printer or the new ink at this point.
1,Kodak Kamera Krap,"This is the worst camera and photo printer I have ever bought. The camera eats batteries (gets about 10-12 pictures from new batteries) and the photo printer is very expensive to print a few photos. It is cheaper (and better photos) to have ""WalSMart"" to print off ones memory card from a camera. I believe I used this printer about possibly 15 photos before setting it to the side. Ink is expensive and not much of it. It is not worth the scrap price. THe camera is an Easyshare C875 and the printer dock is a Easy Share Printer Dock Series 3. Get anything else and you will be happier. This is equivalient to a throw-a-way camera. Mine has been idle for about a year and I think it would be a crime to donate it to a thrift store."
3,Great Printer - Software May Be Trouble for Windows XP Pro Users,"I got the printer as part of camera/dock/printer combo as a gift - have used the printer a while and like it - nice quality. The paper/cartridge packs are a little expensive, but I really only print off those pics I want to give way so it's still loads less expensive that developing/printing rolls of film.HOWEVER -- If you use Windows XP Pro (not an issue for XP Home users) beware that the printer driver will not work *at all* unless you have administrative rights. Kodak Support confirmed that this is ""as intended.""This could be a show-stopping concern for any small businesses or home users that have a computer with XP Pro -- most of them have the users set up without Administrative rights."
4,Good collection of driver profiles,"This is a good collection of 24 driver profiles. The book is very easy and enjoyable to read. It has an assortment of the top drivers as well as a few middle-of-the-pack guys. Each profile ranges from 7-11 pages, so there's decent coverage of the following drivers: John Andretti, Rich Bickle, Brett Bodine, Geoffrey Bodine, Ward Burton, Dale Earnhardt, Bill Elliott, Jeff Gordon, Ron Hornaday, Kenny Irwin, Dale Jarrett, Bobby Labonte, Kevin Lepage, Dave Marcis, Jeremy Mayfield, Mike McLaughlin, Jerry Nadeau, Steve Park, Kyle Petty, Robert Pressley, Elliott Sadler, Mike Skinner, Tony Stewart, and Darrell Waltrip"
5,Psychology: An Introduction,"I teach Psychology courses, and this text is great for the student and instructor! Even students who are not interested in psychology learn a lot from this text. It's written in an easy to read, 'grab your curiosity' way. It's thorough, fascinating to the new and experienced reader of psychology. Great text! It's updated regularly, so for the newest information, you've got the right book...."
1,NOT the current book,"When I looked this item up on amazon, it had a nice blue and yellow picture for the newer edition. This is NOT the current, acceptable edition (for Wright State at least). Do yourself a favor and message the seller and ask them what the cover looks like - because Amazon showed me two very different pictures for the same item! Now my homework is due and I'm reading the wrong text!"
4,Good Service,"The service was good. The book came in a timely fashion from a third party person. However, I just wished that I could have had the book shipped express."
4,Great! If they fit...,"Good thing my wife has two sets of piercings on her ears, these would only fit on the outer ones. They are very small. Seriously... look at the picture. Look at the rod that goes through the ear. It's a normal sized (small) gauge. These are tiny earings. I'm serious."
4,Fun book to listen to.,I really enjoyed listening to Microthrills. Wendy Spero has an amusing perspective on life and she's really good at conveying it in her stories. Her impressions of her mom are priceless.
5,"You'll laugh until you hurt, flip the page, and repeat","Wow. What a total and utter surprise.After reading the rave reviews on Amazon I figured I would get the book and it would be a letdown. Good, but not 5-star good. Well, I was wrong -- and the reviews were right. Do yourself a favor and get this book.You probably won't learn any life lessons that you can teach your children, but you'll close the book with an understanding of life in another person's shoes. There were lots of things I was shocked about (people live like that?!) and just as many things I identified with (oh my gosh, me too!!). As soon as I finished this book I forced my roomate to read it -- every 5 minutes there was a roar of laughter from the next room for the next few nights.Its honest. Its funny. You'll want to read it all, and you'll be sad when it is over. I recommend it."
3,it so hard too say goodbye,i really really enjoy fullmetal alchemist series. I can't wait for the new brotherhood series.
5,Best Anime of Our Time,"FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST! It's such a great anime. ANY anime fan NEEDS to add Fullmetal Alchemist to their collection.My review on Fullmetal Alchemist volume 13 Brotherhood: It didn't even take me a year to get this DVD and finish up my Fullmetal Alchemist collection. This anime is very addictive. And once you get down to Volume 13, it'll have you almost falling out of your seat! Everytime I watch this DVD I end up crying. HECK! In almost any Fullmetal Alchemist DVD I cry. But these epsiodes are chalk full of heartbreak. I think this anime ended well. And this DVD deffinitly deserves 5 stars. It deserves it all the way."
2,"Waugh! *NOT* ""complete""! Disappointing. Still, dS it is.","Terrible. Awful. Horrible. LIARS! Everything in the first season EXCEPT *THE* single most important episode!! The Pilot?! What a bunch of @#$%^&*! Besides that, it's okay. The rest of the eps are there, & it *is* due South. Some special features would have been nice, but are hardly requisite.The episodes rate a 5, but lousing up but not including the premiere & especially after billing it as the complete 1st season rates a two. Let's hope they did better with season 2 & will do better with season 3!"
4,Canadian DVDs are superior to the U.S.,The VHS tape masters were used for the Platinum DVDs. The budget minded buyer can go for the cheaply mastered U.S. DVDs. But those wanting quality will go for the much higher priced Canadian DVDs from Alliance. Those were mastered for DVD by the production masters. You can save alot of money by ordering them directly from Amazon's Canadian Division (click on the Canadian button at the bottom of this page).
5,Incredible value,"This is an amazing deal - there are no extras, just a very basic menu with chapter selections, and very occasionally the picture quality is not so great, but to get the whole 24 episodes for this price is fantastic!Nicely packaged in a card box, on 4 discs. Fullscreen.Disc One:- Pilot Parts 1 & 2- Free Willie- Diffenbaker's Day Off- Manhunt- They Eat Horses, Don't They?Disc Two:- Pizzas and Promises- Chinatown- Chicago Holiday, part 1- Chicago Holiday, part 2- A Cop, a Mountie, and a Baby- Gift of the WheelmanDisc Three:- You must remember this- Hawk and Handsaw- An Eye for an Eye- The Man Who Knew Too Little- The Wild Bunch- THe Blue LineDisc Four:- The Deal- An Invitation to Romance- Heaven and Earth- Victoria's Secret - Part 1- Victoria's Secret - Part 2- Letting Go"
4,Save a bundle! Buy this set.,"""Due South"" comes in two releases for the first season. There is a high priced release missing the two-part series premier and then there is this cheaper release.What is the difference? This release was mastered from the original broadcast tapes. As such it isn't perfect, but it does contain the pilot episodes. I feel that saving the money in order to get those pilot episodes gives those viewers a chance to see an important background into the main characters.This set does not contain, and you aren't paying for, closed captioning, languages other than English, or an extensive menu structure. I can live with that to save a lot of money."
2,Awful dvd cases,"I love Due South, but presentation of these dvds is quite simply below par. The dvds are doublesides, which makes them extra vulnerable to damage, which is all too frequent considering the dvd case they come in. The three dvds overlap each in a case, which refuses to let go of the dvds in question. Detaching the dvds from the case can only be achieved by causing cracks on the dvd. If you buy this season, as Due South fans inevitably will, do not keep the dvds in these case. Use separate jewel cases for them."
4,Re-ignighting the Mountie obsession,"I was so pleased to see that the Mountie has finally been released on DVD. Sadly, as noted by other reviewers this DVD lacks extra goodies and the pilot. The case is terrible but mostly because you have to fight to remove the disks from it. Fortunately, these small defects are more than made up for by the fantastic first season of Due South which includes some of the show's best episodes. (Victoria's Secret,The Gift of the Wheelman, and The Deal to name a few) Now we all have to wait and see if Alliance-Atlantis is only teasing the rabid Due South fans out there or if they intend to release the other seasons as well.(HINT- people would buy them) A note to Amazon.ca: this show had many American fans as well.. perhaps you could advertise this DVD on your other site better."
5,Fantastic!,An absolutely unique and delightful show! BUT...stop at the end of Season Two. Season Three is almost wholly abominable.
3,Good for the money,"For what you pay, you really get great value, here. No, there's no widescreen, no CC and no scene selection and the quality isn't what you'd get out of the Canadian version, but at least with this release we finally have the pilot that should've been inculded in the original release. And it's still very watchable, VHS-type quality aside.I could wish for a whole lot more in the way of features and quality, but it would probably end up costing much more and this was about all I could afford. It's worth they money, here, just don't expect too much out of it."
2,deaf customers beware,"I like the series, however it does not have subtitles. A severely hearing impairedindividual, I was very disappointed. It says that it has subtitles, but does not. I wil give the DVD to a friend."
4,"Fine, funny show, poor DVD quality","I was vaguely aware of this light-hearted suspense/mystery show when it was on in the mid-90s, but never watched it. The reason my wife and I picked up on it recently was because of star Paul Gross's more recent comedy, Slings and Arrrows (a work of genius, BTW, in the league of Ricky Gervais's The Office). Due South is funny, action-packed, full of delightful characters (including a deaf wolf named after a former Canadian PM), and not a little bittersweet. As suspense-mysteries go, the shows aren't bad either. One caveat, though: By jamming 6 hour-format episodes on each disk, the manufacturer has degraded the visual quality. During any action sequence there's terrible pixilation and breakup. So long as the actors aren't moving very much, it looks OK. We're willing to put up with the visual issues because we've become quite fond of the show."
2,"*NOT* complete! No pilot! Buy, but be warned.","Terrible. Awful. Horrible. LIARS! Everything in the first season EXCEPT *THE* single most important episode!! The Pilot?! What a bunch of @#$%^&*! Besides that, it's okay. The rest of the eps are there, & it *is* due South. Some special features would have been nice, but are hardly requisite.The episides rate a 5, but lousing up but not including the premiere & especially after billing it as the complete 1st season rates a two. Let's hope they did better with season 2 & will do better with season 3!"
4,A Great Series That Deserves A Better DVD In America,"The first season in a couple of words is simply fantastic. The story of a Mountie and his wolf teaming up with a Chicago detective makes a really interesting story that works. Paul Gross is definitely the right choice to play the lead in this series and Benton Fraser. Some stories are funny and others are touchingly emotional. Even now, this series hasn't aged one bit and it is a shame that it is never talked about much here in the US. Great episodes are in this season, but the DVD is lacking when it comes to content and picture. No special features are to be found on this DVD and the picture quality isn't the best, with streaks appearing for a couple of seconds in about three episodes, but most of the time it is great. But with those small flaws, the episodes are so great, all of the mistakes with the American DVD can be forgiven. This is definitely a great series that is recommend for all."
3,A wonderful series but......,"Due South ranks highly on my ""Favorite TV-Shows of All-Time"" list. As someone who doesn't like TV in general, except for sports, I couldn't help falling in love with this show when it was on the air. It is wonderful to know I will always be able to check out this sleeper series whenever I want. That being said, the DVDs themselves are actually somewhat disappointing. The case the discs come in is awful. I never saw a case that required you to slip the insert over top of one of the discs. The other two discs are staggered over each other on the opposite side and are somewhat difficult to remove. The discs are pretty bare bones with only still backgrounds and no motion menus. For those of you who are really picky, you'll notice the picture jump from time to time as a result of a poor telecining process. Alliance, please take note when/if you deliver Season 2 & 3. As unfortunate as this is, you'll soon forget once immersed in the series' wonderful story lines."
3,Due South Season 1,Will NOT (would not) purchase without the Pilot episode! What were they thinking? Apparently they weren't.
3,Yes it is...,"It is a nickel finish threaded steel rod made for the fan I ordered from them and it is 36"" long.What more can I say about it?"
2,Marsona 1288 Programmable Sound Conditioner,"I was disappointed with quality of sound and variety of settings for the price paid. Granted you can ""tweek"" using the tone and volume settings however it just never measured up to the quality I expected paying over $100 for the unit. It always seemed to have a raspy, sometimes bordering on obnoxious, tone no matter what setting I used. I also expected it to have more in the way of programmable settings versus just putting a critter sound in the background. Alas. Marsona 1288A Programmable Sound Conditioner"
1,Awful,"I think my 1974 clock radio had a better speaker in it. This thing sounds horrible. No bass whatsoever. The speaker sounds ""blown"". The ""tone"" control ranges from tinny to sounding entirely muffled. So the only option tolerable is the ""White Noise"" selection, as the lack of proper sound doesn't detract from it. However, try to put the volume above 1/3 and the unit actually vibrates, which makes its own distracting noise! I'm amazed this item received any decent reviews."
2,New model cannot match the old one.,"I have owned a Marsona Sound Machine(1250) for over 20 years. I recently took it on a trip,and discovered that it had stopped working at some point in transit. Devastated. I cannotlive/sleep without it. I ordered a new one, a Marsona 1288A, and discovered that it was notperfect like my old one. I can hear the 'looping', and my ears cannot filter out that sound.Not effective for those of us with sensitive hearing. Out of necessity, I have since hadmy old one serviced locally, now hopefully it will live on another 20+ years! The old model wasperfect for me. Returning the new one, sad to say...."
2,So-so,"Am unsure whether I'll return this or not.This device has ~8 background sounds (2 rain, 2 waves, etc). I don't notice the problem with looping mentioned by others. There are ~8 overlay sounds which can be combined with the background noise- mainly various birds. Several of the bird sounds are a little unpleasant; when I first heard the owl I thought one of my kids was hurt.My main gripe with this product is that when you keep it close by, there is a clear static background hiss at most volumes which becomes very annoying. I think if you were to keep it tucked further away into a corner that would not be an issue.Thinking about it now, this device really doesn't do anything that a couple of $15 nature CDs can't do, & the CDs would likely have better sound quality."
2,Sound Quality and Overlay,"This unit is not worth the money.........The overlays that you can select are horrible and would keep one awake ! Even with the straight sound, there are mild intrusive overlays that creep in (they come and go in a consistant manner so must be built into the program) I think I'll try Hammacher Schlemmer next since this Marpac doesn't cut it!"
2,"Ordered a Champ, received a Parts Plus","I ordered a Champ Oil Filter but that's not what I received. I instead got a Parts Plus Oil Filter. I understand the fact that there aren't too many makers of oil filters and Champ probably makes them for Parts Plus, but I didn't order a generic filter and didn't pay a generic price. If I wanted a generic filter then that's what I would order. I kept it and will use it because it looks like a good filter, I just didn't appreciate the substitution."
4,A good start,"Much better than I had hoped. Yes, there is much shown about the Allies and the SS in this DVD, but some of the segments, such as the jump school drop in France, is some of the best stuff I have seen. If you are a reenactor for the FJ, this is a must video. Be warned, it has the typical British slant (they won the war, America was just there for fun) but it is a good starting video and something you will want to watch more than once."
4,good footage and analysis,"Most of the footage on this DVD comes from German WW2 newsreels and hence is quite biased with respect to showing paratrooper losses and defeats. Nevertheless, if you can overcome this weakness, it is quite good. German paratroopers are shown, primarily, in their ground role in the Italian fronts (with emphasis on Monte Casino and Sicily) and Western Front (with emphasis on Normandy). Unfortunately, there is just about no footage of these troops in other fronts (i.e., Eastern front). The DVD, as well as providing fairly good footage, also provides fairly good analysis, at least for the novice (anyone knowledgeable on the subject would know nearly everything discussed on the DVD), albeit in comes in the form of very monotone English accent. The level of analysis is definitely far better than what would find on documentaries presented on the topic on the History, Discovery or Military Channels. All and all a very good DVD."
1,Poor quality,"I thought these earrings looked really cute in the picture, but I was very disappointed when I received them. I thought they were of poor quality, and the stars bent out of shape when I opened and closed them. In addition, the latch on one side was very loose, and the other side was very stiff (hence the bending of the shape). Needless to say, I returned them."
1,Big disappointment :(,"Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this item. Dont get me wrong, the earrings are beautiful, but after waiting a month after ordering these earrings (after my order kept getting pushed back and pushed back), I got a defective earring that would'nt even close. Now I have to return it and hope I dont have to wait another month to get the replacement. More hassle than they were worth, for the quality is below what I expected :("
1,Very unsatisfied with product,This product did not help in the sink like I thought it would have.It stained my sink and I had to throw away.
3,just another dvd,"save your money and your time. there's some good fights. beat downs and submisissions. the girls go hard, but seriously, who cares?"
3,Not great for identification.,"This book has beautiful pictures and is a nice introduction into marble collecting. However, it is not very helpful in identifying your marbles. There are pictures of different manufacture's marbles but enough information to teach you how to tell them apart yourself."
3,Marble Identification,"I was disappointed not only in the size of this price and identification guide for marbles, but also in the marbles that were covered. I was looking for a guide that would help me identify older, but more common marbles, not so many pages on sulphides with characters encased and rare marbles."
4,good kit,"I bought this kit for my son who just got a clarinet. I know nothing about wind instruments so buying a ""kit"" worked for me. Got the stuff quickly and my son uses it.. so it must be good"
5,This CD was awesone!!!,"I loved this CD. My favorite songs were ""MMMBop"", ""Weird"", ""Where's the Love"", and ""I Will Come to You"". This was the best CD that I've bought in a long time."
5,Middle Of Nowhere Rules,"Middle of Nowhere was the boys third cd.It took them 13 major lables to finaly get signed.The Dust Brothers help them out with traks Thinking of You and that infatuious beat of MMMBop.The added the loops and scratchy beats to the songs.While during that recording process the middle brother Taylor experienced his voice changed.4 notes lower!Its a good tape with R&B and rock put together in an alternative form.Its great,if you don't like it the kids will!"
4,My review on MON,"This album is one of the best pop albums around. And boy, these boys sure have talent."
4,"Wierd, No Good","Hanson were fresh faced when this album full of top class songs that captivated the whole world over. I was one of many who bought this album and i was 17. This album is full of top rated songs like MMMbop (UK number 1), Thinking Of You, Where The Love, and I Will Come To You. Hanson are unique in the sense that they write their own songs and play their own instruments. Well done lads!!!"
5,In my CD player 24/7 !,"I bought the CD with much hessitation but as soon as it was playing I loved it. The music expresses feelings and emotions variying from the depressing in YEARBOOK, pure up-beat happiness in MMMBOP and sadness in WITH YOU IN YOUR DREAMS. Go get it because of all the new (and great) music you'll hear!"
5,Hanson is the best band in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I like this cd a lot. I have 5 cd's of Hanson! I like ""MMMBop"" and ""Wheres the love"" there my favorit"
3,Has to make you smile!,"I can't say that I'm fortunate enough to own any of Hanson's albums, but that's okay because some of my friends own it and I can listen to it whenever I want. It's funny because we also bring it into class and listen to ""mmmbop"" and talk about how ""pretty"" the guys are, even though I'm a guy myself, I think that because of their long hair and their faces, you could call the older two ""pretty."" I do have to recommend this album because the songs are happy songs, and I can't listen to any of them without giggling and smiling. I hope this review was helpful to you."
1,I really did not like this!,"My sister has the CD, I don't, but she got it right after it came out and played it all the time, so I have heard it more than I've wanted to! We both agree, (she does too now) that it is extremely Whiney and pretty lame."
2,Music is bad,"This band does suck, but Hanson can write their own songs and play their own instruments (That the reason why I gave them 2 stars); but their music is bad"
1,What a mistake!!,"One of my schoolmates said that Hanson were like Sepultura and Fear Factory so I got the album, and it is FAECES!!! Most boys Hanson's age would like metal but these are girls as I found out...."
1,Get your ears checked!!!!!,"If you like hanson you have a problem, I mean a very serious problem! Can't you see they are girls! They even sound like girls. They really deserve no stars. If I could have, I would have given them negative 50 stars! They suck! All of their music sounds the same! And are Ike and Taylor real names!! Why don't you listen to something good like N'SYNC or Savage Garden!!!"
1,12-year olds and Cereal,It's nice to know 12-year olds can finally come home to a CD worthy of coming out of a Cap'n Crunch box. Is it any wonder they're getting an endorsement from Eggo waffles?
1,Who would recommend this?,"Trust me,I was definately the most obsessed Hanson fan existing at one time,but that was when I was a 12 year old little girl confused about love, reality,and my own honest beliefs.In this time of confusion,I also thought Hanson to be meaningful, passionate ""men"" that knew their music. Aka I bought this album.It strikes me odd that there are people out there who still listen to the type of music on Middle Of Nowhere and find it chock-full of soul and poetry.But think about it.How great can this bubble gum pop album be?(Besides the fact they were accompanied by experienced adults) 3 boys.All minors,Christian(gag me),home-schooled (gag me),no experience whatsoever in the love/relationship world,and brothers.It's too innocent.No perspective.All the ""soul"" you hear from Tay is an empty,meaningless voice strain.They haven't grown up.Haven't evolved.I don't trust their music ever will.DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!"
1,Not my fave CD (can't you tell by the rating!),"I really don't have a fealing for hanson, but I think they are a very talented group of brothers. This music is not really for the mature person, but for kids this CD will rock their world.-sorry you hanson lovers out there!(at least I didn't say something worse!)(not that I would, and not that think anything worse about them)"
4,my review,2 good sides1. great CD to listen all the way through 2. great bass on Madeline2 bad sides1. not enough music 2. your friends will most likely tease 4 having it
5,Very good!,"I got this cd back in 1997 and I still listen to it. its an awesome cd... you might only remember them for 'mmmbop' but theres other great songs on it, too.please give it a chance, i guarantee you will enjoy it! if you really want to see how their music has evolutionized, buy 'this time around' and 'underneath'. if you're not a fan, you probably will be."
4,Bah.,"I don't know what these people are talking about! I'm 17 and I still love this album. This girl talks about how she liked them when she was 9?? You don't know music when you're 9. Hanson are not a boyband at all. I still think they have a lot of talent, even though I have moved on to bands such as Megadeth, Slipknot, Yngwie Malmsteen, and other metal. Of course I still hold a special place in my heart for these brothers, and STILL say this is a good CD. Teenyboppers like this greenday Lauren girl should not talk. Anyone who likes crappy pop-punk such as Blink 182 and Sum 41 can NOT talk about anything having to do with music. I mean can you honestly trust someone's review of an album who gave 5 stars to the new Good Charlotte album??? Yeah, that's what I thought."
3,Okay,"Look, it's not as bad as some of you are making it out to be. They DO have talent and a great harmony. And it's DEFINITELY not just bubblegum pop. Go listen to ""Weird"" and tell me that's bubblegum. Still, I think the first few songs are good and then the last few start getting tedious. And the lead singer's voice does get a bit annoying after a while.But all in all, they receive more criticism than they are due. Just because they were a one hit wonder does not make them uttterly talentless. I liked the CD because it made me laugh and dance around like an idiot from the 1st song on. You judge for yourself, but just let go of your idiodic stereotypes for a moment and listen to it for the music."
5,The ... Brothers Hanson,"Hanson are a musical trio of brothers like the Brothers Gibb or the Bee Gees. This album was released on May 6,1997 just like the Bee Gees' STILL WATERS album. Ths album was an almost immediate hit but the first single,""MMMBop"" was an immediate hit. The next single was ""Where's The Love"",which I really loved. That was when I started to like these guys. I think the next single,following ""MMMbop"" was ""I Will Come To You"". I detect a strong resemblance between Isaac Hanson's(the oldest of the three) and Jon Bon Jovi's voice. ""I Will Come To You"" sounds kind of like a Bon Jovi recording. The high pitched voice we hear on this recording is eleven-year-old Zachary's(the youngest of the three). This album would sell constantly from its release date to the end of 1998. Hanson promoted this album still in July 1998,recording LIVE FROM ALBERTANE...."
5,The Best CD Ever!,"This is the Best Album you can buy,ever!It's fabulous music by 3 talented brothers!Go for it!"
1,there songs are stupid and pointless.,"they're songs have no meaning and often end up in ""the middle of nowhere""(like MMMBop) save your money and go buy something else."
1,I DON'T THINK SO!!,"YUCK! Hanson is yet another one of those teenage groups that sing bubblegum pop. These three boys(or are they girls?!) have absolutely NO musical talent. And that whole ""wow they play their own instruments"" thing has totally gone out of hand, 'cause their ""music"" sounds horrible. Not only that, but they look like they are barely twelve years old.(especially the drummer who really must be six years old) Oh yeah, and their songs sound horrible too, and make no sense. What is mmmbop supposed to mean, anyway? If you want real music, do not pick Hanson as your choice. They're so called ""record"" is just a big waste of money!"
1,And they call Marilyn Manson evil,"Be prepared to waste nearly an hour of your life. Hanson's MIDDLE OF NOWHERE is where this CD ought to be. Pure pop pablum, regurgitated without a hint of creativity, this CD might best have been marketed for pre-teens. Along with the Backstreet Boys and Spice Girl media blitzes of the mid-90s, MIDDLE OF NOWHERE marks a low water mark for Western Civilization."
1,Are people actually allowed to make CD's this horrible?,Hey if you are ever looking for a horrible CD to give to somebody as a prank this is it.Hanson is just another fad like NSYNC or the New Kids On The Block. Pretty soon They'll be mmmboppin they're way to the bottom. The one plus about Hanson is they have that really pretty girl that in age is between the two sissy boys. So do not buy this CD!
1,I personally hate Hanson.,"Hanson, they all look like girls and I hate the Lead Singers Voice. He looks like a girl by the way. They had one hit on their song and it was good for onlya few weeks. Then it got annoying, it already was anyways."
1,Join me in getting that one star average!,Help fellow hanson haters everyone who dislikes hanson prove it by reviewing this cd say somethiing short that shows you hate them. Join me hanson haters we can make a difference!WE HATE HANSON!
1,What!? No zero rating!!,Terrible CD. Don't waste your money$ people! Hanson is just 3 dorks with long hair and sing/look like girls. I only have their CD because it was a present. Anyone want it! I will give it to you for FREE!
1,"Bubblegum teenybopper crap, 'nuff said.","These guys are awful, just like all that other bubblegum *** out there like N'sync and 98 degrees. When will they learn that no one likes them anymore. These ""guys"" have zero talent, and only sell because girls think they are cute. ""MMMBop"" is one of the stupidest songs on the market. On, ""I Will Come To You,"" the middle one (also the gayest one) sounds like someone is giving it to him up the tailpipe. Just like all bubblegum crap, these guys went byebye a long time ago. Also, these guys are not very good singers. If you want to hear really good vocals, check out the likes of Queen and Led Zeppelin, stuff that actually made a difference in music."
3,"A pretty good disc, some good songs, rockin tunes","I can't say that I like Hanson, but I hate to admit, but I liked some songs on it. Sure, MMMBop gets stuck in fans' heads, but one of the only ones i liked was Man From Milwaukee. I don't think I will buy it, but an occasional listen to some of the tunes is fine for me."
3,A fairly nice effort,"Everyone either loves Hanson or hates them - except me. Some of their songs are naggingly catchy (""MMMBop"" gets stuck in my head, whether I like it or not), but much of this album has a sort of sameness. The phrase ""one-hit wonder"" is hard to escape, and I think that, like The New Kids On the Block, they'll be hip for a while and then disappear, because what's going to happen when they grow up? Without much room to grow musically, this should be forgotten by the year 2000."
5,Cool!,I really like this CD for 3 reasons: because they play their own instruments and write their own songs; they sing really well; and they are a good influence for kids who want to get into the music business. But the real reason I love this CD is because I just love the band!
2,wackity wackity wack wack wack,"this album is absolutely horrible. i don't care how young these kids were when they wrote it. read the lyrics, they are HORRIBLE. these little kids are only getting props because of what they are-little, young, kids. so people automatically think they're awesome because they're 14 years old. take it from me, this album is the worst CD out there. it's worth 1 star, but i gave it 2 because at least they write their own lyrics and play their own instruments."
5,lovin it to the end,this cd tells in music not just talent but also passion they tell us to hold on to the ones we luv cuz inthe end there the onlys ones we have this is true i didnt even know who they were until me best friend showed me a picture of them and let me listento their cd and i feel in love w/ it that i now have almost ever cd osf them. i love them and people should not critice them because of the way they look or the one song that evry1 hears they shoul take the time to actually listen to them insted of just judgin all thr time
5,Hanson ROCKS!,I really think that Hanson did a GREAT job on Middle Of Nowhere! I hope Hanson puts out more cd's. I hope that Hanson KEEPS dong their SUPER work!
2,"poor, over-rated, unoriginal teen crap","...As for the talent of the hanson brothers, I really don't understand why everyone regards them as musically gifted. Anybody can play power chords and the drum parts just aren't that technical. At the risk of self-proclaiming my band, we could outplay them anyway.I do however, give my regards to the singing only because they have some talent there. But, the brothers poor choice in hair style negates all positive effect given.They get two stars for trying."
4,fun pop rock.,These guys were young and took the music biz by storm back in late 90's. Unfortunately they signed to a rap label and their career was destroyed in the 00's. But Hanson had talent and made great pop rocker songs and best of all they were a band. They played their own instruments and made catchy pop music that both kids and adults could enjoy. they were not like the boy groups of dancing dudes that were made by a record company. These guys were a real band and they deserved the success they had in their day. This type of music is just bouncy fun tunes and it proved that you didn't have to be a nasty mean rapper to sell records. They could have made the transition to a complete adult audience as their mainly teen fanbase grew up but they never got that chance. This is just fun pop rock and that's good enough for me. And it had hit singles to boot.
1,This CD is one of the worst.,"In buying this CD I thought it would be a wise investment. But it really was a bad choice. This group can not sing, it is a sad try to make it big."
1,Some people may like this album,"I think that Hanson is the New Kids On The Block of the late nineties. They may actually sell some albums for a couple years,but soon they'll grow up and they'll end up like Vanilla Ice (remember him?) mmmbop should be mmmflop!!!"
1,MMM..Stop,"What can I say about this cd that you haven't already heard. Hansons major record label debut reminds me of the golden age of bands like Alvin and The Chipmunks or the ever popular Barbie and the Rockers. After thinking about it, I guess the immaturity that Hanson's music reflects can be expected from the teens and pre-teens that the band consists of. This cd is perfect proof that a record company should wait until someones is at least out of high school before they give them a contract."
1,MMM Bop - MMM No Way,"For the exception of Taylor, no of this band can actually sing. The singles are all head wreckers especially - MMM Bop, Where's The Love & Weird. I will come to you is an okay song, but the rest are pretty much the same, ie. Crap. The only reason why people should have this album is if they won it. Don't waste your money"
1,WHAT TALENT?,"After being surprised on how successful Hanson actually became to be after their first single ""MMmbop"" I visited a ""Blockbuster"" music and listened to their whole cd. I'm sorry but their music is completely unoriginal and dreadfully uninspired. They do happen to have decent lyrics though i think they had a lot of help from the army of studio musicians that helped them out with this album. They do possess some talent, however, that can be said of hundreds of thousands of other kids in the United States and around the world."
2,OK,"I THINK THIS CD IS NOT VERY GOOD. IT HAS SOME GOOD SONGS,BUT IT HAS ALL THE SAME KIND OF SONGS,WHAT I MEAN IS THAT THEY MOSTLY ARE JUST BORING."
2,"If you're a screaming twelve-year-old, this is for you.","Hanson's ""Middle of Nowhere:"" what can I say? It was okay, but I'm not really that impressed with it. Sure they write SOME of their songs, but it's going to take a little more than that and a happy beat to win me over. I personally think that they should stop performing right now. No one important considers them to be serious artists anyway. Maybe they should come back in 15 years and try again. Right now they are just three more boys for you screaming twelve-year-olds to obsess over. As for the album, once again, it was okay."
1,can you not give them any stars?,"when i first heard mmmbop, i thought they were girls. i enjoyed the song until i learned that guys could actually sing that high! come on mariah! you have some competition now! when i was little, they could have mixed well with raffi, but trying to market this stuff to teens? they should get a contract with alvin and the chipmunks! they could do some serious business. and as for looks? there's nothing there! i don't get why all the chicas flip when they see hanson. get a clue. look at matt damon! look at ben affleck. look at BSB even! just get over them!mmmbop definition- a brief moment of timehanson- gone in a couple mmmbop's"
1,Too bad you can't choose 0 stars.,"Hanson has no talent. Their catchy tunes stick to you like a bad habit. They are just songs you don't care for. What does he say? Mmmbop, I need a tampon? They are totally unoriginal and almost any teenager could come up with better tunes. Why Hanson became so popular is a mystery. I truly hope they cease to put out albums and just stick to picking up 9-year old girls. Whenever any girl over the age of 15 is asked what they think about Hanson, they always say that they are cute in a little boy sort of way, which makes me laugh every time. Who ever buys this CD deserves to be put in front of a firing squad. Don't get me wrong. I've tried to accept Middle of Nowhere because I listen to everything from Frank Sinatra to Nine Inch Nails to Miles Davis to Busta Rhymes and Middle of Nowhere should really to be thrown...to the middle of nowhere."
1,Could be good--if they actually could SING!!,"Granted, the three brothers (or is it sisters) of Hanson may write their own lyrics (as trite and terrible as they may be) and attempt to play their own instrutments (very poorly--that's why it's considered to be a mere attempt), but the boys (or girls) have the absolute whiniest voices in the music business. Every time one of the girls opens their mouth, a high pitched whine comes out, and it sounds as if someone was scraping their nails across the blackboard. This album was dubbed as the mark for the ""bubble-gum"" pop music come back, yet if all the ""bubble-gum"" pop music sounds as terrible as this, the ""bubble-gum"" music will be a very short, passing fad."
5,"I luv u, man!!!","Well, this is the greatest CD in the world and the universe! I luv all the songs. They are great indeed, if u guys don't have this. Just buy it as soon as possible. I bet it must be the best memory in ur life! Hanson must be the blessing from above."
5,i love it,"i liked every song and when you don't have the cd yet buy it at once because it is a very good cd. especialy the song ""yearbook"""
4,closet Hanson fan comes out!,"As a late twentysomething indie-punk rock fan, and lover of such dark brooders as Black Sabbath and angst-ridden screamers like Hole, why the heck is Hanson spinning in my CD player more than the rest? For starters, its infectious beats and bouncy melodies are like a can full o' insta-happiness. They manage to be cheerful without being precious or cloying or just plain boring like a lot of teen fluff groups that Hanson is unfairly compared with. The Dust Brothers' fantastic production is largely responsible, I'm sure, but it wouldn't work without some spot-on lyrics and Taylor's achingly soulful voice. This is no Nine Inch Nails, but darn it, high school can be pretty traumatic while you're living it, and Hanson manages to capture the sweet frustration of those years with pure sincerity. This is one teenpop band I pray will survive the hype and keep on well into the uncertainties of adulthood. Good job, boys."
2,Exploited Before Their Time,"Okay, I know a billion people have completely blown off Hanson for a multitude of reasons. Unlike most of my friends (i'm 16 and a fanatical music collector), I chose to buy their cd to see for myself why so many people either loved them or hated them with such a passion. After listening to the entire cd, I've come to a distinct conclusion: the Hanson brothers simply haven't had enough time to develop as musicians or as a team, and were exploited at least four or five years before they've reached their potential. I will readily admit that all three of them possess substantial talent, especially the middle one and his singing voice, but they need time to round out. In addition, the moods and lyrics of nearly all of the songs were way too happy and omnipotent (AKA MmmBop) to successfully pervey a teen-ish real world mood. Overall, keep practicing, boys."
5,"girly for sure, but they have talent","Hanson is the type of band that gets made fun of for their look abd style. Sure, I can understand why, but listen to their music for a second. It isn't half bad. The first time i saw them (the same as every 9 year old boy) I thought were kinda cute girls. Leaving that aside, they made good music. They wrote it all as well. The lyrics, of course, are nothing special, but when this album came out, they were kids. After you get past the whole look of them and start listening to some of the music, you'll see what I mean"
2,Not horrible...,"People like to bash Hanson just because they were young and groomed and had a record deal. While they probably WERE signed to be a gimmick, they did have reasonable talent. While their songs aren't driven by the instruments, they still play and they deserve some credit for that, even if their songs are still 1/2 synthesizers. They also write all their songs, so those 2 facts alone should warrant them some respect. Now the music sounds like a 90's version of the Jackson 5, which could either be good or bad depending on your taste. I never would put these guys in the same category as BSB or Nsync as far as 90's boybands go. This is just power pop, but its not THAT bad."
3,i'm over it...,I got this cd when it first came out two and a half years ago when i was 12 and then i would have said 5ive stars...but now that i'm 15 and into different stuff it's very hard to live down the fact that i ever liked them...i'm sorry to all their fans but i used to be one...all their little fans arn't so little anymore! we've grown up! i hope they grow up a little a lot in their next album....
2,not that good sorry,"well i actually used to listen to this non-stop but that was when it first came out, now it's like im a little older and i really cant stand to listen to a bunch of kids singing 'nice' songs what happened to ROCK? i think hanson should make a cool rock record maybe then they will get noticed and appreciated by people. but for the most part i think they need to grow up because most of their fans already have, if you know what i mean! sorry to disappoint all you major fans out there."
1,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"Don't get me wrong. I'm sure Hanson are very nice kids but their music isn't that great. It's like that other sappy bubble-gum music. Such songs as Where's the Love and MMBop can give you a headache. However if you like bubble-gum you should get it. If not, don't."
5,I THINK THIS CD IS THE BEST.,HANSON IS MADE UP OF THREE MUSICAL AND TALENTED BOYS AND THEY WILL GO FAR....
5,Hanson rocks,"This album is awesome!!!!! It actually has real instruments and the brothers play the instruments themselves!! I think Hanson deserves a lot of credit and it's not fair for people to put them down all the time. What they have done and will do in the future takes a lot of talent! They are gonna be around for a long time, so to everyone that is Anti Hanson : GET USED TO IT"
4,A blast from the past.,"I was in junior high when MMMbop came out and like everyone else I thought these three brothers were girls. That damn catchy tune was stuck in my brain for a good six months in 1997. Even though I haven't kept up with their music since, Hanson's debut album Middle of Nowhere was a fun and decent pop album for its time. Songs like Where's The Love?, I Will Come To You, Lucy, With You In Your Dreams, Weird, and Madeline are standouts. Taylor Hanson's vocals are good and even Zac sings on the puppy love track, Lucy. Ah those were the days when kiddie pop ruled the world!"
5,"WOW, That all you can say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",I'm sure that I have never heard these types of beautiful songs from such young people who write their own music. Their music is truly genius. Their slow love songs are incredibly beautiful. Weird is such a beautiful song And I will come to you and with you in your dreams are songs that I could sit down and listen to all day and their cute little pop songs are the bomb. And they are all so cute. You gotta buy this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,They have talent!,"I bought this CD a long time ago and I played it a lot! Of course one of my favorite song was MMMBop. But after exploring the entire CD, I came to appreciate their other songs! They are really talented young men!"
1,This CD is Pathetic,This CD is Completly pathetic. I have heard some of the songs by Hanson and they are just a waste of my time. This noise pollution they call mmmbop is pointless. They only say about 6 different words in the whole song (being : mmbop do be du wop ooo). if you ask me this all a waste of money!
1,i wish i could give this cd 0 stars!,"hi,i'm a girl that hates hanson.my school has about 1,000 people, maybe, maybe 2 people like hanson in my school. i bought it when they were popular. (a long time ago) and after a month i realized, this band SUCKS! they sound like girls and look like girls. after that i sold it for a 25cents. (and that was a rip off) they suck. plain and simple. there only half okay song was mmmbob, or whatever it was. the rest sucked, even though the mmmm thing sucked too! IF YOU WANT TO WAST YOUR MONEY, BUY THIS CD TODAY!"
1,aw man!,"I am a big Hanson fan but I was way dissapointed by this CD! They sounded a-w-f-u-l The bad singing was drowned by a crummy lead guitar and drumming. Sorry Hanson, but putting out this album was a waste of time. BLNT (better luck next time) -a fan"
1,First is the worst,"These girls shouldn't have made this CD,do they think they're Avril Lavigne or something? Well they sound like Britney Spears..What? They're BOYS?!?!"
4,"can we say ""awsome""?!?","This CD has to be one of the greats out there. I don't like all the songs though. Thats why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. ""Lucy"" doesn't apeal to me. But the rest are great! ""Hanson is more than a band...it feels more like a significant mark in the timeline of music history.~Susan J Morton. Everyone should own a copy of Middle Of Nowhere. It will be worth something some day..I can feel it. :o)"
5,Awesome,"I think that Hanson's 'Middle Of Nowhere' is a very good album. It deserves all 5 stars. If you like pop music of any kind, you should buy this album. The first single, 'MMMBop', is a very good summary of all the songs on the album. the slower songs, like 'I Will Come To You' are also very good, as are the fast songs."
2,Strange title...,"I find the title quite odd. Pokemon is the second best selling video franchise ever selling over 200 million copies. Black and white 2 sold 1.6 million in Japan alone in 2 days, and the first black and white sold 2.6 million copies in the same time period. It still has balloons in the Macy's day parade, the long running anime, cards and various merchandise. Just because it's not a relevant as it was in in 1999, doesn't mean it fell."
1,Untrue!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Hate to break it to the author but pokemon never fell!!!! Pokemon is the most popular video game of all time! It still is!It gives imformation so it isn't 0 but i can only give it one star.
1,Verbal Abuse,"This book is terrible! It talks about Pokemon like they're just Nintendo's source of customers! I absolutely hated it! You shouldn't waste your money on this, as any useful information is obscured by the horrible style in which it's written and the numerous misspellings of Pokemon species' names. Spend your money on something official and Pokemon-friendly, likePokemon Battle Revolution,Pokémon Platinum, or if you're book shopping,Ultimate National Pokedex (Pokemon Diamond Version & Pearl Version). Together, all of us can stop abusive talk and treatment of Pokemon!"
3,Hannay translation vs hongs,"I think the Hongs have done a wonderful job bringing SK to an English audience (i really found ""essential Kierkegaard"") to be a great primer to SK's thought... But this translation by them is a little outdated due to some philosophic presuppositions undertaken by the Hongs during the translation. Although Alastair Hannay's translation is really expensive... It offers a CUP translation that is more open to various interpretations of Climacus and Kierkegaard's religious beliefs.I'd also recommend the Cambridge Critical Guide, edited by Rick Anthony Furtak as a companion to CUP-- regardless which translation you use (although the guide refers to Hannay's page numbers in the citations)."
2,They are NOT SYLVANIA bulbs!,"If you want ""Bulbrite"" brand bulbs made in China than go ahead and purchase. Just dont expect Sylvania brand even though they are falsely advertised as such."
1,THIS ALBUM SUCKS: TRUE STORY!!!,"Wow I cant believe that so many people gave this s---fest 5 stars! Let me start by saying that the only two decent members (Cuban Link and Triple Seis)left terror squad due to problems with Fat Hoe but if they were still a part of the group this album would still suck. It was destined to be garbage. Fat Hoe is a disgrace to the memory of Big Pun RIP and so is Remy Fartin. If Pun was alive he wouldve b---h slapped Fat Hoe and Remy into next week. Decent tracks: YEAH YEAH YEAH, BRING EM BACK AND LET THEM THINGS GO. Filler:Lean back(phenomenal beat, lame dance record), Take You Home, Terror Era(Remy Fartin biting Big Pun. Why am I not surprised)and the rest of this album! Stay away from this album and any top 500 reviewer that would tell you its hot!"
2,True Story,"Though Big Pun is no longer in our presence, his crew ""Terror Squad"" brings his spirits with them. With Fat Joe included, they bring a story, more than you'd expect from a 5 star rap group (Sorry but DA Band was not a real rap group). The hot summer anthem ""Lean Back"" even had senior citizens pulling up there pants and doing the Roc-away. Second single ""Take Me Home"" is a catchy replica of Camron's ""Horse & Carriage"" type sound but much more sexually raw. Remy Martin is amongst the crew who has a great future ahead of her. Watch Out Now Lil Kim!!!"
2,Fat Rap,"Terror Squad seems like all the other rap performers who make MTV's top 10--they wear the usual uniform of baseball caps and oversized athletic jerseys with the expected overkill of jewelry. The only difference is that this group features corpulent singers (compared to their lean, muscular competition). The subject matter remains the same, though: partying, booze, and cheap broads (yawn)."
1,wow,"dang man if anyone out there is better than fat joe at rappin let me know, cuz this guy can rhyme like no other. i mean this guy is so good he rhymes happenins with happens, rucker with rucker, up with up and s--- with s---. wow, hes awsome. to tell you the truth this guy is a joke, hes fat he cant rap, he has no flow, he aint even black and hes usin the n word like its an everyday normal word. i mean come on spend your money on something better like gas or some classics like ""illmatic"" ""the chronic"" ""straight outta compton"" ""ready to die"" or ""all eyez on me"" if you dont already have them."
2,"Terror ""Diss""appointed","Terror Squad has ONLY two cds within the last 5 years and even less hits. ""Lean Back"" rules but nothing else does in this cd. The problem and the BIG difference with Big Pun and Fat Joe is that Big Pun always threw in some latin beats. Fat Joe you suck. Bring back Cuban Link."
1,Terror let down,"I got my hopes all up for this album to be hot, but it's a load of crap. its horrible! Maybe only two songs on this cd are worth listening to. I do not recommend buying this cd unless you won't mind wasting your money."
1,Doesn't even deserve a 1,"Generic garbage that means nothing. Fat Joe doesn't care about music- he cares about money. I was disgusted at their talentless VMA performance- no talent whatsoever. Lyrics- awful. Vocal talent? None whatsoever. Innovation? No. Musical talent? Unless you consider drum machines and synthesizers musical talent, then no. Bland, boring songs? Full effect. Anyways, the thing that disgusted me most about the VMA performance was that- at the end of the performance, the cash cow- Fat Joe, shouted ""TRUE STORY IN STORES NOW""... That speaks for itself."
4,A Job Well Done!!!,"This is a great album. Of course, my favorite track is Lean Back. Yeah Yeah Yeah, Hum Drum, Let them things go, and Terror Era are standout tracks also. Fat Joe is the best in the group, no doubt about that. But Remy Martin holds it down. She outshines the other members on most of the tracks. I cannot wait until her solo album comes out. Every hip hop fan should buy True Story. The Terror Squad brought Hip Hop back to Da Bronx."
4,Leaning back listening,"Bought the Cd today .. and Im feeling it. My fav tracks are: nothings gonna stop me, Hum Drum, Streets of NY, and of course Lean back... I just wish the other version was on here but its kewl. So Go grap a copy for your self its hot!!!"
4,Terror Squad Had Us All Leaning Back Don't Lie !!,"Ok, here is the deal on this CD. The beats are pretty tight..the lyrics have a nice flow. Too bad that ""Lean Back"" and ""Take Me Home"" were the only songs that got radio and video play. I must admit, ""Lean Back"" had people's Grandma's leaning back...it was a crazy summer banger. Since summer is coming up again, maybe they can release another 1. Unless they come up w/another gimmick, no Grammy in sight for this group."
1,OVERATED,"why must every single NY rapper always have to act like they are the most gansta people on earth. This truth is the ""lean back"" song was ok, but they are just garbage.Fat Joe is a fat stinking ass who thinks he is the hardest dude with best rhymes and he is just wack. Remy is ok but she looks (and talks) like straight up DUDE and who the hell are those other people. Maybe he should really go find puns rhyme book.Stop being all mad like u did nt know this album was going to garbage."
1,The audacity!!,"I don't appreciate Latinos using the word ""nigger"" sparingly on rap albums. (Lean Back) It is HIGHLY insulting!!!! You don't hear anybody saying ""SPIC"" or ""WETBACKS"" in raps. I particulary don't appreciate the uneducated coon Blacks for condoning it by allowing people to say things like this and act as if it's okay. This is a disgrace to Black history, culture, and hip hop!! Once again we invent something and give it away for others to exploit and capitalize off of. When will we ever get the point!!!!!!"
2,Faag joe & his girlfriends...,"I've always prefer pun over faag joe anyday even his most ""hardcore"" debut album ""jelaus one still envy"" is pretty much lame and he just goes downhill album after album with weak lirycal skills. Terror squad's "" true story"" is basically an emberresment to any latino out there and if i was latino ? I woulnt be caught dead listining to the terror swack at all. Oh yeah, remy-martin ? Whatever the f*ck her name is? Sucks coz she can't rap to save her pathetic life. If pun is looking down on faag joe? He would be nodding his head at him. Peace !"
1,Fat joe?,"Wat up man? What have u been doing lately? going corny? I used to not hate you fat man, not at all before you went all corny and now you make a dumb rap group called terror squad with lil kim? Wow, you big fat sell out. You were never really good, but now your just corny. So lean back, i said my people dont dance."
1,"Yeah, this is the reason that...","Rap is dying slowly... I mean come on let me name some bad rappers. Fat Joe, and this whole Terror Squad stuff, Lil Wyte, Ludacris and Chingy, Nelly's new stuff(I mean come on he does songs with Justin Timberlake and Tim McGraw..., Murphy Lee, Killer Mike, Outkast's new stuff. It seems like all you have to do is be a bum in the ghetto and get a mic. and all the sudden you can rap. Ok now here are some good rappers. Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, ABK, Esham, Eminem, 50 Cent, Game, Wu Tang, Camron, Bone... Rap needs to be saved and by signing a whole bunch of crappy artists every year is killing it even more, I mean I listen to a wide range of music, and I know alt about rap... and we need to shut alot of these rappers down."
1,THIS IS COMPLETE S***!!!,"Damn i didn't think rap could suck this much! If u are a rap fan then do not defile ur collection with this crap. Fat Joe is a crackhead, Remy is a b****, and the rest of them is just plain f***ed up. Use ur money on better stuff like Jadakiss, Lil Flip or Chingy or something cuz anything is better than this! Also, why is Fat Joe such a b***ard anyway?"
5,True Story: The TS TakeOver Has Begun !!!!,"Hip Hop started out in the Bronx New York , with that said fresh out the grave still brushing the dirt off comes one of hip hops most talented squads The Terror Squad !!!Just when you thought you could count them out the Terror Squad delivers a classic album. Its been years since the first TS album and like a fine wine Terror Squad only gets better with time. One Of The Hottest Albums This Year Hands Down !!! From the club to the streets to the ladies True Story has it all covered !!! If you want that real hip hop sound that has been missing from the game for so long then go buy True Story !!! TSBRONX"
4,TERROR ERA!!!,"The album is great point blank...even tho it only has 12 tracks the cd was still good..it kept me wanting more.. joe has a new style and if you havent copped the album to observe this nu style then u really need to. terror squad is doing it big and better than eva since pun'z passing. they are really representing for the latinos like all latinos should.. anywho, like ive mentioned before the cd is great and if your thinkin bout coppin it, your making a great decision! go for it!"
4,True Story-Review,"Well let me start off by saying one luv and god bless the Terror Squad Family including Big Pun. The True Story T.S. album is hands down great im feelin the tracks and beats. I'm happy to see Geddy do his thing hard on the ""Pass Away"" track its fire!!!Lean Back speaks for itself def. the summer banger this year. Overall i rate this album at 4 stars finally the crown is sitting back in NYC baby !!! great job Fat Joe, looking forward for Tony's album as well. Best wishes for all ya joe, remy, tony, prospect, geddy and the whole t.s. fam....peace im out its..... OnDaRokz"
4,Lean Back...,"I have been listening to Fat Joe for awhile now, like every other East Coast rapper, Fat Joe brings his protege. (Nas & Bravehearts, HOVA & Beanie, 50 & G-Unit, and so so) Terror Squat sound great overall. Remy really stands out because she has the sick flow and delivery and spits some sick rhymes. Rest of the crew members doesn't really stand out and they sound the same at times. Fat Joes appear on alots of the songs, although that brings up the album, it pushes the other TS members off of some of the songs. Although this album only has 12 songs, most of them are good, maybe 1 skipper. Production does a solid job, not much flaws here. Remy and Joe spits most of the punchlines, the rest of the guys are a bit left out, however its a solid album and its definitely worth the money.Lyrics: B+Production: BDelivery: BOveralL: B"
5,Very good!,"I really enjoyed this book. I found the materialclearly written and concise, the projects helpful, and was thankful for the beautifully illustrated examples and colorized source code.Unfortunately, due to the absolute ""newness"" of the Beans technology and the awkward transition point we are all suffering through as we slowly migrate to version 1.1.x of Java from 1.0.x, there are inherent frustrations with regard to browser support (or lack, thereof) and, more importantly, many of the discussed products' near-but-not-quite-there support of JavaBeans. I think the book handles these issues rather well, though.If you are seeking expert coverage into this new and amazing area of the Java Language I can't see a better place to start."
1,What a joke.,"I was looking for money management strategies and a book on how to get out of debt. What I got was ranting and raving and instructions to walk around saying ""I am a millionaire!"" This book was disappointing and filled with the name-it-and-claim it philosophy. This book will do more harm than good because it instructs readers to pray for their debts to be miraculously cancelled. The author is way too hung up on fancy clothes, expensive cars and the trappings of prosperity. There are books on the subject of money management and getting out of debt that are practical and life changing. This is not one of them."
5,Don't let a poor review of this book block your blessing!,"I was homeless at 17 and I successfully retired at 26. My pastor asked me to read and review this book as part of a program we are designing for the members of our church who are committed to becoming debt free this year. I was grateful for the opportunity and this is what I reported:Although often misunderstood to be obsessed with money, Creflo Dollar has an insight into finances that can be classified as nothing less than anointed! This book delivers sound biblical evidence for why God has promised us prosperity. In addition, it outlines clear instructions on how to move the hand of God to heal and bless your own personal financial situation. ""No More Debt"" is surprisingly practical and simple enough for even a young child to understand. But the principles here will work only for someone who has any faith at all, has tried and failed at everything else and is fed up enough to finally give God a turn."
4,It really works....,"If you know anything about the ministry of Creflo Dollar and you will not be dissapointed by this book. Once I realized that even God used the spoken Word to create the universe and man, I knew that as a child of God I must do the same. Through confession of the Word of God over my life my financial situation has reversed! I am on my way to being completely out of debt, God has given me the vision for an anointed business, and I experience the favor of God oon my life every day. If you want a step by step guide on how to pay you bills, set up a budget, get a credit report etc. get a book by John Avanzini; but it you just want to enter into a new level of prosperity get ""No More Debt"" NOW!"
5,Excellent,"If anyone finds this book offensive because they think Creflo Dollars concentrates too much on money and the trappings, then I suggest that you read the BIBLE and find that many people during that time were prosperous. He is only teaching from Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth which again is the BIBLE. It is excellent teaching for anyone who wants to get out of debt and live a more prosperous lifestyle. It's okay to be rich in all ways. If you can't deal with being rich, read The Courage to be Rich by Suze Orman it might be more to your liking because it's very technical instead of spirit filled. Dr. Dollar is for those who are filled with the spirit and have faith and belief that they ""can and will"" live better."
5,it's good,"Fly By Night is much better than many people give it credit for. It's before they really found their niche, but Neil Peart's presence on this album really adds to the songs. This album actually has a few classics. ""Anthem"" is one of their well known rock-out songs. ""By-Tor And The Snow Dog"" is their first epic song, and it's very good. ""Fly By Night"" is a song that received a little airplay. Short, but sweet. This is really good album that is a definite for Rush fans who want to see what the rock-out period of Rush was like. If you're a new fan, start with Moving Pictures."
5,Best Rush album Ever,"Neil Peart's young debut with this band , only its 2nd album ( might as well be it's 1st ) .. is absolutely the BEST Rush album in my opinion. Enthusiastic, Powerful, Inspired and Unforgettable. Rush was a new sound and this album truly does ROCK like no other."
3,The Real Beginning,"Of course, the self-titled Rush album was first, but Fly By Night sounds like a completely different band. The Rush album is pure heavy metal; Fly By Night is much more mature and developed, although with still a way to go. The band would not put out another album with this many tracks for some time, opting for longer, progressive rock compositions. (Although some, such as the 2112 suite, are merely medleys, or dare I say, 'rock operas.') I really liked this when it was released, and continued to buy Rush albums right up through Hemispheres. The band would continue to develop their craft on Caress of Steel and the hugely popular 2112, but the true peak of the band is preserved on A Farewell to Kings and Hemispheres. Check out Fly By Night for a glimpse of the road that lay ahead."
5,A Classic Rush Album,"This would be the third time I've paid money for this music. I bought it as an LP about three years after the initial release, purchased it again as a CD, and now as a download having given the CD to a new Rush fan. By far one of my favorite Rush albums. The solid rock of the title track and ""Anthem"" to a balad like ""Rivendell"" make for a marvelous mix that shows the early abilities for a band now in it's fifth decade."
5,One of my favorite Rush albums,"This album is quite a good listen. This only being Rush's second album, they did a very good job with it. This album marks the arrival of drummer Neil Peart, which turned the band in the right direction. Fly By Night begins with the hard rocking Anthem and continues with the song Best I can. Beneath, Between and Behind is the next great song that follows, with the popular By-Tor and the Snow Dog coming next. Fly By Night is the best song on the album. After that comes Making Memories, Rivendell, and In the End. which arn't as good as the preceding tracks but are still fun to listen to. In conclusion, this album is better than the debut and the album to come next..."
3,Worth a listen.,"Fly by Night is a pretty good album. The musicianship is tight. Alex Lifeson does well with the guitar work. My favorite tune is ""Fly by Night."" It's put together really well. The rest of the tracks aren't bad either. I don't consider this second album to be a personal favorite, but it has some interesting moments. I admire the album cover. The picture of the Snowy Owl is really impressive. This second release from Rush is worth a listen."
5,Rush instantly matures...,"It is very rare in rock history where the addition of one member of a band has made such a difference. As all of Rush fans know, Neil Peart joined Rush on this album, and completely changed the band's music and attitude. Their first album, while pretty good (especially Working Man), was rather run of the mill, with average drumming (from John Rutsey) and average lyrics (by Geddy Lee). When Peart joins, not only do the lyrics become excellent (written, of course, by Peart himself), but the music and playing by Lifeson and Lee grows infinitely more complex. This album is loaded with great songs, with my personal favorites being Anthem, the title track, the epic By Tor and the Snow Dog (love that title), and the magisterial In the End (one of all time favorite Rush tracks). Rush has been amazingly consistent over the years, being one of the greatest progressive rock bands ever..."
1,ONE SINGLE PURPOSE,"In the vast catalogue of RUSH, FLY BY NIGHT, their second studio album, served only one purpose: to show the world that one of the greatest rock drummers of all times, Neil Peart, arrived on the scene. Form the word go, we can see the difference between him and previous drummer John Rutsey. Peart's skill is just overwhelming. BUt this is not enough to forget about the flaws in this album. It's plain boring, bad rock, it seem they are trying to copy everything and putting together in just one song. It's a really awful album. If Rush had not changed direction soon afterwards, well.. well, maybe we would not be reviewing RUSH albuns in this site ...."
4,Building the monolith,"The foundation for the progressive rock monolith that Rush would construct throughout the 70's has its genesis with Fly By Night. The addition of Neil Peart raised the games of Alex Leifson and Geddy Lee. The arrangements are more intricate, Lee's bass is more active, and Leifson's guitar has more fire and complexity. Peart's drumming is aggressive and relentless, with a sheen of pure virtuosity that would separate him from most other rock drummers. The songs are somewhat schizophrenic, ranging from innovative musical templates for the prog-metal genre (""Anthem"", ""Beneath, Between, and Behind, and ""By-Tor & The Snow Dog""), straight-ahead rockers (""Best I Can"", ""Making Memories"", ""Fly By Night""), and ballads (the unplugged-before-MTV-made-it-hip ""Rivendell"" and the epic ""In The End""). This release provided a glimpse as to what Rush would later become, and was an introduction to the style that they would perfect on 2112."
3,NEAL'S FIRST,"Better than their first cd, FLY BY NIGHT, shows rush growing both in their lyrics (thanks to Neal) and in their playing. Anthem is a RUSH claasic, BY-thor and the Snow Dog shows their growing foundness toward drawn out rock stories, some bad, and some good, or decent, as in By-thor. Fly By Night, is a great song, but the rest of the cd, is ok.This isn't their best, by a long shot, but it shows a growth in the band, only for die hard fans."
4,Good second album from power trio,"This is a very good Rush effort, starting off with a rocker, ""Anthem"", followed by ""Best I Can"". ""By-Tor and the Snow Dog"" is a prime example of things to come on later Rush albums and is somewhat a progressive mini concept/story. Of course most people have heard the title track, which was the big hit. ""In the End"" is a great slow accoustic-electric jamming song."
4,Good album,"Rush's first album with Neil Peart this is an excellent album. Starting with ""anthem"" tooken from the philosopher Ayn Rand and having her views, although most people can probaly agree to the notions of the song without the many references of selfishness. Besides the fact that the song has a hard rocking beat to it. ""By tor and the snowdog"" is also another classic of this album, espicially with the climax instrumental section that shows much talent and effects. The gentle pace of ""rivendell"" also compliments this album alot. And of course the classic ""fly by night"""
5,early Rush Fav's,"Ok the first time I bought Fly By Night was vinyl but still love the drums. Now I've started replacing the CD's with the remastered version and sounds great. Though I always thought Niel was one of the bests. I guess one now has to distinguish between the different era's of Rush since they've been around for so long. Some may say they're pretty run of the mill, other's may say they're bit off. Whatever you might call them, there's certainly a lot to enjoy. Personally, I guess the transition for me came about around the time of Grace Under Pressure whereas some say they went commercial with Signals. But I don't care, there's a lot in the overall library to listen to over and over again. Personally, my favorites predate Grace, but was surprised but some of their more recent work. It's the thinking mans music. I'd also recommend 2112."
4,It All Came Together Here,"This is the album where all the parts fell together for the first time. They are starting to develop their signature sound here, and although they aren't quite there yet, they will come even closer on the next album, Caress of Steel, and reach it's zenith with 2112. There are many classics here: the title track, By Tor & The Snow Dog, Anthem, In The End, and some others, none are bad. The changing in the drum throne is very obvious, Neil's playing is virtoustic even on this, his first album with the band. This was their best album up until the release of 2112, and remains a classic. You should get some others first, of course, but you should buy this album too... eventually."
3,Excellent follow up and a preview of things to come!,"First of all, I wish you could give 1/2 stars, because I really wanted to give this album 3.5 stars instead of 3.Rush's second album is a different direction from their debut album. Obviously, the addition of Neil Peart helped this along, but I think the band was probably already going in this direction musically anyway. Peart's lyrics are certainly more interesting than the ""baby baby"" lyrics found on the first album. This is a very solid album with no real ""dogs"" on it (the closest thing to a ""dog"" would be Rivendell). ""By-Tor and the Snowdog"" is a good first example of the type of epic and complicated song that Rush would become famous for throughout the 70's, up through the Hemispheres album.Other highlights are ""Anthem"", ""Fly by Night"", and ""In the End"". Overall this is a solid album, but not in the same league as the other albums that Rush did in the 70's (""2112"", ""Farewell to Kings"", etc.)"
1,not very good,"my product came with a little crack and it was more expensive than showed me the site, but the cd's ok."
2,A MIRACLE,"By listening to FLY BY NIGHT, you keep wondering that it was a miracle a band like this ever reached mega stardom. THe album is a cheap copy of Led Zeppelin or whatever influences Lee and Lifeson had at the time. FLY BY NIGHT has some few good tunes (very few), but their sound is atrocious, Lee's singing is a shame, Lifeson's guitar is witha bad tone and Peart's drums are totally out of place."
5,Instant classic,"Being a relatively long term fan of the progressive scene, I'm almost ashamed to have not stumbled upon rush till now. I can really see why these guys get their dues from the bands of the last 20 years... A great album to show off the amazing talents of this dedicated trio. Long live rush!"
4,underrated classic,"this is my favorite rush album.every song on this album is good {the only exception being rivendell }the song anthem is one of my favorite tracks off all time.beneath between and behind,fly by night and by -tor and the snow dog are also very good songs.i also love the album cover, i don't know if it 's just me but i think it's one of the coolest album covers ever.this is a difinite hard rock classic,one i would recommend to everyone."
3,Has some good moments.,"I'm not a huge fan of Fly By Night, but it still isn't bad. My favorite song would have to be the title song ""Fly By Night."" That's a good song. The album art is very impressive with the snowy owl--great album cover. I'm really more into their '80s stuff. Not a favorite album, but not bad."
5,Memory serves!,"This album is just as great as I remember it!I love ""themed"" albums, and this is one of the best! By-Tor and the Snow Dog Takes the Genre of Tolkien, and makes it their own! Rivendell is a wonderful tip of the hat in that direction!"
2,Faceless,"This is an album where Rush was still clearly trying hard to find its own personality. Geddy did not know if he should sing or scream, Peart did not know exactly what to write about, Lifeson did not know when to restrained and when to be for a flat-out shredding.All of the songs has its moments, but none of them are memorable in the way their classic albums are. BY THOR & THE SNOW DOG begins well, but then becomes one of the worst ""epic"" songs I've ever heard.Anyway, RUSH is rich, I am poor, and that's because they are some of the best rock band ever, and I'm not!!"

5,Laugh until your jaw hurts!,"A must read for Hedo newbies or seasoned vets! Having enjoyed reading both of these publications, I can only impress once again my thoughts to my fellow amazon.com buyers to read it and you will not be able to put it down! Chris Santilli is an incredible author and interprets the fun, excitement and informative side of Hedo through her research and her own experiences. This Canadian will be looking for more of her work!"
2,"Not much more ""bang for the buck""","If you've got the second edition - you don't need this edition. There's only a few new photos and stories, not up to the hype of the publisher. Save the money for your next vacation."
5,A beginners guide to Hedonism II,"As head of a 30 couple group that goes to Hedonism yearly for the past 14 years, I have found the book to be of great help to first time visitors. A lot of the information is close to what I give to people who ask me about the resort and what to exspect when they arrive. Now when I am asked I tell them the best thing to do is to buy the book. It is packed with just about everything you need for an enjoyable stay at Hedonism II."
4,Right on target!,"As a frequent visitor to Hedo II, I was delighted by the 1st edition of TNTAH2. However, after a few years, I succumbed to the need to update, and bought 2nd Edition (2004 update). Sure, a lot of the material (like the helpful hints and what to bring) is the same as in the first publication - as it should be. What the author has done is exactly what she promises: an update. It's funny, silly, irreverent and iconoclastic. To my mind, the author's breezy ""in-your-face"" style is completely suited to talking about Hedo II, one of the most outrageous (and occasionally maligned) destinations in the Caribbean.If you've not seen the book before, go immediately to the 2004 update. If you've already bought 2nd edition, wait for the next major overhaul - which I'm sure will be forthcoming.Above all, read the book if you've never been. It's almost as good as being there! But not quite."
5,Every Hedo Virgin Needs to Read This Book,"Having just finished this book and having also just returned from my first trip to Hedo I wish I would have read it before I went as I would have been so much more prepared.Everything Chris says is amazingly accurate and so helpful (from theme nights, to the food, to the amazing staff, to the extra strong gravity around Delroy's bar) and perfectly articulates how Hedo changes you forever."
2,Premature publication......,"Sorry but the latest edition is not really updated for 2004. The hotel is undergoing major renovations so the update is very premature. 2005 would have been better. Why the rush? A few new photos of the author and her sig/other and some small facts don't make the sale. We purchased the book at the hotel. Ifyou've been and got the first or second book, you're fine."
4,"The Naked Truth About Hedonism II (2nd Edition, Updated for","If you're contemplating a trip to HedoII this is the book for you. Don't believe anything you see on the Springer shows. This IS the truth and hilarious to boot! If I'm every down in the dumps, I pick this book up and read a chapter or two. Makes me feel better instantly! Chris has a way with words like none other I know. Can't wait for the 3rd edition!"
4,Nekkid truth,"This was a very helpful book before I went to Hedo II. It certainly disspelled a lot of my ideas about Hedo II and gave me a pretty reasonable set of expectations on what awaited me at Hedo II. As any good board (like Denny Pasternak's) will tell you, if you're going for hook-up heaven and you're a single male between 21-29, then this is not the place for you (try Contiki); however, if you just want to go have a good time, play a lot of games, drink, and enjoy a beach au naturale, this is the place for you. Chris's book was very accurate and on the mark. I'd like to see if she does one for Hedo III."
5,"Fun loving accounts of Hedo's special adult ""summer camp""","Ms. Santilli writes with clear information relative to one thinking of traveling to Hedonism. Anyone who is contemplating spending the sum of money necessary to travel to Hedonism II, should first spend $19.95 to buy the book as it is a complete manual for the trip. Ms. Santilli describes the rooms, the food, what to wear and when to wear it. I certainly wish I had this book before my first trip to Hedonism II."
5,Entertaining as well as informative,"As a repeat guest of Hedonism II, I really did not need a ""guide"" to the resort. But I thought I'd read the book to see the resort from a different perspective. I found the book to be enlightening, accurate, funny and quite interesting. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has been, or has ever thought of going to Jamaica."
2,"An ""R"" rated after-school special","This has got to be the most heavy-handed, patronizing film of all time. The performances of all the teenagers (especially the one who played the daughter) were cheesy and laughable. I was surrounded by snickers when I saw this in the theatre.Even more ridiculous is just how much people go on about the ""realistic"" portrayal of the drug problem. Realistic? Douglas just happens to become nation's drug czar at the same time that his daughter becomes a drug-obsessed, skid row prostitute--while maintaining ""all A's"" at her exclusive prep school. When her husband gets thrown in the can, Zeta-Jones transforms overnight from happy housewife to sangfroid assassin and drug queen. I'm sure we can all relate.If it weren't for that enlightening Orrin Hatch cameo, this would've been just another one-star wonder."
2,hard to follow.,I am not going to take the time to tell you what this was about. Basically because I have no clue myself. This movie was so freaking hard to follow. It was SO long. I guess I understand. The guy finally realized his family was more important than his job and drugs can have an effect on even the most unsuspecting families and pepole. But holy man make it like and hour and a half amd save me the time. Perhaps if I watch this again it will make more sense to me. This was a good movie I think. They just made it hard to follow. Going from one story to another. Over and over. Give it a try I guess.
2,whats the fuss,"i bought this movie and it was the only movie that i have ever bought that i wanted to return,it came across as a documentary,and to much spanish ,for my liking,whats the fuss with this movie."
2,Best Picture Nominee?,"Having heard that this should have been the Best Picture winner for 2000, I was extremely disappointed instead. The movie was long, dull and at times very predictable. However, the portions of the movie that featured Catherine Zeta Jones and Benicio Del Toro were decent. Benicio Del Toro's Oscar was well deserved. The Michael Douglas portion was right out of any bad 80's movie about the ""horrors of drug abuse"". Forget about best picture honors, how the heck did it even get nominated? As far as DVD's go, this was pathetic. Rent it for curiosity, but don't waste the money buying it."
3,Doesn't deserve the hype,"Overall, the movie was good at best. I am a huge movie fan, but this one is only worth watching once.I was impressed with Benicio Del Toro, who pulled off his most subtle performance yet.He should have gotten the Oscar for his role in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" rather than for this movie.Catherine Zeta-Jones was exceptional in her role, which in my opinion was the most interesting character in the movie.If you have heard lots about it, but haven't seen it yet...forget everything you've heard and go in expecting very little.If you've never heard of it before, then I suggest watching it, it may, or may not, be your cup of tea."
1,you got to be kidding me!,This may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot goes nowhere. There is no action per-say. The acting wasn't that great. I can't belive this film won 4 acadamy awards. Bottom line this film was realy bad!
2,The war on drugs?,"This movie is interesting in the way that it portrays the cross section of real life as opposed to what the government has been putting forth. While it is a timely subject given our ongoing efforts in the area I'm afraid the whole feel of it and the acting just did not work for me.Douglas does his usual good work and there are good performances by others but perhaps it's more just the way it was directed. It did not strike me as having a feel of authenticity, it was too obviously contrived. It strikes me as not being one of those movies that makes you want to get inside it and believe, it does not create the sort of empathy feeling one might have for a Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan (admittedly a tough comparison of course).Possibly worth a rental but with all the tens of thousands of titles out there I have to say I would not rate it terribly high. No serious political commentary, no memorable or outstanding theatrical element."
3,could have been much better...,"Good movie, yes. Best movie, definitely not.I didn't see the movie until it came out on DVD. With all the reviews and excellent ratings, I expected much much much more than what i got. I guess i should have seen at the movies rather than getting it for 25 bucks on DVD... The casting is good but the movie is really slow at times...Rent it, don't buy it."
2,can you say 'gloss'?,"soderberg is probably one of the most over rated directors working today. if you want to make a film with a 'documentary' feel why not get someone who knows how to shot it, like say i don't know a documentary filmaker? but that is not the point. this movie glosses over, and not very well, the issue and problem of drugs and politics. it presents it as a cute problem that needs to be nipped in the bud. pure ...! the only reason it gets 2 stars is because as always benecio del toro was very good and convincing. over all, highly over rated(i would venture to say the most over rated apart from gladiator-at least that was amusing). and would someone please be an honest and intelligent person and agree."
1,boring!blah!blah!boriiiiiiiiiiiiing,"I fast forwared through most of this movie, I only rented it be-cause of all the hype. I enjoy most of the movies that I rent, but this one was so boring that I felt like I should've gotten my money back..!! The movie had to many plots, the color was hideous, and it dragged on forever,what a WASTE OF TIME."
2,ummm? where are the features,"1. Take off two stars for no commentary 2. Take off another star for not including the original television mini-series. The DVD format just begs for these kinds of extra goodies. Why are they not included?Fans of this great movie deserve more than this. It's too bad. I guess we'll just have to wait for the ""special limited collectors' edition""."
1,Traffic,"Perhaps we are the only people in the country who were dramatically disappointed in the hype regarding Traffic and all of the awards it received, but to our family we found it to be boring, tedious and uneventful. There are much better movies out there."
3,"Bad Image, everything else is great","I don't mind if the BluRay is double sided or if they offer two or more Discs. I do care about buying a movie in BluRay movie and get subpar quality.The movie is VERY good, the audio (DTS 5.1) and subtitles are VERY good.The video quality is very poor, I know the film was supposed to be grainy, I own the DVD and I saw the movie in the Theaters, but the transfer makes the grain move like ants.IF, in the future, Universal decides to take things seriously and make a better transfer; I'll buy it because the movie is so good.Meanwhile, I think I prefer to watch it on DVD than in BluRay.I love it when movies are released in BluRay format, I really can't wait for many titles to be released in this format, but please, Studios should build credibility for this format by doing it RIGHT, not just GOOD ENOUGH. Is this the new AMERICAN Mentality?"
2,Disappointingly Vacuous Disc,"I was really looking forward to a director's commentary (and maybe even deleted scenes) for this particular film, but apparently it's not to be. Bronkovich lacks likewise. He must really be busy on Ocean's Eleven. Soderbergh's comment track on Out of Sight is one of the most insightful and entertaining I've heard yet on DVD."
2,Not Much Movement,"Traffic is an average movie which does not inspire enough interest to get out of that pigeon hole. It deals with many stories and they are all related on some way, obviously the director was watching some foreign films, for this is nothing new. Most of the stories are preposterous, take for example the wife of a drug dealer, in a few weeks she is talking to dangerous drug leaders in Mexico as if she knew what she was doing. Also, the drug czar wandering around in the ghettos of Baltimore, these scenes do not add up and as a result the film is mostly a compendium of utter boredom that drags on."
3,Not Convinced,"The whole concept of Traffic is good but i can't help feeling that it could of been portrayed better. The cast list was good, Catherine Zeta Jones was excellent as the unjust house wife who later joins in with her husbands business. The film is about drugs and how the Americans and the Mexicans are trying to stop the war on drugs. The film keeps swopping from Mexico and America so many times that the person that i went with got all confused and that ruined the film for her. The plot of the film was good so i can't slate that i just wish that it wasn't all over the place. Overall i would see the film again but i won't be my alltime favourite."
5,Remarkable,"Thought provoking, suspenseful, illuminating and candid. Actors love working for Steven Soderbergh and it shows. Each role was well developed and fully realized on screen. This movie is powerful!"
3,Great Cast,"While the shaky editing of ""Traffic"" took some time to get used to, I nevertheless enjoyed this movie. Most of the stories being told within the film are interesting and the cast was superb. Benicio Del Toro deserved his Oscar and Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman were hilarious as DEA agents. While ""Traffic"" can get boring at times, it still lingers in memory."
3,ok.,"nothing special. it drug on a bit. i like the directing andacting is great, but the plot was pretty loose, and if i lookhard, i bet i can find some holes.the music is mediocre at best.the worst part of it all is the way it downplays drugs andaddiction. yes, i agree that drugs are horrible, but the factof the matter is, its personal choice, and the government isblowing absurd amounts of money on stopping drugs.someone else said it's like a 2 hour ""this is your brain ondrugs"" comericial. exactly.its still a good movie, though, and i suppose it's worth a look-see. if you're over 16."
1,"Hello, character development?","What do you get when you add a lack of character development, a weak plot, bad acting, and a horrible editing job? Traffic. I don't even want to write about how bad this movie was, because I don't want to waste more of my life in addition to the two and a half hours a spent watching this film."
2,Traffic jam,"Please people, get over this movie. Just because the director uses a ""neat"" tint to the film and runs around with a hand cam does NOT a great picture make. Think of Godfather III, looked like a Godfather film, smelled like a Godfather film, but it was terrible. Don't be tricked into this ridiculously average film. I'll give you the fact that Benicio does his best to save this picuture (he is always great), but it's more than even he could overcome. First of all, some spoiled rich kid would not go to the ""hood"" to buy dope. They'd have some guy like James Spader's character in Less Than Zero to buy from. Also please explain how Ms Zeta-Jones goes from a naive tennis club wife to Don Corleone in a span of 2 minutes? Lastly, the speech between Michael Douglas and his daughters friend in the car almost tossed my red vines. Possibly the most overrated film of the last 10 years."
1,Like a film school project,"This movie is long... really long. I felt like I was watching a film student's project. The cheap gimmick of the different colors for the different settings served little purpose. Also, the handheld camers shots did little to add to the feel of the movie. The numerous characters were never really developed to a point where I had an interest in any of them. I really couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them (maybe that was the point of the movie - but it made me quickly lose interest). Even a wonderful performance by Benicio Del Toro couldn't save this movie. This movie was written from the point of view of someone who observed drug culture in the 70s. Many of the situations seem to reflect the attitudes of that era and not what is going on in the year 2000-1. After seeing the previews I really wanted to like Traffic, but it seriously let me down."
3,Great film - wrong HD image to show-off,"Traffic is difficult for me to review since I really enjoyed the film but before you purchase be aware that the intent of the Director is to deliver a grainy, washed-out picture throughout the film. In the places where Traffic is intended to deliver an oustanding picture without washed-out images it certainly does.Images of the early bust, courtroom and 'life at home' are rich and detailed - via projector in 1080i.If you appreciate the story and have a nice system, Traffic in HD is a good investment; it is NOT the movie to show-off your new High Definition home Theater system; for that I would recommend The Searchers, Seabiscuit, King Kong or Casino in HD-DVD."
3,Why did the chicken cross the road?,"I dunno. But anyway about the film...Ok, I had to watch it twice before I figured out what was going on and even then I figured, what was the point? It's a really long movie anyway. The most irritating thing about it was the way it suddenly ended - I won't tell you how, I'll keep you in suspense. Basically, the movie's about a three way competition between two drug cartels (Juarez and Tijuana) and the US DEA, FBI, ETC ETC blah blah...I got irritated with the general too. I forget his name though. Javier was cool, though.Ok, so what did you learn about the movie from this review? Absolutely nothing. And that's what you'll learn from the movie too..."
5,wake up call,This film should serve as a wake up call for our complete defeat in the drug war. Drugs are terrible but have always and will always exist and this film perfectly outlines that point. Amazing performances all around. I hope the real drug tsar owns this film.
3,PRETTY GOOD MOVIE....BAD ENDING,"THE PERFORMANCES IN TRAFFIC ARE EXCELLENT. IT IS A STRONG FILM, HOWEVER, THE ENDING IS A DISAPPOINMENT. NOT WORTH BUYING BUT GOOD TO RENT IF YOU HAVE THE PATIENCE TO SIT DOWN FOR OVER TWO HOURS AND YOU DON'T MIND SUBTITLES."
3,"Predictable Movie......but very good acting, all around...","I went to the theatre before the Oscars to see Traffic, I came out liking the moving but as the days wore on after the Oscars, I see why it was not the Best Picture. The moving did not tell anything that anyone does not know about the usage and affects of drugs on all participants all around. The one thing that it did shed light on is a cop who was not compromised by money and that is not something you see everyday (del Toro's oscar winning performance, deservedly). Other than that, it was predictable. What pulled this movie off was the performances from Michael Douglas, the girl who played his daughter (she was very good), Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, on down the line....and one other thing, I am glad of the way Soderburgh used the lighting for each story intertwined, very good effect. I am disappointed that for over $20 you do not get any commentary from the director, actor or writer....for this I may wait for the special edition release."
3,the Most Over-rated film of 2000! By Far!,"The acting was ok.....Catherine Zeta-Jones and Don Cheadle were the best, but Benicio Del Toro wasn't great.The film was pretty.... not very good, it was ok i guess.im really mad that Ang Lee didn't win Best Director...CTHD was the best movie of 200 hands down(with Billy Elliot and Almost Famous)...dont expect this to be great because it isn't!"
3,Traffic,"It was entertaining enough to let it run to the end but I thought it lacked a lot in continuity and left a lot to fill in,Also was not particularly impressed with Mr Douglas's performance"
3,sorry to have bought it,"the movie is not bad, but it is not particularly interesting either. drug trafficking / war on drugs - the story is so old, it makes your eyes drop while watching the movie. but instead of one boring story, you get a package, featuring different characters with different boring stories (actually, these ""different"" stories are generally all the same). why this movie got an oscar makes me only shrug my shoulders. who knows? by the way, who wants this dvd? I coincidentally have one I want to get rid off - only 10 cents, I think you can't charge more for this movie, even if you buy it on dvd. :-) keep smiling!"
1,I've seen better film on teeth,"Hands down this the worst movie I have ever seen, long boring, I fell asleep 6 times. I wanted to leave before the end, but my wife wanted to ride this lemon out. A terrible film, a terrible waste of talent, I have seen better film on teeth. If you want or need a nap, then by all means, watch this lousy unbearable tedious lemon of a movie."
1,traffic,"My husband and I love Michael's movie. But this one is the worst of the worst movie that he had even made. His wife look so old and ugly, we can hardly believe ourselves that it's her in the movie. not worth the effort to watch it at all..trust me.."
2,Strange Movie To Understand,"I really just can't get into Traffic. The movie seemed to bore me and just could not follow it. Usually I enjoy most of Michael Douglas's films but this one is probably my least favorite of any he has done. I tried watching it a second time and still just kept boring me for some reason. It did remind me of say 'Crash' or 'Pulp Fiction' in how different stories try to interlock but kept getting lost in them. I would have to look back at the 2000 academy award competition since it won a few awards but guess some people found the movie great, I didn'tPeter J. Miller"
1,Snoozer,"This film can be accurately summarized with one word: BORING.I'm getting sick and tired of getting suckered in by these ""star-studded"" and ""award winning"" movies. If this ""movie"" can get four academy awards then a movie documenting cars rusting should be able to easily qualify for eight academy awards."
1,Better off renting 'Gladiator',this movie was INCREDIBLY boring. it's a waste of 2 1/2 hours. You're better off with Gladiator or even Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon
5,drug traffic,"This movie was awesome, just to see how corrupt people can be. I highly recommend this flick! You should buy this movie."
4,Great movie... but worth the price?,"I love this movie, and this dvd is a great representation of what I saw in the theatire with clear picture and sound, as well as a few nice extras... The only reason i gave it a 4/5 is that I still feel kind of weird about laying down ($) for a 2 hour long anti-drug commercial. Its a really REALLY good anti-drug commercial, but basically an anti-drug commercial nonetheless.I felt so weird about it infact that I wasn't able to buy it for myself (especially after laying down ($) to see it in the theatre). But I was given it as a gift and am very grateful... Sorry for the sort of mixed message but this is a very thought provoking movie and it tends to bring that out in people."
4,Good Movie,It was a suspenseful yet sad movie about the drug cartels in South America and their influence here in the US. It was very well made.
4,Valuable Film,"Character, decision-making, love, honor, deceit, trust....all are put into question in Traffic, a powerful and moving film.....to go along with the many beautiful and honest teachings of this movie, the structure of the film is captivating as well, with inter-related stories being told simultaneously....the performances are strong, the directing and storyline even stronger...traffic is an honorable mention in my book...it is worth seeing"
1,Overrated,"This is another case of movie star names selling a movie. If I had heard about this movie WITHOUT being told who was starring in it, I never would have bothered seeing it. But, I did see it! At first, it seemed riveting and interesting but after a couple of hours, the only good parts were Benicio Del Toro's scenes. The story was boring and far-fetched and in my opinion, this was a hyped up bunch of hot-air. For example, I've never seen a government official break down at a press conference because his daughters on drugs. Come on! Don't insult our intelligence. And drugs being transported as fully constructed dolls made of cocaine! Hmmmm, what happens if someone sweats on one of the dolls? This movie wouldn't even fool a kid let alone an adult. Terrible."
2,this might be giving this credit,"Despite a good cast.I almost wonder why they took the job.this is dull and the direction is mishandled .3 stories at once which both relate and don't relate too eachother.If this wasn't a drug movie it whould most likely be a surething for an acadmy...lol well to sum this up it's saying no matter how hard the goverment tries they can't win the war on drugs.Perhapps i missed something some where but this gives a negative message.I generally round up reveiws butthis one im ust round down.It does have some funny moments ,but seethis if yourinto watching people pretend to get off on the stuff.Nap time anyone?"
1,illegal version from the dealer!!!!!!,"I'm so disappointed to what i got from the dealer. The version i bought is a ""Criterion collection"" with 2 discs special edition. But what the dealer mailed me was not just a single disc edition. But it also the illegal version!!!! the dealer printed the cover by himself and it doesn't fit the box at all.The disc inside the box wrote ""disc 2"". obviously the ""Disc 1"" is disappeared!!!! (I can provide photos to prove it)And in the delivery description dealer wrote was from UK. but finally it was mailed from Mexico. It made me need to pay extra 16 Pounds for the VAT and handling fee costs!!!!I definitely request to refund including the VAT fee.What an irresponsible dealer!!!!!!"
1,Double sided disc bad!!,"States that will play on DVD, BLU-RAY & PS3!!Does not fit in ps3 slim had to void ps3 warranty to remove disc does not fit in my Philips DVD player or Sony and Samsung blu-ray players!!!!!"
3,Traffic,"Enjoyed this movie , but not a movie I would recommened as a must ownon HD dvd. Looked just as good on dvd."
2,It's not a thriller..,"I rent this film because of the names, the 4 Oscars and the description as a thriller.It's a fair story but not a thriller!Furthermore, the part of judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas)was not of any importance the way it was presented. To be more interesting, it should have been more developed, I think.I expected he would be more personal, more involved in the plot than just visiting the general in Mexico. And his daughter was addicted...so? He sent her to the group...so? The wife's part was completely absent and inactive as a mother...We could live without. The film itself is a drama. Not an action film or a thriller as we were presented by the trailers. Sorry, gyus!"
2,Boring !,"Traffic is easily the least entertaining of the 5 best picture nominees in 2001 oscar and I am so pleased it didn't win the best picture. Why Steven Soderbergh won an oscar for this one instead of Erin Brockovich is beyond me. The story about DEA war against Tijuana drug cartel. The movie itself is boring and way too long (listed at 147 Mins). And for some reasons, the picture is presented in 3 different color setting for each plot line so Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta Jones, and Benicio Del Torro all have 3 different colors. The DVD itself is OK. Picture is sharp and the Dolby Digital 5.1 is ok as most of this movie is dialogue anyway. If you have heard good things about this movie, it did win 4 oscars, rent this first before you buy as this is not as good as what the critics said."
2,boring,"I watched this movie because of all the hype it got when it was in theaters. It ought to be called something like, ""a day in the life of the drug trade."" There are a lot of characters, none of whom is really developed. The cast is apparently working as an ensemble, with no main plot and no main character; just a bunch of minor intersecting story lines. Partly as a result, no character and no plot was interesting or engaging. Also, the camerawork which showed scenes in D.C. under a blue filter and scenes in mexico under a yellow filter (so signify heat?) which i assume was supposed to be artsy, was mostly just irritating."
3,"Mexico, si - Michael Douglas, no","The wonderful cinematography aside, Traffic is really two movies. The totally believable and gritty story of drug traffic on the border, the unbelievable Hollywood story of Michael Douglas and his daughter. Watch this film for Benicio del Toro, especially the too-brief scene in Tijuana (actually filmed in Nogales) where a young US couple tries to pay off del Toro to help finding their car, and he just refers them to the policia. Poor rich Douglas, his daughter mired in drugs, plays like a TV movie of the week. Any US drug czar wouldn't waste time crusing the drugs streets with another kid user. Instead, the wrath of God would descend on the whole drug scene. Moral of this movie seems to be that if you're white, US, and wealthy, you can solve your problems through family counseling. If you're Hispanic, watch out, the movie doesn't even pretend to offer solutions. If I lived in Mexico along the border, I'd be really furious at the politics of this movie"
5,Very well done,"Especially the kid - Chrisenson. She did an incredible job of portraying the addict, and what one will do to feed the addiction.A well acted flick with enough of a plot albeit convoluted at times.great for a weekend viewing, or a matinee' if still in theatres!"
5,Must Have,"I missed this movie in the theatre, but now I own the DVD. This is a must have DVD. It will grab you by the throat and won't let go. When the ending credits started rolling at the end of the movie, I found myself still glued to my TV, wondering why the movie was so short! Then I looked at the time and discovered that the movie was 2 hours and 20 minutes. This is a great movie. Douglas is at the top of his acting. There are a lot of people in this movie, there are different stories about different families, but it is easy to keep track of all of them, and get lost in the middle. The picture on the DVD is very good, and the 5.1 DD sound will not make your ear drums explode but it matches the movie perfectly. Like I said, this is a must have movie."
3,The dream that has become a nightmare,Ask yourself this: A) What kind of an id_ot would refer to the President of the US of A as the leader of the free world? This has got to be a joke...right? ...RIGHT??B) The only thing that will provide a safe future for Mexico's new generation is... Baseball? (you gotta be kidding me).The movie itself isn't that bad. In fact it sometimes crosses over politically correct into thereal American (sick) way of life of the last 25 years.All in all this is a [weak] ... movie with loads of crocodile tears shed in the end and an all star team of actors trying their best to save what was once called The American Dream and has now become The Worlds WORST Nightmare ...
1,Sloppy narrative,"Three things: 1. If Catherine Zeta-Jones never knew about her husband's business, how did she get so good at running it so fast? 2. Whenever the film went to Mexico, why was everything pinkish-orange? 3. How did Michael Douglas leave the White House press room so easily without passing anybody?This film is terribly overrated. I can't believe it got the notices it did. The DVD is not unique in any way; typical stuff like behind the scenes and trailers. I would have liked commentary. (Even though I think if a film is made well enough, it doesn't have to be explained.)"
5,Incredibly rich and provocative story with a very important message,"Steven Soderbergh's Traffic is, in my opinion, a well put-together masterpiece. It is a film that truly shows off the talent of its director and its stars in a completely interesting way. The acting is top-notch (be sure to look for Don Cheadle and Louis Guzman as two DEA agents and Steven Bauer as a California drug lord) and the cinematography is excellent. I would easily recommend Traffic to anyone interested in learning how to make a movie. 5 Stars"
2,Barely tolerable,"I saw a sneakpeek of this one shortly before it came out, and wow, was I not able to predict the way it would be received. Soderbergh shows a surprisingly uneven hand with his storylines. Del Toro is good, but he's been (and will be, no doubt) much better. Michael Douglas is, surprise surprise, Michael Douglas. And Zeta-Jones is not as deft an actress as she is stunning. Sorry, but it's true. My main problem with the film, however, has to do with the overall approach. It reminds me of Natural Born Killers, in which Oliver Stone tried to make a point about how popular culture makes us numb to violence by making a movie equally numbing. Interesting point, but not an enjoyable film experience. Similarly, Traffic seems to address the ""the drug problem is really complex and seemingly unresolvable"" idea by making a movie as muddy and tangled as its topic."
1,No Entertainment Value,"Although I agree that this movie has a unique storyline, that's all this movie has. The writing may have been incredible, but I'm no critic, so I'm not rating this movie on that. I'm a common moviegoer, so I rated this movie based on entertainment value. This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was bored multiple times while watching this movie. Right from the beginning, the storyline was too difficult to grasp. Even the two friends I was watching this movie with agreed that this movie was the exact opposite of entertaining. The media may have hyped this movie up, but it definitely did not gain popularity by common word of mouth like most great movies. I would definitely not recommend this movie to somebody in the mood for watching something entertaining. The only reason you may want to watch this movie is for it's uniqueness."
5,You must see this!,"First of all, if you haven't seen it yet, see it! And if you have seen it, see it again! This is about the drug-wars (I don't want to give too much away) but this movie is one of the most realistic movies you will ever see. The acting is phenomenal. One of best movies of decade!"
5,Five Stars,"Wow, This movie is powerful. It Involves the delicate weaving of Three main storylines into one all encompassing tapestry of movie making excellence. Now with big words aside, its a great movie. The cast is terrific and they all work well together the on screen chemistry in this movie is astounding. (woops big word) It tells a story that is so full of under dealings, double crosses, betrayal, addiction, and even murder that it has to be some of that hollywood storytelling right? I don't think so there isn't one part of this movie that I don't believe is true or couldn't be true. That is a rarity in today's movie making industry. Excellent acting, Great screenplay, Good Cinematography, Fantastic Direction all with a solid musical score means this movie is worth FIVE STARS!"
4,Five star film but a three star DVD,"This was an excellent movie, probably better than the one that one the Oscar (Gladiator). Great performances, direction and a great script. Unfortunately, the DVD was bare-bones, with only a very short feature. They may come out with a special (""untimate,"" ""transcendent"" or whatever they will be calling them that month) edition one day, so I would wait awhile before buying. I'd definitely rent it though, because it is a very entertaining film."
1,"Okay, this is my second attempt...........","...Traffic is a monstrous dissapointment. I hate this movie. It is just a preachy, campy film produced by user/losers of the Hollywood psuedo-elite who spend 23 hours a day trying to get drugs legalized so that they can get high without fear of being arrested. The film is incoherrent and has the feel of a classic cut and paste job. I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on..."
1,"overhyped , overbloated , boring , dribble","Why? Why? Why? was this movie considered a great accomplishment and an in depth study on the war on drugs. This movie was nothing more than boring , and long , and I found myself dozing off here and there during it. The only interesting story was Douglas and his daughter , the mexican cop , and the druglord's wife were boring and a waste of film. If the movie was about the czar and his daughter it may have earned at least 3 stars , and whats worse it'll switch characters to characters like about every minute , so you can't keep up with it. A 3 hr waste of time even though it had one of the coolest lines when the actor from That 70's Show and the czar's daughter are on the bed smoking heroin. Whats even more disgusting this film won an Oscar. It's trash like this that try to be groundbreaking and prove a point of some kind , but does nothing more than suck 3 hrs out of your life. Nauseating dribble"
2,Disappointing and distorted.,"It's nice to see Hollywood tackle a serious issue, and the Drug War is one of the most serious issues there is.Sadly, Traffic offers a distorted view of reality. Cocaine is presented here as an overwhelming, almost demonic force. Viewers might never guess that cocaine is actually very similar to alcohol, in that only a minority of users ever become addicts.Worse yet, Traffic seems overtly racist and insulting to Mexicans and African-Americans. The scene where the black drug dealer in the ghetto dopes up the rich white girl and has sex with her is like something out of Archie Bunker's nightmares.Yet it's all done with a gritty, raw style that is quite accomplished and impressive. It's too bad this talent serves such mean ends."
2,Hollywood destroys another classic story.,"When I watched this it reminded me what I thought of The Assassin (Bridget Fonda). In that case an absolute classic movie Nikita was destroyed with a mind numbing version for the US audience. It's happened again here with Traffik becoming remade as Traffic. Traffic won all the awards and took all the money buy you owe it to yourself to watch Traffik, the original."
2,A tired movie with a tired DVD,"What were the studios thinking when they designed this DVD? It was like it was made in 1993 or something. I've gone more exciting DVD title screens from movies I bought for $10.00. Beside that the hoopla about Traffic was not at ALL warranted. The movie was WAY TOO LONG!!!!!! It was like someone got a hold of a bad movie of the week mini series and decided to put it in a feature film. The transparent efforts to make this movie""artsy"" were a TOTAL waste and just made the movie look worse than it all ready did. This movie was truly unsurprising and I could have probably told you the end by the middle. It was TRULY a WASTE of my time. PLEASE DON'T EVEN RENT THIS MOVIE!!! It will be a portion of your life you'll never get back. It certainly depressed me..."
1,"Well, I don't speak Spanish..","Unfortunately, I had seen the British TraffiK which was great. I suppose if I could understand the language the American Traffic might have been OK, but I couldn't really stay up with the subtitles. I think about 60 per cent was in Spanish. I need new glasses or a larger tv, or quick enough to hit the pause....Oh, well, the British film spoiled me so I'm a bit grouchy!"
1,"An Unpowerful Drama, Unimportant Film",This Movie Started off Good then turned to Trash half way through. Who ever believed Michael Douglas & Catherine Zeta in their roles? After Don Cheadles partner gets killed the film gets boring very fast. Another Over Hyped Movie that shouldn't of won as many awards as it did.
2,"OK, not as good as all the hype.","I was a little disapointed in the ending it just left the audience hanging. I thought the movie was somewhat boring, however it was very accurate in many ways and in many other areas it was very HOLLYWOOD. I understand the effect the director was trying to create, but the harsh lighting and colors combined with the way the movie was filmed just made it all the more difficult to focus on the movie. If you want to see a movie about the Mexican/American drug problem, you will be pleased to know this movie is more accurate than people think, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at the movie theater. If you are curious about this movie, rent it so if you get too bored you can still turn it off and return it without wishing you hadn't bought it."
2,why did this win acadamy awards?,"I just didn't like this movie at all. I know it's supposed to portray the problems with drugs in our society, but could it be any more boring? I don't know why Benicio del Torro won anything for his performance...(he was better in ""The Way of the Gun""). I probably won't watch it ever again. Rent it first!"
2,"All hype, no movie","I anxiously awaited seeing ""Traffic"" for this first time. I must say that it was a dissapointment. I keep waiting for the movie to pick up, but It never did. No climax or conclusion in the film what-so-ever. It drags along at the same pace, then bang, it's already over. I don't see why Benico Del toro was praised so much by critics for this movie. He must have only said 5 words of english in the whole thing. This film will sadly make you feel no emotional at all for any of the characters, though probably does accurately tell the drug problem in AMerica"
2,Not really worth the hype.,"Yes-the acting was superb. Yes-it carried good messages-the war against drugs is hopeless, and if you get hooked on drugs your life is close to hopeless. It was too much of a documentary, though. There wasn't anyone likeable in this movie, either. It came across to me as boring and depressing. I wasn't riveted. It had it's good points, but the hype surprises me. I wonder if it's one of those movies everyone claims to like because everyone else claims to like it and if you say you don't like it, you are considered a fool."
5,"AN Acclaimed movie, and rightfully so","I'm embarassed to admit that the first time I saw Traffic I wasn't all that impressed. However, the film stuck with me and when it came out on dvd I bought it, watched it again and was hooked. This is a great film. The way the stories are woven together are superb. However, I do think the weakest part of this film was Michael Douglas's daughter doing drugs. Oh well. Make no mistake, this movie is an epic, and the cinematography terriffic. I love the way Mexico was shot. And the acting includes one of the best ensemble casts in recent years. Don Cheadle, and Benicio Del Toro are at the top of their game, as is Catherine Zata-Jones. Look for Benjamin Bratt in a cameo role."
1,Why did i rent this ?,"I am so glad I rented this move instead of just buying it.I felt like I was reading a book, not watching an award winning movie.The coloring of yellows and blues through out the movie were an eye annoyance.The characters were unreal and showed no or little emotion for something as large as drug trafficking and teen / family usage.I think the movie had a good plot idea but needless to say was played out very poorly.I had to struggle to stay awake and I kept telling my self it would get better ... but never did."
1,"Very over-hyped effort, but good acting.","First things first: The acting is pretty good, even when it is unintentionally humorous. However, I've got to wonder what kind of person thinks that this film makes anything other than the most simplistic statments about drug traffic or national drug policies. What was Soderbergh thinking? The characters are all charicatures from the liberal mindset. The viewer has no opportunity to empathize with any of the characters...the victories are hollow and the tragedies are meaningless. See a good production of ""Hamlet"" if you want to experience internal conflict and true tragedy. This movie is like something Dan Rather would put together. But, Del Toro IS quite good...."
1,overhyped,"I was expecting a masterpiece with all hype about Traffic. When I rented the DVD I realized I can't truse the general public. The whole plot taking place in America was very missleading and innacurate. What was depicted is not a good representation of American youths who are involved in the drug scene. It's on the borderline of a modern day Reefer Madness. I felt like I was watching a long, badly edited evening news. I would have been much happier just watching the Mexico plotline."
3,A great movie gets a less then great DVD,Traffic was awesome. Its just ashame that the DVD was less then average. With very little special features and average sound i would hold out untill they release a special edition.
3,Not worth the money,"This movie was shot in a way to intentionally to appear grainy in a lot of frames. Now the irony is obvious, what is the point to have a HD version of this movie? I loved the movie. Since I don't own the SD version, it's just a really pricy movie in my collection. Catherine Zeta Jones looked stunning in a few frames, but I am not sure if she would look any differene in 480p. It's a great movie, but you probably can buy it for a 1/4 of the price in regular DVD and you probably won't be able to tell the difference."
2,Style over substance,"It's the same arrogance that led to a plethora of dull, uninspired, pretentious 12 minute 'concept' songs in the 1970s that is behind this style of film.Traffic has everything: a good cast, an engaging plot, an exciting scenario and a message - so it takes a special kind of skill to ruin it in the way that it has been. A skill that is prominent in art-school classes populated by 20-something know-it-all, upper-middle-class talentless fools who seem to believe that the secret of good film-making is a sepia-coloured filter over the lens, and multiplying the run-time by 2.In short, a great idea badly made."
1,Just like sitting in Traffic,"Unfortunately I went to see this film in the theatre. It had potential but halfway through the movie we are to believe that Zeta Jones turns from naive house wife into a street smart, tough negotiator with a drug cartel. Come on! The acting was good but it never kept my attention. I guess it was suppose to show how drugs affect everyone in our society. The message was delivered but boring none the less."
3,This is a very good film but the British Series was,"infinitely superior. For the most part the series was better acted and the charactizations were more sharply defined and developed. The motivation was presented with greater logic and the locales were more interesting. Having said that, however, I still enjoyed the film under discussion and would actually rate it at 3 1/2 stars. Zeta-Jones' sudden transformation from ordinary housewife to tough, manipulative avenger was just too unbelievable. That's one of the examples of""motivation"" that I meant earlier. Still, a decent effort."
1,waste of time and money,the only sense that could be made of this movie was it is about drugs ten minutes into the movie you need some to sit through this film
4,Learn Details first,"As many may know it is important to learn information before purchasing, and even more so to do as much when speaking in a public forum. I would agree that this phone is limited compared to the p910, but it is overall a great phone. The bluetooth connectivity is easy to sync with. Luckily the internal memory is 32mb and the memory slot actually accepts up to a 128 memory stick duo. It only won't accept higher because it does not accept memory stick duo pros which are higher capacity."
3,Good phone with a design flaw and terrible customer service,"I have been using this phone for over a year now.THE GOOD:-- Good features with very intuitive user interface.-- Jog dial is very handy.THE BAD:-- Computer connectivity via bluetooth has bugs, so does direct USB connection.-- Backup and restore feature has some bugs.-- Sony Bluetooth devices have problems maintaining continuous connectivity with P900 sometimes.THE UGLY:-- The plastic on either sides of the display(screen) cracks and breaks off even with extremly careful usage and despite using SONY premuim leather phone case.-- Customer service sucks. They wanted $200 to replace the plastic around the display for such a, ""physical damage"".BOTTOM LINE: Though I am a SONY fan, I'd advise against investing in the P900."
2,Not impressed,"When it starts, there is a water stream inside that makes fish floating like mad in circles - nothing similar to the real life. The light is on and there is a sound (some may call it unpleasant but it would be more fair to say ""bearly noticable like a dentist's machine 3 doors away"":)). On a positive side, it works."
4,Love it,Everyone was right bout the smell but it don't stink and did have to cut the tube a little bit. It's big but not huge like everyone else is saying it feels really good and real they must be used to small ones who knows. I also bought dragon lube with it I got it off of bad dragon web site we just added a little extra water to make it squirt farther me and me husband love it it works great. If they made it to squirt a little more and made the tube a little better I would be rating this a 10 all the way :-)
2,eh ok,"this toy was funlike for one use , then i cleaned it and the hose part started to fall out the dildo still feels good but i have to take the squirter hose off so it its not as fun anymore only sed it 2 times before it broke"
3,Not Realistic,"I am sure that this item would would out real well with someone who has been indoctrinated to the ""larger"" things in life. Other than that I'm sure it's a great toy. I did send it back and was given credit by Amazon...A GREAT COMPANY!!"
1,WOW SMELLED SO BADDDD!,Ok well I am SERIOUSLY bummed about this product first of it comes in a mailing box i open the box and its in A BAG!!!! a red satin bag (you'd think it would come in a box) I open the bag and take off the plastic and I ALMOST DIED it smelt SOOOOOOO RANK WTF did you do to make this?!!!!! Ok so i gave him a bath and he's a LITTLE better then he was.. next thing is it came with NO DIRECTIONS!!! i spent hrs trying to get the damn thing to go into the tube you think they'd make it a bit easier. Ok well THANK GOD I DIDNT BUY THIS BECAUSE THIS THING IS CRAP AS OF RIGHT NOW. maybe in a couple of days the STINK will go away. I should leave it outside.
2,NO thank you,"I admit it is very nice size and I do enjoy the realness of it. The pump however doesn't work on mine, :( I am thinking I got one that was messed up, I have tried and tried and nothing goes through it. Still fun just doesn't squirt for me :("
2,STINKS!!,ok i mean it does work and everything and its a great visual aid because of how real it looks but it smells so bad! it irritates my nose even when its accross the room from me. im really considering throwing it away
4,"Very thick, and yes ""stinky"" ....","But, it's very realistic. The head is a little overly pink, but the rest looks TOTALLY real.. I like the feel to it also. But for me to use, it is quite difficult...Let's just say it's a little thick...I compared it to one of my others and was like WOW..same length, just makes the other one look tiny..Anyways, my only real complaints would be that the tube is way to hard to put onto the ""squirting"" piece..and the tube tends to poke out of the head..which is very uncomfortable...so suggest cutting it,etc. Overall, it nice...I like it, just a couple things that I would change.OHH and the smell...it's not stinky like, EWW..The smell is very strong, but not a gross smell...it's just too much..But like the other review said..let it air out."
4,A Tight Fit,"It does look and feel very realistic. It is also very, very huge. Then again, I'm a really small girl. Once you adjust, though it feels amazing. Definitely have to trim back the tube in the inside. I read some reviews where people said they had difficulty with the squirter, but I didn't have any trouble at all. You just have to slow down and be patient long enough to wriggle it into the other tube. Overall: I am very pleased with this."
4,One does not learn the tantric path with a book!,"That said, this is a good book on tantra. A customer warns against some possibilites to be led astray, but I can only say this -- if one reads BOOKS on kabbalah without the insight of a teacher one can also be led astray, or books on any of the hgiher level mystic teachings. All the dzogchen paths require a teacher, and tantra is a serious practice that is not about sex but about working with desires. Anyone stepping onto a path that works with one's shadow material should get the best teachers, with long lineage, and not go to weekend workshops or rely on books for their teachers. Harish Johari is an excellent artist and teacher."
5,Wonderful,"I experienced a kundalini awakening without the preparatory exercises aside from mantra, japa, and dhyana daily, focusing on Ma Kali's image. My spiritual mentor visited me after traveling to India and gave me a murti, copper yantra, and many pictures of Kali. That night I experienced the blissful union of Siva-Sakti. I believe kundalini can arise spontaneously with minimal cultural trappings... but if you want cultural trappings, the book is one of the best. I had a jyotish birth chart done for me with the use of Harish Johari's book on astrology and the correspondences were astoundingly accurate."
5,nice summary,The drawings alone are worth the purchase.....great overview of tantra for beginners such as myself....and contains much information without an overwhelming aspect
5,Nice book for women or man,"This book has a nice cover that works for men or women. In today's electronic society, it's nice to actually write on something that's not going to need upgrading in two years. Then in 100 years when your grandchildren want to learn about your life they need only open a book, not look for the computer program that you wrote it on way back when. I buy one almost every time I place an order at Amazon.com, at $5.99 per book why not?"
3,Elevating average,"Blockhead makes decent hip-hop inflected instrumental beats which are a tad more creative than your standard productions, but do not rise to the level of production interest inherent in say a Prefuse 73. Many of the tracks simply work best in their pleasant head-bobbing background context, though a few tracks make apparent Blockhead's abilities to issue more engaging work."
5,Good Music to Paint By,"My Art Instructor suggested this CD on his website, so I bought it. Sounds great to paint by."
1,Garbage...,"This album is garbage... I bought this CD solely on the basis of Blockheads production on Aesop Rocks Labour Days (one of the finest albums in my collection)Expecting similairly layered, emotion evoking sounds, I was bloody disappointed. Apart from ""Insomniac Olympics"" which makes me want to laugh and cry at the same time, the rest of this album is plain dodgy.Boom-bip beats and crappy samples really ruin this album. In a word - ""contrived"""
1,Mandolin Licks?,"The book/CD of 101 Red Hot Bluegrass Mandolin Licks and Solos was a real disappointment. Not only are the licks not complete, just short snipits but they are computer generated. The accompaniment is also computer generated. It isn't Bluegrass and doesn't sound like Bluegrass. Don't waste your money. This isn't a product you want. This will NOT help you! If you have anready wasted your mony, the best thing you can do with it is buried it in your backyard. This is an insult to mandolin players and to Bluegrass."
3,Disappointingly Tepid,"I agree with the other review (my version originally published in 2002) maybe a new version/release will take the shortcomings in the next revision.A Brilliant idea and long overdue but is realised very poorly. The 56 (2 bar Melody licks) nor the 16 (4 bar) nor 12 (8 bar) nor 12 (endings) are in any way special or different from normal. Only when we get to the five Cross Picking are there any memorable (4) licks.Suggestions for the next version, get transcripts of special ornamental licks as others have suggested, transpose suitable lovely fiddle, banjo and some guitar licks, to the mandolin and finally increase the selection of the cross picking licks from the meager 5.In all a brilliant idea, much needed and would be greatly appreciated but poorly executed."
1,Don't waste your money on..,"This course. The examples aren't really ""licks"" as such to begin with. They are basicly little snippets of melody out of fiddle tunes. Maybe not specific tunes but you get my drift. They are just short lines of melody, not what I would call licks. This is designed for beginners which is fine but the beginners would do much better elsewhere. They would better off to get a book of easy transcriptions of fiddle tunes of which there are many and go with it. You might as well get and learn the complete tunes rather than the little passages this course offers!"
2,Some funny dialogue and some good action save this book.,I was dissapointed by the lack of realism and and the confusing plot line. Jack Foley was a little to much of a nice guy for a guy who was probably someone's Bit?h. The movie was better. Read the book only if your a hard-core Leonard fan.
2,Fails to deliver,"I don't know how Out of Sight made the New York Times bestseller list when it came out. This book could have been written by a high schooler. The plot is nothing to write home about and Elmore's writing style is sub-par. The book lacks suspense. I knew (and you will, too) exactly how the book was going to end about 10 pages into it. The book is also lacking in emotion and description. It reads like this: Foly said, ""..."" She said, ""..."" He said, ""..."" The she said, ""..."" Get the idea? The book is a very easy read that could maybe entertain you for the weekend, but don't expect to be wowed by ""the best crime novelist of our time""."
2,No wonder so many of Leonard's books are made into movies...,"This isn't a novel it's a screenplay: dialogue, some location shots, minimal character development. I couldn't finish this book, it was too painful. My first Leonard book and my last."
2,WASTE OF TIME---,"This was one of those books that fizzled out causing me to feel I wasted my time. By the end, I could not care less what happened to whom or why."
4,I'll be reading more Elmore,"Good one. Although this is the first book I've read by Leonard, I'll def be doing another! Great characters and development of place. Good pace and no bull. Slighlty quirky and fun."
4,"LEONARD'S NEWEST IS GOOD, BUT PROMISES MORE THAN CAN GIVE","LEONARD'S NEWEST ON PAPERBACK IS INTERESTING AND BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. JACK FOLEY AND KAREN SISCO AND BUDDY ARE 3 VERY INTERESTING CHARACTERS, WHILE SNOOPY COULD OF BEEN GREAT, BUT'S ONLY OKAY. ALTHOUGH THERE'S LOTS OF DULL SPACES IN IT AND IS ALSO DEFINETLY NOT LEONARD'S BEST, IT'S STILL GOOD AND SOMETIMES EVEN UNPUT- DOWNABLE. THE CASTING OF THE NEW MOVIE OF THE BOOK SOUNDS GOOD AND REASONABLE, BUT NOT GREAT."
1,Great disappointment.,"My mother read the book, and I finished it within 24 hours of when she did. I got a few laughs but felt no suspense, no intrigue at all. I knew what was going to happen before it happened. Thought it was predictable and boring"
2,A Disappointment,"I came to this book completely open minded having never seen the film, knowing nothing of the plot and having never read an Elmore Leonard book before. I was really disappointed. It was a nice enough story but i thought neither character was particularly likeable and it was SO FULL of cliches. Maybe i am missing the point. I guess if you like other Elmore Leonard stuff you might like this (i read Touch and didn't think much of that either) or maybe if you like the film..."
2,"Out of Sight, Out of Mind...","This book was poorly written. Its plot was somewhat implausible and the characters were anything but dynamic. It seemed more like a screenplay thinly disguised as a novel, as it possessed very little literary merit. I would not recommend this book to anyone who values his or her leisure time."
3,Not as good as the movie,"OK, I know one shouldn't really compare novels and the movies that are made from them. And if you do, you should probably read the book first.I saw the movie version of this book before I read it. The movie was more nuanced, had a better plot, and more fully realized characters. The book is good airplane reading, not too demanding. But I was a little disappointed."
5,"Out of Sight: A Slightly Different Style, But Very Well Done","Out of Sight is a new style for Leonard, it has a more romantic/sarcastic look at how things work, I enjoyed as much as any other Leonard and liked the slight change."
3,Pales to the movie,"I gotta say that the book pales to the movie. If you've seen the movie, stop there. Read other Elmore Leonard novels like Rum Punch or Riding the Rap or KillShot. This one takes the same formula which is take 3 chapters, introduce the main sets of characters in the first two, and the conflict in the third, and let them wait it out with cultural references, odd dialogue, and comedic situations, and end it all in the end. The problem is the film makes the formula fresh by adding a great cast, nice camera work, nonlinear editing, a funky David Holmes score, and top-notch directing to tell the story. Here is it told from beginning to end and just seems rather bland and boring after seeing the film. And changing the races for alot of the characters (3 I'm thinking of right now) for the movie made it seem alot better. There is some latent racism in some Elmore Leonard books."
2,From the Leonard Reviews: Can't escape the cliches,"""Out of Sight"" starts so strongly--with the escape of legendary con Jack Foley from prison and his whimsical ""kidnapping"" of federal marshal Karen Cisco--that it's a shame that it runs out of steam so quickly. While Foley is a charming old-world criminal, and Cisco one of Leonard's strongest female characters--a complex mix of Rambo and Daddy's girl--that it's a shame how Leonard manufactures a series of threadbare plot devices to bring them together: stakeouts and near-misses; minor characters who fill up pages but amount to nothing; lots of south Florida ""atmosphere."" It's almost a textbook example of the Master running on autopilot--or on auto-Hollywood. Yes, it's worth reading, as almost all decent Leonard books are, but certainly not worth owning."
4,A good read that is still true to the Elmore style.,"I am an Elmore Leonard fan. I love is books.I read this book in a week or so. The characters are great and the dialogue is crisp and clear. The main focus of the book is jack/karen's love interest's in eachother. Elomore weaves this with the florida punch and the detroit cold as backrounds. The story maybe a little bit lacking sometimes it makes up for it with wit and charm. The sub characters are great like snoopy,her dad,buddy,glenn. I also did not like how the story turned out but other then that Elmore has made a great novel. It's also being made into a movie starring george clooney as jack and Jenifer lopez as Karen!!!!"
4,Out of Sight is OK...,"I love Elmore Leonard's books, but this time around, I wasn't too excited after reading his latest read. The characters, as always, were great and was the dialogue (as always). But I felt at times he got too lazy and I found myself ""waiting"" for some action--something to happen. The closing scene in the Detroit 'burbs I liked, but was a little disappointed how he ended things with Karen and Jack. Renee Russo would make a good Karen Sisco for the film...we'll see"
4,not as good as the movie,Out of sight is a pretty good book but is not as great as the movie which is strange because typically the other way around. The book still is a great crime novel that would please any fan of elmore leonard.
3,Its not what its cooked up to be !,"It says its a data cable with ""charging"" not sure what that means.But it does not charge my phone, thats for sure!This package does not come with any ""software""so that must be purchased separately.You can't do anything right after installing the driver cd.There are no instructions with package so you must feel your way through it.My advise is ""know what your buying"" so there won't be surprises in the end."
2,problems with this product,"We have owned this machine for less than six months...recently started having funny problems. The machine shuts off automatically while watching TV after 5-10 seconds. It completely rejects our VHS tapes and shuts off after 5 seconds when we attempt to play them. Unplugging the unit will occasionally correct the problem with the TV signal, but not with the VHS tapes.Otherwise, we really like the unit. But these problems make it nearly useless to us...can't watch TV or play VHS tapes or DVDs."
2,HARD DRIVE TROUBLE,"I too had owned this very Sylvania model. Until the hard drive took a dive. Which I was told are not replaceable. With computers,at least, you can replace the crashed hard drives. But with these new ATSC Digital tuner Vcr/Dvd combos. When the hard drive quits. Time to trash them."
3,Sina-whaty?,"I guess if you've already had some training in Kali/escrima and sinawali the book is okay, but it lacks in depth and is therefore not for the beginner. Also, there is a bit too much text on the author's school and his grandmasters and all that, but it's not too bad. This is more of an enhancer to one's training than a how-to."
5,A very helpful and understandable guide,"I have had the privilege of being one of Master Rey Galang's students for over a year now. We cover many different forms and styles, and sometimes it's hard to remember the exact techniques after class has ended. This book has been very helpful in perfecting my form, and reinforcing my knowledge while training on my own. It clearly demonstrates the techniques that make up this advanced form, and although I do not recommend it for beginners as one cannot truly understand sinawali without being taught in person, it is a very good aid for those familiar with Filipino Martial Arts and who are interested in seeing some of the things we do at Bakbakan."
3,Not as for beginners good as others.....,.This book isn't as good for beginners asModern Arnis: The Filipino Art of Stick Fighting
2,Complete Sinawali: Filipino Double Weapon Fighting (Complete Series),Picture quality is poor. I am a JKD practitioner and am trying to incorporate some of these techniques. But this will not help a beginner or an intermediate level martial artist. Also there is lack of counter moves. Some are shown but poorly illustrated.
3,An Irish Coming-of-Age Story,"This 1966 novel by Belfast-born Moore (best known for ""Black Robe"" and ""The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne"" is a touching and affecting --- and very, very Irish --- story of an 18-year-old boy in World War II Belfast who is trying to figure out where he fits in. He isn't good at academics (unlike his father and brother), his girlfriend is a strict Catholic who won't let him get past first base, and he's only sure of what he doesn't believe.He drops out of school and takes a low-paying job with the First Aid Patrol, a civil-defense outfit that few people take seriously, since it is widely believed that Hitler wouldn't bother bombing Ireland, and certainly not Belfast. Many older Irishmen hope that Hitler will defeat the British.This novel rambles somewhat but does have a convincing and satisfying conclusion, and the writing has several passages of considerable brilliance. A fast - paced, easy read, with realistic characters in a well-described milieu."
4,Capable enough to get you through high tide...,"Most of my friends often recommend the Lonely Planet books, especially for those of us who can't mortgage our homes for one-night stays in hotels listed by Frommer's and Fodor's guides. But I went with Rough Guide for my trip last summer to Greece, and while some of the maps weren't as detailed as they could might have been, most of the recommendations were spot on.Many nightspots get renovated; names get changed, etc. That's something the editors can't really help with. But any restaurant or bar I went to (listed in the guide) was above-average, if not better than they claimed.The historical data was also well-balanced; so you're not bored to tears with it, and yet it's detailed enough to keep you reading through it. Bonus marks for the great inclusion of the Greek music coverage (flawed, but excellent), and the price of the book is decent."
4,Great for backyard fun,"My 3 year old just loves this. He is a climber and we often visit playgrounds so he can climb and slide all he wants, but this is perfect for the backyard. He can go play and get some energy out without us having to leave the house, which is hard with 2 little ones. I thought he might get bored with it since it's smaller than the climbers at the playgrounds, but he will play on it for long periods of time. There are three ways to climb up, plus the slide so he goes up and down over and over and over. It does get hot in the sun though, beware!"
3,suprised,"We bought this one for my daughter for a therapy toy to help here with climbing. She is a tiny 21 months she loves the blue climbing part but is scared to stand once she gets to the top and scoots around on the platform, which scares me cause there is nothing on the side to stop herfrom falling off! The big problem I just discovered was the platform gets VERY HOT in the middle of the afternoon at only about 82 degrees outside, she climbed on it and started screaming cause it was so hot! Although the play area under the platform has been a thrill for my kids all 4 of them fit in comfy! But I think we are trading it in for something else!"
5,Great play and exercise climber!,"I agree with everyone, this was simple to put together - I did it myself with my 2 year olds help - if you call it help :) - and it still only took my around an hour. She coudn't wait to play on it, and though we've only had it a week, she still loves it. I like that it has the options of changing the mountian climber and the slide to a higher/harder level to offer her more of a challenge as she gets older. The nice man at the store took the parts out and they all fit in the back of my (new and smaller than the old one) Odyssey, even with the two center row seats in with the kids in them! And he got my double stroller on top of it! If in the future she plays with it a quarter as much as she does now it will be a wonderful investment."
5,A must for any adventurer,"My son just discovered slides a few weeks ago and feel in love. It then became my quest to find one for him to play with at home. So off the computer I go to find something that would be durable enough to handle my son's abuse. After a few days of looking around and reading countless remarks I decided on the ""Endless Adventure....."" I was able to assemble it in about 40 minutes by myself. I would recommend getting a little help. Some of the steps would have been much easier if I would have waited for my wife to get home.I don't know if all Toys R Us stock this item but I took the advice of one of the other reports and saved myself the $100+ and picked it up at the store. The box was huge, but after taking it out of the box it fit great in the back of my mid size SUV.My 22 month old son loves it and I don't cringe when he jumps on it."
3,"Okay, but....","This was okay, but take a look at Aloud: Voices from the Nuyorican Poets' Cafe. I read that book a few years ago, and still hold it one of my favorite books. I was hoping that this would be more of the same, but not quite."
2,The kind of album that Rush detractors feed upon....,"This is a horrible album by RUSH. Don't be fooled by the reviews below, it seems every Rush fan considers himself an ""authentic"" one and considers every accord the band plays to be the ultimate masterpiece in music ! But that's not true ! HEMISPHERES is ludicrous, recorded when Geddy Lee still couldn't sing, but just scream. And about the lyrics....what a joke ! Of course I recognize the merit of writing ""rock operas"", full of time changes and breaks, but come one !! IN HEMISPHERES this sounds wrong and funnyless. Only THE TREES is worthwhile. Skip it. Stick to PERMANENT WAVES, FAREWELL TO KINGS or MOVING PICTURES."
1,REAlly dislike it,"I only consider Rush to be a great band after the PERMANENT WAVES album. Before that, the band had th awful albuns FLY BY NIGHT, CARESS of STEEL and, amidst others, this HEMISPHERS, that will add absolutely nothing to your collection, only a bunch of screams by Geddy Lee and an horrible guitar tonality by Alex Lifeson, besides the silly lyrics by Peart."
5,Rush at the beginning of their absolute peak,"Hemispheres is probably the most progressive album in Rush's catalog, but it's also quite possibly their most concise, deftly exectuted effort yet. Rush were extraordinarily tight at this point in their career from their experience as a band. The 18 minute title track is a mammoth, and their last side long epic. Circumstances and The Trees are signs of what Rush would become in the coming years. La Villa Strangiato is a legendary instrumental that has gained the status of Rush classic due to it's neverending display of the individual band members' talents. The extraordinarily odd time signatures, Alex Lifeson's guitar heroics, Geddy Lee's bass expertise, and Neil Peart's legendary drumming make this quite possibly the strongest Rush effort so far."
5,Amazing as Always,"Reading the Editorial Reviews from Amazon's Steve Gdula I once again must say that idiot does not get it. Rush is a Singular combination of Musical Skill, Incredible collaboration and Creative Genius. The Rhythmic Backbone of Geddy and Neil make this one of the best albums ever recorded. The band covers the Frequency Spectrum with Alex taking the Higher registers Neil and Geddy sharing a back and forth on the lower registers. This is a classic CD that belongs in every Hard rock enthusiasts Collection."
3,Rush Hemispheres SHM CD. SHM version sounds same as U.S. remaster.,Rush Hemispheres SHM CD is great as far as it being a mini replica of the album cover and artwork from the original LP copied to make this a mini LP replica CD. As far this SHM (Super High Material) CD making the music sound better I compared it to the U.S. Rush Hemispheres Remasters version and it sounds exactly the same. Otherwise the packging is great. Even the CD itself has artwork on it that the original LP record label had on it. But it sounds the same. The hype of it being a SHM CD offers no difference in sound quality here.
3,Not Bad.,"This is one of the albums of Rush that I have barely listened to. No doubt the music is played well, I just have never been able to immerse myself in this album. Besides ""The Trees,"" I don't care for the rest of the album--just not my taste. Not a bad album though."
5,"Geddy, Alex. Neil, Oh My!!!!!!!","I originally bought this on cassette in a cut out bin at K-Mart in the early 80s (I started to like Rush w/ Moving Pictures as most did). When I first heard this I was truly amazed. This is an all time classic progressive release. Anything that they do should be judged by this standard. And I'm sorry but Test for Echo, Counterparts and the like are way below standards. A must for all serious collections."
4,A must-have for Moms new to breastfeeding!,"This book is well written, filled with educated information and very encouraging in today's soceity of formula pushers. I chose this book specifically because I'd never seen anyone breastfeed a baby before and found the many pictures very useful in positioning my son correctly. My son is now 13 months old and I still refer back to it for new ideas as he grows into a toddler and a more active nurser. Highly recommended!!"
3,Worth the money,Cheap but does the trick. Holds our small passive dog in the back. Adjustments are hard to tighten and some work on friction only. It seems like you can modify it to be stronger. Over all I'm glad I didn't spend more on a nicer one
3,Works Well,"You get what you pay for....this is an inexpensive solution and it does work well. Like anything that is made one size fits all, it works but doesn't fit perfectly. We have a 2010 Honda CRV and the when the supports are installed against the roof the push in on the material. They haven't left a mark yet, but most certainly will after a couple of years.All that said I would buy this again because of its price point and it keeps our labrador in the back of the car."
3,Doesn't keep my dog from climbing into the backseat,"We have a Newfoundland puppy who doesn't sit still during car rides. I purchased this to keep him in the back of my Jeep for safety. He is so strong that he simply pushes on the bars (which slide) and squeezes right through into the backseat. I haven't found a way to keep the bars from being adjustable...I guess that is the ""universal"" feature."
2,Disappointing,"Solid construction, BUT adjustable side rails just slide in and out like a trumpet. Your dog will figure this out quickly and just squeeze himself through with little effort. The company should make them to baable to lock in place."
3,Highland Pet Barrier,"This product works for me, but not without adjustments. I have a rather calm large dog, but he was able to push the entire unit backwards or forwards in my van. He could also push the trombone-like bars in and push past. I had to buy chains and fit them around the upright bars and attach them to the seats to secure the unit. Next I had to buy these clamps and tighten them on the trombone-like bars so they would no longer move in. If your dog is small and doesn't challenge a thing, this product would probably need no adjustment."
4,Ok,"Works perfect with my dog, but this is because he doesn't push it. I guess that if your dog tries hard enough, he'll take it down."
2,"Sturdy, but doesn't stay in place","This barrier does go in easily... but like other reviewers, I found that the wing bolts that tighten the vertical 'feet' in place loosen themselves with car vibration and the barrier falls on your dog's head when you turn a corner... OR my 80 lb. German Sheppard leans back against one of the feet and it slides and BOOM on the dog's head. Then despite my best efforts to tighten the screws on the cross bars, I have had these slide as well. Would have taken only a little extra thought on the manufacturer's part to fix these problems as it is an otherwise nice design. I use it, but have to check EVERY time I get in the car that it is still tightly in place. This is annoying."
2,You get what you pay for,"We read all the previous reviews and figured that this wouldn't be the highest quality pet barrier, but hoped it would be sufficient to keep our 3 month old puppy in the back of our Subaru. Installation wasn't a problem, took about 15 minutes. But within 5 minutes our puppy quickly figured out that there is no clamp on the horizontal bars. He easily slid it to the side and climbed up front. We fixed the problem with some hose clamps and rubber tubing from Home Depot (an extra $10 plus the trip to the store). It isn't perfect, but it works for the pup. If we had a bigger dog, I do not think it would take much effort for him to pull this away. It's reasonably secure, but a simple tug would probably move it enough to get thru.Bottom line...it isn't bad, but don't expect perfection. At the minimum, be prepared to do something to hold the horizontal bars in place. And be careful, if the slide quickly enough it could crack your window."
2,Highland 20045 universal pet barrier,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002MABGE/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThe Highland 20045 pet barrier for a car is not very secure, it is hard to tighten it so it sits secured in one place; it has a tendency to fall out of place by itself, can injure a pet."
3,Flimsy But Does the Job,"I was not very impressed with this item, but it's enough of a mental barrier to keep our Saint Bernard in the back of the car where she belongs during normal circumstances. I wouldn't recommend this product if you have a very aggressive or excitable dog."
2,Didn't Work For Me,Easy enough to install with some adjustment but my 24 pound dog wiggled through in 30 seconds which defeats the purpose entirely.
1,will give you a headache,"easy to install, but will not give an exact fit in the sense that if you own one ore more larger dogs it will easily fall, drove arround with the thing for a week and decided to throw it away because of the permanent ratteling noise that it makes.helena danielsson"
3,"Low cost solution to controlling dogs in car, but with limitations","The product itself works fine when it is newly tightened. By that I mean that you have to keep tightening it every week or so, as the regular car vibrations seem to make it slacken and rattle. Over time, with medium or large dogs involved, it begins to cave in to the pushing and shoving. However, regular tightening seems to work fine. On a long trip with the dogs, plan on doing a tightening routine after a few hours if you want it to stay up."
3,Dog barrier,"I really like it as long as I remember to adjust it, since it seems to vibrate loose every other weeks or so."
3,Highland pet barrier,"This pet barrier is functional, but not fully universal, or 100% escape proof. I installed it in a 2006 chevy trailblazer and due to the fact that the top pads do not adjust to the countour of the vehicle, I had to move the vertical poles in more, causing instability. Also, the side slide extensions do not lock and the dog could move them over and get through. I had to secure them with tape to make them more escape proof."
5,Great product,"I ordered this through a local auto store. Easy to set up- takes about 20 min. The directions are a bit ""rough"" (not the best English) but there are pictures to help you along. After installed it works great. Can't beat it for the price!"
3,Works with some flaws,"This barrier works to keep my dogs in the cargo area and off the baby in the back seat, which is why I got it. But, the vertical rods are tensioned with wing nuts that continually loosen and cause the thing to rattle. It drives me nuts, and I have to tighten it every few days. Also, the feet that sit against the ceiling and floor of the car are rather rigid and will likely cause permanent indentations in the header fabric due to the pressure that must be maintained to keep it upright. And although Amazon told me it would fit in my vehicle, it doesn't, quite. There is a rise in the ceiling just at the spot where the barrier needs to sit and so I lose a little cargo room because I have to move it back so it sits flush with the ceiling."
2,Break Out the Tape!!!,"After reading scores of mixed reviews, I figured I would take a chance on this barrier. While it will work for me and my mellow dogs, it still needed some slight modifications. NO, you don't have to be a handyman.....if you're good with tape then you'll be OK! As many others have mentioned, the provided screws don't tighten the cross bars onto the main beam. I cranked them as tight as I could get them without any effect. They did not tighten at all and the cross bars still moved up and down at will. Additionally the extensions on these same cross bars are very loose, and have no mechanism, operational or otherwise, to secure them. To say that they're loose would be an understatement.In both cases I pulled out the 100 MPH tape (a military type similar to duct tape) and locked everything down. Like I mentioned, it will work for me because my dogs are older and mellow. However, if you own a hyperactive pup, DO NOT GET THIS BARRIER as the design is shoddy at best!"
3,Ok for the money,"This is not a terribly expensive product and for the price, it works ok. It easily fit my Jeep Cherokee--no need for the extensions which was nice. However, it required modifications for it to stay in place. The screws which are supposed to hold the cross pieces in place do not tighten enough and my dog was able to push between the cross pieces and slide them apart! My husband used clamps to secure the cross pieces and they now work fine. The device could use some spring tension to tighten it between floor and ceiling as well because it can get knocked out of place (without even loosening). All that being said, if you are handy with a few tools, this barrier works well and is rather streamlined and unobtrusive."
2,Not that great,"Maybe it depends on the car, but I couldn't get it tight enough in my SUV to prevent the dogs from knocking it down. It also probably depends on the dog. If the dog really wants to get past it, they will. If you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a ""psychological barrier"", this would be ok. Oh, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, the ""trombone"" style sides slide easily back and forth, I had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place."
1,Poor Quality!,"Not only is this barrier a very poor fit for our Ford Expedition, but the hardware is awful. The height of our cargo area just happens to be too short for the extension and too tall to work without it. The screws are less than half an inch from the ends of the pipes causing it to be practically useless. It wobbles and falls on the dogs constantly, we finally had to wind a bungee cord around it and tie it to the headrests which doesn't seem the least bit safe, but at least it is a temporary fix. Even in a different vehicle I would think that the quality of this barrier would be sub par, all the dog has to do is bump near the base and it will tumble down."
2,Too small and too cheap,"Apparently my Land Rover has a taller trunk than most, as this doesn't even come close to fitting... almost a foot to go even when extended to full height!Also, the build of this is stupid. they could even save metal and make a more sturdy product.The only reason I don't give this one star is because i like the less cagey look and the price is somewhat less than the others. I'd suggest shopping walmart or something and find something better."
1,Terrible,I installed as the directions stated to do and proceeded to put my two 60 pound dogs in the back of my SUV. By the time I came over to sit in drivers seat they had broke through it! I followed some of the reviewers advice and purchased different screws to make barrier stronger...this time it took they about a few seconds more to break it down!!! I am going to get a refund-this is NOT for big dogs maybe it would hold back a Chihuahua !!
5,"Simple installation, works great",Quick installation and works great. No damage to vehicle. Large golden retriever about 70lbs is perfectly contained in the rear of our vehicle. I'd recommend it.
3,"it works, just don't buy used","As in the title, it works, but because I bought used it was missing a few screws and bolts. I jerry rigged it so that it works, and it is ok."
3,Made more for smaller dogs,The horizontal bars that adjust up/down need some rubber tape to keep them in place even if you tighten the screws alot. Good value for the money.
1,Unable to rate any lower,"This product was a huge waste of time and money. It is poorly designed, and my dogs walked right through it the first time we tried to use it. Big disappointment. I wish I could ask for a refund."
2,Cheap Pet Barrier,This is an inexpensive product. I should have bought something sturdier. It is flimsy and will not last very long. I regret the cheaper choice for this item.
3,"Might be good in other applications, but not ours","We bought this to use in our 2010 Jetta Sportwagen to keep our 60-pound Golden Retriever from jumping into the back seat. It works for this need but it is in constant need of adjustment. I am pretty handy with cars and tools and even I find it a pain to have to constantly adjust this barrier. Keep in mind our dog doesn't even test it - when it's in place he leaves it alone. The barrier slides out of position just from normal driving - at least in our car. It doesn't slide so much that the dog can get through, but it slides enough that you need to re-adjust it almost weekly in our case.In addition to get this to work in most cars, because of the slant of the rear seats you're almost certainly going to lose several inches of floor space to this bottom of this barrier.We're going to try a barrier that just goes up over the headrests next."
4,pet barrier,"This product has helped me out a lot. My dogs always jumped over the seat to get up front. It was nerve racking, now they stay in the back where they belong. It is easy and simple to install. I have to tighten it up about once a week but it is worth it. It makes my driving a lot less stressful. I highly recomend this product and the price is affordable."
1,"Arrived without parts, and in used condition","This transaction was AWFUL. The barrier took 2 1/2 weeks to arrive, and then was in used condition, and missing a part. I called the manufacturer, and their customer service was extremely rude to me, and said I will have to wait another 2 1/2 weeks for the part to ship - if it is in stock in their warehouse. If not, I have to wait until they get more manufactured. Shame on the maker of this, and shame on Amazon for working with such a terrible wholesaler. I would never recommend this product or manufacturer to anyone. Spend $10 more, so that you get a usable product within a reasonable time period."
3,Great but dog chews on this style,"The gate is great except that our dog chews on the metal bars. Not great for their teeth. I liked this style better than the more cage like style, but we'll be ordering the other kind to save our pups teeth."
1,Would love to rate the item but I never acutally recieved it,Loved the price but I never actually received the item. It shipped to the wrong address and I never got it back :-(
5,Excellent Bargain!!,I purchased this barrier to keep my slobbery Rottweiler from drooling all over the back seat of my brand new Kia Rondo--It was very simple to put together and does a great job keeping him in the back of the car. The best part was the price! Very economical! And it looks great too--sleek and stylish!
3,HIghland Pet Berrier,"This unit is described as a universal fit. There is nothing in the description giving the maximum height and width. It was NOT adjustable to reach a height of 50 inches(A 2006 Toyota Sienna ). I had to improvise an extension. Other than that, the installation was easy."
3,"OK, not great. Price is good. Quality sucks",Same problem as everyone else. The bars do not stay in place once tightened. I placed them where I wanted them and then wrapped black electrical tape around the bottom of the bars on the posts to keep them from sliding down. Great for the price but wasn't sure I had put it together right because it kept falling apart before I got it in the car. There are better ones out there that I would recommend if you are going to use this often. I will only use it once in awhile to take the dog on a trip or to the vet. I have a 2011 outback so I can tell you that it fits in there. Should fit in most vehicles. You just might have to make some manual adjustments to it.
1,piece of junk,This is a piece of junk. The directions do not match the parts. There are no screws to hold the poles in the brackets. I had to figure out that the rubber tubes are placed on the horizontal poles and the brackets go over the rubber. The vertical support poles do not fit into the brackets. The vertical poles are too large to fit into the brackets. I cannot get this together.
3,"Pretty crappy design, but basically works","This is not a well-designed product. The screw-clamping system is really crappy, so it's hard to get the bars to stay up, and awkward to tighten. The big round ""feet"" don't pivot, so they don't fit very well against my slightly curved roof. Putting a folded wash cloth between the feet and the roof was helpful. I would have returned it, except the more expensive ones look like they're exactly the same."
3,It's OK!,"I'm not thoroughly impressed but it does deter my dogs from wanting to job over the seat. Very flimsy construction. If the dogs leaned on it I'm sure it would just fall to pieces. Not break, just come apart. In this case you get what you pay for.Johnny G"
2,Not quality... Wouldn't recommend to others,The product is flimsy. It falls easily and it not sturdy. My dog is very calm and still is able to move the bars. I would recommend spending the extra money and purchasing a sturdy more secure barrier.
4,"Works great, easy install.","This barrier works well. I have a young German Shepherd that loves nothing more than to come over the seat and sit with my children. Unfortunately I cannot have her on the seat getting hair everywhere. This barrier works wonderfully and was easy to install. It doesn't seem overly sturdy, but has never failed and works fantastically."
1,horrible card,"Have tried several times to select the english option by pressing ""1"" on the automated menu so as to navigate towards making a phone call. It offers the option for english speaking customers. Will not allow you to select that option. If you are not a chinese speaker, that makes this card pretty much worthless. Maybe they should make that clear before one purchases the card."
3,It works but isn't perfect,"It keeps my dog in the back of my car (or it used to before I got a subaru outback equipped with a manufacturer dog barrier), but it hogs up some floor space in the process. However, it's virtually the only option you have for a quality barrier, and it does work, so I recommend it."
2,Not so good for me,My smaller dog (30 LB terrier mix) was able to move the horizontal bars in and get into the back seat and claw up the top of my seats in the process. If side bars locked might have worked better. I had to return it. I was trying to use in Hyundai Santa Fe
2,"Doesnt work for modern SUV , Nissan Rouge Fail","My puppy keeps knocking it down, and it does not tighten well due to the rounding in the ceiling of the car. Its just cheaply made, you get what you pay for,"
3,easy to install,Instructions were oddly worded so I basically had to 'figure it' Really wish it was spring loaded as the screws aren't very attactive. Just installed it today so I haven't used it with my dogs yet but I'm looking forward to trying it out. The price was right.
4,This pet barrier has solved my problem,"I recently got a dog who seemed calm, polite, and knows her territory. Wrong! She immediately learned to crawl over the seats to get to my stuffed animals on the dash. Well, not any more. It only took me 15 minutes to install the barrier and I've had no issues since. Granted my dog is calm and polite and between 60-70 pounds, so she hasn't tried to mussel her way through even with food left in the car. I feel this is well worth the money, and it only took a few days to arrive."
4,Works okay in a Volvo XC,"I share the others issues about the bars ability to move, but it is a simple fix to secure them and at half the price of comparable models, I think it is worth it. Seems to keep my precocious 1 yr Lab in the back (much to her dismay!)."
4,Highland Pet Barrier,Easy to assemble and simple to adjust. Utilizes heavy duty materials. I did put a 1/4 inch board in front of the barrier just incase my rottweiler gets the urge to chew up the back seat of my Honda wagon.
4,wiggles loose,"Like it, works, fits nice. However we seem to have to we screw everything about once every three months. Id buy it again though."
3,How determined is your dog?,The install was easy enough and the directions were good but my 80lb German Shepherd pulled on the bars until the whole thing pulled loose. I think it would work with a smaller less determined dog but if you have a bull headed dog then look elsewhere. We sent it back
4,Great purchase!,Best bang for your buck. This thing works really good. Don't understand the reviews saying it gets loose and falls down. They should try not being a girl and tighten the thing properly. I will buy another for my other vehicle. I do highly recommend this for dogs up to 70lbs like mine.
3,Tricky assembly but does the job,"I don't have this assembled correctly; I can't get tighten the crossbars enough to hold them in place. I'll spend more time with the directions but in the meantime, I can rest the crossbars on top of the base of the shade which pulls over to hide items in the back of my Forester. It's working for my two small dogs. It may not work for large, strong, determined dogs but for mine I'm happier with this than I would have been to spend $200 to get the Subaru-brand dog barrier permanently installed. I like that this can be removed so that I can still transport cargo throughout the length of the car."
4,Great pet barrier!,"This pet barrier works pretty well so far. It has started to fall a little bit a couple times, but I think that its just something that I could adjust more tightly. Looks nice, very adaptable to vehicles, and the dog doesn't drool all over my seats anymore. Great price."
4,Solid product,Seems to be a good product after several weeks of use. Barrier stays in place even while restraining two large dogs. My only complaint is that the bar extensions don't lock into place. My dog has already figured out how to slide the extension in and squeeze through.
3,Good product,"This barrier is a good product. We didn't have luck with it because we have a 75 pound pit bull with extreme separation anxiety. The barrier worked for the first trips, however the dog then figured out how to ""break"" through it. He never actually broke the barrier, he is just soo strong that he could push the pieces out of place and squeeze his fat head through a small space. We would return to the car with him in the passenger seat...."
1,Great if you have a yorkie,"This gate seemed like a great option for me based on affordability and reviews about how it fit in Jeep/Dodge models. Unfortunately, it has not worked at all for my family. I have a 60+lb dog who constantly pushes the bars around and is able to then easily get into the back seat. Even when he does not push all the way through it, he pushes it enough to loosen it and then it rattles loudly while I drive. With a newborn in the back seat, it is imperative for me to be able to keep my over-sized puppy in his own space. This gate was a big disappointment and I ended up having to purchase a more expensive one of better quality. It may seem like an affordable option, but you will waste money in the end."
2,Bent by my 90 lb lab.,"We have a large and hyperactive lab who is over 90 pounds. We wanted something to keep him from jumping into the back seat of our SUV because he was shedding so much.So, my husband installed this in our Mitsubishi Endeavor for our 90+ pound Labrador Retriever. It fit almost perfectly. He had a bit of a trouble to make it fit length and height-wise, but at the end it did fit.The barrier worked great the first time we used it. My dog didn't know what to do about it, so he stayed in the back. It was more like a mental barrier for my dog because he could have easily moved the horizontal bars since there's no lock to keep 'em in place.But then, after a few uses, my dog figured out a way to move the bars. And I don't know if was my super heavy dog or what, but one of the vertical bars bent, the horizontal bars fell down and everything was loose, we tried to tighten it up again but it was worthless, my dog kept jumping into the back seat.This would probably work for a smaller dog."
3,Not for excited puppies,"I really wanted to like this. I have a German shorthair puppy and he is full of energy. It took only about 3 miles for him to knock it over, and be up front with me. I had to hold him while driving the 3 miles back home. I think for a calm dog this might be ok."
1,Just hope your dog doesn't want to get up front,"Flimsy, no holders for the side hoops (yes they slide in and out freely with nothing to hold them out???). My boxer puppy made very quick work of this piece of trash. Save yourself some money and buy a better, more expensive one up front."
1,Piece of junk!,"As noted by other reviewers, the screws will not tighten far enough the prevent a mid-size dog from forcing its way through the bars. I tried improve the product by through bolting the bars so they would not slide. ""Not to worry"" said my 55lb. Lab mix, ""I'll just bust right through."" And she did. The side extensions are made of such ligh weight tubing, she was able to force her way right through, bending the bars apart.I would recommend you save yourself the time and trouble and just buy a mesh-type divider right off the bat. Don't be drawn in by the cheap price - you get what you pay for.... and some times you don't even get that much.Anyone know how to return a twisted up mess of metal to Amazon for a credit?"
5,Gorgeous book,Going through this book I'm amazed Connors/Buck were able to capture the most beautiful pictures of the Cuba I once left.As the tears flowed I knew I was home once again.Thanks for bringing this gift to us readers.
4,Cuban Elegance...,"Being of Cuban heritage, I was interested in finding a book dealing with the island's past and birth. If you like history, you will like this book. It is very well written, but I do wish it had more photos of architecture and the decorative arts of Cuba's past."
4,Tribute to Nature and Our Natures,"In their introduction, these two creative, artistic, imaginative writers link the four seasons to our inner world, which, ""also has a yin-yang journey."" The journey of the self, they explain, is always in a seasonal place: the greening spring, the flaming autumn, the dark winter, or the bright summer. For each season, they present poems; personal memories; antiphons and gospel prayers; guided meditations; and celebrations, rituals and prayer services. Their tribute to nature and the human spirit is heightened by the full-color page decorations and artwork of Mary Southard, a nationally known visual artist, educator, and ""student of the Earth."""
1,Wicca Watch!,"If you remain at all confused as to the nature of this book, simply try google-ing the names of the authors. We find here a trend in the Wiccan religious tradition being written by purportedly Catholic nuns. Here is a quote by Wiederkehr in one of her other books, ""God is Someone who has taken the time to sit on a quilt with me waiting for beauty. She is a Mother of Presence."" -- Yes, you heard right, God is a woman; does that make Jesus a woman too? It's all so confusing. Buyer beware! This isn't the placid book it claims to be about happy, let's-hold-hands-in-the-sunshine banal spirituality, it is a quiet indoctrination into Wicca."
3,It's alright,"My senior Honors English class read this book for a marking period in a mini ""book club"" type setting. The book overall was challenging, but rewarding. My group members and I were able to discuss the book together which made the reading less difficult, however there were still some parts of the book that we didn't comprehend. In order to get the most out of the story, the reader preferably should have good knowledge of the conflict between Kashmir and Pakistan. There are many plot lines throughout the book, which makes the book appealing to many people. The two main plot lines are the war with Kashmir as well as a love story. I would recommend this book to a reader who is up for a challenge, yet enjoys reading an eye opening novel about another culture."
1,I think he done said what he's gotta say,"I've read all of Rushdie's novels and only truly loved ""Midnight's Children"" and ""Shame"". ""Shalimar The Clown"" reads as though someone is trying to write like Salman Rushdie: it's strained, show-offy and kind of trite. It has an ""Entertainment Weekly"" tone. Sorry, I found ""MC"" to be, arguably the single most thrilling read of my adult life, but almost everything since then has been dissapointing.Sad, but I guess everything moves on."
1,Book is excellent... narration is terrible!,"Excellent book! Terrible narration by Mandvi. I cannot understand why he did not learn to pronounce the common Indian names in the book,... wasn't that the point of using an South Asian narrator?"
5,Awesome!,Sheer poetry in literature.. I was unfounded in assuming marriage would make a softie of Mr. Rushdie.
1,I Found It Unreadable.,"If you like books that are pedantic, boring, that attempt to erect too elaborate of a framework from which to hang a plot, then this is the novel for you. Maybe things got better after page sixty-five, that's all the farther I got. It's probably not ethical to base a review on a book I didn't finish, but Rushdie leaves me so annoyed every time I read him that I really wanted to say something here. Why on earth is this man regarded as one of humanity's greatest novelists?"
4,Excellent Read,"Rushdie's literary style is difficult at first. I think it is called magic realism. However, as you enter the world of Kashmir, it is an appropriate technique. As the book gathers steam (like a locomotive pulling out of the stattion)it becomes a much faster read and then the plots become compelling. I feel like I understand what has been lost in Kashmir in the past 50-60 year. Excellent. Will probably go back and look at some of his other works."
5,Extraordinary!,"StC is a surpassing novel, transcendent. Rushdie ranks among the finest novelists ever. Some writers should be read. Others must be read. If you truly love fiction, you must read this novel. Enough said."
4,Wicked.,Great book. The master weaves effortlessly forwards and backwards in time; into and out of places. The weaving never seems contrived. The book becomes a serious page-turner. But this book is very different in character from earlier books like Midnight's Children and The Moor's Last Sigh - the trademark juxtaposing of comedy and brutal darkness is different - more brutality with the lighter moments more like comic relief in the gloomy reality of the world Rushdie makes us see. In fact the books does have a depressing air about it. But the ending is very satisfying. And it is a wicked read.
5,excellent service,"I am very satisfied with the price, quality, and service! I will buy from this vendor again!"
3,John and Bert,"Anyone purchasing this, hoping to hear something akin to Pentangle..beware. It is not Pentangle. It probably is far from the guitar work these two brillant musicians were capable of making. It's not bad guitar work from either but does not rival most of their Pentangle recordings. I wanted to hear some songwriting and vocals from these two, whom I considered good at both, along with extraordinary guitar work. I expected too much. What they did in Pentangle appears to have been their best. I wish someone could inform me if either made anything noteworthy following Pentangle. I mean this cd is not john mclaughlin or al dimeola or even frank zappa. Yet when you listen to Pentangle you hear genius. Where did it go?"
5,Cleaning kit,Great kit for keeping trumpet clean. resealable bag is better than the old style box. It fits easily it your trumpet or gig bag. It's compact.
5,Teaches Forgiveness,"This is an excellent movie. Not only does it teach forgiveness, but it also teaches that a person can truly change from the inside out. Of course, it is only through the Lord Jesus Christ that we can make this positive change. Although the movie doesn't delve into religion, it is certainly a family friendly movie that opens the door for instruction regarding Godly values."
4,saving shiloh dvd,In good shape. No problems. Came in a short amount of time after order. Mrs Howard
3,"Too average for Rush, One song did it all","Ok. Not the artistic/powerful and deep-lyrics album we can expect from these monsters of rock. Not after two of the most important albums in prog/hard rock history: Permanent Waves, and Moving Pictures. Songs are too weak, so is the general musical performance of the trio (especially Lifeson who maybe was suffering from jet lag or something)...but, there is one song....one song alone that really makes this album worth having: MARATHON. Very, very few tracks have really impressed me in the 22+ years of listening to Prog/Hard Rock, and Marathon stands in the top ten. A superb performance, devastating lyrics, deep and extremely smart musical arrangement (not to mention those bridges and up tempo-changing jams), are just some of the assests of this masterpiece. I think that despite the average review, the album is not too bad, plus Marathon is just mandatory for someone who claims to be a Rush Fan. My real rating for PW is 3.5 stars."
2,sounds cheesy,"This is one of rush's worst albums at least in my opinion. Guitars are almost removed entirely and replaced by synthesizers which makes the songs end up like sounding like cheesy 80's pop. Aswell as with the exception of ""grand designs"" the lyrics of the songs incredibly weak;who wants to hear songs about dropping an atom bomb and running marathons. When the lryics go ""imagine a time"" it sounds like a childrens story. Stay away from this album and get some of Rush's earlier stuff."
1,Nadir,"Every group has it's bad moments. I can't stand this Rush recording.At this point, Geddy needed to pick up a bass guitar again and create, rather than allow computers to RE-Create programmed mush.Uugh!"
1,Awful!,"""Manhatten Project?"" C'mon guys, lighten up! Even though your music had always been serious, it still had a bit of lightheartedness to it, i.e ""Closer To The Heart.""Power Windows is a complete retreat from the Rush that made their classic albums, and I didn't like the keyboard dominated sound one bit when it was released. The music sounds like one big fat mush, with no redeeming hooks, solos, or melodies whatsoever. The group hasn't recovered from it, in my estimation, though ""Roll The Bones,"" and ""Counterparts"" aren't bad."
1,80's mayhem!,You can say Rush has done an excellent job in reinventing themselves in order to survive the times and ever revolving musical changes. Power Windows happens to arrive in a time when it sounded out of place and forced and ever since i haven't heard anything better from the power trio. I did grow up on Rush's music and i love their works but i wouldn't recommend this one.
4,For Rush Fans,"Well, I myself enjoy this CD very much. I'm sure most Rush fans do. It's got some great songs, like Marathon and Mystic Rhythms."
4,"Better than average, but not Rush's best","While I consider Rush to have been in decline since Moving Pictures, that is not to say they were not still a potent band after that album. This album lacks some of the boldness and complexity of some of their previous music, but it still stands above most other contemporary efforts in terms of mature, sophisiticated sound. To compare to cheesy 80s bands such as Flock of Seagulls is just plain silly. Yes, there are some synthesizers, but can't we be just a tad less superficial? This is not hard, progressive rock musical genius such as can be found on Moving Pictures. Still, there are pleasures to be found here, although it took 3 or 4 listens before I really started to groove on the subtle melodies and chord progressions. Only Big Money is a radio-style hit, but I assure you this is better than some of their later mush."
3,"A slicker, more spacious sound","Grace Under Pressure is Rush at its most electronic -- to some fans, it seemed like synthesizers were drowning out the rest of the instruments. The next two albums, while still keyboard-heavy, used them in a more spacious, orchestral fashion. Instead of sounding abrasive, the synths were absorbed into a slick arena-rock production. Power Windows is the first album in this style, with mixed results. Sometimes the music sounds too sterile or bombastic. There's some good material here (""The Big Money"", ""Territories"", ""Emotion Detector"", and the classic ""Mystic Rhythms"") balanced out by some forgettable stuff. A good album nonetheless."
4,"Terrific playing and Rush's ""New World Man"" view","In this 1985 album, Rush presents songs that reflect the concerns and issues of the time, such as greed on ""The Big Money"" and nuclear power on ""The Manhattan Project."" These aren't songs with the length or jams of Rush's early work, but they are strong, and the keyboard and especially, the rhythm section of Geddy Lee and Neil Peart is terrific."
3,"Can't hit a home run every time, I guess","Even mediocre Rush is better than 90% of popular music, but unless you're a musician and are interested in recording techniques or a drum clinic, save your money and bum ""Emotion Detector,"" ""Big Money"" and ""Marathon"" off your friends.The rest is strictly throwaway."
3,Not very Good.,"I know RUSH put out quite a few Records in the 80's.But this CD album sounds way to ...well...""80's"".At times I dont know if I am listening to Rush Duran Duran or Flock of Seaguls.THere are just way to many Keyboards/Guitar synths and wood blocks.The end of the song ""Mystic Rythams"" sounds all Cindy Lauper.Even the singals they released are prety week for RUSH songs...Take a pass on this one...Buy ""A Farewell to Kings"""
5,A Girl Shares Her Opinion,"I had never heard of RUSH until the ""The Big Money"" came on the radio one night in the fall of 1985. It immediately caught my attention. I remember thinking that the song sounded so... ""BIG""! Sorry, no pun intended. The sound was aggressive yet melodic and (it seemed to me) a little over the top. But I immediately decided that I liked it. It was like nothing I had ever heard before. Soon afterwards I learned that it was just three guys making all of that music! I was impressed. I purchased the album and loved it. I have since looked forward to all RUSH album releases. They are outstanding musicians."
2,Keyboard excess,"'Windows' continued the keyboard synth-rock sound of the mediocre 'Grace Under Pressure', and is a slight improvement on its predecessor. The production is smoother and more polished than 'Pressure', so the keyboard sound stands out even more. 'Middletown Dreams', 'Emotion Detector' and 'Grand Designs' (the latter has some brilliant bass playing from Geddy) are probably the best on offer, while 'Mystic Rhythms' and 'Manhattan Project' have keyboard overload that it makes you wonder if Alex forgot to bring his guitars to the studio. Remaining tracks 'Big Money', 'Territories' and 'Marathon' are OK, but sound much better live. Multi-layered vocals were introduced for the first time and work quite well, and the musicianship is as proficient as ever. But 'the principle gets left out' (lyric from 'Grand Designs'), the principle of Rush's music being the guitar coming first. 2.5 stars"
2,Incredible,"Incredibly bad that is. I did actually get images of rainbows and Skittles adverts when my friend (who, incidentally, hugly regretted buying this 'masterpiece') showed it to me. This is barely rock half the time; it just has a synth-laden cheesey happy pop sound most of time. Admitadly, what they're doing is far more ambitious than any pop band, but that is still the sound they have. Sure, these guys are talented - not a doubt! But what does that count for when the music is plain horrible? I've listened to Images & Words and Operation: Mindcrime far too many times to bother with this."
2,"Three Overly-Serious Fish, Sans H2O","I bought this album when I was 17, and I remember at the time thinking the boys sounded uninspired and more than a tad uncomfortable negotiating those fluorescent blue mid-80s waters. I'm 38 now, and the boys still sound uninspired and more than a tad uncomfortable negotiating those fluorescent blue mid-80s waters. Pretty wild, huh?"
2,A slight case of overbombing...,"""Power Windows"" is really a powerful album, but it is absolutely not my cup of tea. Many songs remind me of this stupid ""faster, louder, harder""-attitude of the '80s. ""The Big Money"" says it all:Horrible guitar-solos, thundering drums with lots of echo, layer by layer of squeaking synths--all systems set on maximum effect. This is really pop-metal at its worst! ""Power Windows"" is a very uncool album. It sounds ridiculous and overblown today, because many musicians show their virtuosity in a more subtle way. For me, the gap between ""Moving Pictures"" and Rush's mid-'80s work is very wide. I'm giving two points, because the musicianship is still impressing on this record, and the whole affair sounds more thrilling than on the sterile ""Grace under Pressure"". Nevertheless, if you want to hear ""Worst of the '80s"", buy this album!"
4,One of their best albums!,"The eighties were a period in which a lot of rock bands relied in an increased manner on keyboards:Van Halen,The Rolling Stones,etc.and Rush are no exception...except for this album and 1981's'Moving Pictures'and 1989's'Presto'.A great album that has a more guitar-oriented sound than 'Grace Under Pressure'(1984)-the keyboards are still there but just in the right measure in order to give their sound a larger dimension;still powerful,intelligent,even haunting,this album is a keeper!"
5,One of their strongest albums,"This was the third Rush album I bought as a kid, and it remains one of my favorites to this day. Their synthesizer work, while different from much of their previous work, is strong, and the songs are a lot of fun.This album was much stronger than their earlier Grace Under Pressure album, in that the lyrics are better crafted and the sounds of the various instruments are better integrated. Grace Under Pressure always sounded ""rushed"" to me (no pun intended), sounding like the synthesizer was laid down first, and the other instruments were sort of added around it. Here, the instruments are used in a more balanced way, and the outcome is one of Rush's most melodic efforts. This is especially true for Mystic Rhythms, but it also characterizes the other songs.All-in-all, Power Windows is one of Rush's best, and, without a doubt, one of the best albums from a decade filled with great music."
2,Keyboard washed lackluster effort.,"While I ardently defend ""Grace Under Pressure"" from criticism for its difference in sound from earlier Rush albums, this one is really largely indefensible. ""Power Windows"" opens great, with the fun, rocking ""Big Money"", which has more drive and energy than anything the band's done in ages, some great funky bass playing, killer guitar work from Lifeson, and a powerful lead vocal from Geddy Lee.But the album goes downhill after this, sadly. The rest of the album in general is just lackluster-- ""Manhattan Project"" is ok and ""Mystic Rhythms"" is actually quite good, but songs like ""Marathon"", ""Middletown Dreams"", and well, virtually everything else on here are all ok, but none of them feel inspired, or particularly interesting.This is really an album for completionists and fans only, everyone else should skip this one."
3,Fifthy Fifthy,"This cd contains four really great Rush songs and four ordinary ones.My choice for the best would go to ""The Big money"", ""Manhattan Project"", ""Marathon"" and finally ""Mystic Rythms""The other tracks are weaker and far below these four gems."
3,A reasonably good book on doing Seattle with kids,"Generally good content on fun things do with children in the Seattle area. Few overall maps make it less practical for ""in-car"" use and for non-Seattle natives who aren't terribly familiar with the regions. Organized by type of activity, so it doesn't answer the question of ""what's interesting to do around here or nearby?"""
3,Stainless Steel Bread Box,"For the price of the Item, I was a little dissapointed about this bread box. The package Box of the bread box says it is from WMF, but the stamp of WMF on this bread box I can't find on it :( This product looks more like a Mail Box. It is steardy and will probably never break. The bread does stay longer fresh in it.So all in one, don't buy it, if you want the looks, but buy it if you want it for the freshness and lastness of your breads!!!!"
3,Cleaning?,"This box has all the virtues others describe, I don't find it flimsy, but....How--unless you are the size of a loaf of bread and can work from inside--do you clean the inside of the lid? It is riveted in place so, as built, cannot be removed. Bolts with wingnuts would solve the problem, or some cleverer gizmo."
3,OK...... Yes......,"OK...... Yes...... I purchased this breadbox and it is all the wonderful things that everyone says it is. Based on the reviews, I was under the impression that this product was made in the UK. Instead, this product was made in China. That being the case, why are we paying $100.00 for it? Does anyone even care? I wish I had known. Amazon should inform us where each product we are buying has been manufactured. Then at least we can make the choice, before we buy, whether to support China, ourselves, or someone else. Two stars deleted based on country of origin."
5,middle-age crisis,"I like both this book and Joan's first book, A Year by the sea. I like her written style and her honesty. When I read this book, I feel my heart beat and try to find out what is going to happen. It is a great book! As a woman, I understand her situation. I feel sorry for her. However, I just wonder how Robin (her husband) thinks of these two books. These two books unveiled their unfinished marriage, just like be naked in front of the public. I don't think I would like my husband to write and published our relationship ""in public."" And, I also wonder how her grown up children feel about the books? Will they feel comfortable about their parent's ""problem"" to be known? Will the books help their marriage? Well, I don't know. Probably I will have an answer as soon as Joan publishes her third book."
5,Fabulous Book,"Joan Anderson shares a very personal account of her challenges to re-build a stale marriage after ""running away from home"" for A Year By The Sea. It is full of honest,bittersweet and profound feelings and thoughts of how does woman stay in marriage when she has finally found herself. A great read after "" A Year by the Sea""."
5,Well done!,"Married women should consider this as a great resource to growing into their marriage and their life. Whether just married or married for years,...it applies to all."
5,Wonderful Book!,"This book is definitely a keeper to be read again and again. It not only helped me to understand myself better, but gave me an insight into what my mother went through 25 years ago before any woman was able to express her feelings without drawing criticism. Back then, I guess women were supposed to live through their husband's lives instead of creating their own. Joan shows how we should dig deeper to find our true selves and listen to the voice within. Thanks Joan....Your book is better than a therapy session! Your comments, thoughts and insights are priceless."
1,Stupid Movie,Doesn't so Okinawa like a local would see it. Sohows it like a tourist with no local knowledge would. He just took a ravel book and camera and filmed what it said he should do in a book. Complete rubbish
2,Boring,It was more like a nature video with stupid jokes. I saw more of the his family than Okinawa.
4,The album that transformed Rush.,"Signals took Rush's ever present philosophical, poetic and fantastical vision and made the band a voice towards the social makeup of the 20th Century. With the poignant look at the social stratum in Subdivisions, or the dismal reality in Losing It, the band were able to make us look at what we were, are and will always be. Signals is not a political statement but a human outlook, void of stats or judgment. Though each song is a complete work, the album in its entirety is a short novel of who we are if we are willing to take the challenge."
5,Under-appreciated but still a grand effort!,"Okay, so the eighties marked the ""accepted"" end of prog-rock. But very few people seem to appreciate bands like Rush survived because they went with the times. Signals has been detracted for such lame excuses like ""poor production"" or ""it's not the hard-rock Rush of the seventies."" Get a clue, it wasn't the seventies anymore! Signals is a wonderful album, filled with power and still retaining the Rush trademark tempo-changes and concept themes. ""Subdivisions"" is one of their grandest efforts, almost epic quality (though nobody will argue whether or not it's better than ""2112""). The rest of the album pulses with great synthesizer work from Lee, and an incredible solo from Lifeson on ""The Analog Kid."" The album is unfortunately under-appreciated. Too bad, becuase if Rush had to survive in the eighties, it would have to be with music as great as this."
3,Synth-heavy sequel to Moving Pictures,"This album kicks off memorably with the dark synthesizer fanfare of ""Subdivisions""; the rest of this album reflects that initial sound, with Rush's guitar-dominated sound retreating behind increasingly prominent synths. Some of the tunes here really work -- ""Subdivisions"", ""The Weapon"", and especially ""The Analog Kid"". Other tunes are less successful -- ""Chemistry"" is downright embarrassing in terms of lyrics, ""Countdown"" is merely forgettable, and the ballad ""Losing It"" fizzles after a promising start. This album also includes Rush's only top 40 single, the catchy ""New World Man"". Overall this is a good album but not among Rush's best. Fans of the older material may be turned off by the synthesizers, while people who dislike Geddy Lee's screeches on the 70s albums may find this CD to be more palatable."
5,Rush is not a one-dimensional rock or metal band.,"Signals is the best example of why Rush is a thinking person's band. Whether male/female, rock/metal/pop music fan; listeners of Rush music are cheating themselves unless they fully grasp and appreciate the powerful lyrics catapulted by their great sound. ""Subdivisions"" is my favorite Rush tune. ""Subdivisions"" is a clear statement of our Eurocentric society and it could be hinting at our ""nonexistent"" class (caste) system. The peer pressure to conform and fit in or be cast out; no dreamers, no misanthropes. Keeping up with the Joneses begins early in life. Fit in, don't be assertive, don't be aggressive; stand out for the ""right"" reasons; go along to get along. Was ""Subdivisions"" an allusion to George Orwell's 1984? Or a slap to our image-conscious and materialistic society?"
5,First Album Of The Synth-Era.,Signals is their first album to use synthesizer as the lead instrument and the best. Digital Man is one of my favorite Rush songs ever. Signals might use synthesizer as the lead instrument but it still has quite a bit of guitar in it. It's similar to Moving Pictures but just a bit more electronic and atmospheric. Signals isn't as good as their late '70s and earlier '80s releases but it's still solid.
4,A Great New Sound,"This album marks a major change in the band's sound. Up until now every album was noted for it's strong, often complex riff-rock. However, with this album, the band chose to put away the guitar riffs and longer conceptual pieces and work on tightening up the rhythm section, bringing keyboards more to the forefront, introducing more melodies and keeping the songs more concise.The result is their tightest sounding album up to this point. While the heavy guitars are not present here as in the past, the band has not lost any steam. The interplay between Lee and Peart has grown tremendously and the result is an air-tight rhythm section (something that would continue to this day).Lifeson's guitars take on a more emotional and textural role and the results is very refreshing.Standouts here are Subdivisions, Analog Kid, Digital Man and Losing It."
5,Rush - Signals,"Rush is one of my all time favorite bands. Signals was among one of the first 3 Rush CDs I bought at the tender age of 8 (the other two being Moving Pictures and 2112). Ultimately, it's my favorite Rush album. I've learned at least 4 of these songs on drums, and the melodies are ingrained in my brain. Signals has been a major musical gem in my life and a influence on me as a drummer and music-lover."
5,The Third Part Of Rush's Ultimate 80s Trilogy,"SIGNALS is the third installment in Rush's ultimate trilogy of wonderful 80s studio albums. Neil Peart had apparently overcome his Ayn Rand fixation and was writing lyrics with more heart and soul than he had in the 70s. For example, ""Subdivisions"" is about high-school cliquishness, but could apply to anywhere where, if you're not part of ""the in crowd"", people will side with your parents or other authority figures against you, and ""New World Man"" is about the very nature of the modern human race. This album will keep you thinking for hours about the world and how you and others can make a difference in changing it for the better."
5,Many great unknowns here,"Rush is a well known, but not listened to enough, group. Complete innovation.There are some well known Rush tracks here, such as Subdivisions, many of which are featured on the Chronicles and Retropective CDs. However, there are some lost gems here. One of my favotites, Losing It, is one. Great feel, and the many interesting beats that is a hallmark of Rush are featured, including an 11/8 jam towards the end. Countdown, the last track, is also like this...two measures of 4/4 and then a triplet thrown on the end. Great feel for a great track.If you have no idea what I'm talking about, try tapping your foot to these pieces, and you'l find out there's something odd here. But, it sounds so correct and fluent. Again, this is Rush's legacy to the genre. Get this album, listen to it, and from it you will learn more about real music."
3,Transition album from guitar edged rock to synth driven rock,"The tracks on this album are great, however, the sound is not as clear as previous or subsequent albums. The album, I think, serves as the transition between the more traditional rock sound of guitars, base and drums, to the addition of synthesizers and guitar effects. I unintentionally skip signals when I think of Rush, I do enjoy most of the tracks."
3,Good but not great as Moving Pictures,"I'm not a great fan but I like the band at a moderate level.Moving Pictures was a five stars album, without a doubt.Signals is good but not great. There is some truly good songs on this one but there is also some weaker ones. My choice would go, for the best of Signals as this...Subdivisions, The analog kid, The weapon, New world man and Countdown. The other three songs, Chemistry, Digital man and Losing it are not as good as the other mentionned above. For me, this one deserve three stars, but close to four !"
4,"good album, great band","after just seeing Rush perform live for the Snakes and Arrows tour, I realized that I did not yet have this release on CD. It has some excellent songs and some good songs. No bad songs. Subdivision and Digital Man are classics. The universal political views and historical portrayals lend a imeless feel to this 20 year old release. The themes are still very relevant, if not more obvious, today than when the songs were written. A must have!"
4,Signals Crossed,"Rush's 1982 album Signals contains one of their most popular songs, ""Subdivisions"". It is a classic song about the perils of teen life in the suburbs. Championing the call to be your own person instead of conforming to what the cool kids in school do, it has become a battle cry for nerds and outcasts everywhere. While ""Subdivisions"" is now the most remembered song from the album, it also contains Rush's lone American top 40 song, ""New World Man"". It's not only surprising that the band has had only one top 40 hit, but that it's this almost forgotten song from their vast catalog. The album closes with ""Countdown"" which about the launching of the Space Shuttle Columbia which was inspired from the band's visit to the Kennedy Space Center to watching its initial launch."
4,Another direction............,"After the success of the Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures, Rush decided to tinker with their sound and approach. Signals is dominated by keyboards and Geddy's voice has mellowed, however they keep with the science and technology themes. Some of the best songs are Subdivisions, Chemistry, Digital Man, and New World Man. My only complaint with Signals is the awful sound of Alex Lifeson's guitar."
2,and down we go,"When this album came out it made me embarassed to say I was a rush fan.Cheesey synthesisers and boring compositions take over on this release.In my opinion Rush never got their magic back from this point on.After hearing this album I felt grateful for having seen them on the Perminent Waves tour.If you like seventies Rush,don't buy this or you will be highly dissapointed."
1,One must put up barriers....,"...to protect oneself from the Peart's and Portnoy's of this world. Don't buy this album for the ""great drumming"" unless you like your drumming busy and soulless."
5,Not a bad start....,"Well being that Barry deposited nearly 4 millions dollars and only got fined $11,311.81 thats better than being taxed on that nearly 4 millions dollars!The establishment is just too powerful for the wrong reasons and this is a prime example of it. Barry's tapes from way back in the 70's (that I began using in the early 80's) have freed probably millions of peoples minds of the following mass that was orchestrated by the greedy and powerful that preceded it.I've used just one technique in that book when it first came out and it saved my alot of problems still...It takes real leaders in this country to break free from the tangled web that people have let our government become."
2,Very poor product,I've just returned the banjo to the seller after trying to get it in tune for the last couple of weeks. I'm not sure what was wrong with this banjo but I could not get it to even sound close to what a banjo should sound like. I will point out that Musician's Friend has been easy to work with so far. I'll post an update after they receive my return as far as how quickly they credit my refund and if they charge me a restocking fee (they shouldn't as I've returned everything to them in the original packing and in perfect condition).
5,Great banjo. Not a toy.,"If you are a banjo newbie or you would like to have an EDC(Every Day Carry) banjo to augment your Goldtone, this a great banjo for the money. Setup is simple, install the bridge (no problem, just place the bridge so that the 12th fret is midway between the bridge and the nut) then tune 'er up and if a string buzzes, just turn the union nut on the underside of the banjo by hand to raise the strings up a bit. You now have a rough and ready versatile companion to accompany you by the camp fire or dazzle your friends with some claw hammer licks. The banjo also stays pretty much dead on tuned all the time."
3,Fret Buzz,"Sounded okay for a couple of weeks, then the larger D string began buzzing on several frets. I tried tapping the frets down, and then had to file 2 of them, all for not. If I had it to do again, I would have bought a better quality banjo, but will probably try to fix myself, as there are no local stores here that sell or service banjos."
4,Perfect Gift,My boyfriend LOVED it. It was for our 5th anniversary (wood) and he appreciated the extra string (5 string). The beginner pack is perfect! THe quality is great and it is simply beautiful. GREAT gift for the price!
2,Didn't work,"Nice quality kit, but we never got any living triops. I am a school teacher and we tried three separate times to ""hatch"" our little eggs and it simply never worked. It appeared that we had all of the elements in place correctly. My little students were very disappointed."
2,Does not come with detritus.,"I purchased this pack of triops originally because it states that it comes with food AND nutrients. Nutrients being the little teabag of dead leaves that contains microscopic organisms for baby triops to feed on.It did not come with it. Dunno if I just got a bunk pack or what, but, it didn't have it.I've raised triops MANY times in the past, and have always had one of those litle detritus bags with the kit. These kits *WILL NOT* work without that pack.You may have luck with using a carrot shaving as instructed by this kit, but honestly, it's hit or miss due to whether or not that carrot came in contact with something not so nice for triops.If you're going to buy triops, go to ebay. You can get everything you need there for about 5$ cheaper."
1,Do They Really Live More Than A Week?,I have bought 2 seperate kits and this one lasted longer but still died after a week... Followed directions exactly as stated!
3,Never grew,"We followed the directions meticulously, and finally gave up. I am sure it is something we did wrong, and not a bad product, but I gave it a lower review because the complexity involved seems to be unreasonably exact for them to work."
1,not that great,it took hours to set up and nothing hatched it was not worth the money I would not tell anyone to buy this
1,Terrible item and did not work,"This item was horrible. I followed directions and it appeared that the triops were moving around at first, after a day or two they all died. Maybe I received a bad batch of eggs? My children were disappointed and I would like a refund.Sincerely,Amazon ShopperKarla SmithThis item would be difficult to send back and we threw away the box:("
5,Triassic Triops,"Man, these guys are so fun. I loved growing these guys, worrying that I did something wrong, and watching tiny flecks show up in the water. Then, after a few days, they've grown quite large. I managed to have a SeaMonkey in there too, so, it was double the fun. I have 8 Triops, none ate each other, as the others have stated. Though, I've made sure that they are all fed pretty well, and they are pretty equal in size, so, it seems kind of pointless to go after one of their own when they could potentially die in the process and they have plenty of food around them. They did eat the SeaMonkey though once they caught up to its size. This is incredibly fun, detailed, and worth MUCH more than $15. It's a truly fascinating experience."
1,Total Flop,My son was looking forward to growing his tripos but had no success. He tried twice and used the spring water recommended. It was so sad to watch disappointment on his face on his daily checks. We had success with another brand so we don't think it's our user's error (unfortunately it was 5 years ago and we can't remember which one we bought.) Hopefully you will have success like some of the other reviewers.
3,Mine surrived,I bought this for my son (not from Amazon though) we did everything per the instructions and waited only to have nothing happen. We only used a third of the eggs at a time. Finally our last attempt we got 2. They are still alive and kicking after 2 1/2 months. I have changed their water twice now and my son feeds them regularly. They are pretty cool little critters IF you can get the eggs to hatch.
2,I prefer Seamonkeys,"I bought this triops kit with a seamonkeys kit, and I have to say I enjoyed the seamonkeys more. Triops are much harder to raise and everything has to be perfect for them to hatch. However, seamonkeys are incredibly easy to raise and require less effort. I'm not going to bash on the triops because I never got them to hatch so I don't know how fun they are. However, I would like to say that triops and little kids won't be a good combination because they require a lot of work to hatch and raise.Also, I'm not too sure about the directions provided with this kit to raise triops because I found conflicting directions online which I heard yields better results. Overrall, this kit didn't work for me and I followed the directions exactly as they were in the kit therefore I'm not too happy with my purchase. I would recommend anyone who decides to buy this to find and follow directions that are online and ignore the ones that are in the kit."
4,cool pet for children,My daughter loves this pet. Temperature is an issue so your child will need to be attentive. Full maturity in two weeks!
2,Disappointed,"I followed the directions and suggestions to the ""T"" and my eggs never hatched. There's enough eggs for 3 times and not one egg hatched. Very disappointed with this purchase."
1,MY FIVE YEAR OLD WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED,"My five year old son was really excited to get his Triops hatched, of course Amazon did a great job shipping the item, but after keeping to strict instructions (which included going to the store and having to purchase (Mountain stream water) and (a carrot) both are indicated in the instructions. (oh also you have to have a lamp over them for up to 24 hours a day, ...so make sure you have a goose neck lamp....and then finally NOTHING, they never hatched, what a dud ! When we waited way past the time period of hatching we decided to put it away, my son said ""I hate Triops"""
1,NONE HATCHED,"I ordered two of these kits for my friends kods. I followed ALL directions on box exactly ( I also had these when I was a kid) and not one egg hatched. I contacted seller and they never responded to my emails. I just asked if they could send new eggs or tell me who I can talk to for egg replacment. Now Im stuck with a container without neat Triops, and only good for a Betta fish. I do not recomend buying from these guys because their shipments must be all duds. Waste of $40...."
1,didn't work..,Triops 'science ' experiment. After searching high and low for the correct water to buy- finally found it ..then purchased the heating lamp so the water would stay warm enough..started to project and nothing happened..
1,Total Waste,"This is the biggest waste of money and such a horrible disappointment to my 9 year old son. He has tried to hatch eggs twice now and still NOTHING! Apparently if you are not EXACTLY precise in every single movement and step it just doesn't work. Had I known this I never would have purchased it for him for a Christmas present as he is crushed that he doesn't have ""Triassic Triops"" now."
5,"Fast, Easy, Fun","A great first hand account of Hollywood shenanigans by a reporter on the scene with a great sense of humor, and a great sense of people."
5,The Real Diet Book,"""The REALity DIET"" is the best diet/lifestyle book I have read in a long while. It is easy to read with a light style that keeps the reader interested. It is better than the The South Beach Diet because it is written in a more engaging style. It has good recipes and varied, interesting menus that are more likely to appeal to the serious dieter and keep him/her on the diet. ""THE REALity DIET"" is a highly recommended book."
3,"Good ideas, lots of work","I found the eating ideas interesting, and maybe they will help me. BUT the recipes are very time consuming. The book tells you that you can eat out, but does not give very clear guidelines. I think it is much too time consuming a program to follow, and I wish I had know over half of the book was recipes, not ideas and guidelines like I was looking for. I wish I would have save my $20+."
2,9 words extended into 400 pages,"Eat two grams of fiber for every 90 calories. That's it. That's the book. To some degree, that's the case with a lot of these diet books, but most of them reward the investment with a wealth of health information, nutritional studies, and medical data. This book is light on the writing, heavy on the filler -- a couple hundred pages of menu options, for instance. I couldn't shake the feeling that this was a rather cynical moneymaking gambit -- a Florida cardiologist trying to capitalize on the South Beach Diet by coining the 2:90 brand.In any case, there's nothing wrong with the book, or the advice it contains. Eat more fiber -- go on, do it. But this isn't a very good book, and the whole thing was too rife with self-conscious branding for me to enjoy."
5,An easier diet to follow than most,"There are so many diet books on the market that there hardly seems room for yet another but The Reality Diet: Lose The Pounds For Good With A Cardiologist's Simple, Healthy, Proven Plan is truly different: it comes from a president of one of Florida's largest cardiology practices, it's designed to include foods you like such as pasta and waffles, and it provides separate exercise routines for men and women, along with tips on handling restaurants and holidays. The result's an easier diet to follow than most, and comes with the authority of a M.D. specializing in heart care."
1,Reality Diet Needs a Reality Check,"Fundamentally, except for the fiber shtick, it is a calorie in/calorie out diet, which requires dieters not only to count calories but food groups. Schnur is paying lip service to healthy eating, but this diet is a contemporized version of Weight Watchers without the points. Too onerous to follow. As far as I am concerned, the Reality Diet is not based on any reality. Calorie counting is dead."
5,Wow! I can eat REAL food!,"Imagine a diet where you can eat bread, meat, veggies, fruit, dairy and even wine occasionally! This is it! Almost nothing is off limits as long as it's got fiber to balance the fat. Lose weight, feel full, and know you're eating healthy with fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain breads, and proteins. Behave yourself during the day and enjoy a large strawberry shortcake with whole wheat waffle ""shortcake"", fresh strawberries, and whipped cream as a treat. Every day has the reward of a delicious treat! Weight came off quickly and easily and I didn't feel restricted. Even found some new favorites."
5,Nice,Another nice educational tool for kids and adults. I love to show the kids that I can light up florescent bulbs while holding them in my hand. This Van deGraaf Generator (static generator) works great. I like to experiment with static and teach the kids about it. Nice product.
2,This book reads more like a screenplay than a novel,"I have not seen the movie DR. STRANGELOVE yet, because I wanted to read the book first. Unfortunately, the book turned out to be nothing more than an extended treatment of the screenplay. The characters themselves were unremarkable and undistinguishable. Most of the comedy seemed flat, largely because it was based on sight gags rather than situational humor.Even though this book was based on the movie, the movie's screenplay was originally inspired by another Peter George novel, RED ALERT. Peter George worked with Stanley Kubrick and Terry Southern to write the screenplay."
1,what a disappointment!,My daughter really wanted this necklace so against my better judgment I purchased it for her.What a disappointment. The first week the satin cord came out of the clasp and we had to glue it back in. Next the crystal (small as they are) started popping out. After 1 month there is nothing left - and we threw it away last night. $30 is not a lot of money unless of course you are buying junk.
4,My Review,I loved the idem that i recived. although i did not like what the string was made out of it seems somewhat cheep! other then that i loved the colors the lay out and all around good. I Love Paris Hilton!
2,my review,I am 14 years old and I really like Paris Hilton's new jewellery line. The only things I don't like on her jewellery line is this star necklace and the heart necklace on the satin cord. I love all the other pieces but I will probably only buy the star earrings and the heart belly button ring as I just got my belly button pierced. I think its great that I can get jewellery that virtually knowone else will have because I live in the UK.
3,Good but not soo good,"I found with this album it wasn't the real Rush, I find it wasn't orignial enough. Also I was very impressed with the drum work of John Rutsey, but like some bands without one member it just isent the same. I am a HUGE Neil Peart fan, The band wasent the same without him, i think he was one of the most brilliant drummers ever, alot of the songs are made by his drummer, but also some of the songs are made from the outstand bass guitar or vocals. I rate this album 3 star's the reason for it is because i dotn really like it, but it is good. I am just alot used to Good old Neil Peart Geddy lee and Alex Lifeson, They are Rush"
2,A Lackluster Debut,"Classic rock bands such as Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple all had really strong debut albums. Rush did not. The lyrics on this CD are all very amateurish, especially the lame rocker In The Mood. John Rutsey is an okay drummer but he cannot hold a candle to Neil Peart. Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee show promise as the great musicians that they are but the album comes across as too Zepellinesque. The only worth while song here is Working Man. The band did have to start somewhere and they did get better. This is for die hard fans only."
4,LED ZEPPELIN ARE OVERRATED GARBAGE!,"Will you people stop comparing Rush to Led Zeppelin! Led Zeppelin are the most overrated band of all time!Why does every other band get compared unfavourably to Led Zeppelin, but never vice versa, huh?I really want to know.Let me say that Led Zeppelin copied The Who, Cream, Blue Cheer and old blues like Muddy Waters.As for the album, it is much heavier and louder than anything Led Zeppelin ever did-Led Zeppelin(when they used electric guitars) were never ""heavy"", they just had a harsh,hard sound-no power.Their songs aren't even all that good either.I think it's high time the music community did a serious re-evaluation of Led Zeppelin."
4,Raw Rush deserves a listen,"With their first (official) release, Rush sets the stage for their illustrious career.This work isn't like other Rush pieces, but then again, which works are?That's the magic and beauty of Rush. Their sound evolves.As 'Rush' is a perfect stage to start that evolution.Raw power is evident in this first shot at stardom.It's worth a listen."
3,This one isn't too bad.,"Before Neil Peart entered the Rush scene this album was released. It's not as good as all the other early Rush music, but it still has got some really solid songs. The only thing absent is Neil's excellent drumming and Neil's beautiful song writing. The guitar and bass are amazing on this Cd. The drumming isn't bad, but Neil is much better."
3,A Good Start...,"The first Rush album is not their best, don't let anyone tell you that. First of all, the album doesn't even feature drummer/lyricist Neil Peart, who has given so much vision, drive and meaning to Rush's later material.Enjoy this album more for it's honesty and integrity, not for it's lyrics or strong songwriting. Sure, it has some excellent tunes, like ""Working Man"" and ""Finding My Way""...but the rest is mostly forgettable.This is merely a starting point. Most of the things Rush are loved for aren't present on this album."
3,THIS IS RUSH - YOUNG AND EVER GROWING,"WORKING MAN, WORKING MAN, WORKING MAN. its amazing how that song has stayed with this huge fan for so many years. this album is a start for two young, and learnig musicians. the led zep influence is present right from the get-go. mr. peart was not available for this not so bad work. go to a show and hear a three song medly from RUSH'S most immature album. just remind yourself that it gets unbelievable awsome from here. this is the most underrated super group around. that just shows that canadians get no respect. my personal favorite era of the boys is, signals to hold your fire. remember that we all learn from out mistakes and alex and getty are no exception. hello neil, thank you."
3,"Good, but a little disappointed","Rush's first album is a good album but not their best. I suggest you to buy ""Fly By Night"" or ""Caress of steel"". These for begginers rush fans."
3,"No Neil, but fun nevertheless","Take this album for what it is, and you'll love it. No, it is not by any stretch a great piece of musical literature, but it is fun.Unfortunately, the only thing Rush ever plays live off of this album is In the Mood, by far my least favorite song.I wish they would play Before and After live. Oh well, one can dream."
3,For completists only,"Their first album, and it should be taken as such. There are some strong efforts on this album, like ""Working Man"" and ""Finding my Way"", but the rest is uninspired. All the essential pieces are included in ""Chronicles"", ""Retrospective 1974-80"" and even ""All the World's a Stage"", so this album is a necessity for hardcore fans only."
3,Is this REALLY the same band that recorded Moving Pictures?,"Well, no, not really. The band that recorded this album was three kids in their early 20's who really dug bands like Led Zeppelin and Cream.And it is almost painfully obvious how much they liked Zep and Cream, because on this album more than any that followed it, Rush is wearing their influences on their sleeves. The main riff of ""Take A Friend"" is a blatant ripoff of ""Whole Lotta Love,"" for example.Although the album bristles with energy, Geddy Lee just wasn't quite the lyricist that Neil Peart is (to be fair, Ged did write a few later Rush tunes, and the lyrics of My Favorite Headache aren't too bad). And John Rutsey's drumming is only slightly more creative than Phil Rudd's. And this album has the most unpretty cover of anything Rush ever did.But, hey, it's got ""Working Man."" And there are plenty of brief flashes of what they would later become, even if most of the songs don't age well."
5,Great Rocker!,"I think this is a very good first album and enjoy listening to it time and time again. This album isn't as technical as other Rush albums or sounds like any other Rush albums, but I feel each Rush album is unlike any others. This album has a nice raw feel to it and the band didn't have the resources to spend much time in the studio. There are no keyboards or much else other than the guitar, bass and drums. ""Working Man"" is probably the strongest song on the album, but I think that all these songs are of good quality ""Finding My Way"" has one of my favorite riffs and ""What You're Doing"" and ""In The Mood"" have been performed live a lot over the years. This is the only album without probably one of the greatest drummers of all-time Neil Peart, but the drummer on this album John Rutsey is very solid and his style does suits these songs well."
2,Ya gotta start somewhere...,"The playing has more attitude than technique. The songs are amateurish, the production is muddy (even on the remaster), and the album cover is just plain ugly.That said, this album was made just as the band were exiting their teens, was recorded in the wee hours of the morning, often after a string of gigs, with what could only be described as a non-budget.Neil had yet to join.I would reccomend this album because it showcases a powerhouse band's humble, hardworking roots. I reccomend everything after for the music."
4,"Rush, no peart; not quite Zeppelin?","This is a really good album in so many words, and anyone who likes rush and/or zeppelin would be able to appreciate it. It is incomareable to the amazing things they would do later but is still really good; it does have something special in how light hearted and sort of with a rockin' optimstic aura.John Rutsey is infact a pretty good drummer and people only find him really bad beacause they compare him to the absolutely spectabular Peart (who wouldnt look like crap beside him).If youre a big zeppelin fan, a big rush fan, or a moderate fan of both, you'll definatly like this retro rush cd which is indeed nothing more but a Led copy. Hey! Its still a good one!"
2,ALMOST FUNNY,"Firstly I am a huge Rush fan , I love nearly everything they dobut this is bad , first album or not its a clunker.Theres nothing about this I like, and if Peart had been aroundat the time I`m sure things would have been different.Rush are a progressive rock band not a LZ clone act.Stay away , keep clear, avoid this at all costsand if anyone trys to tell you its good, try not to laughyes it is that bad its almost funny"
2,"Well, They Had To Start Somewhere!!!","I bought this on vinyl when it first came out. At that time Rush sounded like a cross between Led Zeppelin and Bad Co. Well, it was the 70's so what can you expect??? I find this CD and it's songs very unoriginal. I don't really like any of the tracks except Working Man...Well, they had to start somewhere!!"
2,Rush's first.,"This may be the worst Rush album there is, yet its no worse than some of the other 70's rock albums by the likes of Black Sabbath, Kiss, and Aerosmith. The lyrics are lame, but Lifeson plays some good bluesy leads throughout. The solos to ""Take a Friend"" and ""Working Man"" are excellent."
4,good debut.,"When I first got this album, I didn't really like it. But after about a week or 2 of listening to it, I started to like the whole album, and I still do. ""Finding My Way"", starts off the album rocking hard. ""Here Again"", initially was 7 1/2 minutes of boredom, but now I like it. I think ""What You're Doing"", and ""Working Man"", are the best cuts on the album, even though I like all of them.This does not feature the deep lyrics of Neil Peart, because he wasn't here until the next album, ""Fly By Night"", but, if you want to take a break from his deep intellectual influence on the band and try something that's more loose and free, give this one a try, just don't expect the Rush that we've all come to know with Peart."
3,Pretty solid debut album from a legendary band.,"""Rush"" is a decent debut album. If you read the ""authorized"" book ""Contents Under Pressure"", you'll learn that Rush had been playing these songs for 3 or more years before recording this album, so that means they were teenagers when they wrote these originally (they were 20 when they recorded this). I think if you take that into account, this is actually a surprisingly good album, but obviously nowhere near what they would become, even on the next album ""Fly by Night"". The ""baby baby"" lyrics can be annoying, but the music is decent. ""Working Man"" is a classic song and sounds good even today. Every true Rush fan will own this album, but it's still worthwhile for any fan of 70's hard rock."
4,Are some of you NUTS?,"I am reading some of these reviews with disbelief! This is a great debut album and ""Finding My Way"", ""Working Man"", and ""What You're Doing"" are great tracks. ENJOY IT! and quit tearing it down as it is an EXCELLENT debut. BUT, check out ""2112"" for the best they have to offer..."
5,:),"I Can't give it enough stars because I LOVE RUSH! Welcome to the Rock and Roll Hall of fame, guys!"
3,"3.5 stars- Pretty good debut album, but without Peart, this is not classic Rush","For a debut album, this is a different, but still a good energetic release. They don't do half bad without Peart. The songs are pretty simple and basic and a bit silly, but they still rock really hard. The only song that made me want to listen to this was the track ""Working Man"" because I had heard it played a lot on the radio and thought it was a really cool tune. You kind of wonder what kind of albums they might have made if Peart had never joined the band. The songs ""Take A Friend"", ""Finding My Way"", and ""What Your Doing"" are pretty cool tunes also. There is definitely no mysticism on this debut, but bad boy Peart would soon come to the rescue, and all Rush fans are glad of that. Enjoy!!!"
3,"3.5 stars, actually.","This is a good debut, but usually I like a group's debut much better. What is it about that? The debut of Zeppelin? Great. The debut of Sabbath? Great. Aerosmith, Nugent (solo), Any hair band of the '80s, they all had great debut albums. This one's OK. Rush got better with age. ~~~I could say this about Pink Floyd too, I guess. This one's just not a starting point for listening to Rush."
5,Classic prog metal,"This was a great 1st album by Rush, although the badass on the drum kit(Neil Pert) is not on this album it is still very good. John Rutsey (R.I.P.) is the drummer on this album, although he's nothing to write home about he is a solid timekeeper. This album puts me in the mind set of Zeppelin or early Sabbath, moreso Zeppelin though. Working Man was my farovite track, very Sabbath sounding Tony Iommi would be impressed!!"
3,AMW,"If you like Forgotten Realms novels, then you will certainly enjoy this. Also-check out Forgotten Realms' Horselords, a very entertaining book."
3,bad subject matter but good acting,"This movie was about a guy who had a secure job at a bank that he had stayed with for years earning some respect. He had a nice house (even for England). He had a decent life. But he was lonely. So he went online and ordered up a Russian bride (supposedly because he has no ""time"" to find a local girl). She was definitely not what he ordered and in many ways as you see as the movie unfolds. But in the end we, the audience, are led to believe that ""happiness"" is found in running around with prostitutes and thieves, living out what you watched in pornography, lying about who you are, running from the police, and living in Russia. So in other words this was another movie that claims there is no right and wrong and that to be ""happy"" you have to live in total sin.The only good point of this film was the acting. It was great. Kidman was great. But why do you have to show your talents in such a bad plot?"
3,Import A Woman!,"Here we go again, back to 2001, for my revisitation of the early 2000s in film!Birthday Girl starts with Ben Chaplin, a solitary man seeking a woman. Unfortunately, he resorts to the internet for this. But having a Russian Nicole Kidman can't be too bad, can it?Already strange, she can't speak English, which throws Chaplin off since he was informed otherwise. Humorously, he can't get anyone to address his complaints regarding this false advertising.Nicole is fully prepared to pay for room and board, and leaps in Chaplin's pants before being asked.Then we get some unexpected Russian company coming to visit Nicole, and soon things get very stange indeed.The movie has some comedy, some romance and a thriller in it. Chaplin handles his performance well. There isn't too much to object to, it's just a little lacking. We get the sense that without the big stars it would feel even that much more ho-hum."
4,Nicole Kidman Is So Good In This Must See!!,Nicole Kidman will make you love her and hate her in this movie because of the twist that she plays on Ben Chaplin but you want to see the decision that he finally makes and why.
2,"Kidman is so likable in this movie, but this movie is not","Ben Chaplin (The Thin Red Line, Murder 8y Numbers) plays John, who is this nerdy, bank clerk who sends out for a wife and gets a luscious and absolutely to die for Nadia, played by Nicole Kidman (The Hours, To Die For), whos Russian accent is great. Things start to spring happen for the lovely couple when her birthday hits and her cousin and friend arrive to celebrate but it all turns on Chaplin when the cousin and friend happen to be impostors and so is Kidman. The 3 have a history of doing this. Chaplin robs his bank, is out of job and doesnt know what to think, but in the end, his feelings for Kidman succumb to him. Nicely captured performances by Chaplin and Kidman but this leaves you with wanting a different premise. Vincet Cassel (Brother Hood Of The Wolf, Elizabeth) also stars as Kidman's angry and jelous boyfriend. Also too much subtitles."
2,A bad story.,"No complaints about the actings here. Kidman, Chaplin and even 2 psuedo Russian gangsters played by famous Frenchmen are fine. The story is bad and very PREDICTABLE. No fun at all. Neither romantic nor thrilling. I think custume designer did a good job here, but please AVOID."
2,What a waste!,"Ok, I know this is a low budget film. I know it was not meant to be a big production, it's a low profile job. The trouble was how it was advertised.The cover is a swindle. ""You're in for a big surprise"", says, leading you to expect a highly suspenseful thriller. In the back cover, we have a picture of Ben Chaplin holding a gun in threatening way...Bu we have none of it in the movie, which is a shambles, a real mess. Kidman acting is alright, she's really improving day after day. But the plot.... what plot? The moments meant to be fun are not... The moments meant to be exciting are not.This is a waste of time"
2,This Mail Order Bride Should've Been Returned!,"Nicole and Ben's performances were fine but this movie didn't know if it wanted to be a romantic comedy or an action thriller, it failed at both."
3,something difference,"this movie was low budget and u can tell from watching it but the plot is original enuf to work and the characters are believable. Nicole Kidman is sleazy looking and speaks russians for most of the movie, then vola, she speaks english. the suspense is there to the end and its enjoyable but i would not want to see it again. its kinda slow in the beginning so make sure u have something to munch on."
2,Boring and short birthday,"Nicole Kidman and his couple(In the film)Ben Chaplin are the best of the movie.With a simple but interesting plot, and excellent(Very excellents)actings.But thing gets boring and predictable here, and not evem the beautiful touchs of comedy here can entertein us.A real big shame, poor Nicole."
3,"Not believable, but fun","This movie didn't interest me until after I saw Moulin Rouge. Then I had a sudden desire to see any film that had Nicole Kidman. While this is not a *good* film, it is certainly an enjoyable one, and I would recommend it as a guilty pleasure.I didn't expect much, and I didn't get much. Kidman has a completely believable Russian accent (like I would know the difference) and she looks fantastic as usual. The characters were paper-thin: I didn't care for the banker at all, and I thought the ""cousins"" were more obnoxious than menacing. I found most of the story to shift between somewhat plausible and totally ludicrous. I asked ""Why would they..."" several times before I just stopped bothering.And yet, I watched the movie twice before I returned it to the video store, which I didn't do when I rented ""Citizen Kane"" (which I liked). So make of that what you will..."
3,"Quirky, Offbeat ... but not very believable","I won't bother to summarize the plot of this movie,... Overall I enjoyed it, especially the setup, but it really falls apart quite badly at the end. Almost nothing that happens after the protagonist frees himself from confinement is very believable. Kidman is good, as always, but I can't give this movie more than three stars. OK for a rainy afternoon, but not much more."
2,Amazing actors can't save this train wreck.,"Birthday Girl starring Ben Chaplin and Nicole Kidman starts off as an appealing, strange love story but the film loses its edge 30 minutes in. Kidman is superb as always and Chaplin always gives a quiet, realistic perfomance but even their apparent talents can't spark a weak story. I could see the twist coming a mile away and there's nothing else worth talking about. Birthday Girl is anything but a blaze of glory. Skip it."
4,great film i need to see it again,"This was a goood film and I like miss kidman I love all her work I remember seeing her in the great TO DIE FOR that was a good film.Now this film didn't play very well in 2001,but that ok see I still love this film it has comedy and drama and it's dark as well. Nicole is sexy as hell her body is slim long and lean. And I love her nice creamy white skin this is the film you should buy if your a Nicole Kidman fan."
2,Extremely Awkward,"This movie was really awkward throughout. I don't know what else to say about it as the premise is obvious. It's not really extremely thrilling, but more like I said an extremely awkward movie. No one got killed really but, you'll want to avert you're eyes often during this movie, at the awkward mail order relationship."
2,Mediocre,"Even with Nicole Kidman starring in this movie, it was not her best film. I found the story a bit ridiculous. It seemed to be a low-budget film as well. Pass up on this one."
2,I was confused,"This movie was very confusing. I kept wondering what happened to all of the others that Nicole and her friends robbed; did they kill them? And why did they drag Ben Chaplin with them after he'd done what they wanted? If these people had done murder, then the ending was totally inappropriate. I'd have liked to have seen Ben getting revenge. I was disappointed."
2,A huge disappointment,"Geeky Brit, John (Ben Chapin), sends for a Russian mail order bride via the net and ends up with the sexy Nadia (Nicole Kidman) whose English vocab consists only of the word ""Yes"". (Sounds like the perfect woman to me. Just kidding). John believes he has finally found his soulmate, but things soon go awry when Nadia's cousins make a surprise visit on her birthday, leading to a turn of events which transform BIRTHDAY GIRL from a clumsy and unfunny comedy to a clumsy and not terribly thrilling thriller.BIRTHDAY GIRL is yet another movie in which Kidman's talents are wasted. Her appealing performance is the sole redeeming feature of this slop. And as if that isn't bad enough the tape I viewed ends with the Robbie Williams video ""Something Stupid"" (No!!!)."
3,So-So,"I just saw this on tv this weekend, eh, it's an okay movie to watch on tv but don't buy it. The whole plot was really cliche with the whole ""i'm not who you think I am"" theme. The story was pretty simple and light. It was about a lonely guy who lives in England. He gets a mail order bride from Russia and it turns out that she's a con artist and she makes him steal $90,000 from his office. Thus, he has to hide from the law with her most of the movie. It's pretty entertaining but just a really simple, trite plot. So, if it happens to be on tv and you catch it at the beginning, you should watch it. But it'ss not worth paying money for."
1,One Weird /StrangeFilm,"I have no problem with viewing regular ""sex"" in a R-rated movies,but this was kind of sick and strange. I thought when I rented this -it was going to be like a suspense murder type of mystery and maybe a foriegn woman with a past.Boy! was I mistaken! The dist. should write this movie contain S & M sex in it on the label description.I only watched half it and had to turn it off.I was very diappointed because I normally like Nicole Kidman.The ""Others"" movie was great."
4,Title is deceiving,"I'm guessing the book was retitled to what is now to attract more readers. However, the content doesn't match the title. This is all about the importance of staying fit and being healthy. If that's what you're looking for, this book is for you. But if you're looking to balance work/life, there are better books to purchase."
3,3.5 stars,"I enjoyed this read as it was short and easy to get through but it really goes over the same things that most of these types of books do. I will say that for such a short book its definitely worth the read even if its just to remind yourself of some important concepts you might've forgotten along the way.I really like The One Minute Manager and The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey but most of these ""One Minute"" books are quite similar so I wouldn't necessarily suggest going out and buying any of them. Check them out from the library or borrow from a friend."
5,They were destined to be rock gods,"So why did Mercury Records cut them off their label? This is such a good album with alot of great songs like Simple Sincerity,Little Pink Stars,Still In Wait, and My Guitar. Buy this album now!"
5,"Best grunge album since Pearl Jam's ""Ten.""","Radish's Ben Kweller is an amazing song writer and Radish has amazing talent. These guys are going places. It also helps that drummer John Kent is prett damn hot. Today's Bargain is all-too-true teenage rock anthem. Dear Aunt Arctica is very sad but very well written. My Guitar is, in my opinion, the best song on the album, because Ben talks about his friendship with his guitar and everything related to that topic."
5,They rock!,"Radish is a breath of fresh air,a great escape from rap,or crap,whatever you like to call it.The lyrics are mature and the guitar is awsome.'Little Pink Stars',the opening track,is a great song with a great solo.'Bedtime',the last track is perfect in every way.'Failing and Leaving' is a great teen-age rock song.You can listen to these songs over and over for hours and not get tired of them.Definetly give them a listen."
1,"...well, I think 1 star is too good for them...","These little guys suck. I paid 1.99 for this CD at a used CD store, and I feel ripped off. Hopefully, they will never make another record again, for they will just be wasting good plastic."
3,Nothing original here...,"Radish is a very tight band, and their songs are ok...but I can't really find anything new or exciting here. Very formulaic punk/pop. Not bad, exactly, just not outstanding in any way."
4,Radish: Riding Seattle's Wake,"I bought this cd for Little Pink Stars which alone makes the cd worth buying. Although they're very young, the songs are fairly advanced but also reflective of their writer's age. I'm a huge Nirvana/Screaming Trees/Grunge fan and I think these guys rock. I'd like to see them in concert, or at least put out another album."
5,Dallas Pride,"Radish is one of the best things to come out of dallas since i don't know what. I've been listening to radish since they first came out (1995) and am still not tired of them. I have seen them preform a dozen times and still love their shows. Much love, Jackie"
2,DESERT WARRIOR (1988),"Shari's a prized commodity 20 years after the Third World War - she's the only babe around who doesn't have radiation poisoning. So naturally all the guys want her. When the #1 bad guy gets her, he has one of his guards pull down her top to see if she's contaminated. We briefly see both boobs but the left one is mostly shadowed.Word of warning: avoid the Digiview Ent. DVD, it's an edited version, minus her brief nudity. Yet the included trailer shows it! Weird."
5,An intereesting review of old ways.............,"This book is very good! The author gives instructions and some 'recipes' for living in a by-gone era which I found interesting. While I do not want to go back to that way of living, I did enjoy reading about it!"
1,Move along - you'll thank me later,"I rented, rather than purchased this movie, and boy am I glad. (Although if there was a way to get my rental money back I would.)The concept had the potential to be an all-gay sendup of the the women in prison films - except it looks more like the transition scenes in a gay porno with all the sex cut out. Bad lighting. Bad acting. Bad sets. Bad writing. (You get the picture.) Even the actors look embarassed to be in this one.Oddly, on the DVD, this is also a photo gallery option - that has almost nothing to do with this film. Out of 75 or so shots, only a half dozen come from the film - the rest are gratuitous shots of naked men - apparently from other vidoes (most likely porn) the company owns.The movie: a painful 82 minutes. The DVD: a waste of plastic. Move along to something better - you'll thank me for it."
1,CORNIEST STORY OR NO STORY AT ALL,I bought this DVD and found it to be one of the worse investments I ever had. The storyline is simply corny and the cast is so pathetic. It is like a stage-play-gone-bad with only one type of setting.
1,There should be a support group!,"Yes, a support group for all those who have suffered through this ""movie""! It is indeed the worst movie I've ever seen, however it's so bad it's hysterically funny. This poor film has a huge identity crisis going on, is it soft porn, drama, comedy, or what? Example; towards the end of Cellblock, there is a tense fight scene which takes place in the cell. One of the charecters, (I won't mention who and spoil the fun!), reaches over and grabs a milk CARTON, cracks it against a table and comes at the other with those jagged edges! I think once a year, everyone who has seen this should get together, watch the movie, and then have a great Cellblock Q party afterwards to celebrate the movie ending!"
4,Joy survives the rejection of Nashville,"I have been a fan of Joy for a long time now. It's really depressing that she is not more widely known. How is it fair that Shania Twain is so big, when she is so awful? It is even more maddening that the Dixie Chicks cover of lfjldsjfl has become a huge radio hit when it is so inferior to Joy's cover. I was so excited when I got The Lucky Few because of the songwriters, Jim Lauderdale, and Lucinda Williams. Plus the duet with Dwight Yoakam. Pete Anderson was another name that I already knew. The Lucky Few is a must have in any C.D. collection."
1,This is not a 12 inch bread knife.,"The product arrives in a plastic sleeve identifying it as a ""Deglon 12 - Inch Bread Knife, Black Wood Handle"".Inside is Deglon's packaging saying: ""Blade 8"", Stainless Steel""The blade is 8 inches. Including handle, it comes to 12 but that's not how you measure bread knives. We are returning this since it was falsely advertised."
3,Packed with info,Personally I did not really like this book. My take on it was that it was a personal account/textbook/data and results section all mixed into one. Very slow reading and seems to repeat itself often. On the other hand it is packed with info and you will learn a lot. Good photograph section as well.
1,Not a Text Book,"I had a class in Panama taught out of this book. I don't recommend it for that purpose. If you're interested in learning some general stuff about t he tropics, it's great (If you can stand the author's personality). I find the book to be awkwardly organized and overly repetitive. It's three time's as long as it needs to be for the information it contains. The information within is a mixture of personal observations and widely accepted facts without clearly distinguishing which are which. Save your money, get something else."
5,All you need to know about the neotropics,"This product is a great source of information for anyone who is planning to travel south of the US boarder into Central or South America. The information it contains is advanced enough to answer serious ecology questions, and casual enough for those just wanting to learn more about the environments they will encounter in the tropics on a vacation. It does a nice job detailing how the ecosystems work and provides tips on how to conduct yourself while visiting the neotropics. The book is well written and an interesting read."
1,Hard to Read Edition,"After reading ""Seven Slayers"" (the collection of seven of Paul Cain's short stories) I had to read Cain's one and only novel, ""Fast One."" The only problem was that it was hard to find at a reasonable price. I was glad to see it back in print and available at Amazon.com; however, I was highly disappointed in the Blackmask.com edition (the one star is solely for this specific copy, not the book itself).I admire what Blakmask Online is doing, but they need to take more care in their editing of classic works. The erratic use of punctuation and frequent misspellings make it almost unbearable to read. I feel like I need another edition just to see if what I am reading was actually written by Paul Cain.Ultimately, if you want to enjoy this novel I would suggest picking up a used copy from another publisher. Paul Cain's work deserves much better treatment."
4,Fast and furious,"Excellent story, as expected from the master of hardboiled short fiction - but I found the typesetting and general layout to be rather slap-dash and annoying. If an old classic is to be republished, it should be done with more care."
1,Don't waste your time,"Prof. Baron Joseph A. Uphoff Director, son of God, whatever, I don't know who this guy is, but he shouldn't be writing books. He can come up with titles of books, but he shouldn't flex his literary talent beyond that.I was embarrassed to read this book, the author should definitely be embarrassed to have published it, there is a spelling mistake on the first page and all photographs (the few that are there) are 5th generation photocopies. There is no lineage of any katas beyond the person who taught the author and the ""journey through time"" refers to the author's learning of kusanku, not the kata's journey.Believe me Mr. Uphoff, there are better ways to self publish."
2,There are much better options...,"This pocket guide is OK for showing you what the tracks look like; however, it doesn't differentiate between walkers, bounders, wide walkers/waddlers and leapers. Nor does it tell you what the stride or straddle is, which is a very important aspect. I instead opted for the Mammal Tracker pocket laminated card from Interpretive Wildlife Programs and blew it up a bit (it's kinda small otherwise) and bring a plastic ruler with me. For decent tracking you need to know 1) how big the prints are, 2) the formation they're in, 3) the length of the stride and 4) the width of the straddle. Of course, a basic understanding of the habits and habitat of the mammals you are tracking goes a long way to narrowing things down. If you aren't sure, lay your ruler down next to the prints and take a picture; then you can study it when you get home. Above all...have fun! Try tracking one set of prints as far as they go; you might get lucky and find a den, lay or the animal itself!"
2,Douwe Egbert Coffee,"At my local Yacht Club the Douwe Egbert coffee they serve is probably the best coffee I have ever had. The coffee I ordered on-line is almost the worst coffee I have ever had. There is absolutely no comparison between the Yacht Club Douwe Egbert and the on-line ordered Douwe Egbert. If Douwe Egbert wants to sell more coffee, they are going to have to give it the same taste as what I get at the Yacht Club."
2,Not so hot,"I prefer ball whisks over balloon whisks for most things, and this one does a good job. However, if you try to using it holding it like a pencil, which I usually do unless I'm whisking a stiff batter and can tilt the bowl a lot, it's very uncomfortable in the hand. Also, the heavily weighted handle means that it often falls out of small bowls. Finally, if I use this in a non-stick pan I worry about scratching the coating. I'm going to try the WMF with the plastic handle and silicon balls, hoping that it's more ergonomic and that the handle is lighter."
5,LOVE IT,I have the same whisk in two larger sizes as well. I love them all. I don't know how I ever whipped anything without them!
2,Too stiff,"I had used a longer whisk like this at my sister's house and liked it very much, but this short one was much too stiff. It tends to toss things around the bowl rather than blending them together. I would not recommend this without seeing one face to face. I wish I'd ordered the longer one."
5,Talk about useful,"Earlier, my wife had purchased a larger whisk of this style and loved it. She felt that this smaller version would also be very useful at times. She likes both whisks and uses them frequently. Our friends and neighbors have also heard how well these work and clean."
1,"Comfortable seat, easy assembly - that's it!","It's completely different from description and photo. Open the box to assemble 4 pieces - cushion, seat bracket, pneumatic shock, and wheel base. Look underneath the cushion to find the screws to attach bracket to the seat. After attaching the bracket to the seat, place wheel base on the floor. Put shock into hole on wheel base. Place seat bracket on top of shock. End of assembly.PROS: Seat is comfortable.Wheel base is square with 4 red wheelsEasy assemblyCONS: No all-steel constructionWheels are plasticNot durable - Instead, it's built for occasional, light usagePneumatic shock did not work at allDoes not stay assembled when picked-up by the seatI think the manufacturer substituted a much cheaper-quality seat and did not tell Amazon. With gentle usage it should last one year. If everything worked it would be worth about $20. But definitely not professional quality or worth the money paid."
2,Dont buy it.,"Seat broke on the 1st day, I had to make a new one to repair it. Base is solid, seat adjustment handle is a joke."
3,Needs one more wheel...,"Been in our shop for over a year now, and it is the least used of all our shop seats. Reason is that it only has (4) casters, making it clumsy to use. It does not move as easily as our other (5) caster stools. Also, it does not have the ring shown in the picture, only a lever for up and down adjustment. Would not buy again."
3,Nice Bowling Shoes,The style and fit are fantastic but........ my pair has an odor from day 1 that I just can't get rid of. I even get busted by my team members. I really do like these shoes though and would hope they all don't have the problem I am still experiencing. PS I'm sure I could have sent them back for a different pair.
5,Great Starter for Mandolin - Highly Recommended,"I got a mandolin with no idea how to play it and now I can wow people with my wide repertoire.I must tell you that it certainly did not hurt that I knew how to play guitar and knew how to read tablature before I got this book. But anyone having any playing experience and a knowledge of tabs will have no problem mastering these great sounding songs.. especially with the CD that comes along with it.Most books out there force you to wait through really simple exercises before getting to actual playing. If you know the basics, skip the rest and get these tunes."
2,Doris Disappointment,"The only reason I gave this one a '2' was that it's a very interesting look into Doris Duke's life with alot of insider perspective(one of the co-writers was her chef). However, this book looks entirely unedited and had atrocious spelling, grammer, mistakes ALL OVER and it was unacceptable.BIGGEST EXAMPLE: The author's name is spelled differently on the front cover and side binding. Was there ANYONE proofreading this book?Doris' was constantly spelled Doris'ss or Doris's and words didn't have spaces in between them."
1,Just Awful. Avoid,"Please don't buy this book. Its a rehash of info already covered in the mansfield and pony duke bios. Also the concluding chapters are just brutal as this clumsy author attempts to speculate on the motives of the motley crew surrounding doris at the end. An unconvincing, tacky, insensitive book that gives us no insight into the complex woman doris duke was."
1,Case study in poor proofreading!,"After being appalled at the endless spelling errors and typographical mistakes in this book, I decided to look up the author, Ted Schwarz. He's a Cleveland resident who claims to have written over 100 books at the rate of 10 pages a day. No one should write 100 books in one lifetime. I would suggest that Schwarz spend a little less time writing, and a little more time proofreading. Lay some blame as well on Vivisphere Publishing, whoever they are.The problem here is that, if you want to know something about Doris Duke, you don't have a lot of decent choices. She may be the exemplary personification of the problems of enormous inherited wealth in the U.S. Her life deserves a scholarly and respectful biography. Maybe one day a skilled biographer and a competent publisher will bring it to us."
2,Yuck,"I did not find the book particularly written well. It does not keep your interest going. There are no photos. But even more than this, is the subject matter--Doris Duke. I find her to be a very bad example of a human being. Who cares who much money she gave out. She was self absorbed and has made no significant contribution to this world."
5,fantastic artist!,"I would love to see his place in person sometime~A coffee table book,lots of fun to look at! I oftenlearn more by seeing how another artist creates~inspiring and often whimiscal"
4,A very good reference volume.,"There aren't many fencing reference books out there in the marketplace today, but this is a good one. Lots of interesting facts about the sport of fencing, although the book's focus is dominated by a British and European bias to the exclusion of much of the rest of the planet (to be expected, perhaps, since the author, E. D. Morton, is British). Still, there is much to learn from MARTINI A-Z OF FENCING. As a writer and fencing master, I recommed it"
2,Introduction to C++ class design,"This book does not cover programming style in the traditional usage of the term. There is no discussion of general programming practice, naming conventions, documentation, commenting, formatting, and layout. The best target audience for this book is newcomers to C++ having difficulty with class design. Chapters on abstraction, consistency, inheritance, virtual functions, operator overloading, wrappers, and multiple inheritance provide solid guidance. The author repeats principals in multiple chapters such as ""Look for simple abstractions"", ""Reduce coupling - minimize interactions between classes"", and ""Usually, the destructor in a public base class should be virtual"". Substantial amounts of code listings appear in the book (approximately 20% of the pages)."
2,a bit stilted,"history reads as if it were written for Scotchmen exclusively. Not enough bio data on figures that are introduced so there is no grounding .....also, I never fail to marvel at how many histories invariably allude to their first settlers encountering the ""indigenous"" people. Who are these people and how did they get there? How much of what they were transferred culturally? Geography tells us much about behaviour but is rarely considered when compiling pre-histories."
5,"As a Scottish-American, I found this illuminating","Obviously this is a vanity read for me. I love to learn more about the roots of Scottish civilization. This book is quite a love-letter to the land of St. Andrew and the Dragon. If you have an interest in the timeline from the early formation of the kingdom competing with the British Crown through modernity, this is an excellent read. A great deal of it discusses the evolution of industry, or politics and the educational system, and the shifting sets of alliances among the various Scottish leaders and clans with the French, the British and the Spaniards. A recommended read."
3,Pretty Good,"If you're looking for a concise history of Scotland, this is it. Be prepared to read the spoken English of the writer. It can slow Americans down a bit."
3,LOUD!!,Overall this is a good toy. My one year old got it for her birthday. She loves to push the keys and watch the bears dance. The biggest drawback is that is is LOUD! There is not a volume switch.
2,The loudest toy in the house,We recieved this toy for christmas for our 1 1/2 year old. She likes it but it is so LOUD that I usually turn it off as soon as she walks away and then put it in the toy box. No volume switch. Mind you toys don't usually bother me. she has lots of things that play music. But I don't like this one very much. several months later I had a thought and I put tape over the speaker and now it is much better.
2,toy is too loud,"My 15-month old daughter likes playing with this toy, but this toy is incredibly loud. I finally had to put a piece of tape over the speaker keep it from completely driving me crazy. There is also only a few songs it plays, unlike other musical toys, so they get very annoying after awhile. I would recommend purchasing another musical toy instead."
2,Cute but boring,"My daughter got this when she was 23 months old. I think she was too old for it by then- She would occasionally push the buttons to hear a song play, but that's about it. We have other toy pianos, but she never liked this one. (By the way, there are 8 keys, but it only plays 4 different songs.) I agree with the other reviewers about the noise; it is way too loud. We put a piece of packing tape over the speaker, which brought the music volume down to a much better level."
2,Loud,My daughter received this for her 1 year birthday. I enjoy playing with it more than she does. It plays music when you hit the keys and the Care Bears dance. That's all it does! The major thing I don't like is that it is loud. This one does not have a volume switch just an on/off switch. Needless to say the switch is usually in the off position except for when I want to play with it.
2,Tedius and Monotonous,"I tried to get through this slim novel, but it was like reading a story that Basil Rathbone rejected for a movie script. Watson is a bumbler and the Irregulars are treated with more respect. No clues given along the way to aid the reader-we are just barely along for the duration."
4,i like this one....it's my favorite!!!,i never herd tha cat from neptunes on a track with royce...to me thats hot!!!!!!!!
3,LOW QUALITY,"Buy east DVD thinking that vendria with improvements of the original version of AnimeEigo but is the same did not change anything, ADV Films must take in consideraton to the people of Latin America and to put subtitles in Spanish since to put single French and English it is to discriminate against other markets, I am not pleased at all dvd this like the optimized version of Robotech, worse as or it buys volume 1 I must join them but if or they have ROBOTECH REMTERIZED VERSION dont buy this dvd..."
4,Nice for the price!,"This item functions well. It came in great shape. It is a great size for a laptop. Big enough to have the laptop and a few other items (pencil holder, stapler,...) while it is not too big. We are using it to prevent scratching the desk with the laptop. If you are planning on using it for writing and plan on having a laptop on top as well, I'd get a larger one. The gold pattern on the edges is a little cheap looking, but it is fine. It is just very traditional looking, so I wouldn't put it in your office if you are design conscious and you like a more updated look. It just looks more traditional. It is good quality, and we are happy with it!"
1,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!,"I have ordered from this company and never received my product. 5 months later and 5 e-mails to their customer service department I have neither seen my order nor have I heard from their customer service department, despite the fact that THEY CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD ALREADY. Beware of ordering anything made by this company."
1,Pathetic Aerobics Video,"Thank God I didn't buy this unprofessional and repetitive exercise video. (I rent them to review, then decide whether or not to buy.) Whoever shot this video was clueless. Her legs are cut off at the knees so you can't see how her feet move and the rest of the class is so bunched together, it's difficult to see what they're doing. You also barely work up a sweat. As for energy, lethargic is a better word. I see more energy in senior fitness classes at the gym. Do not waste your time or money on this video. It deserves 0 stars, but the form doesn't allow it."
4,good dancing,i think she did a good job with this video she showed good dance moves and i think she has alot of talent
4,If you buy a single book on WinCE this should be it.,"Very good coverage of shortcuts, databases, registry, etc. Plenty of info for the beginner and intermediate, some for the advanced. I believe this book contains the quickest route to get from CE beginner to advanced.I've bought all of my books based mainly on others reviews. This book firmly reinforced my policy.Thank you to all those who came before me..."
1,Don't expect too much from this book,"I always buy the books on Amazon.com, because the review's are very helpfull. I only buy the book after reviewing it. But this time the reviews mislead me. If you had bought ""Inside"" books from Microsoft Press for example, Inside ODBC, Inside COM, Inside OLE don't even compare these books with Inside Microsoft Windows CE. Those books are GEMS, TOP OF THE LINE. This book is like a story book. Lack of indepth technical stuff.These days I am starting to learn PDA stuff. I expected this book to be some thing like Palm OS Companion guide which explains every thing about the OS. Even after paying for the book (Palm OS Companion is free) I am not satisfied. I did not get my money's worth. Bottom line is don't buy this book if you are interested in the Insides of Windows CE OS (as this book suggets)."
2,Misleading Title But Interesting Read,"This book should have been called ""The Making of WinCE"" or some such. It helps the reader attain a better understanding of the WinCE Gestalt, what winCE is, how it got there, and where it's going. It is not good as a reference or programmers book."
4,visionaryprophetdaniel,"Jaimie Sams has created a workable system to do readings for Native Americans full-blooded or ""half-breed"" [no slur intended]. The cards seem to depict the Plains Native Americans.I see no harm in trying divine answers for those who seek the truth within themselves. I like the book and cards for the directness and simplicity in getting answers with this book/deck set...."
1,ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS FRAUDS IVE EVER SEEN,"Just how gullible would you have to be to fall for this offensive nonsense? Tarot cards are from EUROPE people, and Samms is not even an Indian. ... She is NOT an elder and is NOT recognized or respected by ANY tribe or Native people.Spare me the silly excuses: ""She's recommended by Twyla Nitsch."" ...""But they work for me."" It's called the Placebo Effect. A sugar pill would work just as well and not be so incredibly offensive and not LIE about Native people and our beliefs.File this book under ""FANTASY for Gullible ... People With Too Much Time and Money on their Hands, and Afraid to do the Real Work Necessary to Solve Their Own Problems."" ..."
5,Essential in understanding position of Tibet/China/USA today,"As one who knows the author, has visited Tibet, and was involved in the fringes of the operations, I can only say that Ken Knaus has given us the background we need to understand the situation as it exists in Tibet today and the role USA/CIA played in it. A Must Read book."
1,Naive Readers Beware!,"Unlike previous reviewers, I'm not going to drag on my comments for long, indulging in senseless blabber. In one sentence, while they are telling you yiddi yiddi yadda, I'm saying to you that this book belongs not on the shelf, but in the refuse dump."
5,great beginner's book,"If you were afraid to try to cross stitch before, this is the book for you. A wonderful book to get you started. Everything is covered-how to begin-how to end- and what to do in between. The only beginners book you will need."
4,Buy it for the extra feature,"The main movie is a bit lacking in content and quite dated.Just when i was going to take a break at what i thought might have been the halfway point, the main movie was over. I recommend it if you want to see a dry classic, but not if you're looking for information further than the various nature channels would provide.***However, the added feature show was quite informative and well done, which redeemed the excitement that i originally had before viewing the main feature."
1,Not grammar or spelling,"This book was a complete waste of money. The activities are silly busy work; they involve no instruction or learning. There are no lessons of any kind. Examples of activiities include: Write a sentence that uses every letter in the alphabet or Invent 5 words by spelling common words backwards to mean their opposites. Another gem is: Calculate how many scrabble points you would get for spelling your own name then think of as many words as you can that have the same point value as your name.If you just want cutesy activities, the book may be of some use. For every 20 worthless activities there may be one activity that relates to grammar or spelling (1.e. Rewrite the following sentences so the pronouns relate to the antecedent). As a whole, the book is definitely not worth the money for me!"
5,A Fantastic Song,"James Blunt had a phenomenal success with his stunning first-ever single ""You're Beautiful"" taken from his debut album ""Back To Bedlam"" and though the other songs fall pretty short of rhythm of that wondrous melodious track,""Wisemen"" does provoke a sense of enchantment in the listener's soul. This song is different from the love-driven ""You're Beautiful"" and has a philosophical accent about it. What's remarkable about this song is the stength with which James Blunt sings it coupled with its powerful meaning. Indeed it's always an eternal reason of awe to think that this was a man who was actually in the British army before turning into a male solo vocalist but after listening to his songs featured in ""Back To Bedlam"",you get a queer feeling that James Blunt would make it really big in the realm of pop music."
2,Great guitar but PLEASE stop singing!!!,"Pete is one of my favorite guitar players and his licks are intact on this release. But why, oh why, do guitar players have to try and sing. Pete is no vocalist and it is almost painful to hear his flat voice over such cool playing. I can't really recommend this CD for that reason. I guess I will just stick to Dwight Yoakam for Pete's playing, great songs and a great vocal."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzz,More drivel from Ralph. How anyone can get off on this boggles my mind.This is music for the Starbucks generation.
3,no so shiney,"I bought this item to go with my pink kitchen, This item would be great except it it almost impossible to keep the shine it. It whistles really loud, I love it. The pink part on the handle is a rubber material and if you get any thing on it it does stain. this item would be great for decor but not practicle for use if you want it to stay shiney and pink."
4,good quality,very nice tea kettle. a pain to get the spout open to pour but just a matter of getting used to it.
5,perfect!,"I love this kettle. It works great and has a nice, loud whistle. I read a review that the spout leaked while warming, but if you don't overfill it, you shouldn't have a problem. I've purchased a second for my in-laws."
3,flawed buy fixable,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS. SHE WENT TO WASH IT, AND FOUND IT PITTED AND DISCOLORED. AMAZON MADE IT EASY TO RETURN. COULDN'T ASK FOR BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE."
2,Loved it for the first month.,"I LOVED this kettle. It's beautiful, well designed and has a great whistle. Unfortunately after a month or so of use I started noticing small areas of rust inside the kettle. After looking at reviews of this kettle online, I found out that this is a fairly common problem."
1,"Rubber melts, porcelain cracks, handle is hot","We had this kettle for around a year. The rubber pieces melted within the first month, you needed an oven mit to lift it after heating because the handle was the same temp as the rest of the kettle, and recently the porcelain cracked and broke while we were heating water. Do not buy this kettle."
5,bought it for a great cause,I have never used this teakettle but it is a great addition to my other pink products in my kitchen. It looks great!
4,Well made,"It arrived promptly. The tool is smaller than a standard pulaski, but it gets the job done. Fortunately I purchased it for light use around the yard and not for heavy clearing."
2,Little Tikes Endless Adventure Jr. Slide,"I purchased this slide for my niece who turned 2 years old last month. I was really impressed at how quickly it arrived at her home however, once we open the slide to put it together there were scratches all over it and it was really dusty. It was almost like someone else had used it, didn't like it, and returned it. We washed it down however, that didn't help the fact that it was damaged."
2,Returned two of these,"There are three issues with this product. 1) The brace that keeps the slide in an open position is just about impossible to connect. I was afraid I was going to break it trying to get it in place. 2) The slide comes with no packing materials, so it slides around and gets very scuffed. 3) The box mentioned instructions included--both slides I received had no instructions.I will give Amazon 5 stars for their ease of replacing and returning products, though. It was a breeze.I purchased the Step 2 jr slide from Toys R Us and, while you need to be a mechanical engineer to put it together, it is of a much better quality."
4,Great LITTLE slide,"This is a great beginner slide, perfect for smaller toddlers. The age recommendation on this says 1 1/2 to 4 years. I can't see a 4 year old using this slide, as it's very small. My son is 2, he's tall though (wears 3T clothes) and his feet touch the ground before he's 1/2 way down the slide. He still loves it though. It's the perfect height for the little ones, so even when they fall off it's not too high off the ground to really hurt them. Even if he's a little too tall for it, my little boy will spend an hour sliding away on it!"
2,Somewhat of a design flaw. . .,"Bought this for my 17 month old-- so the problem is that there's not really a platform at the top. She goes right up the steps, then can't seem to get her foot hoisted over onto the slide part. i.e. there needs to be a flat part at the top that she is able to stand on, then sit, then slide. She's now 20 months and can finally sort of maneuver it. . . but it's not that fun and she doesn't use it that much. My 3 year old can do it fine. . . but it's too ""baby"" for him, to use his words. It is durable and folds well, so those things are true."
5,Little Tykes Slide,I purchased the slide for my little grandson for Christmas. It is very durable and easy to climb. He LOVES it! We all had a great time watching him enjoy his new toy.
5,Fun!,"My 1 yr old loves this! I don't think it is unsafe as long as the parents are nearby. We always play together on this, indoors and out."
1,Terrible toy for kids-- Endless Adventures Play Slide,"My son is big for his age, I admit that, but he's not so big that he's outgrown this slide, which is recommended for 1 1/2 to 4 years of age. When we bought this, it was poorly assembled and it wouldn't even stand up straight because it wobbled horribly! I'm not abouttttt to let my son climb on something that's just going to topple over on top of him. Also, there is no room at the top for him to sit before sliding down the mountain of a slide, not to mention NOTHING to hold on to for support on his downhill race. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone-- buyers beware!!!"
1,TOO STEEP - Convex slide,"This slide is poorly designed. Instead of a scoop where it's steep up top, and flat at the bottom, it's like falling off the top of a circle, where you go faster and faster until -wham- your bottom hits the ground. After my two year old got several ""boo-boos"" on her bum from slamming into the ground, we tossed it out and ordered something else. Do yourself and your kid a favor: get a different slide."
3,Not as fun as you'd think,"This is a nice durable slide, but my daughter has a hard time climbing it because there's nothing to hang onto at the top. Therefore, she's lost interest in it. I think once she's older, she may go back to it, but by then, we'll have something bigger and better, I'm sure. Right now, it's sitting outside on the patio collecting rain, dirt and dust."
3,It's too expensive for such a cheap toy,I recieved this slide for my 2 yr old the other day and it had scratches all over the slide and looked banged up alittle..on the side of that it's actually made alittle too cheap and it isn't really long enough for them to slide down and the stairs on it doesn't come out far enough for their lil feet to get a good grip..i think it's price doesn't match it's quality. I'd say maybe $29 would've been what it's really worth in my opinion but everyone is different.The only thing i rate it good on is it can be put away very easily and fits right into a closet so no clutter what so ever with it.
4,little tikes slide,My daughter was 15 mos when I got this for her. She hasn't really played with it much because of other toys she has. She is able to climb the steps and slide down. Little tikes company always has great stuff!
5,great indoor/outdoor slide,This slide is great for indoors and outdoors when weather permits. It folds compact in order to store in a closet and is lightweight enough to carry with one hand and the toddler in another! My grandson insists to bring it with him when he visits! He's two and it's perfect for him.
3,"CLAUDE MILLER, OPUS 14","*** 2007. Based on Philippe Grimbert'sSecret, written and directed by Claude Miller. A César award (Julie Depardieu) and 10 other nominations. Franois Grimbert remembers his childhood spent among a French Jewish family. He'll discover a secret the whole family hushed up for years. A SECRET is a good movie with good actors about a good topic. The problem is that a hundred TV movies could be described in such a way. If you ask a little more from the seventh art, it's clearly not enough. Already forgotten."
5,"Jiffy 10"" Blade Protector",Great quality and was the cheapest on the internet. Product shipped very fast and fit my ice auger like a glove.
4,An Amazing Man,"John Brown, one of the most influential and important people of his time and of ours is captured by soul in this book. He is my great great great great great grandfather, which i know sounds a little off-the-wall, but even though he is so far down the line, i am still very proud of it. Keep his story alive, this man deserves appreciation."
1,Very low quality,"I purchased this saxophone maintenance kit by Herco, and when it came in I read the instructions. It seemed pretty straight-forward, but when I went to use the swabs that you run through the neck piece and the horn body, they both snapped of inside the horn, even under very gently pressure. It took me several minutes to clear out my horn. The cork grease was ok, but I'm not even going to try to put the key oil on my horn, because everything else is of such low quality. While I do use the mouthpiece brush, that is it. I cannot recommend this to anyone."
4,The Nonesuch,"Really enjoyed this one! Her usual high standard!Great characters, great dialogue. Georgetter Heyer writes so well I miss her characters when I've finished reading the book."
4,Works great!,We purchased this to keep the kids entertained on long trips and that's exactly what it does! The headsets are a blessing and the picture is great (and the adjustability works well). Easily placed on a lap or attaches to the vehicle's headrest. For the money I don't think you'll find a better product!
4,Good Value,"We bought this DVD player to keep our 2 year old happy in the car on a few long trips we have coming up. It is a great value for the money and so far so good. I love the carrying case and the fact that it easily installs on the back of our carseat. We haven't really used the battery yet, just the AC and car adapter.Before the movie starts the DVD turning inside the player is LOUD but you don't hear it once the movie starts playing."
2,Not very pleased,"Have owned this DVD player for only a month or two and have run into several problems already. It will not play a disc smoothly. It kind of freezes the frame every few seconds; the sound seems normal however. Also, when the battery gets low, the screen gets bars across it and it makes a loud humming sound. The fact that it came with a case and earphones was what attracted me the most to this model. However, if I could do it again, I would pick a differnet machine and buy the extras separately."
1,Not Recommended - Lasts Warranty Period only.,"Well, as is the trend with many modern consumer devices this is one manufactured to fail just outside the warranty period.Purchased: October 9, 2007It worked fine for the first 90 days without any issue. About mid/late February it started skipping and having issues reading discs.Died: March 29, 2008It no longer reads any disc. It will either spin for several minutes then say No Disc, or immediately return with that error. Lens verified as clear, discs have no scratches and working in other systems.Not Recommended."
4,Lasted forever,"Amazon wanted me to rate something I bought years ago - little creepy they keep such good track. This thing has been around the world, jammed into suitcases, backpacks, cars, etc and lasted."
4,Still working,"We bought this a while ago for my son.It still works, even though my kids are a little harder on toys that most kids.We still take it on long car rides.They love it.It was a great deal for the money."
3,Doesn't work conveniently,"I bought this and it looks like everything we need, it has a case and all the in car connections. However, one really annoying feature is that it has to restart everytime I stop the car. So my daughter watches her videos from the beginning every time, you can't start where you left off. Also, you have to be right in front of the video player to get the remote to work. That takes away from the need to have a remote if you can't use it when you can't touch the buttons. Also, I'm not quite sure the battery is working. We turn off the player when we stop the car and after just a couple of days I can't start it when the car isn't running so the battery doesn't seem to be holding a charge - not sure what's going on with it. Finally, the bag that came with it won't fit around my headrest (I have a Honda Pilot) and it the other straps won't undo and they don't stretch enough to fit around the seat. You also can't hang it between two bucket type seats."
4,Great value,We are very satisfied with the value and quality of this DVD package. It has all you need for a trip on the road. Perfect for little kids and long car rides. Very good quality and value.
4,good for the grandkids,"I bought 2 of these for Christmas presents for my grandkids (7 and 5). They work well and pleased with all the accessories (extra headphones, chargers,etc). Excellent buy for the price."
4,Makes Long Car Trips Bearable,"My kids love this. We use it when traveling and they enjoy it immensely. It keeps them entertained for hours. The battery life is a little on the low side, but perfectly acceptable."
