2,A square dissapointment,"Square is the best rpg company out but unfortunately with all good games there's gotta be some bad. The game has good graphics but the game play is awful. RPG's are not about the graphics (Final Fantasy II, III, etc.) there about the game play. If you are looking for a final fantasy, suikoden, wild arms type of game then I do not recommend this. You might like this a bit more if you like the saga frontier series but I still doubt it. Definately rent this or download some previews before buying!"
1,Sony PS2 game,"I ordered this game for my collection. The ad was very accurate. The game was shipped quickly & safely. I would purchase from them again. The only negative thing I have to say is about the game itself. Square Enix, who up till now, I held in high esteem for their RPG games. I am afraid they published a stinker of a game!"
1,Confusing,"This game is a very rushed feel to it, the game seems incomplete and has many good idea's but many things are done in this game with little or no good reason. The map is set up in the format of a board game you must explore. In doing so you can lose the game simply because the board decides to take and scatter your characters dividing them and making it hard to complete simple tasks like killing enemies. Your weapons and gear take damage in this game and over time break. Broken gear is worthless, you also have Hps and life points and if you take to much damage to your life points from taking to much damage from your Hps you end up with game over. This game lacked a lot of polish. And I honestly have to say its darn close to unplayable. I would also have to say it's one of the worse games ever made by Squre Enix, and considering I own most of there games that's saying a lot."
1,don't wast your money,"this is by far the worst game i've ever played, it isn't worthy of a square-enix title, it's nothing compared to final fantasy x if you want a new rpg i sugest final fantasy x or x-2"
1,worst rpg ever,"Don't bother to know what it is. I bought it at around $10. Worst than the Final Fantasy's series. Worst than the Dark Cloud series. Worst than the Star Ocean's series. ""Something"" that should have never seen the light. Not even worth 1 star (but is required to put at least 1)."
1,unlimited saga,"I had the displeasure of buying this game on the first day it came out. I thought to myself Square-Enix doing a rpg, I can't go wrong. Needless to say, after playing for thirty minutes I was in a for a rude awakening. The graphics were horrible, mainly due to your characters looking more like comic strip characters with ridiculous text bubbles coming out of their mouths. When your character left a town, you weren' t actually walking--it was more like moving a chess piece across a gameboard. The combat system was just horrible, you have to spin a wheel to execute an action. The whole game looked like something they had just thrown together. I think they were aiming to do something that would be different, but it just ended up as a mess. I advise you to not waste your time with one of the worst games I have had the misfortune to purchase. So I did not think the game even warranted 1 star!"
4,Interesting story... incredibly hard game,"The stories are good, the graphics are well... different. After plaing something like Final Fantasy X it is sort of like going back to Final Fantasy VIII in battle tactics. The battle scenes are plain and there are practically no chances to heal. Only a game for the true hard-core gamer. I hope Squaresoft comes out with a strategy guide soon, because I'm going no where in the game until I get one."
2,Goin' old school on us..,"This is more or less a pen and paper RPG put into a video game, what my friend who loves the stuff told me.I unfortunately despise those, so when I bought the game I found myself being disappointed. I have a feeling a lot of other people will despise the game as well.The battle system is well thought out, and when I learned it was extremely fun. It is very frustrating to get use to it though, and takes a lot of patience (and deaths.)So, if you are thinking about buying because Square made FF, DON""T!!!!!!! but if you do like the pen and paper stuff, you probably already have this."
4,Wow....,"This game is great, but only if you are a old-school RPG fan. Its not final-fantasy, thats true but am i missing the fact that final-fantasy does not apear anywhere in the title of UNLIMITED SAGA...? didn't think so. this game is much more akin to saga frontier and its sequal both great games in my opinion if you check this out and like it i suggest the previous two games. thanks"
2,Not the best game,"When I played this game, I liked when it started it with introducing the characters and stuff and I liked the FFX-2 preview. But this game is boring. You use the analog stick to point which direction to go to, its like a boring monopoly game. The music is not the best I've heard before. Make sure you rent it first before buying it."
1,Do not make that same mistake.,I have been a long fan of RPG and this one is a throw back to the early 80's. The cinima graphics are great. To bad the actual game graphics were not the same. You don't even get to move your character around. You jump from block to block. I have game boy games that are better than this. I have only played 1 hour's worth of the game and I am going today to trade it back in today. Do not make that same mistake.
3,Unlimited Saga,"Unlimited Saga looks great, well its not. The battle system kicks cause its ezier to do combos which makes it more fun. What bummed me out was the fact that to get around you are a like stone figure thing and u pick where you want to go. If something in the area your in, it just like appears. And for trapsa nd stuff like chests u ahve a stuppid like slot machine to see if u dodge the trap or open a trap. Borrow this game you'll get bored quick"
4,Huh?,"When you first start playing, two things will enter your head 1) What's up with the...graphics? and 2) Hu-du wha???1) Pretty soon you won't notice the graphics because you'll be too occupied trying to stay alive2) I know, the game is extremely confusing! Don't worry though, after you read some stuff... you'll understand better, plus after you practice you'll learn to love the system of the game.Stick with it, and the game will become unbelievably fun!"
5,Lifesaver!,"Having had probably 8 cat books, this is a keeper. It may have saved the life of my beautiful Tortie-Tabby. At the age of 11, she had a Petit Mal seizure and miraculously it was described abundantly in the book. I took her right in and rec'd some Rx that I gave her for several months. Gradually, her seizures diminished and she has lost her fear of them and has smoother reactions.I've referred to this book dozens or hundreds of times. I totally love it."
3,MUST CHECK BEFORE USE-NOT ALL SETS FIT TOGETHER,"I bought this set last minute before my Granddaughter's birthday because she saw it online & ""just had to have this"". I paid the express shipping to be sure I had it but had a major disappointment on receipt. I could not even get all the clips on the sides due to the way the ends were bend outward and when I did get it together best as it would allow I had big open areas that would allow the batter to run right out. So much for express shipping to save time of running around locally to find this--I had to run to the neareast craft shop to buy one anyway as I could not use this one. I made the clerk take it out of the box at the store and we checked the other one and that was fine. The pan was very easy to use once I had one that was not defective and the cake baked up beautifully. My Granddaughter loved it! Needless to say the defective one went back."
4,Love this versatile pan!,I actually ordered this to make it into the baby in a diaper for my daughter's shower - worked AWESOME!
3,Product issue,"This came quickly from the seller!! The only complaint I have is that I have purchased these 3D pans before, at the stores, but this one is not very well made, almost like it was not molded correctly. The metal was bent and I had to rig it during cooking so that all the cake mix did not fall out. If someone isn't an everyday cake maker they may not know what to do to make it work..."
1,I spent how much on this piece of junk?,"Putting it together before doing anything you can see this doesn't even come close to lining up. Spent over an hour with some tools trying to straighten this thing out. It wouldn't pass the water test. Tried a cake that ended up in a total disaster. tried to seal it up with duct tape and use it as a giant jello mold, even with all my work and duct tape, clasps... still leaked. Biggest waste of money I have ever spent."
1,Waste of time,"I agree with all the negative things other reviewers have said about this book...interesting premise not executed well. A bunch of women who have nothing better to do but hang out in a knitting shop all day? Please. A white man who discovers that his grandfather was black and now must deal with the fact that he is an ""African American""? Again, please. And the baby in question, of course, is fantastically beautiful with ""golden"" eyelids, etc. The people are one-dimensional and there are too many plot lines that are left hanging at the end. A really good novel about this topic would have been a treat. This is a throwaway beach read at best."
4,Wonderful Plot,"If nothing else, this is a wonderful plot. Unlike many of the reviewers, I very much enjoyed this book. It follows a white family giving birth to a child with African-American features. I believe the reactions throughout the novel were very real and made for an interesting novel. After beginning the book, I found it hard to put down."
5,Great Story,Such a great premise: What if everything you thought you knew about your family was a lie? Sometimes family secrets come down through DNA to reveal its truth. I loved this novel. The situations are real and the reactions of the characters are true-to-form. It got wordy after the birth of the baby but Delinsky redeems herself quickly and the mysteries come to a very believable end. I'm looking forward to reading more by this author.
2,Unlikeable Characters,"To me the book seemed unrealistic. Good premise, but I had a hard time liking any of the characers. The knitting theme throughout the book drove me crazy. I was dissapointed."
5,ANOTHER GOOD READ !!!!,Have been a fan for many years. A good story that ended much too quickly.Wished more was written about Earl. Too many unresolved issues.
5,A wonderful read,"I loved this book, and so did all the people I loaned it too as well. It was heartwarming, suspensful and a fast read. Would reccomend it to anyone to read."
1,Minus two stars,"This book was written with a truly unlikely premise. It's about families who are shocked that there's mixed blood among them. Gimme a break, humans haven't been around for thousands of years without mating with ""other"" paramours. People next door, people in another tribe etc.And for you religious nuts, we're all related anyway, aren't we? The Adam and Eve story comes to mind. So then, why the shock, nobody can be pure anything.I was surprised to see some good reviews for this book. Surely you jest."
5,Mixed Heritage,"""Family Tree"" by Barbara Delinsky delves into the secret heritage of a proud New England family when a baby is born with distinct African features. Dana Clarke has never known her father, in the beginning she and her husband suspect the unknown as the racial factor. Hugh Clarke is driven to prove his child to his family, who will not accept a mixed race child and her mother. Dana sees his act of DNA testing as a betrayal of their relationship.Research though closed doors and family secrets uncovers many surprising factors in the lives of both sets of their parents. This story of the blending of racial boundaries across generations is told with grace and style.Nothing is a it seems, which keeps the reader turning the pages as love and trust must be regained before the young couple and their lovely daughter can move on to become another generation on the family tree.Nash Black, author of ""Qualifying Laps,"" ""Sins of the Fathers,"" and ""Taxes, Stumbling Blocks & Pitfalls for Authors 2007."""
1,Total Rip Off,"Normally I love this author's novels but, quite frankly and in my opinion, this book is a rip off of a short story written by Kate Chopin in 1892 called ""Desiree's Baby."" I am amazed that the author did not have to give some sort of credit to this author by saying, ""Inspired by the work of Kate Chopin,"" or some such. I personally will not be reading any more of Ms. Delinsky's books. I have no problem with an author telling someone's story in a different way, but please give credit where credit is due. Would have given zero stars, but not an option."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I'm only midway into this book but felt compelled to see what others thought of this book. So far it's a disappointment but unlike others who were disappointed in Hugh, I'm more disappointed in Dana who is just not to be believed. Actually everyone in this novel is ""unreal."" The idea of this book was interesting but Delinsky just does not pull it off. The characters as someone else mentioned are not to be believed at all and yes, why are the characters who have the means to get answers dragging their feet and being so wishy washy. I'm a fan of Delinsky but she fails miserably in this effort. Nothing is believable about this book."
3,"Interesting premise, solid execution","Delinsky presented a very solid novel here. Rather than a straight romance novel, this was rather reminiscent of a Jodi Picoult novel - and it would probably make a very entertaining adaptation into a Lifetime Movie Channel movie. Yes, it was definitely a bit predictable. But despite the familiarity of the plot, the book as a whole was entertaining and an interesting look into race relations on the East Coast. The plausibility was a little questionable though.... I suppose it could happen... And though Delinsky offered a lot of support, the general premise still felt rather unlikely."
2,Beach Read,"Read it at the beach and leave it there for the next chickadee who's had too many mojitos.It's thin (to be kind), predictable, feel good and been done.When the half African American child chose two dolls for herself, one dark skinned and the other light skinned I wondered if I wasn't reading a book meant for my 9 year old daughter.Ugh. Chick lit.And not even the good kind."
1,Can I give it zero stars?,"The premise was interesting enough but the execution was painful. The characters were so contrived and the dialog so pedantic and heavy handed and false. ""Did you know that it can be Difficult To Be Black Or Otherwise Different In the United States?"" I mean, the level of condescension was unbearable. How stupid can these people be? Also, what's with the characters who suddenly decide they are ""African American"" because one ancestor was black and then they have to rethink their whole identity. They grew up feeling white, they don't have one single issue that African Americans have to cope with. Face it, just about every single one of us grows up with various ethnicities in our history, whether we know it or not, and it doesn't change your identity, it's part of who you are. I hated these people.Also, like another reviewer, the knitting plot bugged."
2,I didn't particularly like this book,"I found the basic idea of this story as interesting and I was excited to read a story that dealt with racial equality, etc. However, I felt that the story was a little too far fetched and so many of the situations did not seem realistic or plausible at all. Also, during the short span of time that this story took place pretty much every character was having a pretty significant life revelation, discovery, exposure, etc. etc. I know the author was just trying to bring home the point of the book, but for me it was so extreme that it was not believable at all. There seemed to be many long dialogue passages between the different characters that said the same things over and over again. I wasn't really excited about this book, and the characters just did not grab me. I did appreciate the main idea of racial equality and thought about the things the characters said. This is my first book by this author."
3,Lesson learned within the first few chapters,"Definitely an easy read, this was a good weekend book. Thought provoking; not exactly. Delinsky paints an improbably scenario in which a very, very caucasian couple gives birth to a dark (a.k.a. black baby)and the effect this has on all aspects of the family. While the characters were relatable enough, the theme was presented in an over-obvious way and while it may lead the reader to ponder the question of race and our deepest predjudices, I felt like I was being hit over the head again and again with the demand to think about how we are all selectively predjudice. OK, I get it. Additionally, certain aspects of the book tied way too neatly together in the end and certain characters and scenarios were definitely unecessary to prove the overall point. This was an enjoyable read as a whole and quick to get through but I wouldn't say I'm a better person for having read it."
4,Pleasant reading,"I recommend this book. Ms. Delinsky is a good writer - the dialogue was authentic - and I was caught up in the family drama. We are compelled to think about what might be hidden in our own family tree and the devastation of keeping secrets from those we love. The element of knitting in this book makes it of interest to knitters but the story stands well on its own. When the main character worked on her knitting, I itched to get to my own projects. However, I didn't want to put the book down and read it quickly to know how it all turned out. This book was a delight, and by the end, I wanted to own my own yarn shop."
2,Family tree,What happened to the lady and the senator. You just forgot all about them ....it would have been nice to no that the little boy was taken care of.
3,Pretty good,"This book was not quite what I expected it to be but I enjoyed it anyway. As a woman who is thinking about soon having children, I found it very interesting. It makes you think about what you would do in similar circumstances."
3,Family Tree,"Very good fast no thinking required reading. The ending of the story was all too predictable but a good ""beach read"" fast and no thought required"
1,Not for me,Ugh. I very rarely give up on a book but I gave up on this one. Just couldn't get into it. The premise sounded interesting but something about the author's style of writing really turned me off. No thanks.
3,Beach Read,"This is a good book for the beach or for whenever some easy-to-read material is called for. I agree that there were many unresolved issues and unecessary side plots in this story, whose ""twist"" I guessed in the first 25 pages."
1,Really contrived,"This novel was like a Danielle Steele novel without the ""romance."" Completely contrived plot line, characters who don't seem real, and a complete disconnect between the premise and the follow through. This book was completely dull."
2,"Too bland, but the knitting part was good....","I guess I was hard up for something to read when I chose this one. Definitely chick lit.: gorgeous heroine and handsome hero surmount racial obstacles together, all the while seeing everything through rose-colored glasses and a haze of character that doesn't exist under the Bush administration. Well, at least she got something right about the knitting culture: They DO talk about you in knitting stores if you don't buy the expensive yarn. You could be doing geek knitting so complicated that it takes a 160 I.Q. and pages of graph paper to figure it out, but if you're not using horrendously expensive natural fiber, you WILL be denigrated. I would rather have seen that angle developed."
5,Family History Mystery,"Excellent book by Barbara Delinsky. Loved the story line. If you're into Family History, you'll love this book."
1,Lollipop Girl surprise,"Well, i got this Lollipop Girl, Cassie from California doll as a gift from my auntie. She knows how much i like dolls, so she got me this one as a birthday surprise. And surprised i was!I opened the wrapped gift and looked at her in astonishment..This is the ugliest doll i have ever seen!Cassie has a very ugly face and tacky clothes. Her boots go way high up and it overall sux. Cassie from California lollipop girl is terrible! I would suggest winx over this, if you want the same style of doll."
3,ST Oversized Communicator devise,The batteries had leaked so I had to do extensive cleaning to get the devise to work. It is now operational.
3,"If it smells like fish, go with the beef","It doesn't seem to work, even after i replaced the batteries, there is a lot of corrosion on the battery terminals, so that might be it, but other than that, it's a fine edition to any Trekkie wardrobe."
4,Excellent,"I've been looking for a more intimate showing of Jimi Hendrix's talent. This is just what I was looking for. He was an excellent blues guitarist.The recording is just a bit echoing. But overall, I love it."
2,A stupid release,"At a shop this CD looked cool, but when I tried it at home, I discovered that many of songs were instrumental jams or unfinished takes.Some tracks are good: Hear My Train A Comin' (both versions), Catfish Blues, and Bleeding Heart. Other tracks are either not-so-interesting jams, or even unfinished takes.Instead of putting this kind of stuff on CDs, copyright owners could distribute these studio jams and unfinished takes freely in the Internet. This is now just money making thing.If you're Hendrix fan, then borrow this CD from your friend and buy something else."
2,Hendrixblues,"If you love Hendrix and his style, buy this CD, but if you just love the Traditional style blues, don't buy this. Has a couple good songs, but to me the recording sounds bad overall.Tucky"
2,"BLUES?....DON'T THINK SO, JIMI BOY","I'M A BLUES MUSICIAN AND FROM THAT STANDPOINT I MUST SAY THAT THIS NOT..I REPEAT...NOT...A BLUES CD. JIMI HENDRIX WAS A GREAT AND UNIQUE 60'S FLOWER GENERATION MUSICIAN. HE WAS NEVER A BLUESMAN. IF YOU DOUBT ME, CHECK OUT ""MANNISH BOY"". THE ONLY TRACK I WOULD CONSIDER BLUES IS ""HEAR MY TRAIN A COMIN'"" (ACOUSTIC). IT'S ALL HIS BRAND OF 60'S FLOWER-ACID JAM MUSIC AFTER THAT. THE CD COVER IS ALSO VERY MISLEADING. THERE ARE OVER 28 PHOTOS OF BLUESMEN ON IT....WHEN, IN REALITY, ONLY ONE OF THOSE ARTIST'S...MUDDY WATERS...SONGS ARE ON THIS CD. I LIKE HENDRIX...I HAVE ""VOODOO CHILE"" AND I DIG IT....BUT, FOR REAL, HE AIN'T...I REPEAT...AIN'T...NO BLUESMAN. I BOUGHT THIS CD BECAUSE OF THE PHOTOS AND TITLE. TRUE BLUES FANS....BE AWARE!! JERSEY SLIM"
4,Good Music,"ONly ONe Disc contains music the other disc is just a menu theme, the advertisement appears to be double disc."
4,A Nice Addition,"There's really some great music, on this album. If you love the electric blues, you really need to get this, as it's full to bursting, at a whopping 72 minutes, with soulful, wailing, mind-blowing blues. Alternate versions and outtakes dominate the disc, so if you've got Jimi's standard studio stuff, this is still worth owning. Less production and more feeling is what you'll find here. Great stuff, and I find that I listen to this more than both Are You Experienced? and Axis: Bold as Love, and almost as much as the magnificent Electric Ladyland."
2,Heldrix blues review,These songs came out prior to his death in 1969. A person would think that the sound quality of these songs would have been better..
3,the good & the bad,"I bought this as a much anticipated gift for my husband. He loved it! Said it lived up to the reviews, breaking down solos with speed control to really learn every note. The only drawback is that the DVD does NOT play in any of our DVD players. We tried 3 different players & the PS3, but the only thing that will play the DVD is the laptop. It was disappointing and really limits the viewing."
5,The best blues guitarman!,Jimi always played blues like no other!This album is a historical moment that links all the influences of the blues to the roots of rock'n roll!Jimi payed a specially sentimental tribute to the genre that he loved so! It's to be at any honest blues collection!
3,Jimi Hendrix,"I came across this album while surfing the web. I had never heard of it before, even though I was quite familiar with Jimi's body of work. I was glad to find it at Amazon, especially since noone else I tried seemed to have it.Overall, I was quite pleased. I love to listen to the blues, and I always liked Jimi on guitar. He did nothing to disappoint me here, and I'm sorry I didnt know about this album decades ago. I was somewhat dismayed, however by his ninr minute plus jam titled ""Born Under a Bad Sign"" which had no vocal, and little, if any, of the melody of the song."
3,Hendrix played the blues!,These are all taken from jam sessions in the studio. Many of the songs are without vocals.. Overall sound quality is good.
4,Jimi lives !,"Yes, he's still here amongst us. I saw him in San Fransisco just the other day. This CD proves, he's not dead."
3,Not a Blues CD,"I like some of Hendrix's stuff a lot, but this is not one of his better efforts. It's certainly not a blues CD. There are some good tracks on it, but too many mediocre tracks. And lastly, it is NOT a blues CD."
5,A must have.,"I actually get chills thinking about his one. If you are a blues fan and a Hendrix fan, this CD is absolutely essential to your collection."
4,The legends are true,"I had been saying for a while that the legends of artists like Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles had surpassed their actual abilities.Everybody's been saying that Hendrix is the greatest guitarist ever for so long that it's become automatically accepted as true.Well, after hearing ""Blues,"" I'm convinced. My first real experience with Hendrix was from a tribute album, ""Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix."" That showed me there is a lot more to Jimi's music than the acid rock and Woodstock performance that he is most well-known for. After that I figured I should hear some of his original stuff. He was a student of the guitar and could do it all -- rock, R&B;, funk and as I learned on this album, blues. Tracks 6 and 9 were my favorites.Blues music was made for the guitar and the guitar was made for Jimi.Maybe I need to check out some Presley and Beatles now."
5,JIMMY & THE BLUES,THIS CD IS JUST DAMN GOOD 2 VERSIONS OF HEAR MY TRAIN COMIN' MAN! IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY TO THE NEXT CENTURY A VERY INTENSE BLUES CD FOR ANY JIMMY HENDRIX AND BLUES FAN --JIMMY HENDRIX RULES--....
5,Left Orbit Temple release one of the best debut CD's ever!,"This project seems like something of a supergroup with members of Pigface, Thrill Kill Kult, Verbow, Die Schon, and a bunch of others, however the main dude seems to be this James fella. Although the players come largely from an industrial background, the music is very ambient, mellow, and has a real authentic tribal feel to it. It does not reeally even feel like an electronic record, although clealry many synths and samplers were used. I didn't detect any snare drums on the record - it's all tribal beats. I also liked that there is a CD-ROM on the disc that has little or nothing to do with the music - it has ten artists work on it. This is a really cool concept in that all of the people on the disc - musical or visual - are reaching new audiences - sort of a big cross-pollenation of not only musical genres, but completely different forms of artistic expression as well. I love this thing!"
5,Where have you been all this time?!!!!,"This is a great CD and definetely worth trying out. Lorenzo has a great voice and can ""sang"". And no, I didn't mean ""sing"". I knew when I heard him on Oprah After the Show and he sang Donny Hathaway's ""Song for You"" after never hearing it before singing it, he had talent. It's unfortunate it took so long to discover him. I'm sure had he been exposed several years ago, he'd be a household name by now. *****"
5,New Fan of Mariachi,"I am not new to Mariachi, but the classics can't really hold my attention like the songs on this cd. This cd is a breath of fresh air to new sounds ands songs which will attract new listeners to the Sounds of Mexico.If you love Mariachi or Mexican music, you will truly love This cd."
2,calipers are challenging,"I knew that learning how to use calipers was going to be challenging, but I did my research and had a friend help me. Others had recommended this device. First problem is that the battery door (uses a watch battery) kept falling off during use. Okay, so I tape it back on to keep the battery in place. Taking caliper measurements yourself as a novice is just really hard to do. I tried explaining to my husband how to do it, and even still, wildly different readings each time.To me, its not worth the hassle and confusion. So far, I'm pretty happy using the Omron."
4,His 1st solo album- Great raw guitar.,"After 2 albums with his band Skid Row, Gary recorded ""Grinding Stone"" in 1973. This album was not that much different than the music he had done before,but it was better, more polished. It is a must for any hard-core fan. Gary is one of the best guitarists of all-time, this cd does not prove that yet; but shortly after this with Colosseum II and Thin Lizzy; Gary is on top of the heap. His style got more refined and became easier to listen to. This cd was a great start of things to come."
5,addendum,"The more I listen to this CD the more obsessed I become. It truly is an all-time classic - the music trippy & warm...the lyrics are just brilliant and very wise & kind. The album is kind of a sonic mixture of The Left Banke's THE LEFT BANKE TOO (one of the lead singers even sounds a lot like The Left Banke's George Cameron who sang lead on ""Goodbye Holly"" and ""Bryant Hotel"") and The Byrds' NOTORIOUS BYRD BROTHERS, and, of course, The Beatles. Order this right away! My favorite tracks are ""Remembering's All I Can Do"" and ""In A Kindly Way"" Both georgeous and heartbreaking."
2,Buy the original not this remake,This is a remake of Dance Hot Salsa video 3&4 & frankly it is not better.The connection between Josie & this new teacher Louie was embarrassing to watch.Josie also needs to learn that females over a certain age should go for a classy look in their outfits. Her chosen clothes were a great laugh.Other than a new count to the music this dvd offers nothing that is better than the first video. In fact Pedro Otero who was in the first make of this video was a far better dancer/ personality than this new dance partner.Overall we were left with a feeling this is a cheap remake.We do not recommend this dvd. Buy the original & ignore her counting.
5,Good Product,I bought this to control chickweed and it works very well on both chickweed and most other broadleaf weeds without harming grass. I like it a lot. It is hard to find at my local retailers which was surprising to me and the one I did find was nearly double the price I found on Amazon.
4,Works Well | Impossible to Lock Down,"I have an Oldsmobile Achieva and this rack works well. The only hangup is the fact that securing this unit to the car so it cannot be stolen doesn't seem possible. The two arms which hold the bikes are attached to the rest of the frame by quick release pins so it would be easy to release the arms and steal the bikes. For the price, this is a great product and works well. My main concern would be someone stealing the bike(s) when I'm away from the car."
2,Poor Design,"We ordered this rack to carry two adult Trek bikes and a youth mountian bike. First, there's almost no way to carry three bikes on this rack without incurring damage to the bike frames or spokes. Once could possibly partially diassemble the bikes and accomodate three bikes but that sort of defeats the purpose. Secondly, this is not a stable unit. Loaded with three bikes the rack tends to pull away from the vehicle (Toyota SUV) even with the straps conced tightly enough to flex the rack's frame. Even more troubling is the fact that the arms of the rack are secured with only two cheap spring-loaded pins which hold them into a plastic housing. On our rack, it was possible with just a little effort to jiggle and torque the arms enough to dislodge the pins. On the road that would result in the loss of all the bikes. This is a poor design ... save yourself the effort of a return."
1,Buy American!,"The Swedish makers of this rack actually pack a card in the box saying that they have no liability for damage to your vehicle or bicycles caused by their product. They don't even have a customer service number to contact them. This rack carried bikes just fine but the ""anti-sway"" bracket rubbed the paint off of my new Fuji. Now I am stuck with this damage even though the rack has been returned. Don't buy anything from Thule. Buy from someone that stands behind their products!"
5,The best car rack I've tried,"Recently decided to replace my old Rhode Gear rack (clasps were rusted). Tried the Saris Bones 3 - horrible. Returned it to the store the next day. Very difficult to get the bikes on and off. Now purchased the Thule 962XT from Eastern Mountain Sports ($104 on a 20% discount special). This is a beautiful piece of equipment. Well made, solid, easy to set up and holds three bikes very securely. The no-sway mechanism works well (this seems to be the primary upgrade from the earlier 962 version which now retails for about $105 without discount) and keeps the bikes at a slight angle away from the car. The bikes sit very firmly in place. Still need to secure the front wheels of the bikes with the supplied cynch cord (I prefer to use long pieces of velcro). Great product. A definite buy."
1,Very Bad Experiance,"The rack was sturdy, but the straps that hold the bike to the rack are horrible. My brand new bike came off of the rack while going down the highway, from hitting a very small bump in a construction area. This rack cost me $400 in bike damage the second time I used it. Luckily it didn't cause an accident and hurt someone.All that the rack has is two rubber straps that stretch over a post with wings, to secure the bike. Nothing to lock the bike down to the rack with. I even double checked that the rubber straps were fully secured over the winged posts, before leaving and read the instructions several times before ever setting it up. It seems alright for going to the local park, but would never take it on the highway again or at any speeds over 35mph."
2,thule 962xt,"Mediocre product. despite it being a ""three bike rack"" I have only figured out how to get two bikes at a time on it. A friend says if he takes off all the front wheels on his bikes he manages to get three on. If I have to dis-assemble the bikes, I can just throw the pieces in the trunk. If the bars the bikes hang on were about two inches closer together and were totally straight instead of having a bend in the last couple of inches where they go into the trunk mount part; maybe three would fit. The purchase and delivery were smooth and efficient."
4,good read,I am an avid reader of the otherworld series so I thought I would give one of Galenorn's other series' a chance and It did not disappoint. :)
3,Nice Twist at the End,"Chintz and China Series. 1st in the Series.Emerald awakes one night to find Susan Mitchell at the foot of her bed. Susan has to tell Emerald that she has been murdered by her husband. The authorities feel that it was an accidental death and now it's up to Emerald with her psychic talents and tarot cards to set the record straight.Nice twist at the end, but I could only give it a 3 because of the two ridiculous sex scenes that just didn't belong in a cozy mystery."
3,A good read...,If you like books with ghosts and the paranormal then you will truly enjoy this story. Yasmine brings a lot of knowledge of the nether world to this story as well her knowledge of tarot cards and herbs. I enjoyed this book tremendously and ate it up like a box of chocolates.
5,Murder She Wrote Meets Poltergeist!,"Single mom Emerald O'Brien gets into the holiday spirit-literally! in this engaging debut mystery by the talented Ms. Galenorn. The Pacific Northwest setting, a fresh cast of quirky characters, and the creative plot are as luscious, refreshing and satisfying as the tasty trifles Emerald serves in her Chintz `n China Tea Room. Along with the warmth and humor of a traditional ""cozy"" there are also plenty of human spills and ghostly chills along the way to keep readers on their toes, wondering what comes next---and if Emerald, her kids, and a potential new love will survive to celebrate the New Year. This is a charming and delightful tale by a talented writer, and I can't wait to read the next installment of Emerald's adventures! I am a fan."
2,eh,"I love mystery, fantasy, and a bit of romance. Honestly, this book was only so-so in all 3 categories."
2,This book is OK,"This is an OK book, but not great. Galenorn stumbles in a lot of places throughout the book and it's never clear if this is supposed to be a murder mystery or a supernatural thriller. It's too simple to be a combination of both.I give Galenorn credit for her descriptions of the supernatural elements, though -- they are quite good.I think the main problem I have with the book is that the main character is not a sympathetic one, and is actually someone who I'd never want to interact with. She has a lot of personality flaws that make it hard to care about her or what happens to her.Sex scenes in books are hard to write well. Galenorn's attempts at these come off as unintentionally funny.It did keep my interest to the end of the book -- I did want to find out how it ended."
2,Disappointing.,"I'm a big fan of paranormal romances, but this one fell flat. The main character, Emerald O'Brien, a single mother who owns a tea room and can see ghosts, SOUNDS interesting, but isn't. Her character is just too much single-Mom dealing with kids with growing pains, and not enough mystery-solving psychic. The other characters aren't well-developed or fully-formed, and I couldn't develop any real interest -- or belief -- in any of them. The Plot didn't hold my interest either. I think the author tried to do too many things in one story and, as a result, didn't do any of them very well."
2,Please don't get your hopes up,"As others mentioned, I was really looking forward to reading this series, being interested in mystery, metaphysical & romance. The characters and mystery-solving angles were very poorly developed, despite potential for them to be. I have never read a book where so much time was wasted continually talking about junk food and espresso consumption. Is the author that obsessed with food? I already bought ""Witchling,"" so I'll hope it is better!"
2,More Paranormal Than Mystery,"Not a bad story, but readers should know up front that this is a book primarily about the paranormal, and not a cozy mystery as the name of the book might lead one to believe.Also, while the author obviously wants to make points about how a divorced mother needs to approach dating, the misgivings that the protagonist has toward her suitor -- while furthering the understanding that the protagonist is a woman who always puts her kids first -- has the (I hope) unintended side effect of making the reader feel like the suitor is creepy. In a book where good and evil are so clearly delineated, it's unfortunate that one of the main characters comes off as ominous and naggingly ""there's something not right about this guy."""
4,Impressive,"Very much pleased with the condition my book came in. It's intreaguing, witty and is worth more than one read. I recommend it for anyone, you won't be wasting your time reading this book, unlike the recievers of those unfortunate letters"
3,Study guide,wanted more substance in the study guide. Many grammatical and format errors in book. Some answers to the questions were wrong in the book.
3,"Good book, but bad reprint.","The book itself is very good; unfortunately the current printing being sold is a poor quality reprint by Oxford. The pages look like xerox copies (actually my own cheap personal copier makes better quality copies than Oxford made here). As a result, many of the plates are very hard or impossible to decipher. Very disappointing for an Oxford book: For $70+ the purchaser expects much better quality.The original 1981 (uncorrected) printing (tan-colored binding) appears to be the best - the print quality of the plates is much better.The early printings of the 1991-corrected reprint (tan-colored binding with dark-blue dust jacket) appear to be okay. The plates aren't as high resolution printing as the original 1981 edition, but they're much better than the latest (dark-blue binding, no dust jacket) 1991-corrected reprint.The book itself I give 5 stars. The current reprint I give 1 star, after having the opportunity to compare it side-by-side with the two earlier printings."
5,Great piece of work!,"This book shows the beauty and love that went behind the manuscripts that the Church preserved and compiled! Although the price is quite steep for such a short read(you can finish it in one sitting!), it's a very valuable resource. Inside you will find valuable images of Biblical manuscripts, lectionaries, and a great introduction and in depth look at Greek palaeograpy. Metzger is to be commended at such a fair treatment in this book. I recommend this book for anyone interested in the Biblical manuscripts, in information as to how they came down to us, and to find out just how marvelously the early Church has preserved these deposits of our faith."
3,Design Change,"I had to return this item because there was a design change and the product no longer matches the picture. New design is nicer IMHO, but it won't fit my enclosure. See the pics on the Velleman site for the new design."
1,Don't see,"I don't see a step down transformer, does it includes one? Don't forget that in order to get 1.5V to 35V a step down transformer is needed and then a rectifier circuit"
1,Piece of Junk,"I've only owned this card for 6 months and the cooling fan just started making a loud annoying noise. That's unacceptable for a $190 card! ATI won't send me a new fan so I guess they expect me to pay $10 to send it back in for repair, leaving me with no card and costing me more than just buying a new fan. I think I'll just unplug the fan, let the card burn up and then never buy ATI products again.The other ongoing problem is that if I just have my flat screen connected with the DVI connector, after win2k boots, my screen is blank. If I hook the DVI **AND** the VGA connectors to my flat screen, it works fine and stays in digital mode--pretty annoying. It also won't properly display 1600x1200 on the VGA port--my other systems work fine at 1600x1200."
5,Excellent Card,"I dont have this card, I had a 9500 before.. this one totally blows it away, I'm a BIG gamer, so this card should and will set me up to have a more enjoyable game expereince."
3,Nice Addition to Books on Hats Collection,This small volume profiles 4 modern milliners and includes some nice photographs and little textual ditties on women's hats. A nice little book for the bathroom side table (better than those stupid joke books).
1,Not so good,"I was very excited to find this book--there isn't much literature out there for adult children of sex addicts. But this book came up very short of my expectations. I did not enjoy the religious undertones of the book, nor was it well-written (there are even typos and grammatical errors throughout). I could not relate to a lot of what the author was saying. I grew up with a sex addict but am not one myself and the healing I was looking for was just not in this book. I've found more help by reading things about addiction and trauma in general--it's too bad it does not include sex addiction more than it does."
3,Useful but severely limited,"A reference book on the chart activity of records ranked on the CD, 12"" single, and jukebox charts, video games, and videocassette sales and rentals in Cash Box Magazine. Entries include artist, title, catalog no., chart date, and week-by-week position on the chart. A section at the back shows the number one entries for each week. You won't find any information on the artists themselves, but this is worthwhile resource for record collectors, discographers, and chart fanatics. That said, the book is disappointing overall due to the scattershot selection of the charts covered (does anybody really care about the video games chart?) and the lack of coverage of some the more important charts (albums, singles - covered in the authors' other volumes through 1985 and 1981 respectively). Recommended as an addition to the Joel Whitburn Billboard books but definitely not as a substitute."
1,Poor Customer Service,Called to get a refund and they simply blew us off.Didn't want to work with us at all.DO NOT RECOMMEND.Had they just talked to us a little more or even provided a suggestion we would have been very willing to work them. Now we have this product sitting in the file collecting dust.
3,Could have been so much better.,"Review of Stark Decency purchased from Amazon.comThis was a OK book that could have been much better.The author describes the story of the German POW camp in New England. Unfortunately that is all this book is, a description of events. It is not quite as dry as just a list of events, and dates, but almost.The author had access to many interviews from his research. None of those interviews were included in this book. We get 10 word snippets from some POWs, but no complete interviews.If you want a ‘description’ of an American POW camp for Germans in WWII Stark Decency is a OK book.If you are looking for something deeper, look elsewhere."
4,"Stark and WW2 prisoners, ETC.","an interesting review of this new england paper industry and how it relatedto the prisoners of world war 2. Similar prisoners worked in the paper industry in Michigan. A little more expansive tale on the same subject is ""Stalag Wisconsin"""
3,Animation Student Review,"Hello,This book brings many good images. Not much character designs, sketches nor early production work, but a bunch of photo-like renders. It might be good reference source for anyone doing layout background design or realistic rendering. I think is a average book, nothing really spacial about it."
4,Fantastic!,"This book is amazing. Even though if the story isn't that great to you, just looking at the pictures is fantastic."
1,waste of time and money,"Picking up and opening this book is a clolossal waste of time. Buying it is a colossal waste of money. If I had been able to rate this with a zero instead of one star, I would have. This book is nothing more than an advertisement for a movie. I do not know how anyone could possibly be interested in ""artwork"" from a computer-generated movie. Sad and pathetic."
5,A new appreciation for Butterflies!!,"This book is easy reading and very entertaining. I see a possiblility for a new beginning for myself and others. ""A New Normal"" gets into the actual life situations we all are faced with dealing with the opposite sex. Very inspiring. My hat is off to you K. Lee for writing this book ""A New Normal"" The bar has been raised! Yes, I have a new appreciation for Butterflies!"
5,The Beloved is the best,This album as all of their other album mixture of dance and slow songs that brings you alive. The song make you feel so many emotion; all good! There is nothing better than sitting down and listening to The Beloved.
4,Vegas history lesson,"While the book is old and dated, the story is extremely well written and keeps the intensity level up there right up to the final pages. While today's Vegas is nothing like the Vegas of old, the book provides a fascinating look into an otherwise secret world. A good read."
3,boring history,a friend recommended this book to me and it was so boring I couldn't finish it. too much history and I love history.
2,Bad Sound Quality,"Although I am not a music officianado, I like good music. When I order CD's online I miss the chance to sample the quality of the recording before purchase. I anxiously took my new CD home to listen and flashback to the days of my favorite music, R& B and Funk. When the first sound came from my Sony system I felt the disappointment. I skipped to songs three, then four. No improvement. The CD had the type of sound you hear on computer downloadeds. It was high pitched and ear offensive. Unhappy!"
5,Good for phonics and funny songs,"Kids like this series a lot. You're in luck if you can run a class through the whole series. From the age 4 to about ten, this is a good series to use to teach some English ideas and concepts effectively. Good use of review, vocabulary building, and songs. Works best with the flashcards and workbook."
5,Outstanding book,"I am Russian and have been in the US for 1 year. This is the first book I read that really explained to me unexplainable things in American foreign policy. Obviously a scholar, Mr. Steel nevertheless does beautiful work in explaining how things really work in practice without any open partisan agenda or moralistic drivel. Thoughtful and balanced book, worth reading particularly for foreigners who would like a better understanding of how American foreign policy works and what the forces behind it are."
4,thanks,"loved it music and really liked the stories with the sogns and transltions. the cover and art work were really nice presenting the songs, translations and stories that went with them. thanks"
3,Cloudy Mess,"This item is in good working order, however the label affixed to the front top of the storage container was so glued on there that removing it was a real problem. It peeled off but left a mess behind. Do you scrape it off and scratch the plastic or do you use Mineral Spirits to remove the sticky goo? Well since Mineral Spirits is used by us all the time for similar problems we chose to use it and it clouded up the whole sticky area. Now I know this does not affect the storage capacity, but sure makes a brand new item look rather ugly. Either this was stored in a poor location or someone was trying to get rid of some ""old"" product."
5,The best organizer out there. Very sturdy - good value organizer for Legos,"Very sturdy - good value - use them to organize my son's Legos. Better than any of the flimsy, and not much cheaper organizers available. Hard to find anywhere else, except Amazon..."
5,Storage for small items,"This product is fantastic for storing small items. No more small jars, no more drawer-type storage units, no more spills of screws, nails, etc. I use this in my RV--it is the answer to storing all of those small hardware items that one must have but doesn't know where to store. The storage device doesn't take up much room, it is easy to see the contents, and the individual compartments are removable so you don't have to take the entire organizer to the job."
2,Not so great,"I bought this case probably six months or so ago, and haven't used it since. I'd bought it in the hopes of using it as an odds and ends storage container for nails, screws, bolts, etc. It works well for the larger items, but the minute you hold it as intended, the smaller pieces fall through the cracks into the other bins, defeating the purpose of the separate bins.While it's still a usable tote, I found the Plano brand (looks like a lunchbox) to be better suited for what I needed. The difference between the two being Plano's method of carrying the smaller bits. Rather than have the cartons tipped on their side, they're always laying flat. The stanley organizing case works against itself.I'll probably end up using it for larger items that are still small enough to fit into the separate bins, but be advised that the case is not suited to carrying small nails and parts."
5,Good stuff,"These things are hard to find anymore in the big box stores in my area. For storing lots of small and medium screws, bolts, or nails they are pretty good. Sweet thing is you can dump the compartments out to re-sort in needed. Nice product."
3,Nice Box - Studiply Expensive.,"I have about twelve of these things - the big ones too. I do carpentry & electrical and they are excellent for sundry hardware. They close well. And hold the contents fairly securely. The clasps are strong and I haven't had any of them break on me yet.The only thing wrong with these boxes is their price. They should be $10 bucks MAX. I use them for my work and I'm kind of an organizer freak. But with all that said, each time I buy one of these things I know I'm getting screwed. Sadly, most similarly purposed boxes simply do not cut the mustard. And this one is serviceable.NOTE: When I bought this box it was $22 and has come down to what I consider a more reasonable price."
4,get organized,"i've tried organizers before with little sucess.coffee cans and old coffee cups did the job quite well. I purchased three stanley 014725r 25 organizers and was very pleased. The items actually stay in the bin where you put them.The bins are also removable so you can take different items to point of use,this aviods the enevatable ""pick-up a million screw game"".It is so well built and very sturdy that I ordered 6 more for to give to other tradesman so they dont ""misplace"" mine onto their trucks."
5,pretty slick,"I took my old multi plastic-drawer storage unit to the Good Will. I got so tired of pulling out a dozen small drawers looking for the right type of screw or whatever.This storage unit is great because it allows me to organize a bunch of small junk in a way that is efficient. I can 'see' each compartment of obscure and various items that I may only use once in a great while. Being able to pull out each individual section is very handy also. These are nice because you can stack them one atop the other to save space on your workbench, and since they are flat, usable space remains on top of the stack.One concern is that the hinges appear to be the first likely fail point. Kinda cheaply made."
5,It works as designed!,"It kept things in their own compartments well. We used one for beads, and they stayed in place even when I shaked it up-side-down. We are going to buy 2 more."
5,Right from start...,Perfecto! Just what I needed without knowing it until I got it ;)Awesome that you can move the cups around and customize what needs to go next to what -- and then change your mind later!
5,Now I can see all the screws that I own,I bought 3 of these units. I rounded up all my screws that were hidden away in various places and now have them organized so I can see what I own. These 3 units will pay for themselves easily considering the price of screws and gas to run to the hardware store.
5,Great Organizer.,"I have a couple different sizes of these stanley organizers, from small to large and they all work great.Thanks"
5,Finally I Found What I Was Looking For,"Because I spent some time researching, it took a while to find what I was looking for. I bought two of these; I use one to organize the extra drip and hose fittings from some old home projects and the other to organize electrical parts for the low voltage lighting system.While it is plastic, it is substantial. The locks seem firm and tight and I love its portability. It follows me around the house and garden!"
1,They discontinued their better model; this one is inferior,"This product is not very useful, because the compartments are of fixed size and the sizes cannot be adjusted. Have a tool or part that's too big for their largest bin? You can't leave bins out to deal with this, because the others will shift around. So, you're out of luck.We really liked Stanley's model 014006R, which was rated #1 by just about everyone (including the ""DIY Guy"") and had 26 compartments with movable partitions. But they discontinued it, and all their so-called ""customer care"" department did, when we asked how to get a few more, was send us boilerplate e-mails in poor English, probably from a sweatshop overseas. For a short while we were able to find a few more of them at Target, and we stocked up, but they're now gone for good.So, Stanley has lost our business. In the future, we will be using the red boxes with movable partitions from Plano Molding, which also have more secure latches on the lid and more reasonable pricing."
2,The label leaves sticky goop behind,"There's no need for me to cover what is already in the other reviews; this is a good, heavy duty case.I just want to warn you that it is not exactly as pictured. One third of the front is covered with a sticker with the product name and other information. When I went to remove the sticker so I could see what was in the compartments, it left a bunch of sticky goo behind. Now I can either use a petroleum distillate and probably leave a cloudy finish on the box and on my lungs, or I can leave it as is to get covered in dust and cat hair.I don't know why the company chose such an adhesive. Are they thinking at all? Someone managed to make a good product, why is does the label have to be such a big ""f--- you""?I'll probably return it. I don't like this case. Two stars means, ""I don't like it,"" so it's getting two stars from me. Your mileage may vary."
1,Ugly Sticker Glue Goo - Unfriendly Packaging,"The greatness of this product is greatly diminished by the HUGE sticker on the clear front cover that leaves behind nasty patches of glue goo that ruins the appearance even after removing the sticker with extreme carefulness.Then, the glue goo attracts dirt which leads to black patches all over the front clear panel.What would you do if a store put a sticker on your new car or a sticker on your pizza that ruined the paint or the pepperoni?A product should come without a horrible sticker which makes the customer have to work for 30 minutes to try to clean it off.Thank you and Peace."
5,Great for LEGO!,"I'm ""helping"" my daughter collect the Lego Mini-figure series, needed something to store all the little pieces, and this was perfect. Note that the cover only opens to about 100 degrees, so it practically sticks up. This makes it easy for the cover to be accidentally knocked or jostled and having it slam close. The item is also very large and you really need to stand over it (especially if you're a kid) to view down all the deep containers. Propping one end up so the item is at an angle will help, but of course the cover will slam down from gravity. Solution is to whittle or cut away the clear tabs near the hinge so the cover opens to about 170 degrees."
4,They were better before the Zag brand was replaced with Stanley,"I've got an older one of these with the Zag brand name on it, and I would give that one 5 stars. The new ones with the Stanley name are not quite the same. The lid has been redesigned eliminating some of the cross braces. The lid now has more flex in it allowing small items to slip out and spill into other bins. It's mostly a problem with flat items, so if you don't have flat items, don't hesitate to purchase."
1,Ridiculous adhesive,"I bought this to supplement another organizer I purchased at The Container Store. There is a large sticker that comes on this container which covers all of the middle compartments making it impossible to see what is inside these compartments. As soon as I got it I took the sticker off and there was a lot of the usual sticker residue underneath. I spent 30 minutes with goof-off, rubbing alcohol and an all purpose cleaner but the residue still won't come off. Now there is just a bunch of leftover residue clouding the top plastic of the container and it attracts all kinds of dirt.Not the fault of the seller of course, but there is absolutely no reason why they needed to use a sticker on top of the container. Now it's not usable and I'm going to send it back and pick up the generic version that I originally bought at The Container Store even though it's more expensive."
5,Perfect for LEGOs!,I use these to organize all of my LEGO parts. Each separation is actually a small little cup that you can remove from the container while building.
4,"Great for parts, now how do I organize the bins?","I have been accumulating a bigger and bigger pile of these lately. They're extremely useful for small parts. I have everything from screws, washers, and nuts to spark plugs in these bins. I really like that I can remove a bin full of the screws I'm using, take it to the work I'm doing, then return it later. I also like that I can rearrange the bins to put them in a configuration that makes sense for the parts in the box.The only problem I now have is that I have to organize my organizers! I'd love to have some sort of rack or cart to store them in, but stanley doesn't seem to sell one. I'm going to probably end up building my own, but it will be totally worth it."
4,Great for something different,"I bought this CD for my wedding. I didn't want the traditional music. There are 2 or 3 songs that are just perfect. The others aren't bad just not the mood I was going for. If you want a little something different, this is it."
5,It's a oldie,Great CD nothing wrong with that but i'ts the same as Disney's Instrumental Impression. Just for the record.
3,Beautiful songs if you can get the CD to play,"This CD is identical to Disney's Instrumental Impression. It's been repackaged but they are the same songs. Why would Disney do that?Also, I could not get this CD to play in my computer. I did get it to play in my car. In the computer, a window popped up with instructions on how to get the CD to play if it didn't start automatically so there must have been issues with it previously. I followed the instructions to the letter but still could not get it to play. The pop up window also contained links to an internet website for games etc.My advice...get Disney's Instrumental Impression and avoid the hassle."
2,Instramental!!!!,I didn't realize when I purchased this CD that is was instramental. I was very disappointed in that. The music is pretty but not quite like the original versions of the songs. It doesn't say it is an instramental in the title and you can't read that on the image because it is too small.
1,"Purchased, but never downloaded.","I just bought this album for a wedding tomorrow. I NEED it now! How the Hell do I get Amazon to talk to me about this crap? I bought this album as a digital download and had to download some other program crap to get the download to DOWNLOAD!!! WTF!?!? The program finished downloading, but the album never downloaded. How do I get it now without buying it again and risking that it doesn't download?"
1,only for lightweight speaker,I put my brand new $400 a pair speakers on these. The weight and size fell within the Sanus parameters. I followed the instuction to the letter. One of the speakers came out and fell breaking the grill. Do not use these for larger speakers if you plan on angling them down. The clamping does not hold. I sent these back and purchased the Btech mounts. They cost more and are MUCH sturdier.
2,"Pass on these, get the B-TECH Ultragrip Pro BT77",I bought a set of these and a set of the B-Tech's. I needed a heavy duty set and a lighter one and figured I'd save a few bucks with these for my rear speakers. BIG MISTAKE. Only saved $7.50 after shipping and the B-Techs are far superior. I really regrett it. Plus the B-Techs are easier to setup and more secure for the speaker.
2,"Ok, but not great.","The installation was fairly straight forward, but the speakers are basically sitting on a couple of metal planks, and can be knocked down. I added velcro to the bottom of the speakers and secured them with straps.They look nice, but I can't recommend them to anyone."
4,Works great for me,"I purchased these to use with an old pair of Paradigm Titans I had laying around and wanted to mount for my home theater. I did not want to drill into the speakers, so I opted for this Sanus product instead. The instructions called for me to mount these with 4 lag bolts; pretty extreme for my uses. I only used 2 and I still think I can do chin ups on them. I understand the other reviewer being upset about s larger speaker not working if the mounts a tilted down. I can imagine the speaker becoming top heavy. However, for a litte pair of Titans, this is the ticket.I would have welcomed extra brackets coming over the top of the speaker - this would have solved the problem of the other reviewer.Sanus generally makes a sturdy, high quality product and these are no exception."
3,Alright for the money,"Nice and strong but the adjustments for the extended arm is poor and not stable. This is somewhat scary using expensive speakers. I modified mine, once installed, I drilled a hole for a screw to go throught the slide portion. It won't slide out now! I wish it had some kind of locking device to hold the swing angle."
4,Good for my rosacea,Several years ago I read that dermatologists were getting good results in reducing rosacea with using glycolic acid peels. After doing some research on google scholar about this I purchased the Aqua Glycolic cleanser and started using it once a day. A month ago I added this cream at night (I wouldn't use it during the day because it doesn't have sunscreen and sun damage is the biggest factor in wrinkling AND skin cancer). I'm happy with the amount of moisuturizing and this line is the best priced of the various glycolic acid products. My local drugstore doesn't keep it in stock but orders it for me and gets it in a day when I ask. Once you've done that and tried it you can order online and avoid paying sales tax. (Most places online will waive shipping charges if you meet a minimum dollar amount.)
5,wonderful for all skin types and ages,i love this cream this is my 3rd reorder but i am still using the first jar.... it was on sale so i ordered more...lasts a long time you only need a small amount each night... it removes dead cells and moisturises as well.... not greasy and no smell....i do not break out.... it is dermatologist recommended so you know it is good....
2,not sure what to make of this product,"I find it too greasy, and I hate the smell! I seriously doubt it can actually clear up dark spots but I cannot really say since I have decided to use it after the summer, so I will not get ridiculously sunburned. I shall come back with update when I start to really use it."
1,Don't say I didn't warn you.........,"After hearing the ""Imagine"" single, I was was psyched to hear this album in its entirety. Needless to say, that after 2 listens, all I can say is ""What was Maynard thinking?""This album blows!!!I have been a huge Tool and APC fan for years, but this album is absolute trash. Aside from ""Imagine"", the rest of the album is just abstract, grade ""A"" Noise.Please, do your self a favor and pass this one by.Hopefully we'll see something new from Tool in the near future."
5,REVOLUTIONARY ART,"I'm Glad That at least on this Album, They're Not Bashing Christian Faith in Christ (JUDITH)Which I think Is Very LAME... But NOW They Came At A level Thats Focused purely on THE Backward System we Live in.GOOD LP, MAYNARD's Take on JOHN LENNON's masterpiece- Has Got to be the STRONGEST EVER. THE ACTUAL MUSIC VIDEO IS VERY HEART WRENCHING AND SAD. This BAND Is GREAT AT THIS.I hope Alot Of you Will get this Album, It'll put a Smile on your Face and then Make you {{{THINK}}}}"
1,Perfect circle is not a perfect circle,They disspoint me they are not like there first cd where it rocks now im bored. how can it be called rock when it sounds like junk. i wounder if people will make this best junk music.if this fourth cd sucks im not going to listen to perfect circle and right now im hereing cd 1 and 2 get those 2 i recomend it
1,Why?,"Why? Why did the have to kill ""Imagine?"" Or ""What's So Funny 'Bout...""Who are these artists that think they can take classics, completely ruin them, and then sleep at night? Completely disgusting."
3,Not exactly my cup of tea ....,"I heard ""Imagine"" on the radio and thought that it was fairly decent song with an innovative sound to it and decided to buy the CD. So, I buy this album in hopes that it will be like ""Thirteenth Step"" but with that added twist and extra turn. Unfortunatlly, I was extremely disappointed with this CD. At the maximum, I like about say four songs on here and they weren't even that good to begin with. I'm not degradeing the entire album because it does have a few diverse and abnormal tunes that are very tasty to the ears, but not that many. The If you are a hardcore APC fan, I would suggest that you should buy it because you might enjoy it more than I did. As for those of you who don't exactly considered themselves a big fan, its a waste of money. I've bought alot more albums that were better than this one at a lower price."
2,My Mistake,"This album is getting very mixed reviews, and I should have read them in more detail before buying the CD. However, it was my mistake and I can only hold myself to blame. I'm a big Maynard fan and felt that he could really nail down some cover songs that would far exceed the originals. However, the only song that even gets close is ""Imagine"", thus the 2 star rating.Beyond that, for me, the album serves to reinforce how good the original songs and artists are (Depeche Mode, Led Zeppelin, etc.), and that I will do much more research before buying a cover album, even from a band/artist I really admire."
1,"Oh Maynard, what happened???","This cd is a disgrace. It is hard to believe the same guy was performing this garbage as the guy who did Undertow, Anemia, and all of Tools stuff. Hell, even the first two APC albums, which I call ""Tool on Prozac"" were way better than this. This album is very, very bad, and I can almost guarantee if you loved Tool, and liked APC's first two albums, you will be greatly disappointed with this release."
2,Just download 'Passive',"All these bands trying to use a political agenda are making a mistake. We don't give a crap. Just make good music. I LOVE APC but this record is disappointing. Please don't be fooled by the positive reviews.If you loved Mer De Noms and Thirteenth Step as I do, this one will disappoint you. Other reviewers can embrace the dark, slow, creepy, un-rocking songs on the album as art and that's their right. There are brooding songs on the first two APC albums that are amazing but this does not deliver. These are just poor covers. There's no other way to say it. That being said, the song 'Passive', the only original on the album, is very cool. It is uptempo, rocking, and delivers the sound and vocals that move you like the best APC songs do."
1,More Liberal Dreck from a band I once enjoyed,Just once - I'd like to enjoy a metal band w/o getting liberal b/s shoved down my throat. This is just another example of California celebrity liberal bubble thinking. I'm sure Tim Robbins & Babs picked this one right up. Shame on you Maynard. Stick to the music.
2,Didn't care for it too much,"I found myself trying really hard to get into this one when ultimately the strain proved too great. It has a couple of good tracks but what happened to the style of music heard in Mer De Noms? That's where the fan base is at, and until APC delivers, then their future might be a little turbulent."
2,"wow, APC HAS LOYAL FANS!","I think its kinda cool, that they made this protest album, but what is REALLY cool is that so many people have responded with such intellegent remarks! Most of them completely true but ALL of them completely opinionated. So, as a review, I would like to Add that this is one record you really just need to hear, and decide for yourself, it's different than the usual APC, but then again All three albums sound completly different. bignOg"
2,ugghh!! Propaganda in music at its worse,"I feel so refreshed that so many people share my views on this. I am troubled by the fact that I have to leave APC a bad review but I gota be honest with myself. For one, I'm about as tired of political propaganda as many are with the war. This CD was just that... 'Nuff said. Politics aside, the whole musical feeling I got from it was really bad. I did not find the endless covers entertaining or creative. I'm really disappointed especially at the creativity I always expect and get from a MJK project. Every song was bogged down as much as the next. The fact that there were only 2 originals made it worse. The problem with covers is that they come from someone elses heart, not yours and it shows. I hope the next APC album makes up for this.Other than that, every Tool and APC album(except emotive) RULES!!!"
5,aMotive,"Check out the remixes cd: aMotive, a very dark industrial remix of the anterior cd Mer de Noms... just great!I can just imagine what will it be like to listen just one of the songs of aMotive in a rave... lola perfect circle roxx!!!!! (also tool)"
1,Bummer,"I LOVED 13th Step and became a Perfect Circle fan because of it. I heard this one wasnt as good, but bought a used copy for a good price and listened with an open mind. What a drag this CD is, it sounds lifeless. The opposite of their last GREAT CD to say the least. Hard to imagine Perfect Circle sounding boring but they do, this isnt just bad it's terrible! And what a shame, because I thought the potential was tremendous after their last disc. I hope this was just an experiment (the protest/cover album) or whatever? I will be patiently waiting for the real followup to Thirteenth Step!"
3,Revolutionary Rock artist or Stoned Anti-war hippie??,"What I expect from Maynard: Some really kick a** music and thought provoking lyrics, preferably NOT about politics. What this album gives the listener: some kind of strange techno-based average music, and even more average, hippie-like lyrics. I picture Maynard with a tie-dye tee shirt on, holding up anti-war signs, and on some heavy narcotics. Maybe some will like it, but it sounds nothing like anything he has produced before (which I love!!!!!!) I dont feel the energy like in the other albums. I dont know which I hate more: the war or this album."
2,a disappointment.,"I didn't like it at all, for a few reasons. It doesn't sound anything like their previous work and they totally changed the songs that It sounds NOTHING like the original. Second, Maynard only sings lead vocals in half the songs, Billy sings the others, and I think thats kind of unfair. I HATE it when there is an album where the lead singer doesnt sing in a lot of the songs. This album is like the equivilant of Linkin park's reanimation, which is VERY experimental, and cannot enjoy listening to it. I only like One song on it. Personally, I hate it when a band covers songs on an entire album. And I thought this was a poor attempt for APC. This album will collect dust in my CD rack. The other two releases never leave my CD player."
2,okish,"This is an OKish album. I love APC, but the cd isnt worth the bucks. Counting bodies.... is good, however some songs sound to upbeat and Sting-like. Just not a good mix. STING-like singing and APC is NO GOOD"
3,a detour,"Maybe it's just me... a lot of people who reviewed this album are unaware that it is merely a cover album of protest songs to coincide with the election. People are bitching about the lyrics... THEY ARE COVER SONGS!! Now, onto the review.This is definitely apc's worst full length. Does that make it bad? no. It just has too many forgetable tracks. Tracks 4,6,7,8,9 are all easily forgetable. They just didn't do enough to keep my attention on those songs. I do commend them for this- they did such a good job with the rewriting of these songs, that they are unrecognizable, in a good way most of the time. If you do buy this album, Passive, Sheep, and the Fiddle &the; Drum are worth the price alone. The other songs are all good, just not apc good."
2,Cacophonous Cover Tunes,"I think it might be useful to preface my review by stating that I normally provide quite charitable, if not subjective, reviews of albums by A Perfect Circle and Tool. This instance, at least in the former sense, is no exception; this album is barely worthy of 2 stars.I'm not going to give a song and dance about the quality of individual songs since the criteria used by reviewers is purely subjective. However, I might as well state that, for me, not even one of the songs succeeded in capturing my attention.In light of their predecessors, these songs take the form of bad cover music. Keenan's rendition of the song ""Imagine"" is embarrassing and probably the most sadistic treatment of Lennon - sans Brinkley's shooting the man himself back in 1980. Songs like ""When the Levee Breaks"" and ""What's Going On"" are equally irreverent.In short, ""EMotive"" falls way short of previous APC accomplishments. Even after multiple listens, this album failed to compel me.Dispensable."
1,should be an EP,Huge fan of APC but this was rushed on emotion instead of created with emotion. It was nice to hear Passive finally made it to disk but after hearing it live it was a let down. The covers had great potential but after several listens this CD likely won't ever see the light of day again. Can I have my $14 back?
2,EEEKKK,"Firstly, let me say that I am huge APC (and tool) fan, but Emotive just didn't fit the bill. Maybe APC just wasn't ready for a cover album (though I must admit, that was a big attention catcher for me), or maybe it was just too much of a change into the negative. Either way... there's alot left to be desired, esp. from a band like APC. Props to Maynard for beautiful vocals and also to Billy for those splendid little re-done riffs, because that's pretty much why I gave the CD a second star at all. All in all, if you're looking for something to leave in your stereo and put on repeat, steer clear. My apologies to all the other fans and all the members of APC. I'll be waiting around for the next album."
4,Not great as13th Step but worth a listen,"The only two tracks on this CD i didnt like were the first one and the last one. There werent a lot of songs that really slapped me silly with sheer musical fabulousness but a handful were great. APC has a kinda murky dissonent sound at times but its crafted into brooding music without becoming noise-- there is still a lot of melody and harmony (except for Counting Bodies Like Sheep... that track is actually a bunch of noises but i like it) Most attractively they use a variety of instrumental sounds and they experiment with unusual percussion rhythms and stuff, and they are NOT punk/emo! I would buy this CD because I dont usually like nearly every song on a CD and this time i did. You dont have to be a big anti-war fanatic to enjoy it, i'm not."
2,Disappointing,"I've always liked A Perfect Circle, from the time before ""Mer de Noms"" came out when they toured with Nine Inch Nails on their Fragility tour, and even now I still believe that they are one of the most original and hardest working bands in the genre today. ""Emotive"", a cover album attempting to express Maynard and co.'s political views, starts off strong with ""Annihilation"", but from that point forward the disc is anything other than what it's title would imply. The following covers, most notably John Lennon's ""Imagine"" and Marvin Gaye's ""What's Going On"" lack any charge or emotional legitimacy, which is a surprising fact considering the band covering them. ""Emotive"" is still worth a listen though for hardcore APC fans, but it is a great disappointment from an otherwise excellent band."
2,Pushing back the new Tool album another year...,"Seriously, don't buy this cd. If you really need it, just get on your favorite file-sharing network or whatever and download it. Only about half the tracks are any good, and that sappy John Lennon song doesn't get better with a fresh coat of gloomy goth paint. There's too much talent in the current incarnation of A Perfect Circle to waste it on a covers album... it frustrates me that Maynard spent time on this when he could have been playing with his tool. I mean with Tool."
1,Disappointing....,"I love Tool. I love APC. I love Maynard. However, this CD is terrible. Maynard and so many other music and film talents need to realize that we don't give a crap what they really think about politics and war (and most social issues). Most of them have so much money their opinions aren't based in reality anyway. We don't buy the music to find out what the meaning of life is. I buy it because I love the way APC takes two guitars and plays them with such awesome power. I sing along but don't really pay attention to the words. Most of the songs are just lousy covers of tired 60s anti-war tunes. Give me a break."
2,dissapointing,"this album is dissapointing overall. Imagine is by far the best song on the cd and is amazing. I think its even better than the original by John Lennon. Other than that song and one or two others, the album is weak overall. Its just too politically driven and the lyrics are all just repitition of things we've all heard before. If you are a strong anti-war liberal, get this album! If you are a huge APC fan, think twice before getting this. The songs manage to retain some semblence of the APC style but overall are quite different and will (most likely) leave you dissapointed (atleast at first)."
1,Not good..,"This album is a hack! Re-makes of ""Imagine"", ""What's going on""??Exactly. Does NOT rock by any means! (I also didn't take Maynard for such a wimp!) I'm done with these guys."
1,Music for Nosepicking Bedwetters,"Mostly I just want to get my star rating into the mix because it's way too high. Just listen to the samples. This is pure crap, and if you like it I got some old Air Supply tapes to sell you. I'm done with these idiots."
1,Lame... (1 STAR),"Yes, it is possible that APC made this to get out of a three record contract. Yes, the band probably knew their hardcores would still buy it without questioning. Yes, it demolishes many of the songs you and I grew up with (When the Levee Breaks, What's Going On, Imagine). Yes, it's all minor key, extra slow, noisy, industrial slop made for Hot Topic listening. Yes, it's aweful. No, there are no highlights.Making your political feelings known is fine, but what happened to their artistry? Political pungents are citing this as the sole reason for Kerry losing the election. Every song sounds exactly the same, and most MJK fans don't care. Those who herrald this album know subconsciously they will be reaching for 13th step in a month 100 times quicker than this one. But, it's something new for them to worship, based on another topic for them to whine about. Kind of funny if you think about it. Horrible. Overall: 2 out of 10."
3,An album of covers... this is strangely familiar...,"We all know that Maynard is very passionate with his views and opinions, so it shouldn't come as a shock that an album of covers about peace/war would be released on Election Day. Good for him, but I really wasn't that impressed with this album. Even if its just covers, with the exception of ""Passive"" (which is one of the best tracks) and ""Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rythm of a War Drum"", most of the songs don't really seem like a lot of time was put into them. I prefer the Replicants album which included Greg Edwards & Ken Andrews (Failure), Paul Darmour (Tool), and Chris Pittman (Lusk), in which Maynard did vocals on a cover of ""Silly Love Songs"". Cover songs are a tough sell and I think maybe he was trying to recreate some of the magic that was in the Replicants record. I love APC and it's nice to have new music from them, but I think some fans took this album a little too seriously. Overall, I give this one a 3 star rating."
3,"Not the best, but decent.","While not a bad cd, this album doesn't really capture what A Perfect Circle is all about. Although you'd think it would with such a political stance, it doesn't. Mer de Noms is a wonderful record, and you should look there if you want to hear them at their best.I really like what they did on a few songs here particularly ""What's Going On"". It has a wonderful atmosphere and tone; it's quite unique. I also enjoy ""Freedom of Choice"" a lot. Billy brings a whole new sound with his vocals on this one, and it rocks like APC songs should. ""Peace Love and Understanding"" is also quite good. But the rest don't really do anything for me. I'm glad that they're working on new things and experimenting, but I think more could be done as far as writing new material.I'm looking forward to the new Tool album whenever that hits."
3,The turning point,"I've like APC ever since I heard ""3 Libras"" and ""The Hollow"". Being a loyal fan, I bought this album. As my score reflects, I'm slighly dissapointed by the CD. Sure, these covers are very ambitious, but it won't take away the feeling that there is only one new song: Passive. However, one of the high points is that Billy Howerdel does some vocals on ""Peace Love and Understanding"", ""People Are People"" and ""Freedom of Choice"". These songs are, in fact, excellent songs. Otherwise, all newbies to APC should listen to Mer de Noms instead. This one's only for the hardcore fans who've been there since the begining."
2,A Perfect Circle; Slightly Askew,"Let me first say I love A Perfect Circle. I've loved the other two outings and am not totally bashing this one. I think this record is extremely over-produced, so many samples and artificial instruments are used and it ruins their vibe. I think the cover of Lennons ""Imagine"" is ambitious, but falls short. I just think that this is such a timeless and sacred song that it shouldn't be tampered with. I think ""Passive"" and ""Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie"" are good songs. Maynard just tried to hard to write political and the lyrics came out kind of cheesy. All in all this is not a bad album. I give them an A for effort. It's a very amibitious attempt and I always respect bands for trying new things....but I want the old APC back. I wouldn't suggest buying this album, but certainly burn it from a friend and see if you like it."
4,OK I Suppose,"My previous review was only 1 star less, but the difference between 3 and 4 is considerable. Simply, the music has grown on me, and songs I dismissed previously I now have quite a quench for. That doesn't mean I've changed my mind on the policies of Emotive that are overwhelmingly anti-war. But I have changed my view of MJK, from superior lyricist and vocalist to well, superior vocalist and schizophrenic lyricist."
3,Stick to Original Material,"APC is one of the few bands in this garbage filled era of Rock N' Roll who are better making songs with their own material then covering past influences. That has never been more apparanet than Emotive. The songs are quite boring to say the least. ""Passive"" sounds better Live (there is a copy of the song circulating out there) and quite a few other songs just hum along to a dull and anti-climatic beat.I believe APC would have been able to protest the current administrations policies more effectivaly if they wrote their own anti-war songs instead of re-hashing old hippie songs. I mean the group is an all-star cast of rock gods for pete-sake.I think the hippies of the sixties have proven that you can b*tch and moan all you want, but if you don't come up with an credible alternative to the current status-quo you are really just whinning and people will begin to turn you off...and that is what I did with Emotive. Someone put on Mer De Noms for me please."
1,you're kidding right?,"words can't even begin to describe how much this album [...]. i understand that there are covers on this album, but you mean to tell me that maynard can't do any better than this? maynard has one of the most unique voices in music and its a shame to see all that talent go to waste. i can't think of one song on this album where maynard uses his full vocal range. the cd is full of whispering and computer inhanced singing ( if that's what you want to call it ). there is also a lack of actual guitar. the entire cd is basically a bunch of computer generated noise! in short if you like the first two cds from APC this one might not be for you because it is nothing like mer de nomes or the 13th step. i hope that they can come back with something better than this next time."
2,"maynard, how you've let me down!","when i heard a perfect circle was coming out with a politically motivated cover album, i about messed myself. i think cover albums are awesome, but this has let me down so much. i first heard ""imagine"" a couple months ago and they turned it into one of the most depressing songs ever, same with ""whats going on"" (granted it was a million times better than that crappy all-star cover a few years ago). zeppelin's when the levee breaks is unrecognizable and boring. maynard chose some great old school punk songs (fear's ""let's have a war"" and black flag's ""gimmie gimmie gimmie"") but they're not good either (well, ""lets have a war"" was pretty cool). devo's freedom of choice was decent, but you know what it's all good...i still love you maynard."
4,Why Billy Why,"I am a big fan of APC and like 13th Step I am sure this album will grow on me. My one complaint about this album is that in Peace Love and Understanding, People are People, and Freedeom of choice Billy sang instead of Maynard. Musically they are good songs but without Maynards voice they aren't as good as they could be. It is not that Billy can't sing, it is that Maynard adds something when he sings that few others can. Hopefully on future APC albums they will stick with Maynards voice."
5,APC does it again!,"Yet another kick-ass CD from the best band (other then Tool) out there... great imagination is shown with their 3rd album, even though it's mostly covers (there are 2 originals, but one is a Tapeworm song and the other a rehash of the best song off of Thirteenth Step) it's still better then 100% of the music out there today... Billy gets to sing lead on 3 tracks, which doesn't take away from the powerful message that APC brings, fight injustice, speak your mind, think for yourself, question authority, if only other bands would get out of the moneymaking mode and concentrate on creating great music like these guys the world would be a better place... BUY IT TODAY, GIVE YOUR $ TO THE BANDS THAT DESERVE IT, AND NOBODY DESERVES IT MORE THEN A PERFECT CIRCLE (except Tool, can't wait for their new one)."
1,HUGE disappointment,"I LOVE Mer de Noms and Thirteenth Step, and think APC is an enormously talented and incredible band, and are even better in concert. I ran out and bought this CD and can't believe how bad it sucks. It is slow, depressing, monotonous, and doesn't do justice at all to the songs, whose original artists must be rolling over in their graves. If APC wanted to share their political thoughts with us, at least they could have been original and kept their edge, a la Rage Against the Machine. War sucks, but this music is even more depressing."
5,For what it's worth...,"I've read few of reviews from disappointed fans acting like this album was created to be a brand new APC album. In my opinion it's not. A new album would be full of new tracks written by the band. This is their dedication to anti-warsentiment, taking existing songs and giving them an APC spin. They do this flawlessly. Imagine is one of the most haunting tracks I've heard. I didn't even recognize it the first time I listened. And this isn't metal. This is APC, and they don't fit into any categories of music out there. You have to go beyond conventional expectations and take this album for what it is, a fresh look at a new war through older songs. With of course, a new track and a remixed track that are incredible. Give this a shot, and don't expect any one style. This album is wonderful."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"APC HAS PUT UP A FUTILE ATTEMPT TO MAKE THIS WORLD MORE PEACEFUL. OR AT LEAST MAKE US LISTEN TO AND ASSESS THE SITUATION ABOUT VIOLENCE AMONG PEOPLE... MUSIC IS BAD AND THE LYRICS ARE DOWN RIGHT ANNOYING. TOTAL WASTE... THE BEST TWO (AND ONLY GOOD) SONGS ARE THE FIRST AND THE SECOND ONES. KEEP IN MIND THAT ""IMAGINE"" IS NOT EVEN THEIR SONG... MAYNARD, COME BACK TO TOOL AND DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO!!! I REALLY REGRET BUYING THIS ALBUM... 13TH STEP WAS APC'S BEST CREATION."
2,"Out of Gas, it seems...","Just download ""Passive"" and feel free to say you own the whole thing. I was quite cautious this time around, since I did not like their second album that much after that huge first rendition, and my fears became a reality. You may keep on ""pusshin it"" if you will, that's the sign of the true fan, but I am a music lover and there are only two kinds o f music: good and bad. This is bad, period. It confirms once again that singers do not make a band, they usually tear it appart."
2,This is half ass at best,With the talent in this band you would expect great things. This is not great by any stretch. this is basically a covers and remix album that should be sold as a single for 5 bucks cause really thats what it is. I suggest previewing before listening.
2,Very Disappointing,"Start with the good- I am a huge MJK fan, and have every Tool and APC release. This disc has a FEW musically interesting moments. Now, on to reality... Sadly this disc is nothing more than a hastily cobbled frothy liberal release, dripping with anti-war propaganda and moonbat fantasies. A collection of songs that, when released originally, ranged from poor to okay (with the exception of Led Zep's ""Levee""), made only slightly better by the band's MUSICAL brilliance (previously I would have said ""brilliance"" without any clarification; now I must clarify that the brilliance does not include much intellectually). This release may end up a best-seller on the UC Berkeley campus, (largely to kids entrenched in liberal propagana du jour masquerading as a ""college education"" spewing from the wordholes of self-righteous soapbox professors), but deserves no merit most anywhere else. A regretable purchase."
2,Huh?,"Tool is one of my three favorite bands, they are producing art. Perfect Circle, well, i generally like the stuff, some is stronger than others. But this? The only reason I gave it two stars because I actually like 'what's going on' and the fact that i finally get to hear 'passive' which was meant to be recorded by tapeworm, a project Maynard was doing with Trent Reznor.This blows, though, and i hate to say that, I really do."
3,Painfully Good,"While Maynard and company have always reveled in the perverse and dark aspects of humanity Emotive is an anguishing concept album as they come. The cover of Lennon's Imagine sounds more like a funeral than the angelic version of the original. As most tracks continue with the general feel of disdain and dark musing on politics, greed, and various other social issues a few minor missteps marr this album. In particular the Black Flag cover of Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie has lost the bite of the original , diluting the sarcastic snarls to a more repetive drone. Overall, Emotive is a fine album when it comes to revelling in our flaws as a society."
1,a dissapointment and an insult,"i give two ratings for this cd:1 star when compared to their previous works and the potential of this band.3 stars when compared to all the garbage that is put out these days.i found the lyrics to be insulting of my intelligence. i love a perfect circle because their songs are bottled emotion that seep into me and provoke different unexepcted feelings and thoughts. the songs on this track however seem more like a lecture (along the lines of the ""drugs are bad"" speaches) when i think war protest songs.. i think of black sabbath with war pigs. that song SHOWS you war is bad as oppossed to telling you its bad. it would have been some more work, but maynard clearly could have done the same. i highly reccomend you buy this cd. it will give you a new found appreciation for mer de noms and thirteenth step."
1,Very Bad,I love Maynard and everything he does. But this doesn't even sound like anything he would make. I listened to it before I bought it and the only reason I bought it was to support the band. It's a shame they put this album out. Almost as big of a disappointment as Kerry losing. I hope the DVD coming out soon will be better. I give all tool and apc albums 5 stars but this doesn't even deserve 1. Sorry.Only good thing was I heard a old song on the tapeworm album that never came out. Good song...to bad on this cd they changed it a little. Was much better before.
4,Hippies Unite :D,"This album, the latest from APC is perhapse one of my favorites. While not exactly a full-fledged album, with APC playing a few covers here and there such as Imagine by John Lennon, one may find several APC originals that are amazing through and through. Passive is a brilliant song that captures the capabilities of the band's instrumental ability to play a song that is captivating and well instrumented, but doesn't overshadow the message or MJK's voice, allowing the song to have a certain effect. Songs such as Whats Goin On, or Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums show a more insightful side of the band, pointing out how things have become a certain way for no good reason (sorry for the vaugness, but i dont want to spoil anything).This CD is very well composed, and deserves a good listen through. Pleasing to the ears and stimulating for the mind, this CD confirms APC as one of my favorite bands."
2,Fans Will Be Surprised,"The problem with this album that fans will have is that Maynard never -really- stuck his blunt views in a record. In all of his other songs he kept it open to interpretation and after listening to all the TOOL and APC albums you'd think that his bands were apathetic; not trying to play off an image, just doing it for the music (Which is a good thing). In Emotive you find that image of the band ruined. After I realized that all the songs were covers and they all tried to force certain views & propaganda on its listener, I couldn't listen to it anymore. Some of the covers sound alright, most of them sound bad.The bottom line for me is that this kind of propagandistic music can work in Hip-Hop or subtly in rock...But when it's added into dark, emotional music such as TOOL or APC it gets sickening."
2,Bland musicianship.,"I gave this album two stars; one for the cover (holograms will always be cool) and one for the song ""Passive"". Other than that there are very few highlights to this album. Annihilation, and Let's Have A War aren't bad, but that's only when comparing them to the other songs on this album. If you're an insomniac this may be your cure."
5,"Remember, its art, not product","The root of all music, lies within. Maynard is an amazing musician/person for even letting anyone know how he really feels about the world. I believe he knows that some people forget that we are ONE race. To me, his ebb flows like an endless river and will be savored forever. Its ashame in the midst of a worldwide pending war, Maynard is the light at the end of the tunnel.Maynard KeenanJFK [murdered]Martin Luther King [murdered]John Lennon [murdered]Jesus [murdered]I don't want to know what a nuclear war is like :("
1,"Well, that's it!!","I went from being a huge fan of APC's first release to not liking this bad at all now. The second release was ok, but nothing great as it was missing so much of what the first release was all about, power, passion, taste and loads of groove. The second release was a tad dull, plodding and just down right boring at times. This release is the last straw for me. This band had so much promise with it's first release and they have gone downhill ever since. Most bands fall off gradually, but this band has managed to run down the hill faster than water flowing from a mountain top. THIS CD SUCKS PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,thanks for ruining everything.,"hey perfect circle:thank you very much for ruining at least 3 classic songs. you have disgraced John Lennon and everything that he stood for with your horrible ""imagine"" cover. I'm sure Marvin Gaye is also rolling in his grave over your disgraceful version of ""what's going on?"", and the mighty Zep is probably laughing at your horrid attempts at ""when the levee breaks"". thanks for giving music critics like myself something to complain about."
1,What Are You Doing?!,"Don't listen to this.. really. Don't You have better things you could be doing with your time other then listen to some goth hippies whine and ruin other peoples songs? I'm sorry, I like APC, I really do. But this album is really effortless and contains little to no good materiel."
1,Disapointing,"As my title suggests this album is disapointing. I read other reviews that shared the same sentiment but I still felt the need to purchase it to see for myself as I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 previous albums.If you have not yet purchased this album and are considering it based on their other albums take heed of this review and the others. This album is almost entirely covers, poorly done ones at that, ones that were much better in their original rendition. This album is slow and boring and never really gets off the ground. If you have not yet purchased this album then don't, save your money as you will most likely be as disapointed with it as I was."
2,What happened?,"So I hear that Perfect Circle has a new album... Everything Maynard has touched has been good... So I buy it. I liked the last two Perfect Circle albums, more than some of the Tool stuff. But this album is the worst (by far) that Maynard has ever done. Trite lyrics, played out riffs... This band has talent, but not in this one."
2,Damn,There were 2 good songs on this album before I took it out of my CD player and FREAKIN CHUCKED IT out my car window. I'm kidding! I do feel it was a bad deal at $18.99 + shipping I wouldn't of mind paying $9.99 for 2 songs. Though I did like that hollogram thing. This is more of a collectors item then a rock album. Their next album will be much better just hang tight.
3,Maynard goes bizzare,"I did not hear about this one but I was in the music store, I saw it and took it without a listen.I did not look at the album and just put it in my cd player. Weird! I realized I was singing along at the second song but the music was so unfamiliar. The same situation keep on repeting all through the album. I finally realized there was only 3 songs I did not know on this album (Annihilation,Passive and Let's have a war).What are they doing with Maynard's voice? He sounds like Robert Smith on ""People are people"" and has a feminine voice on ""When the levee breaks"".I must have heard ""When the levee breaks"" a thousand times by Led Zeppelin but at first, I did not reconized that new age style version which I found really beautiful. Let's have a war is really nice too.Glad to see that Paz is back!"
4,This is a good album.,This is a really good album if you have been a fan of tool. But the only disadvantage of this album is its a lot slower then Tool. I really like the song passive. The voice goes really good with the song. I recomend this album
1,Really!?!?!?,I think Amazon should make a special exception to their star rating and allow zero stars for this album and only this album!HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLEThat's my review. And I thought the 1st two CDs were awesome. A down right horrible album.
1,i would give no stars if i could,"I only like ""Passive"" while the rest are too political and boring for me to listen. I rarely had to skip any Tool tracks or APC on my ipod, but i skip almost every song in this album. I so regret buying this cd... The only people that would enjoy this album are those extreme liberal people who waste their time protesting all day. I could imagine protestors carrying boombox playing this album outside the White House.... so pathetic."
5,"If Radiohead did this, it would be a 5 star average..","Let me first say this:I love this album.From start to finish, I have never liked a cover collection like I did this one. The arrangements are ballsy and come off as pure musical genius.It's not an album for the average Tool/APC fan. it is a slow, mellow album. It's a ""mood record"", and it's a political statement. If you want headbanging ""Judith"" stuff, you wont find it here. (passive is a rocking tune, but it's still nothing like Mer De Noms) If you dont like political rock, then look elsewhere.If you want pure music with an unexpected flair, this one will blow you away."
1,Long time PC and Tool fan wants his money back,"I have been a Tool fan since the mid 90s, the first PC CD was awesome. Emotive is friggen waste of plastic. Half of the CD sounds like it is fillers. A couple of the tunes sound like unimagiontive use of a drum machine and whatever noise they could slop on top of it. Passive is more like what I was expecting. The cover on Imagine was ALMOST an inspired cover. Maynard couldn't quite get the lyrics to fit. Would love to hear it redone with new lyrics. People are People sounds like something my 5 yr old would come up with. Fiddle and the Drum might have been cool cept the lyrics and music were monotonous. Freedom of Choice showed alot of potential but didn't quite get there. Sounded forced and rushed. When the Levee breaks was ok. There are a couple I can't even sit through at all."
2,disappointing,"this album shouldn't have been released, or at most should have been an ep of six songs (tracks 1-5 + 11). imagine's a really neat take on a john lennon song, and passive's also really good. then, the only other good songs are 'when the levee breaks', 'annihilation', 'peace love and understanding', and 'what's going on'. some of these aren't too great for the most part, but all in all are definitely listenable and can be enjoyable.my suggestion is: if you are just getting into a perfect circle, do not buy this album unless you really like industrial music or remixes. rather buy mer de noms (thirteenth step is better, but it takes a while longer to get into than mer do noms and hence is not as good of an introduction to the band)"
1,wasted money,"No disrespect to anyone but I don't care how many people say what Maynard's message was or that it was the ""way"" APC formed the music to their own style....you don't take classic songs and ruin them! Imagine...why? WHy would you do that to John Lennon, I wouldn't be surprised if he did backflips in his grave. Furthermore to offend him and then offend the like's of the late great Marvin Gaye it just takes a new low and level of dissapointment. I am a huge fan of Maynard and tool and the original APC album but they have gotten ""progressively"" worse and this doesn't help. Not only that don't buy this album expecting to hear the sweet sound of Mr. Keenan's voice because BIlly sings lead on the majority of the tracks and he can't sing very well. It wasn't a great album, it wasn't even a good album do yourselves a favor and waste your money on something else."
1,APC has been on a downward spirol,This is like listening to elevator music but worse u cant ignore it because it sucks so much. I loved the previous albums but this deserves to be thrown in the microwave and set on high. I highly recomend u dont buy this album! If anything download it first and see for ur self the agony of disappointment that this album brings. Ahh i hate having to give it even one star.
1,No respect for the dead,"I must admit that I have only heard one song from this cd. It is the cover of John Lennon's classic Imagine. The cover is dark, gloomy, and deppressing. This is the exact opposite of Lennon's version, which is more of a song of hope for the future. I have no respect for this band and do not intend on lisstening to anything else of thiers"
1,Sucks,"This CD sucks so much...all you have to do is listen to the samples Amazon has on this page...seriously, it sounds as if these guys got trashed one night and recorded an album...the songs are so boring, slow, and cliche...I can't even stand the remake of Imagine, the Beatles had a much better version and I'm no hippy"
5,Perfect Circle Blow,I'm not a die-hard Maynard fan but his strength lies in Tool...Perfect Circle are a mediocre whiny rock band that tries to be more than it is. I hate Maynards vocal deliveries on this album and 13th step....It sounds like he is yodelling. freaking annoying. If you have to have one buy Mer De Noms and nothing else...thats the only memorable one. I hope this band doesnt last long.
3,For those who didn't know,"I thought the album was good. I will like anything Tool or APC does because I am a huge fan of Maynard.By the way Mark Twain ""Sam,"" it is the same singer as Tool, maybe that is why it sounds so much like Tool."
4,A bit underrated...,"True, this record may pale in comparison to the ridiculously good ""Thirteenth Step"", but MJK and company deliver on ""Emotive"", an album of anti-war sentiment, re-recorded classics by such artists as Marvin Gaye, John Lennon and Black Flag. The difference between ""Emotive"" and most other records is the fact that 4-5 songs really carry the album, which prevents it from being ""great"", but far from the realm of ""bad"". Tracks such as Annihilation, Passive, Imagine, Let's Start A War, Freedom of Choice and Counting Bodies are killer, and make this record a good choice for the ""industrial hippie"" (as one other reviewer excellently stated) in all of us."
5,A Plea for Peace - Outstanding,"Emotive is a wonderful album that is obviously a passionate plea for peace in a world gone mad. There are very beautiful moments (when the levee breaks, fiddle and drum)in this outstanding album.I highly recommend this album to those who are willing to listen to it with an open mind. It is different from what one may have become accustomed to regarding APC or Tool yet it still has that heavy, dark feel to it."
1,Depressing....,"I understand the fact that everyone is entitled to their own political view, that being the very foundation of our country. But this is not APC. This is not Maynard. It is not for the fact that most of the album is cover songs. I love APC for the mystic, indepth, poetic lyrics and their dynamic range of music which makes their albums into tapestries; art. The fact that they make thier message so blatently obvious so simple just because of their views over politics (on election day no less), I find disgraceful to their name. Maynard is a brillant lyricist. I am disappointed that he felt that he needed to pull a stunt like this to try to influence an election that, had it gone the other way, really would have provided little change. For those like myself who look to Tool and APC for their poetic, inspirational, and thought-provoking music, don't buy this album, stay with MDN and 13th step."
3,Disappointing,I was expecting alot from this album. After the previous albums (Mer De Noms and Thirteenth Step) I was expecting a blowout album. Instead what I got was a disapointment. I give them 3 stars because they're a great band. Best tracks on the album are Imagine and Counting Bodies.
3,None,"Let me just say that this is a good record. I know a lot of people hate it because the only original song is Passive but they reworked the songs and they really made the songs their own the way Rage Against the Machine did with Renegades. What they did with some of the songs are truly amazing but the listener does need to be open minded. This record was also a way for the band, especially Manyard, to express political frustration. Sure there are songs that I don't like and I always skip but the ones I listen to are exceptional. My favorite is When the Levee Breaks and prefer it to the original."
2,biggest disappointment of 2005,"i probably shouldnt be too harsh on this cd because i only heard 30 second previews at borders. i own mer de noms and the thirteenth 2 of my favorite albums, and i heard the single Passive on the radio and it was an amazing song so i thought that if all the songs were as good as that that it would be an essential cd so i was at borders a few weeks after and saw it on the cd shelf and previewed all the tracks. i preveiwed all the songs and was disappointed except for passive. i just fell sorry for all the people that bought this cd as first time APC listeners and now think badly of the band. i mean the cd deserves some credit but for a keenan cd it is pretty much awful. i suggest buying instead of buying this buying APC's first two albums Mer De Noms, and The Thirteenth Step which are both amazing. i also suggest buying the Tool cd's Lateralus and Aenima. hopefully the next APC album will not disappoint and the upcoming Tool album will be worth it"
3,A Cover CD...,"Its a terrific CD in its own right, but it can't be held next to anything else released by APC. I am a fan, I've seen both tours, I've bought every other cd released by APC (or TOOL cd for that matter) so I thought I would buy Emotive and give it a chance even after reading the mixed reviews. The covers have been re-arranged beautifully I really do love some of the songs... But just as I was a little disappointed when I heard the Tori Amos cd-Strange Little Girl's many cover tracks, this album also felt a little hollow to me."
3,Not what you might expect from APC,"First of all, I absolutely love APC's first two albums as well as every one of Tool's albums because they are artistic and creative in so many ways. One of the things I enjoyed about their previous songs is their ability to abstractly convey their messages. After listening to the 13th step hundreds of times I can still see new and different meanings in some songs. That is not easy to do for an artist but it is infinitely amazing.In this album, you don't really need to search too deep to figure what their trying to say because they just give it to you in black in white. Yes this is a political album and yes most of the songs are covers. From a sound perspective, APC added their own touch to already exhisting songs and lyrics, and its not bad. My problem with the album is that there is no added meaning just modified sounds. I do enjoy the sounds but would like to hear the meaning that I hear from some of their previous soungs."
4,Just in time for election,"You know when a band is desperate to come out with an album is when they do covers.. Especially anti-war, especially around election time. I give this 4 stars because of the music.. APC is unique but the idea of this album is a shame.. Mer De Noms is awesome, Thirteenth Step was okay and this one is one big MEH.."
2,Too political...not musical enough,"First off I have to say that I'm a fan of APC and that the song Passive on this album is such a great song; it's probably one of my favorite APC songs ever. With that being said, I wish the other songs on eMotive were as good as this one. Maynard James Keenan definitely had more of a political rather than musical objective when making this album. His political opinions and viewpoints don't really matter to me just as long as his music is good like it was in Mer de Noms and Thirteenth Step. This album lacked that whole APC vibe his previous album had. I give the two star rating because Passive is just such an awesome song especially when I was able to see it on the movie Constantine. Buy Mer de Noms and Thirteenth before getting this album"
2,Mediocre by APC standards,"This album probably carries a lot more weight for fans of the original songs, but I for one could do without yet another rendition of ""What's Going On"". eMOTIVe sounds more like a collection of watered-down remixes of previous singles rather than a standalone work.Still, it's APC, so the album isn't bad by any measure; it just strikes me as lazy. I'd give it four stars if only they'd included a studio version of ""Diary of a Lovesong""."
1,Important enough to write a review,"What a waste... I love Tool and APC, but this album is a total travesty to the reputation they once had. Can't Maynard write music anymore without a complete agenda? This is supposed to be art, not propaganda. With the exception of ""Passive"" and ""When the Levee Breaks"" the entire album is so immature I can't even listen to it. The music is terrible. Their new sound is soft & slow, on par with elevator jingles. And the lyrics are ridiculously childish & annoying. I feel stupid for even buying this. ""Emotive"" is a fallacy of what the band used to be. Save yourself, stay away."
3,Emotive,"eMotive is one bleak album. While made up of covers the album plays as sort of a soundtrack to the apocolypse. For example this could have very well been the soundtrack to that horrible film 2012.As stated before the album is made up of covers. They range from horrible to pretty good. Never great but still pretty good. John Lennons 'Imagine' is more or less forgetable. Its neither great nor bad. It sort of just takes up track space on the record. 'People Are People' is nothing like the original but is still very original even though Maynard's delivery is extremely boring and dull through out the track. And while it's not listed, the bonus track of David Bowie's 'Ashes To Ashes' is just straight up fantastic. One of the best covers of Bowie I have ever heard, in fact it is the best I've ever heard.eMOTIVe is enjoyable for fans of Maynard, but it's far from his or A Perfect Circles best work."
3,It has its moments,"I have a very broad music style, very eclectic. I love music and all genres that are unique or catchy. I liked this cd, but some songs just tried too hard. The first couple songs are good, if anything it's very mellow at times. My favorite songs are 1-4, 10 and 11. They're good, but I agree with a lot of people it's depressing. I think the intentions behind the music is good though, I would love to inspire people to think for themselves politically. With these younger generations coming into the world it's hard to say how politically active any of these kids will be. For me, it was a good cd. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but I don't regret getting it either. If anyone is un-sure go on youtube to listen to the songs fully, that's what I did to make sure I really enjoyed any of the songs at all. I hope this was helpful."
3,Wow...what happened?!,"It took a while to even listen to this album all the way through. The Fear, Black Flag, and Depeche Mode covers are about as god-awful as the experimental remake of a good song can get. That said, the reinterpretations of Joni Mitchell, Lennon, Zeppelin, Marvin Gaye, and Devo are fantastic. Try those if you are having a hard time stomaching this album or if you just want to buy a few songs."
1,"A few great songs, a lot of bad hippy songs","Ever since I first heard Tool, I've been hooked on Maynard's work. And several songs on this disc are no exception. For the most part, however, this is a disgusting hippy love fest. Socialist undertones from highly overrated covers like ""Imagine"" overwhelm the album and make me doubt Maynard's motives. ""Sheep to the War Drum"" indeed... it sounds like Perfect Circle is advocating all the irrational garbage liberals have been putting out since the 1960's, just louder. I would definitely recommend the superb Lateralus from Tool or Thirteenth Step from Perfect Circle over this. Also, the disc of new mixes, aMOTION, pretty much rocks, so I'd pick that up too. If you're one of the anti-war, communist, ""peace love and harmony even while Americans are being slaughtered by religious fanatics"" people, you might like this; otherwise, it's pretty disappointing."
1,You people are nuts if you buy this....,"I had to give it 1 star because Amazon won't let me go lower.Maynard and the boys should be ashamed to have produced this CD. There is not one redeeming song on the whole CD. The vocals on ""When The Levee Breaks"" and ""People are People"" sound like they were made up on the spot without knowing what the music sounded like. If you are a fan of APC, DO NOT buy this CD. It is awful. I liked ""Imagine"" when I first heard it on the radio, but after hearing the entire CD, I can not even listen to that song."
3,Mundane for APC,"Yes, I know this is a cover CD and they did a good job making it their own but I think Maynard is stuck in a political rut. It is affecting his music output. It is extremely limiting and discriminate to be so one sided in one's political views. Why listen to all the money driven talking heads and believe so much in flimsy politicians. This is Tool and APC, two of the most original, influential bands of our time and that's because there was no external bulls**t distractions. It was a pure outlet of talent; Music for music's sake to surge forward. Maynard please get out of this rut and make some good original music. The politricks are pulling you down."
3,Nice try,"Well it pains me to say this but this album is mediocre at best. The entire album is rushed and underproduced. I am a huge Maynard fan, and support anything he will do, but this album was either 1 of 2 things: 1. to get out of their contract on the bands part or 2. for the label to get rid of their contract. Either way, this album does not show the beauty of A Perfect Circle. I don't understand why Maynard only sings on half the tracks, and Billy sings the others. If you buy this album like I did, you are buying it for 3 things. The awesome cover, the ok cover of Imagine, and of course the best track on the album Passive (Vacant of the ill-fated Tapeworm project) which fans have wanted a studio version of for some time. With all that said, I did find track 3, Peace Love and Understanding to be very enjoyable."
1,If you want someone to shove a political message down your throat,"...then this CD is for you. I forgot about that before I picked it up, and then remembered this was one of *those* love it or hate it CD's.There is however, one song I like and that's Passive. All of the others are either horible covers, or he's whispering or talking like he's just been kicked in the nuts. That's NOT good music, hell it's not even music.I've always liked Tool/APC when I've heard their songs, reguardless of their message, but this album sounds terrible."
1,Total Crap.,"Maynard used to be my absolute idol. Now he's just pissing me off. This album was so obviously thrown together as a last minute attempt to shove their political adgenda down everyone's throats in time for elections. I'm sorry if that's harsh, but the cd is just awful. But what can you expect? They put out 13th step, go on tour (which i went to see, frigging rocked) and somewhere in there had time to crap this out. Sorry to everyone who liked it, you are entitled to your opinions, but you all know mine. and what the hell is up with ""counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of a war drum""? can you say recycled crap? Pet was a great song, but there's no need to turn a Da Vinci into a finger painting. I'm sorry."
2,Not as good as I hoped it would be,"I hesitated to buy this album, mostly because when I looked at it in the store, it looked almost ""preachy"" in nature, not like A Perfect Circle's other albums...I have to admit I am having a little bit of buyer's remorse now. Some of the tracks on the album are good, track ten is good (it is the reason I bought the album, track 11 is good too, but some of the other tracks (track 6...Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie...) are REALLY bad (I understand that they are making a statement, but it just doesn't work). The biggest problem I have with this album is that it sounds SO different from their other albums...a little difference is good, but this is just a little too much ""preaching to the choir"" for my taste. My advice...if you don't have any other Perfect Circle CDs, buy Mer de Noms, or Thirteenth Step.If you want to buy this CD, buy it used, don't pay full price for it."
2,Not up to their usual quality of music.,"Most of the songs are on the CD are covers, and don't sound like stuff Maynard normally does. There are a couple songs that bear Maynard's unique style, but most of the CD is not the high-quality of music that I've come to expect from this band. I can appreciate the music even if I don't agree with the lyrics, but it's the music itself which disappoints me this time. The whole thing sounds rushed, as if they just slapped it together to make a point. If you're a fan of his normal work, you might not like this. This is a disappointing album from a band whom I normally expect a very high-quality of music from, and the first time I'm less than satisfied with something Maynard's produced."
2,Dissapointment,"No wonder this CD isn't more popular. It is nowhere as good as their other releases or anything from Tool. Except for two songs, it's a waste IMO."
1,There is nothing perfect about this...,"I am disgusted when mindless trendy bands take a song from a distinguished group of musicians and botch the F out of it, and if this was the only album that APC put out that is the way it would appear. Please, don't waste my money again. Stop with the entire Political chit and put out music that people would enjoy, since you are entertainers. Don't buy this."
4,A Perfect Circle (Emotive LP),"A Perfect Circle is headed by none other than James ""Maynard"" Keenan from the band TOOL. The album is a collection of anti-war cover songs including a few of A Perfect Circle's original songs. Annihilation, Passive, and Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums are all A Perfect Circle's making."
2,The Editorial by Amazon is false,Maynard James Keenan is still a member of TOOL. TOOL has not broken up or anything. It takes them time to perfect thier albums. They are working on a new one as you read this.
2,Dissapointing,"A Perfect Circle has always put together deep, mature, and thought provoking music. While Emotive isn't very deep or mature at least it's thought provoking. Thought provoking as in what in the world were they thinking? The band had just put out 13th Step a year prior to the release of this CD and had been on tour promoting that album before working on Emotive. Why did they need to rush into producing a cover CD full of songs that were written by a bunch of hippies? And after all, what's more ridiculous than Maynard, the same guy who said he wanted to see Armageddon come about, (in Aenema) singing about peace? How freakin hypocritical is that?The musicianship is still of superb quality, and there is a little bit of positive experimentation on this album, but overall it's incredibly dissapointing. A Perfect Circle doesn't need to be playing songs written by a bunch of hippies, they should keep with their own material."
1,"IF NO TOW POINTS, GOOD LUCK!!","IF JEEP DOES NOT HAVE FRONT TOW POINTS THE ""EASY"" INSTALLATION WILL GO BETTER WITH A CUTTING TOURCH, WEILDER AND LOTS OF MODIFICATIONS! A MASTER WELDER WITH A LOT OF IMMIGINATION ON HAND WILL HELP."
4,Soul Searching/Peaceful,"This CD is simply sung, has positively stated affermations, is pleasant to listen to and relieves stress by meditating on the music and song. I have listened to it twice in one session as I was knitting and needed to feel a warmth of ""goodness"". It works!"
3,Time Travel,"The story is about bored USN sailors aboard a large motorized sailboat who are assigned the duty to sail a grid pattern for a scientist testing his revolutionary magnetic antenna for the military. In charge of the crew is an equally bored young lieutenant who only wants to return to home port in Honolulu. He and his crew are frustrated because they cannot seem to get transferred to a ""real"" ship. As time travel novels go, this one is funny and light-hearted. How the crew handles situations involving people from history has funny moments, especially when a beautiful young slave girl is rescued. I read this book 20 years ago and enjoy it still."
1,Disappointing - and written by Jeanette (not Gene),"""Freckles Comes Home"" was actually written by Gene Stratton Porter's daughter Jeanette, some 5 years after her mother's death.The prose is stilted and the characterization implausible - the book opens with Freckles languishing in the Irish mansion of his blustering, autocratic uncle and downtrodden aunt, too proud to tell Mr McLean and the Angel that he is unhappy and wants to come home to Indiana. These are simply not the same people that Gene Stratton Porter wrote about in ""Freckles"".Nothing original except for the unlikely story-line - nature notes (and descriptions of the American characters and scene) are transparently borrowed from ""Freckles"""
1,A total waste of money,"Don't waste your money on this product. It was a chore to put together and looks like it belongs in the cellar. It is ugly, cumbersome, uncomfortable to sit on and uncomfortable to sleep on. Whoever made these needs to use it themselves so they'll take it off the market!"
3,"Mattress less than expected, I'd pay more for a better mattress than this set",The Futon matress is thinner than expected (i wouldn't call this 8 inches thick) and it is VERY Short!Have yet to assemble the frame - but the directions look fairly easy to follow. Am trying to decide on stain.
3,"Good mattress but ""too hard"" for my liking","Pro's: Very thick mattress. Comfortable to sit on. Fit's the futon very well. Very good quality. Arrived much faster than was expected or told it would.Con's: Very heavy. It's also the only ""bed"" I have right now and it's much too ""firm"" for my liking. The first couple of nights weren't too bad but long term I think I will need to get a foam topper or something. Still, it's a really good mattress."
4,A great read. Not to mention a beautifully bound book!,"The story is written as correspondence send between the principle players and makes one feel as if they have intercepted someone's private letters. Makes for a very intriguing read. Also, I was very impressed with the binding and the cover on this book. There is also a ribbon sown into the binding as a place marker. Lovely book to add to ones collection and at a very reasonable price."
2,Worth spending more on something else,"I loved the way that the stroller looked- it matched our carseat perfectly. It steers well, has great shade coverage and very nice cup holders. The BIG problem is that is sometimes gets stuck open and the ""one-hand"" folding mechanism DOES NOT WORK. This has happened to me and my husband. I cannot wait to replace this stroller with a more expensive, safer product."
4,Charlie Brown Great Pumpkin,I purchased this as a gift. The product was in great shape and exactly as shown in the Amazon photo. Will be a display item each Halloween. Very adorable.
2,I have mixed feelings about this book.,"This book has plenty of important information and it presents it in a simple way with concrete examples. That's good. HOWEVER, the edition I had was absolutely riddled with typos, misspellings, and incorrect punctuation. It's hard to take this book about newswriting fundamentals seriously, when one of the fundamentals - accuracy - is so obviously not a priority. Also, I'm not sure that a book is the best way to teach writing, at least this kind of writing. I fell way behind in the reading, but I still got an A in the class. I learned much more from On Writing Well by Zinsser than I did from this book."
3,Great Cooler - But one serious flaw,"As soon as I saw this cooler advertised I knew it would be perfect for poolside parties. It stores and cools dozens of bottles, cans and even king-size wine bottles. And keeps them cool for more than 24 hours. My big complaint is that the faux marble top that came with it looked as if it had been left out in the sun for a couple of years. It was faded and looked like it was covered in bird crap (it wasn't). Don't know if I accidentally got an old one, or if this is how they all look. A real summer bummer."
5,Ease of Use,"The supplements I have taken for years show up just as I need them with the subscribe and save feature. My belief is that a little supplement can do no harm and may be a help as you age, I am 66."
5,Emotions away!,"The Falling Rain has a wonderful selection of poetry from people of all cultures and ages, with different emotions. I happen to be one of these poets from this book. Read ""Love Songs"" by myself, Chris Linski. Also read some of the other anthologies by ILP which also includes my poem ""Picture of Life"" in The Lightness of Being, a poetry anthology. I hope you enjoyed the book as much as I did. Hopefully it has helped you to let out the emotions inside of you!!"
5,Good read,"This book contains a large collection of written works of art. The cover compliments the content within. ""DONOVAN"" is a poem that I wrote for my stepson during a very trying time in my life. It shows the love and compassion that I feel for him and lets the reader know a little about the hardship that I was experiencing. I have other published works in the proceding volumes from The International Library of Poets, be sure to check them out when they are available. Charles F. Gingles Jr. AKA ""TURTLE"""
2,"A hero so stupid, you wish he'd die","Sigurd is neither smart nor clever nor mighty nor noble. He betrays his friends and is easily duped. The main appeal of this story lies in its antagonists: a treacherous wizard, a sly warlord, cunning infant-demon Mori, comical Hross-Bjorn.Elegant descriptive prose and a fast pace fight to redeem a weak storyline (""What's in the box?"") and repetitious dialogue. Deliciously macabre vignettes of opposing the undead monsters of Scandinavian folklore are strung together loosely to create a narrative where character motives are irrelevant to action scenes. Predictable plot twists wouldn't fool a child. Genocide or conquest seem the only solutions to racial unrest between Light Elves and Dark Elves. The denouement, mercifully short, tries to hint at deeper meaning, but misses.This disaster of a novel is fortunately a quick (but not painless) read. Two stars are given for the gory and entertaining monsters."
5,I knew it!!!!,"Any one can see the difference ...real life vs. text book economics...And Prof. Ormerod is focusing mostly on developed countries, let him come down here and take a look at what the IMF recipe and the neoliberal doctrine are doing to little and poor countries like mine...I understand that your position in regard to the different economic schools just reflects your ideology and your growing up social enviroment or what the mass media is telling you...So in a sense you can not bring this discussion to a scientific level....no matter what...And again .....I knew there was some bad smell in those text books!!!!"
1,Irresponsible and Misleading,"Paul Ormerod must be a bitter old man who regrets that he chose to specialize in forecasting macroeconomics as a profession. His criticisms are so off-the-mark that he must make repeated claims that his expose style drivel is directed toward the ""layman"" reader. I find it hard to believe that Ormerod is an economist due to the continuous oversight/misrepresentation in his book. I heard once that it was important to read good books, and even more important to read bad books. With this in mind, I think economists should read this, but I can't recommend it to laymen because it is mostly inaccurate."
2,Blue exercise tubing-SPRI,"I'm not sure if it was the vendor (Red Rock) or if SPRI changed the product, but this is not like my other blue tubing from SPRI. It was not in the usual packaging and did not come with a door attachment! Further, Red Rock did not deliver on time. Very displeased!!"
3,Great product but terrible smelling!,"Loved their Citrus Exfoliating wash so decided to try another one of their cleasner to alternate between the exfoliating wash. It does it job really well and face remains pretty greaseless even after 4 hours. However I must say that the smell is to much to bare. It smells like a mix of insecticide/weed killer/coal tar shampoo! Doesn't smell organic at all, in fact I kept reading the ingredients and rule out the wierd smell could be Ichitol. Definitely will be last bottle for me even if it does wonders."
3,"Fine animation, okay story","Personally I liked My Youth in Arcadia much better, but if you're a die hard Captain Harlock/Galaxy Express 999 fan, then these DVDs are for you."
4,"Super comfortable, but they run big","These sandals are incredibly soft and comfortable but I ordered a 9.5 M (which is what I almost always wear) and they are too long (almost a whole size too long). BUT, I may actually keep them because they were $35 w/free shipping."
5,Lolo in Palolo,"Difficult to find replacement coffee filter for Kitchenaid coffee maker. This replacement fits perfectly and is well constructed, built to last. If you have the Kitchenaid coffee maker, this replacement is highly recommended. Other replacements will probably fit very tightly or may require that the top of the plastic body be trimmed. The negative aspect is its initial cost, but the filter should last a long time."
2,Subpar compared to Gingher,"Compared these back to back with Gingher 8"" dressmaker scissors. Gingher cut much, much smoother. Like fabric was a butter. These seemed to bind, i.e. the blades were hitting too tightly against each other, giving you sensation of metal grinding. Also these are a little bit smaller than Ginghers so they may or may not fit one better."
4,reminds me alot of jean shinoda bolen's book...,"the author covered in this book the exact same goddesses jean shinoda bolen covered in her book goddesses in every woman. am i saying one is better than the other? no,i am not because they are different this book shows us how to communicate with these goddesses. bolen's book teaches us which goddess our personality is most like. i reccomend both these books very highly."
1,WHAT..........................?!,"Although I've not read this book, I've caught Agapi's presentation on public TV. Cute, but has anyone heard of Edith Hamilton?"
5,Intriguing & Interesting,The premise of this book is to mount a case for a common theme or thread that runs throughout the entire Bible: The story of Israel. The Story of Israel is the story of Sin - Exile - Restoration. My interest was peaked from the beginning of the book and the authors do an excellent job of maintaining my interest and making an intriguing case. Watching the story of the Bible unfold as viewed through the lens of the overarching story of God's people - Israel - was fascinating and helped better my understanding of Scripture. Highly recommended!
3,"Good, but could be better","This book by Pate, et al, left me wanting more. This crew comes at the issue of Biblical Theology from a progressive dispensationalist perspective, however they do not give their own views full explanation particularly in the chapter on Revelation. As a non-dispensationalist, I was quite interested in seeing their view on the issue. They do make some good insights, but overall I found reading it a bit slow at times. As a student of Scott Hafemann, I should add that they also misrepresent his view of the Old Covenant on p. 219. His actual view is that the Old Covenant is very much over and done with. But that's another issue."
5,Nice and well made,"Made well, feels strong. it comes with a small container for your nock, tips etc...I feel its great for small tools and backup parts."
3,Not bad for the price.,Not a bad box for the price. Was a little disappointed that the foam was not precut for arrow tips and what not but for $14 you can't go wrong.
4,I like it.,"Fits a decent amount of heads and other accessories in it. The box is slightly small, but it does fit well in my carry bag without taking up too much room."
3,Bow hunter utility box,"Good product for price would be nice if foam for broadheads where precut. Then again what broadhead design would they be cut for? Little clear box in center great for field points, fletching, glue ...MTM Magnum Broadhead Tackle Box"
2,StarBucks Comp,This is a Starbucks compilation. It's not very good. Starbucks tried too hard to make compilations of music that is retro and indie. Some of the songs on the album are good but it's not worth buying the album. I think Starbucks should keep making coffee and forget about making compilations.
5,Great 16 port switch,"I have been using Linksys networking products for about 10 years. I have used products made by NetGear, D-Link, and others as well but I prefer the Linksys (not that the others are bad).In my opinion, the Linksys routers and switches are great for home and small office use. I've built around 10 networks using Linksys switches and routers and have been very pleased. I have never had a failure with a Linksys hub, switch, or router. I have had 1 or 2 bad network cards, but out of 50+ that's not too bad.I've set up 2 networks using this 16 port switch. One of them is still going strong after 5+ years, the other has only been in service for a few months - no problems with either switch. One nice feature of this switch is that it has the same footprint as the WRT54G wireless router series, so you can stack the units."
5,Works Great!,"Speaking to reliability, our company (one of the DOW companies) bought several of these for a testing group over network products that our own company makes! We have used them for over a year now and have had absolutely no problems with any of them. I highly recommend them for cost and reliability."
1,BAD EtherFast 10/100 16-Port Workgroup Switch,I bought this Linksys EtherFast 10/100 16-Port Workgroup Switch from Amazon for my small business office. It worked for 2 months without any issue and it stoped working since then. Have to call customer service couple of times they told me to send then back for a replacement without even they paying the shipping cost. I decided to buy another replacement switch instead of getting an old replacement from Linksys.
2,dragged on...,"I WANTED to like this story ~ I really did!! Loved the premise, the setting, the cover - everything. But I could not get through the book! Ugh...and I am a book finisher - I rarely leave a book unfinished, even if I have to force myself through it. This one...I couldn't even do that. I only made it halfway through. It just went on and on without anything happening! I'm so sorry, I wanted very much to like it, but the story just wound around and around without going anywhere. No action, no dialogue, no suspense...nothing. :("
4,Fascinating,Very enjoyable. I was surprised that it held my attention fairly well all the way through. Excellent imagery; I'd love to visit Lansbury Hall!
2,S....L....O....W.... B....O....O....K....,"Knowing nothing of this book, but being intrigued by the cover, my wife and I picked up the audiobook to listen to while on vacation. We drove across three states wondering if there really was going to be a plot. This book is really for those who like to hear extended descriptions that will continue for pages. Imagine all the chapters from Les Miserables that describe the Battle of Waterloo, the sewer system, and the convent. Well, take all those detailed and monotonous chapters, throw in a wandering child and you have the book. Discovery of a fascinating place with not a lot of story. Sorry, but I had to say it."
4,some context,"Bourdieu's structuralist analyses of gender in Kabyle culture and personal reflections on gender in the modern Western world are consistently cogent, thoughtful, and well-presented. A number of other reviewers have called this book ""unreadable."" It is certainly full of Bourdieu's characteristic jargon, but I would like to note that this jargon is systematically developed throughout all of Bourdieu's work; learning to read it is not unlike learning a language. I therefore would not recommend this text to someone unfamiliar with Bourdieu. First read Distinction, his foundational work on cultural capital, and perhaps Wacquant's introduction to Invitation to a Reflexive Sociology. Take some time. Define and redefine his terminology for yourself. This book, along with his others, will become more readable and, of course, more rewarding."
1,A Response,"Luis, I am prepared to accept everything you say about the provenance of this recording - your knowledge on the subject is greater than mine. But at the end of the day, most of us just buy recordings for listening pleasure rather than historical interest. It doesnt really matter how bad the master tapes were and how hard they tried to do their best. When the end result is as bad as this, it should come with a warning that the sound quality is inferior to what we are entitled to expect on a (full price) CD. Since the recording company has overlooked it, I thought I would let folks know. I also have to disagree about the relative value of the recordings. ""Interesting"" is about the best I can do - but for enjoyment, give me the recent recordings any time. These tracks are no doubt rare, but rarity is generally not much of a guide to quality -except that sometimes recordings become rare because they are not thought worth preserving. Sorry Luis, it's still 1 star for me."
2,Sometimes Puzzling,"Buddha's Dogs is a collection of poems told by a single character about that single character. Satisfaction with these poems depends on whether you're sympatico with the character. Some readers will feel right at home. Other readers, like this one, found the character's behavior often extreme and unaccountably inclined to rage. These poems will be enjoyed by some, but leave others dubious about the character."
2,alright,"Cheaply printed. old story, looks like it was printed off of old print plates or whatever they're called. Like it was put together in the 60's and then given a new cover. But it's the story I was researching and that is the end of that."
1,I may stop using Amazon.com,"After ordering products from Lavilla, reviews were not attached when I purchase, I read reviews that state how bad they really are. The previous reviews were exactly what I experienced. I can't figure out why Amazon even has Lavilla as a seller on their webpage. I plan to stop purchasing anything from Amazon.com or sellers on their site as I never received my merchandise and never received emails explaining why from Amazon or Lavilla. I have never had problems with Amazon.com until now and never plan to use them again."
5,Fuel Pump Replacement for old Johnson,Ordered this to replace the fuel pump on a old Johnson 4hp boat motor. Worked perfect!
4,Missing hardware,The fuel pump came with the two screws to hold the assembly together but not the two screws to fasten the assembly to the outboard - false advertising!
1,"Stay away, peice of junk!!!!!!!!!!","We owned this clock for any 4 months before it broke. It's cute to look at, but the radio sounds horrible and after only 4 months the unit started buzzing so loudly I was afraid to use it any longer. The model has been discountined, so stay clear of this one. We bought the Disney Princess alarm clock/radio as a replacement and love it!!! Much better than the Hello Kitty clock!!"
5,The Greatest Clock/Radio EVER!,"This clock/radio is so cute! The lemon on the brim of the tea cup is a nightlight! I have had mine for a few years and have never had a problem with it. It gets good radio reception, has a battery back up for when the electricity goes out, and the snooze button is a 3-D Hello Kitty figure. If you love Hello Kitty as much as me, you need to add this to your collection!"
4,Can't believe the price,"I bought this alarm clock for my daughter for Christmas. It is very cute and she will love it. I paid $14.99 for it, last week, at Meijers- and they had PILES of them. The item was not even on sale. I cannot believe that it is listed for over a hundred dollars and I am disgusted by the greed of some vendors."
4,Essential Reading,"This book is essential reading for any student of African American literature. The birth of real African American literary tradition dates from 1863 when Wm. Wells Brown wrote ""Clotel,"" the story of the hardships of a mulatto family. The book is available free in e-text form from Project Gutenberg. http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/2046"
5,Daughters of the Law,Daughters of the Law is a great book about the Holocaust. This book tells about a 12-year-old girl whose parents were sent to a concentration camp when they lived in Germany. Her sister died when she was five a when she was taken into a concentration camp.This girl's dad died of a bad heart. She lives with her mother who does not talk and does not share her feelings. Ruthie's feeling build up and she gets upset that her mother doesn't speak with her very often.I enjoyed this book. It was very realistic. It was also very sad. I felt like I learned a lot about the Holocaust from it.
4,Daughters of the law,"In the beginning there was a girl named Kaci, Her and her brother were watching there neighbors house. The neighbor's house got robbed.Kaci and her family decided that that neighborhood was not safe anymore. So they moved to a new neighbor hood. They meet there new neighbor Mrs. Banducci. She was very sneakyKaci and Mrs. Banducci were kidnapped when Kaci unexpectedly came home while robbers where in her house. They were the same robbers that robbed her old neighbor's house. They took Mrs. Banducci too. Kaci used her skills that she had and used them to contact the police since there were no telephones. They were saved and the robbers were put in jail.This book in my opinion was o.k. it was sort of interesting, but I'm more into science fiction books."
1,ugly!,this is the ugliest dolls i have ever seen in my entire life. it gave me nightmares when i first looked at it's face. also i would not recommend putting this near young children or monkeys because they will poop. thank you for attention to this matter.
5,DIO - THE HOLY MAN,"THIS TRIBUTE IS THE BEST OF ALL DIO'S TRIBUTE. NEON KNIGHTS, HEAVEN AND HELL AND THE LAST IN LINE ARE THE BEST TRACKS. MALMSTEEN IS JUST THE BEST PLAYER IN THIS TRIBUTE. NOTHING MORE TO SAY. HOLY DIO IS JUST THE BEST!"
5,Just don't fall through the ceiling....,"Is it true what they say about Mary Poppins!? Probably, because it's 1981, baby!!! It's hilarious, and worth seeing just to show how versatile our favourite nanny really is!!!!It's great when 'Sally' gets mad and throw all kinds of things and swears...""Sally Miles swears!!""... I recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh."
4,"sick, twisted and hilarious","Easily one of Edwards' funniest films, probably because it's so personal for him. The sight of Richard Mulligan wondering through a Hollywood orgy, going through a laundry list of suicide attempts, is worth the price of this video alone. Robert Preston gives a letter-perfect comic performance as a boozy doctor."
2,I musta been drunk!,"I remember lots of laughter in the theater during the 2nd half of this movie back when it came out. Watching it now, it isn't nearly as funny. Either movies are are funnier and raised the bar, or there were alot of us drunk that night."
2,"I did not receive this item yet, and ordered it on 9/16/10.","I ordered this item one month ago as a gift, and the seller promised to send me another copy due to non-performance the first time, and still, on 10/20, I do not have another copy yet. Please send me the movie, I don't want to complain, I just want to have the movie. Thank you."
3,Smutty soft porn,"I know that Julie Andrews was trying to make a statement as to how versatile she is and after Victor Victoria she showed the world how versatile she was, but did she have to make this film in between?This showed a side to her that people who liked her didn't know about, the ""i'm going to be modern and trendy and stay the box office draw, even if i have to bare my breast,"" attitude. She sings brilliantly in it but her acting is over the top, especially in the confrontation with Felix, when a bloke who's in bed is sick through a whole in the roof on Felixs head. The whole film is boring and over the top sexiness and Richard Mulligan, good actor that he is, does go over the top and starts acting like Jim Carrey on happy tablets.Generally, i'd say rent it or see it on T.V and if you are a Julie Andrews fan then buy it but other that don't bother."
4,Good movie great acting,This is one that I had a hard time dealing with. Julies part is small yet she does so much in it. I liked it but just had a hard time with it. Shame on you Blake LOL
3,SOB,"Shipped 22 Oct received 17 Dec. Case was cracked because it was just in plastic envelope, no padding or anything."
4,The first mockumentary?,"I know SOB is not meant as a documentary style movie, but when you look at it's spot on take of Hollywood it reminds me of movies like This Is Spinal Tap. SOB is clearly done as a narrative, but you can see some of the elements that later were used in the 'mockumentary' movies of the 90's. The writing is top-notch and the actors seem to be reveling in their parts. The scene where Robert Preston explains his occupation to the young lady at the party has to rank as one of the top 10 funniest scenes in the movies. The story doesn't wander. Blake Edwards mixes slapstick with dark humor to create a thoroughly enjoyable experience. It's a shame this doesn't get airplay anywhere that I've been able to see, even with 500 channels to surf through. But, I guess that isn't too surprising considering who and what bears the brunt of most of the jokes."
2,A minority opinion: it's not very funny.,"Marisa Berenson is beautiful, and Julie Andrews has a memorable moment, but I didn't find much humor in this film. Most reviewers did; decide for yourself."
4,"S.O.B. Goes Over, Or Under the Top and Bares All","Sometimes a movie appears only to exist for a gimmick. At first appearance this film seems only to exist so that Mary Poppins herself bares her chesties. Not to say it wasn't impressive. This I grant you. But this film is so much more. A horrible bomb when it was released, it is about a bomb that the studio wants to remake into a lavish softcore porno musical. A great cast, sharp writing, and crisp direction give this film bite, edge, and heart. Of all the films that target the big Hollywood system, this is by far the best. It may have been too good for Blake Edwards, because it upset a great deal of important people."
4,Pretty good rock-chick album from Jon Bon Jovi's cousin,"Aside from the lousy cover of the legendary Jefferson Airplane hit ""Somebody To Love,"" the rest of this album is an assured and confident if not commercially successful album full of upbeat energy and well-written, hummable songs. Particularly good are ""Emergency"" and ""A Flower Can't Grow In A Shadow."" If this hadn't been released in 1989, it might have done better, but Jon Bon Jovi was so huge at that time that few people probably even knew that he had a singing cousin."
4,Not all natural as expected,"I expected that this would be all natural cinnamon oil, as was the clove oil purchased from the same company. The ingredients label said it contains natural & artificial cinnamon flavors. I was disappointed in the artificial flavors, but it did produce satisfactory watermelon pickles.Then, I found a two pack of the exact same product from the same company at Walmart locally for only $2.17 versus the $2.74 for only one dram bottle and felt scrooged. I understand this is because of their ""free shipping,"" but could have paid much less.Overall, I wish the description had said it contained artificial flavors. (and yes, I have heard that they are identical in chemical composition and are perfectly safe. I would just prefer all natural for the price)"
4,Snore No More Pillow,"Strong foam smell at first, but let the pillow air out & smell gone. Seems to help with the snoring & sleep better. Probably the best thing was convential pillows got the pillowcase dirty very fast but with this pillow, don't. Little hard, takes some time to get used to. Overall recommended."
1,"Cheap, ineffective, and it has a restocking fee.","From the picture (and the other reviews), I thought that I was getting a firm, quality product.Unfortunately, what I got instead was something that LOOKED like the advertised product, but is made from the cheapest foam possible. Even so, I did try to sleep on the pillow, but the pillow is so light, that it was completely ineffective because it moved out of position with the slightest shift of my body.Don't be fooled, between the restocking fee and the shipping costs, you'll be out an additional $10. Why bother?"
3,"Snore a plenty, but neck relief",I purchased this for both myself and my fiance and it didn't help with his snoring at all! But it's great for sore/achy/weary/tired necks.
1,I need some sleep.,"After I began to use this item I noticed a change: I snored less. However, the reason that I snored less was not because this product worked so well, it was because I could not get to sleep. This pillow is so uncomfortable that it makes it difficult to sleep. As a result, I am constantly tired, and I resent my decision to purchase this item."
1,Snore Plenty,"Bought this pillow in the hopes of quieting my husband's snoring. It seemed to work the first night, but after that nothing was different. Don't waste your money!"
1,NOT EVEN THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS!?!,"First, let me start by saying that I don't like very many of the songs featured here. But, what I will say is that these aren't just re-recorded versions, the original artists who performed them aren't featured!!As the previous reviewer stated, this is virtually like a night at a karaoke bar. Avoid this at all costs.Not recommended."
1,This is so bad that...,"...the only good thing is that immediately after hearing this atrocity you will run to buy the originals! The ""Countdown Singers"" should be banned for life!"
3,My Review,"The book was sometimes exciting but not most of the time. It had all the main things That a mystery book needs. It has a bad guy, the detectives, and the suspects. It is a good book for mystery book lovers.The book was sometimes exciting but not most of the time. It had all the main things That a mystery book needs. It has a bad guy, the detectives, and the suspects. It is a good book for mystery book lovers."
2,Extremely slow start!,"We were new to the A to Z Mysteries series, but excited when we got this book as a gift, since it involves panning for gold in Montana (which we did on vacation a couple years ago). I read the book aloud for my boys (age 8-1/2 and 12), and all three of us were bored with it for the first half of the book.The gold nugget wasn't mentioned until chapter 4 and didn't disappear until chapter 7. Therefore only chapters 8 to 11 (the final chapter) actually involved solving the mystery. The rest was just filler about dude ranch activities and hanging out with friends. We're used to Scooby and other children's mystery books where the mystery is established much earlier in the book.On the positive side, the book has an illustration in almost every chapter and a manageable amount of text per page/chapter, which is definitely a plus for kids who are just starting to read chapter books on their own."
4,Stuart's Review,"Ron Roy paints a coulourful picture of mystery & suspense about 3 friends who go to a dude ranch and discover that someone steals the gold nugget they found. They spend the week panning for gold, chasing down clues and narrowing down the suspects, all guests at the dude ranch.The story is interesting, but the plot was not all that believable, as it is unlikely that three 8-year-olds could catch a world-renown thief. Although this book is written for a slightly younger reader, mystery stories are always fun and enjoyable. I give this book 4 stars out of 5, because it was a bit slow to start off, but as the story developed, I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting to find out what would happen next"
3,Would Have Like More Content,"This book is a hodgepodge of ideas, providing one or two jigs for each tool that a woodworker may use. You jigs for working with routers, table saws, planers, band saws and more. But not enough to make you an expert with any one tool. If you are starting out with woodworking and are setting up an fully equipped workshop, you may find this interesting. And you may find a jig idea that you had not thought of already for one of your tools. But if you are looking for something that really offers a lot of helpful info on any one tool, then I would suggest looking for something specific to that tool. For example, I highly recommend the author's book ""The Table Saw Book"" if you are looking for something on how to use a table saw with great jig ideas for that tool."
3,Buy the specific book for your equipment,"I bought this book as my first woodworking book and thought t0wo much space in a thin book was wasted on the history of the author in the introduction. There isn't much on any one power tool. I bought DeCristoforo's book 'The Table Saw Book' and rated it [4 stars]. I've already started making jigs out of it. After I bought the Bible book, I learned my lesson and checked out several books from the library before purchasing another one. I would recommend the same to anyone as a means to stretch your investment dollar."
3,Good as far as it goes,Decristoforo is done a dis-service by his son in the selection of what is included in this 'bible.' It is more like a digest than a bible. Not too valuable but useful at times.
3,Not a lot of Jigs and Fixtures,"Despite the title, there are NOT a lot of Jigs and Fixtures shown in this book. It is actually a compilation of articles written by RJ and published in Popular Science after old RJ's death. Edited by his son, Dan, and is OK, but not great. This 126 page book was nicely illustrated and there are sections on many different types of stationary power tools that I hope to own one day. There is a nifty table saw jig and a few others that I might build someday, but hardly the treasure trove that the name implies, or that I had hoped for. BUT, the (used) book was in very good condition and worth the small price that I paid for it."
5,A Better Bible,"Although the author has ""gone to God"", his bible has not been bettered by any of the modern ""tips and tricks"" books currently available. The phrase, ""why didn't I think of that"" occurs at each tip, trick or technique. Can't write anymore...I'm busy building jigs."
5,Excellent,"At first, I was kind of skeptical about all this face reading, but after some time reading the book and trying out the face techniques described in the book, I slowly realized that about 95% of the time, my analyzing of the persons face was acurate. This book should be read by anyone trying to get an edge in everyday life"
4,Great Illustrations and Overall Accuracy,"The best part of this book, and what makes it unique compared to other books on Face Reading is the amount and quality of illustrations featured throughout.The illustrations are very professional compared to other books and show a diverse range of people, young and old, and of different origins. It makes it easier to learn the topic.If you're going to buy just on book on face reading - make it this one."
1,The Return of Phrenology?,"It is utterly amazing that the outdated Victorian believes that you can judge a person by the shape of his or her face has returned. Many scientists have labored to dispel these ridiculous notions and now I see them return in a modern book. As other reviewers have mentioned, read the works by Paul Ekman and boycott this book."
3,Haven't I read some of this before?,I'm just wondering if Mr.Fulfer studied under Rose Rosetree's tutelage and didn't want to give her credit? Check out her books and see what I mean...THE POWER OF FACE READING and WRINKLES ARE GOD'S MAKEUP:How you can find meaning in your evolving face.
1,Ludicrous nonsense - can I give negative stars?,It is quite amazing that in the 21st century people still think that people's physical appearance is related to their personality. Are we really so stupid as to believe that people with broad foreheads are erudite and learned?!?I bought this book thinking it would be somewhat scientific but it is not. In fact the author makes no attempt to justify his assertions - he tells you that people with joined eyebrows are likely to be dishonest and you are supposed to believe him. If one made comments based on the colour of one's skin then one would be rightly lambasted.If readers believe that their facial interpretations based on this book are true then they need to read some books on self-deception.I agree with a previous reviewer that this sort of nonsense is vaguely dangerous in that it promotes visual prejudice. Just because it's not about ethnic minorities doesn't mean it isn't worrying.
4,easy to read and good understanding,this book is not trying to be what it is not. It is simple way to understand basic concepts on face reading from a very personal research. I really enjoyed it and although I love face reading and have been a very serious student I think this is a great compliment if you already know some because the author understand this art from a very personal and accurate perspective
4,It really is amazing,"I saw this author speak at a function a few months ago, the book is wonderful and would be helpful to anyone working in a service or ""people"" profession."
5,Great book !,The artwork on this book is excellent. The drawings of the various Star Wars animals are detailed and lifelike. The creatures are drawn in a dynamic fashion making them almost jump off the page. A must have for any Star Wars fan.
3,"Good idea, but needs an update","I like the idea behind this book, but wish it had been done a bit differently. First, some of the pictures of Star Wars wildlife look almost comical. The text is a bit too scarce. I thin the The Illustrated Star Wars Universe (Star Wars) did a much better job on this front, providing real art along with fascinating backstory. I still remember reading about the shapeshifting anthropologist. Also, this book needs a serious update, if only to include episodes II and IIIUPDATE: I bought the 2010 paperback version in the hopes that it had an update to include Episodes II and III. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It's the same exact version as the 2001 book. This means no Boga and none of the creatures from the Geonosis colosseum. This is really a missed opportunity. The book itself has beautiful illustrations, but could have been so much more."
3,Wonderful illustrations. A little pricey at list price,"The Wildlife of Star Wars is a Audubon-like field guide to the creatures and species of many of the classic and episode I-II planets.The illustrations are lavish watercolor-type drawings including several views of each creature--parents with their young, face on, running in their environment, etc. Some include internal drawings of internal systems.Text is somewhat sparse, but I do feel that too much text would have drawn the attention away from the superb illustrations.Drawings are extremely well done, but the list price seems somewhat high. The cover and backing look quite sturdy and the pages are of high quality paper. ...."
5,Absolutely beautiful!,"This book is quite possibly the most masterful artistic compilation relating to Star Wars that has been put out in recent years. From the ""dewback hide"" covers and through every page in between, the reader finds himself immersed in a vision of the Star Wars universe that is so lavish and full of life that he may not want to leave. Clearly, the people who put this book together were not working on a project, they were building a labor of love, and it shows on every page. And yes, it really *is* an excellent wildlife reference too!If you're buying this book for yourself, it will stand out as the pride of your Star Wars library for years to come. If you're buying it as a gift for a fan of any age, prepare to be showered with gratitude. The book is so endearing that even people who may not necessarily be fans of the genre will certainly come to admire it. The Wildlife of Star Wars is well worth every penny."
4,Lucas' zoo,"Who would have thought that George Lucas could have conjured up enough creatures and animals to start his own private zoo? The species described in this book have been detailed in such a fantasic way that it has promise as a TV show on the Animal Channel. It's one of the best Star Wars reference books that I've read and I recommend it to people from animal lovers to those of us that wonder ""Is a Tauntaun a mammal or a lizard?"""
5,An amazing book,"There isn't much bad I can say about this book. It's great to see the wonderful illustrations of some of the most talked about (and never seen) creatures of Star Wars.The artwork is top notch all around with loads of new beasties from the places you know in the Star Wars universe. The book is rather large for a ""field guide"". I know I wouldn't be throwing this in my backpack, but the (what I'm assuming to be) dewback hide cover of the book is great. And the comparative size chart on the inside covers is great. Yep, that's a Space Slug taking up all four inside covers...Overall, if you have any interest in the creatures of SW, this book will not disappoint. Looking at it, you can tell why it's retailing for $.... It is, just simply, an outstanding book."
4,Depressingly good,"As an anime fan, I tend to lean toward drama stories. The more character depth, the better. NTHT has some of the deepest characters I've seen, and while extremely depressing, it has some lighter moments. This is one of the better series I've seen in recent years, and if you are already into anime, pick this up, if not, then see some other stuff first... then pick this up.I haven't bought the boxset, though I am strongly considering it. (I work at a Blockbuster, so I've seen the whole series)"
2,"Great series, not great bonus features","This is my favorite series ever (relatively).But in this product, the extra bonus DVD with the bonus features is kinda useless. The ""making of"" is of the dubbing process, which I didn't really care about. The series were great and the dvd's weren't scratched AT ALL, which is what I cared about the most, but the 4th disc is useless. I wanted to see the actual making of the anime, not the dubbing. I should've bought the 3-disc set and paid less.But still, great series and great quality of the dvd."
4,A bit slow at first,I love anime of all sorts. This is no exception. But some might see this anime as too slow in the beginning. Also some of the things just plainly make no sense. Most animes try to explain why things happen in certain ways but this one didnt even try. The story is nice in other ways and the animation with the story board really helps you understand how creation of anime comes to be. This is good for people who watched anime before and developed a taste for deeper animes.
4,A great epic anime series,I enjoyed this 13-episode show. Not many anime shows are such powerful and touching. This collection consists of all three volumes plus a bonus disc full of extras in a flimsy but effective case. This collection is scheduled for a price cut in half in June 2005. A wonderful show in 4 DVDs for around $25 is no brainer.
5,A Beautiful Epic...,"If really amazing, Metropolis style CGI animation is what you require for viewing Anime, then, yeah...maybe you shouldn't see this. But I thought the animation was pretty nice, and the story was so engaging and heartfelt that even if the animation was Saturday morning cartoon quality, I would have still enjoyed this. During episodes 11-13, there were many moments that I could not fight off tears...this is some intense stuff. If you like Anime that makes you laugh, think and cry, don't sleep on this one."
5,Pleasant surprise,"Watched the first episodes on a whim for no reason one day... ended up buying the whole series soon after. Brilliant from start to finish. Admittedly it slows down a little in the middle but by the time it climaxes and wraps up, there's such a bond formed between the viewer and these characters. Some of the best character development in an anime..."
4,Interesting series,"There are a lot of things to like about this series.The plot is reasonably thoughtful, as we see if the various antagonists can demonstrate that anyone has sufficient redeeming value to be worthy of salvation. The storytelling is direct and competent, and doesn't get sidetracked in gratuitous action, extraneous filler material or the comic relief that I find distracting in many anime series. The animation is above average, and the art designs are often compelling.I have some quibbles, but they are minor. If the anti-hero Shu is a bit too forgiving and pacifistic, his fellow kidnappee Sara compensates. It's too bad the Great Leader is so over-the-top insane that it's incomprehensible why his seeming intelligent underlings don't simply dispose of him for the good of the people.Overall, folks who like Escaflowne or Evangelion should find this entertaining."
3,Not a comprehensive review.,"I bought this for a friend, who was more into this show than I.The show borrows multiple good ideas from other sources (dystopian post-apocalyptic sci-fi, child soldiers, Hollywood, bowl cuts), but in the end it fails to achieve what it's aiming for. That is -- a gritty sci-fi drama. The animation makes any of the darker themes look more unreal and harder to believe. There's rape, murder, torture and insanity, but they are mostly implied, rather than shown, which doesn't help the realism any,while the lacking character development cripples the good, yet somewhat trite, plot.Also the whole thing is too short, which probably contributes to the problems outlined above."
5,Loved it!,"Great story, nice characters and lovely animation to show an anime that deals with strong topics such as war, killing and rape. While still keeping a very simple plot. It was important to me to see how the protagonist never sub-combed and stayed true his convictions through out the story. This is a must watch in the classics of anime :)"
5,What a beauty,"Though this is my first contact with his material, Ryan has apparently been around awhile, tagged with the dreaded ""alt country"" label. Whatever that may have been about, this is another type of creature, combining a grit and beauty rarely seen in today's pop music. Surrounding sumptuous melodies with a combination rock-and-ambient instrumentation (much better than I'm making it sound), this is a superbly crafted & heartfelt piece of work, cinematic in its scope & delivery. More to come, I hope!"
1,Guess How Much I love you: A baby's first yyear,"While I am sure that this calendar is nice, I NEVER recieved it! After I contacted the seller, allnewbooks, they continued to delay me and not give me an answer. This was after a MONTH. Since this calendar is to recored precious memories with my baby girl I had to purcahse another calendar and I am VERY dissipointed that I did not have this in time for the first month of her life. I would NOT EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN!"
4,Easy way to chronicle e baby's first year,"I love this idea and have used it for both of my children during their first year. It is so much easier than a baby book or journal and it creates a simple way to record the little but important things every day both as a reference for the next child and as a cherished treasure to look back upon when they're older. We like this one because of the stickers and classic theme, but wish it had a place to put photos of the child during each month."
2,not a great baby calender,"It has the cute story on each page...but no place for pictures, which I like to have on each month. The stickers that came with it were underwhelming. It didn't have a few that I would have liked include. Other then the cute story I wouldn't reccomend it...just buy the book and get a different calender."
2,Not what I expected...,This calendar has its good points--the stickers and the classic story. But it is not very creative at all. Each month there is space to write your baby's weight and height on the top on the calendar. I've seen other calendars that have different topics to fill in each month. I was under the impression that this calendar would also be like that. This calendar is very basic and pretty boring.
4,Baby calendar,"Bought for a shower gift. Looks cute, but came wrapped in shrink wrap, so have not been able to look at calendar. Hopefully the inside is a nice looking as the outside. Fast shipping."
5,Cute Calendar!,"Really cute and has the stickers I need for developmental stages!My older child had a calender like it, but it had a place to write what your child is like at the top and this one didn't though."
5,Very cute!,"I've bought several first year and also preganacy calendars and this one is quite nice. I really like the look, story and stickers. It also came with a growth chart that was very nice."
5,Adorable Calendar,"This calendar is perfect for our family to record the exciting details of our son's 1st year. It looks just as is appears online. We like it because we can write in what happens on a daily basis. If you want something more formal, I suggest purchasing a baby journal - we have one for pictures and special keepsakes (footprints, birth certificate, etc). The calendar is fairly informal but very cute and a wonderful way to record dates, milestones, and special occasions."
5,Best price and best qualitity.,I purchased this clock for my grandchildren for Christmas and they love it. It has great features and very good qualitity. It came to my house quickly and it was everything I hoped it would be.
2,Not big enough for astronomy,"I have bought 4 of these telescopes for young people and the elderly. It is ok for looking at the moon, but little else. Telescopes must have APERTURE to be useful, and this little 70mm scope's objective lens is too small - try a DS 90mm scope which has much better quality and shows a lot!In addition, the Meade DS scopes usually have only 0.965"" eyepieces, and they are crap. Buy a telescope that uses 1.25"" eyepieces. The DS90 has an adapter that permits 1.25"" and even 2"" eyepieces, which show much more sky when you are observing."
1,save your money,"To be fair, I have never used a telescope before. I have, however, assembled many products using instruction manuals. I found this manual difficult to follow. It lists the assembly instructions in two different areas of the manual and each set of instructions were slightly different from each other. I had the same problem with the alignment instructions. The remote control is impossible to read while it scrolls. I couldn't tell you if the telescope is aligned properly, but we could not see anything with it. We managed to manually find a bright star through the viewfinder, but it looked much better to the naked eye than through the scope. We are very frustrated with this product and will probably return it."
2,Diappointed,"I bought this telescope several years ago and was pretty excited to be able to have something to look at the stars and the moon with. I used it once back in 04-05 and then it sat in a closet until recently. I pulled it out to go look at the moon with friends and come to find out that the workmanship on the unit was pathetic. The focus mechanism was stripped so it would not go in or out without additional assistance, plus the Autostar unit wouldn't turn....it would move the telescope up and down, but not from side to side....pretty sad that I paid $200-300 for this unit and by the second use it was already worthless. Yeah you can use it manually, but by the time you focus in the lens, you've lost what you were looking at. Very shoddy workmanship."
1,May be the Moon,"No stars or other celestial stuff will be shown by the thing .... use it for the Moon, and forget the rest. If you really want to see stars, spend much more bucks. This will be great for my kids' kids."
5,Queen,bought this for my mother. she loves this author. she keeps asking me to order more books from this author.
4,Back when Daredevil was cool.,"Daredevil has been hovering around in the background for far too long. After the recent Kevin Smith-inspired surge in his popularity all sorts of Daredevil stuff is being resurrected. Thankfully they're starting with the good stuff. This collection begins the greatest Daredevil stories that can be found. No matter how glossy and 90's hip Smith made Matt Murdock, Miller made him cool. These are simply some of the finest DD stories around. The downside is that they are not some of the finest Miller stories around. If the only DD stuff you know is Smith's, read and learn. This is where the greatest comic book writer of the '802 cut his teeth."
2,Pedestrian,"This is pretty standard B grade comic book fare. Minimal story arcs, mostly relationship stuff with the Black Widow. No Elektra in this volume. The other plotlines neatly resolve in each issue. There's a pretty lame Bullseye story arc in this volume, and then stories with B-grade supervillains like Gladiator and the Mauler. There's a brief Hulk story that doesn't do much and a short Doctor Octopus interlude that is also nothing special. Miller is only doing the artwork in this volume, not the story or scripting. Unless you're a real big fan, this is not a must have volume."
5,Daredevil- Reborn,"Thankfully Frank Miller stepped in to change the Daredevil story for the better. I don't have to tell anyone how great Stan Lee was, but Daredevil was something of a Spider-Man clone when he first started out, and was chased by some very forgettable villains. But all that changed when the comic was given a new breath of life and now its one of my favorites. I've been collecting MARVEL comics for ages now, and this is one of my favorites. Great stuff, and a must-have for any comic collector. The artwork is visually stunning; the writing is sharp and contains real depth and emotion without sacrificing the quintessential villains and numerous amazing villains. Top-notch stuff."
2,Need to temper the accolades,"Frank Miller was the creative sage behind Dark Knight and the rebirth of comics. That's fact. Although I was not impressed with the drawing style, the totality of his drawing and writing output in that project was perfect.This is not the case here. The drawing style looks awkward. Many other reviewers have praised the layouts cinematic etc but these were achieved by other terrific illustrators with better drawing techniques. Looks like Miller didn't even write most of these stories. I really didn't enjoy the comic, Elektra was OK, Bullseye was way over the top, Kingpin was drawn too large (at times the size of the Hulk) to be believable.Hate to go against the tide but I don't see anything here that deserved a 5 star rating."
5,Nice Mult-Purpose Pouch,"I use this to keep my camera's battery chargers together. I have two Nikon chargers and one Canon Charger. The bag very neatly holds all three chargers and an A/C cord that fits the Nikon chargers. The Canon charger is self-contained and does not need a cord. I don't actually use the front pouch, although you could put a couple of small cables or perhaps another A/C cord in it. It works well with the Op/Tech system and I like it."
2,Movie Themes,"Theme from ""Rocky"" is worth it by itself. Deliverance theme (Dueling Banjos) is good, but is not the original from the movie itself. Just about the rest of it was subpar."
3,from St Cloud MN,"I have used this brand before from the otc pharmacy. If you need light help, this is nice. I use it along with a very low dose of Clonopin and also another otc from like Walgreens with diphenhydramin HCL 25 mg in it."
2,Not the best,"I thought that this would be a whole workout routine, but the hip-hop part loops the same few steps over and over again. I didn't do the ""Lap Dance"" section, so I can't speak on that. But, if you're getting it for the hip-hop, don't bother."
3,hip hop lap dance,"It's a good video, but the hip hop part is sort of stupid and doesn't really go with the rest."
1,A dvd dud,"Not happy with this product. I wanted this version for the hip-hop section. Cardio workout? No, just Carmen Electra trying too hard to look sexy but bopping around like a fool. She has no talent and appears uncoordinated (she has a dance background). The instructional part on the hip-hop is not to bad-a bit simple (could have added a few more moves to learn)-the actual workout is a joke(not long enough to gain any real benefit). The lap-dance section-how do you get fit from that? The background music-boring and a tad old fashioned. Carmen Electra is so into herself instead of drawing in and including her audience. Don't waste your money on making this woman and her producers rich. The only thing about this dvd that deserves one star is the cover."
1,I get the point,"I get the point that she is pretty and has a stunning body - but the move is tedious and I doubt that this can be a part of exercise. If I were a big fan of Carmen Electra, I might enjoy her wierd move. Lucky me! I am normal and not into that wierd move."
4,Funky and Fun,"If you are feeling like working out, but aren't in the mood to throw punches, kicks, or hit the pavement than I suggest her hip hop workout. To get a good cardio burn, you will have to replay the dance section several times, though. I have a lot of fun with it and I am a hip hop teacher. It's very basic movements set to two different types of music. It's like dancin in your bedroom with your bestfriend. After a couple run throughs of the dance, you'll be sweatin and breathin hard."
4,Awsome,"I just received my DVD yesterday and I'm about to buy discs 1 & 2 today! The lap dance was a little strange (I wasn't prepared with the right chair!) but it is a good warm up for the next disc. The Hip-Hop workout was awesome! I definitely worked up a sweat and I am pretty sore today. Carmen makes it look so easy to be sexy while doing this, but I did not exude the same confidence and found myself laughing at my own attempts to look sexy! It was really fun, though, and she takes the time to carefully explain each step. This makes it easy for the non-dancer types such as myself! After I got the steps down (I had to replay the disc several times!), I would rewind just until the last part which is when you go through the whole routine with the music. This is when I really started to get pumped up! I think this is a great workout program, and once I get the steps down well-enough, I think I may be able to feel more sexy while doing them!"
2,My opinion... I'm not really impressed.,"I wasn't really taken away with this video myself. I had purchased this one along with the ""Fit to Strip"" and I much rather liked the Fit to Strip. The FtoS was very intense. The hip hop dance/workout was very easy and not an intense dance. I haven't watched the full lap dance, but I saw enough to know I'm not really interested and wouldn't benefit from it. I know myself just cause I used to be a stripper at one point in my life. It's weight more intense doing the real thing cause you're trying so hard to control yourself from falling on your face or looking stupid for customers. And I'm 23, so I don't think much has changed since then. But no offense to anyone who likes it!"
2,Not quite what it strives to be,"This DVD was vastly disappointing. I wish I had heeded all the reviews I had read online - on Amazon or fitness message boards, but decided to give it a chance because the hip hop segment.This isn't a workout but more of an instructional dance routine, which seems somewhat contrived at that. I have only done it one time, which as it is was enough to learn the whole routine. You also do not quite get smoothness to the routine - it is always stop-and-go, granted it is to learn the steps but it was overdone and made things tedious (and not fun) .. things one does not quite want in a dance workout.If you are looking at this DVD for a workout, please look elsewhere. I recommend the Quick Fix Hip Hop for a good solid dance workout. If you're looking for a stripping/dance routine .. look towards the S Factor series."
4,love the work out but the music didnt make it fun,"I ordered this dvd because back in 2008 i use to work out to it over and over when it was on Comcast on Demand.The only thing i was really disappointed in was the background music, when I first started working out to it, it had a J.Lo upbeat background song that was fun to workout and listen to. I thought it still had that but when i put the dvd in i noticed the music had changed, it really didnt go with the work out at all. All and all id give this dvd 4 stars."
1,Lame,"The lap dance is ok at best. Not sure who taught her to hip hop but it is lame. This is suppose to be a work out, it is not much of a work out at all, maybe for a beginner. However, if you want a work out, try disk 2."
3,Kind of boring,Not as fun as I expected. Thought it would be faster paced and more dancing. I actually felt pretty bored.
2,Meh.,"This video is ""ok"". It's not a workout but if you want to look hot in the bedroom or just learn a fun dance, this is alright."
4,Love it,"I thought that the hip hop dvd was great I love it. the lap dance dvd leave more to be desired, there is very little exercise in this one... but 2 for price of one with both dvds coming together so i won't complain. I would have bought just the hip hop one if i could have, i love this kind of dance and putting it to a somewhat aerobic routine was great. I like using these when i'm not looking to go running or anything too physical."
3,Not the best workout...,"I expected to break a sweat, but this isn't all that strenuous. The lap dance is a ""good enough"" workout to supplement real workout on alternate days, but in all I was dissappointed."
1,Not worth it.,"Maybe the first three DVDs are more entertaining, but the Lap dance and Hip Hop is a very sad DVD. The dvd is composed of an extremely short and not particularly sexy routine that wouldn't be fun to do over again. You would learn better routines by taking one adult jazz combo class. If you want it for a workout, it is not enough to even break a sweat. Save your money."
4,Non-boring workout for the money,"Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. She makes it fun to workout, and I didn't get bored at all. Dancing is a GREAT way to workout and the sexy dances are fun to learn. I feel its money well spent."
3,"Fun and different, but not perfect","The best thing about the Carmen Electra videos is that they are different and not boring. But the $50 box set is paying for a lot more than you are really getting. The routines are all fairly easy. Only the hip hop disc will really get you sweating. The ""Advanced Strip"" is more sexy poses and props than exercise.Kathy Smith is not as sexy as Carmen Electra, but she'll get you more results if you are looking to lose weight."
2,Not a workout!,"I thought that this video would be a fun way to exercise. Turns out it wasn't really a workout at all!! I can say that I never ""felt the burn"" during the video! It did teach the lap dance, but I could have come up with something like that on my own time. Don't bother in buying this video, it wasn't worth the money!"
4,Fun video,This video is a fun workout and can be as strenuous or as easy as you want it to be. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to mix up their workout routine and add something a little sexy and different. Give yourself a lot of space to have fun with this video--it isn't as fun or as good of a workout if you're stuck in a very confined space.
1,booo,I found carmens tape boring and I hated the way she kept saying 'one two one two' and doing the same movements over and over and over. The backround was empty and no one was there with her. It was a bore. I would use another dvd any day over Carmen.
2,By the Bar a round,"I can't believe they published this. The book must have been writted on cocktail napkins before being printed. Chapters are just tossed together, skipping some of the necessary information for the 70-271 exam. Review questions are asked 2 chapters before they are covered. Looking at MS objectives, which Bill forgot to do,the exam covers both Professional and Home versions. The book lacked the information dealing with XP home.The 70-272 section of the book followed the same screwy format of the first.The book is good for genereal reference but not good enough to for a study guide."
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"Having used Sybex Study Guides in the past, I thought this book would be all I needed to pass the 70-271 exam. Boy, was I wrong.The material presented in this book was not nearly in depth enough to properly prepare for the test. After reading this book and using all the resources available on the CD, there were questions on the exam that I was simply not prepared for.If you must buy this book, get other materials to supplement it.Sybex makes some really good study guides. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them."
3,Didn't cover enough material,"I placed an advance order for this book two months prior to release based on past experience with Sybex products. I took 70-271 using only this book (and considerable work experience). I did pass the test (830), but there were several questions on the exam that the book had not addressed at all. I am apprehensive about how well the book will prepare me for 70-272 and I'm considering purchasing additional material. Looking at the reviews on this website, the Timothy L. Warner book appears to be a much better product."
2,This is the old version,"Just so you know, this is the old version. The new version came out in 2006. Don't buy this book unless you need to because it costs less than the new version."
2,Too many errors,"I purchased the first edition of this book nearly two years ago (before the Deluxe Edition) to prepare for the MCDST certification. Unfortunately, I found that many of the 100+ excercises were missing procedural steps or were just flat out wrong (ex. page 360/excercise 9.4). Usually after discovering that a study guide is full of errors and vague explanations I toss the book aside along with anything else ever written by the author. But I have examined other study guide material written by Bill Ferguson and I am convinced he is a competent instructor. I guess the editors of the first edition were in a rush to meet the release date for the 1st edition and did a cursory reading of the manuscript. Hopefully,the errors of the 1st edition have been corrected in the revised Deluxe Edition."
5,If I could give this movie six stars...,"I would! What can be said about ""The Women"" that hasn't already been said? The one-liners come zinging out of the screen so fast that you find yourself rewinding while you think, ""Oh no, she didn't say that!""Some of my favorites include:""And spend the afternoon with Edith Potter? I'd rather have the itch!""""He's a Borgia! An absolute Borgia!""""It's wrong - shockingly wrong!""I guess there are a couple things here and there which could be better - for one thing, this was the age when nobody could write for children. And that ""little Hanes brat"" moaning ""Mother darling... Daddy dearest"" really needs to be put out of her misery.Paulette Goddard's timing is often clunky, and she has trouble with that Hollywood-American-British accent, but really, everyone else is spot on."
3,"Certainly better than the Meg Ryan remake, but not great","The Bottom Line:Joan Crawford is very good as Crystal and Norma Shearer and the rest of the all-female cast distinguish themselves, but the film is far too long (the pace slows down to a crawl when the narrative leaves New York City) and has too little plot to keep a viewer's interest for all 130 minutes; I enjoyed aspects of The Women, but can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.2.5/4"
5,The Women the original film from the late 30's,"Wonderful film with a classic group of women starring in it. Its a classic movie and during that time a movie of just women, not a man in sight,great. I recommend every woman see it, the story line is so true, no matter what generation you are."
1,Poor Quality,"I expected a DVD without defect. Unfortunately, the DVD I received had several glitches that spoiled overall enjoyment. I will not order from this company again."
3,Just ok.,"The Women is considered a classic and although some parts are funny, this film isn't a winner. Joan Crawford is great as the ""other woman"" and Norma Shearer is such a sweet and sensitive actress but othewise than The Women is a letdown. I guess you can call this dramedy anti-feminist but I think this is how real women really act. Love it or hate it, this chick flick deserves a viewing."
5,Great movie1,This is an excellent addition to any collection of classics. The director cleverly stuck with the theme in the play and avoided any men appearing the film. None appear even for a split second!
4,"Excellent movie, great picture quality, not a lot of extras","For those who are wondering about the quality of the transfer (and already know that the quality of the movie itself is excellent): the picture is exceptionally bright, and I'm not sure if it's because of the way it was lit or because of the transfer itself. Picture is not grainy at all, though you occasionally see some film artifacts (like a blob just before Rosalind Russell falls into a container at the department store). Also, there is no commentary, and the documentary isn't about the movie itself."
5,The best ---- has no time line -- works for anytime,"I have looked for this movie for a long time. It is the best ""chick flick"" I have ever seen."
5,Timeless!,"This film is absolutely timeless! All the reviews have perfectly described what this film is. Its a must for the home movie library! I HIGHLY recommend it. It is SO much better than the 2009-2010 or the latest version of today. I almost purchased it after seeing it and came across the original and so glad I purchased the original instead. You will laugh, cry from laughing and totally enjoy it and the special features included in the DVD are extra special too! Buy it you won't be disappointed."
4,A Classic,"This movie is a classic of old cinema. What great names with Norma Shearer and a young Joan Crawford. The great thing about this movie is that it really is ""The Women"". You do not see a man at all in this movie, although it is what they talk about. You have to love a movie that premieres in 1939 and is filled with talk of sex, divorce, affairs, cat fights, and comedy. This movie is completely worth the time and is a testement to a great movie with a baudy topic, but doesn't have to be rated R to get the point across."
5,Women on the verge.,"A delightful romp in the world of high-society dames, circa 1939. Norma Schearer, Rosalind Russell, and a young Joan Crawford head the all-female cast in this sophisticated George Cukor classic. Sharp one-liners, campy dialogue, and witty interplay make this a comedy unlike any other of its time. Without a single four-letter word, this film manages to be intelligently bitchy and wonderfully fun."
4,Women Are Women,"This is a great movie, I feel as I know these women. just go to show you women are women. LOL"
4,No Men Allowed,"Overall a good enjoyable movie. I was slightly disappointed thinking that Joan Crawford was the star of the movie. She is given second billing, however she is really one of the co-stars, this is Norma Shearer's movie. Joan has a lot less screen time than the star, however her character's impact is felt throughout the whole movie. What is really interesting about The Women is the fact that there is not one man seen on screen. The whole movie centers around relationships with men, but no man is seen, what a novel concept!"
4,FUN ENTERTAINMENT!,FUN 1930'S MOVIE. EXCELLENT CAST. GREAT LINES. ALL WOMEN. FUN GIRLS NIGHT MOVIE AND THEN WATCH THE NEWER VERISON WITH MEG RYAN! SKIP THE FASHION SHOW SCENE!
4,The Women,"I am happy with the DVD. Our theatre group is staging The Women and the DVD is invaluable in seeing the costumes, because we are setting it in the 40's time period."
5,Lumiere....musique!!,"It is a must-have on DVD and is quite the lavish spectacle. One of the best examples of the ultra-sophisticated black-and-white all-star comedy that no one could do better than George Cukor. Interesting also is the fact that despite the somewhat dated story of women of a specific social (and financial) station, much of the spirit and acerbic wit hold up very well today. Witness the debate between Norma Shearer and mom Lucile Watson about the importance of the husband (whether he cheats or not) in a woman's existence (the dialogue ""what if I don't want him under those conditions"" is especially timeless). The sets, wardrobe, dialogue, and especially the cast are all first rate. While the film has been digitally preserved for eternity, there is one small flaw in one section of the digital restoration where the black-and-white film gives way to the isolated Technicolor sequence. But it's at a great price. Grab immediately."
5,The Women!,"One of the older versions - or the oldest? Knew it is a fun movie. Newer version is different, but oldest is the best! Enjoy it and happy to have it and the newer version in my library! Worth having in my collection! Was also considered to be a gift, but they already had both newer and this one!"
2,Not the best,"I love old movies but I found this one to be particularly annoying. It was extremely long and slow-paced and I found most of the dialog to be rather agitating. I've seen other old movies like this so I know that it was just the style of movies made back then but I can't stand to watch them. I sat through the entire movie and thought, ""this is definitely one for the donation box"". Like I said, I am a big fan of old movies, just not this one; I actually prefer the remake."
5,The Women,"This is definitely ny favorite movie. Norma Shearer and Rosalind Russell are hilarious as two pampered Park Avenue socialites. Morma Shearer plays Mary Haines, a devoted wife and mother who is greatly upset by marriage troubles about her unfaithful husband. Rosalind Russell plays Sylvia Fowler, a catty gossip who just has to get the dirt on everyone. The best parts are the fight scene in Reno, and the end. This movie is great for anyone who prefers classic movies to the boring and awful recent ones. Rent this movie today"
1,Don't waste your money,"I neglected to read the description closely - THIS IS NOT A BOOK. It's more like an extremely overpriced pamphlet. Do not waste your time or money on this series. I ordered is Aug. 7, got it on 9/9. Extremely disappointed. I give it 1 star because there is no lwer rating to chose from."
4,"I'll be honest, I was intrigued by the title...","This book makes you realize just how pervasive 'consumer culture' is in our everyday lives. While that may bother some people, this book is an enjoyable read because, thoguh intelligent and well researched, its not a dense academic book.I picked it up on a whim, and read through the first thirty pages before realizing that if I didn't get up and buy it, I'd be sittign in the bookstore all day reading it. Read the excerpt here, see if it does the same to you."
5,Fun for any Friends Fan,"If you loved watching Friends, you will love playing this trivia game. I watched EVERY episode at least 3x and I still don't get all the answers so it is good that it is not super easy. For teens to adults. Highly recommend for any Friends fan, and makes a great gift."
2,Not what I expected...,"I expected to be challenged by this game. There were some very good questions, some so good that they were slightly rewritten and repeated. I found the charades part to be impossible. I have seen every show at least four times, so it wasn't that I didn't know what they were talking about. The charades were just too complicated to perform without saying anything. In addition to the many mistakes in grammar and spelling, one question in particluar proved to be a huge disappointment. The questions is simple: ""Name the six member cast of Friends."" I think we all know the answer to that, but sadly the answer on the card is incorrect. They failed to include David Schwimmer! Hardly the trivia challenge I expected."
3,Confusing But Fun,"I just got this game for Christmas (2003) and even though I found it very difficult to understand the rules, I found the game to be quite challenging (love friends but haven't watched every episode). As of yet I haven't found any ""wrong"" answers but I do think the game would be most fun without using the board.The one thing I didn't like was that when a player has all the items, plus the card they could then be told to go to any spot on the board....technically they could go right to the start to win the game.The trivia part of the game is really fun but the board and the rules are pretty confusing."
2,bamboozled,After reading the directions all I could think of was Joey's attempt at being a gameshow host- ie... Bamboozled. It got worse when looked at the questions and found wrong answers.
5,The Best game ever!,"Friends Trivia is oficially the greatest game ever! I love the questions and its so much fun to play with all your friends. Friends is my favorite show and I am so happy this game came out. Whoever created it is the smartest person! The fun never stops with this great game. The charades are soooo amusing. To the owner of Cardinal Toy Industries, whoever you may be, keep the great games coming!!!!"
5,Alrighty-Roo!,"This game is so awesome! I have to admit, I did not quite understand how to play at first, but once I started playing, I was having so much fun.There are a couple of mistakes though. Card #87, it is not Chandler that likes to eat Kung Pao Chicken after sex, it is his mom. Another one is on card #32 (they forgot to name David).Other than that, I would HIGHLY recommend this game. Even more highly if you are a Friends fanatic."
4,Friends Trivia in a Tin,"Friends Trivia in a Tin is the ultimate collector's item for all Friends fanatics. Some questions are easy while others are hard. There are over 1,000 questions, which makes the game more fun because it puts your brain to work. I really enjoyed the game and learning how to play was very easy."
3,Good Questions... Bad Game Play,"I am a huge friend fan, so I was very excited to play Friends Trivia. I ripped the box open and started reading the questions. The questions are excellent. And theres lots of them. But when I scrounged up some friends to actually play the game I was let down. The game board, and rules are just not set up right. With three years of graphic design I created my own board and pasted it ontop the old one. With Trivia Pursuit like gameplay and board Im very happy with my game. I recommend buying this game and altering it to your needs. Search for ""alternative friends game board"" to alter yours."
2,Don't waste your hard earned money here!,"The game is somewhat boring. The Tin crushes under the weight of a 2 year old. The worst part....the questions have WRONG ANSWERS!Being the friendaholic that I am, I have every single episode. So I just go to the video to check answer....oops WRONG ANSWER stupid Trivia Tin. So do we go by what the game says or by what actually happened. Dumb Dumb Dumb!"
2,Scrap the board and make your own game,"I bought this game to play with several die-hard Friends fans. After about 10 minutes of trying to figure out to to play the game, we scraped the board and just sat around asking questions from the cards. Game board isn't user-friendly. I suggest making your own game up with the cards, like a drinking game or something similar."
3,Not enough Change,"The guitarwork is fantastic, but I have two chief complaints: A good cd needs something to slow down the tempo every couple of songs. There's nothing that breaks the monotony. The final track, ""The end is where it begins"" would have been much better somewhere in the middle. The hardcore vocals are also good to a point--but song after song there is little change in the bellowing and ends up sounding monotone. I don't distinguish between ""metal"" and ""metalcore"" so I won't enter that debate. This album has alot of energy, I just think it could have been more properly channeled."
1,"uh, they suck","I really feel sorry for anyone who bought this album. This music is very boring and predictable, more of the same metalcore. Metalcore is the worst! Manntis are only popular because they were on that Battle for Ozzfest show. All that show was was a 'metal' version of American Idol. This band was made on TV with pretty much no effort made on the bands part at all. They made it because their guitarist can show how cool he is, and I guess he succeeded. CenturyMedia and MTV must have some secret conspiracy going in relation to this band, which is a shame, because CenturyMedia usually puts out quality albums on its label."
4,manntis steps up to prove their real talen outside of televison,"well adair is one heck of a guitar played and i dont doubt that it shows on the new debut from century media with label mates shadows fall, but they deliver with sleep in your grave, i was hoping for adair and manntis to win especially after watching them perform on the second stage when the lead singers nose started bleeding. but well worth the purchaase of straight up ear bleeding metalcore- or in his case nose bleeding"
5,a little over 28 minutes short album,but every second of it is metal gold. this cd is so much better than i was expecting them to be watching battle for ozzfest . i cant spell the guys name but you all know who he is he was my favorite cast member and from listening to this cd one hell of a guitar player. although the cd in itself is short none of the songs seem to be too short. this is a great cd century media continues to show why they are one of the best if not th best metal label out there.
1,More like Yuck!,"What a stupid excuse for a book! The only redeeming feature was the hero--hot, sexy & darkly tortured in the appropriate way for a good romance read. Unfortunately the rest of the book sucked sewage. The heroine is so abyssmally stupid that she should be spayed so her DNA doesn't contaminate the next generation, the two grandmothers come off as loony fruitcakes (probably added to provide the obligatory eccentric secondary characters for humor), the heroine's dog should be shot, and the whole story is absolutely ridiculous--she won't marry him because she overhears some of her father's friends talking about the fact that she's a jinx (yeah, I base all my major life decisions on gossip I overhear from my local uneducated criminal class). This book stinks! With some major editing, at least my suffering would have ended sooner, but at 447 pages, the boredom just goes on & on & one & on. Save yourself!"
2,"Must have had a ""off"" day.","First, I am absolutely crazy for Betina Kranhn's books; except this one.They generally capture you from the beginning and make it hard for you to stop reading. Not this one, I read and read and read. By page 117 I gave in to boredom and put it down. Really didn't care what happened to ANYBODY in the story. Was extremely disappointed that it was so different from her usual.With that said, I can't wait to get hold of the next one she writes."
4,This book is totaly unpredicable!,This book has you almost falling off of your seat. Just when you think that everything is over you find out that it has just begun. One thing that I like about this book is that there is logic behind everything that happens. It is not one of those books in which things happen for no reason. That is one of the reasons it is so suspensful
3,"Not bad, but nowhere near his best.","The first and most obvious problem is that the entire premise of the novel - that there are oceans of ultra-dessicated dust on the moon, and that a ship designed to 'sail' on them sinks and has to be rescued - has been thoroughly disproven. There are no seas of dust anywhere on the moon. The second is that, from a literary perspective, this is definitely a more mediocre performance by Clarke. When you compare it with <u>Rendezvous With Rama</u> or <u>The City and the Stars</u>, you may even wonder if the same person wrote them. It's just not as well written as most of Clarke's works. ..."
2,Irwin Allen disaster movie ripoff on the moon.,"Take the story of a ship stranded in the south pacific, take away the air and voila!Pulp science fiction novels made it to the 1960's. A Fall of Moondust proves this to be true. An SF disaster novel, it reads like so many other people vs. natural disaster novels."
4,Solid sci-fi,I liked this shorter story by a sci-fi great. Not all that implausible either! The science fiction of today - is the science fact of the very near future. This story will entertain you until the end.
4,great sci-fie,great classic sci-fideserves to be made into a movie someday much like the old airport movies.
5,5 Masterpieces!,"This collection has 5 ACC stories, and among them 3 of the best science fiction stories of all-time. You will be hard-pressed to find an SF fan who will tell you that 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rendezvous With Rama, and The City & The Stars are not three of the best science fiction books ever written. And the reason, is simply because they ARE three of the best! Each one is a masterpiece in it's own right, the kind of future story that could only have come from Arthur C. Clarke. No one else could've written these books. That's not to discount the other two stories in this collection: The Deep Range (which is a good book about the sea (not space!) which a very poetic ending), and A Fall of Moondust, another ACC classic. If Amazon ever gets this book back, be sure to order it!"
2,Too Much Paper for Content.,"I have to admit I haven't read it all but browsed it enough to see that the subjects are not treated deeply enough and that there is a great deal of paper for nothing.This 600 pages book could have been delivered at below 400 with the same content and font size.Each 2 pages chapter, is followed a 1.5 page lab which asks questions with big space to enter answers (as if we would start writing our answers in the book.) Following, the questions are REPEATED along with the answers to them. What a waste of paper!It's a very general overview of the different medias that does not really answer most questions. Could be nice for a web graphics 101 course, but not alone for sure. I'm happy I did not buy and could pull it from the library."
1,Don't waste your time or money,I agree with the previous reviewer ... the book is a good size in pages only ... what is on the pages is a waste. I would recommend this book to is someone who does not know a thing about web graphics and has the time to read 600 pages for an overview of the different technologies.
3,Had to check it out....,"Actually I had to purchase book #1 and #4 to read the series because someone gave me #2 and #3. In the reviews given by other writers like Stephen King, John Farris was one of the best new thriller writers...keep you on edge of your seat type. Well, I do like Stephen King though he does write in circles sometimes........John Farris is so much worse that you don't truly get into what the book is about until it's almost over. Sad thing is all 4 books in this series are written the same way, though I do have to say that book #4 was the easiest to read.It's not a writer or series I would really recommend purchasing but if your local library has them, it would be worth checking out."
3,Super Reader,"This is a precursor to the whole Firestarter and Teek type plot. Gift psionic ability youngster wanted by extremely dodgy government agency.In this case, however, there are two kids, and the father trying to protect his child is also a trained government killer. They have an earlier handle on the whole offensive use of weapons of the mind, too.In other words, I wouldn't be putting my hand up and volunteering to try and bring them in."
2,16 Days in 90 Minutes,"This could have been a pleasant enough souvenir of the 2002 Winter Olympics. It is not surprising that each sport is given a miniscule amount of time, with only a few seconds each devoted to the opening and closing ceremonies. It is not surprising that, whenever possible, the producers acted as if only Americans were competing in each sport. What IS surprising is that the producers chose to underscore almost every second of the documentary (even the figure skating!) with cheesy synthesizer music. Go ahead and get it, but be forewarned. And the bonus footage IS well-done."
1,bad compilation,"I expected this DVD to feature some complete events and it didbut it was not the original, had its own music over it and just plainly... For example, the pairs skating of both the Russian and Canadian teams, yes they were complete, but it wasn't the one seen on TV with the music that they skated to with the commnetary. It has music over it and was extremely dissapointing. If you want to remember the events for the way they happened, this DVD isn't the way to go"
2,Not as complete as hoped,"The problem with this video is the incomplete footage throughout the video. I was hoping there would be the complete opening ceremony, but only got a two minute highlight. Each event highlight segment is too short to really appreciate what was accomplished. Also missing is the editorials about the athletes and countries. The video just seems really incomplete and I wished there was more."
2,clear images...,and that's about it.Audio is distorted.Poor Costas doesn't sound like himself.Tracking doesn't match the outer package program.
5,I LOVE this map!,"A foot wide and eleven feet tall IS a weird shape for a chart, but I find it to be very enjoyable because it shows the whole inside passage in detail. Where else can you find something like this? Let's hope this map stays around. It's a great concept and allows one a greater appreciation of the region."
3,Good general info but needs upgrading,"The chart is good for general information contained in one document. The quality of construction is excellent, allowing opening and closing many times without any tearing. As many of the cruies ships go further north of the present chart, the chart would be of greater value if it were extended to the Seward AK area. The course on the chart was a bit confusing as the ship I was on used a different route."
1,Just maps very little narrative,"When I received this item, I thought they had forgotten to send me the book and had only enclosed the maps. They sent it to me again and then I realised that this flat map was the whole thing. Very dissapointed. Not much info for the price."
1,Christmas present,"This clock was for my grandson. Shipping was fast, however the clock never worked properly from the start. I live in TX and he's in IN so his mom never told me this until months after purchased. It was broke when received."
3,Good telescope for the beginner,"This is an acceptable scope if you get it for $250 or less. If you intend to spend more than that, get yourself an 8"" or 10"" dobsonian.After using it for a few months, I now realise that its not the electronics and motors that matter in a good telescope, but the optics for a beginner. The 4.5"" primary mirror is good enough for planetary / lunar observation. The eyepieces that come with this scope are just acceptable, and I can afford to have kids smear jam and butter on them. For my own use, I use a set of Series 4000 plossls I purchased separately.I do want to add that Meade customer service is excellent. If I were to purchase a higher end scope, I would go to Meade. Primarily because of their superb customer service.Hope that helps.Clear skies :-)"
1,Very Poor Quality,"Telescopes are supposed to be precision instruments, but this scope is not. I found that the gears slipped inside the mount, which makes it impossible slew accurately. Save your money!"
2,So-so,"If you're not lucky and you need to collimate the telescope, you'll quicky regret buying this newtownian. Collimating a telescope is a real pain, the instructions are not clear and the customer support at Meade is mediocre at best.After many tries, I was able to collimate the thing and was able to see saturn's rings. The autostart is a wonderful thing, the tripod is pretty good. I did return the telescope because the altitude lock broke."
1,very disappointing,"i really loved Box Office Poison and Tricked. Alex Robinson was a genius.now after reading this mess i am really disappointed.the book takes place during the Box Office Poison plot but characters behave differently, you can see things that could not have happened, logic went bye bye.if you loved Box Office Poison (like me) do yourself a favor and skip this book. this way you can remember Box Office Poison as a masterpiece."
5,Most comfortable pants on the market,"I have these pants in different colors and live in them. They are the most comfortable, giving pants and yet look dressy enough to wear to the office. They wash and dry easily and look like new afterwards."
5,"THANK GOODNESS, I COULD FIND A BIG SIZE !!!!","Its always hard to find size 26 Lee pants, looks like companies/stores would know that whey are always bought first. Really am glad that I can sign on and find a pair of pants to fit. Thanks. Lee are the very best !!!!"
4,AWESOME,"Hey I'm Natalie and I thought that this book was wonderful. A wonderful book on it's own and a wonderful sequal to the first one Boston Jane:An Adventure. I don't suggest reading it on it's own though. Well written, it may be kind of easy for teens but they will like as well since it also has a somewhat romantic plot interwoven into it."
5,One of the Greatest Books of all Time,"This book is one of the greatest books of all time! It includes all of the elements I love in books- romance, adventure, and a happy ending. The world has never seen anything as wonderful as Boston Jane: Wilderness Days. It is my favorite book in the series! Jennifer L. Holm is a genius!"
3,Ok swim vest,I have mixed feelings about this swim vest. It didn't fit very well or last very long but it served it's purpose. It didn't keep my son afloat on his own but it made it easier for me to hold him and I wasn't as nervous about having him near the pool when he had it on.
1,Vest review,I am very disappointed with this vest. I know it isn't made like a life vest but my 19 month old was walking around our 2 foot deep pool with the vest on and went completetly under many times. I do not feel he is safe in it unless i am holding him in some way. It may help them from sinking all the way to the bottom but doesn't give me any piece of mind.
4,Very Good Dispensational Commentary,"This is a very good commentary by Dr.Pentecost. It's written from a dispensational point of view, but it also shows that the sermon exhibits God's holiness, which drives man to see his sinfulness and need of Christ. Some parts are truly inspiring and leaves one with the desire to lead a more pure and holy life, and live for God's glory."
3,Kitchen Shears,"This product is pretty good. They are heavy duty and will cut chicken, other meats and herbs. However they are not sharp enough to cut paper, plastic or other plastics and packaging efficiently. I was pleased with the heavy duty nature of the shears and they were as expected of a kitchenaid product. However, what wasn't expected was the rust spots that showed up on a stainless steel product after the first washing. Overall they are worth what I paid on Amazon, but I wouldn't repeat the buy regular retail."
5,A surprising kitchen too,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CF2U46/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgI half expected this product to be disappointing. I had a friend that wanted me to order a pair for him so I ordered a pair for myself at the same time. They turned out to be amazing. I cook a lot of boneless chicken breasts. These scissors are perfect for trimming the fat and undesirable parts off the breasts and for cutting the chicken in strips for frying. The knife portion is very sharp and very useful when already using the scissors. I could not be happier with my purchase. This is one product that, when you use it, you feel like you underpaid."
3,interesting design,"These work pretty well as shears, although the santoku-style blade proves to be a bit too wide for a lot of the work I usually do with shears. The santoku-style blade side comes in handy as a knife if you're in a hurry or don't want to dirty another utensil... just pop it apart and go."
5,testament to the human spirit - highly depressing,"As a viewer of many many anime series, I have to say that this show is the most depressing I have seen. Don't let the character designes fool you, as it contains elements that are often glossed over in war movies...Unlike the other major depressing anime, Grave of the Fireflies, this show doesn't even let you cry to release the emotional tension it builds. The harshness of battle and war on the young recruits, the psychotic ""leader"" Hamdo, and the fate of LaLaRu and Shu are all depicted in the gritty reality that is war. It's thoroughly depressing.The show's reality makes this one totally worth seeing, and I recommend it to those who want a serious anime. That said, don't view this while depressed."
3,Not as good as I thought it was.,"Been with the computer industry for 10 years, ever since the 386's back in the 80's. Finally decide to take the stupid exams. Bought this book because it seemed informative. Took it back for refund after 10 days. You could probably pass it with this book, but if you're an old wiz, who needs everything to be clear and precise, don't bother with it. It's too simple in both the Core and OS areas. To be truthful, I haven't taken the exam yet, but I with my experience in the computer field, this book is too simple. I would recommend something else for those new to this field. About the software that's included, I guess it's okay. Their website didn't seem to be up on March 2, 2001. Haven't tried the site on later dates yet. Well hope this was helpful to those who's looking for A+ books."
1,did not work,"Although this was the charger listed for our camera, it did not charge the battery (and we had two batteries-neither was charged)...Figured it was not worth the time and trouble to send it back. It was a neat little charger ... too bad it did not do anything but look pretty."
4,"Well Researched, Entertaining, somewhat Biased","I'd have to say that this is one of the best biographies available on Hancock (a close second to Glenn Tucker's ""Hancock the Superb""). It's well written, and thoroughly researched from reliable sources. I can't give a full five stars because like most biographies written on Hancock, it is somewhat biased. Jordan has given a concise record of the General's life but apparently refrained from drawing conclusions when it came to Hancock's personality and character, which can leave a reader unfamiliar with other mediums on Hancock, wanting. Which is understandable when his resources gives little reference to his personality without being completely biased with praise. With all that aside, it still is an excellent account of Gen. Hancock's life an belongs on the shelf of every Civil War buff."
2,A well-written trifle.,"This book was very much a disappointment both in its attempt to exonerate attorney Sheila McGough and in its weak attempt to make some larger points about the law and lawyers in general. Janet Malcolm is an excellent writer and there are some nice pithy aphorisms in the book. Unfortunately, this short book does not go into enough depth to resolve Ms. McGough's guilt or innocence. In essence, the reader is asked to trust Ms. Malcolm's instincts as to who the con artists were in the story she describes. I would pass on this book as it resolves and illuminates nothing."
2,A Frustrating Book,"There was a good book in here somewhere, but I found the author's point of view toward the main charachter frustrating. Either offer more analysis of her poor decisions or tell us some more facts to make the reader more sympathetic to the lawyer. But the way the author left it, I felt the lawyer seemed unsympathetic and some of her actions without enough explanaton/justification/analysis to give teh reader some perspective.The story is somewhat interesting, which manages to carry the book, but the writing left me wanting more."
3,"Interesting, Malcolm is brilliant as always","Janet Malcolm is such a superb writer, that it is impossible to truly dislike any of her work. This book, though, lacked for me, the humanity that most of her books are full off, and it might be only due to the subject matter. Her observations are magnificent, though...."
2,Good writing; drab reading,"Honestly, I did not even waste time finishing this book (short as it is). I enjoy true crime, social commentary through true crime etc. Certainly, the book was well written, but there just wasn't much to it! An unremarkable story and an unremarkable book. Don't waste your time."
2,Not as good as her typical work,"The idea of the book was intriguing (truth rests not on objective standards but on competing narratives and our evaluation of the plausibility of those narratives), but unfortunately, Malcolm chose a dreadful way to demonstrate it. As she noted repeatedly, none of McGough's legal contacts had much interest in her story, and Malcolm did not succeed in making me care, either about McGough or the issues at hand--an ironic case of hoist on your own petard."
1,Thoroughly Biased Writing By a Fine Author,"Having been interviewed by Ms Malcomb for this book, given that I was personally responsible for the plight of her protagonist, I can say with certainty that she has really missed the truth of this matter. I have read and like a number of her other works, but this book simply ignores by omission the fact that Sheila McGough went to jail for very good reasons. There were many others who were defrauded by her, and it is no fluke or prejudice of our system--as Ms Malcomb avers--that she was found guilty.For a fine author to have been hoodwinked by Ms McGough shows how good she really was at getting other people's money for her criminal boyfriend. This would only be qualified as bad journalism were it an article, although it may be well written. On this case, however, Ms Malcomb just got it wrong--and in a book which is suppposedly relating a true story this is unacceptable."
1,Salvation Blvd.,What a stupid movie! Not only didn't I like it but my parts in it (I was an extra) were cut. Plus it was in litigation so long (for what I don't understand) that I was doubly bummed when I watched it.
2,Just Not Funny,"Rule number one of comedy is broken. The top notch cast all bring their A game but the script simply ties their hands behind their backs. This is the first time I have found Jim Gaffigan ""unfunny."" I admit to being mildly amused at some of the mega church ""isms"" but not at the 3rd rate murder, greed, lust, and conspiracy bologna slices they throw at the wall."
2,don't waste your time,"I understand 'Hollywood' doesn't like Christians, but trying to make a movie to put them all in a bad light is just dumb. The writer is a proclaimed atheist and wants others to think the same. Again, don't waste your time."
1,This movie was terrible,This movie was terrible. The acting was not good and the story was so stupid I could not bare it! They may have thought they were producing a comedy but failed terribly! I feel like I threw away my money!
3,An ok Book,"This book was pretty good I guess. when Carole figures out Marie is saying with her she is very happy. But since Marie gets all the attention,Carole is jealous.I wouldnt blame her!Anyway its a pretty good book!"
3,Good but not one of the best,I only paid a couple dollars so I basically got what I paid for. There are better drinking song CD's out there. But its not bad.
5,Little boy big voice.,"I loved this cd. Michael has a very powerful voice, not just for someone so young, but for any singer. I have three vehicles and this cd is in everyone of them.If you like a strong, clear, powerful voice and good music you won't be disappointed."
5,"SUPER GOOD, SUPER HOOD!",MERCILESS HAS A GREAT DELIVERY AND GREAT LYRICS. AND HE HAS THE VERY OWN KING OF SPANISH HIP HOP/RAP PRODUCTIONS HAPPY PEREZ ON THE WHOLE THING. SO ITS JUST PLAIN FIRE! THE CDZ GREAT. GET IT.
4,Not Gluten Free!!! Celiac's beware,"Product is cut with a wheat base so if you are wheat sensitive or have a wheat allergy this might not work for you. Only a dash is used when flavoring foods so it might not upset you but I think people should be advised. This product stinks like no other...WHEW...could smell it through the shipping package! If you get this on your hands prepare for the smell to linger. I usually put my seasonings in my palm to measure but I will have to adjust that method when using this product. As a person with an onion allergy I am very excited to have this in my spice cupboard! I miss onion flavor and this does the trick. Don't add too much or your food will take on a sulfurous taste. I keep mine in a ziplock to help with the odor, very, very pungent...but that's how you know it's good right? Enjoy"
4,LeadTek WinFast TV2000 XP VERY GOOD but NOT PERFECT!,"This LeadTek WinFast TV2000 XP installed very easily.When you press the TV button on the remote control it takes a few seconds for the TV software to startup.The one button Record feature is easy to use but does have a few second recording delay.The remote does operate good at a distance.The Bad: When paying back the videos, there is an out of sync condition between the audio and video.The splash screen is irritating. The Remote control sensor does not stick to any surface.This model did not have the FM Tuner. It would have been nice to have FM.The buttons on the remote control need to be a lot larger, especially if you have large hands.The software control panel buttons are not clearly labeled."
3,"Works in Windows 98, but not with supplied drivers and PVR software","I bought this item because I wanted to watch a little TV on my Windows 98 computer circa 2000. I was able to get it to work, but not with Leadtek's drivers (updated drivers on their website made my computer lock up). I downloaded generic Conextent drivers somewhere and it took. I also use K!TV freeware tv software.On the plus side, it works reasonably well for an old computer with meager RAM, decent picture for analog, didn't have to buy a bunch of extra stuff.On the negative side, the installation was a major headache."
3,"Good Picture, but ....","Picture and software work well. A good value. However, this model requires a plug-in on the motherboard that my Dimension 8400 does not have.Tried to contact manufacturer multiple times and got no response on how I might work around the problem. Dell wasn't much help either.So, make sure you have the required audio recpticle on you motherboard before you order this. Otherwise, it is a nice TV card."
1,Not even 1 star,"One star is too good for this. I've installed and used a number of TV cards before, all working perfectly. This one however did not. To makes matters more frustrating, there were not trouble shooting guide lines what so ever!!!!!! Don't be a fool and purchase this product."
4,an other,"Excellent useful book and well written, we have changed much of our travel planning for the better since reading, highly recommend"
5,THE book for planning your next trip!,"I LOVE this book!!---especially the illustrations that show how to choose versatile clothing items that can be recombined into multiple outfits. They really helped me to visualize all the possiblilities, so I could pack fewer clothes and still feel I was wearing ""something different"" every day of my trip. And there's no better way to lift my spirits on a dreary day than to leaf through the section on ""packing for a cruise"" and daydream about taking a wonderful vacation. If you only buy one book about traveling this year, make it this one!"
5,Never too well-traveled to learn new tips!,"I am an experienced traveler, yet I learned many new tips from this book to make packing for travel so much easier; especially in this new era of packing light. It's filled with the basics for my less-traveled friends who ask me for advice - I just tell them ""buy this book"" and you're set! A big PLUS - the extensive illustrations - if you're in a hurry one picture is worth a thousand words - or a thousand miles."
2,Tells you what you probably already know.,"I have travelled a little, and I found this book really just stated the obvious. For example, she tells the reader to find out what the weather will be like in the place he/she is visiting in order to choose the right clothes. Half way through the book I was still hoping to find some new information I could use. There are a few handy tips for space-planning and access convenience, but overall, not the resource I was hoping for."
4,Good layout,"GOod ideas in the book, but somehow the style of the drawings appear to be very old fashioned. I loved the gadget and travel tip boxes that are all over the book. The tricks for packing different types of bags are excellent."
2,Boring! Money Waster!,"I suggest you look at other software before purchasing this Hoyle product. Although the colors are nice and vivid, the games are a little boring, there's no action, or special effects. I don't get that ""I'm at the casino"" feeling with this game."
2,Midnight Gambler Loves Double Diamond,"I have bought several cds of slots, and I can tell you that none of the ones I've been able to get here in Canada match up to the old red, white, and blue (sevens), the double diamond, cherry fever, etc. I have tried to get Slots and Slots II, which have my favorite games, Hoyle Slots which has some, but no, we can't get them here. Even the Casinos up here are changing, and I'm bored with their choices, so yeah, Hoyle Slots and Video Poker would give me some relief from my agony!!"
4,Comprehensive look at a Rock icon...,"Excellent account of Hendrix's life (drug use and all) with the only critique that I might add is how can Henderson know or even speculate what thoughts went through Hendrix's mind particularly when he lay dying? There is a lot of this type of verbage here, but if you can get around that, this is an invaluable story that definetly puts you into Hendrix's life (a big strongpoint of this book) particularly during the major events (Monterey, Fillmore, Woodstock...) and is well worth the read."
1,horrible book,This is a terrible book and it came at the very last minute and the book wasn't even worth reading. I have read many biographies about Hendrix and this one was the worst so far.
5,"adelante, please move foward","brilliant... found it in paris years ago.... everyone who hears it , loves it. Cubano, reggae, jazz melange produced by Carlos Bess of Wu tang clan. Ky Mani Marley is great."
3,Very Basic,"Written with ""The Goal"" in mind - this book on DFSS is a very general, very light overview of the DFSS approach using the story approach. It reads fast and like a novel, with the protagonist suffering career angst, and discovering DFSS as an elixr to reenergize him. If you are looking for a easy read and very introductory book on DFSS, this would be a decent choice. Don't expect to walk away an expert, but you may walk away a little smarter."
1,Oh no not again,"This book is as silly and stupid as his last DFSS book ""Design for Six Sigma"". Don't buy it, don't borrow it! If you are looking for a serious book try ""Design for Six Sigma: Innovation for Enhanced Competitiveness "" by Gregory Watson instead."
4,Zig Zag is a great recording!,The other is pretty forgettable. I'm a longtime fan of them and Zig Zag holds up better than virtually every studio CD. Great blues edge.
4,keeps cool,This works very well in keeping pre-chilled wines cool/cold. It's great for taking a bottle to friend's house or to your favorite restaurant. Travel time and or waiting time not an issue as the chiller maintains the ready to drink temperature.
5,Better than an ice bucket!,"I have used these Vacu Vin products for years with excellent results. They are neat, clean and practical. They store easily in less space and make great gifts."
2,Poor chilling,This product keeps a previously cold bottle. Do not expect it to chill anything. Maybe is something with the gel..is not reacting to get colder than ambient temperature
1,Not very good at chilling,Trying to chill a bottle of wine or champagne did not work successfullyWould not recommend it. Sorry about that
2,Linksys,I lose contact with the access point when I move my notebook more than 50' from it and always when I'm 100' away.
1,PURE [STUFF],This thing kinda worked for the first year that I owned it but I always had to reset it because it would die unexpectedly. I tried the firmware update but the software always died at 34%. I called their tech support and they told me that I shouldn't update the firmware and that it may damage the hardware.No kidding... then the guy tried to make me feel bad that the hardware was failing... Linksys tech support is a bunch of morons... don't buy this product.
2,Died on me after less than 4 months...,"Bought November 16th, died March 12th... Now I have to go through the painful return process.... Before that it was working great, and I thought bery highly of the product."
3,"Works, setup easy, but power cycle often needed","I have one, set up in Wep 128, access by various devices (DLink DWL 120, DWL 500, DCF 650W). Setup is pretty easy using the USB interface and the provided software (including firmware updates..). I get about 500KBytes/s bandwith with strong signal.Cons:- it doesn't seem to work more than 24h... Either the network stops working, or it becomes slow (e.g. 35KBytes/s). Power cycle and it works again."
4,Work fine with Windows 2000,"I first bought this thinking that it's going to take awhile to get this to work. I bought this plus WPC11 from Amazon. I also got an Orinoco PC card silver from another vendor (...)Anyway, the entire setup including unpacking the box and installing the software took only 4 minutes. I was able to surf the Internet and browse my local network.I'm running Windows 2000. USB runs fine. Pop the Orinoco card in, install the driver, and change SSID, Done. I was up and running with both PC card on two different laptops running Windows 2000 in under 10 min.The manual looks a little scary and confusing. So I didn't bother with it. I was able to do the entire install and setup without the manual.I have not try the range test yet, but sharing the hub (within couple offices on the same floor,) the speed and connection seems to be fine. Good luck."
4,Slow but reliable,This linksys product has worked for me reliably under a variety of conditions. I would recommend these units to anyone trying to make a short range wireless bridge or a wifi hotspot.
2,Good technology but bad software,"The Linksys WAP11 appears to be built on solid technology, however the software it comes with leaves much to be desired. The configurations don't make sense, and the documentation doesn't make sense, even to a seasoned computer and network engineer such as myself.The security settings are done half-hazardly, and it is very hard to get this WAP to work using its maximum security settings, even with Linksys' own pc cards!Linksys tech support seems to be vaguely aware of the fact that the configuration software comes broken, and they have very few answers.Bottom line, I'd say this would be ok for a home, barely workable in a small office (be prepared to tinker with the broken configuration software for hours), DEFINATELY not ready for enterprise usage."
5,Works great; range as expected.,"I bought the WAP11 v2.2 from Amazon about three weeks ago. I had it installed and working in about an hour, most of the time was caused by mistyping my SSID. Once I corrected that, everything worked flawlessly. Encryption took another five minutes to setup. The range is about what I expected. I have a usable range of about 120 feet but this is through several walls. I used a netgear ma401 card as the client."
2,"Final Update to ""Free at Last!""","I had a Linksys WAP11 die on me after 14 months. I had always been happy with it ... so I immediately ordered a replacement. It turned out to be the new v2.2.The Linksys v2.2 wouldn't work reliably when WEP was enabled (neither 64 nor 128 bit). Also, I seemed to have much more trouble with signal strength. So I tried a second one assuming the first was defective, but the with the same results.So I gave up on the Linksys WAP11 v2.2 and tried the SMC2655W (even though it's supposedly based on the same electronics) and guess what? It not only worked flawlessly with WEP enabled, but it gave a stronger signal, and is about half the size of the WAP11.I DID get the WAP11 v2.2 to work well, though not as strong as the SMC, if I disabled WEP. Looks to me like a move in the wrong direction for Linksys."
4,linksys wireless home network,"Bought Linksys wireless access point and PCI cards. All Linksys products worked right out of the box. Virtually no installation was required. However, the effective indoor range of the wireless access point is more like 50-70 ft not anywhere near the claimed maximums. My guess is that to get these maximums there must be a clear line of sight between the wireless access point and the PCI cards. However, the indoor range is adequate for the average home. Am using in conjunction with Linksys router and telocity dsl gateway. Again, the router is a delight with no installation required other than plugging it in"
1,No More Linksys,"In years before Cisco purchased Linksys, I was a loyal customer. Since then things have changed. Poor quality (I too have gone through 2 WAP-11's in less than four years), Poor support: Long hold times, out-sourced to another country and a seeming lack of focus on model design and direction (have a look at the number of WAP-11 firmware revs's and sub models and lack of firmware upgrade paths)I'm all done. I'll be over at Netgear."
2,Great...until it broke down,Pros:1. Easy setup.2. Pretty good range.Cons:1. Broke after 1 year warranty ended.2. Canned responses from tech support.3. 1 year warranty.This has taught me a good lesson. Don't ignore the warrantythe manufacturer offers. Seek out one that offers at least a3 year warranty. I know I will on my next WAP.
2,at least it looks nice,"I am very dissapointed with MY WAP11. The manual does not realy give any procedures for setting up the unit. Tech support, what a joke. My first call to tech support a guy answered the phone and took my number, and promised a return call...it's been 4 days so far no call. I called back and after 8 minutes on hold, I was cut off. When I finally got a support person, he seemed very put out to talk to me - even yawned once. Sounded like he thought I was an idiot. No real progress on my problem.. I have to shut down the unit every few times i use it.. the range on the unit is about 25 feet so far...good luck & save your recipt."
4,Update to my review,I spoke with another individual that was having the same issue I was with the NAP WAP11 from Linksys. He has changed from the Linksys PC Card to an Orinoco PC Card and is getting much better results. So the issue with distance in this case would be traced to the PC Card from Linksys.
3,Intermittent connectivity problems with WIFI,"I've endured intermittent WIFI connectivity problems with the Linksys WAP11 access point. The UI provided for tweaking settings is pretty cool, but it could use some refinements. I recommend checking out comments from other reviewers before buying this specific model."
3,power boost trick doesn't work with new version (WAP11 v2.2),"An earlier review below talks about boosting the output power by playing with an undocumented setting. This only works for the old model. The new one, WAP11 v2.2, is completely different; there is no known way to make it output more power.--Pat / zippy at cs.brandeis.edu"
5,Good product,"We have rolled out our Wireless network option at our company, using 5 of the Linksys Instant Wireless Network Access Points. The setup was very simple and quick. Connectivity to the Wireless PC Cards was very easy to setup, also. We are going to add one more access point to make sure our entire floor is covered. One of the access points was bad and we are in the process of getting that replaced.My only complaints are these: 1st- The range isn't all that Linksys touts, more like 30 - 40 feet indoors. 2nd- Talking with their Tech Support is difficult as you have to leave a message and then they will call you back. My first call took two days before I heard back from them. They are more responsive through E-mail, but I don't always like to do tech support that way."
3,Linksys WAP11 review,"I bought it, thinking that I could plug it directly into my cable modem, but soon found that it really expects you to have something that does NAT so that you can easily assign the I/P addresses yourself. So I ended up buying their linksys Cable/DSL router, which made everything work fine. I found the documentation lowsy, it took me quite a while to figure out what options I needed to set on the wireless card (on my laptop) to work with the base-station. Other than that, the product is largely working as advertised with the exception that it sure doesnt feel like 11Mb/sec."
3,no powerlines,could u tell me how can i get the powerline for it? i cannot use it if not the power supply
2,Not all its cracked up to be.,"Ultimately, I ended up throwing this WAP away after it stopped functioning. You are far better off spending the extra money for an 802.11g WAP (54 Mbps versus 11 Mbps).Unlike other WAPs, this device can connect to another WAP and act as a bridge. If you have two Ethernet networks and want to connect them, it is relatively painless with this device. That was my original rationalization for buying this product. Turns out I never really needed the extra functionality.I was never impressed with the 10 Mbps speed. The first time around setup was painless. However, reinstalling the software under XP became problematic. The USB driver/software from Linksys caused my Windows XP machine to blue-screen and crash. It caused my Windows ME system to hang periodically.I would recommend you pass on this product and get an 802.11g WAP. They are faster (54/100+Mbps) AND backwards compatible with your existing 802.11b network cards."
2,Stopped working after 4 months,"Initial setup was nice, particularly compared to D-Link, (the tech decided the D-Link was broken). But I came home from vacation and its not sending out a signal anymore. The WAP11 connects to the LAN fine, but none of the laptops are getting any signalfrom it. Tech support was laughably inept. Now I've figured out the reset button doesn't actually do anything. They want me to upgrade firmware a third time. DSL Reports.com says there's a problem with the latest firmware. I wish I could buy one of these things and it would just work."
4,Limited life expectancy,"This is the second WAP11 I have owned. I love their out of the box connectivity. it only took me ten minutes to get going wirelessly. the speeds are definitly compareable to wired LAN speeds. the only thing I don't like is their tendancy to DIE!! their life expectancy is 1 1/2 years of full time use. by that I mean in a normal house where you leave it plugged in all the time and use it when ever you want. IF you buy this product don't expect to get more than a year and a half out of it and you will go away satisfied that you got your moneys worth. Im thinking of upgrading to the 54G network now that my WAP11 is dead, but Im not sure if Ill use a Linksys product to do it with."
1,Beware - Poor Performance,"I bought two of these units to bridge an existing Ethernet because of their attractive price and flexibility.However, I could not get the units to communicate faster than 500 kbit/sec in either bridging mode or AP mode. This is with both units 3 feet apart in the same room, with all other wireless devices powered off. This is far below their rating of 11 mbit/sec and much worse than the 4 mbit/sec I get in a similar setup with my Orinoco gear.After an unfruitful 1 hour session with Linksys tech support ended with them blaming the wretched performance on ""microwave oven or air traffic control tower interference"" I returned the units."
3,It works...with problems,"Basically the product works, and works nicely. However, the manual is unreliable and misleading in some places.The software and firmware are buggy as well. For example, the SNMP management utility requires a password to manage the device - but the current version of the firmware (1.4i.1) does not accept the password shown in the manual, nor the one suggested to me by customer service. So the SNMP utility is unuseable until the next firmware upgrade, which is a shame because some features are only accessible through the SNMP utility.Also, one of the advertised features is misleading. They say the device has hardware support for 128-bit WEP - they don't tell you that firmware prior to 1.4i.1 only supported 64-bit WEP. 1.4i.1 is the currently shipping version of the firmware, however, so if you buy now you should be OK.My experience with customer service has been good overall."
2,Wait for version 2 of WAP11 and WPC11,"I'm finding the rating from other reviews of this product a little inflated. Wireless products from other companies must be really bad if someone would rate these products with 5 stars. These products, or at least one of them, in no way meets the documented specifications of 11Mbps for 150m indoors. More like 0Mbps in 30m indoors. Were not talking indoors of the Superdome from the 50 yard line are we Linksys? Don't state your product works to a certain standard if it doesn't. If you need a serious wireless product then wait for version 2 or buy Cisco."
5,Works for me,"I bought the Linksys WAP11 after 1st trying (and returning) the D-link access point. I've seen some of the other reviews of the WAP11 that knock the ease of installation. I might just be lucky but it took me 10 minutes to get it up and running using the USB cable connected to my desktop computer and running the install software. After it was up I just unplugged the USB cable and three days later it's still working great. I'm writing this review in fact, on my laptop using the Lynksys wireless pc card. The range might not be what is clamed by Linksys but it works great for me. My house is 2300 sq ft, the WAP11 is in my office upstairs on the far end of my house and I am downstairs on the other end and it's working fine. DSL works just as fast on the laptop, wireless as it does on my desktop and the desktop is directly wired to the router. I can't say that this will work for everyone, but it does what I wanted it to do."
2,WAP11 Limited,"I am disappointed with this product. I bought an early release, in March 2001. I found the manual to be poor and the technical assistance poorer -- often I had to keep calling until I got lucky and I found someone who knew something. My access point is about 40 feet from my computer (although it is down one flight) and my connection is always weak. Recently, my connection has often been too weak to work and Linksys has not been able to give me any help diagnosing the problem."
3,"Not great, but servicable.","This access point certainly works, and it's a cheap way to get a wireless network going, but its embedded webserver for configuration is a piece of junk. Make sure you get the configuration right quickly so you don't have to deal with it again. Also, the configurator seems to work better with Windows than it does with Linux, which doesn't make any sense at all. Occasionally the whole AP will [not work] out and I have to unplug/replug it to get it working again.Linksys doesn't know anything about their own product. I was trying to connect an embedded system to a network and had some basic operational questions about the AP, and they were unable to answer. They were general knowledge questions, not requesting propritary information, so they should have been able to tell me."
5,No Worries Ever Again - I'm free!,"This is the best! I don't know much about computers at all, but I do know that I hate to mess with cables. So I bought expecting to invest a substantial chunk of time to install it.No worries! This thing set up so easily I didn't even have to call support for help. I did call up Linksys once for help on optimizing my speed, they called back in less than an hour and gave me the best tips on how I should arrange everything in my home to help the data transfer.My PC Cards are great, and now I can hook up my laptop from work every night, no problem. It's helped me out with saving time more than any PC product I've bought in a long time.I'm definitely recommending this to all of my friends, esp the ones with notebooks from work - it's a winner for sure."
2,overated range,"I give this product a two star because it is easy enough to set up. However, I've found the advertised indoor range is way overated. Could'nt get good connection more than 2 rooms away."
1,Periodically WAP11 v2.6 goes into outer space,"Works fine but several times per week it lost its mind as the firmware got lost. Sometimes returned on its own after a few minutes, sometimes requires reboot/restart, and once it never came back. Dealer replaced unit, which exhibited similar behavior. Apparently, just my guess, noise (RF, line, Ethernet) got interpreted as bad data and it gets lost trying to process it. New firmware (v 1.07) made it worse. Tech support is clueless, and one of them suggested using a competitors product: NetGear MR814. I have no doubt the WAP11 works well in a quiet environment. Version 2.8 is supposed to be better, they say...."
2,"OK, Just OK, not if you want customer support","For the price, I guess its good. but connectivity was very bad. I could not even a good signal strength in the next room. I had to reload the access point every day. Support (waiting on line for over 1 hour with them) told me I should upgrade the fimware, which I did. Then everything went crazy, Linksys would not retain my configuration or IP address. So I called support and they suggested another file. still same thing. so finally fed up and returned it and got a netgear mr314 (which was the same price as only a access point, on sale), which so far has no problems and gives better range. I go outside my house i stilll have signal."
2,Research before you buy,"Be sure you know exactly what you need before you buy when it comes to Linksys products. Just because it is ""wireless"" and conforms to the 801.11b standard, doesn't mean it's going to be compatible to other Linksys wireless products. If in doubt about a particular application, ask the Linksys helpline. It turns out this WAP will not communicate with my router. The lights on the front sure are pretty though!"
1,Won't Bridge,Don't believe the packaging and spec's. The new WAP 11 V2.2 will not operate as a client or multipoint access point. Don't waste your time trying to make it work - tech support from Linksys was no help as it took three calls to finally be told that the feature is planned for a future software release with no promised delivery date.
3,Don't even think about ...,"... using this with the WMP11 PCI card without upgrading the firmware first (on both of them!). Unless of course you would like a wild ride through hell during installation. Linksys support for their wireless products is near non-existent. I was on hold for more than 3 hours and then I gave up (good thing I have headset phone!). I tried again the next day waited on hold for 1 hour and then gave up. I was about to return the WAP11 and WMP11, when I decided to upgrade the firmware on the WMP11 (I had already upgraded the firmware on the WAP11). After the firmware upgrade and hours and hours of frustration, it worked! I have the WAP11 in my basement and my computer with the WMP11 on the main floor, I get 73% signal strength and link quality.The reason I bought the linksys WAP11 is because it supposedly features ""bridging"" between two access points. Whether it is supported or not is highly questionable after what I went through."
2,Low Performance,"Well, the performance decrease of 50% when using this product almost made me send it back. The customer support sent me over the top....it's non-existent, little help and hard to get hold of....Several others that I know have also since complained of the speed performance. Even if you disable the wireless acess the performance is very much impared when in use, as compared to being just attached to the cable modem directly.It was easy to install and get going. Not sure yet if it's worth the price."
1,total piece of crap,"I bought this thing and a Linksys wireless card as well, and set it up and configured it and everything setup perfectly without a hitch. However, the computers wouldn't connect. When I tested with a script that pinged the computers across the wireless connection I had 90% packet loss at 3 feet! When I moved the computer from the office to the living room I had 100% packet loss and 26 percent (""poor"") signal strength - only two rooms away!Email to technical support went totally unanswered.So I can only assume that this product is a joke and that linksys will put out a real product soon and apologize for ever shipping this thing. I'd give up on them completely if their DSL/Cable router wasn't such a great product."
1,Linksys WAP11 Instant Wireless Network Access Point,"Unlike my Linksys BEFSR41 Etherfast Cable/DSL Router, the WAP11 was difficult to set up [....] I could never get 128-bit encryption to work (also bought the WPC11 PC Card). My biggest complaint is that the maximum signal range that I got from the Linksys Wireless ""solution"" was about 30 feet through a single gypsum wallboard wall; nowhere close to the advertised distance of 164 feet at 11 Mbps indoors. I spent far too many hours moving the WAP around the house and switching channels attempting to achieve a more acceptable range. I wound up hard-wiring the rooms that I wanted access to and will probably wait for wireless network technology to mature a bit before attempting to have full mobility. [....]"
3,Disappointed in WAP11 2.2,"I wish I could say that my Linksys WAP11 v 2.2 is living up to my expectations. Setup is straight-forward ... but range a little limited. I purchased an additional unit to 'extend' my network, wirelessly, but have now found out that the 'access point client' operational mode does not work as advertised. It turns out that this unit is unable to extend a network wirelessly ... while still giving wireless clients full access along the way. The solution offered by Linksys tech support was to 1. hardwire the second access point or 2. purchase two additional units and a hub and have them 'bridge' to each other and then use the original two units to give client access. This is a pretty expensive solution for what now appears to be marketing hype. Bottom line: you get what you pay for and this unit is at the low end of the price range."
1,Disappointing,"Like most technology, started out promising. Then, gradually got flakier and flakier. Usable distance was never more than 20 feet, USB connectivity for config was problematic under Windows 2000/XP. Clueless (although free) phone technical support -- got what I paid for there..."
3,"Good For What it does, Bad Documentation",I was told by a Linksys Rep that this item can be used extend the range of my network. After wasting many hours with Technical people that did not know what they were taliking about I spoke to a level 2 technition who explained that the purpose of this device is to plug into a wired network and enable it to be wireless. What I needed was a range extender. I Did use it for my wired network at work and it does work for that purpose.
1,Problems with Windows XP,I've had lot of great success with Linksys products in the past. Unfortunately their wonderful track record has stopped with this product.Linksys claims that although the drivers have not been certified with Microsoft they will work on XP. My experience has been that the product WILL NOT work with XP.
3,Good I SUPPOSE,"Now this is the only wireless router i've had experience with so i don't know if this is a problem with all of them BUT, It does NOT share my dial up connection. And i wasn't even using the wireless part!!! You would think a 4 port switch could handle a dial up connection like my old 10 base T hub which I have switched back to for now untill i get broadband.The wireless file sharing worked fine. I shared some movies with a computer in another room with the wireless g pci adapter (also by linksys). That lasted all of a few hours because I NEED THE INTERNET.If all wireless routers can't share dial up then this is probably the best you can get but if it isn't someone needs to let me know. :("
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I was impressed at how easy it was to setup, but I was very dissappointed with it's range. I had it setup in a window facing the other building, 100 feet away. I had 90% signal strength at 50 feet, 60% signal strength at 100 feet (just outside the other building), and ZERO signal strength on the otherside of the wood stud wall. I repositioned the WAP11 in 3 locations...no luck. I have heard that the Linksys WPC11 PCMCIA (in my laptop) card is horrible when it come to walls...maybe that's the problem, except I also read on someone's website that they had opened the WAP11 and found a WPC11 card inside of it!!I hope they increase the power of this unit...until then, I'm returning this one.Good Luck"
2,Dead after 1 1/2 year,"Linksys WAP11 worked flawlessly for about 6 month, then it started to drop communication about every couple of days, then it just gradually gotten worse. Before it went completely dead on me, it was dropping communication with my PC about 1 minute after I reset the Access Point. All I could say is that I am not pleased with Linksys products since it is my second Linksys product that went out of commission shortly after the 1 year warranty. I am not sure if I'll buy another Linksys product, but I really like the fact that WRT54G has lots of third party support to add features to the factory build firmware. Naah...I won't give Linksys another chance."
5,Highly recommend this product - 5++ stars,I had my laptop connected to the linksys router via a 50 foot cable I strung up the stairs and through the hall. I purchased this WAP and removed the 50 foot cable. No problem setting up the WAP and I can walk through out the house and not be tied to a cable.
2,Not happy,"I cannot get the WAP to connect with a computer just 80 feet away. Granted, it is downstairs, diagonally opposite my office: however, I thought that ""indoors 150ft"" implied through walls. Not sure if changing the PCMCIA card will help, but I am willing to try.Installation was also difficult, particularly for a novice like me. I connected the WAP to the router and the router to the cable modem. It took me hours to figure out how to get each to talk to each other. Customer serviced was of no help - with either the distance issue or installation."
4,Not as strong as I thought it would be...,"I have the base unit in the addition to our house. The signal has to pass through an existing brick wall to reach any other area of the house. If it has to pass though any other wall (like a bedroom only 40 feet away), I lose the signal. I need to reconsider placement of the base I guess."
3,Works okay with Apple's Airport Card,"I got this for my Mac because Apple is charging twice as much for the base station. I set it up pretty quicky with a PC but it took me a few hours of researching online to figure out how to enter the WEP password in my Mac (dollar sign ""$"" plus ""Key 1"").The signal is good; it gives me good speed (I have dsl) throughout the house (3 levels).One Problem thus far: The signal seems to disappear if I don't use it for a long time (in the morning or when I came home from work). I have to restart it twice a day and it's annoying. I will exchange it this weekend and if the problem is fixed, I will post another review."
2,"Hokey setup, limited range -- not too great","I have the Linksys Cable/DSL router, which is an excellent product. I expected similar from their Wireless Access Point, but so far, I've been pretty disappointed.The setup was OK, but not nearly as nice as the web-based configuration on the Cable/DSL router. (PC Magazine actually praised their setup routine, so take my comments as you will.)In terms of range, I was VERY disappointed. I got good performance, until I moved my computer more than five or six feet from the box. I tried changing channels, repositioning the antennas, etc., but didn't have much better luck. (For reference, I was using Linksys' wireless PCMCIA card.)... I am going to play around a little bit more, but so far, I'm not too impressed."
2,Weak Signal,"The advertised signal strength is a little under a 1/4 mile outdoors. I set this up at my friends house who has DSL in his window so I could recieve DSL across the street at my house. the only thing that was an obstacle for the signal was the two windows it had to pass through, nothing else. Well, it didn't work, I walked from his house to mine with my laptop in my hands. The time I had reached the street on my friend's house drive way, I lost the signal. So I was a bit disappionted that the advertised signal distance was wrong. Other than that it works great, as long as you don't have to get a signal through concrete, steel or a 2nd story floor."
4,Great Wireless Access Point... Awful Lynksys website........,"I just purchased this access point as an addition of my wired network based on SMC Router. The product work like a charm. I hooked it up on my router, and put in the included CDROM in a computer under the same network, in 5 minites the access point is all set to go. This would worth 5 starts. But..........Now here is something you want to be aware of. I then go to the Linksys website and thought it might work better if I upgrade the firmware. The newest on the web is 1.01c while the firmware on my WAP11 is 1.01f. This is very strange but since it seems to be the newest on the web I thought I might as well give it a try. The Access Point stop working immediatly once the 1.01c is installed. I search the web and found that 1.01c is a non-working firmware! Luckely, I did backup the firmware and was able to get it back to 1.01f! Amazon sell the one with the newest firmware, DO NOT USE THE ""NEWEST"" FIRMWARE ON LINKSYS'S WEBSITE!"
1,"Linksys WAP11, Limited Range","I configured this wireless access point on a 3-Com cable modem, along with its companion Linksys WPC11 card in an IBM i1400 Thinkpad laptop. The WPC11 PC card caused many problems in setup and operation of the laptop. When I did get everything running the range was limited to about 20 feet (line of sight, no obstructions). This is far below the published specifications. Technical support from Linksys was essentially unavailable. I returned both products as unacceptable."
4,Good performance at a great price,"Have a wired Ethernet running off my DSL line using a Cisco router and a 3com 8-port 10/100 Ethernet hub. Just plugged the WAP11 into a port on the hub, assigned it an IP address using the configuration utility, slapped the Linksys PCMCIA wireless card into my laptop, configured it, and was up and running -- all within 10 minutes. Performance has been average to good so far. If I get more than 30 feet away with more than a couple of walls in between, the connection becomes very spotty, though throughput has never fallen below the 640K of the DSL line. Don't know what effect enabling the 40bit encryption would have on throughput, though. Summary: Despite lower than expected range, the WAP11 is offered for a great price so I recommend it if you understand Ethernet configuration and your house is not too big."
1,Not recommended.,"I bought this book as a part of my PE exam preparation. After finishing the exam with some friends, we were so frustrated that many problems in the book were given with wrong answers. One of my friends who failed the exam once commented that it did not reflect the real exams. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It seemed to be hastily written."
1,Inadequate,"Please see my review of the 3-book series in which this book is typically purchased in the reviews of ""Surveying Principles for Civil Engineers."""
5,Perfect height for optimal listening!!!!!!!,"I've bought many of these, aand evertime I do, I'm just as happy as my first set. Great deal, great product....."
1,Poor construction and unstable,"For my purchase, the spot welds that held together the center screw receiver came undone at the top of the pole and this actually injured my speaker when it all gave way. Otherwise these stands seem unstable unless your speakers are very light. I wouldn't recommend these, especially when for a few dollars more you can have something better."
4,Very solid stands,"This is my second set of Sanus speaker stands, and have been happy with both of them. Sturdy and well built. The only things that prevented them from getting 5 stars are the price -- which I think is a bit on the high side -- and the fact that the top plate is too small. These were designed to handle some fairly large/heavy speakers, yet the plate is a mere 5""x5"". For this price Sanus should either have a larger top plate, or include several different sizes in the box."
1,Circuit Analysis Fail,"This is one of the worst textbooks I've ever had. My main beef is the examples are very simplistic, and do not even approach the complexity of the actual homework problems. The writing is at times unclear, and the pictures and diagrams are ugly and utilitarian. If you have troubles falling asleep at night, get this book!"
3,"Enjoyable, as well as the fourth anime I saw","Ayane's High Kick was the fourth anime I ever saw, and the third anime DvD I bought (I now have over 150.) It was an impulse buy, and the first time I watched it I was disapointed. Well, then I saw it again, and I found it much more entertaining. It has cute characters and good fights. I'm glad I bought it!"
3,Nothing new in this story,"Maybe I've just been watching anime for too long, but it seemed to me that most of this story was ""borrowed"" from other videos I've already seen."
4,"great for all ages, but expect sequals","Although the movie can be racey, and a little funny at time the ending was a little, well... lame. It leaves the viewer interested to find out what happens later in this career of kick boxing. That's why I say expect sequals, other than that it wasn't bad at all in the slightest."
3,A semi-Rocky type movie,"Ayane, a young high school girl is desperate to become a professional wrestler in the women's wrestling association. After failing her audition, she is taken in by a mysterious trainer who offers to train her for free. Ayane realizes during her first bout that all along she was training to be a kick boxer. Not just any ordinary kick boxer, but the master of the ""Golden High Kick."" A very fun sports movie that any Rocky fan will enjoy."
5,Never Met A Girl Like This,Although the animation can look a bit aged at times it never stops you from enjoying this series. Baki the grappler and Ayane do resemble each other but there are some differences that give Ayane a much more interesting story. For one Ayane starts out with no fighting skills but her semi athletic body assures her potential to be a professional wrestler. A lot of people want to throw a wrench into Ayane's plans to dominate wrestling except for her friend and trainer. Ayane's high kick is full of tough girls that will fight to their very last breath to win. There's tons of cool action and an even better story but who knows what's next for her.
4,"Cute Characters, OK Plot","The characters in this movie are done well and are very cute. But I agree with the other reveiws in stating that the plot was somewhat ""borrowed"". If you like cute girls who really kick butt, then you will definately like this movie. I would wacth it again, but I'd rather see the next one first."
1,Keep your Money,"If your looking for good Anime with lots of action and great fight scenes, DON'T LOOK HERE. The few, exuse me, TWO fight scenes this movie has are lame. You'd find more action in a Pokemon movie.I like my Anime filled with lots of action, some blood, and good story telling. ""fun filled anime, with lots of comedy""; Don't believe the hype. I wouldn't punish my family by making them sit through this ...."
2,Deceiving...........,"The photo does not show that all 3 bowls (yes, 3, not 6. When they said 6-piece set, they counted the lids one piece each.) have a metal rim on top. There's no comment saying these bowls are NOT microwaveable. Yes, they are ""pretty"", but now I have to rethink what I can use them for."
1,This perfume is original???,"I have my doubts if this perfume you sent me is originated, please tell me. how I can check the veracity of this article?"
3,"It is an ok smell, but there is better for the price","Nothing special, smells OK, but no attraction factor, it also lasts for a very short time. Smell is gone probably within 30 minutes. Got it as a gift, but would not pay this money for it. There are much better choices for the price. This one you are just paying for the name."
3,Nice Scent But A Bit Overwhelming,"Hello, A friend recently gave a bottle with a bit left it(about 2 weeks or so worth of spray-age) at first I loved the smell but after 20 minutes or so I couldn't stand the smell, I couldn't wait to get home and change out of my shirt. Got a few complaints about that ""too strong smell"" from the ladies and even a male friend. :(It's a great scent but I found way to overwhelming. I'll stick to my Armani Code."
2,"Not Happy: Think twice buying this item, at least from this seller","I have purchased this cologne couple weeks ago based on reviewes in amazon;make me totally upset. Even you spray more than an adequate amount, just disappearsafter 5-10 mins. Just a nice example of an expired cologne and I am just like anclassic example of ""effect of buying materials not before testing it""AMAZON should find out something to keep customers free from this issues."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I now understand why this book is still available so cheaply; I'm sorry I wasted $10 on it.I was hoping it would be an insightful commentary on Crowley's writing; however, what it is mostly is a collection of works by Crowley that Michaelsen feels are important. Each section is preceded by an ""essay"" by Michaelsen which amounts to little more than excerpts from Crowley strung together in a confusing way; he doesn't really contribute anything that would help a person understand Crowley better. His use of parentheses is so extensive it makes me wonder why he didn't just put everything in parentheses and be done with it. He also makes liberal use of footnotes which are at the end of the essay, so you have to keep flipping back and forth. It's illustrated with black & white photos but there's nothing new, all the usual suspects. All in all, poorly done and disappointing."
3,ware underrated overlooked classic r&b performer,"mikki bleu has a easy listenning voice and some catchy tunes(rythme and beats)also some pretty descent lyrics. i enjoyed the cd, but i last it and now im trying to reclaim it."
2,Waste of Money,"I have another DVD from Tracey that also offered three options. The upper body option was decent for days you want something quick and efficient. The lower body option was boring and not effective. I decided to give this a chance thinking it would be similar to her previous workout but more of a challenge. It wasn't, in fact, it was less challenging and very annoying. If you are brand new to exercise this might be for you. Just do it on mute, because they repeat the same phrases throughout the entire workout for all three tracks and the same excerices for four rounds."
1,Very practique memory,128 mb it is not much.. but it is very usefully.. when you need to save or just bring your files.. please if you continue using such things.. what is the name?? diskets?? you are totally mad.. you should just buy this memory and conect to the tecnology!! of course more mg is better.. but to start 128 is enough!!The Mate USB Flash Pen Drive is very nice and its size is just perfect.
1,Stopped working alittle short of ONE year. Class Action Suit!,"I loved this product when I first bought it. It linked our entire house including 2 TIVOs, a MAC, and 2 laptops. The signal would occasionally go out and we would unplug it and restart it and it was back up. Unfortunately, it slowly happened more and more often. To the point that in midstream of transferring shows from TIVO to TIVO, it would just die. Now, I have called support several times and they try to be helpful but it can get very frustrating quickly! Today, I went to the Belkin site to see if we could give it one more try and found out that there is a class action lawsuit and I can get a full refund on the product since I have the receipt. So, be forewarned before buying this product."
3,Kind of Cheesy,"Wow, I am a new catholic convert and really wanted to like this DVD for my 4 yr old daughter but just can't tell a lie...it's not great. The adult leader of the rosary exercises is a rather strange woman who dresses inappropriately and wears a lot of make-up. Why they didn't get a nice Nun to do this I surely don't know. The method of instruction (if you can even say there is one) is not effective and my child has no idea how to pray the rosary after watching this. I'm really sorry folks. To their credit, the sections of the DVD that show classic religious art combined with music is wonderful."
2,Questionable quality,"At first, these fit well and felt comfortable, but did a lot of shedding of black fuzz. The black fuzz looks bad on light carpet and gets all over bed sheets. I washed them to see whether the shedding would stop. Washing did reduce the shedding, but it did not stop -- and the comfort was gone."
2,Memory foam? I don't think so...,"Initially, these were the most comfortable slippers I've owned. However, after five days of use, the so-called 'memory foam' insoles are now flat and hard. If these slippers were made with real memory foam I suspect the insoles would have remained soft and cushy for at least a couple of months. But five days? Not good. The main positive is that the upper part of the slipper that covers the foot remains comfortable. For buyers purchasing these slippers online, I agree with other reviewers that they run a bit small. I wear a 10.5 shoe but needed the 11-12 size for a comfortable fit."
4,Great slippers for Nonno,These are great slippers for my dad who is 93. They have a medium sole so that he doesn't have any fear of slipping or sliding on hardwood or linoleum floors. He says they are very comfortable and warm.
3,"+1/2 star: good, but not the best","These slippers by Totes start out feeling a bit too tight, but they do stretch a bit--still, you may want to order one size up just to be sure your feet will be comfortable in these! The feel of the outside ""micro terry"" fabric is great but the quality of the sole is only fair; but then again I bought these to wear when visiting friends for the weekend or to use if I wind up in some hospital as I did a few weeks ago when I had both pneumonia and bronchitis! These slippers will be infinitely better than walking on a hospital floor in my socks.Overall, these are not the best slippers I've ever purchased; if you really want good quality I recommend you keep searching. I use these only occasionally so I think they're good enough for what I want."
4,Review of tote slippers,"Good quality and exactly what my husband wanted. Also, I was able to order the color Navy, which is not always readily available in department stores."
4,As advertised.,I wear these almost everyday. I do wish they came is half sizes. 10 was too small and 11 was too big.
4,"comfy, but wide","It is evidently expected that all men should buy slippers at Christmas. I couldn't even find many stores carrying them in September. There were only low quality ones in a few stores. So I was thrilled to find these for my husband. They are very comfortable and we can throw them into the washing machine. However, they are very wide and it is hard to walk without them falling off. So he shuffles around. If you have a wide foot, they'd be perfect."
3,Really comfortable but make your feet stink.,"I really like these slippers in terms of how comfortable they are but, the drawback of then is that they make your feet stink really awful. No joke. I have had these slippers for few months now and it seems like it's getting worse. And it doesn't happen with my other shoes so I have no recourse but to believe it's the slippers. Too bad cause they are comfy as can be!"
1,Did not fit my UU610,"I bought this item for my 3 year old UU610 (Hitachi but made by TracRac). The item is different than the item pictureds. It does not have the bended metal. The holes in the mounting plate do no match the holes on the ends of my UU610. More over, because the wheels overlie the mounting holes, they would get in the way of the support beams and accessories. I compared the part number and it is indeed the same, but this item looks like it was made for some other stand completely--maybe the UU610CZ (similar looking but smaller). It did say ""warranty part"" on the box and did not have any instructions. Also, it only came with two mounting bolts despite the pictured kit having 4. Too bad, the pictured kit looks like it would fit my stand exactly. The mounting holes on this one are just too narrow."
1,"BEWARE, IT DOES NOT FIT!!!","Unless Amazon can assure you that they have replaced their part 726215 they are shipping, with the wheel kit shown, you are wasting your time. The one Wu and I got is not the one pictured and does not fit. Because of his comments, I blitzed Amazon about it before ordering, and got a polite but lame third-world reply saying they could not check to make sure it was the one pictured. I thought they must have listened to him and corrected the problem but no. Even if you were to drill new holes, it would be hard to make it miss the sliders. Not the way to run a business. What are you doing to earn your keep, CS?"
1,Wrong part for the uu610 miter saw stand,This wheel kit in no way is the proper kit for the uu610 stand. With much reworking it might be made to work but it is not worth theeffort or time. The price should have been a clue since the price shown with the accessory sheet for the stand was almost half the price of the one Amazon sent me. Do not buy this part for your uu610!!
2,Hitachi 726215 Wheel Kit for UU610 Miter Saw Stand,"First of all, the wheel kit that showed up here looks nothing like the one pictured here. None of the bolt holes line up,so the only way that it will fit is to elongate existing holes,which tells me this wheel kit is not for my stand. Also no paperwork at all. Are you people on drugs?"
4,The sequel syndicated TV series of Tales From the Darkside,"This video contains 2 episodes from the syndicated horror TV series ""Monsters"" which aired in the late 80's. The show was pretty cheezy, but had a few scares. Soupy Sales stars in the episode ""The Farmer's Daughter""."
5,Its the best!,If you're looking for a nail brush that does the job this is it. It will probably last for years too. The bristles are soft enough to be comfortable while hard enough to remove what you need it to. Its exactly what I was looking for.
3,A bit harsh,Effective cleaning but a bit harsh for hands. I am using it in the kitchen to clean veggies. Nice size and shape for that.
4,Nail Brush,"Hi all, this product works as expected. I have in the bathroom ready to use at any time and I just love it. Seems to be made well I would definitively recommend it."
3,pretty great brush,"This one is working fine and will last and last, loved by those I gave it to. My farm workers!"
3,Good brush,"This is a pretty good nail brush. The bristles are a bit on the soft side, for my taste, but all-in-all it's an OK nail-scrubber. The bristles on the side intended for ""nail cleaning"" are a bit hard to use, but the brush is a lot better than the ones with wood handles (which sog out and decompose in short order). The price is really good."
1,WalmartSoft Brush no Heavy Duty,I purchase alot on amazon and ebay. So I know a good deal when i see it. On this product save your shipping if you are looking for a true strong bristle brush this one is not for you. I would say it is equivalent to a hard hair brush more than a heavy duty nail brush so save your 2 or 3 dollars + shipping and tax! You may Thank me later.
5,Stick with Traser - 20 years and still going strong!,"I've had this model for about 20 years. It still keeps perfect time. The glow of the dots has faded but still easy to read at night or in a movie theater. I still get compliments on this watch. The crystal face over the years has a little wear but still perfectly clear. I just can't believe how well this watch has held up over the years. It's the only watch I wear.Someone above mentioned this watch is the same as Luminox. They are mistaken. That use to be the case but is not longer so. I was researching this watch as I am thinking of getting a silver one. I discovered Luminox sold half their company to Mondaine which now makes the watches in China. And, as expected quality has dropped. You'll see people writing bad reviews for these watches. Also, there are a lot of ""Authentic"" replica Luminox watches coming from China - beware.All the traser H3 watches are manufactured in Switzerland with Swiss movements and are using the mb-microtec lights."
4,A Good Textbook,"I have been studying Chinese for almost eight years since my sophomore year in high school. As a college senior, I feel that this is one of the better textbooks out there. The articles are not too hard to read once the vocabulary has been studied and learned. It will help any serious student of Chinese learn the vocabulary and grammar utilized in the business world."
5,Great service and info,The information was very detailed and informative. The product was exactly what I expected and ordered. The service was very quick and hassel free.Well done
2,my mistake,Great product but it is not formatted for viewing in my region. My error or theirs? I can play it on my laptop but only 3 times before I permanently change my regional settings on my laptop. Not happy with this situation at all.
3,Applegator43,"A 3 Disc movie, Interesting with lots of twists. Good but no comparison to the thorn birds."
1,review for mistrals daughter,the story was great as well as the actors. I did not like to see the english sub titles on the page. When I tried to remove the english sub titles they would not go away and so it ruined the viewing quality.
3,Nice,The story is GREAT. The STUPID thing is that at the end of each chapter they show you what is going to happen in the next chapter. If that is not bad enough. when the next chapter starts they show you what happened in the previous chapter. The total time is 400 minutes. Without all the crap it may be only ~ 200 minutes.Be prepared to use the fast forward button a LOT.
5,Great Tv Series,"It's great, Thx. Just take note it does not have subtitles in spanish nor other language."
1,disappointing,"Not a great novel at all, and not satisfying to someone looking for fiction concerning poker in particular."
1,LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE,"If you are expecting to buy this camera.........BE VERY CAREFUL.....when a chip burned out on my S7000, after only 3 yrs, Fuji wanted $170.00 ro replace it and would only stand behind it for 3 months!!!! My question is why did it burn out in the 1st place??? The camera was never abused or dropped and I only take 3-400 pics a yr............"
2,cute BUT.......,THIS stoller is cute but is very flimsy...its very hard to turn and the recline feature sucks..it doesnt hold a child that is over 18 months very well at all. i did like how easy it could be folded up though!
4,Close to perfect,My wife and I bought this stroller after much research and searching. I like it but it is not perfect. It is a little short for tall people like my father in law and the straps to hold our son in were too short. Our son is on the bigger size 30 # and 32 inches. The storage underneath is hard to access. Otherwise we were pretty happy with its overall weight and smooth ride. Good luck with finding your stroller; you will probably buy more than one.
3,It's just OK,"This stroller does not have a height adjustment. I am 5'7 and have to bend a little to push it. I also find that I kick the wheels a lot when I am walking. The wheel base is very close together and I have big feet. If you are average or above average height, you might want to consider a diffrent stroller."
1,A Poor Pamphlet,"This very thin tome demonstrates that the author has no understanding of research or scholarship. It is nothing more than a plagiarised version of the very few sources quoted in the lamentable section entitled ""REFERENCES"". Anyone seriously interested in sausages would be well advised to give this booklet a wide berth and perhaps purchase the somewhat antiquated but nonetheless scholarly work of Antony and Araminta Hippisley-Coxe entitled ""The Great Book of Sausages""."
3,2 1/2 Stars -- Just A So-So Read!,"I read Hell's Kitchen mainly because Jeffery Deaver wrote it -- and I'm a bit sorry that I did. The plot's concept is fairly interesting, which involves a Hollywood location scout in NYC to film a documentary about the residents of Hell's Kitchen and coming to the aid of an elderly woman accused of having her tenement set on fire. However, Deaver's execution of the plot is somewhat disjointed and implausible, and it moves at too slow a pace. And, while the ending has a fair amount of excitement, it's too litle, too late. Further, I found the characters in Hell's Kitchen to be rather thinly developed, in that they were one-dimensional, somewhat stick-like figures. Although Hell's Kitchen, which was written earlier in Deaver's career under the pseudonym, William Jefferies, is not a BAD book,it is a book I'd advise you to skip. It is easy to understand why it was not published until after Deaver became a ""household name."""
3,Hell's Kitchen,"Good book but Deaver has written better. Lost interest in book, had to sit it down and come back to it later. Still a decent read."
1,Long on talk short on excitment,This was a very boring book. The story would have been better if there were less characters
3,Not ready for Kindle,"The novel itself was fine. Compared to the earlier John Pellam stories, this was more like the Jeffery Deaver books that got me hooked in the first place.What was truly disappointing was the Kindle version. It appears that somebody just took a printed copy of the novel, scanned it with OCR (optical character recognition) and hoped for the best. There are the obvious misinterpretations of scanned text (""die"" when it should be ""the"") along with poor spacing all around. Section breaks are left out, so you're all of a sudden in a different time or place without a break in the flow to clue you in. Even new paragraphs are indented just the tiniest sliver, so it's often hard to follow a simple conversation without the visual cues. A quick read by a 10-year-old with a high-lighter could have corrected most of the flaws, but clearly the publisher was just looking to fill up digital pages at seven bucks a pop.P. S. ""Bloody River Blues"" is just as poorly formatted."
3,Not Like the Rest,"First let me say that I am a huge Jeffrey Deaver fan. He is definitely one of the top three in my eyes but this book left a lot to be desired. It was a struggle to get through it and it was way too predictable compared to his other novels that have trademark twists and turns. I did appreciate the historical nature of the novel and learning more about Hell's Kitchen. However, I was overall disappointed with the novel's content."
4,Burning Flames,"The long awaited final story in the John Pellam series take the reader deep into the back streets of New York with an pyromaniac. HELL'S KITCHEN by Jeffery Deaver is an action packed fast read.John Pellam meets Ettie Washington and asks for an interview of his non-existent budget documentary on HELL'S KITCHEN.

3,Does not come with the Autostar,"I too just got this scope and it only comes with a hand controler and motor that allows for tracking objects. The picture on Amazon shows an autostart controller, and when I ordered mine there was only the one review that made it seem like it did come with it. It's been cloudy here at night since I got it so I havn't had the chance to look at much, the little I've seen looked good though. I still haven't deceided if I'm going to send it back, at less then $150 it still seem like a good deal even without the Autostar."
2,This telescope dosent have Autostar!!,I Just recived this telescope and was expecting it to have a autostar controller as shown in the picture- all it comes with is auto tracking - no autostar! I am sending it back. the telescope itself looks pretty good but if you want autostar goto get a different scope.
3,no information is in this ad!!!!!!!,"Ad is very poorly written, no specifications, no eyepiece listings or anything, How can anyone know what they are getting with such a poorly written ad."
4,A nice review and high quality publication.,"I have been searching for information about Horst for quite some time and eventually ran across this book on the Internet. It gives a broad overview of his work, but, as I'm mainly interested in fashion, nudes, and photographing women in general; I feel there are too many other areas of his work represented that do not address these interests. This book has spurred my continuing interest and I'd like to see more of his fashion and nude photographs and would most certainly be interested in a definitive biography of this fascinating photographer."
4,the man has style,"well i got to this book as a aprt of an erotic photography search and though the front cover does look very erotic, at least to me, the rest of the book isn't that alureing, it is however a great though a bit too short collection of a great inovating photographer which is just so plesent and interesting to look at, i got it a few weeks ago and i simply can't stop looking at it, the power and delicute of those photos, everything's done to it's extream styling which just send you stright away into a total fantasy world.so, it's not what i was looking for, but i'm very very pleased with it."
2,Slapdash,"This is the first Tea Shop Mystery I've read, and it will probably be the last. Between the sloppy editing, the barely two dimensional characters, and the tortured storyline I was completely underwhelmed."
2,"Strong on atmosphere, No plot to speak of","In this fourth outing for Theodosia and her cohorts at the Indigo Tea shop, the atmosphere is everything. Forget about a coherent plot! The book just ends, the killer is unmasked by accident, and Theodosia as usual flounders from suspect to suspect without ever coming to any conclusion. Delaine Dish's sister is an annoying subplot, even if she does wind up doing the wrong thing at the right time to point Theodosia to the real culprit. Perry Mason, where are you? Paging Ellery Queen!"
5,Great Series...,"I have thoroughly enjoyed all four of the Laura Childs' tea mystery books. The English Breakfast Murder defines the characters to an even greater level.The plot is intense as always and the subplots ever present. As always, I really enjoyed the recipes.I have especially loved reading about Charleston and the various bits of information about teas."
2,Intentional comedy or typographical errors?,"At first the frequent misspellings or typographical errors are annoying and slightly distracting, but by the time one reads about the ""grizzly"" (instead of grisly) murder, the hapless reader finds that any properly somber reflections about death are replaced by unfortunately hilarious thoughts and ghastly puns (e.g., perhaps the victim couldn't bear to be in the story for even one more paragraph)."
2,A letdown,"This was a very disappointing entry in an excellent series. I had to force my way to finish it since the plot was so uninteresting. I didn't care about finding the murderer because there was no sympathy developed for the victim. The major characters in the series, normally fun, were annoying. Drayton moped throughout the book, Haley whined and complained, and Theodosia was too busy running around going to fashion events and hosting teas that solving the murder took a back seat. Even she was apathetic! As for Theo and her boyfriend, this is not exactly the romance of the century. They are more like brother and sister. I doubt that most women would consider being called ""kiddo"" by their boyfriends a term of endearment. By the time the murder was solved, it was anticlimactic, and I was just glad that the book came to an end. This book did not have the cozy charm that the others in the series did. Those who like this series can skip this entry and hope that the next book gets back on track."
2,A letdown,"I looked forward to this book with high hopes, since the other books in the series are excellent. It was very hard to get into the book and want to continue to the end because the story just wasn't interesting. The reader doesn't get a sense of who the victim was, so it's hard to feel sympathy for the person. The murder part of the story really took a backseat to all the distracting social functions that Theodosia, the heroine, had to attend. The supporting characters, normally fun and three dimensional, were boring, whining, and morose throughout the book. Theo's relationship with her boyfriend, Jory, still doesn't progress. They are more like brother and sister. The magic of the earlier books simply isn't here."
4,Surprisingly good,"I listen mosltly to metalcore stuff llke Norma Jean, Poison the Well, and Strongarm, most of the time not emo at all. Even though this album is pretty emo sounding, it has a lot of the aggresiveness and chaos that i like. I especially like how their songs are so easy to dance to. You just can't help it. Track 10, ""I Am Hollywood"", is my favorite and probably the heaviest song on the album. Check it out."
5,more than just 10 songs,"i normally stray away from emo-type stuff, but this album completely threw me for a loop. effectively cramming three decades worth of rock and roll into an album with a tight theme, He Is Legend have started something great with I Am Hollywood. I've heard a few of their other tunes off the 91025 EP and, well, it's on it's way to me as I type. i can only hope it's as good as this one. awesome pop culture references too. it's not often that you get a new album that gets better with every listen, but here we are."
5,sweet victory! This is one solid CD,"For anyone who hasnt heard this cd a couple times, definitely check it out. They have some great change-ups with some bad ass hooks; real melodic on the vocals. And the guitar work is straight rockin'. I would call this high energy, passionate music. They have a good mix of soft slow parts. The harder parts have heavy screaming, but dont let that throw you off.. ""I Am Hollywood not only supplies listeners with clever lyrics mixed with cathartic vocals and catchy beats, but every song is so convincing of their heartfelt sincerity that when Croom shouts shake that thing! in the midst of their title track, listeners will find themselves doing just that."""
3,ok cd,"ok, so the album is not as good as I expected, the opening and closing tracks are killer, and I mean really really good stuff, the problem is that somewhere in between it strides towards alternative/nu-metal territory and starts to become a bit of a tedious listen.but come on, to whoever said that the first track was a sunny day-esque mess is lost, and i mean completely lostgive this cd a spin"
2,"splenda only in the music world ""made from rock so it sounds like rock""","this cd is the reason i dont buy christian cds. its not got originality to it save one or two tracks, there is nothing i hate more than hearing something that has that ""im so bad cuz i scream"" sound to it and this cd really delivers. if you want to think your a rocker get this cd if you want to listen to real rock go elsewhere"
5,So good it brought me to tears...,"I have been waiting for this cd for a long time....a really long time. Finally on 2/24/04, the wait was over. Let me say that it was TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT!!! Although it only has 9 tracks, it is just as long as many other major releases.Orgy lost the make-up but haven't lost the style and flair that made them famous. I HIGHLY suggest getting this cd, you will not be dissappointed."
1,Two letters: N-O!,"I used to love Orgy, it was definitely one of my favorite bands. All of that changed now, and for a good reason. There is no way I would concider purchasing this album. For one, they kept us waiting YEARS for some new material, and when they finally come out with something, they make it a 9 effortless track CD. The songs aren't that good, and Jay's voice wasn't meant for screaming. Even the cover art of Punk Static Paranoia looks cheap (and, aren't those the fonts that Korn used in their ""Issues"" album?)... and quite frankly, I'm tired of looking at guys wear make-up. Too bad though, they used to have great talent.Don't buy it, we have enough wannabe metal bands out there, this is just another one of those."
5,Orgy's back and better than ever!,"What can I say?This cd just rocks! I have been a fan of Orgys for a long time now and I was so happy that they had finally come out with a new album. I bought this cd the day it came out and with just one listen I fell in love with it. If you don't like this cd then you can go to hell and listen to your sissy backstreet boys. My favorite tracks are:ashamed,the obvious,inside my head,leave me out,& beutiful disgrace."
2,Now this is shocking,"How could such mature musicians such as the members of Orgy who suprised us all with their precedent originality be able to sink miserably into the popular wave of nu-metal ? Sure, they hung around with korn and linkin park, but the guitarist Amir firmly stated that they had nothing to do with their music. I'm sorry, but he is officialy a liar. What is in this album ? well, rap parts, poor nu metal riffs, melodies that have already been used in their other albums, a terrible artwork dedicated to 15 year old loosers, lyrics that shouldn't be written they are so shameful and an admired jay who has lost hiw charismatic voice. I advise all readers to certainly avoid this cd which is far from coming from the heart and soul of orgy, but to try their other truly original works, the ones worth hearing, not some Linkin Park/korn reproduction (and badly too)."
2,"A hard, right turn in the wrong direction.","With the release of their second album (the phenominal, spacey, glam-influenced Vapor Transmission) it seemed like Orgy had improved and matured since Candyass, their generally awkward debut. With Punk Statik Paranoia, however, it seems the band has suddenly shifted towards developing a more mainstream, dare I say ""nu-metal"" sound. The album is strewn with generic metal riffs and radio-friendly melodies, and lead singer Jay Gordon even tries rapping and the occasional scream on tracks like Leave Me Out. In the end, though, the band sounds more like a stale Linkin Park clone than the Orgy that crafted compelling songs like Opticon and Eyes-Radio-Lies. Even the lyrics seem a little too straight-forward and watered-down. Often a long absence from the studio (four years in this case) finds a band reinvigorated and putting out a great record, but unfortunately with Punk Statik Paranoia, Orgy seems to have gone down the road of pop-culture parody."
2,Unexpected release,"PSP is sort of disappointing. It's nothing like their early stuff. there are 9 tracks altogether. the instrument sounds are dope but the songs are terrible. on ""vague"" you hear the better side of orgy. this song is not that great but is a much more realistic song for this album. on the letdown ""leave me out"" there's this intro that sounds like a beat from some whiny boy band which was unbelievable. what were they thinking?""inside my head"" might pass for a good song you hear on the speakers while shopping at express. this one isn't too bad.the rest is dumb, especially when jay raps in part of the first song."
2,This always happens,"Every band moves on from its original sound and that is expected if the band was creative in the first place. But Orgy moved some where far, far away from their old sound that the older fans enjoyed. Just by looking at the CD cover I knew something was wrong and your not saposed to judge a book by its cover but dear god this [STINKS] Move on if you liked them before. But your pre-teen baby bat, punk, or emo wanabe siblings will love it. Buy it for their birthday. Honest. Your parents might love it to."
3,on the fence... (border line good),"This album takes some getting used to. It's nowhere near as good as Vapor Transmission and sure as hell isn't anywhere close to Candyass. But it's not as bad as some might have you think. It's a slump and a change in direction (let's hope not for long) but this cd is ultimately somewhere between three and four stars. If you enjoyed Orgy's previous albums you might enjoy this one as well, my bet is that you'll feel exactly the same as I do."
3,I usually like long-awaited CDs.,"This isn't one that I like. Each song is... all right, I suppose. But it seems like none of the songs have a chorus or a catch or anything... It's like the whole CD is one long verse. If the album was cheaper, I'd say MAYBE go pick it up. But it's really not all that great.Another thing, I actually DO think it has a lot of the older Orgy style... I don't think they've changed too much. They have lost a lot of their industrial sense, but it's still Orgy. Despite this, I still only rate the CD 3 out of 5 stars. Sorry, guys."
2,Uninspired,"Well. I had hopes for this album. I wasnt entirely let down, however only a few songs on this album even approach what Orgy have accomplished in the past. I would like to write a drawn out review analysing each song, but I dont feel that its worthy of the effort.I feel that a band may evolve, but that true evolution is an outgrowth of prior efforts, and that naturally outbranching will occur. Screaming and forsaking of past electronica influences almost entirely are NOT a natural progression from their prior efforts, but simply an effort to tailor to a larger audience. Lyrics are more straightforward, and some will argue that this makes them not worse, just more accessible. And yet it was Jays jaded, sometimes metaphorical offerings that made his lyrics stand out and endowed them with a certain odd joy when listening.Candyass remains their masterpiece, with Vapor Transmission close behind."
2,Lame,"What happened to Orgy sounding original? I really like their style, and am a fan of Candyass, and to a lesser extent, Vapor Transmission. But this stuff is so far from compelling it's ridiculous. A lot like Korn's new album, Take a Look in the Mirror; it sounds like they've run out of steam and are reaching for the sound they think ""nu-metal"" fans want to hear. Look, if you don't have any new ideas or the courage to travel in new musical directions, just break up. Stop embarassing yourselves, and more importantly, fans like me.No style. No substance."
1,"A ""Digital"" Disaster","Orgy has had two good albums before this disaster was created. I personally was waiting for a new Orgy album since 2001. It took them this long to create something so horrible. From the first track up to the ninth track it's really really bad. Orgy went from the so called ""Death Wave Pop"" sound to a horrid nu-metal sound. Honestly, the only thing I liked about this album is 1 sentence in a song. That's it. Not even a full song. So unless you're fond of Nu-Metal, don't look into this album. Get the first two albums. They are better. Don't buy this and expect this to be all synthy, a little vague and science fiction'y."
2,I suppose it was inevitable,"*sigh* It seems to be a trend with good bands lately. What with Powerman 5000 abandoning their sci-fi theme, and now Orgy abandoning just about everything that made them what they were, it will be a suprise if we have any good original artists left anymore by 2010. Not that this album is pure trash, because it really isn't. It just further proves one thing: don't mess with a good thing. I won't be suprised if this album is the end of Orgy's career, which will be quite saddening indeed."
1,lame.,"this album still upsets me and is about as far as anything orgy should have came up with for a third album. my advice? stick to candyass / vapor transmission. i always admired jay gordon and his gang... but gordon seemed to take over the psp with his anger and immaturity. but not all is lost, if you are interested in something close to this genre and their musical members... be sure to look out for ""julien-k""... they're the latest and greatest thing. i'm sure jay gordon will continue to bless us with amazing vocals sometime in the future as well, so hopefully that'll keep us on our toes...oh and if i had to give this album any stars at all, it's because amir, ryan, bobby, and paige are such fantastic musicians.... they deserve all the glory."
3,Not their BEST record but SOME good tracks,"Its kind of ironic that this record was released 2 days before my 21st birthday. Anyway, on with the REVIEW if you will. Candyass, being their best cd, VT, their 2nd best. But PSP? I dunno what to say about this one..... I had lots of faith in Orgy from the time I first heard them back in the late 90's. It was back in the days when Mtv wasnt being taken over by teenybopper crap like it is today.Favorite tracks:Beautiful DisgraceVagueThe ObviousInside my headCant take thisOverall theres at least 5 good tracks on here (the ones i just listed) so the record is somewhat medeocre. One thing that disappoints me about the record overall is that it seems like Jay tried to hard with this one. Im not really good at writing these reviews, so............."
3,Doesn't feel like an Orgy.,"I just loved Orgy. They have succeeded in something that many others failed in - In creating some kind of metal that can't be easily categorized in an existing category. In creating a category of their own.They were'nt Gothic, neither they were Heavy Metal, not even Nu-Metal - They were Orgy.Their first two albums were wonderful. Spotted with pearls like Eva or Platinum, not mentioning Fiction and Stitches, they have managed to create something new.This album is plainly a step back - It's kitsch. It is a metal cliche. Nothing wrong about it actually, but it brings nothing new. In this album, every thing sounds like something else - Bits of Static X, some Limp Bizkit sound. You know what I mean. The only song that at least sounds like an original-orgy-product is Leave Me Out - But one good song that you just 'skip forward' to from the beginning of the album, is just not enough.This album is good if you want to listen to something else, not to Orgy."
4,Appropriate sequel to Vapor Transmission,"After roughly a 4 year wait, synth-metal rockers Orgy return with Punk Statik Paranoia. Fans of 2000's Vapor Transmission won't be too disappointed. Some of the noteworthy tracks are ""Ashamed"", ""Leave Me Out"", and ""The Obvious"". There's not a lot of songs, but at least half the tracks are catchy, even if nothing is as memorable as ""opticon"" or ""blue monday"". Fortunately Orgy seems to prefer quality over quantity when it comes to songs.While the sound seems to maintain the same as it did on Vapor the difference is in the writing. Much of it a mixture of phobic and anti-social. Punk Statik Paranoia is the most personal and also the coldest of Orgy's albums. (I do credit Orgy though, for not compromising how they really feel for the pop norm. This is something Filter did with 2002's The Amalgumut.) This usually makes for a risky effort but since the personal touch has a pop style to it, this is to Orgy's credit."
2,Why Bother?!?,"Some bands are able to make a kick ass debut album that leads to more good albums. Orgy is not one of those bands. The originality, melody, uniqueness is all but gone. This album(if you could call it that) is not good for several reasons. For one, It only has 9 songs and clocks in at a lil' over half an hour(the last one was way longer). You think they could write more than that in 4 years. The songs are mediocre and bland. They dont have that awesome synth melody behind the guitars anymore(so what's Amir doing on this record?). Its all typical, worn out nu-metal riffs. The lyrics arent interesting either, they are dumb and very repetative. Jay does try to scream on this one, which is ok I guess. He even gets a lil' rappy at times, which is not ok by Orgy standards. I gave this album 2 stars b/c it does surprisingly have its good moments. This is not a nice review I know, but the evidence is on the record. This album is going to be the permanent end of Orgy's career for sure."
2,Tears to my Eyes,"What happened? Can someone please tell me what's going on? No wonder Ryan and Amir have Julien-K.And yes, if you know Julien-K, you know what that means. Where did all the dazzling synth-guitar parts go? Where did all the v-drums go? There is barely any of their electronic roots at all on this album. They definately have turned their backs on everything they were about.This album is nu-metal. The lyrics are so insanely horrible. Look at the lyrics Orgy used to write for their songs. They were all so akward and clever and just down-right awesome. These are sobby heartache songs. I don't understand how you do that.What happened to Orgy? The only good songs are Vague and The Obvious. That's about it. And please don't scream Jay. Please."
2,Uh oh.,"Although I haven't been an Orgy fan for too long (2 years), I still think I'm entitled to say that Punk Statik Paranoia was less than good.I read someone else's review and they referred to the newer sound being somewhat similar to that of Nine Inch Nials, which I think is way off. Orgy definitley sounded like NIN on Candyass and still a bit on Vapor transmission, and to be honest, I really love Trent Reznor's music. But on PSP they edged away from that, their dark apocolyptic cyber goth sound gone for good.As for the album, I heard ""Beautiful Disgrace"" and thought I had put a Linkin Park song onto one of my mix CD's by accident, literally. I understand that Jay helped out with Reanimation, but Linkin Park's sound should stay theirs and Orgy should really dust off the synthesizers and bring back the industrial."
3,they've rebounded a little,"ok..Candyass was ok, it had a few good ones on it and then Vapor Transmission just went right downhill. But this is good, considering it has 9 songs. Theres good music on here, its not all ""techno-ish"" and industrial. Its kool"
1,One big anticlimactic downer of an album...,"Having been a HUGE fan of the first 2 Orgy albums, I, like many other Orgy fans flocked to the store to grab the new one as soon as it was out... what a disappointment. The only word I can use that accurately describes this album is anti-climactic. Every single song comes dangerously close to rocking... but I found myself unfulfilled at the end of each song. A chorus is rarely heard on this compilation... a good hook is also missing through most of it as well. Jay rambles like a 12 year old throwing temper tantrums... they nu-metal screaming thing ...... Jay had such a good voice before... perfect for the music style... now he's gotta pretend to be hardcore... ugh... stay away from this one folks... it ...."
4,Check out the soundtrack songs by Orgy!!!,"For all of you who are dissapointed with the number of songs on this album, take a look at some of their singles that are on movie soundtracks..Orgy may have taken a while to release their third cd, but they definently have not been slacking. Check out Slept so long on the Queen of the Damned Soundtrack and their other song on the Zoolander soundtrack..both awesome. And for those who think that Orgy took some of Slipknot's style, get a clue please. Slipknot's first album was released a whole year after Orgy came out with Candyass.I just felt that this should be said considering so many people are whining about the number of songs."
2,What Happen?????????,This album is the down fall of the band. I loved Candyass and Vapor Transmission. I seems as if Jay Gordon is trying to hard to mix in with the mainstream with the other punk rock wannabe bands out there. Please bring the gayness back Jay.
5,Life in the Fast Lane,"Larry McMurtry. Author of such great fiction as Lonesome Dove; Terms of Endearment; Horseman, Pass By (later made into the movie Hud) and many, many other skillful pieces of literary works, tries his pen at non-fiction. Wonderful!Whereas Charles Kuralt leisurely traveled America's back roads searching for the common American human fabric, McMurtry zips down mainly high-speed Interstates throughout the country making observations of landscapes, billboards, local writers, playwrights or poets from the area, coupled with the folks he meets along the way.From time to time he wanders down less traveled roads...the two-lanes...just out of curiosity or to break from boredom. Great stories.The chapter ""Short Roads to a Deep Place"" is a sincere rendering of one's own reflections."
4,A Nice Road AND History Book,"This book does a great job of thoroughly describing the history of the area around a road. For example, the author passes through a country highway and passes an old Indian reserve. He gives a rather detailed description of the preserve and the Natives who once lived there. Along the way, he also makes reference to battles and massacres that happened near the road's current location. The author also makes reference to authors and writers who lived in or near the places he travels through.A nice read if you are into history or authors (or the author's own life, for that matter), but if you strictly want the travel narrative, this may not be the book for you."
3,Road Warrior Companion,"As a fellow ""accidental tourist"", I found McMurtry's loose journal of his road trips (which were taken for the sole purpose of writing about them) entertaining. Part of the reason for this is my own familiarity with some of the places he traveled through. But in addition to that, his observations, sprinkled with memoirs, snippets of American history and that dusty Texas candor, made this unique travelogue amusing. I wish all my traveling companions were as engaging as Mr. McMurtry seems to be on a long trip.For readers who enjoy the McMurtry view of the world, may I suggest any of the five CDs by Larry's son, James, a singer-songwriter of underappreciated merit from Austin."
1,very strange,"Very strange ""travel"" book; McMurty's admits his prime goal in traveling is to cover mileage, he puts in ten hour driving days- covers 600 miles a day, sticks to interstates, rarely talks to anyone, soaks up no local culture, visits no museums or cultural targets, eats and sleeps on the interstate. Very boring, banal, tedious. Why would anyone write this? Why would anyone publish it?"
2,Asa,"You get to meet the real person, Larry McMurtry, who comes off as a sour and self-absorbed bore. Perhaps the title of this book should have been ""All the Places I Hate to Drive Through in America"". I expected a more pleasant ride."
4,Interesting.,"In ""Roads"", Mr. Larry McMurtry travels the Interstate Highways System of the USA. Along the way, he comments on certain places and tells of his adventures. He also links history to the places he visits or passes by. I found it interesting, then again I'm what they call a ""Road Geek"" ;) . You don't have to enjoy roads and highways to enjoy Mr. McMurtry's book, however."
4,Interesting insights and observations,"Briefly, I thought the book provided the reader an interesting and fresh perspective on American locales and culture. I found it a valuable alternative to Blue Highways styled narratives - not deriding them - just commenting on the welcome change. Additionally, I found some of his literary references helpful."
1,One of the Most Pointless Books Ever Written,"The title says it all. Driving the highways. If you have ever driven the ""great"" highways, you'll be well aware of the monotony. If you did not get enough of it out on the road, the book will provide you the opportunity to experience even more monotony from the convenience of your armchair."
1,"Oh, please","The book has an interesting premise, ie the author's thoughts while roaring along selected interstate highways. And, it has its moments, but not nearly enough to justify your spending time reading it. McMurtry should be ashamed at writing what is so clearly a shallow book to make a few dollars based on his name. Reader beware. You will be disappointed."
4,This is the diary of a lonely man.,"Mr. McMurtry is a very introspective man, and American roads are intimately connected to his soul. In these roads he sees his past, which he contrasts with the present, sometimes drawing fabulous analogies. Our roads are the rivers of the past. But my overall impression of this formidable book, is that Mr. McMurtry is sad, and even though that might not have been his motivation in writing this book, his sadness comes across very strongly. It is a good book, despite several editorial errors that should have been caught by his legendary editor."
4,"Roads, roads, and more roads.","Larry McMurtry's book Roads is perfectly titled. His book is a nine month adventure of the wonderful highways and byways of the United States. He takes us through almost the entire U.S. of A. All the while throwing in little interesting tid bits here and there. Each place he visits he knows of at least one famous author from the town. He has a vast knowledge of towns, perhaps because he has visited each one multiple times. However he does, his travels take you on a peaceful journey, for the most part, from town to town. He also takes the time to mention many of the museums you could visit if you followed the paths of Larry McMurtry, many of which sound intersting enough to pay a visit. The book has an overall good and peaceful feel to it. A man on his journey through the U.S. with nothing but his rental car, a TIME magazine, and the open road all equal to a good read."
1,Why did Larry Bother?,"I am a very big fan of a) Larry McMurtry, and b) Travel Books of all kinds. I hated this book. Anyone who travels 1500 miles in a day and a half is not observing the road nor its surroundings, and is therefore not able to write about it. I got so sick of 'I passed near Anytown Texas where Danny Deck did such and such in my book Blah Blah', 'I was droving through Mississippi when I thought of an amusing story about Eudora Welty and William Faulkner'. Do not waste your time or money on this...publication."
1,"Why leave home, Larry?","I don't understand why McMurtry felt it was necessary to leave his Archer City Bookstore to wander the highways of America. He doesnt' stop to see anything of any interest, doesn't talk to anybody, eats at predictable tollway fast food stops, sleeps at tollway motels and makes most of his observations at a speed in excess of 80 miles an hour. Most of the time he is simply using the places he whizzes past as a launching point for his insufferable ruminations. Couldn't he have done this from the comfort of his own home? If he wasn't a famous author he never would have got this tepid travelogue past the receptionists desk at the publisher's office. To me, McMurtry makes life on the road a grim and mundane prospect."
4,"I love OS X, but be wary of the server version","my advice is to make sure you need it before you buy it, but if you know you need it, then buy it. How will you know? If you need it, you would already know that you do. If you don't know that you need server version, then you probably don't need it. Most day to day tasks are done by the normal version of the os in ways that are much simpler than the server tools. Now you do get a variety of nice things with the unlimited client, such as server managment systems, monitoring systems, etc., but if you are just doing a basic install without a complex networking or users/groups system, then you probably should try to do what you need to do with a 10.1 or 10.2 and see if you actually have to own the server. I would say the ideal application of a server install is for a medium to large lab install using netboot, where the actual cost of doing it via server will lower the TCO significantly."
4,"Ratical, Indeed!","I purchased this album from Rasputina's website as soon as it was released there, and it stayed in my cd player (or technically, it stayed on repeat on my iPod) for a full fortnight after. It's full of the rock, groove, beauty, and madness that typefies the live Raspy experience.I HIGHLY recommend this cd to any fans who love to see the band live in recital, or who have not yet had the pleasure. If you don't have this recording, buy it now! Wait a minute... why don't you have it yet?The only reason I've given a rating of 4, rather than 5, is that I feel the sound quality could be a tad better in some spots; it can get a little murky. But for the most part, it sounds pretty good.I'll also mention, for anyone who doesn't know, that Zoe's latest solo cd is now available on her website, zoekeating.com. She's a wonderful artist in her own right - check it out!"
3,Nice Air Rifle,"Accuracy has been very good. Single pump is the way to go. I have killed a squirrel and some other small varmints. I had a problem with the screws coming loose and falling out in the front part of the stock. When I tried to tighten them enough, they stripped. Threadlock helped but eventually had to re-tap the holes and use larger screw with threadlock. Lot of trouble actually. Company was very willing to send me new screws. anybody else with this problem?"
4,It's Fine,It looks nice on the kitchen table. Smaller than I thought it would be. The crank handle is the best feature. Makes it easy to grip even when your hands are wet while cooking. Maybe a little over priced.
1,Bad news. Too bad. When I saw broken plastic pieces in the pepper that made me feel sad.,First one arrived with the handle broken off. Amazon replaced it. Second one seemed OK but did not seem to work well. Then I noticed broken plastic mixed in with the pepper corns. I try to avoid eating plastic even if it is ground up good. I am returning this second one and paying a few more dollars to get a better product.
2,Not impressed,"I bought this rather than a less expensive one because of its apparently more durable construction. Bad decision. Not that it isn't durable. It does seem to be. But in addition to durability I want good output of the specified grind. The course grind isn't all that course, and the mill simply doesn't produce much pepper per rotation of the handle. So I am not satisifed with this mill and probably will replace it soon."
4,Healing,This book is the topic of bible study and just reading the the first chapter you know that it is going to be a healing in process.
2,"Well, it *does* make sound","The radio is pretty much what you'd expect for ~$30. Sound comes out of it (to two speakers only though) that reminds one of the sound quality of AM radio (ie: not good). Bass/treble controls don't do much. It's ability to tune FM stations isn't so great either. The MP3 input works, but you can't switch between radio and MP3...once you plug something in, that's the only input you can use. You can only view the clock with the radio off, and when off, the face doesn't illuminate. Didn't test the cassette part.If you simply want the cheapest way to connect an MP3 player to a car, this will do it. If you care at all about sound quality, spend a few extra bucks and get something better."
1,Stay away from it,"The folks in China (it says 'Made in China') must have skipped one or more finishing processes. The surface feels rough and splintery - it 's obvious that the board was not sanded down to a smooth finish, nor seasoned or oiled.. Evidence of very poor quality control indeed. Also, the paper label that Typhoon stuck around the board leaves a gummy residue so recalcitrant that it required paint thiner to get the gook off. At least it's being discontinued - be it for above or other reasons."
2,Badly made,"I liked these at first; they're good sizes, and not bad looking. Two of the lids tore within a week or two, though (I've never had a lid do that on one of my Pyrex containers), and the enamel isn't sturdy at all, and chips off easily (one fell a foot or two onto a very soft cork floor, and chipped both inside & out, ruining the batter inside as well as the bowl). So now it's only 5 months later (past the return window), and only two of them are fully functional; I had to toss one because of the inside chips, another one is chipped on the outside, and two have split lids. I'd stick with the Pyrex sets...."
5,Great look in more ways than one,"Boy, does this monitor look good. In comparison to all the other LCDs I've seen, this one ranks at the top. There was no problem with set up or any aspect of operation, all the pixels work (no need for tech support), and the pre-set color temps are probably going to be adequate for all of my needs, so it seems great! The slim bezel, I feel, is a superior look too. I installed it on a win98 machine then upgraded to XP and the cleartype works best. In short, it works as advertised, a quality product."
4,It's a (Good) Monitor !,"I own this monitor and the Widescreen 19' that VS also makes, and they are both very good, reliable monitors.I don't see much difference between the Viewsonic monitors, as they are all of generally very good quality. Compared to the sceptre and HP monitors, I think the V.S. is better. However, it appears the prices have actually gone up on these, so you may do well with another brand."
2,Worked - Didn't work,"I got this to work once, for about an hour. Then it stopped. I am a pro when it comes to computer repair. It worked once when I first installed it, but after that I ran into nothing but problems. After two weeks of fiddling (installing/reinstalling OS, installing, updating, searching) I finally came to the conclusion of: When it works, it works great. When it doesnt, it will never work again. I ended up returning this product and am in search of another. Definately not for the typical home user.Oh, and there is virtually no tech support for this product."
4,Over-juggling,"The only reason the book doesn't get five stars is for the rather straight forward - get to the point writing style. Nevertheless the concepts in the book are phenomenal! This book should be required reading for everyone ages twelve and up.The book has a strong business management focus. However, it can be easily applied to about any aspect of life. As a missionary with no business background thinking skills are essential. The book was a true blessing.As de Bono states, ""We try to do too much at once. Emotions, information, logic, hope and creativity all crowd in on us. It is like juggling with too many balls.""If you desire to be a better thinker this book is a must!""Usually, the only people who are very satisfied with their thinking skill are those poor thinkers who believe that the purpose of thinking is to prove yourself right - to your own satisfaction."""
3,Interesting,"It's kind of interesting to categorize creative thinking in this fashion. However, upon reflection, it's sort'of simplistic. I'm sure it has a value for people who love to define the undefinalbe. As for me, there are a lot more definitive books out there."
2,Simplistic but has worth.,"This, in my opinion, is a very simplistic treatment of creative thinking. However, I can see its value for people who are looking for a formalistic treatment. Something that gives them a little bit of stucture to a structureless art."
1,"pretty cover, useless book","This book is useless, don't waste your time and money. Instead read DeBono's Lateral Thinking book."
3,Elementary,"Disappointed in this work of de Bono. It's very elementary and superficial. His book ""Lateral Thinking"" is a classic. This book is embarassing."
4,"""Six Thinking Hats"" compared to Futurlogics","Futurlogics was published 1983 and ""Six Thinking Hats"" was published 1985. The US author has six modes of thinking and used the color coding concept using the prizm, rainbow, and the kaleidoscope. Although Doctor de Bono alludes to the future he does not see the import it has to the thinking process. The six hats are compared in FUTURLOGICS as follows: White Hat is similar to the Natural Future or mode, Red Hat is similar to the Artificial Future or mode, Black Hat is similar to the Absolute Future or mode, Yellow Hat is similar to the Imaginary Future or mode, The Green Hat is similar to the Synthetic Future or the Creative Mode, The Blue Hat is similar to the Paridigm Future or model mode. Six Hats is great start into the thinking methods but does not reach out like Futurlogics."
2,Disappointing,This book was very disappointing for me. I've heard of Dr. De Bono and expected much more than what he offers in this book. It's bascially an elementary book about common sense divided into different segments (hats). I would not recommend this book.
1,Very interesting,"This book is very interesting in a sense that it teaches you how to take a simple concept, turn it into a 200 page book and sell for 15 bucks. Keep your dollars because all you need to know is these lines...1. Thinking is a skill that can be developed - good perspective2. instead of thinking everything at once, you plan to go step by stepconcentrate on tasks - white hatthink of everything can go wrong - black hatthink of feelings - red hatthink positive - yellow hatthink solutions - green hatand control this process - blue hat.Thanks"
2,just a simple idea expanded,"i found it slightly naiive, i mean it can help a teenager or some one with not any previous experience of reading psychology books, moreover, the whole idea of the book can be presented in one or two pages , the description of each hat is so simple that it can be easily describes in one single line. stretching that simple idea into a whole book is the only thing the writer was successful in."
4,Simple concept; easy to apply. Book was longer than necessary.,"I use Six Thinking Hats often. The approach is simple and easy to teach others, but quite effective.I would have given the book a complete 5 starts, except that it is longer than necessary. For each hat, there are approximately 5 chapters on average with the last chapter being a summary of the prior few. Frankly, the book contains superfluous detail in the guise of chapters. The summary chapters could have been fleshed slightly and stood on their own, eliminating the need for several of the chapters. That said, each chapter is only about four pages. Read it all or skip to the summaries - it's still a valuable book you can finish in a single day."
3,"A Good Read, Good Exercise for the Brain, But . . .","This review is on: Six Thinking Hats by Edward De Bono (Paperback)This book was a good read when I read it in December of 1992. Yellow Hat thinking (good points judgment - logic applied to identifying benefits, seeking harmony) needs to be applied when reading this book (see Six Thinking Hats - Wikipedia). I liked the system. It was cerebrally rewarding to read at the time. it was challenging and exciting. However, twenty years later, I've completely forgotten why I found it a good read and, over time, stopped using any of the skills discussed. I simply forgot them. Edward De Bono says a thought once thought cannot be unthought. That's not really true if it can be forgotten and thus made constructed for nought. But I can say, however, that this book thrilled my brain, gave me more than the mundane world of work and chores to think about, and I read the whole thing, I remember, in a single day."
2,Not a clear picture of the process,Reading about de Bono's Six Thinking Hats was a difficult way to learn the material. There are lots of examples but taking a class on the subject is the way to get a real idea of how to use this process.
1,Talk about fluff with no substance,"I don't know that much about the author, but this book is nothing but the usual obvious bromides. Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self by Rosalene Glickman Ph.D. is superior to this book in every aspect. I also suggest Learned Optimism by Martin Seligman, Ph.D., as a much more worthwhile read ."
2,Another Brochure turned into a book,"Simple stuff. Not that it isn't powerful stuff. It's just that it's a 12-15 page brochure at most, and DE BONO turned it into a 175 page book. Why?I can think of no audience who'd benefit from this book who wouldn't get all they need from a summary of it.If you like reading hundreds of quotes like, ""yeah yeah yeah, let get some of your best red-hat thinking on that"" and ""I heard you, but I would really like you to put some yellow-hat on that"" then this book may be for you.It's so condescending, it calls into question every one of his well-rated books."
4,Change the way you think,"It's easy to be sceptical of De Bono. His name pops up regularly whenever people talk about ideas and creative thinking. Spend a few hours in the company of this excellent book and you'll understand why. If you have ever had trouble convincing people about your ideas, get a copy of this book asap."
5,Six Thinking Hats,"This is probably the best book I've read in a long time that addresses all aspects of handling project teams or other types of meetings in a very sofisticated yet unimposing way. I even started using some of the concepts with my husband and family as well, and it really works."
1,Went up in smoke,I have had one for a couple of years. Haven't used it much. Maybe once or twice. Today I tried to use it and it started to hiss and thick white smoke started coming out of it after 30 seconds.
4,Great for kids & adults!,"I am a huge fan of How To Train Your Dragon. It's such a cute movie and I love the message that it sends. Needless to say, I was ecstatic when I found out about the DreamWorks Dragons Double Pack: Gift of the Night Fury / Book of Dragons (Two-Disc DVD Pack + Online Video Game).I watched ""Gift of the Night Fury"" first and was instantly sucked in to the story because it picks up where How To Train Your Dragon ended. Together, Hiccup and Toothless discover an island filled with new dragons. Next, I put in the ""Book of Dragons"" and learned about seven new dragons. I really enjoyed the adventure these films provided and they were a hit with my nephew. The Dragons Online Video Game was fabulous! We had a blast creating our avatars and training our dragons. My favorite part is the dragon battles."
1,Disappointment,I am very disappointed. I ordered these products for my sons birthday. He opened them today (1-27-12) and I thought they were full length movies + online game. Mins 17 and 22 is not worth what I paid. We are not happy.
1,R u kidding me?,This is like a 20 minute movie! I'm glad I rented before buying but I can assure u I won't even rent it ever again. This movie is a total joke!!! I truly LOVED how to train your dragon. It is one of mine and my kids favs and couldn't wait to watch this one. I won't waist my time next time. Stick to the first movie and save the dissatisfaction!
3,VERY SHORT!,"My daughter and I really enjoyed the Gift of the Night Fury, but it was only 22 minutes!! We expected a full length movie. And the Book of Dragons wasn't even that long. Plus the later wasn't really a story. Very disappointed. Wanted to watch another movie with Toothless, Hiccup and the rest of the Vikings."
1,way to short.,cant beleive i waited this long for a movie that did not even last for 25 minutes. loved the first movie and now this comes out and my kids begged and pleaded for it and we even wanted to watch it but then it came and it was over before we even understood what happened. allot of money for this short short short movie so i have to say the kids are crying and we will not be investing in this movie animation anymore. very disappointed here.
1,Two about 20 minute movies... not worth buying,Had i known this movie was so short i wouldn't have wasted my money. I feel reaped off after buying this movie. Wait for the Smurfs if you are looking for a kids movie.
1,Disappointed in double pack of Dragon DVDs Night Fury/ book of dragons,"I had previously loved the original ""How to train your Dragon"" Since I had seen it number of times, I have notchecked new one ordered. BUT I expected the new double pack to be movies. Instead they were around 20 minutes each& one did not even seem to have continuity. I seldom return things because it is too much trouble but shouldprobably return these."
3,Good but very short,"I preordered this for my youngest daughter (she watched the original about 80 times)so I thought she would love this also. Each movie was only a little over 20 minutes long, for the price I thought I was getting a full length movie not 2 very short films. I am glad I got it for her but wish the price reflected the quality."
2,not worth it..,"sorry, not worth your money... way to short a movie!!! was very disappointed not much else to say about it."
4,Fun & interesting,I and my twins (8 yo girls) really enjoyed this set. The information about the dragons not featured but mentioned in the original movie was fun and conjured many laughs. I would recommend this to anyone with kids over 6.
3,Short movie,"I didn't realize this was a Seasonal short movie. I wouldn't have paid the price if I had known. I thought a second movie had come out and I missed it at the theater.It was very cute, good quality, family friendly just very short and expensive for what it is."
4,"Cute, funny, short","The Christmas title is rather amusing on how the vikings deal with their holiday dilemma. There is more focus on the human characters than dragon ones and we don't see toothless much. It is rather short.And Book of dragons is a short excerpt from the dragon book Hiccup was reading in the Movie, it too is funny but short.Side note: With the 2 pack you get an access code (or at least for the next year or so you do) that give you 2 accounts with an online adventure using the How you train your dragon style characters to create a avatar and play online"
2,Very disappointed,I thought this was going to be a better movie. I thought it was a movie. This should not have been released on dvd or blu ray. It should have been the start of like a show series. I was very disappointed in it. I wanted more for what I paid for. It really was just a show. I would pay like $5 for this. And that is generous. What we saw was okay but it was not that great. I would wait for it to come out on tv.
4,Very enjoyable,"The Gift of the Night Fury is a gem and the Book of Dragons is cute, but this could have been a single package. However, the Gift of the Night Fury alone is worth the purchase. I watch it over and over again because it is a wonderful retelling of the Gift of the Magi that leaves me feeling so happy it's ridiculous."
2,not so much,just a repeat not much to look forward to she this the first movie alot but these just didnt compare.
5,dragons,"my 3 year old grandson loves these movies and i ordered the next one out. i also get a kick out of watching them, very good writing and very little violence"
4,"Enjoyable, but too short","After reading other reviews for this product I was concerned about how short the Christmas special was mentioned to be, especially for the price of the set. However, I was considering this as a birthday gift for my sister who is a great fan of the movie (as I am as well) and figured even if short it would be enjoyable.Shipping went off without a hitch. And she and I watched it a couple weeks later when we were both home over Christmas break. It was adorable. Even though we have both seen the original movie multiple times (her ~5, me ~10), it was great to see another story in the world. It was a bit predictable at times and I felt Astrid was a little out of character, but otherwise I loved it, even though it was only 20-30 minutes long. The ending even brought a tear to my eye.Cute and enjoyable addition to the HTTYD universe, but a bit expensive for what you get."
4,dreamworks dragons:gift of the night fury/book of dragons double pack,"overall it wasn't to bad. thought it was going to be more like the first dragons movie, had funny moments and it has possibilities for more but should try to make them longer"
5,Good common sense for anyone of any belief,I doubt that anyone of any belief tradition could argue with the loving kindness and compassion this book discusses. At the root of all faith traditions is the common thread of forgetting self and loving others. How to do that is what this book teaches.
5,Meditations,This is a great little book of meditations. You don't have to be a Buddhist to appreciate it. I saw someone reading this book on an airplane and was fascinated by the title. It did not disappoint.
5,Superior book covering the basics of Buddhist meditation,"Using language that everyone can understand Ayya Khema describes the basics of Buddhism and Buddhist meditation. Her writing style and the insights she presents strike the reader as unusually authentic and heartfelt. Although Ayya Khema is not well known in the United States, this book clearly places her in the forefront of other, more well-know practitioners. A Buddhist nun for many years, Ayya Khema's writing emerges from years of personal and practical experience. This book should be read by beginners as well as experienced meditators."
5,Being Nobody Going Nowhere: Meditations on the Buddhist Path,"On occasion a book appears that turns life 180 degrees and makes all the difference. It plucks the reader up and sets them on a higher plateau. Gentle and direct at the same time, Khema's words bring out not only the wisdom of Buddhism, but the wisdom of life. Her gentle prose guides the reader through the mechanics of Buddhism, yet one doesn't have to be a Buddhist devotee to garner wisdom from the book. If you read to be uplifted, this book fits. It easily fits the palm of anyone seeking knowledge, and it brings a warm breeze to the heart. Though Khema passed on a few years ago, through her book, ""Being Nobody Going Nowhere: Meditations on the Buddhist Path"" (Khema wrote over twenty-five books), she still speaks her message to the world. Try for example the chapter called ""Loving-Kindness Meditation,"" a gentle prayer amidst rough times, words that set the sails firm."
5,Enlightening & Evokative,"I had the privilege of hearing and meeting Mrs. Greenberg while in my undergraduate studies and found her lecture presentation to be the most intellectually and religiously stimulating event of those years. With this experience, I eagerly pore over virtually everything she publishes, and *On Women and Judaism* was no exception. I read and re-read the book over several months: sometimes wanting to toss it into the waste basket as it angered me so; other times wondering how I'd survived as a traditionally religious woman without it.Mrs. Greenberg weaves her own experiences into her vast knowledge of scripture and history. The result enlightens the reader and bridges the chasm between tradition and feminism without compromising either side--a nearly impossible feat.Highly recommended."
5,Bancroft talked,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out and to use an embarrassingly over used cliche, it like a fine wine has definitely only gotten better with age. If you weren't an Anne Bancroft fan before (and if not what's the matter with you?!) she will steal your heart in this one. Her character makes you want to be just like her or be lucky enough to know someone like her as well. Buy this flick. You'll leave laughing."
5,A Jewel of a Movie,"This is one of those films that never quite created the stir I expected it to when released....why I cannot fathom. It is one of those rare experiences that takes you through such a huge range of emotion. I have seen it at least 50 times and it still sweeps me off my fear. All the principles are absolutely incredible...and of course nothing could be more amazing than Anne Bancroft sinking her teeth into a role that shows her dramatic and comedic skills. I especially love how they leave out any indication of who plays Garbo in the film....leading one to fantasize about the notion that just perhaps she did one last role. And what luxuries to have smaller roles played by the likes of Dorothy Loudon and Harvey Fierstein. I remember how I used to walk the neighborhood on the east side every evening hoping I might see Garbo for myself. I'm told that Betty Comden actually did the part, but it shows how swept away you can become by a great cast and a great film."
3,Somewhat bitter sweet but greatly in need of editing.,"This film left me waiting and wanting between the seldom clever lines and finer acting moments. What a wonderful cast. Ron Silver plays a caring son to a politically eccentric mother. Yet I found myself thinking - WHO CARES!? What I don't understand is how they got all those lines in Anne Bancroft's death bed scene. Usually a person with that much dialogue is running for public office! And Carrie Fisher wasn't Gucci ENOUGH! Am I so thick or WAS the acting/directing too subtle to move this film a little faster!? My favorite parts were those played by the bit actors: the agent, the store manager, the Fire Island Fellah and the photographer. HEY!! WAS that really GARBO?"
1,Disappointed!!!,"I did not like this book! It was too slow and unrealistic. It took me three weeks to finish this book because I kept putting it down. I think the storyline could have been developed more. I was very, very disappointed!!!"
2,Good music. Terrible sound quality.,"Although this CD contains most of this Cuban bolero diva's greatest hits, its sound quality leaves much to be desired. Surprisingly, I've yet to run across a Blanca Rosa Gil CD with even halfway-decent sound quality but (meanwhile) if you're looking for the most complete anthology of her work this CD will do."
4,A clever (and fun!) gadget,"The name is somewhat misleading. What this is, actually, is a small, senitive black and white TV camera designed to slip into a telescope focuserin place of an eyepiece. Now this won't deliver images of faint, deep-sky objects- you need a cooled CCD and long exposures for that- but it will deliver excellent views of the moon and planets to a TV monitor, videorecorder of computer with video converter. Using videotape and a digitizer as a ""poor man's active optics"" it's possible to select frames and produce suprisingly good results.At the asking price, it's a pretty good deal, too, and an inexpensive way to get started in digital astrophotograp"
4,Beware...,"A few things you must know before purchasing the eyepiece:1. The display is MONOCHROME (black & white)2. You will need a 9-volt battery3. In order to hook it up to the TV, your TV needs to have a yellow-colored Video-In port. Many TVs have it, duh, but yours might not. Some of us might have pawned our good TV set just to get enough cash for an ETX-90EC.4. Keep in mind that you will need to take your TV or VCR where your telescope is. You might need an extension cord.Have fun~*"
3,Batteries may expire soon,"I just started using these batteries yesterday and don't know how long they will last, but if you plan on stocking up on these, note that they could expire very soon. The batteries I received in February 2008 expire at the end of 2008. They should be fine for short-term use, but if you're looking for batteries for an emergency kit, you might want to look elsewhere."
1,They ship so lately,"I've bought this item since two weeks ago, but they have not shipped it yet. Totally unsatisfied!"
5,Interesting and well paced,I thought the book was well paced and connected with how young people react to the world around them. It was a great adventure and I think kids will love it.
3,For a Short and Slim Person,"These knee highs would probably be just fine for a person who is short and slim, but that does not describe me. So be aware."
5,Book maybe good; watch out for Sallie Mae,It's good to get info on financing college. I haven't bought this book. Read the book but don't get a Sallie Mae loan. You need to read the online reviews of all the people trying to payoff their Sallie Mae loans. It is terrifying. I wish I knew before hand. I would have tried to get another type of loan or use my credit card to pay for it. Found out too late.
3,Helpful,"This book was a little helpful and we did learn a lot from it. For the price it is worth the money. So if you have a HS Senior, its worth the investment"
5,I Adore This Book,"This is my first review on Amazon, and I am giving it to the book ""Dear Enemy"".This book just happened to catch my eye as I was leaving the Christian section of Borders. I had given up hope on finding something to read, when lo and behold, the book just kinda. . popped out to me. I read the back, and fell in love with the plot.The story itself is great, yet heartbreaking at the same time. I have previously been a fan of Jack Cavanaugh and was not dissapointed this time.Yet, like other readers, I was a bit frustrated with the ending. She rushes all over Europe to find Karl, and when he finally shows up, it ends! As a writer, I can see why he probably did this. If you wanted her to marry Stan, she married Stan. If you wanted her to end up with Karl, she ended up with Karl.All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this type of fiction"
3,I've been waiting to read this...,"I just finished this book today, and I have to say I am slightly disappointed. It seemed as if the author rushed the ending. I also wish there was more meat to the story: I found myself looking for more after I read it. Some parts of the story were rather predictable; that wasn't a bad thing, though.There are, however, some very meaningful messages in the story. They make reading it worthwhile.And it is light, enjoyable reading, so at least I didn't feel as if I read all of that for nothing."
1,Capzasin cream,"After shipping charges,UK vat and the post office 8 handling charge (for adding vat!), the tiny tube cost over 25. And didn't work.It is supposed to create a powerful burning sensation which,eventually,reduces pain.Presumably, the effect varies from person to person - for me, it did nothing, no burning feeling, even with the application of hot pads.Maybe I'm just unlucky."
2,Cute but no detail,"I bought this book for the birth of my 2nd son after reading the reviews and liking the actual story book. However, when I received the book I was very disappointed. The pages are covered with cute pictures and sayings but it didn't have much for you to actual record about your baby. It didn't allow you to go into detail and write about your feelings or details about events, it just gave blanks for you to put in what month something was accomplished. It would be fine for someone who don't want specific dates or details about the milestones their baby reaches, but I wanted more than it offered. I returned it and purchased the updated version of Little Suzy's Zoo baby book, which is what I had with my first son, and I love it."
2,Would not buy again,"Although this book is very cute and doesn't go overboard recording every move the baby makes, it leaves out important info. There's no place to record gifts/baby showers or visitors to the hospital or home after the baby is born. One reason I rushed to get a book was so I could start recording the baby gifts we're receiving but this book was no help."
5,Cute and Easy to fill out Baby Book,"This is my 2nd child and I wanted something that is sweet but also very simple to complete. There are spaces for all the major memories and a few more. If you want something with more spaces to write detailed memories, you could write in the margins, write in your own journal, or just get a different baby book."
2,Good Book; Terrible Binding,"I just finished my second copy of this Bible. So, how can a Christian EVER finish with a Bible? Answer: when its binding is as bad as this one. Granted, I am a pastor and I use this bible every day. But I do not bend it backwards or shake it around when I preach - and it's a good thing, because pages would fly everywhere! Both bibles have lasted 18 months. I will now try Zondervan's version, which has the EXACT same pagination and typesetting, hoping that they have bound it better than Broadman and Holman."
5,A beautiful compact Bible,"Classic, British Tan, Bonded Leather, Antique Spine and slide tab closure. This is a beautiful compact Bible. The leather is such a fine grade that almost everyone that sees it ask me about it. Yes even non-believers! I have found this to be a great ice breaker. I paid the full price in book store for this Bible. It has been worth every penny."
5,Royalty Chafer,"This product was exactly what I was looking for, and was delivered on a timely basis."
1,Got peanutbutter?,"These cookies were not good to me. I love peanut butter, and these cookieshad none. Make your own and save your money."
5,m2m eyeball 2 : hot fun never ends,FANTASTIC: this is the best m2m i have seen.the boys finally got past showing everything in the videos.2nd/3th/4th films of the 5 film series are the best.YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GREATLY AS I HAVE.
1,awful,"one of the worst video ever made, bad plot bad acting bad from start to finish, do not recommend it"
4,Ho-hum...good but not great...,"...it might have been a bad omen that the release date was 01 June but SNW7 was not available until late June. The story ideas had promise (the repercussions of cadet Kirk's ""solution"" to the Kobayshi Maru, tribble thinking, Kirk & McCoy dealing w/post-traumatic shock after Rura Pente, Juliana leaving Noonien Soong, the first meeting btwn Keiko & Chief O'Brien) but the endings left me wanting. It wasn't til the final section (Speculations) that my favorite stories appeared: the Horta guarding the Guardian of Forever, Dax gets an assist from an old friend, and how the Borg came to be. A good read but not as good as SNW5 or 6..."
2,Here are a couple of comments/suggestions....,"Number 01: ""Guardians"" should have won the grand prize - NOT ""Life's Work"". Number 02: let's have more DS9 and Enterprise stories, O.K.? Number 03: let's have a couple of TNG stories that feature Tasha Yar and a couple of VGR stories that are pre-7 of 9. I think that the editors receive enough stories to meet this request. Number 04: ENOUGH stories dealing with the aftermath of Star Trek: Generations and enough stories dealing with the theoretical origins of the Borg. Number 05: stop writing stories that have already been written - the meeting of Miles and Keiko O'Brien has already been written in the TNG novel ""All Good Things...."" Number 06: let's have stories that feel like they have ended. A lot of the stories in this volume feel as though they are incomplete at the end."
1,Do not buy from this company,These crooked publishers have come out with the scam of the century preying on young talent and printing along with it horrible misrepresentations of poetry... They publish your poem which they get by you entering into a contest and calling you a semifinalist then after you get all hyped up they get you to buy the over priced volume and charge you an arm and a leg for extras and shipping. I am sure there are many fine poets in these books and if you are reading i wish you the best of luck.
2,Poets Beware,"If you want to be charged an excessive amount for vanity publications you can do no better than to purchase volumes of Poetry under the heading of The International Library of Poetry.This volume contains some good work but unfortunately the contributors probably succumbed to the hype of the massive mailings. Don't take my word for it, research Barbara Walters' story on the net about said organization and make up you own mind."
1,Beware of Ratings - Some May Not Be What They Appear,"The first review of 5 stars titled ""A Great Novelty, July 18, 2001 Reviewer: Corey Blaine from Idaho"" is stated word-for-word from the advertising flyer from poetry.com that I am holding in my hand.I would be hesitant to accept a review from someone copying from the flyer."
1,vanity press,"These people will publsih anything, as long as you agree to buy their books. Try it yourself, submit a poem at poetry.com. Make it really bad, I bet they'll write telling you they think it's the best things since Blake."
5,A Great Novelty,"The Foutain of Peace is a great book of poetry. It is a large collection of amateur poetry.The book is a heirloom-quality publication usint the finest materials and crafsmanship; 8.5"" x 11"" hardbound, approximately 300 pages.A literary resouce for public and academic libraries, recording companies, worldwide news media.A fully indexed sorcebook of poetic talent to be used by editors and publishers.This book is definitely a superb collection of over 1,500 poems on every topic.Look for previously relased titles that are highly sought-after volumes:The Promise of Dawn, A symphony of Verse, Tranquil Rains of Summer, Star Dust in the Morning, Secrects of the Soul, Return to Forever, Guided by voices,A truly enjoable reading experiance and guiede to aspiring poets and songwriters."
3,Crap,"Save your money. This dvd is boring, poor quality film. Unless you competed at this event or know someone who did you'll probably want to skip this."
2,Better then the first CD,"The first CD was worth one star for its opening track. The second effort ""Exercises"" gets two stars for another great opening track ""I Will Not Be Led"" and two great country ditties ""Cat's Eye"" and ""Fool About You""Alas, ""I will not be led"" could have been really great but misguided use of the dreaded fuzz box effect on the guitar really dates this tune. The two country songs mentioned above are very fun if somewhat silly and have great bouncy acoustic guitar strumming by Manny. However if you are looking for a ""razamanaz"" style tune in this collection you will be sorely disapointed!!The band was obviously struggling with its musical direction on the first two albums and thankfully Roger Glover from Deep Purple saved the day by producing their next album ""Razamanaz"" and the hard rockers never looked back, and that is the place to start your collection!"
4,An Emotional Read,"I recently discovered this author and find her books fascinating in that they aren't typical. This story is emotional, the hero strong and gritty. I found the love story touching in that it wasn't predictable. If you are tired of the usual fluff, give this author a try."
3,Can Bryn resist her husband?,"Leaving her husband, Sheikh Kahlil al-Assad, was the most difficult thing Bryn ever did. Now, three years later, she's shocked when he walks back into her life...Kahlil clearly hasn't forgiven Bryn for abandoning her marriage vows, and when he discovers he has also missed the first three years of his son's life, he's even more determined to take revenge. This means using the intense sexual chemistry that still exists between them! Will Bryn be able to resist her husband...and then will he be able to walk away ?"
2,Not so great,"I have read two of Jane Porter's books before this one: The Sultan's Bought Bride and Duty, Desire, and the Desert King. They are both really good books. I bought this one expecting it to be just as good. It wasn't.I saw a preview a few years ago of a movie called ""Not Without My Baby."" The preview was so upsetting that I didn't see the movie, although I'm sure the movie was gripping and thought-provoking. Part of this book reminded me of that upsetting preview and was hard to read. I'm also not sure that the changes in the characters' desires and personalities rang true. Yes, there was some great sexual tension, but all in all the book was quite disappointing.I look forward to reading more of Jane Porter's books - hopefully the next one I read will be more rewarding like the other two I mentioned above. As for this one, I will probably give it away so that I don't waste my time again reading it."
3,Very challenging and fast,"Most back-pain related DVDs are slow and conservative - this is fast and very aggressive. It's nicely done, but not something you'd recommend to someone over 50 or with serious back issues."
4,Sounds like 'Avatar'?,"I have a copy of this book, which I haven't read yet. However, reading the 'blurb'..it does sound a lot like the plot-line from the movie Avatar, or am I incorrect?"
3,"Good, but a bit overlong","I enjoyed this book, although (having read feminist sci-fi since the 70s) there were no surprises here. In addition, it was quite a bit too long with long stretches where nothing happened to advance the plot or develop the characters. I also was amazed to find that the main ""love interests"" were between males and females, despite the fact that most of the story takes place on an all-female planet. Female partners are discretely referred to as 'love sharers' with very little more said about that.Oh well, I suppose I'm nitpicking since, all in all, it was a good story with interesting characters."
2,The Lost Tomb of Jesus,"I've watched ths doc. Interesting. I keep my mind opened. Eventhough Jesus is really married & has son, He is still my HERO bcs it's true tht He gave His live for the humanity: love thy neighbours/ treat others as we want to be treated and the love from God is like a father to his son. The Jewish are the first people in the world embraced monotheism. At tht time people around the world still lived in dark ages. They believed God(s) is/ are very sacred. Only high priests able to communicate wth them and people have to do human sacriface to satisfy them.Eventhough Jesus was given last chance to defent himself (which could give him a chance to be free) in front of Pontius Pilate but He choosed to quiet & surender to His destiny. It's like a father who was tortured by his enemy to reveal where is his son/ family hiding."
3,Lacking Hard Evidence - Too Hollywood,"Very good production value. Seemingly solid evidence, but highly debated conclusions. Also, several of the 'key evidences' provided by the experts in this documentary were recanted by the very experts who made them. Most significantly the mathematical probability for this being THE tomb of the biblical Jesus was watered down significantly following the airing of this production (see rebuttal to this in the comments section by one of the experts).Also, having now watched several episodes of 'The Naked Archaeologist' which follow the archaeological exploits of Simcha Jacobovici (same individual who leads the expedition on the Talpoit tomb), I must say that I am not at all impressed by his 'fly by the seat of his pants' methods for diliniating archaeological data. He appears to have very little respect for the location of the digs and sites he visits -- a bit like a bull in a china shop."
4,"Fun, goofy Franch rock from the early 1960s","This French band took its cues from Elvis Presley and Chubby Checker, twisting the night away and covering numerous American rock tunes with goofy French translations, much like Johnny Hallyday in his early career. It's dorky, but fun -- better, actually, than many similar French rock acts. Worth checking out!(This review written by DJ Joe Sixpack, of Slipcue.com)"
1,"Predictable, dull and unoriginal",This kind of book demonstrates what is wrong with academic philosophy. Why do publishers bother? If you want to deepen your understanding of the emotions then don't waste your money or time on this book. Save it for something written by Robert Solomon or Martha Nussbaum.
2,I really give 2.5 stars but it won't let me,"Like the caption says I really give it 2.5 stars, not 2. It's not hard to use and it works but it doesn't exactly do what I thought it would. I thought it would make spaghetti-like strands instead it makes curly fetuccini (thin strips) which is not horrible but I can basically do that with a potato peeler for 3 bucks. I was going to return it but I am stuck with it now because some tomato juice got on the long pin and ate away at the fake metal veneer before I realized it was there and had a chance to clean it. Should be priced at 6 bucks, I know $17.00 is not a lot but when you include shipping..I just feel it's mediocre for the money spent. Also annoyed with Amazon b/c I was supposed to get free shipping (yes I know they don't care and are not reading this) on my multi-item order which was over $25. I will gift this to some poor college student raw vegan and look for a better version."
5,I LOVE THIS SLICER!!!,"Since the slicer arrived, I've been making all kinds of raw spaghettis! I plan to make some raw korean noodles as well, and this is excellent way to do that. Very easy to clean, and very fun to use! I highly recommend this for anyone who is new to the whole raw foods world; it makes eating raw vegetables even more fun!"
3,Great for zuccini but won't hold up to raw beets,"I love spiralized golden beets in a salad, and the occasional radish. This spiralizer is good, but after about 1.5 years it's breaking down. I think a better choice would have been the benringer (Japanese) one, as it has all metal parts. But if you aren't sure you will be spiralizing your veggies for years to come, this one is fine. Also, if you only use it for making zuccini noodles like in raw pasta, you will probably be fine for a few more years."
1,Product Changed By Manufacturer - Not what it used to be,"I purchased a Joyce Chen Spiral Slicer last year and loved it for making wonderful angel hair ""pasta"" from zucchini, in fact I loved this gadget so much I recently bought six more to give as gifts to family and friends. Was then very upset when I opened one of the ""new"" slicers and tried to use it only to discover that the manufacturer had changed the unit and replaced the metal shredding blade with a plastic ""blade"". I believe they may have had liability concerns about the sharpness of the metal blade but the problem with plastic ""blade"" is that it isn't sharp enough and just makes mush instead of the lovely ""pasta"" it used to make. I tried it several times using very firm zucchini and it was a mess each time. I wish they'd go back to the old model since this one just doesn't work."
2,Plastic Saladacco,"This is so frustrating. Some Saladaccos come with all metal blades, like it should. Mine, on the other hand, came with a plastic shredding blade. The Saladacco creates beautiful spiral slices, but it also can make thin strips from those spirals with the additional blades. Well, my additional blades are little plastic rivots...It can't even shred a zucchini. My mom bought 2, 1 came with the plastic piece, the other with the good metal piece. WTF? And there is no way of knowing which you'll get! The metal one is great. The plastic one sucks."
5,spiral slicer,"Great product! At first it was confusing,however, after watching a utube how-to video it became very easy. Zucchini is my favorite!"
1,I can't get it to work!,"Hi, I need help! I cannot get this to work correctly. I've tried to make spirals with beets and with carrots. They don't come out spiraled, rather in bits. Am I doing it correctly? I bought another at the some time to give as a gift, but don't want to now because I can't get it to work! I'd like to send them both back.Thanks, Kathleen"
1,More trouble than its worth,"This product is cheaply made. One day I hope I will learn how to handle this finicky product just so I don't feel like I completely wasted my money. For a product with such a specified purpose, I would have thought it would work, but it is NOT well designed. Don't throw away your money on this."
3,Spiral slicer,Works pretty good once you get your vegetable to stay on the small prongs. Vegetables have to be fairly straight and not curved.
1,Save your money and avoid this!,"AA real disappointment, this spiral slicer is cheaply made and fails to perform reliably and adequately. It can be used best on large chunks of such vegetables as carrots, zucchini and cucumber, but forget about smaller or slender pieces, or small vegetables such as radishes, which it just can't seem to process at all. It also produces a great of waste. You also have to be careful that it doesn't come apart in your hands as you turn the crank. While it does (when you can get it to work) produce pretty strands and spirals (it has two different settings), its reliability and limitations make this a poor choice for the consumer. You'd be better off investing in a good-quality mandoline or a food processor (or purchasing an affordable Microplane grater)."
1,So bad driven me to write a review,"I guess if all you ever want to spiralize is zucchini your OK, partly. I was very excited to get this to unyuckify my raw food dinners. First night I cut up my zucchini, used it without trouble and had a great set of noodles. Then I put the second piece in. A piece without skin on the top and all this thing did was make circles in the top of the zucchini, didn't spin it at all. A bit disappointing but still had a plate of noodles from half a zucchini. Next night I got a little crazy, tried a piece of butternut squash. This thing totally failed AND the plastic grippers that are supposed to hold the veggie BROKE OFF so now the whole top is useless and I have to spin my zucchini by hand until I replace it with a unit that works. Place your expectation for a good product elsewhere."
4,Check first the adjusting of the blade (the large one)...,"unless you may spend a struggling time trying whithout success to obtain a result ! I could not obtain any result till I unscrewed the blade so to enlarge the thickness of the ""noodles"". Magically it could at last work instantly when I did that.It is a shame that the manufacturer does not mention this essential information on the ""instructions of use"" along with the other useful one."
4,Handy Tool,"I would recommend this to anyone that wants to make angle hair pasta from zucchini. I have not used it for any other veggies, but I'm sure it would do fine. Only drawback is the threaded shaft will rust if left."
4,Make the best hashbrowns ever!!,I love this!! I have never seen a machine that will make such thread-like thin strips!! I can make a potato stretch out for enough hash browns for 4 people!! really! not kidding!I love it!The only thing I'd like to see is it to have a larger bowl to catch the veggies.
1,Poorly designed,It does not cut zucchini into spaghetti-like strips as advertised. I've used other spiral cutters and this one won't do it. The blades are too short...save your money.
2,Waste of Money,"New to raw food and excited about making zucchini ""spaghetti,"" I bought this item at the recommendation of several people. You need to have great strength to push down and turn the handle simultaneously; the food needs to be ""perfect"" as far as how it's cut, the length, width, etc.; there is always big chunks of food left over. They say you can use any fruit/veg as long as it's the right size, but cucumber just makes a huge, gloppy mess. Big regrets."
5,Spiral Slicer,I was very happy with this product when I used it. It is easy to use and clean up. Makes cutting up vegetables easy and attractive. I would recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of slicer.
4,You have to watch a tutorial for correct use..,"I bougth this item because i saw some recepies with zucchini spagetti and because i dont eat to much carbs any more i couldn't wait to buy it, i saw first some review about how difficult it is to use it and some others that is excelent, so i bougt it and my first experience was defenitly awful, i couldn't use it at all but i said to me "" well if there's other people that could use it i can!!!"" so i search in youtube for a tutorial and i was like "" ooohh so that's how U use it"" and then voala!! was so much easer and i ate my first zucchini spaggeti that was delicious by the way. so i recomend it but you have to watch a tutorial!!"
3,Not real happy with my purchase,"I was very excited to buy the spiral slicer, as I had seen it being used in a demonstration at a health food store. I got the slicer in a few days and could not wait to use it. I found that the blade is very small and you have to put alot of pressure on the handle in order for it to slice. I consider the quality of the item to only be fair and don't think this item will hold together igf used again and again. I get very frustrated every time I go to use it."
3,Handy Tool,"This is a tool for the occasional user. If you are want a few extra vegetables in your diet, want some interesting looking salads then this is fine. For people on a raw food diet I do not recommend this product. Something sturdier and with more options for cutting would be better.PROS: Easy, simple clean up. Small size easy for storage. Simple to use. Inexpensive.CONS: Can only cut one size of the ""spaghetti"" noodles, stains very easy with vegetables. (For my first time using it I cut a carrot. It was stained immediately.) For harder vegetables you need some muscle."
1,"Cheaply made, broken, blade was very inconsistent at cutting","One plastic tooth broke during shipping, the screws were stripped and would not properly assemble, instructions were terrible and the blade does a horribly inconsistent job of cutting noodles! Some have to be pulled apart by hand, and certain softer or more water-filled vegetables will not cut into ""noodles"" at all.Buy the spirooli instead."
2,It is a lot of work and very little to show for it,"I am really looking for a vegetable slicer to give me those thin strands that look like spaghetti, but this one is WAY too much work...if anyone knows of a solid vegetable slicer, like the ones they use in restaurants, please post! Blessings! This one is not IT."
1,The Biggest Piece of Junk I have ever used,"I thought that it couldn't be as bad as the other reviewers had written. Now I know that if you could have chosen zero stars, you would have. I have never, ever seen such a piece of junk that doesn't come even close to doing what it says it can do."
4,I love it,"I know this gadget has gotten some mixed reviews. I love it. It is easy to use, easy to store and makes incredible speghetti strands. The drawbacks are, and that is why I gave it 4 stars, it is a very simple gadget. Even though it is not the sturdiest piece,it works great for what it is intended to do .I only use it to shred zucchinni and potatoes, and it does it easily in seconds and the clean up takes less than a minute. So, I highly recommend it to make no carb pasta from raw zucchini and easy to shred potato strands to cook for potato pancakes ( much easier and less messy than grating) Also, your hands never get dirty. Take it for what it is, a simple helpful gadget. I consider it one of my best gadgets."
2,Saladacco Spiral Slicer,"It's not quite what we thought it would be, the quality is not the best, it will not withstand lot's of spiraling!"
2,broken blades,I got at least 4 spiral slicer because I give them as abirthday presents . I do like the product except that the blades come out and they brake. so it turns out to be a very expensive item cause you cant replace the blade.3 out of the 4 have broken blades except for one that is still new inside of the box.Seems like theres no place where you can complain about the product or have the blade replace.
2,"Feels like a toy that will not last, does not do the job well either",The setting for spiral spaghetti cut is not tight so it constantly goes to slicing as ribbons- specially is you want to spaghetti from yams or something that is not ultra soft. it is flimsy and does not hold the vegetable in place well either.
3,its o.k.,"I read some of the reviews and I think this product is OK. It does seem cheap, considering shipping and handling I would not recommend it."
3,Decent,"This product is decent for those who are new to spiral slicing and gets the job done. It can become frustrating at times when trying to get a grip on the vegetables once in the container, but it works."
5,"Joyce Chen 51-0662, Saladacco Spiral Slicer, White","Love being about to make thin spiral threads with beets and squash. Cucumbers make ribbons. It is a great product for everyone, but especially vegetable lovers."
3,LOVE IT...hate it?,"One of my favorite kitchen tools ever!! But it rusted by the first few uses and dulls fast too ;( I would buy another if the quality lasted but after less then 10 times i'd say it needed replacement, which I can't afford"
3,I must be lucky,I bought this and it does a great job 80&% bof the time.. sometimes I end up with this 2 inch wide flat piece of striated zuchini coming out but for the most part it's been pretty decent. Yes it does require you start with it centered and flat but I've even worked past the squared off thing for the most part. It does require even firm pressure as you turn the handle..maybe no for a person with tendonitis.PeaceRoy
1,"No, no, no, no!","I was told it would make hard vegetables, like squash, into pasta like strands. It sort of makes little, almost hair thin, strands within a larger one I could have used a regular vegetable peeler for. On my first use, about 6 of the little pegs broke off of the round disc into the squash. This product did not do what I thought it would do and is easily breakable. I would NOT recommend buying this product. Mine is sitting in the back of my cupboard."
1,FALLS APART AFTER 1 MONTH AND IT'S RUSTING!!!,I'm very disappointed in this slicer. It is VERY cheaply made! After only a month of occasional use the blade just fell out and won't stay in now and it's rusting in spots (where the metal is of course). I am beyond disappointed because I need it for my new raw foods lifestyle. I didn't mind that I had to hand wash it or cut my vegetables in half to use it but now it's rusting and useless because it's falling apart! BUY A BETTER MODEL.
1,Saladacco spiral slicer,"I have to complain about this product. I've had mine about 6 months and purchased it specifically to make zucchini angel hair pasta....which is about the only use for this very cheap plastic item, and unfortuantely I paid in the $30 range. I used it tonight again, and yes there's a rediculous amount of Zucchini I end up using my grater for because of the limitations on the size of the piece this unit will hold. I've tried using this unit about 15 times and it's been a struggle every time, and tonight a piece of plastic in the upper turning unit broke. I plan on dumping this very poorly made item and investing in a substantial, and yes much more expensive, but reliable vegetable spiral unit. I do not recommend this to anyone."
2,Spiral Slicer does not meet expectations.,"I am not terribly impressed. I was informed that this gadget would make ""spaghetti"" out of zucchini. All I can get is grooves in the spiral slices. I would be pleased if the cutters would go all the way through, like the ads say they will. The spiral slices are lovely, though..."
1,Poorly written,"This book was written by scholarly individuals but I suggest you read the first couple of pages online before you purchase this book. You will see what I mean.I am sure people fully conversant in English sentence structure and grammar will be able to glean some information but for the average high school student this will confound you. More time should have been spent adding examples of the topic being discussed. When explaining a new language, brevity should be set aside and complete, expansive explanations should be the rule."
4,GREAT SHOES,"THESE SHOES ARE WONDERFUL. I LOVE RYKA SHOES. I WORK IN A MOTORCYCLE SHOP AND AM CONSTANTLY RUNNING AROUND OR UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS. THESE HAVE THE SAME AMAZING CUSHIONING AND SUPPORT AS THE FULL FOOTED SHOES. THE TOP ELASTIC BAND IS A LITTLE TIGHT UNTIL BROKEN IN, BUT THAT'S MY ONLY COMPLAINT. THEY STAY ON AND GIVE ME THE RELIEF IN NEED ON A BUSY DAY."
1,Faulty digital Camera Accessory Kit,"I agree with another reviewer-the Fuji Camera is excellent, but the charger in the accessory kit was faulty-2 batteries wouldn't even charge. The camera was a gift to our 20 year old son and he was devastated when the 2 rechargeable batteries that worked melted the camera's face plate! Even for free (it was included in the camera price as an extra bonus around Christmas time) it was not a bargain!"
1,Faulty batteries!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this kit as a gift for my husband. Two of the batteries would not even charge, and one of them actually ""melted"" it's outside casing!!! We are returning the whole kit, and will purchase rechargeables separately. Shame on Fuji for even throwing together such a ... kit!!!"
1,I'm now on the THIRD kit. First two had faulty chargers.,"Like almost everyone else who purchased this accessory kit, I wanted it primarily for the rechargeables. Digital Cameras eat disposable batteries at an alarming rate. Amazon threw in kit for free on some of the cameras I was looking at which made the FinePix A201 I bought a steal.The tripod is worthless. This was not a great buy."
1,A waste of money - I'm returning mine,The tripod is not as pictured - it is a very cheap flimsy wire thing.In my instance the rechargable batteries and charger were faulty - I know rechargables get hot but the first (and only) time I charged them these ones melted their casings and the charger. And they didn't work at all!The case fits my A101 nicely with an extra memory card but is not worth buying this package for.
1,Horrible,Basically I just paid for the rechargable batteries. The case barely fits my Fuji FinePix 1300 and the 'tripod' is not what is pictured in the photo. It's some cheesy bendable wire thing. I was a bit disappointed with the kit.Actually I just revised my review. The batteries that came with this kit doesn't even hold a charge. I think this kit has been sitting in their warehouse for too long. I am returning the whole kit.
2,Love the original -- this edited version is not so great,"I LOVE the original text of the Pursuit of God. There are some amazing and challenging stretches of writing in the book that are well-worth quoting. However, after reading this edited version, I realize that the flow of the original book is also needed to truly appreciate Tozer's words and ideas.I used this book for a women's small group and it served us pretty well. Unfortunately, I don't think the women walked away with the same appreciation for Tozer's writing that they would have if we had read the original book.Buy the original instead!"
5,Excellent and life changing book,"I have many books by Tozer. This one is my favorite. I have learned more from this book than any other book or devotional than any other I've read, except the best book, The Bible. My womens Bible group is going to be studying this book together over the summer. I have been challenged, and changed by the insights here."
3,Extra quotations were distracting,"I agree with the 2 star reviewer in what she said, however I would give the book one more star or 1-1/2 more if I could because after all it was still Tozer. I found that the editing did affect the impact of the book (having read the original), but moreover, the constant insertion of quotes from other sources (or even Tozer himself from his other works) was extremely distracting. I think if the book was read without the quotes it would have been much better, but then you may as well just get the original."
5,Rice Brand,The rice brand I received from Amazon is great. I use some every day. I am pleased with this product and I will continue to order more.
2,Guess I'll be the Bad Cop,"Sorry - I wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't. I tried, but I kept having visions of all those horrible Harlequin Books my mother used to read when I was a kid. That maybe is not fair - this book strives for more ... but it is just a little too much. Proceed with caution."
1,NOT SATISFIED,WHEN I ORDERED THIS BOOK I REALLY DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE THAT LONG FOR THE BOOK TO COME. I ORDERED IT ON 2-28 AND WAS SUPPOSE TO GET IT 3-22 AND I NEVER RECIEVED IT SO I ASKED FOR A REFUND THAT WAS THE ONLY QUICKEST THING I HAVE GOTTEN FROM THIS OREDER.
2,"Good Book but,",This is my first time buying a school book from Amazon and I wouldn't do it again. I did receive the book in time but then I had to return it because I couldn't take the class any longer. I had the book for about 7 days and then retuned it. I only got half of the price I paid because I took off the wrapper. The book was Brand New. I will never buy a book from Amazon again.
3,"Good coverage, LOTS of typos!","Though this book is a great introduction to special education, I was surprised by the number of technical errors and typos it contained. I'd say I found at least 2-3 in each chapter! Certainly this doesn't affect the quality of the information, but when I read a textbook (particularly when I pay as much as I did for this one), I expect a thoroughly professional presentation. I was quite unimpressed with whoever did the text editing for this book. I also hate books that have lots of margin notes (the kind that are meant to act as a 'quick find' tool), extra text boxes, etc. - it makes it much more difficult to read sequentially."
3,Pages missing - Publisher was not helpful - Amazon replaced book,"Bought 10th edn from Amazon. Realized pages 482 - 514 were missing just two days before the test. Called Pearson (publisher). They were absolutely unaccommodating. Then called Amazon, who replaced the book by next day delivery."
2,Exceptional Learners 11th Edition- Not All Components Included,"I was disappointed after I bought this book, because I ended up having to buy another copy (for $170) at my university bookstore. The version that I bought at the university bookstore came in a shrink-wrapped package containing the book, a cd-rom, and a supplemental text. I needed all three of these components for my class, and the book that I bought from amazon.com did not have the cd-rom or the supplemental texts. So, if you need these components, be sure to find out from the buyer if they are included in your purchase."
4,Very informative and interesting.,"Personally, I think the majority of textbooks are boring but NOT this one. This one is very informative and interesting. I'm actually going to keep it for future reference versus my usual of selling it back."
3,Exceptional Learners: An introduction To Special Education,"I receive the text book in good time, but the cases for reflection was not included with the book. I was very disappointed, as I needed it for the class."
3,Good Information,This book contains a lot of good informantion and the author is good at making his ideas make sense. It loses 2 stars because it is written in the horrible APA format which makes it very difficult to read.
4,Special Needs,A well written book addressing the plite of children with special needs. It is design for people who are not acquainted with the struggle that parent's had and are still having for their children to enter mainstream classrooms. It is also for future teachers that are intimidated by the issues concerning Special Education.
4,Learning about Exceptionalities,"This book does a nice job bringing awareness to special education issues. It brings in a strong sense of the human factor. Children with different gifts, abilities, and disabilities are foremost children. Exceptional Learners is current and informative. It helps the reader understand who these children are and how to reach them. This is an excellent resource for those not familiar with exceptional learners."
3,Exceptional Learners textbook,Good book for learning about educational systems and how they deal with disabilities. Provides great stories and examples.
3,A JUMBLE OF THREAD AND THRUM,"I expected a more systematic and comprehensive book, but in vain. I expected a voluminous and exhaustive work, but in vain. I was extremely astonished at the scantiness of space on Japanese same-sex relationship.Among numberless Japanese male love literal works only Akinoyononaga monogatari is translated. Many famous homoerotical stories and historical episodes are omitted. Although this is an interesting book and I don't hesitate to recommend it , I must indicate that it is only an anthological theses collection et meager in content."
2,Small Quilts with Vintage Charm - Jo Morton,"I just received this book and what a disappointment. Both front & back covers show quilts in bright, clear colors. But inside the book itself, all photos of the quilts throughout the project pages are very poor; they are very dark, nothing like the cover photos. When you ""Look inside this book"" on Amazon, the photos on the inside of the book are not available for viewing. If they had been, I would not have purchased this book. The paper used inside the book also is sub-standard, not the quality at all of what I am used to finding in a quilt book. The publisher is C&T Publishing but the book itself was printed in China. Is nothing made in the USA anymore??????"
5,The Best Peeler Ever!!!!,"I LOVE this peeler. The serrated edge allows it to pierce the skin of fruits and veggies and it just glides along so nicely. Also, the metal eye remover on the end works very well, much better than peelers with plastic eye removers. I know they call it a ""soft-skin"" peeler, but I've used it on potatoes and apples and eggplant with beautiful results. Since we got it, we now fight over who gets to peel the veggies! That never happened before!"
4,nice,"This is a great peeler. It ships with a little plastic cover that shields the point and the blade. It would be nice for that to be able to clip on so you can keep it. Otherwise, really nice, comfortable, does what it's supposed to."
5,Amazing!,"I couldn't imagine why people could be so in love with a kitchen device, until I bought this peeler! It is truly amazing - I use it on peaches, pears, ginger, tomatoes, etc. and it works even on overripe fruit. Not only a time-saver, but a fruit-saver as well, since only the thin peel is removed. Be careful - the blade is very sharp (I wish I had saved the plastic blade cover as another review did). Excellent product!"
2,Zyliss Soft Skin Peeler,I am disappointed in the product. Maybe I don't know exactly how to use the peeler. I will continue to try.
4,Worth buying,"I started doing pilates in a community college class this summer. I found it hard to keep it up after the class ended and so decided to get this DVD. Overall, it's pretty good. I've only done mat workouts on it and will update when I try the others.The exercises for mat workouts are pretty good. It has some exercises we didn't cover in my class and leaves out a bunch, but you can't have everything jam packed in there right? You can mix and match your workout or do an extra long one by doing a bunch of workouts available in the dvd.Megan White, or whoever the lady is, is calm while being enthusiastic without going overboard. She does go a bit too fast sometimes, so don't hesitate to hit the pause button. Better to do it right and do it slow than strained yourself.As for the level, I think it's best for people who have tried pilates already, even though she does have an introduction section for the exercises.I'd recommend this item"
4,Challenging workout,"This is the best Pilates DVD I've tried. Although, the instructor is a little too happy at times, I really do enjoy her workout method. It is clear and easy to follow. You really ""feel the burn"" once you're done with this one. Plus, it has many workouts on this one DVD to let you pick and choose what area of your body you want to focus on."
3,Pretty good,"I like that this DVD has a lot of different work out options, but it doesn't seem very challenging. If you work out regularly, this DVD will probably be to easy for you. I'm going to look for an advanced Pilates DVD."
3,It was just okay,"I like my ""Hilary"" pilates tape better. I just didn't get the workout I thought I was going to get with it, but will use it for the short workouts. They were helpful. If there was a 2.5 stars, I give it that."
4,Pleasant Surprise,This is a very good DVD. Multiple routines to choose from. Each can be as easy or as challenging as you want. I was looking for a challenge and was pleasanty surprised that this DVD did provde me with a good challenging set of workouts. My daughter (an 18 yr. old competitive swimmer) and I do these workouts together and even she says that she can feel results!!
5,Excellent,This is a excellent Cd with a lot of variety . You will see results if you use this cd faithfully. The only one down side I found Megan White's voice is annoying if you can get pass that you will LOVE this CD!
5,Great Workout DVD,"This really works well to get you into shape. It is a nice mixture of various pilates exercises brokwn down into workouts that are 15 minutes or less and over 15 minutes. There is a wide range of workout combinations using variouss items, mat, weights, large ball, small ball, ring. There is a short pilates lesson, and also a modified pilates flow workout, to get you started with pilates to some degree, though it is more of a workout DVD than a strict ""how to"" do pilates DVD. But working with the lessons and modified workout a few times worked out fine for me to get ready for the rest of the DVD. Definately a great set of workouts. If you are totally new to pilates you may want a beginners DVD to start or supplement this DVD, but you will want this DVD later on for what it gives you."
4,So much fun!!,"I bought this for my one year old, and he is over two now and still loves these cars, airplanes, trucks and helicpoters. Easy to clean and lots of fun!!"
1,severely lacking,"This book, while perhaps being the most up-to-date card list when it was first published, is nowhere near as updated today. Perhaps the publishers will come out with a new book that truly is a complete (as of the time it is published) list of every card out there."
5,ULTRA MEGA SUPER NINJA COOL!!,"This thing RULES ALL! It's extremely simple to use. Start it up when you computer acts sticky or schedule it to keep your PC running in top shape. Norton AntiVirus, which is included, found one virus on my system which my updated McAfee Virus Scan did not. Norton AntiVirus auto protect scans incoming and outgoing email for viruses so it's next to impossible to contract or spread anything. Combine that with Norton's easy to configure Firewall and Live update and you've got a safe, optimized system."
2,Decent products...service is another techno-bureaucracy,"I have probably owned a dozen or more Symantec products. They are always decent to great, and the SystemWorks/Firewall bundle is very good. I agree that the programs are too hungry for resources at times. But, I 'm feeling pretty grumbly with Symantec for their crummy upgrade policy. I bought the 2001 version a couple of months ago, and now find myself paying list price again to upgrade because I moved to Windows XP."
2,Symantec Has Let Us Down,"I've owned Sytemworks since the first day it came on the market.As to Symantec's Firewall, well, forget it. You can get free firewalls online at places like zone.com that are much, much better. Symantec's firewall gets in the way of everything you do, from short documentary files to graphics.Systemworks is okay, but when applied to XP, it isn't yet as operable or friendly as it was with 98 or 2000."
3,looks impressive but looks can be deceiving,"Having Norton Antivirus does not totally protect you from viruses(but what does)the software alerts you of such things as boot record changes which can result using windows update instead of looking for real threats. Firewall is not recommended for people with dial up connections and you will constantly get messages popping up(like now when I am trying to review this product on this site for instance) alerting you of things that aren't that bad but it seems like it with words like SECURITY RISK! Or ALERT! ALERT! when in reality it is just Amazon trying to collect information so you can get on their site. Websites collect information so viewers can post reviews and so forth do not be put off by the alarms. This is a ""cry wolf"" firewall and is not recommended by me."
1,Don't buy! Definitley NOT worth the hassle!,"I have tried it all... reinstallation, contacting Norton professionals, installing only part of the system... Every time I install Norton my computer runs at snails pace and then after about a day, it crashes. I would not recommend this program to anyone!"
4,GlowHack,"This footbag is great for any Hacky Sack enthusiast. It's Performance and feel as a footbag is nothing special, but the most important aspect of it is that YOU CAN PLAY AT NIGHT! The light works really well and has never turned off while I've used it. Even though it has a light in it, it still feels pretty close to a regular knit footbag when you hack it. I don't recommend playing with it while you are barefoot because the light switch is external and many hurt if you kick it on the the wrong side."
3,stuck on flea capture pads,"These are very sticky and we caught all sorts of critters on them. Very effective at catching fleas, flea droppings, flea eggs, and we even caught an ant."
4,Works very well,Exceeded my expectation. Worked very well. I usually turn it on in the evening and off during the day.it haskeptmy house free of fleas for nine months now. No need for chemical treatment
3,Refills need wider box,Trap is awesome! The refills were curled up at the edges due to narrowBox. Fine once the flattened out.
4,"Super sticky, holds those suckers very well.","When one of my dogs passed, we had an abundance of fleas in the house all of a sudden. They were in every room and attacked you the moment you walked in the house- gross. We tried everything we could think of, chemical wise, and finally decided to give these traps a try. As soon as I plugged them in, there were fleas jumping on. Of course, I didn't pay attention to the fact that they weren't sticking because I hadn't peeled off the adhesive cover (durr moment of the day). Once I realized that, we were good to go. I put one in each room, including by the dog bed. The amount of fleas has been greatly reduced, but the yard is another matter...We also turned them off while we went out of town for a week, and noticed more fleas when came back. We sprayed a chemical and plugged them back in, and the amount has reduced again. I'd recommend giving these a try."
3,Only 2 Pads Inside Box,Not sure if this works yet but looks like other pads I've used. BUYER BEWARE: I Purchased two boxes. Each box only contained 2 capture pads. Packets were sealed so were not lost in transit. I needed to use them NOW SO DIDN'T TAKE THE TROUBLE TO RETURN THEM.
5,Great Product,"Between the Flea Trap and vacuuming daily, I solved the flea problem.I haven't had any fleas in my home for years.I still use the Flea Trap to catch other tiny insects before they can reproduce.I live in a row home in South Philadelphia and I recommend it to anyone that has an unfinished basement.It captures more when all lights around it are turned off."
4,This will help your flea problem,"We've used these flea traps for a few years. They won't get rid of fleas completely on their own, but definately make a difference. The pads are usually covered in a few days, and need replacing. You will need to also medicate your pets, vacume frequently, and probably flea bomb every few weeks. Fleas are terribly hard to get rid of, but these flea traps are a helpful solution."
2,not worth it,We thought we caught two fleas one was an ant. And the sticky pads quickly dry out so things do not even stick anymore. also a major part of the construction s a rubber band... are you serious?don't buy. put your dog/cat on advantix or something and buy a can of bug spray. its easier and does not waste electricity.
1,Please don't fall for this like I did...,"We bought 4 of these things and I did do research but based on my experience with the product, and based on the research I ignored, THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK! Please don't waste your money on this sticky nightlight. So sorry I chose to ignore the reviews and websites that said it did not work."
1,Not worth it,I got the trap and refills for my daughter and hate it .If you really want one that works get the round one VICTOR I have both but I love the Victor one it really works.
2,poor packaging,This product was shipped in a smaller box than the image shows and the flea trap pads are now bent from being folded inside a smaller box. Usually they are shipped in a flat thin box so they are flat when you pull them out. Now they are bent and do not lie flat on the surface of the trap base which is counterproductive in catching not just fleas but any other insects crawling on the floor. I feel this product was advertized falsely in the photo and better shipping should be paramount for customer satisfaction.
5,AMAZING PRODUCT! WORKS GREAT!!,"I would recommend this product to anyone! We had an issue with one of our dog's monthly flea medication and when we brought it up to the vet, they stated that we received a ""bad batch""... We had so many fleas in the house and tried everything from flea collars, sprays and powder.. I went online and read some reviews on the Springstar Flea Trap and decided to give it a try... We are glad we did!I bought 6 traps and spread them throughout the house and after just one night, all the traps had at least 12-15 fleas in them! Amazing! We did use the flea bomb as well as a spray on various surfaces such as the couch, dog beds, etc.... We have been flea free for about 2 weeks now and I still have the flea traps plugged in for that extra protection! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that has a major flea issue down to just keeping them in your home for the summer season..."
5,THIS WORKS!!,"I brought in a cat that was left behind when her owner moved. Didn't know she had fleas!!Saw she wasn't well, (starving and dehydrated), and used to be so beautiful sitting in the window, looking at the world.These DO work... the fleas are attracted to the light/warmth, and fall thru the ""grid"" down onto thevery sticky paper!! BUSTED! VACUUMING is prime too, and their flea meds are also important. These flea traps catch many who are left - that CAN and WILL multiply!Get a supply of refills too!!"
3,Traps fleas and other small bugs,"It does attract fleas. Dog even likes to stay close to it like he thinks it may attract the fleas from him. My only question is, the light looks like an ordinary night light. Where is the special attraction? The light itself seems to be the attractant."
2,"This is a health alternative to regualer pudding, however","This product has a bitter flavor and aftertaste. It also has a whopping 26 grams of carbohydrates, mostly from sugar. Low sugar regular pudding has about 12 carbs per unit. It's higher in protein than regular and the texture is very smooth. It's just hard to get past the bitter. Had a five year old, and 7 year old refuse to eat because they didn't like it. Two other kids did like it. I bought a case, and when it's gone I won't reorder."
3,Intersting British Spy Story,"It was a little slow moving for my liking, but the storyline was interesting. Not much action if you like action flicks."
4,Enjoyable Watch,"I'm a sucker for English Spy stories ala John LeCarre'. This isn't his story but I enjoyed watching more than once. I don't like loose ends so I wish I knew what happened to Johhnie Warwick after the story finished, i.e., the ""rest of the story.""Interesting to see the interplay of Johnnie's skills as an intelligence operative and his struggles as a father and everyday person as well as the loss of his closest friend who also happens to be his boss. I was dismayed to see the triumph of his peer and the country's political leader (i.e., the ""bad guys"") but I suppose that is quite possible at the top of the intelligence community if you lose the support of your boss. I wonder how Johnnie could have put himself in a stronger position in the office politics without demeaning himself as an individual. I believe family should come first, so maybe the outcome couldn't have been any different for him.Intriguing story."
3,Tinker Tailor anyone?,"I saw this again in 2013 (a repeat on PBS) and having recently seen both Tinker Tailors, saw the interesting similarities: Nighy plays a subdued intelligent type like Alec Guiness' (or Gary Oldman's) Smiley. The mysterious spy chief sets things going and dies, Michael Gambon here, and Control there. Both main characters have problems with infidelity in their marriages. The update for Page Eight is that instead of the enemy being the USSR, its now the US (and Israel) to make things as politically correct in the UK as possible."
1,Confusing Page Eight,"Difficult to follow the storyline. I found it confusing. The movie came highly recommended, but I would not recommend it to others."
2,Page eight,Really a fan of most Brit shows. Did not like this one. Too dark for me. Acting was fine just not my personal taste.
2,"Pretentious, Patronizing, Lame","Movie takes on airs of classic spy films but completely fails to deliver. It amounts to just a liberal tripe-fest aimed at the uninformed and simple-minded. Attempts at humor in the film are lame. Writers decided to tell, rather than show. You can sense this was aimed at an unsophisticated audience.I'd recommend any of the following over this one:- Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy- Funeral in Berlin- Dancer Upstairs- Fourth Protocol"
1,"boring, boring, boring","boring, boring, boring, with no redemption at the enddid I say it was boring?I kept waiting for something interesting, I waited in vain."
2,Weak Story Plot and Acting,"I rented the movie because it had a 5 Star rating initially. I've learned my lesson! I'm a fan of both lead actors but this film was 99% DIALOGUE...and dry at that. It has as much intrigue as a ""soft package"" gift under a christmas tree."
1,Page Eight not great,I was stunned by the blatant anti-Israel/anti-America writing that dominated this movie. Perhaps vilifying both was the main interest behind its production.
1,Of course this was for PBS - liberal and soooo dull!,"PBS must have jumped for joy when they saw this british film. Evil Americans - evil Israelis - the liberals paradise.I could probably have coped with the cliche liberal agenda - but had to turn it off after 45 mins as it was sooooo boring.............sooooo slow and terribly dull.There are much better anti-American/Israel films to feed those so inclined, give this a miss regardless of which side you support.BORING!"
4,Good,"I wouldn't say that this film is the greatest film of all time, however it was very enjoyable. It was entertaining and witty. The acting was very good. The script was sparse at times but overall was well done."
4,Held my attention.,"Good movie. Would highly recommend. 2 thumbs up! Considering buying the DVD. The Brits have a good one here. Watch, you won't regret it."
3,"Excellent cast, confusing story","There is an overall lack of depth in telling this story that leaves a lot of talent wasted. No character is ever completely realized and one is hard pressed to fill ""at home"" or empathy for any one of them. The lack of established connection between the two main characters makes any kind of relationship seem ridiculous, especially given her interests and his age. There is discussion, there is running about, there are meals but what connects these all together? Two documents of dubious intelligence value that could hurt the PM's reputation? It hardly seems like enough to worry about much less make an entire film for."
2,MI-5 its not,"Love BBC/Masterpiece Theater shows and ""MI-5""('Spooks' in the UK)in particular which is why I got this, and with the great cast you figure this contemporary political thriller couldn't miss, but it just didn't 'wow' me. Its so smart and 'dry' that it forgets to add some tension & ""hey its a spy movie"" has almost no action. The film looks great and the actors are in fine form but I kept waiting for some big thing to happen and it never did. The DVD has no special features but it does have subtitles which this hard of hearing American appreciates."
1,"Very Boring, poorly developed plot and contrary to many other's opinions--no suspense","I watched the entire show, hoping against hope that it would improve as the story unfolded. but it bored the heck out of me for the entire show. I knew something might be askew with the show when Michael Gambon exits early on. Also, Bill Nighy is asked to play a manniquin type character with utter and complete flatness for the entire show. I disagree totally with the positive reviews. The writing is dull and the director (also the writer) fails to narrate a rather simple story. Finally Ralph Fiennes looks like a gangster and perhaps it is not his fault--he plays the role written for him--but he simply has no credibility as a prime minister, even the worst of them. I was looking forward to this show, but was fatally disappointed."
3,Good First Manual,"This was a good first manual for my Sony Vaio when I first purchased it. While it didnt include my model it gave some great tips and learnings. What I did like about it was it was thorough, detailed and included pictures with descriptions."
2,Lacks details and takes a long time to basically explain why to delegate,"The overall message of the book - delegate decision making authority down into your team but provide them with overall direction - is a great message I totally agree with. However, the way in which it was presented left it somewhat unactionable as most of the content focuses on desired results and expected emotional responses rather than on details of how to make an effective transition to this organizational style. The book is strewn with examples from companies that have ""made the change"" and talks about how they improved profitability, morale, and retention. Those stories unfortunately focus on the results and not on what specific changes were made or how those changes were rolled out into the teams. This book felt more like a sales pitch for his consulting company than a book on how to lead this sort of change yourself."
3,Graduate class,Got this book for class and it was interesting. I don't know how practical the suggestions were but it had some good advice on how to run a team efficiently.
2,Variety readers beware!,"letter to Mr. Bart:Is Hollywood that boring that you have to collect old essays to tell us Who Killed Hollywood? Your laziness is exactly what you criticize people in Hollywood for, doing things for the sake of a profit. I was exepecting a new book with your views of what's going on in Hollywood not old essays from Variety and the dreaded GQ. Shame! Shame!"
2,It takes chutzpah,"It takes chutzpah, or arrogance, or an attitude of ""maybe there's a buck in it"" to put out a book such as this which is a collection of columns written by self opinionated Mr Bart for GQ and Variety. On the other hand it may be just another sign of the ""dumbing down of the West"" . I'm one of the dumb ones who bought it and in HARDCOVER (albeit remaindered). Not particularly well written but cashing in on the fact that he mixes with the rich and famous so suckers like me will fork out good money to find out his ""insights"" into the way Hollywood works. Save your money. Can be read IN TOTAL in about 30 minutes."
4,Just what I wanted,I want everyone to know that this product is great! I had one a number of years ago but it melted from constant use and I have been searching for another one for about the last six months. I contacted the maker of my hair dryer who put me in contact with another company which finally led me to this site and I couldn't be happier. Now I can style my hair the way that I want to!!
1,junk,Tore after 3 uses. It really is worth about a penny. Wish I had spent a bit more to get something of quality. The concept is great.
2,Hair dryer mitten,This thing works a little and it should have cost a dollar. Wasn't worth the expense. I had one in the past and it was 100% better.
1,Very poor poems that mis-represent Christianity,"This was one of the worst books I had the misfortune to read. It contained many typos and the standard of grammar was typical of that expected from a primary school pupil.The messages contained within this collection of poems portray Christianity as a violent and uncompromising religion, which is clearly inaccurate and offensive to those of the Christian faith. Many of the messages conveyed by these poems suggest that Christianity is incompatible with democracy. I for one consider this to be fallacious as Christianity has survived and indeed flourished in many democratic nations i.e. the United States, where many Christian organisations are free to spread the message of god without interference from the government etc.I believe that this collection of poems is best avoided as there are many good alternatives, which give a much more balanced view of the Christian faith without the typos and schoolboy grammatical errors."
1,Very boring,"After reading a couple of Kim's poems I became so board that I almost fell asleep. The poetry was so dull and failed to inspire me at all.Kim seemed rather confused at times as the idea he tries to put across changes mid-way through the poem. I found a few of the poems didn't make sense; perhaps Kim had just learned English so he found it difficult to translate them from his native language. Kim presents a rather extreme Evangelical view of the Christian faith as mainstream; some Christians may find this offensive. Kim seems to promote violence and intolerance in these poems, which I feel is not in keeping with the Christian ideology.As a first attempt at writing poetry in a second language, this wasn't a bad attempt. The reason why I give the book such a low mark is that the author claims he studied for degrees in America and Israel. If this is true, his English should be flawless and this collection of poems would represent a very poor attempt at writing literature."
5,Very happy,"This pan is as described. Little ridges on the bottom caused some worry for me at first, thinking sauces would stick and accumulate in them but this pan has proven itself 3 times in the last 3 weeks. I had to get a different lid (the kind that fits any pan) to get a good seal as the locking lid has holes in it that cannot be closed. I would like to see that added but definately not needed for straining pasta.I had hoped that getting a bigger pan would make it easier to cook my large meals but I seem to have ended up increasing the size of my meals to accomodate the larger size (smile). That's okay as I love leftovers."
3,"Good pot, but no way to close pouring holes","I really like this pot, but I was surprised that there is no way to close the pouring holes in the lid. The holes are no problem if you need to boil something partially covered (like potatoes or pasta). But you can't use it for steaming vegetables unless you put something over the holes (like aluminum foil). I probably wouldn't buy it again, but it's not that a big deal just covering them when I need to."
4,Great Pot,I have used the pot to boil some shrimp & potatoes & it worked great! I love the cool integrated strainer top. I imagine I will use it for pasta soon. Washes brillantly. Easy.
4,Jumping for Health: A Guide to Rebounding Aerobics,"I have to disagree with the one review listed here. I found the book to be quite informative. It discusses the phyisiological benefits of jumping -- including muscle toning, better posture, lymphatic cleansing, stress reduction, anti-aging, increased balance and coordination, improvements in vision -- and more. I have no idea how sound the medical information is in the book, and actually, I'm not reading it for that content. Intuitively, I sense the it's got to be healthy no matter what the medical details are. There are a total of 33 illustrated exercises graded from basic to advanced. I'm 51 and I'm doing the exercises in the book. My muscles are toning nicely and there's no doubt in my mind that my posture is improving and I'm healthier all around. The book is a pretty good guide in getting started gently. The advanced exercises are a real workout. I recommend the book!"
2,Clinging to the past,"Diner was a good movie. Avalon was a great movie. Tin Men was a very funny movie. Liberty Heights was a bit repetitive after Diner and Avalon, but good.Sixty-six is purely retread of already covered ground. We know Levinon grew up in Baltimore and we know he feels a very strong connection with it. But Levinson waxes so nostalgic about the power of Baltimore and the diner, that it bleeds into overkill.If you've never seen his movies, this book may appeal to you. But for those of you picking up this book because of his movies, he already put most of this book into his movies and this attempt at pulling a Forrest Gump here and having the turbulence of the 60s unfold around these diner folk seems added on.Character development here is in the form of dialogue and repetition of phrases here is grating.Mr. Levinson, we understand, you enjoyed your time growing up in Baltimore. Great, we're happy for you. Got anything else?"
2,Novel or Memoir?,"When I discovered this book in the library I was very excited. After all, I love Levinson movies, and Baltimore was my second home. I visited my father in Baltimore from my mother's home in NYC once a month for about 18 years. Of course, I came of age about half-a-generation after these characters.Unfortunately, the book reads not like a novel, but like a memoir. As Neil quotes Twain in the book (and I paraphrase) ""the difference between truth and fiction is that fiction has to be logical"". Well this fiction is too logical, too crafted, too contrived. I guess I don't believe that, in a true novel, these characters would have all these unspectacular and predictable misadventures.Some of this reaction stems, I'm sure from knowing Levinson's background and having seen his movies.I look for spontanaiety in a book. This book has no surprises.I give it 2 stars for the Baltimore nostalgia, but overall it is a disappointing read."
3,"Little ""bit"" late","The item I requested was no longer offered by Amazon, but another company did offer it, and I was satisfied, thanks."
4,I bought both and am glad I did,"Lin and Larry might not have made a big budget production, but they pass on a lot of info here. I bought this and Get rEady to cross oceans. Enjoyed the sailing scenes that illustrate the ideas. Wish I knew more about where some of the scenes came from. But that is not what the DVD is about - its about outfitting ideas and there are plenty here. I particularly like the storage ideas. Second DVD had more about actually being at sea - this one is sort of the starter, Cross Oceans carries on.Loved the pics of their 110 year old race boat in New Zealand. These folks are trying to keep sailing even though they must be in their 60's. A real inspiration."
3,Good but rehashed,"I have read and viewed several of the Pardey books/videos. I very much like their style and substance. However, I am getting a little tired of seeing many of the ideas/thought resurfacing in book after book, and now in videos. While this DVD is a good watch on a winter evening when the boat is on the hard, I will not buy any more of their books/videos."
1,tiny toy-like dome,"might work better in some other environments - over-priced for size, not recommended. ""Imitation"" is a good description... I should have given more attention to that..."
2,Littmann cardiology replica,"The acoustic quality is ok, but the rubber seal for bell and the earpieces comes off easy. The earpieces are very annouying.When I bought this item I got fooled by the term""free littmann tag"", I thought Iwas buying a genuin Littmann at a bagain price.This stethoscope is made in china.Not recommended.Bashar"
2,Not A Littman,"Although it is a decent stepthescope, I bought it thinking it was a Littman and it is not."
2,Not what i expected,The stethoscope pictured is a littman what i received was not. Only the name tag said littman. The advertisement is deceptive.
3,Horse-Hocky,"This is actually a good stethoscope for the money, and I would recommend it for EMS and GP use.However, THIS IS NOT A CARDIOLOGY STETHOSCOPE!When you receive your stethoscope it is obviously made by an EMS focused manufacture. The whole sales setup is designed so you can get a good stethoscope and make it look like a Littmann Cardiology III unit, which it is not.Also, watch the rubber parts. They tend to fall off easily. Once you know this you can glue them on.The unit itself is actually pretty good, & I like using it. I have recommended it to other Paramedics, as it works well in EMS & ambulance settings, without the fear of losing or breaking a hundred dollar plus tool. Once I glued my parts on, it has even survived being in my cargo pocket under my bunker pants inside of a fire.While I don't need the ""Littmann"" name tag to make me feel better, I do like that it has my name on it in an obvious place."
2,Bad!,"First at all, it is not Littman, is another brand made in China. The item is so heavy and the rubber seal for bell and the earpieces comes off easy. I do not recommend this item. It is much better pay more and get a genuine littman."
1,This stethoscope is AWFUL,"BUYER BEWARE! This stethoscope is NOT a Littman, despite how it may be advertised. It has decent acoustics, however it is CONSIDERABLY heavier than a Littman, and does not even come close to the Littman quality of sound. The earpieces also come loose in about 2 seconds, and you have to tweak the stethoscope as you listen to get a good seal. Forget about talking to the buyer about it if you are dissatisfied, they will only tell you what a great buy it is for $22. It's only a great buy if it's a great stethoscope, and this one is NOT! I have actually filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau about this item.... so if you are interested in a cheap knock-off which advertises itself as the real thing with only partly decent sound and cheap pieces, this is the item for you! If not, then get a real Littman and forget about this piece of garbage."
2,Buyer Beware,"This is a made in China copy of the original Littmann Cardiology I stethoscope. The original Littmann Cardiology I stethoscope was acoustically superb, but suffered from having too short of a tube. This stethoscope looks like the Cardiology I but with a longer tube. Unfortunately the comparison ends there. This stethoscope appears to be identical to the Allheart Cardiology stethoscope which was independently reviewed at [...]This review evaluated a dozen different stethoscopes, including ones which were top sellers at Amazon. Some samples of this stethoscope come with incorrect screw threads on the earpieces, which is why some of the other reviewers complain about the earpieces falling off. Acoustically it is decent if you replace the earieces with ones that fit properly."
1,I should have listened to the other reviews,This item falls apart on you. I had this stethoscope for 2 weeks and the earpieces have already fallen off along with the diaphragm. It worked while it lasted. But I should have just bought a Litmann.
1,Awful!,"There literally must be a defect in this stethoscope all heart sent me. I sent customer service a letter describing the faint, almost inaudible heart sounds - and they stated that they would not be able to allow a return or a replacement! What a lemon, please, don't waste your money. I'm never going to order from allheart again."
1,not a littman,"Don't be fooled, this is not a Littman. The diaphram fell off one week after I recieved it. The earpiece also fell off. It is not worth 5$. It is terrible."
2,"It's OK, but NEVER Littmann good!!!","This advertisement is written to confuse the buyer into getting this Everdixie stethoscope. I'm a fourth year medical student and I have to say this product is not actually bad, it allows a quite clear auscultation, but it is not littmann quality, as the promotion intends to imply.The company should show the product as it really is... an everdixie!"
2,"Less nice than on pic, 4W max","The plastic of the shade does not look attractive, and there is no possibility to put a brighter c7 bulb in it."
3,functional,"solid, unspectacular product, does what it is supposed to do which is provide a little light for my 3 yr old at night"
4,Night light,This is a simple night light that allows enough light to show you where you are stepping at night. Nothing fancy but it gets the job done. Recommend it.
4,Perfect nightlight,"Not too dim, not too bright. Perfect night light to switch on to change my baby's diaper in middle of the night without waking my husband. I don't leave it on all night so I don't know if it will get really hot. The plastic shade on the light is pretty thin...may melt if light is on all night...maybe."
5,Not what I expected: better,"I expect books by philosophers to be made up of closely reasoned logical arguments, not poetic descriptions of deeply felt personal encounters with nature. I find I much prefer the latter! Not that there isn't some philosophizing going on, but the power of the arguments derive from the poetry and the emotions. This is incandescent writing, and I wanted to share practically every paragraph with my friends - and in fact there will be several Christmas stockings stuffed with this little book this year. My only disappointment is that, although she makes a case for an emotional connection to place being as important as our attachment to family, she doesn't seem to come up with a prescription for making that connection more universal in our sadly disconnected world. Unless it's simply sharing our love of nature directly with as many people as possible. I suppose that's a start."
4,Cute action film,"Despite the corny, unrealistic action moves (especially the beginning) it was really enjoyable to watch this cops and robbers chase from India into Brazil. The love story was irresistible as well, with a believable performance by both Aishwarya and Hrithik."
5,Way Out West,"This album is awesome ... one of, if not the, best I've ever heard. Trust me, you need this album in your collection ... every track a gem."
1,chris and herb come up short...,"I have mixed feelings about this album. In all fairness, it isn't a bad effort. It's just that when I pay money for recorded music I hope that it will possess two qualities: innovation and enthusiasm. This album missed the mark in both respects. Chris has an average singing voice that doesn't offend the ears and Herb hits some good high notes. What disappointed me most was Hillman's mandolin playing. He has an odd style of picking that someone taught him about forty years ago and he has never progressed with it. This album has some really good musicians. Too bad one of them didn't take over the mandolin chores."
4,CD is a big help for learning the music.,"This instruction book includes a very helpful CD for listening in normal and slowed speed. You can play it on your computer or cd player plugged into your amp and practice. The song selection is a really good mixture of Yngwie's best songs. The book does not include tablature for the complete songs, but this is fine if you just want to study and play the ""signature"" solos and don't want to play the whole song (which is too difficult for beginners). There are no in-depth written instructions within the book so you should be familiar with understanding how to play and read tablature format. However, it is easy to learn! The only information that I wish it had is how to get the ""Yngwie"" sound through equipment and settings."
1,Glyphosate is NOT natural,"Whatever person wrote up the title for this product was misinformed or was aiming to mislead people. Remuda, with the same active ingredient as Roundup, is NOT a natural or organic product.If you're looking for an organic weed spray, try Burnout, Weed Pharm, or Nature's Avenger. Remuda's more of the same chemical herbicide we've all been trying to get away from."
2,The Complete Rhodesian Ridgeback,"Very good book if you are geared toward showing your dog. Or if you were really interested in the the lineage of the breed in three countries. For the novice recipient of such an awesomedog, I found it completely lacking in real world advice, save for one chapter. I guess I should have bought "" ridgebacks for dummies"" because this book mostly went over my head. The content was well written, though. The Authors know the breed."
3,"a basic book on the breed, very little puppy training listed",I wish I had ordered a book on training rather than an abridged history on the breed itself. The author should have devoted a chapter to raising and training your new puppy from a first-time owner's point of view.
1,Very limited overview of the breed,Not the best choice for someone researching the breed or living with their first ridgeback. The entire text needs expansion and updating; sections on training and health matters were completely lacking in any meaningful content.
2,Out of Date,"As the owner of two Ridgebacks, I read this book awhile ago. I reread it recently and there are many out of date subjects. It explains that puppies born with Dermoids or Ridgeless should be put to sleep. I bought a puppy to discover that he had 3 large Dermoids. Many vets do this operation now. Dermoids surgery is anywhere from $150-500. What is the matter with a Ridgeless puppy? Nothing. At least find a good home for the puppy. Many people dont mind a ridgeless. Out dated vaccination info. I recommend Natural Health for Dogs and Cats by DR Pitcairn."
4,Excellent classic kung-fu Gordon Liu film,"Excellent classic kung fu film starring Gordon (Master Killer) Liu in which he also directed. Very memorable and entertaining opening sequence with shaolin monks vs. wutang warrior. Includes a shaolin training sequence in the same style as ""Shaolin Master Killer."" Also has a similar ""exhibition"" fight with his teacher (the SAME exhibition teacher as in ""Master Killer""). Great fighting to be had by all! One of Gordon Liu's better films. Starts out slow, ends like a firecracker."
4,Top five Shaw brother Kung Fu bloodbath,"You may not wanna watch this one with your little brother. Sooo many people die in this movie it's insane. Cool story, plenty of action, original Venoms, need I say more? Sholin gets revenge on Wu Tang, Wu Tang strikes back, back and forth until Wu Tang viscously crosses the line. You have got to see it."
1,wasting the money,"Well, price tells all. It does looks a great price since the pack has so many batteries in. But, they do not last. I was using these for my wireless mouse. And I was changing batteries like every a couple of days. They do not last at all. Just buy ""regular"" batteries. They cost more but they do last A LOT longer than these."
1,Fatally flawed,"Motorola PEBL U6 Pumpkin Orange Phone (Unlocked Intl. Version) no U.S. WarrantyThe phone is fatally flawed. Fully charged it could only make two calls before it warned of low battery and then stopped working. This happened every day, no matter how long it had been charged for.While it is possible I got a phone with a defective battery, I would avoid this phone given other complaints of short battery life (see Amazon reviews of this phone in other colors)."
1,"Not a pumpkin, but a lemon!","This item was not at all like it was described. I do not buy anything refurbished unless it is guaranteed ""like new"". This telephone looked like it really had been through the ringer. Furthermore it came with a little xeroxed pamphlet that left out a whole bunch of applications that the cell has, so I have to trial and error a lot of stuff. I would say rather than buy a used cell, pay the extra $50.00 and get a brand new one. Lastly, there is no way to insert a security lock on phone and previous owners ""films"" are still on the phone and I can't erase them."
5,Incredible...,"There is just something magical about this comic. It is the story of a devil who wants a different life. He's been everywhere and done everything, and realized that he's forgotten who he really is. He befriends a young girl, who puts him on the right path at last. There is a bit of myth thrown in, and the result is surprisingly (and refreshingly) original.It takes a lot for me to find something truely heartwarming, and this book is almost overwhelmingly so at times. It is definitely not sappy, but it has a real innocence. It is also a well-timed comic, and simply wothy of my best all-around praise.I can't wait for the next collection... I can't wait to see what becomes of Shuck and Thursday... They've become two of my favorite fictional characters."
4,"GREAT RIG, WEAK COVER","We are very happy with the Gig Rig. However, the cover does not fit well and because of that it does not secure."
2,Too much cream no moisture,I found this cream to be just OKAYfor a fair price.It did not feelas moist as I would like for myskin anywhere on my body
3,Mixed Feelings For Patriot Hearts,"Barbara Hambly is clearly a talented writer and writes well researched fiction. The stories in this book are compelling and interesting but the book is extremely hard to read. I normally finish a book in three days... this book took me three weeks to read and I almost gave up on it before finishing. Why? The viewpoint shifts from chapter to chapter to different women (many of whom share the same name). There is more than one Abigail, Nabby, Mary, etc. No warning is given when the viewpoint changes and the shift is often confusing and misleading. I had to read several chapters more than once and still couldn't figure out whose story I was reading! The subject matter is wonderful and the historical details are fascinating but the effort required to read the book may be too much for some people."
3,Very Disappointing,"Where I found the content of the book interesting, it was presented in such a broken up way to be very confusing at times. I had a hard time figuring out where I was at the time and remembering where I had left off with this character the last time she was talked about. I found myself very frustrated and wound up skimming to finish the book just in case something interesting would come in, that I wouldn't want to miss. But on the whole, the book was very disappointing."
5,Historical Fiction,"This is a very enjoyable book, and Barbara Hambly is a very good author.While reading this book, I had to compare the first fifty years of our Country with the current times. There are a lot of similarities."
2,"Nerds, spiders, and noir setting! Oh My!","I'm a fan of B-style movies. So when I heard of the new Creature Feature series, I thought this series would be fun! Well, I found ""Earth Versus the Spider"" to be merely average, with occasional touches of greatness.When nerdy security guard Quentin's partner is killed by thugs, Quentin takes matters into his own hands by injecting himself with a mysterious 'spider' juice, which temporarily gives him really cool powers. Unfortunately, the side affects are monstrous- quite literally, thus begins a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" story for the modern age.Pro's: I liked the film 'noir' setting. The cool costumes, and the acting.Cons: I just didn't like the Quentin character. Perhaps if he'd been a more likeable guy, I would've felt sorry for him. As it was, he was just a little too weird and a little too nerdy for me to care what happened to him. Plus, despite the comic book interest he wasn't nerdy enough.I much prefer ""She Creature"" another title in this series.."
4,Spiderman Gone Bad,"I ordered this DVD thinking it was either an enhanced version of the 1950's black and white sci-fi flick ""Earth vs. the Spider"" or a remake of that same classic. It was neither. In tune with the relase of the box-office smash ""Spider-man"" this two year earlier horror film has a plot completely contrary to the comic book character. This human turned spider is a bad guy...and instead of having normal hands and legs that give him the ability to climb walls, he grows EIGHT new limbs. It, too, has a love interest storyline. Dan Akroyd is the detective. This is a great film to see AFTER ""Spider-man"". I would, however, love to see the original 50's classic of ""Earth vs. the Spider"" on DVD."
2,earth vs the spider,this is one of those films you wait the whole way through and just at the end it climaxes and if you turn away you miss it. I feel the story could have had more if the spiders had escaped once out they grew and hunting man for their prey instead of the direction the film took much like tarantula who was gigantic the picture and audio quality were both excellent too bad the story line lets this film down badly myself i am disappointed in this film i hope this helps other people wayne shepherd
5,Jessie's Bullet,"Can't stop playing this song. Sending it to all my kids and relatives. It is eclectic, unorthodox, non-standard. So the 1st time you hear it, you may be confused; trying to figure out what you are listening to. After the third time, it will be in your soul. It is a long song and it ""travels""; by which I mean it changes, evolves, comes at you from different directions, changes pace/touch. But it is an awesome sound. I only bought this song, but am going back to retry others on the album. I consider this one of my ""jewels"". So, so glad I bought it."
4,Cooley writes of an archivist of life as well as books,"I came upon this book by chance and was thrilled to find a book written in many layers, giving food for thought beyond the obvious story line. I agreed with the reader from Leipire Fork, TN but also felt that Matthew was not stoic but standing at the sidelines of life, even his own; archiving interactions more than participating in them.This book is for the reader that loves words, subtlety and the invitation to think past his own space and time. The current zeitgeist demands we look at the aftermath of WWII not insofar as economy or political structure but in regard to psychological impact, guilt, and emotion. ""The Archivist"" certainly accomplishes this purpose.From reviews I've read, ""The Reader"" deals with the same subject from a completely different perspective. Unfortunately I haven't read ""The Reader"" as yet and cannot make a comparison."
2,disappointing and un-subtle,"I approached this book with high hopes, as all the reviews have seemed to indicate that the book would be fascinating. The themes and the narrative focus are good ones, and the bare bones of the story could make for a wonderful novel. But this ain't it. Cooley will learn, one hopes, that it's not such a great idea to have characters launch into soliloquies of self explanation, over and over, as a way to advance the story. It's surprisingly unpolished, for all its good intentions, and my disappointment is as much with all the un-critical critics as it is with Cooley."
4,Thanks Martha Cooley-- a great read!,"It has been ages since a novel has captivated me as this book has done.It is beautifully crafted and filled with interesting moments. It has a great balance to it, and a tenderness in the midst of isolation and the characters' struggles between connection and disengagement, love and fear.I have devoured Martha Cooley's lovely book and I can't wait for her next one!"
3,a book for bookworms,"The Archivist, though a well written novel, was difficult for me to read. I forced myself to finish it on recommendation from another avid reader. The voice of the novel improved when Judith, the archivist's mentally ill wife, is heard through her journal. I found Judith's journal to be very clinical and more schizophrenic than manic depressive. Though low key, the book does have its own element of suspense and a bit of surprise at the end. This would be a great read for one who is a fan of TS Eliot and loves poetry in general. A good read for someone who majored in English! The setting of the book was difficult for me to identify with...two insulated, academic couples with mentally unstable wives."
4,incisive dialogue,"The strenght of this novel is its true-to-life dialogue. If you like to suck on the marrow of insight, you will enjoy this book."
1,very disappointing,"Reading the jacket description of this book, I thought it sounded interesting. But I ended up hating this book and was barely able to finish it. This book tries to cover too many things, including the Holocaust, the life of a weird librarian, his ""relationship"" with a student, and his crazy wife who is now deceased. Everyone in the book is obsessed with the poet T.S. Eliot and snippets of his poems are scattered throughout the book at random and awkward moments which ultimately detract from the story instead of enhancing it. Cooley has an abstract philosophical way of writing which I found extremely annoying. The characters are too involved in their own selfish worlds and were completely uninteresting. Terrible book."
2,The Archivist,"Martha Cooley's first novel is definitely accomplished, but I found the middle third of the book to be quite arduous. While it had at first seemed wonderful that the characters were T.S. Eliot fans, it soon became annoyingly pretentious when they quoted Eliot to refer to events or emotions in their lives. Particularly harrowing was the middle third of the book which is a seemingly endless series of journal entries from a manic depressive? woman who quotes Eliot without cease and obsesses over the holocaust and her lost heritage. This section could definitely have been re-worked. The central ""mystery"" of the novel, if it can be called that, is very unengaging and I felt utterly deflated by the end. I resold the book the first chance I got. The concepts were interesting, as was the smooth prose style--but the parallels being drawn between the lives of the characters and that of T.S. Eliot were strained and the ""madness"" passages were overwrought and finally, tedious."
4,Debut novel that lingers with you long after its finish,"This literary tale of betrayal works on many different levels; it is an historical novel, a romance novel and a tale of dealing with madness. Each sentence evokes a feeling and mood that leads the reading alone an interesting journey with characters who stay with you long after you have finished the magnificient piece. The plotting is unique and I agree with some of the other reviewers that the middle is the weakest part. However, the surprise ending more than makes up for any perceived deficiency. This finely woven tale covers the gamut of many emotions of the protagonist and brings the reader gently along on this journey. I was amazed to be snagged into the world of libraries and archives and to finally have to indeed consider that these stodgy institutions are indeed places of intrique."
1,"Move Along, Nothing to See Here","Bad, bad, bad. Well-written perhaps, but just plain bad otherwise. I cared nothing for the main character, even less for the supposedly-alluring woman he gets ""involved"" with, and was infuriated by the story line and the so-called resolution. But then, as an archivist, I guess I would be. If you like your near-romances stifling and unmoving, then indulge yourself. Otherwise, skip it."
3,This album will get you into grooves..and move!,"Original 1976 released and this albums have hits and miss.""Waiting for the Man"" has great beats and tunes but it is the same old formula of Nazareth's hard rock.""I Don't Want to go on without You"" is the slow rock ballad in the formula of ""LOVE HURTS"". If not for the harmonies, this song is passable.Songs which really worth credits are ""FLYING"" and ""Down Home Girl"", the first one being the sweet ballad and haunting beautiful tunes and the latter being the decent rock song."
4,Great!,"It looks really great. The only problem with this figure is the sword's fragility. I got it attached to Vaan's hand at one point, but it snapped at the hilt the next time I touched it. VERY FRAGILE, BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE SWORD! Other than that, this is a great figure for fans of Final Fantasy XII or collectors of the PlayArts figures. I highly recommend it, but I'd suggest keeping Vaan empty handed if you don't have a gentle touch."
3,RAMY Cucumber Chamomile Face Scrub,"The ""beads"" in the scrub are not as fine as I would have liked and the product is a bit watery."
3,Decent sequel to Stardancer.,"I'd been a big fan of Stardancer/Starseed as a young teenager, so I was curious and picked the book up again now. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold up all that well over time. The plot is okay, and a lot of the book is well written.Where it falls down is the pacing (weirdly way too fast in some places) and some pretty serious plot inconsistencies. I got the feeling (fair or not) that the Robinsons wrote this book too quickly and without leaving themselves enough time to finish it properly.A dancer joins a foundation designed to help people become symbiotic stardancers, but becomes embroiled in a plot to destroy the stardancers entirely."
2,NOT VERY INTERESTING,IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD BOOK WITH A LOT MORE IMAGINATION PUT INTO IT.....IT'S JUST SO....BORING.
3,OK Sequel to Stardancer,"This sequel to Stardancer was pretty good and since I was in a stardance frame of mind, I enjoyed it. There was a little too much gratuitous sex and the murder mystery part could have happened earlier in the book. However, the concept of earthlings being jealous of another ""freer"" species rings very true, sociologically. And we all know that when the earthling ""boys"" get jealous, they try to DESTROY whatever they can't have. So it seemed pretty realistic (and I like sociological sci-fi.)."
5,"Classic, excellent","From back cover--""GOTHIC Romance. by New York Herald---An astonishingly well-sustained long tale is an exercise in the Gothic vein set in frightening insecurity on a small West Indian island. It begins with the three charming, heartless young Vails to whom murder would appear to be an entirely suitable means of assuring their comfort...Miss Root, in a novel of formidable proportion and effectiveness, evokes and sustains fear with delicate assurance, winding it through savage violence and sleekest urbanity but never for an instant letting it slacken...hair-raising..."""
4,I thought it was funny,It's not a high budget film. If you have high budget expectations you will be let down. I thought it was funny and I enjoyed it.
2,ok first run,FOR A TEST MOVIE IT WAS OK. I WOULD NOT PAY TO SEE AT THE THEATERS OR DVD RENTAL BUT SINCE IT WAS FREE I CAN NOT COMPLAIN.
4,Well Done,"It might not have been a high budget film, but it was very well done and well scripted. My gf thought it started out slow, but it got better. We thought it had a lot of funny parts in it. Well done Amazon. Continue the good work."
2,Boring,I never connected with the characters. The acting felt like acting. Production was good but the story lacked any real interest. Conversations seemed very unnatural and I just couldn't get into it. Sorry.
4,Not too shabby...,First movie I streamed on my Kindle Fire. Funny movie that I would watch again. Good soundtrack to go along with it. Good job Amazon Studios!!
4,"Clever, Current and Quirky","This film is very funny and couldn't have been written a few years ago. The cast is very talented, diverse and fresh. The plot is unpredictable and original. Lots of laughs. I especially enjoyed the actor who played the bad boyfriend, Gabe Reed. Full disclosure compells to say he is my son. I highly recommend this film."
5,awesome!,This movie was awesome! I'd definitely watch it in theaters! Story line was classic but with a modern twist. I'm sure with a little more comedy and action it will turn out great.
3,Clever and Cute :),Was not to bad and the plot kept you plugged in enough to keep watching. Sort of a well made B movie.
3,worth the wait for DVD/online,"Worth a watch here but in the theater @ $15/ticket....eh....worth the wait. One big change needed...get rid of the verbal ""LOL"" and ""TTYL""s, etc. Too corny and just not done past the age of 8 or so!"
2,"Great Acting, Poor on Content","The actors did an amazing job! I think there was strong acting however the story was not very strong. The flashback or fantasy scenes seemed out of place and didn't contribute anything to the story line. The whole ""gangsta rappa"" part was absolutely ridiculous. I was REALLY put off by that. Why not make the guy just rich, crazy, and possessive? Let him be a movie producer or something like that. It was very difficult to sit all the way through the movie. As it stands right now I would not pay to watch this movie or would be EXTREMELY pissed if I did. With some major revisions in the plot it could be much stronger."
2,Let down,"Lots of potential, wish it were cleaner. Start off well, then unnecessary scenes for higher rating I suppose. Rushed ending. Swear words and gay bar scenes do not make a movie better."
1,It just kept getting worse and worse...,"I gave it a shot; it started off okay, but just kept getting worse and more contrived and ridiculous. And not in a good way. There's no way I'd pay to see this in a theatre; I couldn't even watch the entire thing. Sorry guys."
3,"Fresh and funny, but needs heavy editing","I love the premise of this film: Four online friends meet up to go check on the online love interest of the main character. So much of this worked, and there were moments of laugh-out-loud humor. But many of the scenes just didn't work or were way too long. The movie didn't hold my interest enough to watch it all in one sitting. But I pressed on because I did like the concept. The end was a little formulaic, but, overall, I enjoyed the movie. Made me want to make more Facebook friends to hook up with some quirky weirdos!It's not a great film, and it needs a lot of work to be a ""real"" movie, but it was worth watching."
4,Loved it!,"This movie was better than many that I have paid 10 X for in the theatre! Clever dialogue, great storyline, and nice soundtrack."
3,it was okay,"I just wish you guys would work on movies that are not so ""hollywood."" looking at the amazon studios page, it seems like you want this movie to be even more formulaic, since you were asking that it be more like ""nick and norah."" I guess that's where the box office money is. But look at indie movies like Clerks too. Fresh movies like that can make a lot of money too if they become cult classics. I don't think the subject matter is important at all, I'm just tired of predictable movies."
3,Keep Making These,"I was curious about the Amazon Studios work, so I watched this. Sure it could use some polishing, but will that come with time. The story was funny, that acting wasn't bad, and I was entertained, which is the whole point isn't it?Keep making these Amazon Studios, you're onto something, and we're watching."
4,"Concept is there, needs some refinement","The only character I felt was fully developed was Pants. All the other characters didn't seem like they had a common trend on how they spoke or the reasons why they would say the things they said. I think that if it were edited in a way that mimicked ""Scott Pilgrim"" and got Zach Galafanakis to play pants then this movie could definitely sell."
2,Reminds me of a bad Harold and Kumar movie,"This movie tries to be like a Harold and Kumar movie, but doesn't quite get there. The story is pretty bad and the movie just isn't funny. I would not recommend this movie be made into a full production. Actually, I wouldn't recommend that anyone watch this version either."
2,Hmm . . . Is this is a Movie?,"I get the rough draft thing, but where the is the story? All it is is some lame Facebook Conversations. Honestly it feels more like a commercial for Facebook over an actual story with real people. Of course, they could be planning to add that in but there is nothing to indicate that. Maybe they were going for a ""You Got Mail"" story for Facebook - I don't know - but it needs A LOT of work!"
4,Funny and creative. Loved it. (not offensive),"I thought the movie was funny and pretty awesome for a real low budget film. The actors were pretty much all funny. Some were better than others, but over all much better than I expected. For the two reviews who thought it was offensive to blacks and blind people, I'm thinking get over it. Every comedy of this nature is going to offend somebody if the person is easily offended. Just release this movie right now how it is... It's funny, ha"
2,HS & college kids might like it ?,"Personally I did NOT care for this movie, and would not recommend it to anyone. However. I truly hated ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and that did well with the younger crowd so maybe you have something here."
5,pretty funny,The thing that I'd change is the cheezy car explosion. Otherwise I see no reason why I wouldn't go see it in theaters.
3,Fair,"This is one of those ideas that I don't think would work as a high-budget movie. In some ways I think it might be best as-is. The acting is fair and the plot is decent. I've seen a lot of movies with similar story-lines and bigger budgets that aren't done even as well as this is, so I think that's a good accomplishment. It's a good way to waste a couple hours, it's entertaining and has some good lines, but I just don't think it would work. I mean if you polished it up a little bit but kept it pretty much the same I think that's all that you could do to really improve it. Fix the CGI explosion of the car, maybe add some more funny lines, the whole part with ""the library"" was a little strange for me. Just seemed kind of out of place. Over-all I thought it was good though, I just don't know if many people can relate to the plot, I couldn't really, but maybe more people can, I don't know."
4,"Really fun, really now.","I watched this waiting for a delayed plane in LAX. Figured nothing could be worse than a 3 hour delay. Imagine my surprise. this movie is good!Interesting, well acted, full of fun twists, and and totally unexpected.thanks for helping me not go out of my mind!!and please, keep making movies!"
3,3 Stars for Non-Originality,"Basically, from what this movie showed me I would do some fine tuning before making it into a real big budget movie. The actors needed work, but on low budget what can you expect.Overall the story is solid, and just needs some work to make it a hit. Some of the lines were a bit odd at times, and the dialogue was lacking but overall a decent, fresh, movie."
1,waste of time,"hell no i think i'm going to shoot myself at the very least, barf....I hope this never makes it to theaters"
2,"Good Try, But not Worth the Buy","I watched a few parts of the video. It was a very neat idea but any video that is watchable needs a rating. Weather its beta or not. This video was a neat idea but I would not recommend it for children to watch it. It was neat how you added facebook actions as part of the movie but the actors in the video said a few things I am not sure young children should listen to. There it was a good video but yet again,.. it needs to have a rating or some kind of warning if any kind of content or adult words used in the video. Thank you for the effort though."
4,Diamond not so rough,"I went in with no expectations and really enjoyed the movie. I liked the ensemble cast, I loved Rishi & Pants and Mo Bu, I do know people like really that. I didnt mind the lower budget effects and I thought the story moved at a pretty decent pace. I would recommend to friends."
3,Makes me think of a Judd Apatow Geek/Stoner Movie?,"Okay storyline, but it would probably have to get rewritten several times before it would be ready for the actual big screen. A bit clunky overall, but I feel like other studios have released worse in the past."
4,"hmm...it was interesting, and cute","The idea was a good, the title...intriguing. I think it would have been better as a short film, there was a little too much dialogue, and I think that with a little more editing, it could have been shortened and improved."
4,Interesting Read,"This book is compiled from the found writings of a sergeant of the Seventh Cavalry who survived the Battle of the Little Big Horn. The first hand accounts of men like Sergeant Windolph and Theodore Goldin are very valuable and interesting reading. They were not men defending their performance as were the officers like Benteen, Reno, and Godfrey. They had their biases but didn't have to grind axes. This account is worthwhile reading for students of the Seventh Cavalry and the Little Big Horn campaign."
5,A memorable account of the Custer fight,"As a Custer buff, this book has been on my shelf for a long time. A great book to read, one that fleshes out a lot of the daily life in the Seventh as well as the battle along Greasy Grass. Right up there with ""Son of Morning Star"" and Walter Camp's book on the subject. Check 'em out, you won't be disappointed."
4,Good Read,This book offers an on-the-ground view of the campaign and battle from the perspective of a trooper and common man understood the bigger issues of the day with a lot more clarity than many academics of our own time and issues. I think veterans will appreciate Sgt. Windolph's description of enlisted life.
4,Another Catwoman?,"Chloe King is a girl with cat-like powers (sounds familiar???) that also includes having 9 lives. As part of an ancient European species called The Mai, she is now a target of an organization called The Order of the Tenth Blade, out to destroy the Mais. Good pacing, but the cat woman idea has already been played out. Not the best super power books for teens, but alright. For those who like super power teen books like Buffy, this is recommended along with Queen B Superheroine and Fearless."
2,shiping too slow and expensive,i bought this book and total cost is more than $15(including $5 shipping)which is not fair to my understanding.
2,Digging your way out of career nowhere...,"Not to be confused with the band ""Specimen."" Now that's a band!"
2,National Geogrpahic Photography Guide for Kids,"This was an expensive product which was not up to date with current digital technology. I was tempted by the title, but found that it was passé for the 11 year old who received it. One would have expected something better with a National Geographic title and Amazon should give the date of publication with books such as this."
1,"Big expectations, poor results","I bought this game for my 3 year old last Christmas and it was the worst gift ever. My son is an avid Spongebob fan and I thought he might enjoy this as a beginner board game but we have been sorely disappointed. The ""board"" is in fact a folded plastic sheet that never lies flat and so the character pieces are always falling over. Every time we pull this out my son loses interest within 5 minutes and asks for his candyland game instead. Save your money and your time, do not buy this toy."
4,Handy and Effective,"It won't cut larger logs but with smaller diameter items (softball sized or smaller) it works great. Ripped through a 4"" pine tree in a matter of seconds (less than a minute). It packs down small, is fairly light and works better than a machete or small hatchet for cutting trees or round logs. It's not a large axe or a chain saw but is an excellent item for smaller items. Only complaint would be the fabric connecting the handles to the blade. It would be a pain to replace and might not hold up over long term use."
3,Only OK,"I don't know why none of the other reviewers mention this flaw. The blade segments are nice in themselves, but only attached at one point in the middle and while using the saw the corners can slip past each other and get caught there. It still functions, but having two connections per segment like a regular chainsaw blade would be much better. I never even got to use mine because I lent it to a friend as soon as I got it and that one and my other friend's both did it repeatedly. They were able to get it back most of the time, but mine has gotten stuck in that flawed position. A good idea that needs a bot of redesign."
1,Garbage telescope,"There is a saying among amateur astronomers to stay away from ANY telescope that advertises magnification. This telescope is garbage, I was given one for Christmas several years ago and returned it. The optics are just terrible, the mount unstable and the 60 mm objective appeture will let you see the moon and not much else. For just a few dollars more, you can purchase a SkyQuest 4 - 1/2 inch dobsonian telescope from Orion that is dozens of times better. Meade does make some nice scopes, but these low end ones are only going to wind up in the junk. I would recommend that before anyone purchase a telescope they first read a book called Nightwatch by Terrence Dickenson, or do some research on the internet. There are many good websites...I have owned several telescopes including another one by Meade and the Saturn is one of the worst telescopes that I've looked through."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!,"I ordered this item 2 days ago, it arrived today intact, not scratched, in the original plastic wrap. Took 2 minutes to assemble- no tools required. I became concerned because it was barely balancing until I placed my Ladies Classic Schwinn on it (a heavy bike) - no wobble, no muss no fuss. No screws required as is next to the wall in the garage. Wish I had invented it!!"
2,Not Free Standing,"We had to buy hardware to attach this rack to the garage wall. It kept falling over with our 2 mountain bikes on it, even with just one bike on it in fact. If you have 2 extra light 10 speeds or children's bikes it may work freestanding, but not for most bikes."
3,"Holds up the bikes, but definitely mount it to the wall","We put this in our office area. It's a tight space, but this works well. Although it says it's freestanding you will definitely want to mount it on the wall at the top (it has instructions). Make sure you find a good stud for it!"
3,low price - good value,"Pro: Very fast and easy to assemble, no tools required. Stand it against a wall and I don't think it will be falling over even without using the enclosed anchor. Inexpensive and efficient. Perfect for use in a garage.Con: My bike has a crossbar that is ""sloped"" (not horizontal). The bike rack arms are slippery and my bike slides toward the rear when I put both arms under the crossbar. Without velcro, I don't see how I'd be able to mount my bike as pictured. Also, mine doesn't exactly assemble perfectly vertically, so I'd maybe suggest something nicer for someone thinking of installing it in an apartment. In the past I've had a floor-to-ceiling ""bike pole"" for 2 bikes that looked OK in a condo."
