4,party items,"one of the pieces came broken.Even that everything was packed very nice and in the box , the rotation disco light was broken.I don't know if i can send it back just broken piece or i have to send back entire set"
5,My Favorite of Favorites!,"I have a lot of books I've loved, but rare is the book that stands out above even the best. THE GAME is one of those books. This novel is fun and adventurous, evoking all kinds of emotions, and never gets boring. Real historical characters give it a sense of realism, along with the fiction's entertainment.Pirate Liam O'Neill is Master of the Seas, but once he sees Katherine, he intends to be master of her passion as well. She fights him, despite her body craving him, but Liam won't give up his pursuit. He intends to woo her, but he's not the only man after her. She is his, as far as he's concerned, and he'll fight any man who tries to take her from him.This is one book I won't forget, and it's wonderful to have read a book that stands out so far above the rest. Brenda Joyce is a true queen of romance."
4,Entertaining and Memorable Read,"Brenda Joyce always creates the most memorable characters and I always enjoy her books. The Game was no exception. When I first began reading I was not sure if I was going to be able to get into the story because I thought the heroine was going to be too unlikeable to me. I was thinking she didn't deserve the guy. She was trying my patience so I didn't understand how he could stand her. However, I kept reading and the story progressed nicely as did the heroine, and I came to understand her and like her more. The previous reviewer said she had to put put the book down because it was obvious what was going to happen. That's too bad because had she continued to read she would have seen what seemed apparent was not. It was a great book and worth the read."
3,"It's good, but not great...too lengthy in many parts.","This is a long read, stuffed with a great deal of fluff. The male did fall for the heroine much too quickly...so we can only assume it was due to physical attraction and not much to do with her disposition. Good authors will write all dimensions of main characters well, not just intense physical attraction. The heroine was annoying in several parts of the book and just not made of the substance you want strong women to be made of. Oh well, I did find the drama between the Queen and her subjects mildly amusing, so I suppose all was not lost. I don't know why I keep reading Brenda Joyce, she often seems to be lacking in one regard or another."
2,I tried to love this....,"As I have loved others by Brenda Joyce, but this one just didn't do it for me.I'll give one star for being historically ambitious and one star for setting and period detail.A promising start for me - a convent-raised heroine and a lusty pirate.But it soon fizzled. There were too many pages of - yes you will, no I won't, not ever! drama. Liam was a passionate pirate, he came on strong but tried ever so hard to prove he was not like his father. I was not convinced. Katherine was a spoiled child without any redeeming qualities.I know I can't expect characters to be other than true to their times, so in that respect they may be exactly perfect. However, quality characters transcend the times they live in. Beauty and gorgeous bodies without a head or a heart aren't enough.I did not like the characters, did not care if they ended up together. I skimmed the last hundred pages simply to get to that end."
2,Not Worth Buying,"After reading 'The Fires of Paradise' and 'The conqueror', I found this book not up to par. There is a lack of sexual tension and there is no chemistry between the hero and heroine. I should have heeded the warning of some of your readers and thus avoiding the disappointment. However, I will continue to read Ms Joyce books to find other keepers."
5,YOU MUST GET THIS BOOK!!!!!,"If only men like these existed in our world, and if they do, if only they came in droves. Liam is determined and succeeds in getting what he had set out to achieve...Katherine. But, our stubborn lady refuses to give in without a fight, and what a fight it was. This book is a real page turner. If you don't have it, I strongly recommend that you rush out to get a copy of your own."
2,I would get this one from the library,"Released from a French convent, Katherine FitzGerald sets sail for her home of Ireland, only to find herself a prisoner of the Pirate known as Master of the seas, Liam O'Neill. He is determined to win her and at the same time advance his secret causes.I know this has some really good reviews but I did not like this book, although it was written well in many respects.I liked Liam O'Neil (and the secret he held of Katherine while she was in the convent) but I did not like Katherine FitzGerald at all. I found her spoiled and too fast to take the easy way out of every situation. She was pathetic; I like heroines 'strong' in their love of their man, that know their own mind and second best is just not an option. I don't think she ever really knew what she wanted. And every male that looked at her, falling under her spell because of her beauty... gagged me."
4,Supportive and very breathable,"I bought these shoes a week ago and wasn't sure what they would be like since I had never seen them in person. I was not let down. The pictures do not do these shoes justice. They uppers are a woven mesh with a liner. These shoes are alomst as breathable as sandals! The soles are supportive, but felt kinda stiff at first and took a few days to get used to. They have pretty good sized lugs on the sole for grip in the dirt, but watch out if you step on a wet rock or pavement. Whatever the soles are made of doesn't provide much traction on wet surfaces. This could disappear in time though as the ""newness"" wears off the soles."
3,basically OK,"This is cult TV from a British perspective. It is a good overview of comedy programmes shown on UK TV including many US imports. It does exclude some US shows like ""Three's Company"" which weren't shown there but does have ""Man About the House"" which was the UK series from which it was copied, and hence adds a new perspective to some US shows. Good basic information on screening dates, writers, etc. There's a short description of each show, some photos - but it leaves you wanting more of both. The style is not conducive to cozying down to a nostalgia fest but worth having on the shelf as a reference."
2,Compression for clinicians,Basic information on compression would like more information of direction microphones and other options for hearing aids.
2,Listen - before you buy,This may be top of the piano music to your ears - but you should listen to parts of it on beforehand.Had I done so - and not only read the reviews - I never would have bought it.
2,Piece of TRASH,"The only feature I care about is that this KVM switch allows the use of USB keyboards and mice. However, you will find yourself in eternal frustration while using the keyboard because keystrokes frequently lost or stuck. Even as I'm typing this now, I've had to correct this stupid KVM switch because it doesn't pick up keystrokes sometimes. Perhaps I'm typing too fast (yeah right), I don't know. On top of that, keystrokes are frequently stuck too. You can be typing, and then all of a sudden you'll get a sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssslew of the same letter. Very very frustrating. I've hooked this switch up to different machines; I've swapped out keyboards and mice; I've even replaced the switch the same exact make and model! The problem definitely resides in these switches. Don't let the price tag fool you, YOU DON'T GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!"
5,A strong reference for digital film making process,"DV Filmmaking for Ian David Aronson gives you in 18 chapter a coverage for the production, post-production and distribution process of the digital film making.The book starts with basic digital Cinematography principles. It covers he process stages such as composing shoots, lighting, shooting, working with cameras, audio, still images and titles.This book doesn't give you a specific software tutorial, but if you are working learning with video production and video editing program, you should get a background about the whole film making process. However, this book gives you a strong background in this industry. I find this book useful for animators, multimedia designers and creative directors.The two appendixes in the end of the book gives you a tips about getting your work in various media and selling your products."
5,Fantastic book,"I am a novice filmmaker doing training and educational videos and have been reading several magazines for about a year or so, slowly expanding my skills and knowledge base. Ian Aronson's book DV Filmmaking was perfect for presenting the wide range of essential topics in an easy to read and understandable whole. The book really is start to finish. I particularely liked Ian's inclusion of source materials to experiment on with the techniques being taught. I have read several video books and this is by far the best I have had the pleasure to read."
4,"Works well, but obviously affects your aerodynamics.","4 stars out of 5 because I was suprised at how much it affected neck strain - but you're not buying this for comfort. Gets ALL the looks, lots of great reactions!"
5,"Easy to use, and very timely",">NET is a revolution in programming and this book is just the tool you need to quickly familiarize yourself with C#, the .NET framework and the Visual Studio Environment. With its series of step-by-step programming examples, you'll be happy to have this as a reference alongside your MSDN."
4,wanted to add to my david lindsey library,have read 3 books by this good thriller writerwanted to get as many more as i couldi'd rate almost all his books between 4-5 stars
4,Longstanding research,The genetics and linguistic part of the book is the result of a 20 year long research.Visit our web page http://www.chopo.pntic.mec.es/biolmol for details and further developments.
4,WEll done,It was a very moving account of dying. Told the story well. I loved the skill and expertise of the griefwalker.
2,Disappointing!,"This is a very cute set however, it's not very well made and the holders are free-standing so when a ball knocks against it they fall over. In regular croquet the wires are pushed into the ground so you don't have that problem. With kids . . . the stands are knocked over frequently so you have to run over and set them back up in order for the game to continue. I wouldn't buy this set again if I had it to do over. Disappointing!"
1,Beware! These are the small junior balls.,"As noted in another review below, these are the small junior juggling balls, but not labeled as such. This is deceptive by the seller. Other sellers stipulate that they are selling junior balls. I had ordered these in the past and they were regular size, but the company is now shipping small balls, charging the same price. You will note the size and dimensions are not noted. Stick with the Schylling Balls which are full sized and usually a better price. I go through these quickly as ideal chase and catch balls for my golden retriever. Soft for her mouth but enough heft to throw. As a juggler I want balls that are baseball or tennis ball size, not golf ball size like these."
1,Misrepresented,"I was extremely disappointed to receive ""small"" juggling balls. There is nothing in the item description which addresses the size, so I assumed they would be standard. However, when they arrived they were small and labeled as such. Very disappointing. Not worth returning and this is how the company gets you."
2,a lot smaller than expected,They work for the original juggling routine but if you are doing anything more advanced than that you need something a bit larger.
2,Juggling Balls,These juggling balls were okay and I suppose you can't complain about the price but I was hoping that they would be a better quality. They were not that round and were not soft enough to really deform into your hand when juggling. The really good juggling balls have an elastic outer cover and a finer filling.... this is the type you need to make juggling easier but it's difficult to know exactly what you are getting when buying online.
3,A little bigger and harder than I'd have liked...,"I ordered these as a present for my cousin. I can juggle a little bit, so I tried them out and they were a little larger and harder than I would have liked. I guess that makes the juggling more challenging, but if I could go back, I would have bought juggling balls in an actual store to make sure they were what I wanted. They do seem like good quality though."
3,"These are ""JUNIOR"" juggling bean balls","On the packaging these are called Junior Juggling Bean Balls. They are much smaller and lighter than regular bean balls. They work okay, but you would not want to mix them in with other balls. They do seem to be well made."
5,better than I expected,I have never tried juggling before. Bought these balls about a months aho and they feel just great in my hands.
5,FuN Projects in Physics,"Simple ans extremely informative, Janice VanCleave has placed science into a new realm where it is fun and educational, it makes a family experience out of the projects!"
4,History from another perspective,I read this book looking for answers. I grew up listening to stories that were almost identical to this book. I didn't understand why my mother was in a labor camp as a child after the war. Her family has made the same mistake of not leaving in time. The war was over and they niavely believed life would return to normal.It is good to know that someone has told the story.
1,Preposterous Excuse for a Book: Shameful,"""The Egyptian Origin of Christianity"" is incoherent. It's perfectly clear that an editor's pencil never touched a page of this self-published manuscript. It's equally clear the author is incapable of writing either transitional sentences or paragraphs. It would be more than generous to suggest this 'book' was a first draft; however it tracks more like a stack of note cards dropped on the floor and then recovered by a very diligent typist. I am disgusted that Amazon would participate in a business relationship with a vanity house without warning its customers that they might well be ordering incoherent trash."
2,not for scientists,"I read this book and... sorry, but can not recommend it for serious studies. The author obviously has not heard about Mircea Eliade. This work is somehow not serious and left me disappointed. Good, if you want to do some Sunday reading or have just begun your studies, but it is not serious. Sorry for that."
1,Big Fiasco,"The Egyptian Origin of Christianity is a very weak, poor documented, and superficial thesis, which barely deserves a Pass in College.Great title, poor contentDr. Juan C. Nogueira"
2,The Milagro Beanfield War,This book is difficult to read for a number of reasons. It is a massive tome in small print and I found it difficult to follow the characters. Eventually I gave up and rented the DVD that was adapted from the story.
1,Exhausting,"The book seemed tiring, drawn out, depressing and pointless. Without much of a plot, more like a 'day in the life', I was hoping for character studies woven into the northern New Mexico culture and lifestyle, but couldn't get past the pointless, helpless, hopeless, and frankly disturbing actions and interactions of these folks. (Maybe that in itself was the point) Perhaps symbolic, the constant barrage of dead, dying, maimed and killed animals was disturbing and distracting. Good commentary on Anglo vs Hispanic, rich vs poor, yuppies vs locals, past vs present, but the book simply WORE ME OUT!"
4,A small triumph; in a battle for the human soul.,"The Milagro Beanfield War is a warm, funny novel. John Nichols has an ear for humor, and creates well defined characters that are always warmly human. This includes the villains, who are never really evil; just a little too self-serving. This novel's only real flaw is an excess of these fine characters, which make it drag a bit in places. With a more linear plot, it would have been just about perfect"
2,too l970s,"Although my spouse liked the book and found it funny, I thought it was tedious, not funny. If I'd read it in the l970s Imight have enjoyed it more but a lot of its themes (environment, poor vs. rich, Hispanic communities) have been dealt with since then so that it's nothing new."
3,Good story,"I enjoyed this book, but I have to say it seemed long. The characters were interesting, but there seemed to be too many to get to attached or become personally involved with. My review probably has as much to to with my mind set as it does the book itself...probably should have opted for a quick read!I did love the setting and thought Nichols did a great job of describing it and bringing it to life.This book does seem like the perfect story for a movie!"
1,the hideous beeping...,"i bought this because i wanted a cheap digital camera to take photos with. when i finally got the thing turned on... it beeped for about 30 seconds and then shut itself off. many many times.i called tech support, and they said they'd exchange it because the camera was eating batteries. finally, after a half hour on the phone. all i have to say is... batman would not approve of this camera. it's loud, unrealiable, and bundled with irritating software. do not buy it."
1,Could this thing possibly be worse?,"We just bought this camera for our five year old son at Wal-Mart for $20. We have been wanting a camera for him and this sounded like a great buy. Unfortunately, when we brought it home and tried to use it, we could not get it to work at all. We tried using both an MMC and an SD but it would not work with either. After inserting the card, the camera would not do anything. It even locked up a couple of times, requiring the batteries be removed to turn the camera off. After doing this, the battery cover would not go back on and stay on.Needless to say, Wal-Mart will be getting this back! It's too bad I can't give 0 stars on here!"
1,Piece of Junk.,"Don't be seduced by the cool package. The camera is poorly made. The shutter button and battery compartment door both broke within a few days. It eats batteries if you try and use the flash. The picture quality is poor, but might charming for a toy, if it didn't break, and didn't cost so much. Shame on Kids Station for trying to pass off a piece of junk like this."
1,Ehhh.,A so-so product. It does give nails a foul taste but doesn't last. To be effective you would have to reapply it every time you wash your hands.Save your money. There are better products on the market.
1,Chasing a ghost,"I've read the core of this work. I am convinced that Dr. Kelly did not have anything close to the mathematical ability to read Einstein's original paper, which contains very difficult formulas.Instead, Dr. Kelly tried to get the gist of Einstein's ideas by reading the comments between the formulas. He siezed on one comment that seemed to equate rotating frames with inertial frames. In the book, Dr. Kelly's central argument is against this equivalence.But Einstein did not equate these frames at all - Dr. Kelly simply misinterpreted a comment in the dense, poorly annotated Relativity theory. And yet, when he encountered books that spelt out Relativity in plain terms, he insisted they were the ones misreading Einstein.Dr. Kelly's own 'theories' are mathematically facile and quickly lead to self-contradictions. There is a scientific mistake in the first paragraph of the first chapter. Perhaps the best use of the book is as an exercise for students, to find the errors?"
4,"Bright light, cheapy looking","The lamp is super bright! I LOVE the flexible, adjustable arm. It's perfect for my desk. Ehh, I still have a few reservations.The base was kinda big. It was still ok, and I understand that it was necessary to hold down the lamp, but I wouldn't have minded it if it was smaller. Also, the lamp bulb/tube seems expensive to replace or difficult to find replacements when broken. I've only had it for a month, but the bulb seems fine!Finally, the black lamp shade/cover thing is made of plastic. It also seems a bit warped, and both of these aspects make the lamp look kinda cheap.All in all, it still works great!"
5,This book was better than dessert.....,"Love, love, love this book! I finally feel I have the green light to decorate in the style I've always wanted. I was slightly afraid to put certain pieces out for show, but at the same time I didn't want to stash them in the closet. Everything has been set free and now I can breathe. Thank you Jonathan for your amazing talent, your fearless decorating style, and your oh, so hilarious advice on life."
2,flap is TOO long,"This is a nice enough hat overall but the back flap is way too long and is constanly bending up making it uncomfortable to wear. Plus, although the back and sides are of course designed for sun protection they tend to make the hat VERY hot to wear in humid conditions."
1,Army cap W15S44B,There is an obvious flaw in the material causing the cap to fit awkwardly and the flap is so short you might as well not have one. I contacted the store and they said that they would not let me return it. I would not recommend this product to anyone even if it was free.
4,The account of a husband & wife 4 yr trip around the world,"Just finished the book. It's a very good account of a small sailboat and it's trip around the world. A good mix of sailing technique, people they meet and all the joys and problems of a husband and wife taking 4 years to go 30,786 miles."
2,"Good support book, but other books needed.","When I was shopping for books about Virginia trails, I was looking for a overall good book with well laid out trails, simple maps, and trail insights. This book is not that book.I have the DeLorme atlas for Virginia so I could use these in tandem, but that would be much more time consuming given the alternatives available.I have used various online resources and the FalconGuide for Virginia to layout a much better hike. The book excels at telling what to expect along trails, but has too large of a scope to cover any one portion of the state in depth.If you are a long term resident and hiker in Virgina, this would be an interesting book to add to your collection as a reference. Do not buy this book if you are looking for pre-determined hike."
2,A dissapointment,"When I picked up this book I had high expectations,seeing that it had received good reviews.It opened quite spectacularly as well, on a rather surreal note.But as I read on, I couldn't help wondering what the point was in this rather incoherent, rambling tale.The book seemed like a sloppy, haphazard collection of incidents that didn't make much sense or assist character development. The central character herself was unbelievable and I found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights.It seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip,cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky. Some incidents were quite mirth-provoking, however,that's why I gave it two stars."
3,All physical sensation and no soul,"This novel reminded me of Camus' The Stranger. All physical sensation and no soul. Morvern spends her days thinking: ""eat, yawn, sleep, dance, I used the goldish lighter on a Silk Cut."" I think Warner's a gifted writer. I liked the language of the novel and the fresh perspective. But enough with the sudsy bathtub scenes. Frankly, I'm tired of male writers (writing from the female perspective) including scenes like this in their books. They can't really pull it off. To quote Morvern, I'm in ""hysterics"" every time Morvern and Lanna ""lather each other up"" in the tub (yet again!). Warner can keep his fantasies to himself. Because that's how it came off."
2,Maybe you should just see the movie,"The following is a synopsis of one of the scenes in _Morvern Callar_. It doesn't involve major characters and it doesn't reveal a plot point, but it does give something of the book's tone.It's Hogmanay. The narrator and her social circle have gathered in a local hotel. Midnight passes, then closing time, so the police come to make them leave. One man buys several whiskies and wants to take them with him but the police won't let him, so he pours the whiskies down the throat of his fish, takes the fish outside, and drinks the whiskies out of the fish's mouth.If that baffled you, you should probably skip the book entirely. In short, it's so Scottish it probably won't travel well."
3,Too strange to put down,"I bought Morvern Caller in order to read a book with the flavor of the countryside I was to visit. I was hoping to get a feel for the people of the west coast of Scotland while I was enjoying its scenery. Instead, I found myself reading a book about troubled people, characters I could not imagine meeting in the real world. Morvern Caller is well written and very disturbing. It's difficult to ""enjoy"" the lives of its characters since they suffer from more than ordinary problems. It's also difficult to put the book down without finishing it. For enjoyment level, I wanted to give this book a one or two; for interest level, I had to rate it higher. And, then, I was compelled to read its sequel! You want to know what happens, all the while wishing you were reading something else!!"
4,Unlikable but interesting,Morvern is a heroine and we want out heroines to be our friends. The single most depressing aspect of this novel is that it relates a tale about someone who isn't at all likeable and who wouldn't want to have anything to do with you.Having said that it is a special book just don't read it if you are feeling a bit fragile about yourself.
3,NOT FOR THE LAYMAN.,"NOT QUITE WHAT WAS NEEDED IN MY CASE. NEED TO IMPROVE ON DESCRIPTION OF CONTENTS, MEDICAL LEVELIE: DOCTOR NURSE, MEDICAL ASSISTANT, ORDINARY LAYMAN, ETC. JAPANESE DIALECT USED IN PRINT, POTENIAL CUSTOMERS NEED TO DELVE INTO CONTENTS DEEPLY BEFORE PURCHASING. NOT RECOMENDED FOR NON MEDICAL PERSONNEL"
2,"Gospel is important, but let's not get carried away. .","This book, in my opinion, was written from the perspective of a fan. There are numerous books written on music by music scholars (e.g., Early Jazz by Gunther Schuller) which I prefer to this type of writing because the authors ideas are backed up by examples that include musical knowledge and music history knowledge. Heilbut make many statements about the importance of Gospel music as an influence on US pop music that are untrue and not backed up with any facts or examples. I did enjoy the stories about some the key architects of the gospel sound, but the ""religious fanatical"" perspective of the author turned me off. I know enough about music and US music history to know when the author was getting emotional about a music that touched him personally. This is a problem if the reader is not educated in music and US music history, they may take the many fantastic claims that Heilbut makes about Gospel music as truth."
2,French Designers,I felt that this book was a nice collection of work by French designers. It depicted various French designers work in various styles. It did not however show French style. This was what I was hoping to see.
4,Stylish French Interiors,"While one might disagree that this is as grand a book as the title states, this reviewer is satisfied that it is indeed a good presentation of interiors in the many styles associated with French design. Here, the history begins with the 1930s, however, and the majority of the examples are from current times, all presumably previously published in ELLE DECOR magazine. But traditional styles are well represented with chic examples such as an office pavillion decorated by Francois-Joseph Graff for Pierre Berge -- a good arguement for working at home. While it is not an instructive book on style as such, careful study of the photos should provide inspiration to all interested in interior design, regardless of budget."
1,Not What You Are Hoping For!,"Having several books on French style and French Country style, many showcasing homes in France, this book is a huge disappointment. Few of the rooms are stylish, but rather, well just junky. I was looking forward to another look at French style in France, not just the interpretation of such in America. This is a coffee table book for those who have little design sense."
3,"They look good, BUT","OK they were cheap and an afterthought purchase. They are P-L-A-S-T-I-C not metal and easily crossthread on valve stems. They don't look bad when installed but I don't know how long they will last. Not long, I suspect, but what do you want for $2.99?"
4,All the Goths love Emily,"Enter the gloomy and eldritch world of Emily! The artwork is inspired, the aphorisms hit below the belt, and the glossary of Emily's personal secret glyphs is worth the price of the book all by itself. Emily may not like you, but you'll like her."
5,Cool Book,"I actually had never heard of the Emily books, untill my friend showed me her autographed copy of this book & I fell in love, my copy is on the way via mail, this book has neat pictures with very cool secret writing on each page. A fun book for anyone."
4,A little strange,"Emily's Book of Strange (Emily the Strange)is a companion book toEmily the Strange: Lost, Dark and Bored, Volume 1 (Emily the Strange: Dark. Horse Comics) (Vol 1).The book contains beautiful, if strange, illustrations and very little dialogue. ""Emily sees the world through a tangled web"" and the illustrations are supportive of this view. The art work is fascinating to stare at and would be great blown up into posters for a Halloween theme!If you like Emily the Strange, you'll love this book."
1,Garbage Do not buy,I purchased this product blind. It started out difficult as there were no Vista Drivers on the website and had to go with Beta. They did not install well but finally worked. I had the product for a year and used multiple times and it was very quirky. After a significant vacation I went to download my pictures and it wiped out my disk. I lost all the pictures. I emailed support to get no response.After this I bought and HP wirless Photo Printer with slots for Digital Camera cards and all works better.Do not buy this product.
1,Waste of Money,"I used this card reader twice. I will never use it again! I would give it 0 or negative stars if I could!!The first time I used it, I was able to download my pictures and they appeared fine, but I didn't download all of my pictures from my card. I put the card back in my camera and the camera wanted to format it or shut off. I put the card back in the card reader and it didn't recognize the card. I lost those pictures.The second time I used it I put the card in the reader and downloaded two copies of my pictures (just in case). Half of those pictures are messed up, either the bottom portion of the picture is missing, or the bottom portion of the picture is skewed off center while the rest of the picture is fine. Almost immediatly after downloading the pictures my computer became unstable and I had to restart. Again when I put the card in the camera it wanted to reformat it.Don't waste your money and time with this junk!"
1,"Killer NIC's are scams, do the same as regular gigabit NIC.",Killer NIC's are a scam and do the exact same thing as regular gigabit NIC's.Throttling and prioritizing packets.Many review sites including tomshardware have concluded that there is absolutely no difference between Bigfoots Killer NIC's and regular industry standard NIC's.Research it yourself before your buy. Spend that money on a GPU or a CPU (something that WILL impact performance).It's a scam.
1,This Item destroy's all NICS on your PC,"After multiple attempts at getting this card to work (re-installations, cleaning out the registry) I decided to let it be and use my onboard NIC. This is where the fun began and everything I did would not work saying the NIC had limited connectivity and could not renew an IP address. Mind you, the drivers I was using were from June 4th, 2008 and I had to reinstall windows to get connectivity back.Definitely do not purchase this because it messes up your pc NIC, is way overpriced, has non-existent customer phone support and the kicker is they actively censor any technical problems/issues you post on forums or anywhere else! Very shady and I would highly recommend to avoid and save yourself the nightmare of installing this junk."
1,Make sure,"This might be a good product if you have the internet connections you need to make this work. However it did nothing to my grandson's computer and he has a Alien. So just make sure if you are going to purchase this, check with your internet provider, that this product will work on your computer."
5,My favorite of all time,I love this CD. Funny Girl is my favorite of all time. I know every word and inflection of these songs. Barbra at her best.
4,Extraordinary debut,"This a terrific debut novel unlike anything that's come out in years: a touching, poetic story about a confused schoolgirl and the unlikely (and definitely unseemly) friendship she strikes up with her chemistry teacher. McGowan writes like someone who's read lots of Joyce, Faulkner, Virginia Woolf, Nabokov, etc. The book can be tough going at times--you need to read it very slowly to follow it, let alone savor it--but it's certainly worth second you devote to it."
1,Form may appeal to those with degrees in English Lit.,"Ack! I cannot abide by this writing style. It reminds me of Rick Moody. It's too cool, snide, disjointed, and artificial. I can't get past the first 50 pages. It's a ""literary tour de force"" if you like pretension walloping you upside the head like a two by four. I can read difficult literature, appreciate the themes, enjoy the metaphors, etc., but I refuse to work this hard in my leisure time to understand the story hidden within the obnoxious prose. Out of my reading pile, damned book, OUT!"
1,Pretentious Garbl - E - Gook!,"Who wants to work so hard to read a novel? The language of the book is so difficult to decipher that one must go slow, reread, and read outloud. Working so hard to comprehend the complexity of the writing (not the actual simple story) is anything but enjoyable. Consequently, caring about finishing the text, or caring for any of the the characters is impossible. A total waste... Teenage angst and confusion takes on a life of it's own in this author's hands!"
1,Maybe its just me...,"but this book made no sense at all. I couldn't understand anything. I made it through the first couple of pages and couldn't go any further. It was awful. Maybe its just me, but this book was very poorly written, and I can't understand how it ever got published in the first place."
1,A Chore,"On a scale of 1 to 5, this first novel by Heather McGowan barely gets a 1. Ok, if you like novelty and struggling through endless sentences without punctuation, then this may be for you. But, I was not amused and found myself missing the flow of a novel well written and punctuated. The story line had great potential, but the form detracted from it to the point that the story was lost. Try again."
1,Bitter Disapointment,"With tremendous anticipation, I opened this book on a recent plane trip. The reviews in multiple sources were stellar and, as a voluminous reader, I looked forward to the challenge and stimulation of something different and intelligent. I was frustrated beyond description at my inability to fall into the flow of this story. Sure that the narrative would gel, I read on and on, but ultimately tossed the book into the wastecan with a sense of defeat. Perhaps my sensibilities have been dulled by years in the legal profession or I am too far removed from adolescence; this story didn't get through to me on any level."
2,Really Quite Difficult,"I opened this much-heralded book with the best of intentions. I am accustomed to difficult texts and had anticipated being challenged and invigorated by McGowan's story based on the ample advance publicity ""Schooling"" had engendered. Unfortunately, I found that the effort I expended in reading the book failed to be adequately rewarded. A book this stylistically inclined should have a grand theme to sustain, to sweep the reader along, to enable him or her to lie back with languid passion and husk, ""Take me...I'm yours..."" McGowan's tome got a cranky ""Oh, all right!"" out of me, at best. I think it's a book from a young lady with a lot of potential, plus perhaps a lot of personal problems she needs to work out. I'm looking forward, though hardly holding my breath, to her next. Heaven only can help us if it's ""Graduate Schooling,"" or ""Left Back""!"
5,quiet riot,"i read a review of this book in my newspaper. they called it 'jane eyre on mushrooms.' i had to check it out. and it rocks! i loved it so much. i'm only seventeen but this book really captured how #$%^ it is when you're a smart, curious girl and you're surrounded by people who want you to shut up. i mean there was more going on than that. it was just really beautiful amd intense and i think you should all read it and weep!!!! peace out."
1,MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SHEETS EVER MADE,"These sheets are strictly for apprearances. I bought them for my almost 5 year old son who LOVES Star Wars. He was very excited about them, but they were stiff and felt like a nylon curtain. As cute as they appear, I would NOT recommend buying them to sleep on. After several washings, they softened up only a little. I have to put another sheet under them and another pillow case under the pillow case in an attempt to make them bearable."
1,"Really cheap, uncomfortable sheets","I bought these sheets for my 3-year-old who is a huge Star Wars fan (thanks to his 7-year-old brother!). They are probably the WORST-quality sheets I have ever come across. Scratchy, stiff, sheer, they really are for looks only. I am going to take the suggestion of the reviewer below and put extra sheets underneath to see if that makes them even slightly more comfortable. If I had known what poor quality these were I definitely would not have bought them."
1,I AGREE!,"I bought this sheet set, the newest blue comforter with the light saber duel, and the micro bead pillow as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old son. He, too, loves Star Wars...and as I read the other reviews, Im nodding my head. THESE SHEETS FEEL LIKE BURLAP! I have washed them regularly since December...with no improvement. They dont fade, though..which I suppose was the motivation behind the manufacturer making them with 70% polyester and only 30% cotton. VERY STIFF AND SCRATCHY!"
1,Images on bedding are scary and make good guys like Yoda look evil and crazy.Sheets are stiff and hard to wash.,"I disliked these sheets for my son not only because of the poor quality but because of the character portrayals.Why is a wise,all knowing character like Yoda pictured as an evil and scary looking? He looks nothing like the Yoda my six year old son came to know and love in the Star Wars series. His rather crazed look on this bedding would probably cause an adult to have nightmares.I am still looking for Star Wars bedding for my son and have now resorted to vintage 1970's sheets from Ebay which at least are soft and have accurate character representations."
4,Star Wars Galactic Hereos Twin Sheet Set,"I purchased this product. I was apprehensive, but the set turned out to be perfect. This set is not for deep mattresses but the regular ones. My son has a regular size mattress, so this set fits perfectly. THANKS!"
2,Not Impressed,This sheet set was a gift for my grandson. The quality of the fabric leaves much to be desired. The sheets remain very stiff and scratchy even after laundering. I was not impressed with the quality.
3,Mom of Two..,"My sons were really happy with these sheets. The color is great. The sheets are very rough and the material is thin. Washing them did not change the texture. Great design, horrible fabric."
5,Great learning tool,This book provide a great read understanding the basic foundation to the process of making medicine/drug. I appreciate the amount of effort the author has put into making this textbook enjoyable to read.
5,Good buy for a medicinal chemistry course.,I am glad I bought this book. It is helpful in my understanding of medicinal chemistry. I would recommend this book and amazon service to another student.
2,The best picture is the one on the cover!.,"The author states that this book is aimed at undergraduates who have a basic grounding in chemistry and are interested in a future career in the pharmaceutical industry.Chemistry background includes now elements of quantum chemistry and molecular orbital theory. The author completely fails in including these elements in the Chapter on Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships.Moreover, he seems completely unaware of the fundamental contributions of Quantum Chemistry to QSAR.This text could perfectly include elements of (INTRODUCTORY) quantum-chemical applications to QSAR (the scientific literature is full).We must wait until the next edition to get a book that can be recommended to serious students!.Juan S. Gomez-JeriaAssociate ProfessorFaculty of SciencesUniversity of Chile."
2,Picture is deceptive,"Ball is actually light orange in color not red. Also, there's no foam whatsoever in the ball. It's all kind of rubbery and is about as light as those cheap bouncy balls that you see in Target or Walmart. A bit disappointed considering I paid $12 for this including shipping."
5,great book!,"This book is very informative, well written, and easy to read. I read another one that was very opinionated. This one gives their opinion, but in a very un-biased way."
2,A childbirth book for women who hate men,"If you're a shouting feminist and single mother-to-be, you'll probably enjoy this book. If, however, you aren't, then read ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" instead of this screed. Kitzinger can't seem to help editorializing about the supposed past degradation of women in childbirth, all at the hands of men. The commentary was both insulting and irrelevant. Beyond that, the book is nothing more--or less--than your run-of-the-mill informative book on childbrith."
2,outdated information,"I thought this book was really agenda-heavy (as pregnancy guides unfortunately can be!). This one has a natural birth agenda. There is a lot of scaremongering around medical interventions... one of them being the CVS genetic test. The author's info is really outdated, so be sure to read something more properly researched if you are exploring this option. I am giving it 2 stars for the interesting illustrations and photos, which is why I bought it."
2,Woo,"This book is informative and generally sound. Some of its assertions are backed up with scientific studies, which are referred to in a bibliography. However, many assertions about ""healthy energy"" and similar ideas are made that aren't supported by anything at all. As such, it's too new-agey for my taste.I would highly recommendPregnancy, Childbirth, and the Newborninstead."
4,An Amazing Resource!,"I rated this book 4/5 stars because I find (although not often!!) that some of the information is outdated or incorrect. Overall though I absolutely love this book. I have turned to it multiple times throughout my current pregnancy, AND I have used it as a resource for many of my midwifery classes.The language is simple and clear and there are also lots of pictures and illustrations throughout. I love the homebirth and waterbirth photos!"
5,The best baby book ever,"This is the best pregnancy and childbirth book ever written. My wife and I picked up a copy in Kenya when we were pregnant with our first child. The information was great, and it helped us through that pregnancy."
3,Doesn't smell like Patchouli...,"I bought it because it was cheap. You get what you pay for I guess. It doesn't smell like Patchouli. It smells like generic gas station ""incense."" If you just want something cheap that smokes and makes a vaguely incense-y smell, I guess it is worth it. Just don't expect it to smell even remotely like Patchouli.Edit 03/26/2012 : This incense still sucks and still doesn't smell anything like patchouli."
2,Smells like I lit a stick on fire,"I would give the scent a 0 out of 5, it smells like firewood, not incense. The two stars are because the little ceramic holder is nice (not great), and these incense do seem to burn more cleanly than other brands, there is no cloud of smoke left in the room. Overall, not worth the price, doesn't smell a bit like patchouli."
1,Bad,Reviewed this once already and the shipper complained until they took off my review. So they are trying to hide the fact these are not normal incense sticks. These are tiny Japanese sticks. I hated them. They are super fragile. Who buys this crap?
4,"Not the Best Story, But Entertaining","As my title says, it didn't have the most in depth story but was entertaining nonetheless. The animation was real good, and the historical flashbacks were pretty cool as well."
2,Meh,"This didn't impress me to much. Not worth buying in my opinion. I enjoy highlander movies and some animated stuff, like Vampire Hunter D, Ghost in the Shell and such. This movie does not stand out."
4,Good Take On The Highlander Legend!,"On this take of the Highlander legend, we find a Scotsman named Colin who was born in the 2nd Century when his clan was killed by an immortal named Marcus Octavius who was a Roman emperor at the time. He was also killed by this same immortal but returned as one himself.Years later, he was adopted by the clan Macleod and was killed in battle but came back again. Like Connor and Duncan, he was rejected by the clan as he continued to search for Octavius.In the modern era, he finally finds him but now has to make a choice between love & honor Vs. pure vengence as the people in the city are dying but his lust for revenge for his clan has not abated.While not a great film, it is certainly better than the recent trash known as The Source! The animation for it is nothing groundbreaking but good! The Highlander story is tailor-made for anime and we can only hope there are more features."
3,entertaining to say the least,"This ones alright. The fact that the Highlander has lived all this time, supposedly met his true love over and over again, and never realized it, gets his ultimate revenge, and still never figures ""it"" out while the villian has, is, well, frustrating. By the end, I almost wanted the bad guy to win just because he has figured out through the time he has walked the earth, to better himself in so many ways. The hero is only led by revenge and, even with the help of a spiritual guide, is still lost. The guide eventually gives up on him. As an animated piece, its entertaining. I dont think i would say rush out and buy it. That is unless you dont care about such things. My opinion, things like this storyline, frustrtate me. I guess though, it is called the search for vengeance, so what do you expect. Just my opinion."
5,"""VENGEANCE"" RULES!","I have to admit, when I first that the producers of the ""Highlander"" franchise were producing an anime film, I was intrigued. I've never been a huge fan of anime, but the idea was an interesting one. And the final project more than delivers. David Abramowitz, who served as head writer on the television series, has crafted an exceptional story that combines the best of ""Highlander"" with the best of anime. The animation is exceptional, with fantastic visual effects and outstanding fight sequences. The voice cast does an exceptional job with the characters. ""Highlander: The Search for Vengeance"" is a fantastic anime film that will please both ""Highlander"" fans and fans of Japanese anime!Movie/DVD Grade: A"
4,Worth the Cash,"I have only played the game for an hour or so, but my first impression was a good one. It's definitely worth the money, and the sooner you buy it, the more likely you are to get the limited edition. It costs the same, but it comes with extra levels. I figure they did that to get people to buy it right after Christmas (when brand new games aren't sold as well).I'm not a huge mech-fan; I don't usually play mech games, but this game does a really great job at mixing in a few different elements. There are quite a few different types of mechs, and you can switch between them during the mission. You can even hijack an enemy's mech! Also, the entire environment is destructible. A building in your way? Knock it down.Overall, this game is a great game. I research my games thoroughly before buying them, and this one was a no-brainer."
1,A step backwards/downwards from the first game,"Many are drawn to mech/giant robot games for options, customization, etc. The first Mechassault didn't have this, but managed to save itself by allowing each person to pick their own machine, to suit their own style of play. There were some balance issues, which the developers of this NEW game decided to handle in the worst way possible - removing ALL choice.When a battle starts, you are not in a mech at all, and have to find a vehicle and hope it suits your style. If it doesn't, you'll likely be killed, and respawn in the little micro-suit again, and again try desperately to find a mech.Even if you ignore this horrible design choice, the game just isn't all that much fun...sad, as the first was a good straightforward pick-up-and-play game, and this game is just...disappointing."
3,Would Have Been Great if it would have worked on the 360!,I bought this for a friend for xmas because he was a huge fan of the game when it came out. I did my research and found out that Mech assault 2 is compatible with the xbox 360. When it arrived it would not work in the 360. Turns out that because it is specifically the limited edition version it will not work... Such a shame.
2,"Nice theme, but bad game.","This game is ok, to say the best for it. It still is nt very good though. As the title says, ""Nice theme, but bad game."" The battle system is not very exciting, and you generally are going very slow. Not very exciting. The mechs are ok, but I found the battle armour was the more effective weapon. It does not nearly hold its own against ANY other game on the market in Xbox Live."
5,HECK YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is awsome and it is worth the money. THe graphics are great and there is more than 25 levels unlike those cheap gamesthat have only 15 to 20 levels. the story line is great and every thing is great. DO NOT HAVE ANY DOUBT ON BUYING THIS GAME!!!!!!!P.S THIS GAME IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HECK YES!!!!!!!
5,Movie,"I think it is a very good movie ,about what I expected from Masterpiece theater,I spent three years in England after the Korean war and it had not changed much,very good movie,as much about the people as the war."
3,All the Stock Characters,"In the vein of ""Glory,"" All the King's Men is about a regimen of ill-fated soldiers who meet their demise during a military offensive. Unlike ""Glory"" these troops are more stock and less flesh. They seem two-dimensional, excepting Emma Cunniffe's character as the new bride and Ian McDiarmid's performance as the Reverend who was willing to lie to protect the mentality of the sole survivor of this regimen. The overall message in All the King's Men prevails: There is no glory in war and battles only senseless tragedy and death."
2,sentimental claptrap,"I have been reading wonderful literature about world war 1 , Ireland and the British ""Empire"".This movie stands in starkly weak comparison to the daring and provocative narratives offered of this tumultuous time period.This film was a tepid piece of priviledged white impotence. gag me ."
4,All the King's Men,"Slightly stuffy and fractured, but that really doesn't change this PBS miniseries' special qualities at all. Maggie Smith is quite good in her role, and adds humour to it as well. The other cast members are excellent, with direction and writing at tops.A must if you enjoy Masterpiece Theater."
4,Destiny Finally Fulfilled,"It is very hard to imagine Destiny's Child when it really comes to some true songs in R&B.; They've really nmade some songs that move you from the feet, but not yet from the heart. Their latest single finally brings that out after all this time. Cater 2 U, the fourth single from Destiny Fulfilled is a tender that Beyonce' and company really bring out a better job with. This is a very nice song that really has a beautiful melody, and doesn't lose any ground after awhile. Yet, it is very sad that they are seperating after this single. They finally have caught the groove after all this time.Song: B-"
4,The Perfect Sequel,"Obviously Mrs. King had more story to tell when she completed her first novel, and this book is the perfect sequel. It picks up with the lives of the main characters and a few lesser characters and weaves their stories as skillfully as the first novel. As before, this is pure entertainment in the old fashioned story telling genre. Thank goodness there are still authors out there who do not think they have to shock readers with every conceivable foul word or behavior!"
4,"If you are 40 and over, you will really enjoy this book",This book was a quick read and good for deep hearted laughter. I say it is for those over 40 as you have to have lived some of life to see the realistic humor and feel it as well. Enjoy!
5,Sturdy and functional,"This table is just the right size for everything when camping - great height, not too deep. I keep a few items right on the table like a tissue box, etc., and still have enough room to prepare food. Best of all, I no longer have to install the legs on my heavy iron propane stove because I can set it on the metal fold-up shelf. Two medium coolers can fit underneath and have room to open (I take the metal shelf that normally installs underneath the green table part and hang it on the wall and put hooks on it to hang utensils and pots so that they don't scratch the wall. I use separately-purchased spring oval clips to hang the shelf from my window.) I have a small fold-up stool so that I can eat there as well. Highly recommended."
4,Spacious and handy,"I just bought this on clearance for 75% off at Target and I think it will work out great. My first impression was that the table top looks flimsy (this is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) But it says it can hold 400 lbs (and they have a small picture on the box showing it holding a stack of cinder blocks) so I guess it really is stronger than it appears. It is not super-light, but it's not too heavy either; probably similar weight to the exterior wood table that came with my camper. I'll gladly leave the old wood one behind and take this one; it looks better, it's larger and won't need to be attached to the camper -- I can place it anywhere. I'm hoping the grill shelf is big enought to hold my Coleman ""Grill to Go"" -- I think it should be."
1,Not what I expected,"I tough this was a great ball, but it got bad really soon, I put not much air to make it last but the plastic thing inside came out after playing a few hours in a swimming pool.. really bad product... NOT Recommended."
4,Soft Volleyball,"This product was delivered quickly and as shown. It wasn't as soft as we expected, but is softer than the typical volleyball, and determining degree of softness is difficult via picture or description. My daughter and her siblings and friends use this ball frequently and it has held up well. They prefer this to the typical volleyball particularly for backyard use and practice of volleyball since it is softer. Although it is softer, it is still firm enough to bounce well. It seems to be well made and was very reasonably priced. Overall, a great ball."
3,Steak knives,"The knives are pretty cheaply made. They're also a little shorter than other steak knives I've owned in the past. They are, however, very, very sharp!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"After reading the reviews I thought these would be better than they are. While they will cut a tomato pretty well, I don't like them for meat or chicken; the serrated edge definitely tears the meat. And I've had a few get rust spots--although a little bit of ""Barkeepers Friend"" worked wonders. Good for picnics and outdoor events because if they accidentally get thrown away they're very easily replaceable."
2,Terrible quality,"A week after I got these knives, I was using one of them to cut a slice of gouda cheese. It's not like this should be a difficult task for a knife. However, the joint between the handle and blade completely failed and the knife broke in half. Obviously these are not full tang knives.I gave two stars instead of one because I still have 11 knives left, and it's not like I wasted a lot of money on it. But I'll have to be careful not to use these knives for anything that would put any kind of stress on the weak handle/blade joint."
3,Not that small,"I got this to use as a replacement for my wallet in hopes that it would be considerably smaller. After putting 3 cards and some cash in, I don't think it was that much smaller than my wallet, so I'm returning it. It seems to be of good quality, just not what I was looking for."
2,Elastic wears out,"I was thrilled with this wallet at first, and was showing it to my friends. But, after 5 months, the elastic wore out so that the wallet wasn't useful anymore. I ended up ordering a card holder instead: which is actually even thinner! I wish I could get my money back for this wallet."
2,Decent just not up to par quality.,The elastic straps are too thin and the two sides of the wallet dont sit together snuggly when closed. Recommend going for one that has thicker straps as well. Thicker straps will hold folded money much better.
2,Too floppy,"I am always looking for a slim wallet. I carry my wallet in my front pocket and I hate any extra bulk, so I though this might be great. It sadly was not what I was looking for. The elastic bands just don't seem to hold it together very tightly and I could see that if you carried a big wad of cash for any significant period of time and then took it out that there would be stretching and a departure from its original form. I have friends who have wallets like this and seem to be happy, it's just not for me."
5,great,"good, but if you want my review don't make it so hard. I'll give you the stars only next time or not at all!"
4,Sky Blue BDUs,"Very satisfied with the quality of these shorts. They fit better than I expected, the adjustable waist band made them fit just right. I would buy from this manufacture again."
2,Camoflaged Cargo Shorts but with buttons,This shorts isn't true to size (too small ) and doesn't have a zipper ! All buttons instead.I chose to return it as it had buttons and not a zipper.
3,They are alright,"Well the shoes themselves were just ok. They weren't really what the picture depicted. They are a little uncomfortable. And I didn't excpect the grey to be so dark and dominant. I will DEFINATELY be thinking it through again before I make a purchase. I buy shoes online ALL the time, through Overstock.com, footlocker.com, and other websites. I have had only one bad purchasing experience."
5,A Magical Look at Common Animals,"A charming board book without text that depicts all-time favorite animals of small children. With lovely, magical illustrations of a hen, duck, squirrel, etc. your child will delight at learning what all these animals are, without the jarring ugliness of so many modern illustrations. These illustrations are gentle, with beautiful pastel colors and remind us of the angelic time of being young. My children all love it!"
5,The Building Blocks of Life,"LEGOs are such a wonderful toy. They build coordination, color identification, and motor skills. Not only are they good for the mind, but so much fun in the process! Together, we built a life-sized Duplo version of my son at the age of three. He was impressed!"
5,An all time classic!,"This is a beautiful toy. I use to play with legos when I was a child and I love that they still are around. I didn't know if buy the regular legos, but the duplos have the perfect size for my 2 year old hands and will last enough time before I introduce him to the next level. The only down side is the price, too expensive for the amount of pieces that come in the box. If you're a fan, you will need more buckets to build something bigger and that will cost!"
1,bad add info,"Nothing in the add said anything about adaptors need to use with the EOS system and nowhere were any offered I would actully rate this at below 1-star since it is totally useless at it arrive. Also among the worst instructions we in the package. Definitely a candidate for the ""Gong Show"""
1,"Sham, Wow!","Perhaps someone may explain how by affixing a simple tube of 4 1/2"" length to the front of a lens with a minimum focus distance of 12"", is supposed to produce a usable image. If so, I'd like to hear how it's accomplished. What makes it doubly laughable is that Adorama and Opteka themselves attest to the viability of this, and get this; ""OPTIMAL FOCAL LENGTH FOR THIS PRODUCT TO USE, IS 70MM!"" What a hoot! My Canon 100mm Macro focuses down to 12"", both parties mentioned, advised me to use my 70-200mm, which minimum focus distance is 3.5'. Unless the Opteka HD slide copier had optics of its own, (it does not) how exactly, would that be possible? Rhetorical question, it can't."
4,Opteka Digital Duplicator HD2,"For the price, this device works quite well as a quicker alternative to scanning slides, useful if you have many old slides to get through (although the best ones might still be worth scanning). I'm using it with a Canon DSLR (EOS450D known as Rebel XSi in USA) and getting decent results at f/11 and 80mm, at least when the original slide is well exposed and focused. Auto-focusing and exposure generally work well enough. Fortunately, however, I still have an old EF 28-80 USM lens (that came with my Canon EOS100 back in 1992), because neither of the two new EF-S lenses that I now have can work with this device. The kit EF-S 18-55 mm IS lens is too wide angle (the Opteka needs a focal length around 80 mm) and the EF-S 55-250 mm IS cannot focus close enough. Many people might only have these lenses so would be unable to work with the Opteka."
3,Works well,"This is a good alternative, for the price, for transferring slides to a digital format. For lighting, I am using a halogen desk lamp bounced off of a piece of white poster board. If I use the light directly I get a ""pebbled"" effect from the built in diffuser. The magnification using the standard lens with the Canon EOS Rebel doesn't fill the sensor area so I have to crop the resulting image. But I'm too cheap to spend $100's of dollars for another lens.Some of my slides fit too tightly into the holder so I've had trouble with the focus getting messed up as I push the slide in. (Because the lens on the camera rotates more easily than the barrel.) My work-around is to use auto-focus, after the initial setup, and then the slide gets rotated back into the correct position as the camera focuses."
3,Works ok - needs +2 close-up with it for filling the frame,"I have Sony A33 and think this would be helpful for Canon dslr users.The slide copier works with 18-55mm lens at 55mm on Sony A33. The images are ok to good quality (not great). Slide doesn't take up the whole frame. I used a +2 close-up filter/lens on my 55-200mm lens so it would focus ok (can't without it) and I could zoom in to fill the viewfinder (about 70mm) or zoom more to crop the slide. The rotating end with the slide is stiff and have to hold the other end when aligning slide. This is cheap China plastic stuff. My slide duplicator from the 90's for film or full frame dslr's is metal and has a zoom built in to it, much better quality feeling. As stated this slide copier does work (don't expect much for $30), but has issues."
1,Poor design,Very disapointed.No way to use negative strips.Image is croped significantly and a lot of definition is lost there. a better choice of the lens would minimize thisThe slide magazine is too tight making very difficult to introduce and remove ordinary paper frame slide and impossible to use plastic frames.
2,A step down,"Bought this based on read reviews. Does not live up to it. Photos are highly vignetted and the position of the slide holder is offset from center (when zooming in to get better frame filling you lose the bottom of the pictureThis is used with a Canon 50d with a 24-105 f4L lens.I used the Opteka to scan two trips from Jamaica and Breckenridge (shot in raw for maximum ability to adjust) and then compared them to a Plustec 7500i scanner in Lightroom 3.4.PlusesThe scans took a fraction of the time- one role - 10 minutes vs 2 hours.Color saturation and post processing.NegativesHigh vignettingmisalignmentsome distortion caused by the Opteka lens, (high aberration)no ability to clean up artifacts (Plustec with Silverfast use a uv scan to remove)More after scan processing.ConclusionIf you do want a cheap way of scanning old slides and just want to make some 4 x 6's then go ahead and buy. But if you want higher quality scans, stick with a dedicated scanner."
3,Opteka HD2,This does not work easily with a Canon Zoom lenses. The front element of the zoom moves in and out when you zoom and the attached Opteka jams the lens. No harm is done if you go carefully but it is best to watch what you are doing when you zoom to maximize the picture. In addition the housing for the slide tends to slide up and down because the spring tension is so light on the slide holder. Otherwise it works OK
3,did not state size of adapter ring it came with,"I just checked the info given again about this product. It states that it is for a Canon Eos, I did not, however, state the size of the lens. I have one Canon lens that is 67mm, I also have a couple of compatible lens, but neither are the 58mm which fits the 58mm-52mm step down ring they send with this product. I now must order more rings before I can begin using the product."
4,Great for the money,"I've used this copier to copy over 700 slides and I'm reasonably pleased with the results.pros: inexpensive and does a pretty good job of copying, resolution could be better but then you're talking a more expensive scanner and much more time copying.cons: insertion of the slides can be tricky (actually it drove me a little nutty, but I lack patience), f/11 is supposed to work best but my camera does not always allow it so I switch to a different setting, you MUST straighten each slide (just get it reasonably straight using the duplicator then adjust in your software)"
3,A Useful Purchase,I do a lot of genealogy work and there are many times when dragging a flatbed scanner along with you is not practical. The Slide Copier makes a good attachment for my camera in case there is a need for 35mm scanning. The quality of the copying is acceptable.
5,An Excellent Resource for the Spiritually Weary,"As a busy mom of three, I know the value of taking a time out -- I just didn't know how peaceful, uplifting, and encouraging they can be. In her book, Grace Fox has mastered the art of weaving a story alongside tender Spiritual truths. I've found Ten-Minuite Time Outs for Busy Women to be invaluable in my search for a quiet time in between the chaos of being a woman on the run.Jenn Doucette, author of The Velveteen Mommy (NavPress)"
5,Inspiring and Refreshing,"This book is rich with insights and encouragement. Grace Fox, an excellent writer, teaches from stories -- drawn from both her life and from many other people's -- to gently lead her readers to a deeper encounter with God.I especially loved the way she weaves in the text of hymns, bringing in that wisdom from the past. This is just the book I've needed. I'm buying several copies to give as gifts."
5,WOW price,"The price for this book was awesome, I couldn't believe it. The book was $250 at my college bookstore and is required for a core class in my degree. I could not believe how cheaply I got this."
4,Nice firm stopping,"I purchased these for my Town & Country minivan because I wanted better brakes when pulling my double-waverunner trailer. I put them on both front and rear. I got what I was looking for! There were times with the stock pads that I just didn't know if I was going to be able to stop in time .... when I would end up 2 or 3 feet past the line at a stoplight that had changed quickly, or way too close to the vehicle in front of me. That problem is gone. When I apply the brakes, now, they grab and hold and I have no doubts that my stopping ability is assured. They have made a world of difference in my confidence when pulling that trailer. They do generate more brake dust than the stock pads, but that is a small price to pay for the added safety they offer."
3,small but pretty,"This charm was smaller than I thought it would be, but is still very pretty. I am giving it to my neice's daughter for her silver charm bracelet."
5,Great deal!,"The scrappbooking paper was shipped and received super quickly! Item received exactly as described. A great value, for a great price!"
5,A Strong Team on Your Side,"I am a colleague of one of the authors, so I've had occasion to discuss and learn about her approach to the legal system, and how dignity can be lost by parties on either side of a divorce. This writing team (each gender is represented) provides a balanced and forthright approach to handling the process of ending a marriage - perhaps without having to enter the legal system at all. A good read not only for people who are facing a divorce, but for people who often support them - family, friends, even social and family workers."
2,Missing the One Song I Needed,"I bought this ""score"" in the hopes that ""What Do We Do? We Fly!"" was in it. There was no way to Look Inside.When it arrived, I looked. The song wasn't there. For products like these, a Look Inside is essential.My definition of ""Score"", is inclusive of all the songs in the show. In this case it is Not True. I returned it."
5,Works as described,"the name brand color cartridge. works great, and ink levels are full. What can you say, it just works like it should."
1,Doesn't work! blue won't print,"The ink did not work properly. Have never had this issue before w/ my printer lexmark x6575, but this time, when i replaced the color cartridge and tried to align the printer, it would not print any blue at all. I tried multiple things including putting in the old cartridge, which printed blue properly, but was low on ink obviously. No stickers were remaining on the cartridge. Not sure what is going on with their ink cartridges that this company is sending out. I cannot return it either as I threw away the box."
4,Ink worked well,Ink worked well but the printer was another story. Driver problems and cheap plastic. Constantly having to reinsatall to get it to print.Did I mention the ink worked well. Will not buy again because the printer broke and was too much of a nuisance to use to fix or by another of this brand.
3,2007 cartridge,"I have yet to install this. I was warned it might be hard to find cartridges for this printer. I was given a 2008 black cartridge with the printer and wanted color for backup. It says 2007 on this box, so I hope when I go to install it, that it will work."
3,Lexmark compared to HP,"I had an HP ""ALL IN ONE"" printer that printed out sharp, deep, rich colors. then I purchased a Lexmark ""ALL IN ONE"" printer. I like all the features which were more extensive than the HP except the photo quality is poor. Washed out looking photos, no matter what I do to correct the picture it still has poor print quality.Using a FUJIFILM FINEPIX S700 which produces a higher quality photo."
3,Sweet old-fashioned storytelling,"October Suite begins with a rich, lyrical tale of two sisters, October and Vergie, who are drawn together and apart by family tragedies. Readers are forced to take sides, but that could change by the end.The characters are quite vivid, and their voices are bold and passionate. Even the voice of the deceased mother is audible. The author's words shape October, her family, friends and colleagues like a potter molds clay. Ms. Clair moves with slow precision as she meticulously unveils the lives of these sisters.October and Vergie grow up and grow apart after October changes her name and her direction. She leaves town to pursue an education and career in teaching. Outside the classroom, October learns lessons about love, family, and friends. This old-fashioned story is sweet and rich. However, the story comes to an unusually abrupt halt - leaving readers wanting more or a 'suiter' ending."
3,A bit s-l-o-w,"Normally, I am a very quick reader and can finish a book in 3-4 days. However, I bought and started this book in September and just finished it yesterday; only after forcing myself to. The basis for the story was good and a bit refreshing from some of the other plots that are prevalent in A/A fiction today. However,the book stalled in some places and too much attention was given to characters that we could have done without. The resolution of the father's whereabouts were a bit too ""storybookish"" and there were a lot of answered questions. Why did Aunts Frances and Maude keep such secrets from Vergie and October? Did James ever find out the truth? I think that the author could have used a few more pages to clarify some of these things instead of leaving us hanging."
3,Enjoyable,"I read to learn and to imagine. This books do let you experience this with every turn of the page. October Brown is the main character in this novel. She is young and naive, but she is patient and sweet. Family is an important part of this book, and sometimes when reading, you feel like the main character should be more stronger especially when it came to her sister and the rest of her family.In order to appreciate this book, you must be open to learning a little history and being open to the opinions of music that is strategicly placed through out. It is a page turner, but not a quick turn. I do recommend this book for reading on a bright day with a glass of iced tea."
5,GREAT READ,"I LOVED this novel and read it in three days! For the literary gurus, there is an incredible use of language, you feel as though you are October Brown herself and are lost in each of her emotions. For everyone else - ditto! I cried each time October cried and spent the entire book guessing what the outcome would be."
4,Add it to your vampire collection,"I believe John Skipp and Craig Spector never quite got the recognition they deserved. ""Light at the End"" was both applauded and dismissed as ""splatter punk"" at the time, but it's a story that has much more merit than that. Yes, the authors paint a harshly realistic picture of what might happen if vampires infested New York -- and it ain't pretty. But there is a richness of characterization in this story that works to balance the gore. I rank this one right under Stephen King's ""Salem's Lot"" as a story that continues to haunt you long after you put the book down."
2,Really Disappointed.,"The jacket is very thin. It is essentially 2 layers of plastice joined together. Ok for light cold. Looks decent. Price is decent. Sizes are bigger. I ordered medium. But it turned out to be large. If I return to Amazon, I have to pay S&H for other goods I bought. so no point."
3,blast from the past,"Something made me think about the old Bobbsey Twins books I read as a kid, so I ordered one for my Kindle. It was fun reminiscing. These books are of course not literary masterpieces, but I enjoyed reading them as a child and it was interesting to revisit this one as an adult."
2,"It might not be ""bad"" but I did not like it","I was fascinated by the topic so I got the book, since it seemed to have some fairly good reviews.I am neither a philosopher nor a physicist, I am an engineer. I did not like this book.I did read all of it, and I think I understood most of it when I didn't fall asleep. I've read my fair share of ""tough"" books, such as most of Dennet's works and all sorts of obscure physics essays. But if a book is tough then it doesn't mean it also is automatically good.This one book simply does not, in my opinion, make a good enough job at speaking to the non-professional-philosopher.I wouldn't recommend it."
3,This book is tough,"Although I know some science and philosophy much better then the normal reader. I had to give up on this book. It is very good. But to finish it, I would need someone to explain it to me."
2,a great disappointment,i rate this as absolutely the worst book i've ever read. i would not recommend it to anybody wanting to learn anything about the philosophy and physics of the arrow of time - in my opinion they would learn much more reading the onion.
2,"Excellent Burner, Crappy Software","After wasting a good deal of time trying to burn quality DVD's with the included Nero software, I decided to use some freeware like DVD43 and DVD Shrink. Ever since I've had flawless performance from this burner. It's very quiet and never seems to overheat, even after hours of continuous use. The quality of the burns is excellent, I backed up a 3 hr Lord of the Rings DVD and can barely tell the difference (using Ridata discs). This is definitely a versatile burner with a good deal of future potential once double layer RW discs become more prevalent on the market."
2,"Pretty, but Pretty Flawed Too","Problems:First: the label on the drive indicates a DRX-710UL, but Windows shows DRU-710A. Even the Flash utility shows DRU-710, and anyone that's flashed a MoBo with the wrong version of firmware understands the need to be precisly accurate when dealing with such things. I finally realized the cause of the confusion (the guts are DRU-710) but because of Sony's laziness and/or incompetence I had to chew up valuable time trying to figure out if a DVD-Writer problem was due to what turned out to be an irrelevant hardware designator.Second, after installing all of the updates (up to and including BYX5) the drive still takes 10 minutes to write a DVD. The media is not the problem: other drives are writing on the same media (ridata 16x) consistently at 16X.The 2 stars are because:1. It seems to reliably burn DVD Data disks, albeit slowly2. It's purtyThere's no excuse for a company the size of Sony to create products with these types of flaws."
1,Buyer Beware,Should have returned this right away. Sony Support is useless. For my PC to recognize there was a DVD drive I had to turn it off and on repeatedly. All of a sudden the DVD capability does not work . CD's do. I would never buy a Sony anything again.
2,Software problem to be aware of,"The machine works wonderfully, looks good; but people should be aware of a small, potent problem with the software. If you have (say) an internal CD-RW drive, and you're running Nero for it, this Sony DVD burner comes with its own version of Nero that wipes out your other version. And, this version of Nero will REFUSE to recognize a non-Sony burner of any sort. So, that's the end of your internal CD-RW drive! I bought this Sony for an office, intending to move it from machine to machine as needed, but this awful feature means I can't use it that way, because I would end up incapacitating everyone's CD burners. So, I have to keep it dedicated to a single machine. Might as well have bought an internal! What a design flaw, in an otherwise wonderful device! Whether or not this issue is of immediate concern to you, you really ought to be aware of it before you buy the machine."
2,"Good drive when it works, but warranty support is AWFUL.","I am on my third drive now, thanks to the first two breaking. Sony sent me the 720UL as a replacement for my 710UL, but it's the same drive with the exception of some faster burn times and the 720UL doesn't support MAC OS.The Sony Service Center in Manning, IA gave me a huge runaround... first they agreed to pay for return shipping on the second defective drive. Then they called me back 2 hours later and refused to pay for the shipping. What a joke.Good drive when it works, but may god have mercy on you if it breaks after the return period."
2,Mac users be aware!,"This product does not work with the software Sony provides (Toast 6 Lite). You need to get Toast 6 Titanium that will cost you another $99. Once you get Toast 6 it works fine, but be careful what type of DVD-R you're using. It works fine with Fuji and Imation dual layer (probably Verbatim as well) but it doesn't recognize Memorex.May 3, 2006 UPDATEIt' doesn't work with cheap Fuji either (pack of 50), so it's not a matter of the company that produce the DVD-Rs, it's rather the quality of the DVDs. Funny thing is that I gave my cheap Memorex and Fuji DVDs to a friend and they work fine on internal burner (Windows)!"
1,Not for use in homes with curious dogs,"We have a very large dog, two medium size ones and three cats. We hoped for an economical pet door that would permit the cats to go outside while keeping the warm air and dogs in. Once the Petsafe door was installed and the cats discovered it, the large dog stuck his head into the opening to find out where his feline friends were. That was the end of the door as a functioning unit and it doesn't seem to be repairable. The little locking mechanism and strip are not on the door anymore and cold air is blowing into the house.I'm sure that this would be an adequate product in a home with cats only, especially for an inside door. In our home, this was a waste of money and will continue to cost us heating dollars until we can replace it with something dog-proof."
2,"Works well as a cat door, but does not lock...","We purchased this cat door about 8 months ago, and are at the point that we need to replace it. It was easy to install (30 minutes max) and our cats are able to go through it easily, but the locking mechanism does not work. Our cats (small females) are able to push right through the door even when it's in the locked position. There are times we would like to keep the cats contained in the basement, but to do so we have to put something in front of the cat door or tape it shut. The last time we did this, one of the cats chewed the magnetic strip right off the door, so now it does not stay closed. Do not purchase this door if you need to lock it from time to time."
2,Poor magnetic lock,"The magnetic device isn't worth a darn. It simply will not operate the device. I even took it off the cat's collar and tried it manually in my hand...it's just doesn't do it.I bought this particular model with the magnetic lock to keep out stray cats, but it's currently held open with clothes pins so my cat can come and go on the porch (there is another cat door in the wall from the porch to the house). Luckily, the neighborhood strays cats have left since the neighbor moved, a neighbor who used to leave food out of any and all cats (once the food was gone the strays moved on to better feeding grounds)."
1,Buyer beware,I purchased this item from my local pet store so I could get it quickly. When I opened the package the item did not operate at all. It had been factory sealed in a plastic bag so ther is no way it could have been tampered with. I decided to pop open the case to see if something on the mechanism had come loose. I was appalled to see that there was a linkage completely missing. I was not impressed with the quality control. I returned it to my pet store and purchased the CAT MATE ELECTROMAGNETIC CAT DOOR for $10 bucks more. It works awesome! It actualy uses a battery-powered electro-magnet switch to open the door. The switch is very sensitive and opens perfectly. Definatley worth a few more bucks.
4,The key to successful number crunching,"As a person in higher education, I have witnessed the common occurence of students needing to use SPSS for their Intro Stats classes, but not knowing how to get started or if they are using the program appropriately. After looking at other manuals to provide this assistance, I really believe that this manual is the best one out there! It has nice algorithmic steps for the application challenged and it provides nice examples to help ensure that you are using the appropriate tests. Since the SPSS program is so user friendly, students may go pal mal through the program and not fully understand what tests they are running and what their output means. I think that this manual provides a nice bridge for this potential gap.The manual is in need of a rewrite however, as the SPSS program has been updated since the books release. I would also liked to see some samples of how to interpret the data output for a couple of the tests."
3,Good for beginners,These Balls are too bouncy and when they bump into each other they go all over the place. Good for beginners. Good for juggling 3-4 balls and maybe 5. But with 5 they're too big and they bump into each other. They're a little bit like tennis balls but larger and squishier. My record for 5 of these balls is 22 catches. But my record for bean bags is 111 catches.
4,Very good but expensive,"Very reliable tape, however in expensive sideIt will last about 6 months as long as you keep the tape clean every week."
3,"Good value, but not the same as original battery","For the money, I believe this battery is a good buy. However, it's working time is less than the one of the original battery."
1,No mention of a proprietary blend,I do not drink caffeine. There was no mention on this website of it containing green tea. Will not purchase again.
5,"Great Pots, Great Book",This book is beautiful. What a shame the show was only a temporary exhibition at the Newark Museum. It has a fabulous variety of work from artists around the globe. Buy it while you still can!
3,Good book but fell apart,My book also fell apart within a day after buying it. Other than that it has great recipes. Not worth the price for falling apart though.
2,Just skip this one,"When you read pages and pages of a book and says nothing.When a book could be written in half pages that it was.When you don't know what to do, if pick the book or watch TV.When you will know the end at the beginning, the book is worthlessI had to work hard on this one and if you suffer while reading a book just don't worth it. I gave this book two stars because my book's qualification is from two to six."
4,4 1/2 Stars -- Never A Dull Moment!,"Criminal attorney Charley Sloan is a very, strong, well-developed character, and Death Penalty has so many interesting goings-on that I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to see what will happen next. My attention was held from the first to last page. Coughlin nicely ties together all of the subplots, although some are somewhat predictable. Nonetheless, Death Penalty is well-worth reading, as are each of the other books featuring Charley Sloan."
4,"A fine blender, but not the great blender I'd hoped for.","When it was time for me to purchase a new blender, I read every review on Amazon. I compared materials, sizes, functions, and motors for all of them. I finally decided that this one would be best.Well, it is a fine blender. It is very attractive and sturdy. The cord wraps around the base and is hidden and out of the way. It also has two nice functions, pulse (speed 5)and a gradual speeding up (speed 4). But I don't see any other advantage over my last blender, which cost $30. I still have to stir during the blending process, and it doesn't blend any faster or more thoroughly."
2,Expect More,Looks and feels cheap. The jar wiggles around in the base. Despite the cost of restocking I returned it.
2,Not bad for the price,I bought this to avoid buing and expensive mandoline to make my sweet potato fries. What I leared is... the sweet potatoes are too hard for this cutter to work well. Neither my husband or I could get the sweet potato to cut. We had to take it out and chop them by hand. It works very good on regular and smaller potatoes though.
1,Not a Good experience - No stars,"I do not even rate this one star, but the website does not go any lower.We used this product only once before we had to throw it in the garbage can. It was not very sturdy and bent after normal use. Would not buy another one."
3,Not bad at all for the price. . .,"Well.I must say that the fries that I prepare are pretty good and do disappear on Poker nights. Still this product isn't bad for the money. If you use the Russet potatoes like me than most of the small ones will be fine. Larger potatoes you'll have to grind down and make sure they are good and wet. Although I have thought I have broken it several times, it still seems to work. All in all a decent product for the price."
1,Very disappointing,I bought this for my husand as a gift and it is awful. It fell apart the first time we used it. It even caught his hand when it fell apart and drew blood. I do not recommend this product at all.
1,FF,"I ordered this item and I never received it. I had to call amazon customer service to get a full refund, but Iwas really disapointed, do not mess with this seller..."
4,Great play phone,This is a great phone and my 11 month old loves it. I only wish it had more than 4 buttons and that the velcro would hold it closed better.
1,A true waste,The coffeemaker has so many problems/ The first coffeemaker I bought leaked water from the tank - Delonghi replaced it with a new maker which doesn't pump water to the coffeepot.... I feel it was true waste of money .
1,Wish I had read these reviews before buying,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I can't believe they are still selling it. I purchased this product in October 2003, it stopped working completely in Jan 2004, I contacted Delonghi and it took them two months to get me a new unit. I received the new product in March 2004 and this unit stopped working in June 2004. When I called Delonghi again, they said they would send me another unit and I would receive it in 4 to 8 weeks. What a waste. Each time I have to return the defective unit and pay shipping and be without a coffeemaker for months at a time. I also agree with all the other reviewers with the poor design elements. You can't pour without dripping coffee, no water level indicator, etc. I wish I had never bought this coffeemaker the first time."
1,Delonghi dual coffee maker,"After replacing the 3rd defective (just stopped working) coffee maker, Delonghi refused to make it good. Stating it was over a year since the original purchase. Yes, that's right 3 coffee makers in one year died. It was a great coffee maker, but not when it wasn't working. We are looking for a replacement, but won't try Delonghi again."
1,My Countertop sees more of the coffee than me,"I wish I had read the first review before purchasing this. It arrived here damaged. Then, when we received the replacement, the fun really began. We spill more of the coffee than what goes into the cup. Obviously a design flaw. Also, there is no delay. You must wait for the cycle to finish before you can pour a cup of coffee. Otherwise, a stream of coffee comes out.There are no fill lines, etc for you to gauge how much you are putting in. It is also very cumbersome to fill as the pots are too close together. For this price, it is not worth it. I am very surprised at Delonghi for having the nerve to put an expensive coffee maker on the market with so many flaws. Wish I could return this. Or better yet, have them recall all and fix the issues."
2,Delonghi DD1000TCB Café Duo Dual Drip Coffeemaker - Spare Parts? What Spare Parts?,"The idea of a coffee maker that brews two separate pots of coffee was very appealing to us, because my wife and I drink different coffee (she is a decaf drinker). It works just as advertised. Inadvertently, I chucked one of the permanent platinum filters in the trash along with the paper filter, not discovering my loss until after the trash was taken away. I called DeLonghi support and they advised that the only spare parts that they carry for the Delonghi DD1000TCB Café Duo Dual Drip Coffeemaker was the carafes. I find that unacceptable."
4,The Golfer's Tee Time Devotional,"The Golfer's Tee Time Devotional was a gift to my husband, andhe liked it so much we decided to get two more for Christmas gifts for my sister and brother-in-laws,who are avid golfers. They are enjoying them alot!"
3,A Mediocre Devotional & Golf Saying Collection,"One can do better for both subjects. The prayers are mostly of the law, as they do not emphasize the gift of Christ and his righteousness for our forgiveness.The golf sayings and stories are the redeemable portion of this. This saying by Robert Trent Jones sums it up: Men build golf courses. God provides the venues."
2,Petit Four cutter,"We were surprised they were so flimsy, since the picture makes them look sturdy. The square shape we ordered was squished out of shape during shipping, disappointing."
5,Map Marie Louise's Journey,"Runaway Marie Louise is an excellent story to use when introducing story mapping to students. The little mongoose travels to several memorable sites with alliterative names and characters, finally ending up at home. Students can map out the story illustrating the boggy, soggy swamp and the squirmy, wormy spot creating an attractive and informative summary of the story."
2,It's ok for beginners,I only bought this book for the 9-ball section and was left a little disappointed. The book is aimed more at begineers so in that respect it is OK. I found that some of the diagrams did not really match the shot suggested and there was one mistake on page 106. That said this book is cheap and if you don't just play 9-ball then it could be worth the investment.
2,"Great idea, terrible graphics.","I got tired of squinting at the tiny black and white diagrams, with the balls numbered in minute type. As these table diagrams are the entire point of the book, this is a fatal flaw."
2,Not for the intermediate player.,This book is about useless to the medium player.. this covers basics and most of the solutions are horrible.. i didnt like it at all.
1,"Good content, impossible to read","Just the sort of book I was looking for, so I was sorely disappointed by the teeny-tiny graphics and lack of cue-ball path-lines. The solids and stripes are designated by number only, there are no stripes on the stripes. And you can barely read the numbers. Diagrams need to be enlarged.If you have time to copy every page to a larger size and draw the paths, then go for it. Probably a great book. As is, it's only usable if you are a prisoner with plenty of time left on your sentence and a powerful magnifying glass."
1,Faulty Touch,It's a good-looking lamp but the touch sensor failed to operate consistently and it was therefore useless. It required multiple slaps in multiple locations to make it do something which was maddeningly frustrating.
1,Just okay...,"It's a nice enough lamp. Fits nicely onto a small table. I don't like that the shade doesn't come up a bit higher to cover the light bulb better (update - my bad, I flipped the shade and it was fine). When delivered, was missing the piece that screws the lamp shade down. For the price, I would expect all the pieces to be there. I think you could do just as well, if not better (for the price) at a local Ross, Tuesday Morning, or Marshall's. Prob. won't return it just because of the hassle. Just okay - don't get your hopes up too high.UPDATE: I've downgraded my orig. 3 stars to one because after one day of use, it no longer works - I put the light on, and it just pops off. Used it one day, and already defective. It's going back today. Don't waste your time with this one!"
3,Minimal Tracks And No Background Details At All,"This and the companion Volume 1, which were issued in 1998 by Sony Music Special Editions, are typical of the releases by the major distributors back then: minimal tracks (just 10 here) and absolutely nothing in the way of liner notes or discography. All, however, are original renditions and the sound quality is excellent.In addition there are a few tracks that are not that easy to find in compilations, even today, although in that regard that applies less to this second volume which contains material generally available on multi-track compilations. It also has one (To Think You've Chosen Me) which was not a hit for Sammy Kaye. The 1950 hit version belonged to Eddy Howard & His Orchestra.One cut you may not find in too many other places, with this quality of sound, is Memories Of You by The Four Coins, a # 22 in late 1955 and a song featured in the film The Benny Goodman Story. The backing orchestra is that of Don Costa."
5,Wow! Amazingly uplifting and easy to read. I am revived!,"I picked this book up by chance, randomly opened it and began to read and just could not put it down. Anytime I encounter a problem now instead of thinking the worst like I used to I realize that God is up to something great! I have had many hurts and betrayals in my life and this book helped me to understand these events from the proper perspective. I have already seen more victories in my life because of this new perspective and I am certain more will come. Mr. Evans, I will seek out more of your books in the future. God really has used you mightily through this work. Thank you!"
5,The Perfect Peanut Butter Cookie!,"This cookie reminds me of one of those girl scout cookies, but without all the nasty stuff! This is the perfect companion to a cup of hot tea! Perfectly baked, not too sweet, and seriously addictive! I had a box in the pantry, and my daughter, son-in-law, & husband finished them off in 2 days!Warning: this is not a health food. At 130 calories & 5g fat for 2 cookies, you won't want to sit with the unopened box because you WILL want more than just 2! So just take out 1 or 2 cookies, seal up the box, & savor the yumminess!"
1,Horrible,"They arrived today with the intent that I would give these to my 1 year old son. They taste like ruined, burnt sticks of what were meant to be graham sticks. They are packed with Salt. This is not 'Back to Nature'. This should go back to the factory it was dredged out of. I would not buy again under any circumstance, and I will now avoid this brand passionately. Be warned."
3,changed more than the packaging,"they changed their packaging and stuff in the last year and it appears they've tweaked the recipe as well. They used to be sweeter, very cardboard like now. Great for small kids who don't know any better but I cannot imagine anyone older than 12 willingly choking these down. Texture and flavor not what it once was."
1,Burnt Cookies!,I have ordered these cookies numerous times. This last order though was horrible. The cookies were all burnt little crisps. I wrote to the company about this issue and got no response. Won't be ordering these again. Buy at your own risk.
4,tasty tiny cookies,these cookies a tiny but tasty treasures. not very many to a package but a good size for lunches.at 24 per lot these are an okay value
3,"Not like Oatmeal, but tasty none-the-less","I was disappointed at first, these taste nothing like Oatmeal cookies. You'll be disappointed, too, if you buy them looking for a yummy Oatmeal cookie, they taste more like ""Ranger"" cookies (e.g. Krogers). They do taste good and make a fine snack, but they should have called them something else, as I'm sure many will be disappointed.Still, now that I know what they taste like, I might buy them again if they go on sale."
2,Didn't really enjoy them,"After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to order this for my son's lunch brown bag. I found it taste a little stale, just not the fresh taste like you know when you are eating a good chocolate chip cookie and you are so ""happy"". OK, that was not one of that moments in my life. I tried really hard to enjoy them because I paid for a higher price for this, but every time I ate this, I just like - wish I didn't order this. I was hoping my hubby would like them since he has a sweet tooth and he'll have to finish those for me. He didn't like it either. Now my son (2 and half yr old) - the only person I bought this cookie for, who also likes sweets like his father, sorry to report - he does not like it either. He took a bite and dumped the whole bag and said he doesn't want them any more. What a bummer!"
3,Peanut Butter Cookies,These cookies were delivered on time and the package was as described.We usually buy these cookies from a discount warehouse store but they ran out. The package from the discounter is slightly different from the Amazon.com supplier but the cookies are the same. After totaling the price and shipping we found that it costs less to purchase from the warehouse store when they have them. It is more expensive to buy these cookies on-line than to buy them in the store. Nevertheless my son enjoys the cookies and we are satisfied.
3,Breaking the Constraints to World Class Performance,The book contains good overview information and good sample cases. The sample for future CRT sections seem to disconnect from the current CRT. This is very strange. Overall is good.
3,"Good, but could of been better....","Yo, after hearing this boy blow in the ""State2state"" soundtrack and movie i was looking forward to this joint. But when i got it, it just didnt give me that buzz that I felt on state2state. It was good, there was about 3 really good songs and 2 ok and the rest i had to fast forward. Dont get me wrong. I love T-nutty and the nutt factorzz and been bumping them lately. I still bought it for my collection though dog. peace."
5,This is probably the best action movie I've seen in months,"A friend of mine had a copy of it. I loved this movie. It's so good. This movie should have gone to theaters. It would've made a load of money. Besides the fact that it's a Dolph Lundgren movie, the plot is really really good. I also liked the fact that Jerry Springer plays the president in this movie. That's so perfect! He totally pulls it off."
3,Sinks under its own weight,"This film contains the action scenes we expect from such a vehicle, but the writers for some reason decided to tie these scenes to a plot so complex, and (for me) unlikely, that it comes to resemble a comedy of some kind. Layer upon layer of double-crossing and false identities are revealed between burts of automatic gunfire until the viewer, who has settled into his easy chair with his bag of popcorn, expecting to enjoy a typical Lundgren bloodbath, is badly confused and shaking his head. They tried to do far too much.I think the complex plot also causes several large plotholes. For instance, just who are these innumerable masked attackers, and how did so many appear in Romania? And how could this massive gun battle rage for hours outside Bucharest without somebody (e.g., the police) noticing it? (The Romanian Army doesn't show up for ages)."
5,grab some popcorn,"...and check this movie out immediately. I've been a long time lundgren fan but for some reason i was a bit skeptical of this movie. For one its lundgrens directorial debut and second (i laugh still) its starring the great jerry springer. Hmmmm, but i decided to order it anyways, and i must say i was impressed just watching the opening credits. It seemed like it had a hollywood blockbuster budget, but i can only credit lundgren for how he got the effects. Anyways the action is fast and catches you off guard most of the time. Best scene is when they are navagating the sewers beneath the hotel and are ambushed by some baddies. life long lundgren fans should definately not miss this one."
4,Better than expected.,"Jerry Springer is the president. Drago from Rocky IV is the star and director. I must say it sounded intriguing from the start, but it actually was a pretty good movie. It reminded me of the old 80s action movies and I am a sucker for those, so I actually enjoyed this movie. In my opinion, it is definitely worth checking out."
3,Power Charms = Mega Lame,"I know, I know...""what do want for [this amount of money]?"" But Sheesh, this is the biggest piece of [garbage] I've seen in a long time. Please don't make the same mistake I did."
3,Good,Me and my friends enjoyed making braclets.The only thing is is that you run out of bands fast.But i still have alot of beads left.
1,ok camera-WARNING Pentax is a horrible company,Bought this camera to take pics of my new son. Had the camera a couple of days and the lens stopped retracting. Sent it in (under warranty of course). Pentax told me it wasn't working because it got wet. The camera was never even near water and was always in the case when not used (for about 3 days). I was taking a photo of my sleeping husband and son when it happened. I did some research and found numerous other people who complained that Pentax did the same thing to them. They lie so that it is not covered under warranty and you have to pay the couple of hundred dollars to get your camera back! Very poor way to do business. Would NEVER buy from them again.
2,Poor Camera,"Very poor quality pictures that look as if the focus doesn't remain constant, with people standing in a group! I have sent them back for a refund. Veryt dissatisfied.Johnny Smith"
1,Movie mode is a distaster,Don't buy this camera unless you want to see a DIVX logo in the bottom right hand of every video you shoot! Unbelievable! Everything else about this camera is good except the small buttons and the stupid DIVX bug.
2,The Optio S4 was MUCH better...,"I have both an Optio S4 & an Optio S6. I spend most of my time out at night. Concerts, clubs, raves, etc. The Optio S4 took AMAZING low light & night setting photos. The Optio S6 fails miserably at them. Even in situations where all stage lights are on and the room is well lit, you must repeatedly hit the button to even get it to try and take a picture and half the time the photos come out blurry.I must say, however, in daylight & very well lit scenarios it does take great pictures. But it does not suit my nightlife purposes."
3,What is up with the video noise?,"First off, the pictures are stellar. I am an amateur user with a critical eye. This camera shoots awesome pics. No question. I researched different cameras and read as much as I could. I did read about the video noise problem with this one...some people had it, some didn't. I went with the benefit of the doubt and got the camera. Lo and behold, damn it. It does have a serious noise problem during video. I know, people have separate dv cameras for shooting video. So do I, but I don't have it with me at all times. I love being able to shoot impromptu videos. Alas, I am returning this camera because of this noise problem. And no, it is NOT caused by a finger over the microphone. Guaranteed. I want to love this camera. I would love it to work. If anyone could give me advice as to how to fix this problem, I would forever be in their debt. But for now, I have to let it go. Anyone have a good alternative?"
4,Great little camera!,"I typically shoot with professional level SLRs. I wanted something small for vacations and just to carry around. This little thing is great! Great images. More control than most cameras this size.Only 4 stars because it could be a tad bit more on the customizable side. Id like to see an apreture priority or hey... full manual would be nice.But, this is not the audience Canon was trying to target.Great lil' camera!!"
5,Great Camera,"Fast startup, easy to use and good price for features. Highly recommend over many other cameras."
5,Exceeds all expectation,"This is a great, small - key! - camera, bought to replace previous larger digitals which were bulky and often lost. We went for something small in order to be able to keep it in a pocket. The fact that the Elph takes *great* pictures was almost a bonus, but it does - a wide range of lighting conditions, zoom settings, and so on, even when the LCD screen can't give a decent picture at max zoom. The controls are intuitive, the lag-time between shots is almost zero (although the UltraII card I stuck in it may help here also?), and the autofocus etc. very effective, as is the image stabilisation.I'd definitely replace this one if it were to go missing... hope not :)."
4,Loved it so much... bought it twice!,"I previously had the SD600 and the lcd went bad within 6 months of buying it. The SD600 was a bit slow and the quality was not as good as the SD700. I bought the SD700 after hours of looking around on line and looking at reviews. I loved it! That is until my son dropped it and cracked the lens a few weeks after I bought it. I again researched and decided on the SD750. I did not like it at all (except the big screen). I did not like where the dials were moved and the pictures just were not as good as the 700. Maybe it was because of the image stablizer (or maybe it was me??). I really don't know what all the hype is about the 750. I packaged it up the next day and returned it. The 700 was more expensive, but well worth it."
5,Canon PowerShot SD700 Digital Camera,Great shots. Great size. Especially great shots in low light. Does everything promised.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!,"The LCD screen is very, very fragile. Mine broke after a couple of months of use. The repair will set you back about 135 bucks, so figure that into your purchase price."
1,Better not let it slip!!,"I had this camera for less than 2 months, when it slipped out of my hand and fell about 2 feet to a carpeted floor. The lens became stuck out, and I couldn't turn it on anymore. I sent the camera back to Canon, and even though IT IS still covered by warranty, they want to charge me $138.19 to fix it!!! It's obviously a very fragile camera. It breaks INCREDIBLY easily, and they are not willing to fix it for less than 1/3 of what you would pay to buy it brand new. Very disappointing!!"
1,No Image stabilization,"That person( Rae (Honolulu, HI United States) ) who put the picture of moving cars, forgot to mention about the truck next to it, it is so hazy and is worthless, cannon is making crapy camera's, i cannot get a clear shot of anything moving, everything is hazy. Image Stabilized is a joke by canon. And what the hell is 4x Image Stabilized Zoom and wats the differnece between just Image Stabilized."
4,canon sd700 is,"I previously owned a canon elph sd300. it wassmaller and lighter and easier to fit in mypocket, but when shooting in low light andwhen shooting landscapes the fine details wereoften blurry. The sd700is is a little largerand heavier, but it still fits in my largerpockets and in the same carrying case. Theimage stabilization works well in low light andwhen shooting landscapes. It is an excellentupgrade to the elph line. I give 4 stars andnot 5 because I would have preferred the smallerform factor of my previous elph, but with the IStechnology included. That would have been perfect.one other note: I accidentally dropped my new sd700from about three feet onto a very solid concrete floorand the camera has worked perfectly ever since. seemslike a solid product."
5,Worth upgrading.,My wife had a Canon S400 for about 2 years and this one was worth upgrading to from that one. The LCD is AWESOME. The low light capability is AWESOME.
3,"Great pictures, terrible audio quality in videos","The picture quality of this camera is excellent. I have to question reviews that I've read on the net, wondering if they actually used the camera, or just chose to summarize the product literature. When taking videos, the sound quality is terrible. There is a sizzling sound that is always present. I have tried taking clips indoors and outdoors. With IS turned on or turned off. In a nearly silent setting, or with music playing. In all cases, the sizzling sound and scratchyness was present. For comparison, I recently took a few video clips with an SD550 at a wedding. The audio did not have any of these problems with that camera."
5,Great traveling companion,"I wanted this to replace a 3-year-old Minolta, I needed it very small and I wanted good picture quality. I was particularly frustrated by the very slow shutter speed on the previous camera. This one is great for my use, takes perfect pictures of traveling and babies, the shutter speed is very fast -- feels almost instantaneous -- and the picture quality is excellent.In addition, I dropped this on the floor from chest high and the shutter mechanics broke. Canon gave me good repair services, it took about a week, and cost $147."
2,Flash Troubles,"I get these small weird little hazy circles on images when I use the flash. I used to think it was the flash reflecting off dust or something creating this, but it happens in just all of my low light picturess. Does anyone else have this problem?"
4,canon digital camera,"I bought this camera for my mom because of the ""IS"" feature. I've used it and we both love it. I have the SD600 which I love as well. My only complaint is you can't use the time date stamp in all picture modes."
3,"I was very excited, now a little disappointed...","I have had my camera for 2 months. I loved it at first, but now I am finding it disappointing because of all my pictures that have red eye. The flash is not the greatest and it causes a lot of red eye in my photos. I dont know if I am doing something wrong. I keep trying to find a way to fix the red eye with its various features, but it doesn't seem to be working. Its a great camera because of the rechargable battery and compactness. It is a heavy camera, which I wasn't expecting, but it is a still a good camera if you like the solid weight feel."
1,Spots on Pictures,"I bought this camera in Sept. 2006, as well as, an underwater housing for the camera. From the start, many of the pictures had round whitish spots on them, whether the pictures were taken on land or underwater. I've followed Canon's suggestions below and my pictures still end up with spots. Not only have I invested in the camera but the underwater housing. I will not buy another Canon camera for this reason.This is Canon's answer to spots that appear on the pictures. ""This may occur depending on the shooting conditions, but is not a malfunction. To prevent this phenomenon, please follow these steps.- Lighten the area as much as possible and shoot without using the flash.- Avoid shooting in dusty areas."""
1,"Disappointed, Defective Failed camera","Camera delivered today after appx 25 photos lens failed to retract. Screen displays ""lens Error restart camera"". I read manual, used fully charged battery to no avail. Paid 399 for camera and bought 2gb memory card by sandisk for 45.00. Never got to see picture quality as camera lasted about one hour before failing. I am an experienced user of digital cameras."
5,Fast little camera,"I chose this model for it's shutter speed and have not been disappointed. It is fast, the resolution and sharpness are good and the image stabilization feature is very handy. I take many snaps of kids and pets and other candid shots and I have been very happy."
2,VIDEO NOISE PROBLEM!!!,"After trying TWO separate SD700's, I am returning them both. The SD700 has a serious micrphone problem: the overall volume is extremely low, and there is a pronounced hissing noise that dominates the video. This happens at all settings. I have owned other Canon digitals, both large and small and have not had this problem. The primary reason I bought this model was for the image stabilizer, which I found does not really make enough difference to be worth the price. My ""old"" Powershot SD200 takes better photos and video. FYI, I emailed Canon's service/repair/warranty department about this issue over a month ago, just to see if there was anything that could be done about the video problem and they ignored me. Fortunately I am not dependent on them for help and can just return my camera to the place I bought it. Rethinking my brand loyalty..."
4,Great Camera with prob,I love this camera --that is everything except the high pitch whine that starts when it is turned on and won't stop until the lens is zoomed. Canon is not aware of prob. but 3 diff cameras at Best Buy did the same thing. I hope they can correct this as this camera is very good otherwise. Fast and solid construction and good looks. After zooming lens you can still hear a low level static if you put it up to your ear. Sounds like motor is still running.
5,Superb,I am totally amazed at this camera's capabilities!!! The image stabilization is fantastic and the screen quality is unsurpassed. I love it.
4,Handy; great results,"If I wouldn't also own a Canon PowerShot S3, I would think this camera is perfect. The S3 has 12x zoom and terrific video sound. This SD700 just doesn't zoom or sound as good as the S3, BUT it's a lot less money and so much handier! When I offended Art Garfunkel on stage with the S3 flash, I knew I had to get a less powerful model. The SD700 fits the bill!"
5,Best compact camera I have ever seen.,"After falling asleep with my SD400 in my pocket and crushing the screen I needed a new camera. I had found the SD400 to work very well and take great picture, but the features felt slightly unrefined compared to some of the larger cameras I have used.The SD700 is the perfect compact camera, it does not have these problems. It crams enormous image size and quality, image stabalization and refined controls into a tiny body (slightly larger then the SD400).The menues and interface feel like using a Mac! Simple large icons which animated by getting larger as you scroll across them.I am just blown away by this camera.Oh it does make noises when you move the zoom, it sucks. The video are not the best but I didn't buy it shot video."
3,Good Camera- But weak flash and Red Eye a big problem,"Design is very slick and looks professional. Very pocketable..When you click photos and look at it through the high contrast LCD on the back the pictures it look wonderful. You will tend to fall in love with the camere because of that..Great to have IS on a small camera,However to me there 2 important photographic features that was a deal breaker:1) Week Flash : Pictures look like standing in front of a cave..2) Red Eye: While expected of small camera, the cannons and especially this one is very prone to red eye.. Anytime subject is not looking at the camera lens directly you will get red eye and not always easy to fix with software without spending a lot of time..So if you are not into shooting indoor or people photos this is for you..Otherwise I recommend to take a look at the fuji f30 or f31fd.."
4,Canon SD700,"Camera is great but no camera is perfect.I have been waiting for 2 months for this camera, and for the most part it was worth the wait.A few things that irritated me the most compared to my previous Sony camera were :a) resolution of the screen (not of actual photo, those were great)b) the battery/memory compartment squeeks a lotc) noise of the zoomd) cheap plastic dial.Overall I give it 4 out of 5 but I am not sure it is worth the high price....I will keep mine though"
2,Blurry Pictures,"I had an SD550 that I was very happy with, but broke the LCD. I ordered the SD700 as a replacement and was very excited about the 4x zoom. I have to say that I was very disappointed in the picture quality in this camera. No matter what setting I used (auto, manual, scenes, flash/no flash, etc.), most pictures came out blurry. Even the ones that weren't blurry, we not crisp. The camera also produced much, much darker videos than my SD550, depsite using the same lighting scenarios. I use my camera mostly to take pictures of my toddler and outdoor nature scenes. My daughter's face in almost every picture was blurry, even though the camera was focusing on her face. I returned it and am going to try the SD900 - hopefully that will be better."
4,"Nice camera, but listen to the zoom before you buy...","I really love a lot of things about this camera. ThePROS:Image is the usual canon quality.Like the new iso 800 and image stabilization.Cons:My videos are marred by this whirring sound .... I sure hope they fix this, its quite annoying. Maybe I should have gotten the SD630?"
4,Canon SD 700,"A fine camera. The controls are improved over previous, less powerful models. It fits in my pocket and is ready in seconds for a sudden photo-op. A visible gauge that indicates battery life would be helpful rather than the sudden ""out of gas"" indicator. Otherwise I am pleased with the camera and would get another Canon when I need one."
5,Excellent digital camera,I did a bit of research before choosing this camera and I must say that the recipient(it was a gift) is extremely pleased with its features and the multitude of options as well as it's quality.
5,I'm leaving my 12mp DSLR at home...,"..and keeping this little wonder with me at all times. What a benefit to have such a great camera around when you want it. So instant and portable, I take ten times as many shots now, because it's not a project dragging out the equipment.Love it!Jim Cooper"
4,Very convenient,"Ok...I am not very tech savvy when it comes to photography. I was just looking for an ""aim and shoot"", easy to use kinda camera. I have had this for abt 4 months now and so far it's working great. Easily fits directly into my pocket, battery lasts pretty good, pictures look great and whats more it looks sleek. I am very happy with this buy so far and would definitely recommend this to folks that want a simple camera (I haven't even bothered to check out all the features). My ""Digital SLR type"" friends will probably laff at this review :)"
5,Excellent devotionals on the Psalms,I've been learning some unique things. Very good book. Authors did a fantastic job. One or two pages for each day.
4,Terrific Book - NLT translation,"I love the layout of this book. The Psalm text is on the left-hand side of the page with a devotional, a small word study and quotation on the right side. Nice paper quality. Big, readable font. The NLT is an easy-to-read translation but some of the psalms that I was familiar with seemed less ""rich"" in the NLT with many of the words we've come to know changed to a (for lack of a better word) simple word. For deep study, this isn't the book you want but as a devotional or light study, it's a terrific book."
5,The One Year Book of Psalms,I have purchased this book for the last 5 years as gifts. Some of the people I have given it to have not read the bible at all or only when they were young. I also use it in my grief share sessions. The stories that are written to explain the psalm are so interesting and informative.
3,Poor re-release,"I got this guide after having purchased the original guide and used it to great effect with the original game. Unfortunately, this guide isn't as much of a re-write as it is a re-release. There are a number of details missing and a number of errors made in the weapons and armor section (no mention of the Sword of Aeons only doing 240 damage in the book). Overall, the book is still pretty good, but nowhere near as accurate as the original was to the original game. Buy it if you're having trouble doing the easy, tedious tasks (finding keys and getting through demon doors) but don't expect a whole lot of accuracy or detail in the newer sections."
3,Not So Universal After All,"We bought the canoe kit to work with our existing luggage rack on our Jeep Laredo but the foam blocks were not tall enough to work. We kept the kit though as the tie downs are of good quality, figuring we could use the foam blocks another time on a car with no racks. I would recommend measuring the blocks against what you have before relying on the name ""Universal""."
3,Good to have for some that doesn't know how to blow a call but needs to make a quack noise,Real easy to blow great for a buddy if he wants to in participate early season duck hunting. Not a bad quack either.
4,Pretty Cool,"I enjoy having it when there are people that cannot call very well because it makes good noise and easy to blow. Also it is not Wooden, Black like it looks in the picture it is see-through Plastic. It does come apart."
5,This call is easy to use,"Before you read too much of this, you should know that I'm not an experienced duck hunter. I can't authoritatively verify the quality of the sounds this call makes. That aside, it is a very easy call to make sounds with and does take a bit of abuse. My nephew loves to play with this call and blow it as hard as his lungs will let him. The best sounds, however, come from more gentle blowing and a large variety of duck sounds are available with simple variations of technique. To my inexperienced ears it sounds like the sounds ducks make. The price is hard to go wrong with. If you've got some of those very expensive calls, maybe their nicer but this would be a good back-up."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTE BUST OF A BUY, I REALLY LIKE PRIMO, HOWEVER THIS ONE SOUNDS LIKE A DYING MOOSE. NOT IMPRESSED AND NOT EVER GOING TO BY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.SO DISSAPOINTED! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY..."
3,For the price nice to have,"Better than not having one but probably should of spent a little more for a much better one. I would suggest upgrading to a better call, because it's the second most important item"
4,great for the money,the call is great for the money. i bought it because i wanted to start duck hunting. if you are looking for a cheap duck call that works good this is the call for you.
5,Sounds realistic,"This works pretty good, easy to use and you can make many different sounds with it. I live on a lake and wanted to call some ducks, what did I get? A bunch of geese. I would recommend this product though."
5,I've got to get the others!,Home Improvement has always been a big favorite. Sometimes you watch a favorite and put it away. With Home Improvement I continue laughing. The cast is great and the humor is clean. I love all the personalites and it's great seeing the little ones growing up.
5,LOVE THIS SHOW,"FINALLY! This is ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" without the hatred and anger. Sure the family rags on each other a bit, but you can still feel the respect and love... sadly missing in most ""Raymond"" episodes. And it was a darn funny show. Hurry up with all the rest of the seasons!"
3,Home Improvement - The Complete First Season by Tim Allen,Relaxing family comedy with each episode carrying a message which is generally conveyed by the character Wilson.
5,My Favorite Show,"It's about time they came out with Season 1 on DVD. I have been wondering about this for quite some time now, and every time I see a TV show come out on DVD, even the older ones, such as I Love Lucy. I have all the episodes recorded on VHS. Now I can have them on DVD and throw away the tapes! I am sooooo excited! I can't wait until Christmas! I want it now! I could watch these episodes over and over again. They have happy, sad, and funny moments, which is why this show is the best show ever. It is better than the new ones that have just premiered and the ones that will be coming out in the future. I urge you to buy this DVD. It is worth your money! I have seen every episode, obviously since I have all of them on tape. It will be worth it to watch them on DVD, especially since it will have a clear crisp picture. This item will be #1 on my Christmas list, well, it is now! I know for sure I will be buying the rest of the series as soon as they come out and I suggest you do the same!"
2,Rent it,"This is a decent show, but I'd suggest renting it first, then deciding if it's worth spending the money on it.Sure the eps are funny, but how many times can you rewatch them?With shows like Friends, Mad about You, and Everybody Loves Raymond, I can watch the same ep over and over and still be laughing.With Home Improvement, one viewing of an ep, is plenty for me.I do plan to rent it, when it comes out, because I'd like to see most of the eps,and the special features at least once, but I won't be buying it."
2,How stupider can Tim Allen get!,These shows were not funny;They were stupid..Why waste your time on watching an dumb show like Home Improvement when you can be watching the Fresh Prince a much cooler show 4 real!
3,Thin,"The product has great color and design, but upon taking the comforter and sheets out of the package it is easy to see how thin the material is. The thread count is very low and the material is almost see-through when held up or against a light colored background.I will keep it for the sake of my 4 year-old's excitement and use, but I am also curious as to how long the material will last from use and washes over time."
4,Be Aware!,"I like this pillow case, but the picture online made me think I was buying a bed spread. Be aware, it is only a pillow case! It is royal blue with baby blue STAR WARS all over the fabric. Cotton. Fits a plush twin pillow well."
2,It's great when it works,"We had Delonghi BCO264B combination for over a year. Last week, once of a sudden, the drip coffee part simply stopped working. No warning, no signs..However, when it worked it was good. We're looking for a different combination machine now, but it most probably won't be another DeLonghi product."
1,Works great....then it just dies.,"I'm thoroughly bummed with this product. For Christmas of 2008 my husband ordered me a similar Delonghi coffee maker from Macys. When it got it and went to put it together a piece was missing. I finally got through to the company and they said that it would be over a month before they could ship the part. We decided to return that coffee maker to the store and ordered a Cafe Nero from Amazon. I thought ""What a great all-in-one machine!"" I was completely happy with it until last Friday when it went belly-up. I had turned it on, went to get up the kids, and came back to find that there were only a couple of drops of coffee in the carafe and the thing had just died. It's very disappointing...I really enjoyed it while we had it, but thats too much money to pay for a coffee machine that I'm not even going to have for 2 years. We ended up going back to a Mr. Coffee. It's not near the machine, but it's not near the price either."
1,not worth it,I had been looking for a combo coffee and espresso machine for my boyfriend's birthday. I had done some cursory research and knew of delonghi. when I saw this machine on Amazon for over half WITH free shipping I jumped at the offer. it seemed too good to be true. it was. although the espresso side took a bit too long in my opinion (30 min) it worked well. the coffee side? didn't even turn on. such a disappointment. I tried everything I knee to get it to work but in the end it just wasn't worth the efott of trying to get the company to fix it on my penny and I returned it. lesson learned.
2,Not really what I've expected,I did not have much time to know if this machine is good or not due to a problem I had with the seller. I had to return the machine 3 or 4 days after I received it but the little time I had I was not that impressed... The espresso filter is too hard to attach. You have to be strong to be able to tie the espresso filter to the espresso filter holder on the right position. I also noticed that the espresso does not come out as hot as I've expected. If you like a good espresso I would not recommend this machine.
1,this item sucked!,Matthew is a con artist! The product is defective and a complete rip - off!!! Dont' waste your hard earned MONEY!
4,Generally works well but requires practice,"Overall, we're satisfied with this product. The regular coffeemaker is easy to use. I particularly like the fact that the water reservoirs can be removed and filled right from the tap. Even if there's residual water, it doesn't leak out the bottom if you pull the tank out of the coffeemaker. And we like that the coffee grounds holder swings out away from the machine, making it easy to fill. The steamer works fine; I turn it on first thing in the AM and it's always ready to go no more than 10 minutes later. Our only challenge is the espresso maker. We still haven't figured out the technique for making an espresso that's not too strong or too weak. We'll keep practicing; in the meantime, we're just adding foamed milk to our regular coffee, which satisfies the need."
1,Lasted 3 days,"Made 3 or 4 pots, then the drip coffee side died. No power to the clock or the buttons that operate it. Called DeLonghi, was told it's an electrical fault that can't be repaired by the consumer, so I had to send it in for repair, at my cost. Luckily I'm still within the Amazon return period, so it's going back to them for a refund. Definitely not interested in a replacement. I had read the other negative reviews here, but assumed they were from heavy users. I make 1 or 2 pots of drip coffee a day on weekends and that's about it, so figured I'd be okay. Obviously this is not a over-use problem. Been happy with other DeLonghi products I've owned in the past, but this one definitely has some quality control issues."
1,Randomly stops working,"I've had this product about a year and a half. Three months after I bought it, the drip coffee maker stopped working one morning. I sent it back to DeLonghi and after five weeks they shipped it back to me, repaired. I continued to use it daily and just this morning, once again the drip coffee maker has ceased to function. Also in the past few months, the espresso maker has been taking longer and longer to prep and make espresso, and the froth. I had a fifteen dollar Mr. Coffee cheap drip coffee maker that ran solid like a champ for about four years... All in all, not worth the money in my book - too much hassle and not a reliable product."
1,not good,"After opening this product I found some of the pieces were missing,so I contacted the seller and maker to get the parts.After 6 weeks I finally get the parts and was able to start using the machine,this was a christmas gift that I had given.After waiting for parts to arrive I found the machine did not work good at all.We tried it several times and we ended up with more coffee on the outside of the machine than in the cup.That was 2 years ago and the machine has been sitting on the shelf since.We took our 15 year old espresso make back off the shelf and have been using it since."
3,short lived brewing,"I am an avid coffee drinker, somewhere between 2-4 pots a day. My husband bought this 3-in-1 coffee maker for me for the Christmas of 2004. It has a digital clock/timer, flavor strength switch and makes pretty good coffee. It worked great for a while.However, after about a year and a half the coffee maker side stopped working, without any warning. I went to get a cup of coffee and the hotplate was cold. After emptying it, cleaning it out and setting it up again, I turned it back on to make another pot.The hotplate didn't even get warm, and the brewer didn't even make a noise or pull a single drop into the carafe. Even though the espresso and steamer side still works wonders, for the price of this 3-in-1, you would think it would work a bit longer than it has."
2,there are better ones out there,"I thought I did enough research before buying this machine but apparently not enough. I was disappointed in 1. the design ( looks rather cheap) and 2. the performance. The coffee maker didn't stop dripping either water or coffee when you pulled out the pot and for the espresso part you need to REHEAT the unit 30 MINUTES prior to use!!! So much about being flexible about having an espresso! If you really enjoy good coffee you need to invest more, unfortunately."
2,Coffee freak,"We love coffee, and living in Europe for 11 years I really enjoy espresso.Finding this machine after searching for about 6 months and reading all the reviews I could find I figured it would be great for our coffee/espresso needs.For the first 6 months it proved to be a great choice. Then the boiler started taking longer and longer to heat up, until we would have to turn on the boiler 1 hour before making espresso! Not my idea having espresso ""anytime I want.""Just days after the warranty expired the coffeemaker stopped working all together. No warning, it just stopped.The only reason I gave this review a 2 star and rating is because the first six months. It worked great."
2,Coffee maker FAIL!,The button on it sticks and the filter screen is coming loose also it leaks. Ran good for one year.
5,Love this machine,"I have had this machine for about three years and never had problem with it. I do have to make a disclaimer though, this machine is not for people who are novice to coffee making and maintenance. I worked in the industry for years so I know a bit about what it takes for a good cup and this machine does the trick. If you have had problems with this machine chances are you are not cleaning the machine properly or are a bit novice in coffee making.There are a few quirks with it but overall a good bang for your buck. If your looking for fancy lattes and such and have no experience or nohow I would advise in a fully automated machine."
2,Bad Quality Product,"I bought your product in the beginning of the year. I use this product once a day, and unfortunately it stopped working. I'm really disappointed about this because the last Delonghi product I had lasted me 10 years."
4,Volume #3: There's No place Like Jungle: 30 minutes in EP mode !,"I would have given this tape 5 stars had it been recorded in SP mode and had more than 30 minutes of cartoons on it!The few cartoons are:1) (George of the Jungle) THE TREASURE OF THE SARAH MADRE - There's gold in them thar trees, and George has the map and two greedy crooks following.2) (Super Chicken) THE EASTER BUNNY - The Easter Bunny has started robbing banks.3) (Tom Slick) THE IRISH CHEAPSTAKES - Tom competes with low-down rival Baron Otto Matic for a plastic trophy.4) (Suoer Chicken) SALVADOR RAG DOLLY - The Birthday Bandit continues to plunder parties."
1,pass this book bye,this book is way out of date. There are far better publications available. Don't waste your money. Look elsewhere for up to date material.
1,won't work for KRZR,"ordered a battery for my KRZR, and after a lengthy wait got what looked to be a brand new battery. only problem, it was the wrong one...it wouldnt fit the phone. contacted seller, got an apology and was told the battery i needed was on back-order, and would be shipped out in a week or so. 10 days later, i received it, and it was the exact same battery they had sent out to me the first time (wrong one)! contacted the seller, and was told they could no longer get the right battery for my phone, so they issued a refund."
2,old product (production date),I purchased this cell phone battery for my K-Rzr with every expectation of receiving quality merchandise from Amazon. The product which was delivered to me in March 2010 was dated as produced in December 2007. Hopefully they will honor the one year warranty if it doesn't work as expected as it came in the Motorola packaging. At this time I am disappointed.
5,Good,Product is as advertised. I got it quickly and it restored my phone's battery life to what it was when I first bought it.
2,Motorola Battery Li-Ion CDMA,"This product really did not improve battery life as advertised. I can sometimes get 2 days out of it. I don't talk a lot on the phone, so I really expected more battery life for just sitting idle most of the time."
3,A bit out of date,"I'm holding onto my older cell phone (Krazer) since it is reliable and fits so nicely in my pants pocket. Old battery needed replacement, and the one I ordered from Amazon was exactly the correct type, but it was several years old. It doesn't seem to hold a charge quite as long as the original I had in the phone (thinking a few years back). But the price I paid vs. Verizon still makes it worthwhile."
1,Does not fit my KRZR,I have a KRZR and this battery is too big for my phone. I now see my KRZR uses a different battery entirely. I don't fault the seller who sent this battery out asap--but I do fault the description of this item on amazon.
4,Battery saved me,I needed a new battery for my phone and the local dealer didn't have it in stock. The rep suggested going on line to Amazon.com which I thought was very thoughtful on her part. I didn't have any problems ordering the battery; the cost wasn't out of reach and it arrived in a couple of days which amazed me.
1,Sorry I ordered!,"The vendor, AccessoryOne has my money (of course), someone at the United States Postal Service (USPS) has the stuff I ordered, and I have nothing. Amazon has been NO HELP in resolving the problem. I will never again order anything through Amazon, from AccessoryOne, or anything delivered by the United States Postal Service (USPS). Classical example of why this country is going downhill. Greed, incompetence, and indifference! I would have given zero stars, but the system won't let you."
1,monitor,"I think somebody made an auful mistake.I got the monitor ok, enough but there wa s no play station with it.so laying all things a side i think that you get what you pay for. well i paid for the whole thing so I WANTT ONE SENT IN THE MAIL with no charge for it I am thorally disgusted with this.if i dont get one soon or confirmation about it i will be forced to send it backJoseph Smith"
4,The worst LSD screen ever,"I got this screen for christmas. I was so excited when I got it. I worked good at first and then the second day it broke. I was so mad. So I got an exchange and the stupid junk screen still didnt work. just yestarday I actually got the Intec Dance mat. That was just as bad as the LSD screen was. So dont buy this get the offcial one. If Intec reads this I want to say to them, You people put no effort in your work. You make horrible things. and I hope Intec company learns how to make things. oh yeah after the exchange it broke again. I was so sad because my mom payed $[item price]for it and wasted her money. and now I feel bad. Thanks for nothing Intec. Your company is the worst I ever saw in my life..."
2,DON'T GET THIS SCREEN AT ALL!!!,I don't want to get this screen ever again!! about 47% out of100% of kids don't like this screen. It had miner problems withbrightness/ hard to control with the color. I just read that one kid was correct on this screen. I got this screen on Febuary for my early birthday. About 5 mounths later it had electric problems. I turned it back.
2,BAD SCREEN !!!,When I got this screen on my early birthday from Feburary.I thought it would by any good but I found out that it was to bright and about 4 mounths later it broke down. So I turned it toysrus to get the standered LCD screen and this one worked better then the other screen. I had to buy the adapter for the car for this screen at Best Buy. Don't Buy this screen because it's a trick. The manager was very kind to exhange the broken down screen to the standered LCD screen.
1,Not all it is cracked up to be,"Very nice board that fit the criteria of being pretty and thick which is what my wife wanted. First board ordered arrived with a huge crack in the middle. Amazon was great and sent another board overnight to replace that one. 3 weeks later the replacement board, with very light use, developed a huge crack in it as well. I cannot recommend this product and encourage others to look at different cutting boards."
3,Decent Product; False Advertising,"I don't know much about beach balls. They're quality, as far as I can tell. Lightweight, round, and brightly colored; what more do you ask for in a beach ball?However, the claim seems to be that the ball is 12"" diameter. That measurement is actually half the circumference. The diameter is slightly under 8"". Most people probably aren't that picky about the size of their beach ball, but if it matters to you, be warned!"
2,Not worth it.,"I own 3 coffee presses, all made by BonJour and I love 2 of them. This one is made with lexan, plastic plunger and a rubber O ring. There is always lots of floating coffee bits to many too scoop out and too many to ignor. Don't get it, but a glass one."
2,Coffee Press way too small,"This french press made a delicious cup of coffee. The problem is that it is advertised as a ""3 cup"" coffeemaker. I returned it and will get a larger size."
5,The life of a hospital orderly is transformed as he seeks redemption as an Alaska cannery worker.,"I found the journey of Billy McCord in Barometer's Shadow a most compelling experience. Mr. Kaufman's descriptive narratives of McCord working in an Alaska cannery, shoveling crabs with a bunch of brutal roughnecks, fishing for Salmon, and meeting the love of his life, takes the reader for a near-real-life ride.I highly recommend the book for all readers, but anyone fascinated with Alaska will especially find it a great read."
5,A classic,"This is a book that I was introduced to when I started selling insurance in 1972. I have reread it every year since. Although the examples are old, they are as applicable now as they were when the book was written."
1,Not a well-argued defence of creationism (if there is such a thing!),"When I was a high school student, a religious great aunt sent me this book because she had heard that I was interested in science. Up to that point it had not actually occured to me to question the account of creation in Genesis. After reading this book, however, and considering its contrived arguments, I became convinced that the proper scientific explanations based on refutable conjectures (e.g. Darwinian evolution and modern astophysics) offered better explanations for the origin of the world. Ironically, this book helped lauch an intellectual journey that led me completely away from Christianity to the secular (or at most, Deistic) viewpoint that I now hold while working as a research scientist."
3,Miss Lucy - A woman ahead of her time,"Salmond does a great job of showing the variety of causes for which Lucy Randolph Mason worked her entire life. While briefly discussing her lineage, he tirelessly discusses the organizations with which she was associated in both a paid and volunteer capacity. This book is not about the CIO, the YWCA, the NCL, etc. This is about the life of Lucy Randolph Mason, and if you want to know about her life and times and don't have much time, this relatively short and easy to read book is for you. Salmond doesn't sugar coat things, he discusses the painful parts of her life as well as the tragic end of her life, and you can't help but feel inadequate when seeing all that Mason did with her life at a time when a woman in public was relatively uncommon. If you are looking for information on anything other than Mason, you should continue looking, because this book will be of little assistance."
2,Not for Espresso!,This machine is a fine buy for the price -- but don't try to grind espresso. The tolerance of the burr mechanism just isn't tight enough for fine espresso. Look at grinders >$150 if you are a true latte lover.
1,It stopped working,"It stopped working after a little less than 6 months. It was great while it was functioning, however!"
1,"Good looks, bad performance","This grinder looked great on our countertop, but after just three days, it decided not to work anymore. Also, Amazon sent this defective item, which was purchased using a gift certificate I earned for the purchase of a bread machine, and now says the gift certificate has expired. HOW'S THAT FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY SEND A DEFECTIVE ITEM, AND NOW I CAN'T REPLACE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!Don't buy this item, and don't do business with Amazon !! Also, bewarwe of the reviews, and make sure you look at all. Amazon only lists the good reviews, unless you click to see all reviews. What a company !!"
2,Clogs much too often,"This grinder looks great and has lots of settings, but it clogs and won't grind most of the coffee I use. I use Starbuck's or beans from our local roasting company, which are often more oily than those from the grocery store, but I would think that most people who grind their coffee at home use this type of bean. If it weren't clogged up all the time, this would be a great grinder. But if it won't grind, what good is it?"
1,Don't bother,"We bought this grinder because we wanted a burr-type grinder, this one looked pretty good, and the price was right. Bad idea!1. So much static electricity accumulates in the thing that you can't take the lid off to fill the coffee maker without coffee grinds flying everywhere. A mess all over the counter every time.2. It got stuck and wouldn't grind anymore after about 1-2 months of use. We complained and asked about getting it repaired, but we were told we'd be sent a new one instead of repair information (only after cutting off and sending in the plug from the old one, though!). Communications with DeLonghi through this replacement process were inconsistent, though reasonably polite.3. The replacement grinder broke, in exactly the same way, after about the same amount of use!We're back to our blade grinder."
1,Coffee Beans not ground fine enough,"This machine does not grind the coffee beans fine enough for our Krups Cappuchino maker, even though we tamp down the powder into the basket as we always did. The result is an extremely weak coffee, which we might as well not bother drinking.We are very unhappy with our purchase. We used to have a blender with blades and wanted to try out a ""burr"" grinder. I am considering buying a blade style grinder again.Amazon's policy says that you need to return the machine ""unused"" and like new. How is it possible for you to know how well a machine works, without ever using it? I think this is the last time we will buy any applicance online at Amazon."
3,Just average,"This product does an OK (but not great) job of grinding coffeebeans. It does a better fine grind than coarse grind, so don'texpect great results if your use it for a Bodum French press ora Moka stovetop unit. Average amount of noise and static chargeproduced. All in all, it's not any better than my older Capressoburr grinder, only slightly easier to clean. I returned the unitto Amazon. If you really need a serious burr grinder for yourgourmet coffee beans, count on spending at least $100 for one ofthe semi-commercial units."
1,I'm very disappointed with this unit,"This thing certainly looks great on my kitchen counter, but it has not worked well for me at all. I've had two specific problems: One is that there's a micro switch that keeps the unit from turning on when the grounds carrier is removed - which is fine except that every time I remove the carrier to get the ground coffee I have to really struggle to get it to seat properly again so that it will run. Coffee grinds naturally collect in the area of the micro switch preventing the carrier from seating properly against the switch. It's really frustrating. The other problem is on the top end where the whole beans feed down into the grinder. They regularly get into a little log jam such that the grinder is still whirring away but no beans are feeding down. I have to try jiggling and knocking the whole unit until the beans start feeding again. Overall, I've found this to be a REALLY disappointing purchase."
2,Unreliable motor,"The first one I ordered from Amazon arrived DOA (dead of arrival). Amazon replaced it; the second one died after two months. I loved it while it worked, but it really should last much longer."
5,OUTSTANDING,"I have gone thru over a dozen coffee grindrs in the past. Sams Club now sells Starbucks French Roast BEANS in 3 pound bags and it takes an hour standing at their grinder to get espresso grind. What a pain. I couldn't afford a commercial one like they have at Starbucks outlets so I went to DeLonghi on the internet whre I bought several things and there was this Retro Burr Grinder. I couldn't resist and the price was more than reasonable. Got it home and read the instructions which were very simple. Filled up the hopper and...voila! I couldn't be happier. So simple top use and you can leave the ground coffee in the lower hopper to last the week. no more having to grind each morning before getting to make the coffee. I couldn't be happier! Did I already say that? Anyway, it is nowhere near as loud as my little one that will be in the bag for the Big Brothers & Sisters collection."
5,Best coffee grounds!,"I consider myself to be a connoisseur of all things coffee, or at least just someone who cannot live without it. This unit is exactly what I needed. It allows you the control to find the perfect grind and has an automatic timer to ensure this. The reservoir is plenty large and store enough beans for a few brews. I'm impressed with the quality of its build, as it is both stylish and very sturdy."
1,Not Good for Espresso.,"If you're thinking about grinding coffee for an espresso machine with this grinder: forget it! The finest (""espresso"") grind is coarse enough for drip coffee! I even disassembled the thing to see if I can manually adjust it, but no such luck. By the way, I also noticed the componenets are cheaply made while I had the machine open. I am giving it one star because I can't give it less, and also because it looks cool, but it will ook even better in my garbage can tonight ;-)"
2,No good for espresso,"The machine does make a consistent grind without heating up the coffee, but it does not produce a fine enough grind for making espresso, even at the finest setting. You know how finely ground coffee stains the fingers? The coffee grounds from this grinder do not leave a trace.Bottom line: great for drip coffee or French press, not good enough for espresso makers. (And don't even think about making Turkish coffee with the grounds from this machine...)"
2,Clogs Every Other Use,As others have mentioned this grinder clogs too often. In my case it clogs every other use. Even if I take the burrs apart and clean it very well it still clogs. This is due to a poor design in the distribution spout being too narrow. If you ever look at professional grade burr grinders you will notice the spout where ground coffee comes out is very wide. You get what you pay for.
1,"Poor Design, Save Your Money","I would NOT recommend this unit.I have had my unit a little over four months. I love the look. I love the concept of dialing in the grind and amount and letting the grinder do the work. When it all worked, I loved it.The burr grinder gets clogged easily, especially if you use flavored beans. I have to baby sit the grinder to ensure that the grinding continues properly.Now its dead. I suspect that the micro switch is clogged. If I can figure out where that is, I'll clean it."
2,It was great - at first.,"I've had this grinder for 10 months now. Use it often and always keep it very clean, including the grinding mechanism. At first it was great, grinding beans to a fine powder for espresso. Slowly but surely this ""fine powder"" is becoming more course with each time I use it. I just called DeLonghi customer service and was told that the burr grinders were probably worn out and that the machine cannot be repaired because they don't make parts for it."
1,DeLonghi Coffee Grinder,I am very disappointed in this coffee grinder. It has never worked properly and takes an inordinate amount of time to grind some coffee beans. It worked the first few times I used it and now it works occassionally - I think the coffee grinds interfere with the contacts. I have gone back to using a standard grinder and my DeLonghi grinder sits on the counter.
3,"It looks good, but it is not ultra absorbent.","The good: It looks good with the picture on it. The bad: it only absorb a little amount of water. When a glass of iced tea (with ice cubes in it) is put on this coaster, after it sits a while on it, the water from the condensation is just too much for this ""ultra absorbent"" coaste to absorb, and the water will spill out of the coaster."
1,Coaster Image,The Sandstone Coasters image did not meet my exppectations as it was not the Eittel Tower. Rather it was a picture of flowers.
3,pretty good,"i use to hear Dan hartman jams back in the day and this collection is pretty good,but the money cut is the title cut. Instant Replay the cut that just stands out and it is still a cut that you can still Groove to. Hartman understood Groove and vibe and that is what got his stuff over. this is a pretty good collection and you will feel the Groove."
4,a rosetta stone cd,"this will be very quick as i bought this cd for one song.love is a natural is a great example of disco, with shrieking swirling string arrangements, a popping bass line and a searing vocal by a male artist that knew what he was doing. i'm glad i found it after steve dahl tried to blow up all the wonderful songs that make up disco.as for the rest, it's anyone's guess."
5,Confessions of Madame Psyche,"This book has always been one of my favorites. I'm a 4th generation Californian and have lived my whole life in either Napa or San Francisco. I loved the Historical and physical descriptions of the places Madame Psyche lived and worked. The book was so real to me that I wanted to call my great Aunt, who at one time was an administrative head of Napa hospital, to see if there were any more records of Mei Li. I never wanted this book to end."
5,Great first album from John Mark McMillan.,"This is from one of the best young Christian artists and an awesome freshman album. It has all of his usual depth and heart poured into the lyrics. I was glad to see that he reissued ""The Song Inside the Sounds of Breaking Down"" and wished he would have reissued this CD as well. I spoke with John after a concert in Holland, MI and asked if he planned to do that. He said that he couldn't because he lost all of the files. If you find ""Hope Anothology Volume One"", you better snatch it up quickly."
2,just okay,"I find I never use the DaVinci tool and I sometimes will use the Still point inducer. I went through a phase where I had such horrible knots in my back that I was willing to try anything. The DaVinci tool was too awkward to use and place in the right spot & get it to stay. I found the Backnobber II to be most effective for knots. When my sinuses are bothering my skull/head, I'll use the Still Point Inducer..but it only temporarily feels good. As soon as I get up from using it, I still have the same sinus pressure. If I was to do it all over again, I would not have bothered to purchase these items."
4,Worth while Investment,"A local massage therapist recommended the still point inducer to me after I mentioned my frequent headaches. When I saw the DaVinci Tool paired with it, I went ahead and ordered both. If someone is only able to purchase one then I would definitely recommend the still point inducer. The DaVinci Tool is very firm (even the red one which is the less firm of the two offered) and so sometimes it is a little much. If you struggle with headaches or are just looking for a way to help your body relax, I suggest trying these out! They are a much better solution then taking headache pills. All the best!"
3,Softer then I thought.,"After reading the previous reviews, I thought the Da Vinci Tool soft would be a good fit for me. It turns out it was softer then I had thought. But between the two tools, I find I can relax and get almost any point relieved. Nice to have them both for days my husband can rub my back with the Still Point Inducer, or he likes it on his calves where he has scar tissue. Good purchase, good value, but not exactly what I wanted. I will be getting the firm Da Vinci once I build up my tolerance a bit."
3,"just alright, I rather just do yoga or lay on a yoga ball now","I honestly don't use this much anymore...maybe once every few months. I used the soft DaVinci Tool each day for about 2 weeks but only use it once every few months now. The best, sustainable way for me to get rid of pains and aches anywhere on my body/neck is yoga. I especially like hot yoga but when time is really short or I'm really lazy, just laying on a yoga ball with my head hanging is effective at relieving pain. Overall, not a bad tool to have laying around on those really bad days when your neck is super tight."
2,the real highlight is the SOundtrack,this is film overall has nothing on the orginal.a few things about it are alright but the Music is the Real Diamond.Donny Hathaway&Quincy Jones on the Soundtrack is a must.THe Main Actors are cool but this Film doesn't really go anywhere.the First one is a Classic.
4,good toy,My guinea pig is not really a fan of chewing things so I was surprised when I found teethmarks all over it. And the pig goes wild. A good buy for any anti toy pet.
4,Carolina Scots...,"I found this book interesting, insightful and helpful. My mother's came from Scotland/Ireland and helped settle North Carolina in the 1700's - it was great to see some of my ancestors mentioned in the book. For anyone who is looking for some general history about their Scottish ancestors who helped settle the Carolinas this is a good choice."
2,Carolina Scots,"I was dissappointed. The research for the book lacked depth and originality. Some of the family geneologies were inaccurate and incomplete. The time line was too recent to be of any significant value. For the purpose of research, a better list of reading material could be had from the local County Historical Societies and from the state archives. Bought it, read it, sold it."
5,"Should Be ""Tony Iommi: Never Say Die""","This book shows in great detail what Tony Iommi had to go through to keep Black Sabbath alive all these years.Some may think periods such as the Fenholt chapter are overdone but I'd disagree. The facts here leave no doubt, at least by my interpretation, that he was never in Black Sabbath.There are stories of Tony Martin either turning up or almost turning up when you least expect him...The ""Born Again"" chapter is just a ride!""Never Say Die"" manages to organize rather well a very chaotic period of Black Sabbath's history while maintaining a detailed fascinating read. Some stuff we knew but most we didn't. You will be suprised and, honestly, maybe shocked by some of the details in this book for sure.A must read for anybody that doesn't think Black Sabbath died with Ozzy's departure. The only complaint is an appalling lack of an editor but that's nitpicking compared to the high quality of detail both large and small.A well-earned 5 stars."
3,A Cat Chasing It's Tail...,"Well! after reading all the positive about this book, I though I had better give it a go and have a read.Much to my surprise, it was quite a ramble given all the 'ARTISTS' the author had interviewed to construct the plot.As with many of todays Music Biographies, the farther the story teller is removed from the actual occurance, the less convincing the information relayed is..There is nothing here I am afraid to excite, It should have been a book as thick as 'WAR AND PEACE' given the cavalcade of Musicians that Tony Iommi shipped in and out to fill the original members boots, and keep the Black Sabbath flag flying.This book is definitely Tony Iommis Black Sabbath; and not Black Sabbaths, BLACK SABBATH.....That being said, it is Worth a read..."
5,Sent to Iraq for the troops to hand out to kids.,"What can I say? The good old Spaldeen hi-bounce that we used to play stick ball with. I purchased a case of them and sent them to Iraq for the troops to use to spread good will with the kids. The Soldiers and the kids had a blast playing stick ball, catch, hand ball and inventing their own games. Good high quality rubber balls. Anyone who grew up in the City knows all about the hi-bouncers."
3,Like a racquetball but larger,"If you are looking for a hollow bouncing ball, you will probably like this ball. I was looking for a solid rubber ball for foot exercises. This ball will not suffice for that use."
3,"DISREGARD THE PICTURE. IT'S ONLY ONE, NOT TWO.",Please don't display two items when the purchase is for only one. It is very misleading and caused a surprise for me when my package arrived.
2,Too little for too much,"I know I'm supposed to read, but when a pair of products is pictured and only one arrives - I feel ripped off."
3,Only one ball arrived but two are pictured,"The ball is fine, but I was not happy that the picture included two balls and the price indicated the same."
5,ok,"ok, I hate to have to review everything in life, thank God i do not have to do it check out at the food store."
1,Satisfaction,"Not at all what I expected, shipping cost as much as item, I ordered a cd and the ball so delivery packages should have been together. Display of item was not clear to me, I thought it would be larger in size."
2,"Easy to use, but . .",Left my skin slightly orange. Color on feet and hands was sort of streaked.Would not buy again. I might mention I have very light skin.
1,terrible,"i did not purchase them from amazon, but this product is terrible! this self tanner smells bad looks orange and is extremely streaky! i was careful when applying but obviously not careful enough, i wouldn't recommend this product."
3,Sreaking and unnatural coloring,I am fair skinned and I thought the med would be dark enough for me. It was orange and streaked so bad that it didn't come off for two weeks. It is hard to judge if you got every area because there isn't a tinting solution. Would not buy again. Disgusting coloring!
1,Not a pleased consumer!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this product hoping to add some nice color to my pale complexion. I spent an hour prepping my skin (bathing, exfoliating, drying properly, adding moisturizer to knees elbows..etc) for my what(I thought)would be tan. I squeeze out a generous amount to apply to my skin.. and I see millions of tiny little sparkles in this ""lovely"" tanner. They are very very obvious, and honestly.. its not remotely attractive. Thousands of tiny little sparkles that don't wash off in the shower are covering my body. I look like my 4 year old daughter that just spilled glitter all over herself. Next, I notice after applying that it is drying a dark orange color and that its flaking off! I had patches bigger than quarters flaking off.. and the areas that did not flake off were stained this creamsicle orange color. Great job L'Oreal! BUYERS BEWARE!"
3,Pros and Cons,"When I first began using this self-tanner I was delighted with the product and bought a box or two wherever I saw it being sold. I applied it every other day and was delighted with the increasing depth of my tan. Then my skin began to look mottled and I spent a fortune buying every product mentioned in articles on removal of self-tanner -- mostly abrasives such as baking powder and salt scrubs. I went for two weeks without applying any self-tanner while it wore away on its own. I have resumed use of the product but only once/week. I achieve a much lighter color but it does not ""curdle"" on me. P.S. This is by no means the only self-tanner that causes problems with repeated/frequent application. I think it's an unfortunate by-product of the genre."
5,L'Oreal Bronze,This tanning product works very well if you do exactly as directed. I had a few packages left from last year and used them first before reordering; they were still good. Enjoy!!!!
2,Less Than Impressed,I used these as directed and discovered that they don't work nearly as well as the L'Oreal cream self-tanning product that I have used in the past...big disappointment. I won't be ordering again.
5,tan towel,"Love love love this!!! I have used different types of self tanners, including spray tans, and this by far is the best!!"
2,not enough color,i have used these for years and always got good color...purchased from the drugstore. this box from amazon is probably old or they have changed. hardly any color after using two towels and in two days the color is gone
3,Got the wrong product sent to me....,"I have an automatice shipment order for the Loreal Self Tanning BODY towelettes, received correct shipment first time...this last time got the FACE towelettes....How do I make sure to get the BODY towelettes each time? Is the a price difference and I'll keep the face towelettes as I needed to use one box as BODY towelettes...PLEASE send me the BODY towelettes!!!! I'll pay for them. The BODY towelettes are wonderful...I miss getting them...."
3,Tanning Bed Smell,"This does have a smell after you put it on, which smells like a tanning bed to me. I am going to try a lotion. I have tried the loreal spray and am not crazy about that either because I worry about what else it is getting on besides me."
3,Was a 5 star but downgraded,"I have used these for a few yrs and found them easy, portable, dependable, generally effective and pleasant. Now they have a 'new scent' which is not any better than the original scent, AND the degree of darkness is lighter than I was used to. Another ""If it's not broke please don't fix it"" moment. I will try to find original packages in my local stores, not an easy task as it's not widely carried."
4,Amazing!,"MUCH better than all the lotions, sprays and foams I've used! Does not streak (unless you forget to apply to a section) or go on unevenly (even if you reapply to a certain area). Dries incredibly quickly. Very good color, but in the direct sunlight it stills looks a tiny bit orange. Indoors, the color looks amazing and like a real tan. Of course the hands are tricky to tan evenly, as with most product; I rub the towel all over the tops of my hands last and rub a cottonball soaked in rubbing alcohol on the fingers and palms of my hands to avoid orange palms. This product still has that sunless tanner smell, but I've smelled much stronger odor in most other products. For the price and how long they last, I'll continue buying these!"
4,Best at home self tanning product I've used,These are really easy to use and not messy. Just be careful to cover the area fully because you do get a nice dark at home tan with this product and if you miss a spot it will be noticeable!
3,"I DO love Loreal, but...","I hate saying anything negative about my ""tried and true"" brand, Loreal. I have used their lotion self tanner for years with people asking how I am always so brown. When not using more expensive make up and hair color lines, Loreal is all that I will use. However, their towelettes did not measure up.What I loved was a product with finally NO smell! I loved the quick dry! I love the fact that you can travel with these. But...The tan does not stay long. It peels off if you rub your skin. I did not get much color at all. And most importantly, even though I exfoliated first and kept my skin moisturized, for the first time ever, I looked at my arms and could see my skin kind of flaking off, as if I hadn't exfoliated. It looked incredibly dry and it was only a day later that the color was peeling off.Seems it just needs some improving and it will be a great product."
4,Best Sunless Tanning Product Yet,"I love these towelettes! I am light skinned (but not pale) and have eczema on my arms that make them red. When I use this product it makes my skin tone look more even (as well as giving me a little color) and my eczema is not as noticeable. I followed another reviewers advice and made sure I shaved the day before using, and showered the day of, but let my skin dry for at least 15 minutes afterwards before applying the towelette to it. I also applied it in circular motions as not to cause a streaky look. Works great!"
2,"Streaks, smells bad, looks orange","I have very fair skin. Used this last night following instruction, woke up this morning with streaks and big spots on my legs. Okay, streaks I can understand because maybe I missed applying, but spots? How is it possible to miss such a big spot on my leg? OH,and my co-workers said they can smell the tanning lotion on me. The tan also look really fake. I should've just used my neutrogena spray tan instead of this. Will not buy again."
1,Take Any Other Guide Book,"Just returned from my second six week trip to Brazil. I own practically every guide book on the country and foolishly brought along this one. The information in the latest edition seems not to have been updated for a couple of years and I wasted a good amount of taxi fares or time walking to recommended places that were no longer in business. Even in the major cities, English isn't often spoken by the people outside of the tourism infrastructure. This can be frustrating without some preparation. Fortunately, I speak Portuguese and found many of the best restaurants etc. from the local people or through the particular city tourism authority. Another thing that I didn't like about the ""Rough Guide"" is that it doesn't include locations of internet cafes like other guidebooks do. For the price of the book, I give this particular Brazil edition one star.Take my advice and take any other guide book with you or you'll truly have a ""Rough"" time with this ""Rough Guide""."
2,Disappointing,"I am a Rough Guide aficionado but I'm disappointed by this book. I have the 4th updated edition (December 2000) but to me it seems as though this is a rather messy update, especially on the part of accommodation. Places that have moved 5 years ago (according to the owner) are in the book still at the old location. Or a pousada that is described as `charming place build right on the riverbank' has almost all of its windows broken and must have been closed for years. On the other hand a lot of nice budget options are not in the book while others that are in the book have been closed. And the thing that bothers me the most is that in several occasions addresses of tourist information offices are wrong. Fortunately for the editors the `things to see and do' doesn't change to much over the years so they don't have to update this."
3,not as good as the Lonely Planet guide,"The Rough Guide to Brazil is a very good book and I did get by fine with it but time and again fellow travellers using the Lonely Planet Brazil or South America books had more information, especially about accomodation in places off the beaten track. It would be good if there was more information about Pantanal tours too, it's difficult to know which companies are reputable and at least if they were in the guide book you'd know they'd been established for a while. Other things not made clear were how difficult it is to change travellers cheques if they're not American Express and how crucial it is to have a little Portuguese."
5,Love the shirt!,I have absolutely enjoyed wearing this t-shirt. Good quality and has been a conversation piece. Will definitly continue to do business with this company.
5,bittersweet,"Excellent! Susan's life book reads like an intriguing novel. I loved her humility, candor, and insight. She was a truly wise and gifted woman."
2,Non-horror movie,"This is supposed to be a horror film? I'm sorry I wasn't scared throughout the whole film. I was expecting a horror master not a boredom master. This is not a horror movie people. This is a suspense movie with a who-dunnit type feel to it. This movie has a science fiction ending and the Avatar aliens make an apperance in this film. I know it was probably scary for some but not for a horror fan. If you are a true horror fan this will put you to sleep. If you are not into horror movies and scare easily than this is for you. I'm sorry I expect a horror master to bring on the horror and gore. This movie had Brandon Walsh from 90210 being a killer. I'm sorry Brandon your not scary, bring Dillion he has potential to be scary. Stay away true horror fans this movie has nothing for you."
2,Ehhh...,"The acting is overdone. To a laughable point. Each actor reads his or her line like they are standing up in the middle of a high-school class and reading their essay for the teacher. The concept of the movie ought to have been brought down to a realistic level. Really? All men turning into lewd sexual and aggressive creatures? The film is funny, but not intended to be so. I don't even think a Valerie Solonas would enjoy this film. I'm giving it two stars because everyone involved actually made this film and put it out on Netflix. They got somewhere, at least."
2,They didn't find the solution to effectively dramatizing this story,"While the murder of women takes on epidemic proportions throughout the world, a young researcher (Jason Priestley) and his loved ones (Kerry Norton, Brenna O'Brien, and Elliot Gould) struggle to understand and survive the apocalyptic consequences.Director Joe Dante and writer Sam Hamm fail to make the most of SF author James Tiptree, Jr.'s chilling premise by attempting to cover too much ground in an hour-long drama. Everything feels too rushed and the big revelation at the end is botched by relying on blind coincidence to force it into the story."
3,Competent film of a fantastic story,"It's worth watching, especially if you never read the story it's based on. I'd recommend then going on to read the story, which is one of very, very few that have stuck in my head for years. (You can find it in James Tiptree, Jr.'sHer Smoke Rose Up Forever.) Of course, this might be due to a transference of my general terror of parasites (and hence, screwflies) to the story itself.As other reviewers have pointed out, it's not as much a ""horror"" movie as others in the series, but I think how much it gives you the chills is likely based on your own life experiences. Anyone who's had a serious run-in with a physically abusive man will likely have nightmares after watching it...."
2,"Interesting premise, terrible acting","It was like watching a cheap ""Movie Of The Week."" Absolutely horrible acting. I realize the plot and circumstances that lead to the behavior of the characters, but the reactions of the onlookers were something of the nature of ""Shawn Of The Dead."" - almost comical. Even Elliot Gould and Jason Priestly seemed like they were reading off a script. The supporting actors weren't any better or convincing, which took away the effect of the movie."
4,interesting horror,The screwfly solution was rated R18 in Australia.However it doen't have too many gory scenes to justify such a rating.
3,"""I'm a married man, I have a daughter and I am a potential murderer""","The Masters of Horror series brings us sixty-minute episodes that cover a wide range of topics in the genre. In this installment, the story revolves around an attempt by an unknown entity to eliminate the human race. The story is fine, but there are a couple of problems with this episode. First, I think that this barely makes it into the horror genre; it seems more of a psychological thriller. The second problem is that the ending left me unsatisfied, since I felt it was a poor explanation to the reasons behind the events.On the plus side, the acting was pretty good, especially for a horror production. In particular, I liked the performance of Elliott Gould, as Barney, a scientist trying to stop the debacle. Overall, episode is OK, but I would not recommend it to those that are new to the series. I think that going forThe Black Catis a better option."
3,Good acting with a very different story,I enjoyed this MOH installment being that it was so different. You really have to think outside the box to enjoy this one. The acting was very good and the premise was very original. It wasn't scary but it did provide a creepy undertone. I would recommend this one if you are looking for a change of pace.
2,A LITTLE BIT SCREWY,"This entry in the compelling MOH series is a little strange, mixing social commentary with a small dose of horror. The world is suddenly going mad, at least its male population...sexual arousal is leading men to murder the woman responsible...and soon it's just men murdering women. Two scientists offer a solution, as evidenced by the control of the dangerous screwfly population. But no one listens, and of course disaster ensues.Director Joe Dante doesn't do anything compellingly different, and the acting by Jason Priestley and Elliott Gould is merely adequate. Not a sterling entry in this otherwise good series."
5,cool!,This toy is the funnist toy !When i got this toy i never stopped using it!I love scrapbooking so if u like it or some one in your family likes scrapbooking i would sujest to buy this kit!
4,Daphne's Lot,Some writing throughout the book.Name written in pen on the first page.Otherwise in good condition.
4,Well-written history for the non-historian,"This book is a terrific biography of Savonarola. Erlanger does an excellent job of bringing out both the culture of Renaissance Florence and the personality of Savonarola himself. Throughout the book, the reader gets a real sense of what life must have been like in that time. She also gives no easy answer to the question of whether Savonarola was a saint or a fraud. Instead, she paints us a picture of a very real and complex human being, part sinner and part saint and with a soul impenetrable to anyone but God and himself. The historical events are also related in a way that serves to keep the reader interested, often with a great measure of suspense and emotion. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about the Italian Renaissance and outstanding figures and cultural movements it produced."
1,Does not stick!,"I normally got these from my PT office, but I decided to buy online. I put on the electrodes the night I got them, and they won't stick for more than a few minutes. They are the same brand (Empi) as my TENS unit and previous supplies, but they do not work."
3,Toddler's first game...,"This was purchased as my 3 year old grandson's first game. He loved it from the moment it was taken out of the box and played it non-stop for almost 2 hours. The game is simple enough for a 3 year old to understand the concept, and the opening of the doors to find the brightly colored balls provides instant gratification. I am sorry to say that as much as Ethan loves the game, the main piece needed to play it, namely the ""key"" to open the doors, is not sturdy enough. As much as Ethan loves to play with this game, the tip of the key broke off, and now the game cannot be played. I am very disappointed, as is Ethan."
5,help me get this toy,"please could some one contact me regarding this toy game, i am having a hard time buying it off amazon, and i have been trying to buy this game for my little boy who is autistic my email address is lovingmyboys@live.ca please help me get this game for him thanks you"
5,Cariboo,"My 3 year old son loves it. He plays with it constantly.It was recommended by his teacher to help his speach. Since using the game, his speach is now much clearer."
2,Great Game but Key Broke After a Few Plays,"We purchased this game for my 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He LOVED playing the game. He would play with the cards as the instructions directed with an adult and he also enjoyed playing by himself simply finding the hidden balls. It was a very easy game for him to understand and lots of fun (I even enjoyed playing it). My only complaint is the key used to unlock the hidden doors is very cheap. After a few days of play, the tip broke off and we could no longer play the game. A big disappointment for a [...] game."
3,Cranium Cariboo,The five year old enjoyed the game as it was designed to be played. The soon-to-be three year old didn't have a clue. Would I buy it for another child? Probably not.
4,cranium cariboo - great game,"I purchased this for my four year old for Christmas. We have played it many times since. She loves it!!! Her seven year old brother really enjoys it as well. It perfectly combines an educational experience in a fun game format. The only fault I find with the game is that the balls do not ""roll"" into place as the directions indicate, and I usually have to manually place them. If I don't, there are always a few that are free floating, and that kind of ruins the game. I'm sure this design flaw could be fixed, and that would make it the perfect game. Despite this, I find it one of the better games that we own, and I would highly recommend it."
4,Kids love it,"At the start I found this game to be dumb, but it has since grown on me. We love to play it with my daughter (She loves it).Very educational for the little monkeys.The biggest weakness of the game is that when you open a door, you can see under the adjacent doors. My daughter loves to cheat by looking under. My wife ""modded"" the rules to close the door after opening it. (Thus all doors are closed at all times). This has made the game more challenging because of the need to remember previously opened doors."
4,Cariboo,"Fun and educational. Good for color, shape and letter recognition. Just a few small issues 1) you can peek in the holes to see where the balls are and 2) the top part of the game is made of plastic but the bottom is made of cardboard - so, I'm not sure how well it will hold up. Still, a very fun game and I would definitely recommend it."
5,Great game for everyone,"We got this game for our 4 year old daughter, but the whole family loves to play it, even our 2 year old. It's a pretty durable toy. I would say that the only ""issue"" is that you can cheat by peeking in the holes to see where the balls are, but that's not really a big deal. The kids just love winning and getting the big jewel in the treasure chest. I would recommend it to anyone. It's good for color identification (for the little ones) and letter identification for the older kids."
2,Fun at first but not very challenging for my 3 1/2 year old,"My son loved the game the first 3 times he played it, but he has already lost interest. Identifying colors and letters? The age level for this game of 3-8 is insulting to older children. I think my son would have liked the game better if he played it when he just turned 3 but he will be 4 in a few months. OK for children who are learning colors and letters but otherwise a bore."
5,My 3-year-old LOVES this game!,"I have been woken up to ""Cariboo, Mommy?"" That pretty much says it all...it is his favorite game on the planet. I actually enjoy it too- it is not as mind-numbing as Chutes and Ladders or some of the other basic roll-and-move type of game. Even my 5-year-old daughter loves playing it with him. My only complaint isn't really a complaint, but I wish that there was a booster set or some additional cards available for purchase. The ""easy"" side of the cards is easy for a 3-year-old, but the ""advanced"" side is too difficult. It would be nice if there were more options. Overall- I highly recommend. It is educational and fun- what a great combination!"
5,Hiheels,"Thank you Shonda for Scandal and thank you YOUTUBE for your video montages of Fitz and Olivia. I am a big fan of Shonda Rhimes, I watch Grey's Anatomy religiously, I still watch Private Practice even though it hasn't been the same since Audra McDonald left, and I even watched Off the Map which was not her best work, but Scandal.......I haven't been this obsessed over two fictional characters since Luke and Laura. Olivia and Fitz are HOT. Chemistry is not even the word that can aptly describe their interactions. I enjoy the summer and don't want to rush the 3 months of sunny bliss but I cannot wait until September to get reconnected with Pope and associates and the White House including Cyrus and Melli. Scandal has the BEST CAST EVER!!!!! Add Phylicia Rashad as Olivia's mother and bring back Audra as Liv's half sister and I think I can die a happy woman."
1,Complete crap!,"Watch this nonsense at your own risk. Designed to play to the emotional underbelly of the psychologically damaged.Not intended for intelligent human beings, please avoid this garbage!"
5,I love this show,Best show on TV will be ordering season two very soon would recommend this to everyone should be nominated for an award.
4,Season 1,"In the first episodes is so slow,but the ritmic improve in the middle until the final episodes is very active"
5,I am hooked,I have not been this hooked since the 24 series. The characters are off the chain. It keeps me on the edge of my seat!I am here to purchase the DVD enough said!
5,ALOT OF ACTION,I loved it I enjoyed the action and the characters in this t.v. show. It was like watching a movie it was put together so well.
5,must have,never see it before my cousin show it at my house and from then i had to have it thanks to my cousin and amazon too
5,Good product and television show,I am obsessed with this show since I started watching it over a month ago. For the product: Nice packaging. There are two discs. I liked to hear some of the background of the show with the special features. The only thing is that I wanted to also see how Tony Goldwyn auditioned and received his part.
5,mrs olivia she just keeps you glued to your seat,I have to use my DVR every so I can catch every word she says. And the president now that entirely a different story
5,Hooked on Scandal,Loved it! Couldn't stop watching! I feel like I'm a part of the team! I am super jealous of the immense passion between the main characters.
5,This show is awesome!!!,I absolutely love this show. Kerry Washington is brilliant and vibrant as the fixer. She will do whatever it takes to get the job accomplished successfully. She is surrounded by a group of individuals who share her go getter attitude. This show makes for great entertainment. You never know what will happen next which keeps you completely intrigued.
3,I expected more,I thought there was more to the first season I really didn’t miss much it was good I just expected more to be uncovered but it really wasn’t. TV on demand didn’t show any of the first season that’s why I ordered it but if you watch the second season repeats you really haven’t missed much of the first season. It was good but as I mentioned I expected more.
2,As junky and hammy as the ABC teaser trailer preceding it.,"Lots of high-speed banter only adds to the superficiality of this dopey soap about vain, DC public relations folks who manage to find the handful of innocent victims in that den-of-iniquity vicinity. Conservative, closeted gays is a hint of the mundane exploitation factors in store. It's a tiresomely episodic potboiler perfectly suited for commercial breaks - and star Kerry Washington's hammy, overbearing performance is worth interrupting. It's definitely a show best watched by adolescents on handheld devices where they can annoy other people around them (airports, work, internet cafes, the backseat of the family van, any suburban hellhole will do). It's part of the continuing crap popping up lately on the Disney corporate network."
4,Why make me pay?,"Good ep. Wonder why it was the only one from Season 1 that was not available free on-line? Without it, there are holes in the story line."
4,"Fantastic, but short","Great show, layered storyline, incredible characterization - but too short! Only 2 DVDs feels like cheating. And gotta say, the main character is a bit weaker in this first season than I would like - here's hoping she comes back strong! Definitely buying the next season."
5,Leaves You Breathless,Scandal Season 1 is great! Leaves you on the edge of you seat and breathless. Can't wait to see more
5,"The series Scandal is so good, it is scandalous!","Olivia, Fitz, and the President's Chief of Staff character are all excellent actors and they all deserve awards for outstanding acting. The love scenes between Olivia and Fitz are both breathtaking and spellbinding!!!! I love it!!!!"
5,Great!!!!!!!,Love love love scandal so much bought a copy for my Mom can't wait for the second season to go on sale
4,First season of Scandal,We felt short-changed. There were very few episodes and two of them we had already seen. We love Scandal. It is our favorite show right now.
5,Addictive!!!,During a lunch break I overheard co workers discussing the series and I decided to order the series. I watched the first season of Scandal and I LOVED IT!!! I recommend the series for those who enjoys a great series full of drama!
5,Scandal: the complete first season,I have watch the program on TV but there were episodes I had missed and this caught me up todate. I need the second complete season so let me know when you have it.
5,awesome,Awesome show!! I could not stop watching it. I can not wait for season 2 to come out on DVD.
5,raised the hair on my neck...& then bit into it!!!,"i can't stop thinking about that creepy bathtub scene. if i never take a bath again it will be too soon. if you don't see this movie, you will have missed a great time!!! go find it. blockbuster sells it on the web as well as amazon."
1,Nooooo! This is Trash!,"After all of the good reviews one would expect something other than the standard low budget drivel that is rapidly infecting the urban vampire genre. This was a very dissapointing film. Sweeny is excellent, and deserves a star, but's that's a far as the quality of this film goes. Rather telling is the fact that the vampiress on the cover never appears in the film. The whole film's is like that, pent up expectations which are never relieved. Aside from some courtesy shots of the Manhattan skyline, the whole film could have been shot in Gary Indiana for all we know. To see the way a vampire movie like this should be executed, check out Fessenden's ""Habit"" which pulls you into the city fabric and character's desolation in a way that this film sadly does not."
5,TOMMY SWEENEY IS MY DREAM GUY!!!,"I'm sooo in love with Tommy--- I don't know what to do! Does anyone know how I can get in touch with him??? If you do, please leave the info on this web site!!! By the way, the movie was great. The best scene was when he killed Evan the bad vampire.---Kelly D. Buffalo,NY"
2,stupid,"Again I find these old SRK films to be stupid, but as a SRK fan I want to watch all his films, My favorite forever is Rab ne bana di Jodi and My Name is khan"
1,NOT A HAPPY CAMPER,"IM NOT PLEASED WITH THE AIR BED. THE COT ITSELF IS VERY HARD TO STAY OPEN WITHOUT A STRUGGLE, U HAVE TO USE SOMETHING TO KEEP THE LEGS OPEN OTHER WISE THEY MAY CLOSE UP ON U. HAD TO US TAPE TO KEEP THEM OPEN. THE MATTRESS ITSELF THE AIR EITHER SEEPS OUT OR THERES A SMALL HOLE SOMEWHERE U CANT FIND OUT HOW THE AIR IS GOING OUT. AGAIN NOT A HAPPY CAMPER."
2,If you weigh over 100 pounds dont order,It is okay for a extra bed for company but my son slept on it and he weights 89 lbs and the rails bent that holds the cot part up would never purchase again would never let a adult sleep on it.
3,Worth the price but not perfect,"We purchased 2 of these complete beds. The cot is sturdy but takes 2 people to keep it set up properly. It reminded me of the cartoon cots that folded the sleeper inside it! The mattress squeeks when you roll over and would benefit with a flocked liner like other air beds. The size was generous and the mattress stayed firm for several nights. For the price, we got what we expected."
2,Try the mattress before you go camping.,"This bed looked like the perfect answer for a camper who has difficulty getting up off the floor of the tent. However, we didn't test the mattress before we went camping and found that the mattress leaked! Coleman is willing to replace it, but not in time for days of discomfort camping on a cot that is incredibly uncomfortable without a mattress."
4,Functional but missing storage capability,"Purchased 3 sets for camping. Like overall functionality. Easy set up. When taken down, no way to tight everything up. Had to buy a rope with clip seperately to restrain everything together. Wish Coleman had built in a clip tide or provide a case for the cover and air bed."
3,Great handbook for leftists,"This is a fun and often surprising look at the U.S. and world economies done in a fun USA TODAY graph style. The range it covers is so wide that I'm often left with further questions about the stats, but that's to be expected. This is a great handbook and jumping off point. Who would think a book on economics would be a page turner?Most damning statistic: our country's per person spending on health care is higher than all those with socialized health care, yet our life expectancy is one of the lowest of industrialized countries."
5,An ideal survey for the non-specialist general reader.,"Field Guide to the U.S. Economy blends humor with an observation of the U.S. economy, examining complex economic scenarios and putting together the collective work and humor of over forty progressive economists affiliated with the Center for Popular Economics at Amherst University. Light reading, filled with important points, and ideal for the non-specialist general reader."
1,TOTAL HOGWASH,"I guess that is why we live in the ""Land of The Free"" and have the privledge of the ""Freedom of the Press"". This woman odviously has some bias agenda that has no foundation for the truth. My Grandmother served and participated in the Eastern Star for decades. She was a simple religious Baptist woman who enjoyed the fellowship of this organization and serving her community. No spooky hidden agendas here. I say to the the author - ""anything for a buck"" You are providing information that is false, misleading and odviously you have some twisted perception of the Eastern Star!"
1,Is this about OES or Masonry?,"The author spends more time talking about Masonry than OES. The author is going in circles, trying to turn every event in past history to being paganistic (when the basis of most Christian holidays are paganistic - not to mention the names of the days of the week, the months of the year) and anti-Christian. The beauty of these organizations is to promote fellowship without religion, politics or race being a barrier. Even those who were quoted are not considered to be authentic sources for ritual history."
4,Amazingly researched and documented.,"One negative is that this book at times seems to deal with Freemasonry more than OES. But then again it's understandable why the author had to spend so much time on the Freemasonry angle. A key part of this book is to show that OES and Freemasonry are intimately connected. Then she shows that Masonry has demonic/occult roots, thus OES also has occultic/demonic roots by being an outgrowth of Freemasonry.The parts that deal mainly with OES are interesting. But the parts dealing with the occultic roots of Freemasonry are absolutely riveting. The book's hundreds of footnotes show that the author put a lot of effort into putting this book together.Of course, hardcore masons and the like will hate this book for the most part. Those who are open enough to read this book from cover to cover might find this book eye-opening, as I did. This book is written from a Christian , anti-Masonic perspective, so those coming from that perspective will find this book most useful."
1,Do Not Buy on Editorial Description!,"if you are looking for an unbias book of information on the Eastern Star -THIS IS NOT IT!!! For all the fundamental Christians -you will thoroughly enjoy this book as it tries to make every symbol -a link to satanic forces very similar to ""The Church Lady"" character on Saturday Night Live. I bought this book based on the editorial review and was very disappointed."
1,GARBAGE!,"I really think that the few people who left positive reviews must be friends or family of the author. This book is such garbage. As far as good research, I could google better than this. There are plenty of people who hate freemasonry that write what they ""think"" they know on the ineternet for free. Why pay for this? Ultimately, I showed it to some people who knew better and they giggled and said that's funny."
1,WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am sooooooooooooo disappointed. This book is very ANTI-Masonic, which figures. Everyone fears what they don't understand or OVERALL don't know. This author needs to but her ANTI-Masonic views into something good like figuring out how to END GLOBAL WARMING!!!"
3,good book.... but preachy author,"This book is full of valuable information, good key points and the sources are well cited. On the downfall, it is written from a strong religious perspective. The author goes so far as to deem the new age movement, wicca, or anything that doesn't have to do with god as ""evil"". Like annoying bible salesmen that keep returning to your door, the author keeps returning to the idea that ""this is good, and that is evil"". If the reader can get past that notion and focus on the subject itself it's a good book."
3,Tough to follow but informative,"The book is a very difficult read. It is hard to follow who saids what. There is too much detail given about too many people. The added details makes it difficult to decipher the confusion behind the life of Jackie Wilson. However, there is some good information pertaining to this great star that any fan would find enlightening. I'm glad it was written, we need more books about Jackie Wilson, but I wish it would have stayed focus on the man himself instead of giving us so much detail of the lives of the people surrounding him."
1,Pathetic,"An incoherent string of contradictory and incomplete anecdotes that reveal nothing of the man, and nothing of the beautiful music he made. There is a great story to be told about Jackie Wilson. This isn't it."
3,The package label says it IS vegan...not that I care.,"The label says its vegan on my package...but I wanted REAL chicken!There is some discussion on whether hydrolyzed protein contains MSG or not.My point is if hydrolyzed protein doesn't cause a toxic reaction like MSG then why put it in? Are U telling me that Cornstarch,salt,sugar,natural flavor, parsley, onion, and spice extractives(there spelling)are not enough to make broth? Why the NEED for hydrolyzed protein? Unless its ACTING like MSG then why put it in? It would be a better product with out it. Just about every vegan tree hugging hippy bum wants clean food, Just about every conservative bible thumper wants clean food, so why not leave it out and make 99.9% of the free world happy?"
2,Break out your Blood Pressure Monitor.,"Great for a chicken cooking SALTY spice but as a soupbase this makes Lipton, Manderian Noodle Soup and Campbells taste almost like fresh water. I love my salt but this powder made me pucker for a kissing contest."
1,NOT VEGETARIAN,"I don't know whose idea it was to list this as a return for a search on ""vegetarian bouillon,"" but it is very misleading since the broth is NOT VEGETARIAN!"
3,ggt,Nobel Prize? I don't think so. Mr Sher took what could have been a wonderful story and hid it behind vile vernacular diaglogue that is impossible to read much less follow. Perhaps it would have been easier to understand in an audio version. The written form was horrible. No wonder there are so many used copies being offered for less than $1.00.
2,It says 8 on description. I got one,I expected 8 bulbs and got just one. I'm very disapointed. Very expensive. I could have bought it locally for less. I'm wondering when I would be getting the other seven bulbs.
1,Didn't grab me....,"I ordered this book after reading about it in 'Eat, Pray, Love'. I scanned the book when it came in the mail but did not interest me enough to read. The quality of the writing/editing did not seem to be of a very high standard."
4,Nice Little Tribute...,"...to the American way of life in but one state of the union. The prior 'reviewer' sounds more like someone who got snubbed and didn't get their pictures in the book. I think this series is an interesting snapshot of American life during one week of 2003. Each image tells a different story, and although I can't presume to know how they chose the images, the fact that the images were shot by amateurs who weren't paid royalties is mostly irrelevant. How many family snapshots have you ever sold to a publisher for a coffee table photography book? None! Take it for what it's worth: it's a collection of images shot by a collection of average Americans who are not priveleged enough to be paid as photographers. The fact that most of them are not professional does not in the least detract from the imagery in the books, despite whatever advertising may be contained in the last page."
3,Not bad just not good.,"On the cover of this movie it says ""One of the 100 best Mexican movies of all time"". I certainly don't agree. It's not that it's a bad movie it's just not good. But then if you sit through the first 20 minutes you know this.I'm all for character development, but develop the character, don't just linger over images of them. Throughout this movie my fiancee got up regularly, left the room and came back to discover that nothing had happened in the interim.There are many shots of nudity, some of it even seeming a bit gratuitous. If you're offended by this don't bother as they are sprinkled throughout the movie. But then if you're bothered by that sort of thing why are you watching a movie that starts out with incest?The only extra the DVD has is filmographies for the three main characters and the director. Also the translation on this disc is way off in some spots (""Senor"" does not translate to ""God"", ""know"" and ""now"" are different in English, Etc.)."
2,Not his best effort,John Patrick usually has much more content in his videos. This was more of a how to play video. If you have played the game before save your money.
5,Awesome,This vegetable broth powder is like magic. It makes the best stews and soups! I do not let it run out in my kitchen.
1,Awful company to do business with,I had a terrible experience ordering from this company.Customer service treated me like a criminal.
1,Spanish translator,"We bought this to use as a supplement, but it has not been that helpful. The program itself is not the fastest way to work within documents. If you are barely fluent this may be for you, but you have an advanced level of Spanish, you probably do not need it."
5,Oh such memories this brings back. Love it.,"I havent heard this albulm since I was a little girl, the memories just came flooding back. It was the better days. Thanks alot for the memories."
4,Jezebel Spirit,"I do not want to review the book, I need information on getting this book and others from the Bilbo's"
2,Not well made,"I've had 2 of these--the first was replaced by store (reluctantly) after handle broke off within a month. The replacement's handle broke off after a couple of years of daily use. The handle gets very hot and requires a potholder, and the bottom of the pot is a little narrow, slightly rounded and teeters on my gas burner if I don't place it just exactly right. I'd rather not deal with these potential safety hazards, especially before I've had my morning caffeine!"
3,Early Glastonbury Festival,"The world-famous Glastonbury Festival started in 1970 as Pilton Pop, Blues & Folk Festival. It was the English version of Woodstock with plenty of naked hippies tripping out in the mud. This CD set documents the second Glastonbury Fayre in 1971. Many of the tracks are not live.The main reason to get this set is for the extremely rare Pete Townshend studio track ""Classified"". The live tracks are poorly recorded. There was even a power failure during Gong's set. The bonus DVD also suffers from budgetary constraints and is low quality audio and video.[DW]"
4,Heads Up...,"I like these coasters, and had waited a while to purchase them. I was surprised to see that the colors were very bold.... mostly a dark, orangish red without much color variation. The picture shows variance, and some purple. Mine were all the same, bold color. Not as nice looking as I'd hoped.Also: one came broken, unfortunately. They were shipped in a padded envelope, which I don't feel is appropriate.Any questions? Drop a note, and I'll be happy to get back to you.Enjoy!"
4,Thirstystone coaters,"This is not my first set of Thirsty stone coasters. They are great, and this design brightens up the room too."
4,"""BAD"" Lizzie","Enjoyed the book. Followed the timeline closely. Not much new to what has been written over and over. The conclusion remains the same.... Lizzie was ""probably"" guilty! We'll never know. Bottom line. Would recommend to all followers of true crime."
1,Poor quality control,"I have not finished the book, but from what I have read I would not suggest the book to Anglos unless they are very open minded as the book is definitely a frontal assault on those of European ancestry. That said, what was very disappointing was the lack of care by the publishers. The cover of the book is on backwards and upside down. That is totally inexcusable by a publisher."
4,A must have,"My discs are so scratched and damaged that it was time to replace them, easier to just get all three in a set. Plus you get the extra tracks, I love Stick By Me. Worth it, then they always are aren't they? Love the UB's"
4,UB40's Best,"LABOUR OF LOVE I, II & III is a great way to have some of the best of UB40's covers.As usual, the band delivers the goods."
4,UB40 Set,Although LAbour of Love 2 is my all time favorite the other two discs did not disappoint either. Definately a good buy.
3,Interesting read,"I am a great fan of Modesty Blaise books and was plesantly surprised to discover only recently that the author has also written books under the pseudonym of Madeline Brent. I immediatly bought a few books penned under this name and though these books are not as great as the Modesty Blaise series which I adore, I did enjoy them."
5,A story you don't forget. Totally unique.,I loved this story and the adventure was top rate. Brent writes the best heroines and this girl was tops. You also get the tortured but honorable hero in this story. Every character is written exquisitely! I have rarely read such a charming tale.
2,Disappointed,"Was excited to get this but haven't found it to be as useful as i thought. Should have probably gotten the larger size as this one is very difficult to hang on to..even if you are quick enough to get your hands to the right place, its hard to latch on to it..and to be honest its a little bit too uncontrolled where we seem to spend more time fetching it vs. using it to improve reflexes! maybe just using it the wrong way but hasn't worked out for me."
2,Where are the spare parts??,"I bought this machine a couple years ago and I am pleased with the quality of pasta it produces. However, the plastic parts are now cracking and I can't find a source for replacement parts. The plastic bowl is falling apart and the gray colored extrusion chamber now has a large crack and will fail shortly. The Delonghi web site offers no replacement parts. I was able to find one other web site that sells only the bowl, but no other parts. I guess I will now be searching for a new machine. I will buy one from a company that supports the customers by offering replacement parts (not Delonghi)."
2,mis-represented list price,"I am just shopping for a new pasta machine since my Popeil machine's gears, made of plastic, broke. DeLonghi sells this machine for $199 at their own website so I don't know how Amazon says it lists for $420. Amazon tends to have inflated list prices, in my experience. Sounds like the reviewer who said it was a good price compared to other sites was mistaken, or maybe the price has dropped because the machine is not worth more. My KitchenAid pasta attachment extrudes pasta that sticks together unless you dust pounds of flour on it as it comes out. Sounds like that's what the DeLonghi does, according to the one good review here. The metal gears on this one sound like they would solve the problem of plastic gears breaking easily, but not according to another reviewer whose machine broke."
1,Just for show,"This waffle maker is made to be seen not used. While the features are impressive, removable trays for waffles and flat trays for sandwiches, temperature control, beeping alarm, vertical storage option and an on/off switch. It's also reasonably priced with above average looks, that's the good.Here's the bad the beeping alarm is hardly audible it can hardly be heard in a quite house let alone a kitchen with something frying.. While making waffles cooking is uneven and frequently results in the waffles sticking to the top and bottom when the iron is opened unless liberal amounts of oil are used. They elected to use a low grade non-stick surface. Even on the highest setting the waffles come out uneven while lower setting result in uncooked mix. They are also just slightly thicker than the store bought toaster waffles."
3,A Good Start,"This is a book I wish had existed a generation ago. It had high and low points. The high points were the voice of acceptance that was being given to explaining Asperger's, which is a neurological condition on the autism spectrum to children. It is a good starter book for sharing with children on the spectrum who continue coping with ""undefined differences.""One thing that bothered me was that the writing suggested a ""uniform, one size fits all"" approach and description of Asperger's. This can be misleading to readers. Still, it was a good faith effort and one that can be used to empower children on the spectrum and explain their ""differences"" in a clear cut, humane and frank way."
1,One perspective,"Each person with Aspergers is unique and wonderful. This book was disappointing because it makes generalizations when there is not a ""cookie-cutter"" description that fits across the board. My husband and I read it first and decided not to share it with our 7-year old Asperger child because most of it would be more confusing than enlightening."
3,Aspergers Huh?,"This wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it was still good. I found I needed to read it to my child. It did explain a lot of words that these kids are dealing with eg ""social"", ""flexibility"", ""adaptable"", ""appropriate"". It's written as a story told by an 11yr boy and his understanding of AS."
5,A must read,"A fun read about a growing problem, especially for boys. Copies of this book should be on the shelves of at least every upper elementary and middle school library. It's a good read for adulls as well."
2,Yuckie Yuckie,I loved Hawkman as a child growing up in the 60's. he was my favorite member of the JLA. I got this book to share some memories with my 8 year old but beheadings are a little too gross for me. I guess I'll try to find a Classic Anthology with some reprints from a simplar time.
5,"Classic, clasic","I have bought this album three now. In record, tape and now CD. My favorite. Fast delivery. Excellent condition. Thanks"
5,The first LP Album I bought!,"I had to save for three weeks all my allowance and all the money I could find to purchase this album when I was 15. I gave it as a a present to my then girlfriend, now my wife of 47 years, the vinyl thinned almost to transparency from playing, the CD is still playing but I have to find it; now with the MP3 on the computer Ray's music accompanies me every time I am on the computer. I loved his music then and I still do...Ray Conniff forever!!!!!!"
3,Just touched the surface of the problem; too many personal testimonies,"As a Christian woman, I was hoping this book would really help with my problem of overspending, but it didn't! I don't even plan to finish reading the last 60 pages of the book. I'm looking for a book that goes more into depth on how to solve the problem, and I personally don't believe 12 step programs are the key to solving shopping addictions. Had I known this book so heavily relied on testimonies, I would not have purchased it."
5,History the way it was meant to be written,"Loved it. History written in bold strokes, with just right amount of nuance. Stands miles apart (and in front of) all the silly overly political modern scholarship that is fueled by pettty political biases instead of a passion for truth.Great stuff.Remini rocks."
5,love andrew jackson,love andrew jackson and this book was a request to read and i am now using him in my classroom for a unit
3,Not Remini's best work.,"This book has a lack of cohesiveness to it that leaves the reader (well, me at least) feeling like they have just read somebody's high school term paper rather than an authoritative text on Jackson. To be sure, he knows his subject matter, but there is too much editorializing and trivialty and not enough organization. Anyway, no hard feelings, Mr. Remini; I bought it in paperback."
2,There must be something better than this,"As an avid reader of historical biographies and history - my favorite author is Paul Johnson - I found this book to be a biased piece of work, written in the most narrow style. No doubt the author spent time on his subject, thus the two stars, but his personal views (interjected throughout the text) were offensive and unnecessary tripe. I am a Jackson fan and I believe that he is a true important American hero to be admired and understood IN HIS TIME. So often authors are biased from a position of their own era - which surprises me since historical happenings must be viewed relative to the era in which they occurred. I also read New Orleans 1815 by Tim Pickles: another book that was written with the author's bias. I got the book to pass on to the kids, but thought that I would read it first. I definately won't pass it on. I am still searching for a good Jackson book."
1,An unresonable and biased view,"ALthough his writing is fair, I have found Mr. Remini to be a biased bigot who injects Jacksons already tarnished character with further polution. Not a fan of Jackson myself, I am appaled by Reminis worshipful attitude. Any author that encourages the annihilation of the ""savages"" (Indian) does not belong in the 21st century, and his books do not deserve to be on paper. Remini fails sorofully when tring to excuse Jacksons shortcoming and inflate his victories. I give one star for his mediorcor writing ability, and none for content."
5,A Secret worth sharing with everyone...,"My Secret Bully by Trudy Ludwig is a well written and extremely useful story for both teachers and parents to have on their shelves. On the one hand it offers great insight into the experience of a child who is being emotionally bullied, allowing adult readers to see it through a young victim's eyes to better identify and connect with children who are dealing with relational aggression. On the other, it is a story a parent/teacher can read with a child they believe is being emotionally bullied to assist them in dealing with their situation, or with an entire classroom to create awareness as a means for preventing the behavior. This is a major issue in schools today and Trudy Ludwig certainly demonstrates that she is one of the foremost experts on the subject. Through smart storytelling, she brings a creative and informative approach to a difficult topic with a book that can equally benefit children as well as the adults that care for them."
4,Don't Keep a Bully a Secret,"Again, well done. Too often children, and even adults, are affected more than we realize by bullies. I bought all three of her books after seeing the author's school presentation. Thank you Amazon for having these books available through your many book dealers. My copies were in good condition and arrived quickly."
3,Too simple,"After reading all the postivie reviews, I bought this book for my daughter who is in 2nd grade and already struggling with bullies. I thought there would be some good techniques to help her deal with it. The book is good but the story is too simple. I realize it is targeted to a younger reader, but it could be more useful had they shown different approaches and possible outcomes, making it a little more realistic."
5,Great discussion starter,I read this to a group of kids ranging from age 6 years to 12 years. It got the discussion about bullying started and then gave great ways to deal with bullying. I think it helped to instill confidence it ways to stand up to a bully. The kids did great in standing up for themselves in practice scenarios after discussing this book.
1,duplicate order,I was very disappointed that somehow it became a duplicate order and I notified amazon and the distributor but was still charged for 2.
3,Not to bad machine,"I buy this last year for 70$ from Target, it was been good machine for the price but after 8 months stop making cream on the espresso and no matter what coffee and technique I use I cant make it to do cream anymore. I'm going to buy new one... may be Capresso this time"
2,Good for the price,"My old machine bit the dust and I needed a quick replacement. Ran across this one at a local department store and it looked good. Seemed to be well made and was pump driven so I bought it and took it home.Took a couple of test runs and it quickly became obvious that the cup that holds the espresso is too small. I was only able to pull a single shot at a time at full strength. I could get a double shot but it was weak.I thought maybe I just needed to experiment so for the next week I experimented with different grinds, tamping, etc.. Nothing really made a difference, the cup is just too small for a double shot.In fairness, if I ran it twice to produce a double shot, it did great. But that was too much work for me so I returned it and bought a Via Venezia Espresso Machine By Saeco from Starbucks. It was twice the amount but has a standard size cup and works great."
4,A Great Machine for thr Price,I bought this espresso machine because I wanted a decent machine at a fair price. This machine did not disappoint. It makes great espresso and cappuccino. The espresso has perfect crema every time due to the unique design by delonghi. The steamer is the only thing that could be a little better but if you pre-warm the cup it makes it a little quicker. I have seen more expensive machines that do not work nearly as well as this one.
4,Great latte maker.,"Great machine, This is my second one. The first made unknown cups of great Lattes and lasted years. It made a trip to Hawaii and back. It finally died but I have no regrets. The second one functions just a well and has a few improvements. It had a little crack in a unimportant area. Not due to shipping as the box was in great shape. It had to happen at the factory. No way am I going to send it back. Great latte's and liked Amazons price and shipping. I can live with a little crack. (:>}"
2,Broken Part and no Customer Service from deLonghi,"As a long-time home espresso brewer, I was delighted to receive the EC140B as a holiday 2004 gift. It was a nice upgrade from my existing machine.Well, it's been less than 2 months and I'm glad I didn't toss the old machine when I got the deLonghi because without it I'd have no morning brew. The rubber grommet that holds the screen snugly within the filter head has completely fallen apart rendering the EC140B unuseable for want of this little piece of rubber.I've visited deLonghi's website, but it's incomplete (doesn't appear to have been updated since it went online in March 2004) and the Customer Service phone number in the documentation that came with the machine is ""No longer in service."" I'm willing to accept a percentage of product failure, but deLonghi can't or won't stand behind their product quality. Beware."
3,"good for a while, but not forever","I've owned this machine for 6 years. I found that I needed to set it to the highest temp setting to get a decent crema, which probably contributed to the machine failure that occurred recently - water leaks out through the bottom of the boiler, and the entire thing is shot. It was a great buy at the time - I paid $70 for it because of a store marking error. I don't know that I would buy another one."
1,Not enough heat,"Machine never produced enough hot water to make espresso. After a few seconds of hot water or steam, the steam would lose pressure or the espresso would go lukewarm and then pump out simulated crema."
2,Had a bit of a struggle,"I admit to being cappucino-maker impaired, and admittedly our DeLonghi was mis-wired which contributed to the problem, but it took longer than it should have to realize we weren't the problem because the instructions were not that clear to us. The steamer nozzle did work, though, and what beautiful foam it made rather quickly compared to my old Melitta."
1,don't buy,"Bought it last week in the ""Target"" store because of the price and many positive reviews here. Came back home, unpacked it and found the water container broken. Went back to the ""Target"", they replaced it with another one. Came back home, made a very good cup of espresso each morning for 5 days, but noticed that the pump for frothing worked poorly - today after five days only since I bought this machine the pump died completely, the steam was built up inside but could not be released by turning the release button (yes, I cleaned everything after each use, I have been using espresso machines before). I am on my way now to return it to the store. I am considering purchasing a better quality machine once I can afford it."
5,This machine is a very good investment!,"I brought this machine 3 years ago. I have very good service with this machine. I make two (double)espressos some times more if I have friends over ... I am still in love with this machine and may be you should trust my opinion ... and each cup is the same excellent (I am using regular Melita espresso brand or Lavazza ""Espresso"").This machine is a very good investment!"
3,MAY BE CARAMEL COLORED BUT NOT AT ALL CREAMY,"While this was touted as making the true espresso - a creamy caramel colored liquid which is the epitome of true espresso - tain't so. Crema, as many will agree, is not true espresso.Nonetheless, not being one to quibble about an over enthusiastic press release, we gave it a try. In fact, several tries and then returned to our old espresso maker. The used grounds weren't removed but settled nice ly into our glasses, and the temperature gauge is testy to say the least.Caio to this!"
2,Not a good buy after all,"This product was sent to the wrong address-- one that was on file with Amazon and even tho I filled in the correct address it was changed in transition to the vendor. Be very sure to double check the address on your order when it is confirmed! As to the product, I was replacing a espresso machine that I have had for 4 yrs and this is the exact duplicate of my original so I would have to say that I am very happy with the product especially for the price. Now I just have to wait until I get to the address it was sent to to be able to use it. Amended review is that it lasted one year of use and the frothing wand started leaking. That happened to the first one too only it took three years to happen so no I won't be getting another one and I don't recommend the model."
1,Is there a ZERO star available???,"I do not own this particular machine but was compelled to write after laughing at another review...the person stated that he tried to contact customer service and left a message and never got a call back...I laughed because two years ago I received a Delonghi coffee pot as a gift (therefore I had no receipt). The pot was defective. I couldn't exchange it cuz I had looked for them but didn't know where it had been purchased. So, I decided to go straight to the source...Delonghi. They were hard to deal with and are not customer-oriented (read: the customer is NOT always right). They would not replace their defective merchandise. Bottom line: I would never buy a Delonghi again based on principle alone."
5,So far so yummy!,I just bought this for my husband for Father's Day and we love it. It works best with espresso ground coffee. I am pleased with the size and the power.
1,Too Weak for me,"I really wanted to love this machine. The frother worked great and it was easy to use and clean. However, after trying and trying, and using up lots of espresso beans, the result was very weak coffee. Not espresso at all. Returning."
2,Tough to froth,"While this maker does a decent job of making a good tasting smooth espresso, it's not so hot (well, it's too hot, actually) when trying to make a cappuccino. No matter what I tried, it steams milk up before it's done frothing it. I used to own a cheapo Mr. Coffee machine for the past 7 years with the sub-par 8 bar pressure, and while espresso wasn't nearly as good as from this DeLonghi's machine, it was a breeze to froth a milk, even though it used a cheap rubber slip-on wand. I think the problem may lie in the strangely wide shape of the DeLonghi's steam wand, and I consistently wind up with lattes instead of cappuccinos."
4,Good Expresso Maker,"I've had this expresso maker for about six months. I use it every day to make at least two lattes. It performs well and makes as good a shot as the other expresso machines I've had. I've had no problems keeping it clean.At first I was concerned with the plastic foam nozzle. I thought the threads would strip, but they have not. I take the nozzle off after each use and run under water to clean it. About once a week I soak it in hot water to clean it throughly.One small problem is that the foamer is fairly close to the side of the machine. When water or milk drips off of it, it tends to get under the machine. I place a cloth under the foam head to catch drips and make clean up easier."
1,"Inadequate Performance, Breaks, 3-Month Replacement","The first one I got had a broken case, obviously broken when it went in the box. Amazon sent a new one immediately.Produces something approaching espresso. Always ran out of hot water when brewing one shot. Always ran out of steam when steaming 6 oz of milk, preheated to 100 degrees.The steam valve gave out after a month. Sent it in for warranty service; it's unrepairable and replacement will take about three months.I've ordered a real $200 espresso machine and when the replacement DeLonghi finally arrives I'll have a light-duty, backup not-quite-espresso machine."
3,Works for me...,"I bought a bar 140 (almost the same machine, but the older version) about 18 months ago. After struggling to make some decent coffee, I decided to try the ESE pods. I wish I had tried them from the beginning! A perfect shot each time. The drawback is that I have to make my double shots separately, but it doesn't take much more time. I bought this unit used for around $45 and have easily gotten my money's worth.However, as seems to be symptomatic with the lower end Delonghi machines, there are mornings when I wander into the kitchen to find a large puddle on my counter and the water tank empty. The machine is off, yet it still leaks all over the place. It seems to be coming from the filter basket area, because the drip tray is overflowed as well. My solution has been to not fill the water tank and fill it up each morning. It still makes a great latte and the steamer works great!"
3,It's a Big Ball,"Like other people said here. Amazon's description is wrong. The packaging is wrong. I think the other reviewer was very generous on giving the diameter at 36"" I measured it at 34"" fully inflated.Yes again the item I received looked nothing like the picture. The package has a correct picture of the ball patteren.Like most Wet Set Inflatables products there is no patch repair kit. I have enough of these to go around but still it should be included.Despite all the wrong information on this item. Its still a ball and a big ball and does what a big ball should. Toss around and have fun with it. Even though I feel cheated on 14"", I am still happy with this ball. 48"" would be a little too big. 2 stars were lost due to the above listed items."
2,Nowhere near 48 inches,"Several others have noted that their 48"" ball is only 32""...mine seems to be only 24"". I mean, that's still actually a pretty big ball, but nowhere near as big as i expected..."
4,Kids fun,I bought this item for the kids in our Kids Church on Sunday mornings as start up game like at ballgames. Works wonders as attention getter
3,48in Beach Ball,I bought this ball to make a paper mache halloween costume. It has held up so far but needs to be re-aired a bit every week. For the low price it has done the trick. As a sidenote it takes up more room than expected in my small apartment so you might consider storage; my dog is terrified of its size which provides more entertainment than the ball itself but overall a good buy.
4,It's beach ball......,It is a really big beach ball. The quality seems ok and it held air so I am happy.

3,'S Awful Nice,"The product was not received. However, after two months I sent an e-mail explaining this fact and my account was credited the next day. That's very good service."
3,Space bags hit or miss . . .,"I purchased the 4 bag combo set to provide seasonal storage for my clothing. As I have little to no free storage space in my home, I liked the idea of storing a lot in a small amount of space. The Medium-sized bags work just as they are supposed to work and I'm pleased with the way they hold their vaccuum seal and stay compressed. However, the larger bags in the set I purchased only hold their vaccuum compression for a few days before air seeps into them and they are as large as when they were filled with items. I followed the instructions on the bags, but apparently the larger bags in the set I purchased have defective air seals. I'm still happy with the bags in the set that do work properly. I just advise caution when purchasing this item, as the bags may or may not work the way they're supposed to work."
1,It is VERY DANGEROUS!,"I bought this model oven toaster about six months ago. I used it early this morning and it worked fine. Thirty minutes later, the front glass door just shattered and exploded. The shattered pieces were everywhere on the kitchen floor and on the dining table in the dishes. Fortunately, we just sent kids to school. Otherwise they would have been right in the line of explosion. I immediately called Delonghi and spoke to a rep by the name of DeLorne, who was very unfriendly and gave me hard time. I asked to speak with a supervisor. I was told none was avaible at that time. Upon my insistance, I was finally told someone by the name of Kelly would call me back. I am still waiting!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"The reviewer who castigated the other two reviews should consider himself lucky. He probably received one of the apparently good units Delonghi made.The lower 2 heating elements never worked on our machine. Toast making is a chore. Baking is out of the question. We took the unit to an authorized repair store and they quoted $80.00 plus tax to repair. That's almost the cost of the unit!A call to the company advised us that according to the serial number, the unit was 3 years old . We have had it for over a year. (We were unble to use it for more than 6 months) The unit was purchased from an ""on line"" store.Be careful, you will not know how old the unit is until you check the serial number with Delonghi. I don't know if this would affect the warranty, but check it out. Better safe than sorry.If you buy one, Good Luck!"
4,Classic Recipe,"This is a great tasting paste. You can truly tell the difference between the off-brand pastes and Elmer's. In an economy when manufacturers are making cuts in their products, Elmer's has continued their reputation as a provider of top-quality, great tasting pastes."
3,Doesn't glue well,"I like theElmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, but the Elmer's Washable No Run School Glue just doesn't do it for me. Sure, it's great that it washes off, but the glue just plain doesn't stick, at least not like the regular stuff. The only time it's good is if it's paper on paper and the project can lay flat to dry. If you need the slightest bit of tack, forget it. Everything will slide right off. That's frustrating for the kids.Great for large groups of kids, when you can't supervise well and don't want to ruin clothes and carpet. Otherwise, stick with the original."
2,Too hard to squeeze!!,"Hello? This is ""SCHOOL GLUE"". It was so hard to squeeze the glue out even for an adult that my child couldn't even begin to do it!I could hardly do it myself.Back to glue sticks and this goes back on the shelf!GAH!"
5,Love it,We got tired of renting these for parties and decided to just go ahead and buy one. Better than the one we rented for $25 a pop.
5,Works perfect!,I bought this for a friend who owns a bar. 2 years later its still there and works flawlessly. Can't complain
5,"A magical, thought-provoking journey","Like the Iberian peninsula of the title, the reader is swept along on an enchanting, mysterious voyage. Saramago's writing (unconventional in that it forgoes most punctuation) is never obtuse, always engrossing and often quite funny. Like all great writers --in my opinion -- he never sacrifices story while at the same time expressing his ideas. What could have easily been a polemic is instead a rich, lovely book. If you've never read Saramago, this is an ideal book with which to start."
3,"Prose, Excellent. Story Line, Torpid.","I concede that the writing is exquisite, the imagery splendid, however, the story itself was rather dry and somewhat painful. This reader had a hard time getting excited about this story."
2,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed in this book. It was like slogging through a swamp to get back to the same place you started. The story was a really interesting premise, but the discussion of politics and the destinationless and pointless journey bored me.I supposed there is some meaning somewhere in all the molecules of description, but my patience is too far gone to find it. I LOVED the Tale of the Unknown Island because it was direct but slow enough to keep me thinking there was something around the corner. This one just left me hanging."
2,"mildly clever, went nowhere","By way of a metaphor that's as subtle as a train wreck--the Iberian Peninsula shears off from the European land mass and starts floating out to sea--the Portuguese Nobelist Jose Saramago assays the isolation of Portugal and Spain from the rest of Europe and, for that matter, from the rest of the world. The new island drifts first towards America then South; at one point it rotates; but for the most part it just seems to be adrift. Of course, the oddest thing about all this is that the book was published just as Spain and Portugal were formally joining the European Community and officially ending their years in the wilderness.If Mr. Saramago has a coherent point here it was too nuanced for one as literal as I. And since I didn't much care for the group of characters that he follows, I did not care for the book. It seemed like a mildly clever idea for a short story that went nowhere and did so at too great length.GRADE : D+"
4,Practical tips for the art of retouching...,This book offers 'hands on' knowledge in a practical way. Just the right balance between theory and practice. It gets to the point yet also shares insight and tips about the more complex nuances of the retouching profession. Highly recommended.
5,Every graphic designer who works in Photoshop should own this book!,"I was very happy to finally find a Photoshop retouching book that I can keep at my fingertips and use regularly for my work as well as for my personal use.The book is very well organized and layed out. You can easily jump from chapter to chapter as needed. The step-by-step instructions supported with lots of coloured images are very easy to follow and understand. If you are a beginner or an advanced Photoshop user, you can greatly benefit from this book.I highly recommend it!"
4,"An empathetic, frustrating heroine","This is the story of Layla: a chain-smoking, lazy, self-educated, loyal, very real character. The story has been outlined in the other reviews, so I'll skip that.I found the character of Layla to be oft-times annoying. I wanted to yell at her - just DO something. Yet, as I got to know the character, the position she was in was more and more understandable. She's a pretty strong chick.There are great gothic qualities to this story, but the only romance, really, is between other characters in the book. The story is so rich, and the characters are fantastic.One thing that let me down was the ending. I really didn't understand it at all. But it didn't really matter. It was such a fun ride.(*)>"
2,"Nice socks but, they run small","The socks are very nice but should be labeled as size 10-12. My feet are size 12 and they barely go on. Hopefully, I can send them back. Maybe future customers can benefit if they read the reviews. I normally do."
2,"Has nothing to read, about McArthur after World War II","I read this short book,here in Brazil.This book has many photos; all of them, are black & white.This book became weak, when it doesn't shows nothing about McArthur's life after World War II.Before World war II end, this book is a regular work."
4,GOOD songs - repetitive arrangements,BESAME MUCHO gets the album off to a GREAT start. The other songs are all good but the arrangements are all very similiar and are probably intended for dancing.A fun album it is though.
4,Could have been made better...,"I love Paul Frank, especially Skurvy, so I ordered this ASAP when I saw them on Amazon. Unfortunately, it turns out it's really small, and the pleather ends fray after some time. I find myself picking off white thread from the handles every now and then. :("
4,No Longer Any Trouble,"Clive Gregson has very little resemblance to his Any Trouble past with this new recording. This is strong and lyricaly interesting work. It is all acoustic guitar with a piano here and there. But the main attractions are the lyrics and melodies on this well produced recording. You will not be humming these tunes to yourself, but you might very well share them with your friends. Overall, this is a very good recording and I'm more than peased to have purchased it."
2,Being Beck Hansen,"Poor Rob Jovanovic. Writing a celebrity bio of such a young guy must be tricky: how to tell the story without fawning, and what to say that might be worth reading a year from now. But this book is prosaic and tendentious, meandering pointlessly: the exact antithesis of Beck's songs.The book is also irrelevant, except for the most gaga of fans. Beck tells his own story captivatingly. He connects with his listeners, not always emotionally, but in some dark, smokey recess of the brain. What more can his audience expect?"
5,"Uh, ""magical""?","...this is a tale involving drugs and prostitution. One ought not expect Pollyanna to appear in the dramatis personae.This is, indeed, a genre-breaker--certainly *not* a love story, certainly not (entirely) a mystery. The incessant exploration of what is real and what is illusion is what drives this wonderfully introspective tome ceaselessly forward. One is never quite certain who is deceiving whom.Most books fade from consciousness with nary a whimper. Not this one."
2,"Less of a mystery, more of a drama","The Kirkus review said it well a ""...maudlin tale of love and loss, Bedford offers a promising yet finally disappointing story..."" I was hoping for a mystery, instead I found a drama - a soap opera. I found the ending to be anticlimatic and somewhat depressing.If you have read Bedford before, you may enjoy this too, but if you have never read Bedford in the past, I would not recommend this as an introduction to his work. If you want a mystery, definitely look elsewhere."
1,filthy trash,"Don't recall who suggested I read this. Best I don't remember. This book is an exercise in how many times the f word (or English equivalent) could be used. Absolutely pointless rather quickly. The insight into a magician and his tricks kept me going for a while. But I never finished the book. Got too tired of all the trash. Yes, heard these words before BUT we all have limits. I look for good literature- this trash doesn't qualify. And the sad part is that this may have been a good yarn with a little effort."
3,An enjoyable read...,"...but not terribly memorable. Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, but not a great one. I read it a few weeks ago, and looking back, it hasn't left much impact."
4,Not Your Common Love Story,"For the puritanical readers out there, stay away. This book takes you to a place few others do in a most interesting way. There is nothing sleazy about this book and all the swearing and subject matter are about very real people that inhabit a different terrain than the average Joe and Jill. This is a journey into someone's dark side and the accompanying grieving process told in a very unique way. The only weak point to the story was the subject's obsession with someone not that interesting to me."
2,Interesting detail stamped on a who cares plot,"When it sticks to discourses on the magician's art, this is a fun, fascinating read. When it gets down to plot and character, it fizzles severely. A major disappointment."
2,If Houdini's Girl disappeared - would anyone care?,"After a tantalizing start this wound its way downhill. Something between a mystery and a soap opera, a reader better like the f--- word. (He seemed to use the word as an incompetent comedian would for its shock value.) In particular the ending was disappointing, although the original premise had promise."
1,look elsewhere,"i bought this grinder three months ago for espresso bean grinding. this grinder is a triumph of appearance over function:1. the coffee bin must be fully filled with beans each time you want to grind a single serving, because the shape of the bin does not allow for small quantities of beans to adequately feed into the grinder.2. the chute where the ground coffee dispenses into the container clogs easily and often. you have to tap the machine on the countertop to keep the grounds moving.3. the coffee grounds form a nice static electric charge against the plastic container. they adhere to the inside of the container, and entertainly enough will collectively spring out of the container if it is tapped or bumped after grinding.4. i used it up to four occasions per week, and after three months it no longer functions at all. after having learned to work through all of its quirks and oddities, it broke on me."
1,chokes after a few uses,"This grinder being my first, I don't have much comparison data. At first, the grinder seemed to do its job fairly well. Frequently, the grinder would make this jammed-sound, which could often be fixed with some firm tapping. Eventually, the grinder just jammed and stopped working. Since it's a burr grinder, it's hard to get to the actual grinder to clean it out without soaking the whole thing in water, which the instructions advise you not to do."
1,What a dreadful piece of equipment,"This is a terribly designed machine. It almost invariably clogs on use, and the part that clogs isn't removable, so every single morning I have to unplug the machine, carry it over to the sink, and use a narrow knife to unclog the little output chute thing. It's also an extremely messy machine, and requires major cleanup of the surrounding area with every use. Way too much static as well. This machine has ruined my previously-pleasant morning coffee-making experience. I'm pitching it."
2,They should have designed it better,I have two main complaints (and will spare you the others).1)You have to keep your finger on the button all the time that it is grinding (and it is very slow).2)The coffee grinds very unevenly.What a dumb design!
2,Mostly Unusable,"The review that mentions shaking the beans is correct. It is quite messy as well. All the interlocks can sometimes prevent the operation of it. Removing the top burr to clean it is difficult. The part I don't like is the space that leads from the burr wheels to the storage chamber constantly clogs if you use beans that have any visable oil to them. I like that kind of coffee. If you use mostly light roasted dry beans, it may be OK. I clean the thing well and attempt to grind coffee and it is clogged before I have enough for a single cup brewer! I suppose I could clean it out several times during a grinding, but that is also very messy and is the last thing I want to do in the morning when I want some fresh brewed coffee. It sits on my counter taking up space. I may give it to a charity like Goodwill or just trash it."
2,you get what you pay for,"The cheapest burr grinder I found.PROSo RUGGED! I am using & abusing it in IRAQ!o A decent upgrade from a blade grinderCONSo Needs to be cleaned 2 or 3 times per round of grinding clogs easilyo Static electricity causes ginds to ""spring"" from the catch basket, it's messy!o Plastic container catch basket clumsy designo needs to be shaken gently while grinding to keep beand flowing from the hopper to grinding chamberWorks fine in the field (military). I'll buy a better one when I get home!"
5,Fantastic!,"Believe the good reviews for this item! This grinder is fast, easy to clean, and does a great job... and you can't beat the price. I don't live in a climate prone to static (Miami), so I can't comment on that reported issue- but I can definately attest that this grinder lives up to my expectations- is sturdy, and is easy to use. It's just for my wife and me, so it's small size is perfect for grinding up enough to brew for two (espresso grind). A short wooden skewer makes cleaning the exit shoot easy- I suppose a children's toothbrush would also do well. The beans even feed well into the hopper to grind."
1,"Bad when it worked, trash when it didn't","I was disappointed with this grinder after the first use. It operated slowly, always seemed to choke under load, and just felt generally cheap. The lid shape and receptor container are awkward, as is pushing the side button.The unit broke down internally after a few months of normal use, about 4-5 times per week. Tossing the corded brick to the trash can felt satisfying."
1,More of a Bean Cracker Rather than Grinder,I bought this grinder about a year ago. Frustrating to use on several facets of function:1.) Even on the Extra Fine Espresso grind selection the grounds are only suitable for use in a French press.2.) Have to shake the unit in order for the beans to feed into the grinder.3.) Grounds are tough to get out of the catch vessel of the grinder.4.) Noisy.
1,Save your money,"I agree with everything the previous reviewer wrote. Plus, after 3 months, my grinder jammed up and now doesn't grind coffee at all."
5,Purchased again even though replacing older one,"I purchased this product to replace an older one which had broken around the screw holes that mount this item. There are children who put papers into this wall file and so I know it took some abuse. Also, I am thinking the old unit may have been around for quite a few years. It was there when I arrived 3.5 years ago. It does the job and went back up quickly. I only needed one, but bought the three pack so that I could put up a couple more inside my office (since the other one is outside my door)."
4,Motown's Last Radio Station,"This hit-filled Motown video original is a fabulous fantasy that puts all new images to the Motown Sound. It all happens in the 1990's when every radio station has switched to video, except for one lone holdout. Only the myaterious last DJ and the timeless original Motown recordings can save The Last Radio Station from extinction. One in a series of exciting new Motown Video Originals where the Motown Sound never looked so good.Tracks: Reflections - Never Can Say Goodbye - How Sweet It IsNowhere To Run - Let's Get It On - Standing In The Shadows Of LoveIf I Were Your Woman - I Can't Get Next To You - Dancing In The StreetUptight."
2,Coloring my Husband,I own 4 Color me Beautiful books and this is proably the most dated of them all. I think this book should be edited for the new milleniium. I also cannot figure out why this book cost so much more than the women's Color me Beautiful books. I bought it at a used resaler and was happy not to pay upwards of $150 for the book. I am probably going to use my updated women's color books to figure out what my husband's best color pallette is.
4,Very good detailed descriptions of men vs. clothing color,"Great book! After finishing Color for Men I was amazed by the information contained in the book. Through trial and error (for the past three decades) I'd roughly figured out which colors look better on me. I wish I'd had this book 20 years ago. It does a very good job of showing which colors look good on various men's face colors through numerous color photo examples. Althrough it tries dilligently to walk the reader through the process of determining face color type, I still had a hard time determining which I am; but this is probably not the book's fault. I wish the on-line Internet clothing vendors would use the information in this book; it would make men's clothing shopping much easier. If you've ever wondered why that green shirt looks great on your brother but terrible on you, now you'll know."
5,I Was There,"Carolyn Haines' descriptions are so vivid and powerful that I felt I was walking on the road or actually sitting in the room with her characters. There were times the hairs on my arms just stood up or my heart was breaking with them. If Carolyn Haines was attempting to reveal the narrow mindness of people in small towns of the South, my opinion is She Nailed It. If she was trying to awaken compassion in her readers She Nailed It. Her characters took my heart. I am having flashbacks of times in her story and I am in the exact same spot with them I was while reading the book. I would recommend this as a wonderful read. It hurts but it certainly makes one think. I am so glad I read it. I believe it awakened a compassion in me which will remain a lifetime."
5,Great page-turner book,"Carolyn Haines' ""Bones"" books are great. I've just started reading her others, such as ""Touched"" and I think they expand on the touches of dark thought in the series, without being too intense. I'm enjoying working my way through these other books. So far I've enjoyed all of them."
5,Wildly entertaining!,"A must for all ""republicans"". The Kinsey Sicks really outdo themselves on this video. They have a very unique vocal style and harmonize extremely well throughout the show. I just wished I had bought this a long time ago. I hope they will do another video of their newer shows. I'm definitely a fan of the Kinsey Sicks!"
4,a MUST-have when dining out~,"Since my son started sitting in high chairs at restaurants, I've always worried about him eating off the dirty tables (or licking them). So when I found this rubber placemat, I thought it was perfect for eating out. It takes up very little space in the diaper bag since it rolls up into its ""catch tray"", it's super easy to wipe clean, and it doubles as a ""protective guard"" so my baby doesn't hit his face against the edge of tables. The suction is pretty decent, it sticks on most surfaces. All in all, for how inexpensive it is, it is a great product!!"
2,Not impressed,"Seems to be good quality, but wouldn't stick to our wood dining table - I tried wetting the suction and still no luck. It's been sitting in a drawer since we got it."
3,"placemat pleases, but shipping stinks","Our daughter asked for two of these for her daughter, so that's what we got. We thought they were a bit stiff and difficult to use, but perhaps they'll be better after being out of the box for a while. She liked them, and that's what counts. We did not like our experience with the manufacturer, Healthcheck systems, and would not buy anything from them again. Despite a shipping charge of nine dollars, they used a flimsy bag for shipping, and the boxes were crushed, not suitable for gifts."
4,Good Idea!,"We bought this placemat for my, now 19 month old. We take it with us to restaurants along with a highchair cover. It works well for the first half hour, until my son gets bored and rips it off of the table. It's a good idea to not put it on the table until food is actually served to prevent baby from tossing it before. Once the food is there, my son leaves it alone until he's done eating.The placemat washes up well in the sink, but every piece of lint or pet hair sticks to it because it's made of rubber. I just sprinkle a little baby powder on it to get things off of it.I would recommend this product because there isn't anything else out there that I have found that actually covers a table and almost stays in place. It could be improved, but it's all we have for now, and it's better than a dirty, germy table."
5,Best purchase ever!!,"My son is going on 2 and has several allergies with this place mat I have no fear about what has been left on the table before us!! I know no matter how much of a mess he makes it is on his own personal mat...he can eat on it, he can make a mess on it with out any problems. It fits very easily in the diaper bag and cleans up in a snap!!! NO more fears about yucky germs either...I know it is clean because I cleaned it!!! A must have for any mother with a child of vertually any age."
1,poor quality,"I purchased this in Mar 2012, to relpace the 'same' mat I had originally purchased sometime in 2010. I used to love this product, and was just interested in replacing the original mat because of expected wear and tear. The mat I just received in was SMALLER, constructed of NOT AS DURABLE plastic, and the catch-trough was ALREADY WEAK, immediately spilling anything my child dropped into his lap.I have reccommended this product to countless friends, but will STOP doing so, as it has become an inferior and basically useless product. I would have continued to include it in all baby-shower gifts I gave, but NOT anymore. I would return it, but with return shipping costs/my time, it is not worth it.Buyer Beware-- The favorable reviews you have read are probably based on the earlier product."
5,Great idea,Easy roll away. Stick it in your diaper bag. Easy clean. Saves having a mess when going to a restaurant.Saw our friends had one for their kids and had to buy one for ours.
3,Not bad ...,"Overall this does the job, but it's not perfect.Pros:1. Good size2. Easy to cleanCons:1. Suction cups don't stick well to our wooden table2. Crumb catcher is a nice idea, but became a toy on day 2 for our 11-month-old - we cut it off.Again, overall it does the job. Our daughter does try to fold it up and pull it off the table, but at least 3 of the suction cups work relatively well so she can't get it completely off and I'd rather deal with that than whole dishes of food hitting the floor. My husband loves the disposable place mats that I got to take to restaurants better because they tape down completely on all four sides, but they're a little pricey to use for every meal so this works."
5,Great Product!,I use these mats with my 2 1/2 yr. old twins at my dining room table. They keep the mess off wood and are easy to clean. You can also travel easily with them.
2,Hard to Clean,"I saw this and I thought it would be great. It would keep my daughter's food off of a dirty table and catch the food that she drops. It does do those things but it is hard to clean. It gets pretty dirty, and in the catching pouch, there are grooves that make it hard to wipe the mess out of. I used it twice and will never use it again. I recommend the Table Toppers- they are disposable mats that you stick to the table and throw away when you are done. They stay in place better, and you can wrap them around the edge of the table so baby will not put mouth on table. I use the mats with a crumb catcher bib from walmart that catches her messes better that this one did. Her lap says clean and clean up is a lot easier. You do not have to worry about putting the dirty mat back into your diaper bag."
3,Great to keep in the car - just in case.,"This placemat is fine to keep in the car just in case you don't have any of the disposable mats with you. The suction cups worked fine on mine and I just used a wet wipe to clean it up when my daughter was finished eating. Then I rolled it up and stuck it in my diaper bag until we got home. What I didn't like about it was the pocket that sits right in front of the baby. My daughter just wanted to play with it by lifting it up and down rather than eat her food. Solution? I cut it off and then it worked fine. But for the little time that you really need to use this (until your child is 18 months or so and should be able to eat without throwing a plate), I think the disposable ones were a little more convenient."
3,Great Concept,"We received this a few months ago and loved it. However, I wish the material it's constructed of would be stronger. With everyday use, 3 times a day, the pocket that hangs off the table to catch food (which works well) has started tearing away from the mat itself. I'm not sure how much longer it is going to last before we might have to get a new one. Maybe this is only for occasional use when you aren't home.Rolling it away is simple but we have never needed to take it with us anywhere. We just take wet ones and wipe down the table and use the bibs that have the molded pocket.The suction cups don't work on plastic over a tablecloth but then static keeps it in place well. The suctions cups underneath do make it bumpy around the edges. The colors are good and do match well to the bibs. I wish the material was a stiff as the bibs!!! or at least make one of stronger material to be used for everyday use.Suffice it to say...it works well, but how long it will last depends on your usage."
3,"Warning about the ""catching scoop""","First, this mat serves it's purpose and sticks to the table well with the suction cups. But, the ""catching scoop"" at the table's edge was completely useless. It is not at all rigid as pictured, and any swept off food went straight to the lap anyway. So, I cut the scoop off and it still performs as I intended."
2,Just ok,I thought this product looked great and based on other reviews I had high expectations. It does catch food- but the suction cups do not work at all.
4,perfect for tiny diners:),Love this for my toddler while eating out. Perfect size to accommodate a variety of foods. I took a star off because the suctions don't always stick. Otherwise its a great product.
3,"Great Idea, But....","I thought this idea was fantastic! I really didn't like the idea of my son eating off the tables at restaurants. He was too young for a plate. He would play with it and the food would be on the floor, so when I saw this we bought it immediately. We soon found out it was messier than letting him eat off the table! My son always wanted to flip it over (he flips everything over and inspects the bottom of everything-cute but can be annoying!). The suction cups didn't work at all. The hippo head wouldn't stay down, it wanted to roll back up. So he could easily get it up off the table and flip the food to the floor! (...)"
2,Good in theory,"I bought this thinking it would be great, but have been VERY disappointed. The suction cups don't stick very well (especially on wood)even if you wet them first. My daughter is able pull it right off the table and dump the mess on the floor."
3,Suction Cups Don't Stick,"Pros:Keeps food off of the table (usually).Easy to wipe down.Easy to roll up and stick in the diaper bag for travel.Cons:The suction cups aren't very suction-y, and my babers can easily pull it off of the table and throw it, along with his pile of cheerios or what have you, onto the floor.It's a good thing we have a dog."
1,TinyDiner Portable Placemat,Cute looking but not very useful. My 9 month old daughter just rips it off the table and throws it on the floor.
5,"A baby enthusiast from Hayward, CA - United States","As a first time mom I am very cautious of my 9-month-old son touching anything outside of my house. I give my son cheerios and a rice cake when we dine out and this product is fabulous......I love it!!!!! My son loves playing with his food....so he can rub his rice cake all over the tablemat and I don't have to worry about him picking up any germs with this mat. The food catcher is great....he looks for cheerios and rice cake crumbs in it.The only advice I would give is that before you put the mat down and push on the suction cups, you should use a wet one or wipe to wet the suction cups and then place it on the table. I found that it holds in place much better and the box that it comes in says to wet the suction cups as well."
5,Can't go out to dinner without it!,"This product is an excellent value. Suction cups on the back of the placemat attach securely to most restaurant tables, and the tray catches almost everything my little one drops. It also rolls up to conveniently place in the diaper bag. Every time I use it someone stops me to ask where I got it. It's a must for toddlers!"
3,Good concept,"The idea of this placemat is great and it does catch the food. However, it tends to collect fuz and hair everything sticks to it, and is hard to clean off."
5,great product,We love this mat. It stays put due to the great suction cups and I know my son is eating off a clean surface. Highly recommend this product.Kelly(mom of 4)
4,Works as advertised,"This item works very well, just as it is supposed to. However, I have had trouble with keeping the suction cups sticking to my wood table. I have also found that I do not use it at home as I expected to. My son just isn't messy enough for the extra thing to clear from the table. However, I could definitely see taking this to a resturant if you wanted to be sure your baby had a sanitized surface to clean on."
4,Great Theory .... OK Product,"My 11 month old is asserting her independence these days and wants to eat on her own. I like this product which works great in restaurants. It covers a large enough table area, I have no problems rolling it up and washing it later on at home and it fits perfectly into the insulated lunch box we use to cart around her finger foods. My only complaint is the ""trough"" as we have nicknamed it. It does well at catching dropped food bits, but it's also a perfect place for my daughter to grab on and pull the the whole placemat off the table! We're considering cutting it off ...."
4,A great invention for dining out with baby! Compliments galore !,"This placemat is wonderful ! I highly recommmend it. Not only does it allow baby to eat his finger food off of a clean surface, it helps to catch what doesn't reach his mouth ! Pair this product with a nice sturdy plastic bib with a catch at the bottom and you will pick up a lot fewer Cheerios off of the restaurant floor. Restaurant managers comment on it every time we bring it out. I've also used the plastic disposable self-adhesive placemats as well as the Nickelodeon themed inflatable placemat. The Tidy Diner takes up less space than the inflatable one and does a much better job then the other products I've tried. It makes a great shower gift ! I'm giving one to everyone I know who has a little one !"
2,Doesn't stick,"I bought this thinking it would be handy to take to restaurants, but it doesn't stick to many different types of tables. I used it about 3 times and then gave up. It's been gathering dust ever since."
4,Works well even at home,I have not used this product much in restaurants because my little one (almost 8 months) isn't eating much in the way of solids and her grandparents always want to hold her so she is hardly in a high chair when we eat out. :o) I have used it with my high chair pulled up to the dining table and it is great at catching cheerios that she moves around the mat. It also catches spills so I don't have to clean the table all the time. I know it will be of more use in the next few months though.
3,Just OK,"We have found that the suction cups on the bottom don't stick to wooden restaurant tables. We spend most of our meal trying to keep our daughter from pulling this off the table. Otherwise, it's easy to clean, compact and easy to pack, and does its job well if our daughter is more interested in eating than pulling it up."
2,be careful with wood tables,"we use this with a portable chair that mounts onto the table. When we clamp the chair down over the mat on our wood dining table it leaves marks from the clamps. The chair by itself makes no marks at all, so it must be some type of reaction with the placemat and the wood. be careful...... have put some heavy card stock in to separate from the table and seems to do fine. other than that it works great. easy to travel with and easy to clean (if you take it off the table and throw it in the sink... doesn't wipe off real well with a damp rag)"
2,good concept but.....,i was so excited to use this when i first bought it. i was quickly disappointed. this is a good concept but it just doesn't stay suctioned. this ended up being tossed around by my little guy and he would not leave it alone. i ended up buying and using the disposable table toppers and found that they make going out to eat a lot less stressful.
3,Effectiveness Depends on Table and Baby,"I bought this placemat because I wanted to be able to protect my mother's table when bringing my seven-month-old son to visit her. Unfortunately, it would not stick to her tabletop (which is wooden). Even when my son was not trying to pull it up, the suction cups came detached on their own. For most of the mealtime, the placemat was in my baby's mouth!I imagine that this placemat sticks to non-wooden tabletops better than it does to wood. I also bet that a child that was past the stage of putting everything in his/her mouth might not constantly try to pull the placemat up.I think this placemat is a great idea. I wish it had worked for us!"
2,Ok if you baby doesn't pull it off the table,My son figured out during the first use how to pull it off of the table. He was trilled with the little crumb catcher and kept pealing it back to look underneath. He wouldn't even eat with it. I may just cut that part off with a pair of scissor and see if that works better.
4,We love it,"It is great, and we use it every time we go out with our 1 year old. Yes the suction cup under his head almost never sticks to the table but the rest stick to most tables. Our son can rip it off the table if he gets determined but if we keep an eye on him it works great. the scoop catches a lot and of food and our son likes to put food in and take it back out which keeps him busy and keeps him from dropping food all over the floor. I would always recommend to rinse it off in the bathroom sink before you head out so as to not forget and find it dirty at the next restaurant. I like that it is reusable and not disposable we through away to much as it is."
3,"Great idea, but baby likes it too much.","The TinyDiner is a great idea and I have no complaints with its design. The suction cups really adhere to the table, it keeps all of the crumbs in one place, and it folds into itself for easy storage. The only problem is that our son is enamored with the thing and won't leave it alone. He is either pulling the placemat up or chewing on the trough. We're hoping that the novelty will eventually wear off and he'll quit noticing it's there. Until then we'll look back fondly on the days of simply wiping down the table and hoping for the best."
3,All things considered...,"All things considered this placemat is...OK. We got this for our son awhile back and we're somewhat pleased with the product. It does what it's supposed to do: keep the food from touching the dirty table. Our son ,however, was more interested in pulling it off of the table - the suction cups don't really do their job. The ""food catcher"" was pretty irrelevant. However, the worst part for me was that it stains REALLY easily. Don't give you child any tomato-based products to eat off of this placemat because it will forever be stained. It also retains smells. The placemat permanently reeks of barbecue after using it at the local BBQ joint.So, even though I feel there are many cons to this product, I do prefer it to disposable placemats in an effort to be more enviornmentally friendly."
5,AMAZING PLACEMAT!!!!,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I OWN ONE AND USE IT ALL THE TIME.MY TODDLER LIKES TO PUT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING IN HIS MOUTH AS ANY ONE WOULD AND THIS PLACEMAT HELPS MAKE SURE HE ONLY EATS WHAT IS CLEAN AND HAS LESS BACTERIA.IT IS ALSO DURABLE, FLEXIBLE AND EASY TO CLEAN AND ONCE DONE, JUST ROLL IT AND PUT IT AWAY. AMAZING."
2,Not the best,"The mat didn't lay flat or stay suctioned to the table. Milk cups repeatedly fell over due to this and rolled off table. It wasn't very easy to clean without soaking it everyday. We liked the thickness of it and thought the part the hung over the table was a good idea, but it just made a worse mess when the kids leaned over it."
2,Doesn't work on our table,"Didn't really think about whether the suction cups would work on a porous surface (they don't) so that's my fault. I've tried it on our bench top and it's ok, but because of the way it is packaged/rolled up it doesn't lay very flat. My baby can just pick it up and rip it off.The colour of the product received is much brighter than the pastel green in the image provided.Will probably re-sell or give this one away, or just keep it for traveling."
2,Didn't work on my table,"I actually bought this at Baby's R US. I tried to use it on my oak dining room table and the suctions cups didn't work. The table has some texture to it, so that may be the problem. I will be returning it."
2,Not for Toddlers,"I bought the placemat for travel purposes for my 15 month old who loves to self-feed but will throw plates around if they are in front of him. In theory, this placemat is a great idea but the suctions are not strong enough for a toddler; he had this thing off the table in 15 seconds. Now it is sitting in the closet. I hate wasting money."
3,Suits our purposes well enough.,"Overall I think this is an ok placemat to keep in the diaper bag. We've used it just about every restaurant we go to.Pros:-Fairly compact, folds up into the diaper bag easy enough-Sticks pretty well to most the tables we've used it on.-Better than putting her food on the table for her. (I've seen a lot of parents doing this recently...Really? Ick.)Cons:-Is not dishwasher safe despite claiming to be. After running mine through the dishwasher it came out warped and never folded back correctly again. Didn't even use the hot dry cycle on it.-Hard to clean up on the go.- My 1 year old knows how to pull the suction cups up now and does so frequently.- The food catch part of it really isn't that helpful at all. She just likes to pull on it and roll it up.I originally bought the blue one but am now purchasing the green since the blue one warped in the dishwasher. Won't be doing that again."
4,Stains but does the trick,"I really like this product because the rubber-like surface cleans easily and attaches well to most surfaces. I love the spill catcher! In my mind, that is the best feature. My only complaint is that it stains easily. Pasta sauce and ketchup leave the worst stains. I wish it came in a darker color."
3,Haven't used it quite as much as we expected...,"This is a good product but a little limited in it's use. I wanted to keep her little fingers off the dirty tables when we were out and about and for the most part, this does the trick. She isn't eating anything off it yet, she is too young. She just likes to drum on the tables and put her hands on them. My only complaint would be that it doesn't stick to all surfaces but will be fine at most restaurants. I specifically had the outdoor tables at the coffee shop in mind when I bought it and it doesn't secure well to those due to small holes in the table. I'd recommend it as long as you understand the limitations, (if it doesn't stick, your little one will almost surely pull it off and play with it, not a horrible thing in my opinion it keeps her entertained). Also, it rolls up nicely and fits in the diaper bag."
4,Dreddy Kruger/Wu Tang Compilation,"First got this album back in 05'. Great music from Wu-Affiliates being mended together by Dreddy Kruger. Heavy production material from Bronze Nazareth, Perservation, RZA, DJ Noize, and Mathematics. Solid-shining guest appearances from GZA, Ras Kass, Vast Aire, Byata, U God, Sean Price, Prodigal Sunn, C-Rayz Walz, La The Dark Man, Timbo King, Solomon Childs, MF Doom & RZA, R.A. The Rugged Man, Littles, Planet Asia and Del Tha Funky Homosapien. Pure bangin' hip hop throughout. Favorite trax are ""Slow Blues"", ""Still Grimey"", ""Biochemical Equation"" and ""Verses""."
4,"great album mixing hardcore with indie rap, but not much here thats new","This album mixes hardcore emcees such as members from teh Wu-Tang crew and indie rappers such as Casual, Aesop Rock, Del MF DOOM. A great album with tight lyrics represented from the finest heads in hip hop. To me, the stand out tracks are the ones by Aesop/Del, Rza/Mf DOOM, and the stand alone track by Del. The rest of the songs are tight and worth listening to, but there is really nothing new or inventive about this album. The songs featuring the GZA and Rass Kass are tight, but most of the album is classic street/hardcore hip hop, something which I cannot relate to. Granted anything by the Wu is worth listening to, and this album is worth buying, but as far as this album goes, this is classic hip hop at its finest. My tastes are geared toward inventive, new and innovative hip hop so i'm a little biased..Harcore hip hop heads will rejoice at this album and indie heads will enjoy the tight beats and the collab of artists."
2,WACK BEATS,"OH MY GOD...THE NAMES ON THIS CD ARE KIND OF DECEIVING...IT HAS ALOT OF TALENTED MC'S BUT THE PRODUCTION IS GARBAGE, SOMEONE LEAVING A REVIEW TOWARDS THE TOP SAID THAT THE RASS KASS AND GZA CUT WAS SICK, DON'T GET ME WRONG THE VERSES THEY DROP ARE OFF THE HOOK AS USUAL BUT THE BEAT LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRED...THE REVIEWER ALSO SAID IT WAS HIS FAVORITE BEAT ON THE ALBUM...WOW, IT WAS AN AWFUL SAMPLE WITH OFF BEAT DRUMS...COME ON MAN...WHAT ARE U LISTENING TO?"
4,the revolution has arrived!,"I remember when this CD came out several years ago. A band that could combine the raw D.I.Y. aesthetic of punk, the sophistication of Serge Gainsbourg, the familiarity of the Smiths, the electronic noodlings of Stereolab, was certainly refreshing in an age of alt-rock mediocrity. Listen to them if you like all the bands/artists I've mentioned above. My favourite songs are ""This is a Broadcast"" and ""Heartless Romantic"". The Dears are even better live!"
3,Given a TPB too soon.,"Why this was made into a TPB, especially so soon after the original comics' publication, is beyond me. Quesada takes a good idea -- Iron Man's armor coming to life -- and does a decent job of it. (Although not as good as Mike Saenz did with the all-computer-generated-art graphic novel CRASH.) The living armor's origins are pretty apocryphal (the ""Y2K bug?"" Come ON!), but it gets pretty spooky when the armor gets nasty -- in particular when it ""deposits"" Tony Stark on a desert island so that he can ponder whether he should join w/the armor or not!The events of this TPB are being expounded upon in Iron Man's title even now, so many of its aspects may be rendered moot."
3,Not the best. But not the worst either.,Joe Quesada isn't the worst IM writer ever but he is far from the best (With Dave and Bob I doubt anyone ever can be) The Sentient Armor was a silly idea to begin with so and their wasn't much that Joe Quesada could do to pull it out of the fire. And to the reviewer that was dissing Kevin Smith...I think you don't know what comedy is....
4,Great book TONS of pictures,"I liked this book because I am a very visual person, so for me to really be able to get an idea of what i want in my new home I really have to be able to see it. It is a great book for ideas with lots of pictures. However the how to part is very short and sweet. It tells you what is in the picture and what they did do make that effect. I really enjoyed this one!"
1,Not one good idea!!,"I was shocked by how bad this book was. I am a new homeowner decorating my first home and I'm pretty radical when it comes to design. I LOVE bold colors and there won't be a white wall in my house if I can help it! I'd say my style is somewhere around transitional/neo-retro/modern. I'm sorry to say it, but this book isn't creative or fanciful, it's just stupid. Among her ideas were things like attaching an empty crooked frame hanging halfway off a mantle. She also likes to paste random bits of torn tissue paper onto walls, um, randomly. (I'm serious.) There's a place for asymmetry, she just doesn't seem to know where it is. I own a dozen or more decorating books and this is the only one I found utterly useless. Don't waste your money!!"
2,So-So book,"I purchased this book because I wanted to get some fresh new decorating ideas that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg. I was disappointed to see that most of the ideas in this book contained gawdy bright creations. I would never use most of these ideas in my home because all the ideas are so bright and loud. They may be able to be used in a child's room where technicolor is appropriate. I don't think this is a book to purchase if you have an elegant ""grown up"" style of decorating in your home."
4,Great Inspiration!!,"This book has beautiful pictures. The ""how-to"" isn't all that informative, and some of the ideas are more colorful than I would put into my household, but the pics give you GREAT ideas. Just looking through it, my mind was reeling with ideas for my house. If you need a little push... a little inspiration... this is a great book."
5,A CLASSIC JEWEL,"For me, this is the most romantic album from the Master of easy Listening Music, I adore TAMMY, YOUNG LOVE, NO OTHER LOVE and MEMORIES ARE MADE OF THIS; thanks amazon for make me dream again."
3,"Ray Conniff, Chorus?","The disc title is: ""Ray Conniff and His Orchestra and Chorus"". If you're thinking of buying this disc to hear the chorus, you will be disappointed."
3,DeLonghi XU440W Alfredo Toaster Oven,The toaster toasts pretty evenly and it heats up well. One of things I am not satisfied with is the closing mechanism on the toaster - it doesn't catch well. It's not Delonghi's best product - it's just satisfactory.
5,Review of DeLonghi Belgian Waffle Maker,"My husband received this waffle maker from our children as a Christmas gift, and the entire family has enjoyed it. It not only makes great Belgian waffles, but it also makes great grilled sandwiches."
5,"Excellent book, written by a true conservative.","This is a excellent book that is well written and plain spoken. The author is a common sense conservative republican that is smart and successful, proving that you don't have to vote democrat to be something. In the book he address the issues facing many Americans today and solutions to those issues. Highly recommended, especially to any drone who thinks they have to vote or agree with a democrat to be something."
5,You thought we were stupid,"and we are, but even stupid people, even caterers, even Republicans, gossip about people's sex lives. What made you think that only people who vote Democratic would object to employers demanding sex in return for job offers? We thought that the Republican Party stood for moral values. You should have run as a Democrat, if you're going to carry on the way you do.Now, after you drop out of the race, you can go about the country collecting speaking fees. Just like godless professors and Hollywood libertines. Shame!*Five stars for the high moral content. At least people can talk a good show.*"
1,Cain thinks you're stupid,Cain is really full of baseless rhetoric. He thinks your stupid enough to read his book. He has no business writing because he makes unsubstantiated assumptions about politics. This man will fade in 15 minutes.
1,And they're not wrong,"What else would you call people who consistently vote against their own interests? If it isn't ""crazy"" then it has to be ""stupid"". The idea that the Republican Party is capable of offering anything better is just more of the same. Take a look at the last six years of lies, cheating, thievery and bald-faced pandering, from Iraq to Tom DeLay's ethics committee to Schiavo to Katrina. If you're willing to believe Mr. Cain's thesis in the face of that, guess who else the adjective applies to?"
2,How many songs? Titles?,"I was about ready to add this to my cart when I noticed that nowhere in the product description, nor in any of the reviews, can a customer find a listing of the videos included. There is not even a mention of the NUMBER of tracks, nor of the running time of the disc. All this, and the fact that so many people are mentioning the sound problems, means that I am NOT purchasing this, even though I am a BIG fan of Sara."
5,So Sara!,"The reviewers criticizing the sound are right: there is a real goof-up with the sound that makes it sound like Sara is singing inside of an echoing cave, especially on the first 2 songs. The situation seems to get better on the latter 4 songs. Anyway, the DVD allows for selection of sound: Dolby 5.1 or Surround. When I chose the one that isn't the default setting, the sound was just fine, completely normal.Once you get over the sound issues, the DVD is excellent. 6 of Sara's good songs and Sara looks awesome in all of the videos. One could complain that there's only 6 songs, but possibly she just didn't make any more than that. What is here is excellent. Definitely worthwhile for Sara fans to have.The songs are: Fly, Could not Ask for More [from Fly album], Suds in Bucket and Perfect from the Restless album, and Cheatin [yeah, it's ironic, sure] and Real Fine Place to Start from the Real Fine Place album. Good show, Sara!"
3,Terrible sound quality,This would be an excellent video but the audio is majorly bad. I didn't actually believe another review I saw about it but it's true....the front and rear channels are reversed! I guess I could move my living room around and watch this dvd..........
1,Sara Evans DVD,"This DVD is among a few I own that feature Sara Evans.I bought one of this specific DVD here and the sound sucked,so I thought it was just the DVD. I went to Wal-Mart and bought this same DVD again,and it does the same thing with the sound.All of these Sara Evan's DVD's have sound issues,the picture is fine,but there's no sound. Don't waste your money buying this from here because you'll be stuck with it,and the store will only exchange the dvd for the same one and will not give you a refund.So if you want a good DVD of her that actually works get the CMT one..."
1,RCA,"I am a mobile dj/vj here in Texas with over 22,000 dvd music videos. from Promo Only, Screenplay. One thing I have learned is that RCA makes the worst music video collections. Eurythmics and Sara Evans . Sound quality is the pits. I wonder who is in charge at RCA?I only play videos from the video services because they are far better quality than this RCA junk"
2,Poor graphics,A intertaining DVD but the graphics quality gave me cause to wonder if it might be an after market product?
4,beautiful,"Not only is Sara one of the most beautiful in country music, but the videos as well. At least the ones filmed with southwestern scenery are. Not many selections on this dvd, but still holds up for the price."
1,Poor Sara!,"I guess Sara' talent deserves some respect.How is it possible the Dolby 5.1 mixing be messed that way?The front and rear channels are reversed, the ""main sound"" are on the rear speakers and the ""echoes sounds"" came from the front speakers!!!Even here in Brazil we noticed that! What a shame!!"
1,lacks cohesion,"A lot of the concepts that Patilla was trying to get at with this book went over my head, and I have a college degree and well beyond 8 years of age, so that doesn't say much for the clarity of his writing. The use of illustrations is poor. A poor job all over."
2,Not great,I ordered these curtains to match the Star Wars comforter i had ordered. They do not come with a lining which was ok but they are paper thin and therefore do not hang very well. Overall a bit disappointing.
4,Not my favorite Kaplan book,"I have read so many of his books and just wasn't as impressed with this one. It fell a bit flat, in comparison to his older books. Still, a very nice read overall. I was just expecting more."
3,A good read.,"This book is, mostly, based on Kaplan's earliest travels through the mediterranean with additional comments and commentary from his subsequent experiences in the area. It is interesting to see how the author evolved into the type of writer he is now and how his travels inspire his interest in learning more about the history, architecture and literature connected to a given area."
3,Tantalizing textures,"3 1/2Two lengthy ambient tracks that compliment each other in a way that makes them both add up; it isn't all perfectly fresh, but for the most part the sound stays startlingly seductive."
2,Hasn't aged particularly well,"While this may have been technically impressive at the time it was written (1968), it doesnt really stand the test of time; if I had heard it without knowing it was by Terry Riley, I would have thought I was listening to a fairly average modern electronica piece. There is minimalist work that has aged better than this; for example ""Tago Mago"" by Can, and some pieces by Philip Glass and Arvo Part. In the realm of early electronica, Jean Michel Jarre's ""Oxygene"" blows Riley's work away despite being only recorded 5 years later.The second piece (Poppy Nogood) is significantly more interesting than Rainbow imo, although both lack any real emotional depth."
4,if william tell had mixed up semen instead of powder,listen - i didn't hallucinate or anything. or unlike my predecessors have shower me people or Dan diagelo affairs in 1969. however i did corral this in with SISTER RAY and blast off on a curve of my own. i kept wanting lou reed to come over the entire time i listened. basically to speak without confusion: its not bad people. it is not classical music either. but its still good and fine and i would buy it just because it will make you jump and if you already have a pentium 3 buy it anyway.
1,poorly constructed chest,"First off let me just start by saying that this item arrived very quickly but unfortunately arrived damaged. Upon inspecting this item I also noticed that it is very poorly constructed. I can't see anyone receiving this item undamaged. It is made from pressed wood which feels almost like thick cardboard. I can't imagine anyone being able to keep this for years of use. If it didn't arrive damaged, I'm sure my son, who is 1, would have this destroyed in a few days. I would def. steer clear of this product. I liked the idea that this was microfiber instead of painted wood which was what attracted me to it in the first place. I hope I can find a similar but well-made product. Not worth the $106 that is on the price tag. More like a $25 product."
1,Unattractive and Poor Quality,"I was very very disappointed in this product. From the reviews, I expected a very nice piece, but the actual toy box was very poorly made. I ordered the pink and white polka dot, and the fabric was a really cheap furry fabric that looked absolutely awful. You would have to use your hand to make it all go the same direction to look even halfway decent, and in some areas of the box, it was stretched funny and the polka dots were more oval. The inside isn't lined with anything and is just particle board. I have bought much nicer boxes from Target for less money. I think I'll stick with those. Thankfully Amazon has free returns because this one is going right back."
2,"In two attempts, could not get the right color","Ordered this box in Tan Dot (color name). Arrived first time with a blue, tan, brown pattern. Returned the item for exchange. Customer service was very nice, paid for shipping and everything, even arranged for pick up. Arrived second time with same color pattern, not Tan Dot. Tan Dot would have been a much more in tune with my other room furnishings. But I gave up and accepted that they don't know Tan Dot from Blue/Tan/Brown circles.The box itself is great. Very happy with the construction, function, features."
4,good looking toy box with great safety features,"This is a great toy box. It does the job of storing and hiding toys while looking good in a room with adult furniture. Perfect for our living room. I'm very happy that the box cannot slam shut and that it has air vents, two excellent safety features. I'm also pleased that the lid stays open rather than dropping shut when a toddler opens it. An adult can sit on the box and it's perfectly sturdy. I definitely recommend this toy box, but I didn't give it a perfect 5 stars for a few reasons. (1) It's not comfortable to sit on despite having a small amount of padding on the top. (2) There's no way to lock the box, should you want to keep your toddlers from making a mess with their toys before company comes. And (3) it looks like cheap plywood on the inside. On the other hand, all of these things probably keep the cost down, so maybe they were good tradeoffs, and a lock designed for adults could be misused as a dangerous prank by kids."
4,Better than I expected,"After reading the previous reviews I was a bit skeptical of the quality of the product but once open, I inspected it and didn't find any major flaws or assembly problems described here in previous reviews. Obviously it's not made of ""real"" wood but the hinge system felt solid and robust enough to last more than a couple of months in a kid's bedroom.One negative was the tiny plastic ""feet"" that come installed on the bottom (sort of a caster pushed into the box with a nail). One of them immediately fell off coming out the packing box and the others could be removed by hand with no tool and very little force. Since I was putting this on carpet I didn't care and just got rid of them but if you need something like that, I recommend a quick trip to the hardware store to put something screwed in instead. It could be a hazard for small children if they came off."
3,Looks good,"I do love the look of this toy box, it looks great. However, I was very disappointed to find that the inside wasn't lined."
3,A far fetched place to hold the Worlds Fair,"I actually liked this book. It was from a boys point of view. And as is I think typical of Robert Silverberg, he takes a turning point in someones life, and makes a wonderfull book out of it. Not only does this boy get included in an alien incounter, but he gets to find more alien life forms. What person would not want to do all these things themselves."
1,Too much!,"I was very disappointed. Beautiful photographs of garish subjects that the average person couldn't possibly duplicate made it almost ridiculous. I love museums and that's what this book reminded me of. You can look, enjoy and appreciate but can't take it home and use it. Thumb through it at a store and save your money."
5,absolutely amazing,"This is an amazing book! While most people may not be able to re-create these parties, you can definitely get ideas from all of them. Take the ideas here and apply them to one or two tables or a small area. The pictures are wonderful and I am amazed at what is done in some of these parties. Would love to have a chance just to walk through one of these!!!!"
4,preston,"the book is quite illustrative, however there is a lot of overlap with his other book on Fantasy Weddings, which has better theme pictures."
4,Excellent Condition,"The book was in great shape when I received it. Also, I got a little surprise from the previous owner...a few loose blooms being pressed. Thanks you Amazon."
3,"Decent, But Not Among Her Best","One of the very few listenable tracks from her underwhelming AMERICAN LIFE, the maxi-single for HOLLYWOOD finds Madonna continuing to push the envelope on the remix front--no matter that the often cold, techno-style beats often suck the life out of the original song. The Calderone and Quayle mix is by far the most straigtforward, and best, of the bunch here, though Paul Oakenfold's take isn't so bad. All in all, not a bad effort--better than the AMERICAN LIFE remixes, but not as good as the DIE ANOTHER DAY maxi-single."
4,It's not the techno-influence that's the problem,"The problem with ""Hollywood"" is not that it's too techno-heavy...it's because the lyrics are too depressing. She stop being an activist...and get back to the making pumpin' tunes that she's good at. It's got her this far..why ruin the formula? The thin white duck mix on here is brilliant...why couldn't that have been the album version?! I whole-heartedly disagree that she's pushing a ""tired sound."" (mistermaxx) It's the lyrical foundation that's tired, whiney, and overbearing. We want to hear some groovy, totally catchy Madonna!"
1,"""Trip the Station Change the Channel"" PLEASE!!!","I have never considered any Madonna CD to be ""one star"" worthy but this is really bad. I even like the AMERICAN LIFE album, but the remixes on ""Hollywood"" are terrible.While remix singles should be danceable, this is not. It doesn't seem to be going in any direction. There's a lot of slow downs in these songs and that's very frustrating.This will most likely break Madonna's long string of #1 club hits. I have all of Madonna's maxi-singles and this one I can do without. This in now way diminishes her contribution to music but just a bump on the road. Sorry maybe next time."
2,Nope--Try Again,"I am sorry, but I did not like this song. I've read through many of the reviews, and per usual, Madonna's lambs rush to save face and proclaim this her ""best single yet"". (In Madonna country, this has to be the lamest, most overused phrase.) Every single Madonna releases is ""her best yet""--at least, that is what her lambs would say.I am still waiting for Madonna to follow up Ray of Light, which was brilliant. But, as long as her fans continue to be satisfied with the kind of mess on American Life, I am afraid Madonna's complaceny will continue. Why spend months working your butt off on a project, when you can spend a couple of days throwing some tracks together--and your loyal lambs will still rush out to the CD store, cash in hand, and pick it up?"
4,Donna goes clubby,"Although ""American life"" album wasn't a great success, Madonna managed to release some nice singles out of it.""Hollywood"", in my opinion, is one of the strongest cuts.We see her coming back to the roots, to the clubs. Almost all mixes presented here are longer than 7 minutes, thus great to play in every disco.It is worth to mention that one of the best mixes here is done by Stuart Price (man responsible for bombs like ""Hung up"" a few years later).There is only one weak moment on this maxi single and it is track no 3. The tricks and computers killed the soul of the song.The rest is good or very good.Worth to have and to listen to."
4,Stuart Price again betters the original song.,"Jacques Lu Cont (a.k.a. Stuart Price) has again amazed me by making a great song an even better one. The main attraction of this single is definitely his Thin White Duke Mix. None of the other remixes bear any exceptional ground, and seem just to be fillers on this late US Maxi Single release. It comes with the Album version, clean of the fade out from 'American Life' - a bonus for many reasons. Both the Calderone & Quayle Glam Mix and The Micronauts Remix are runners up to Price, but don't draw the same level of material excellence.One annoying factor on this package is that there is a horrible typographical error in the printing - Price's remix reads 'Thin White DUCK Remix' - certainly a contention of hilarity! If you are interested in more songs Price has made the better of, try the rest of his 'Thin White Duke' Remixes, especially Britney Spears' 'Breathe On Me'."
3,where's the Sander Kleinenberg mix?,"This is a fine song from Madonna that, unfortunately, became her first single not to make Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart since ""Everybody"" back in 1982.Its album version is very good, but I must ask: where is the kickass remix by Sander Kleinenberg? Yet another fine remix that will only be available as a bootleg white-label 12-inch. Who rejects these mixes? Just recently I was able to obtain the Deep Dish remix of ""Impressive Instant,"" which was also never released.Whether it be Madonna's decision or others at Maverick, someone needs to make more of these remixes widely available to people."
3,Same as pt 1,"This has only 3 remixes, and they are all included on the maxi of Hollywood. I give this 3 stars because these *are* the best mixes from the maxi. Buy the maxi instead."
1,time for change Madonna,Madonna's heavy Flirting with Techno has gots to go.another Album of this is too much to handle.a Album of it is one thing but to still be pushing this tired Sound out is a mess.this Song is rather flat&leaves me feeling empty as much of Her Work Since about 95.I've liked some songs here&there but nothing has really grabbed me fully.
3,V for Variety,"While I really dig the AMERICAN LIFE album, this song isn't particularly one of my favorites. That being said, it is an enjoyable and quite catchy tune with excellent production values. The maxi-single features the radio edit and 5 very different mixes from 5 prolific d.j.'s. The Calderone Mix is the most straight forward club anthem type version while the Micronauts deliver quite an odd variation that you'll most likely either love or hate (I'm of the latter camp). Deepsky and Paul Oakenfold's mixes were my favorites: original with great grooves."
1,A waste of money....,"Despite the name, this book is not the ""ultimate"" guide to Chicago area private schools. It appears to be missing a lot of schools in the area, and the information it contains about the schools it does cover is quite cursory (and looks like it was pulled straight from the schools' glossy brochures). Also, there is no attempt to indicate a particular school's reputation in the community (occasionally, however, the book will list Iowa test scores or indicate what percentage of the school's graduates go on to college). Maybe I'm being too particular, but I was expecting to find statements like ""regarded as one of the best private elementary schools on the North Shore, ABC School...."". Save your money and don't buy this one."
3,Wait!! A Better Collection Is In The Works!!!,"My major frustration with this DVD is that there are only 4 episodes picked at random from the 14 years of ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet."" If I were you, I'd check into the complete series. Sam Nelson (Ricky Nelson's son) is actually raising money (from now until Nov. 3, 2011) to restore the entire 435-episode series of ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" and include the original commercials too! He hopes to have the entire series restored by the time ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" is inducted into the Smithsonian."
4,I wanna be sugar free,sugar free is one of favorite 80's songs I really flipped when mc eiht sampled it on it's a compton thing way before anybody heard of az.
5,way back when,"another album that was purchased at a changing time in my life. newlywed and very early in my military career, takes me back to that very time and place. good album that included 2 hits, 'bad boy' and 'sugarfree', one hit wonders that i will always have a place in my heart and mind."
3,Get way more than you think you need!,"We expected this to offer us protection that would cause liquid to bead up and wipe off. however, even after using 3 cans on a couch and 2 cans on a loveseat, we still don't have the ""coverage"" we desire. I suspect this is because of the thickness of the coat needed to obtain this effect. Also, be sure to test for colorfastness as directed on the cans. We did the colorfast test incorrectly, and now our furniture's pigment rubs off - so even after treating, we had to invest in slipcovers - OUR FAULT, not Scotch Guard's. I highly recommend AGAINST using this on microsuede."
4,Pretty good for a microfiber sofa set,"I used the Scotchgard 4106D 10-Ounce Fabric and Upholstery Protector, for my microfiber sofa set and guess what, it cleaned it well. The reason i gave 4 stars is for some having some more traces of dirt of the sofa even after using it. I may have to apply one more round of spray. It smells for the first 30 min after you apply the spray, but keeping doors and windows should help the smell to disappear. One bottle was just enough for me for cleaning a 3 seater and 2 seater sofa. Wish they ad some more like may be 12 oz so that it would be sufficient for both the sofas.. Anyway a good purchase for a good price.."
5,Easy to apply,Hard to find fault with a product that has been around for so long! This does its job and is very easy to apply. The fumes are very potent so make sure you apply this outside or in a very well-ventilated room.
4,Great protector - use in a well ventilated area,"Works well, helps clothes/fabrics repel stains and water. Treated a jacket with this and it all beads right off. Just remember to do it in a well-ventilated area because it stinks a bit and you can get light-headed. Also, do this in an area where you don't mind the overspray going onto the floor. It made my linoleum in the bathroom a bit slick for a while."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,I LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND RECOMMEND IT. I WILL BE GETTING SEVERAL CANS TO TREAT MY OUTDOOR PATIO CUSHIONS.IT HELPS TO ROLL OFF THE WATER SO YOU DO NOT GET WATER STAINS.
4,It works- just have to be quick to clean!,I'm really glad I got this scotch guard cause I have 4 kids who tend to spill! It works great if you wipe it right away after a spill!
5,Fabric Protector,I bought this to protect some rockers I bought for my small children (kindergarten and under). I am so glad I did. It makes the chairs so much easier to clean.
5,great stuff,Works very well. worth the price and water protects most itemsshould buy for outer clothing and camping equipment ..
4,Scotch Guard,"Excellent fabric protection for new furniture, cheaper (and quality more controllable) than having manufacturer put it on. Only concern might be chemicals for those with multiple chemical sensitivity. Also, wish it were just a little cheaper. I used 2 whole cans to cover one reclining rocker (can says one can will cover two chairs). I didn't overspray either, just light coverage back and forth at the appropriate distance. When that dried, I did apply another light coat, as recommended, rather than one thick spray coat."
2,3M:,I'm So Surprised 3M Products Usually Work Like A Charm But This Product I Don't Know I Sprayed A Generous Amount On The Sofa And The Water Still Seeped Through No Big Deal I'll Just Try Again I'm Sure It's Something That I'm Not Doing Correctly But We'll Just Have To Wait And see.
1,double the price,There is nothing wrong with the product but the price here is about twice the price found at Target in Boston for the same thing. I guess the buyer should beware. I did not check the regular megamart price so I lost.
2,Furniture Product,I was initially disappointed in this product. it was advertised as a 14 oz item and when I received the item it was only 10 oz. Which meant that now I have to buy another can. I emailed the seller and did not hear from them for a few days and was getting ready to report them when they emailed me back. The seller did credit me for some of the price of the product.
3,Cannot be used on all fabric,"I ordered three cans in order to treat cushions we were having re-covered. With seven cats in the house, it's important to be able to easily remove cat hair and an occasional hairball. The instructions on the can strongly suggest doing a colorfast test on a hidden area of the material. Unfortunately, all of our fabric failed the colorfast test so we've not been able to use the product, (although I expect it's fine with compatible material). Just be aware that it can't be used on everything. I've heard it's great on canvas shoes, so I'll be giving that a try."
2,Cheap but doesn't fit everyone,"I just received this shoes and wear it for a day. This shoes looks great, so does the material. The only problem is the opening design. The elastic and opening height make it difficult to wear and take off, and it also makes you hurt if you have wider ankles. The size is a bit small, so if your foot is wide, take 0.5 size bigger than usual.I bought it for $15.99, including shipping cost. I don't want to spend more changing for a bigger size, so I just cut the elastic part off. It works! Now it's easier to put on/take off, and feels more comfortable while wearing it.Fashion looking, great deal, but a so-so shoes. If you confront the same issue I had, try to cut off the elastic part."
1,It hurts,"Stupid design of the shoes make it hard to get the foot in, yet after you get the foot in, the openning is too large to hold the foot secure. So when you walk fast the loosen part of the shoe scrach the back of my foot. The shoe is too hot for the summer and too cold for the winter time, not water resistent since it has the strench material at the side. No sure the purpose of this shoe. I pay $16 for it but I still think I did get a good deal.For people who has hard time to put the shoes on, try to enter the shoe side way, from the side that has the strench material, it should make it easier."
1,there's a reason for such a huge discount,"These shoes probably can't be sold in a physical store because people can't put them on. Even the mass discounters won't take em. So I bought them on-line, thinking of the great Teva quality and design. I am disappointed. I have the correct size, and once I got my foot in, they fit and were comfortable. But it took 2 people more than 15 minutes just for me to put these on! Even with a shoe horn, it's very difficult to put them on. I'm telling myself that the material will become more pliable after I wear it a few weeks. Basically there's no shoelace. You have to sqeeze your foot through the top of the shoe. It does have some elastic, but that's inadequate. WEAR THESE IN A REAL STORE FIRST BEFORE BUYING."
1,Avoid Teva Co.,Teva misleads customers with sale items then cancel orders. Probably just collecting your data with the ol' bait-and-switch. Don't support them.
3,con law class requirement,i dont know what to write here. it was a required for a class i took. sold it back soon as class was over.
3,"Historical, Social and Personal Context Elucidated","This book does something not terribly original, but still intruiging. It presents detailed social, historical and personal context for various constitutional disputes, most of which appear to have far exceeded their ostensibly limited origin and scope. Hence, seemingly minor tiffs have resulted in sharp changes in direction in Constitutional Law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, in a manner which may well violate the spirit of the Constitution as originally drafted by the founding fathers."
2,Not bright enough for me,"Note: I have posted this same review to the product pages of all the products listed below.I reviewed the following products, and have listed them in my order of preference:1. Cateye TL-LD610-BR 5-LED Rear Bicycle Light ([...])2. Planet Bike Blinky ""7"" 7-Led Rear Bicycle Light ([...])3. Cateye TL-LD150 LED Bicycle Tail and Safety Light (Red) ([...])1. Was definitely the brightest. It was also the best-built, with the most number of blinking options. It's easy to attach and change the batteries -- all around a good design. The bicycle store clerk also said it was the brightest he had. But they're expensive.2. Is the best bang-for-your-buck. It's less designed, and not as bright, but still bright enough.3. I wouldn't recommend this one. It was significantly less bright than the other two."
4,"At Last, an Adjustable Clamp","It's a gamble buying tail lights because seat post size varies so much. Mine is a largish 31.8mm, and most lights won't fit. This light has a plastic 'radiator hose' style adjustable clamp. I didn't use (or need) the soft rubber spacers included with the light, and because of that it slips on the seat post. A little bit of electrical tape under the clamp should take care of that.It doesn't shine to the sides as much as I'd like.One nice thing is the on/off button: You don't have to cycle through the different flash patterns to get to ""off"". One long hold on the button turns it off, or turns it on to the last used flash pattern."
3,Good light for the money,This is a very good tail light for the amount it sold for. Relatively bright and the different settings are a plus and will alert vehicles behind you or even other riders. I would suggest though if you live in a very dark area or plan on riding where there is little to no street lights to invest in a different light so you can be more noticeable.
5,Excellent product,This light is very bright and very easy to install. There are several options for the light mode as well. Quick shipping too.
4,Cateye TL-LD150 LED,Overall I'm very satisfied with this light. Installation was slightly challenging once I figured out how the strap worked.
5,there should be more of these,"This simple device is great for 2-person foot care.Attn engineers: there should also be a roller-on-a-stick version:where one end of 10"" stick is the handle, the other end the roller(functionally like the de-lint rollers for clothes, but with thewooden wheels (or a single roller with ridges/studs))."
3,Country style usa dvd 4,"I really like these old shows. The video and sound quality are both good. The problem that I have with this dvd is that Faron Young hosts all 13 programs and except for Patsy Cline, Skeeter Davis and a young Buck Owens, the guests on the other shows are not that well known."
5,Dead Souls,An absolutely amazing book!!!!! I couldn't put it down..... Intriguing and terrifying from beginning to end!!!!
2,cute but hurtful,"These shoes looked good, but part of the decorative metal button pokes through to the foot. Even without this issue, these shoes aren't comfortable."
5,Excellent Resource For Calculus and Physics Students!,"""Galileo: His Science and His Significance for the Future of Man"" by Albert G. DiCanzio should be required reading for each physics student starting at the high school, for some, or college freshman, for the rest, level. After reading several dozen books either translated from Galileo's work(s) or written about him, I find this book the best for the student of 2000. A better lesson for my engineering physics students to understand a sense of basic physics relative to that of the last twenty years does not exist."
5,Jeweled Visions,"Asian rhythms and lush landscapes envelop you into a world of mystery and wonder. Categories of ""computer animation"" and ""New Age"" poorly describe these magical fractal dreamscapes. You journey through an intimate wonderland of dark and sunlit places as you submit your body to the languid pulsations of the hypnotic music. HIGHly recommended."
2,Booooring,"Here is another example of where 90's-era digital animation ends up being mundane. Even with the decade or so that has passed since the brief explosion of digital animation releases, I still enjoy watching the good ones (Gate to the Mind's Eye, Televoid). This one doesn't count.The effort that went into this work was obviously tremendous, so you can't fault the quality. It's also fairly unique in mixing animation with real imagery shot on location.But it's just so dull. I suppose if you've had a really bad day and wanted to watch (and hear) something soothing, this would be a good choice. I, although I certainly have my share of hectic days, want my animation to be gripping, weird, and fun. Illuminated Manuscripts is just high-tech yoga."
3,Acid flashback,"This video was a little disappointing. I got it for my son who is an illustration student. He found it kind of corny....it was not really ""state of the art""...to me it was like a flashback from the sixties. Groovy!"
2,Not as inspiring as it should be,"I had high hopes for this DVD, but it falls short only because the material is SO repetitive. There are a few unique effects, but its all stuff we've seen over and over again. Basically, John Banks layers Photoshop images and animates them for video. Not very inspiring, but beautiful none the less."
2,images + music is not enough to make a nice dvd,"I like computer animations and I like new age music but this dvd was dissapointing to me. The images looked more like real Earth landscapes electronically transformed into some psychedelic visions. They were accompanied by some instrumental music. Would it be good for meditation? Perhaps, but for me the music is enough on such occassions, I do not want my mind to focus on the video."
1,My First Impression - Waste of money.,"Would like let you know that my below review is after listening to it only once. So if you have heard real good review and would like to give it a try.. then go ahead and buy.I didn't like bit from the time I played. In fact I wasn't planning to buy this at all. I was buying ""AniMusic"" DVD after watching it on PBS and this was shown as a another good DVD to buy along with. I went ahead and purchased it since I saw the rating to be 4 and 1/2 stars. Now I wonder I shouldn't take the rating so seriously. I feel that its not worth to buy. When there are free music files available on net for free which sounds much better than this. Paying money to get this visualizations is useless to my knowledge.Just to give you a hint, video is something like a visualization available in any multi media player software in your PC. BGM didn't sound great either."
1,I don't recomend this DVD.,"Out of 6 Computer Animated DVDs I purchased recently, this was the worst. Why? The graphics were nice, music was nice (if you like Eastern music), but the continuous and constant display of symbols and writing on the screen through out every song got on my nerves! I could undestand a display of symbols every now and then, and on certain songs, but the display of symbols and writing continued through out the entire DVD. It didn't make any sense at all !!! And, unless you understand the language, which I assume it was middle eastern or Indian, I have no clue as to what is being stated! [...] If I am going to read something that is being forced on me, at least let me understand what it is !! I didnt buy this DVD to read slogans, and I dont recomend it for purchase, unless you are from the middle east, and like to read a constant display of writings."
3,Potent sound,"This mouthpiece gives you a potent lead sound, in tone, but is a little bit difficult to produce soft sound, and the embochure position changes using this mouthpiece. If you uses traditional mouthpieces for other music styles it will be difficult to switch to the Asymmetric."
5,Great new beading book,"This is a great book for the new beader, as well as more advanced bead work artists. You will be inspired by the photographs of the beautiful projects offered in the book. The instructions are clear and concise. I have already made several of the projects and the results are wonderful."
5,Just as wonderful as I remembered!,The Madeline series is beautiful and as I child I wanted to run away and go to a boarding school in Paris.
3,A Good Book,"There was a girl named Madeline. She was crying and she was taken to the hospital. They took her appendix out. Her friends visited her and saw all the toys, candy, and a doll house. The girls went home and said they wanted their appendix out, too. Why did the girls want their appendix out, too? You will love this book....Dylan G."
2,It's about a child with appendicitis,"In this story of a little girl who has her appendices removed, she gets lots of gifts and the other girls of the orphanage wish they could get gifts too. It didn't appeal to my 4 year old son."
5,I still love this book after so many years...,"Ever since I was old enough to read I've loved Madeline! I remember going to the library and checking out this book and all the other ones in the series (Madeline and the bad hat, Madeline to the rescue...) I was always disappointed that they were checked out. I am 21 years old now and still have an infactuation with Madeline! She is a great role model for children of all ages and the stories and lessons learned from them stick with you!I'd recommend this book for new mothers and small children alike!"
5,Essential Children's book,I wanted to have this classic in my library--especially after I was given a parody of it called Frankenstein--I thought the littlest grandchildren needed this one to understand a lot of the things in the parody. Also I like to read it aloud.
5,Wonderful book!,My three year old daughter loves this book. After all these years it's still great--nothing beats a classic.
4,Bom custo benfício,Estou no Brasil.Só compro na Amazon e sempre deu tudo certo.A entrega é imediata e sem burocracia.O produto é bom e atende às minhas necessidades.
3,Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?,"I'll catch holy heck for this--and it bothers me, because I really love Doris Day's movies, especially the Rock Hudson ones--but this CD proves only that her records were terrible.She has a nice Pop voice--warm and right in your face--but whoever selected her tunes should have been dragged through town by wild horses. 'Sugary sweet mush' is too kind, this is just syrupy junk.And her producers made a huge mistake when they tried to give her legitamacy by releasing ""Bewitched"" in a version strikingly similar to the Ella Fitzgerald ""Bewitched, Bothered & Bewildered"" record. All it does is point out the greatness of Fitzgerald's version.""Que Sera, Sera"" is more Day's speed, and it's a great Pop record. Unfortunately, you can't build a decent Greatest Hits package around a single tune."
5,Doris Day Greatest Hits CD,Any fans of Doris Day old and new will love this CD. A must have for any long term fan.
4,Old favorite,"I found this CD to be of good quality. It is one of my old favorities, as I have owned it on 33 rpm, cassette, and now CD."
2,Better Doris Day collections exist than this tired old one!,"Soundwise, this CD is sadly lacking. ""Everybody Loves a Lover"" appears on ""Hard to Find Jukebox Classics: 1958 Pop Gold"" on the Hit Parade label, and ""Teacher's Pet"" appears elsewhere, both in true stereo, whereas this CD is all mono (albeit from a rechanneled stereo master tape). ""Secret Love"" was mastered from a vinyl record, as scratches are audible throughout. All tracks have reverb not heard on the original vinyl issues due to rechanneling. The collection to get isGolden Girl: Columbia Recordings 1944-1966a two-CD set that offers most of Doris Day's 1950s singles and film favorites, as well as those from the '60s. ""Everybody Loves a Lover"" is still mono, but the audio sources are from the original mono and stereo masters and they sound terrific! Skip this old ""Greatest Hits"" collection and get a later, remastered release."
3,bought as gift,Bought as a gift for my parents. They enjoyed the album very much and reminisced about days gone by. Listen to it often
5,I love it,I'm very happy with the purchase and appreciate the easy access through Amazon for a wide variety ofgood music. Thank you.
5,Doris Day,The CD of Doris Day is great. Received quickly and as advertised. Vendor was very prompt and we are enjoying Doris's beautiful music. She seems to have a laugh in her voice on all of her songs.
3,Sticky,I found this spray adhesive to be difficult to use and will in the future use a paint on adhesive. It goes on easily and evenly but cleaning up overspray can be a problem. Don't let it get on your hands because it's really hard to get off. Like I said will use a different product next time although if you have to use a spray adhesive this is plenty sticky and did the job.
2,"This is not a toy. Has its good and bad qualities, but not a toy.","This product does exactly what it says it will: it applies a layer of sticky upon which it is possible to reposition items.It also holds quite well.Those are the upsides: does what it says it will, and does it rather well.The downsides: once you have applied this product to something it is nearly impossible to remove it. Soap and water, rubbing alcohol, nail polish remover: it laughs at all of them. You can scrape it off surfaces, but that's about the only way to get rid of it; WD-40 works too but it requires a lot of product.And overspray is quite difficult to avoid, as it does not come with a tube applicator.Classroom use, particularly by younger children, is a nightmare to contemplate. Why this product is labeled a ""toy"" is beyond me."
1,Didn't work for me,I tried to glue fabric to cardboard and foil to cardboard and it didn't work for me. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
2,Networking with the Affluent,Book is OK if you're a broker or sales person. I'm sure it's useful for some people. Expected more of interpersonal relationships with the wealthy. Maybe I just didn't get it.
3,Okay,"Was looking for a craft board so that I could out things on it when not using them, thread, scissors and stuff. Believe it or not the board is too sticky. Do not buy it for anything other than it is advertised to do."
3,A good book but the formating got in the way,"There are some gems in this biography of President Snow, his conversion to the Restored Gospel is extremely inspiring.So why only three stars?Simple. The poor lay out just gets in the way of my being able to enjoy reading the book.It looks like the text was simply uploaded onto the Kindle from a MS Word format. You could drive a fleet of trucks between the paragraphs, the space is that large.The sad thing is that Amazon does provide a formating guide for would be Kindle publishers; it's a shame that this book doesn't follow suit.Hopefully there'll be a better edition at some point. When that edition comes, I'll raise the star count to the ""I like It"" catagory."
3,For the non ambitious beginner,"I found this book to be too basic. The book would be perfect for those who are wondering if they can finish a triathlon, not for those who are trying to improve thier performance. Lot's of basic information. No specific advanced info!!"
3,good for the price,"Apparently file cabinets weren't really built to ship, the first one I received was crushed from the top, so much that the top drawer didn't open, the company quickly sent out a replacement, which has a big dent in one side panel but this does not effect its function and luckily is on the side up against another cabinet so I didn't ask for a replacement, a third one came with a much smaller dent, again hidden against another cabinet. I now have two fully functional and seemingly sturdy file cabinets, with hidden dents. Aside from the shipping/ damage issue they seem to function very well."
4,radio review,items preformed as advertised............shipped in a timely manner....no problems what so ever. GREAT DEAL!!!
3,Good product but low reach,I love these when using them all over our farm but they won't reach the hilly 1 mile to the neighbors house. Maybe I was asking too much??? Great durable product otherwise!
1,What a mess!,What a mess! I don't know what to say. 6 miles? not even half a mile!! As simple as that.Thanks!!
2,Not sure if it covers 6 miles,"works fine within apt complex. But when I tried using it on the road, I couldnt hear the voice when I was 2 miles away"
3,Short stories with a twist,"The ghosts dance in the grave yard at night in this type of story.The witches curse children and tigers eat the mean school teachers.The stories told at campfires to scare green hornsare given new like like headless horsemen.Some are pretty good, others I've read before in other anthologieswhere sci fi meets fantasy.I'd probably give it as better rating as these are some classics,but I just don't like this sort of mythology.The troll under the bridge is one of the oldest sortof stories."
5,insufficient information,"Product was as shown, but did not provide enough information. It is a double feed spool and cannot be used on some of Black and Decker's AFS Grass Hog Trimmers. It cost me $2.56 in return postage to find this out. I have a HBP18-OPE which is a single feed battery powered unit"
2,frustrated and disappointed,"I thought of purchasing this replacement housing but can't get the original Auto feed housing off my GH 1000.Yes, I removed the centre screw and pried on the unit!Having the same problem as many other owners of this poorly designed product (Black & Decker GH 1000 Grass Trimmer).Used very little...throws line out and chops it up.Yes I am using round line .08"" .**Is there a tap and go head that will fit this Model??Does anyone make a decent product anymore?No,you no longer get what you pay for!"
4,As advertised,"This was just what was needed to replace a broken spool cap on my Grasshog XP. The instructions were not very good and I had to wrangle the old spool a little harder than I was expecting. But once off, the new one installed easily enough and worked great all summer!"
5,Water-on-demand,"The product works as expected; the flow of cold water from the hose going into the heater smooth. The system does have a flaw, it needs to be tightened well otherwise water sprays everywhere."
1,Only used 3 times and it stopped working,"Very Frustrating machine. It just stopped pumping water. I found an article on line that said it may have blown a fuse (nothing about the fuse in the manual) Sure enough the fuse was blown (I had to remove the whole cover, 7 screws and cut a water proof seal off the fuse to remove it and replace it. No simple matter getting it all back together.) After I replaced the fuse there was a few clicking noises but it still will not pump any water (let alone heat any water). Even the short time it did work if the battery was low you were out of luck. You can not run it off the charging cords. I sure isn't reliable. Very disappointing."
3,Needs tweaking!,"Finally used the hose connector for the Hot Water on Demand. Thankfully , had read another review by a plumber who suggested washers, plumbing tape and really tightening it. The thing will spray out more water than not without really working at it. Got a super cold soaking one cold night before I was able to make it stop leaking! Would have been simpler for them to make it properly to begin with. Its usable since there is no alternatives."
5,does what it is supposed to do.,"Works great. Keeps us from constantly refilling the water jug that came with the Coleman water heater. You do need access to a water source that a hose can attach to, of course."
2,Cautious,"I have use an older version of this softaware and found it to be awkward as will many business plan software. Most bus plan software in general tries to make a basic task, that can be time consuming, but relatively straight forward, simplier. Actually a good MS Excel and MsWord templete would do the same thing. I have reviewed several types of BP software, I don't think any of them would making my job much easier."
1,Don't buy this program if you are running Windows XP,I bought this program looking forward to an easy start to a business plan for an expansion project with my existing business. Business Plan Pro 2003 has NEVER worked with my Windows XP operating system. I have contacted Palo Alto customer service and technical support and have still not been able to resolve the problem. There response is that it is a third party problem with a XP update. They have been trying things and having me change set ups on my system and guess what? IT STILL DOESN'T WORK!!! I am stuck with a program that doesn't work and now no one will stand behind it.
3,Unable to import from Excel,"I was unable to import from Excel to the locations I need to, otherwise the program was good."
3,The worst customer support I've ever encountered,"The software promises free links to various resources. When I tried the links I was asked to pay. I contacted online support, but they came back with an answer unrelated to my question which they oviously didn't read. Other attempts to contact customer support were ignored. I gave the software 3 stars because I did get a good looking plan out of it."
5,Why write a plan without it?,"As I approached the task of writing a business plan for a new business venture I was getting involved in, I debated trying to write the plan just using Microsoft Office or using a software product. Boy am I glad I found Business Plan Pro. It's excellent instructions, examples, and wizard-driven process had me breezing through my plan quickly and easily. I could see my progress as I went along, and it took all my questions about what makes a good business plan away.I'm so glad I chose this product instead of trying to do it all on my own. Don't make the mistake I almost made!"
5,Short summaries of a wide variety of literary works,"This is a useful reference work containing short summaries of a wide variety of literary works. Generally the entries are classified according to ' work' but in some cases according to ' author'. The editors cover the following categories,Bible,East European,French, German , Graeco- Roman, Hebrew- Yiddish,Italian, Netherlands,Oriental ,Philosophy, Religion, Russian,Scandinavian, Science, Spanish, Portugese, Latin American."
1,Don't read this version!,"Although this is generally a good read, I strongly urge everyone not to read this version of it, or at least to avoid the commentary by Ms. Odden. The endnotes to this edition ruin the endings of no less than three novels: this includes ""Hard Times"" (!), ""Bleak House"" and ""Clarissa"" by Samuel Richardson. I don't know how this was allowed to pass through the final screening, but I was extremely displeased with my experience with this particular edition. Please, buy a different version!"
3,Super Reader,"The second of the Lord Grandrith novels, with the same conceit. The book is part of his autobiography, changed a bit by the author to protect people.Most of this is military, really, as a parachute jump and some squad level actions are made by Grandrith as they assault the Nine, with casualties on both sides, before meeting up with Doc for the final book."
4,Pretty sturdy for a Plush,"I had some concerns about this plush because the necks of Ghidorah looked like they might be floppy. I was surprised to find it very flexible and sturdy. The sound is OK, but not exactly like the Ghidorah trill."
1,awful,did not work and looked as if it was very used and worn had to buy another.thank you for asking me.
2,Sigh.....,"When I took it out of the box I was so happy! The toy was bigger than I thought and well put together. Then I tried the sound......and I tried it again.......nothing. The darn thing didn't make a single grrr. Sent it back the next day.I gave it two stars because it is really cool looking. But for the price, it should work."
3,King Ghidora Plush Toy,"My son, the Godzilla nut likes this toy. Its the only one we let him bring to bed. Its not very noisy so I like that too."
1,Pulp Fiction,"As a 50 year resident of Ketchikan, I was curious how a ""tree hugger"" would portray the fight for the Tongass--known in these parts as the fight for a reasonable standard of living. Ms. Durbin quotes environmental organizer Donald Ross on page 172: ""It doesn't take much, when you're a congressman from Kansas and you've never heard of the Tongass, to get you to vote for trees."" When all is said and done, that was the tactic of the environmentalists. On page 246, she says, ""Most who did [find job after the Sitka mill closed] were forced to make do with a lower standard of living than they had become accustomed to on pulp mill wages."" How easily she dismisses the plight of those who live in the Tongass. There's a lot Ms. Durbin doesn't mention like the fact that only the wealthy and refugees from the 60's can afford to experience up close & personal the pristine beauty of the nation's First Park. The environmentalists have won. Sierra Club, kiss my ax!"
4,"Good, of course, but not as well structured as his others","The artwork is amazing of course, but the book's structure seems a lot more chaotic than Chung's other works. The material is a bit more confusing as well....but it is still excellent."
2,Not sure this one works,"I have several of the boks from this series and I do like most of them - apart from this one. This book contains the more idiosyncratic Zen stories. The main problem is that if you haven't understood those stories before you might not really understand them after having read this book. This is mainly due to the stories' nature and, of course, not due to the way the artist presents them. I did know some but not all of the stories before I read this book. I found that the ones I knew were presented in a nice way but I had doubts the comics made them clear. So if you want to learn more about Zen you might want to get the ""Shouts of Nothingness"" book from the same series and another book, maybe one by Suzuki. Zen is a hard topic to talk/write about in the first place and putting the hardest bits into a format like this doesn't really seem to work.PS: If you understand the stories why would you want to read any book about them anyway?"
5,Great book if you can get it.,I came upon this book by luck from an old friend back in the 80's. It's awesome to read.
5,This is where the show really started..,"Words can't describe how much I love this show. I've wanted to get all the seasons for a while and when I started looking around to see how much they were I couldn't believe how inexpensive they were on here! This show has it all. And I love watching them all grow up over the years, it's cool."
5,Good Show,"My daughter ordered this Series for herself and she loved it, the video arrived in great condition and she is very satisfied. Thank you."
5,Great show,This whole box set is fantastic...I will be purchasing other episodes in April for a birthday. LOVE the show and the speediness of delivery.
5,"Liked season 1 better, although this was quite funny!!!","I liked season 1 better, even though season 2 was just as funny. Looking forward to season 3 in a few weeks!!!"
3,Helpful guide,"We used this book at APROVACA, an orchid conservation center in El Valle de Anton, to ID and label orchids in the garden and prior to returning them to the forest. The pages with the photos finally fused together but we still used what we could. I have finally reordered it for the center.The book explains very scientifically the steps you take to differentiate one species from another which is helpful since at times we get orchids which may not have been identified before. It at least gets us closer to the species name.I do agree with the previous post in some ways. There are better books for the home gardener in the tropics. Here in Panama, I love ""Cultivo de Orquideas en climas tropicales"" by Gaspar Silvera. It is in Spanish with some English support. It gives easy to follow growing instructions for planting medium, water, and light for many species commonly found here."
4,Brad's the Best!,"Brad Paisley is so intelligent and talented. I'm a huge fan of his music and I think these videos are the perfect complement, as they are both humorous and poignant. In trying to explain why I think he appeals to so many, I decided its because his music is ""old school"" with an optimistic twist!"
3,good,this was a christmas gift for some one and it seamed like just the right thing. We are a fan of his music as well
5,The Entire Series Is on Its Way,"This collection features four randomly selected episodes from ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" show. If I were you, I'd wait for the entire series. It's coming to DVD around December 2014. Sam Nelson, Ricky Nelson's son, is restoring the entire series.)"
2,Slow and hot,"This portable runs very, very hot underneath (there are two warning stickers). Within a few minutes of booting, it is uncomfortably hot on the bottom side.It is slow.The screen is just very average.The keyboard is OK...typically cramped.The USB ports are, unfortunately, on the back...as are other connections.Relative to my other portable (at 4 pounds) this is just not sufficiently lighter to convince one of the inconvenience of not having the CD ROM etc.I am sending this back."
2,"looks great, performs poorly","I bought this computer after having used two sonys one ibm and one compaq. By far, this is the lightest and best looking of them all. However, the performance is so poor, its slower than the sony I used two years ago. It takes about 3 mintues for the computer to load and another three minutes to shut down. This may not sound like much time, but considering that this computer is less than one week old with no new programs installed, its really slow. The speakers are not so great either. And with only two usb ports, I will have to buy an extension if I want to run a mouse, an external CD and a video camera simultaneously.Overall, its a good buy, considering its super low price. But if you mind the speed, or lack thereof, purchase something else."
2,not thrilled,"I bought this, thinking that a metal card file would be nicer than a cheap plastic one. I was wrong. It's a cheap metal box. The sides aren't straight, and are not well put together. The lid does not close straight. The picture shows tabbed dividers with the cards. Don't be fooled - if you use tabbed dividers, like I do, you won't be able to close the lid completely. I ended up buying a plastic one that actually has room for all my cards, and the dividers."
4,"not the best, but right up there",a real handy book for building these. the only reason for 4 stars is everyone can improve
3,Boone and the Frontier,"Daniel Boone was a long hunter and it brought him to the hunting ground of Kentucky. He hunted the land several times before he brought his family to Boonesborough, a fort on the Kentucky River. Faragher shows that Boone was a man of character. He loved the frontier and wanted to be a part of it. He wanted to live in peace with the Indians but at times he found them to be his enemy. The people he encouraged to come west began to crowd him and he began to look for a new frontier farther west. The Author was very factual about the man, Daniel Boone. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
3,Not What I was Looking For,"I needed a more concise reference on specific critical care issues. This book surprised me by being hard-cover and very large. It is more like a Harrison's or Conn's Therapeutics, with a slant toward hospital care, written at about medical school or intern level. It contains whole chapters on Bayesian theory and utility analysis. I didn't want to have to sift through the general medicine background and bread and butter conditions, to get to the diagnosis and management. Maybe it would be more useful in CDROM searchable format."
3,"Great idea, not that useful",I thought I'd get away with having to apply one less lotion by buying this two-in-one product. We needed sunscreen most of the day and bug repellant only at dusk. The smell of the citronella throughout the day is a turn-off. I'd highly recommend buying CA Baby sunscreen without the bug repellant.
2,For Basie aficionados only,"If you expect some spectacular insight how Basie and his music came into being, you're in for a slight letdown. The book has a somewhat sedate pace, doesn't feature to many anecdotes or details about Basie and his musicians. There are certainly some interesting facts but on the whole it's rather dry. The book covers Basie's career from its beginnings. I found the chapters on his early life the most interesting ones. From about 1940 onwards Basie structures his memories along his recording sessions; and this gets a bit tedious. I can only recommend this for true Basie aficionados who want to pick up the odd piece of new information."
3,The book of lists,"I'll admit to being a bit dissappointed by this book about Basie.As mentioned in some of the other reviews, you get list after list of recording dates and tour dates, interesting, but not enlightening. Where are the road stories? I feel I've learned more about Basie from other peoples books about jazz and Kansas City than I did in this book. It's too bad, I'm sure he could have filled a few books with what he saw in 60 plus years of jazz."
2,How Did They Do It?,"How did Albert Murray and Dan Morgenstern manage to write an uninteresting and at times boring book about the great Count Basie? This is a sanitized and unemotional look at Basie's career. It is full of details that can only be of interest to a Basie historian- and that's about the only good thing you can say about it. I guess The Count wanted it that way. If you want to read everything about Basie that's ever been written, then buy this book. Otherwise, skip it."
2,Good Morning Blues,A bit of slow read - especially for such a lively topic. A lot of mundane details about his early days. Expected more.
4,"Useful, but...","Several of the previous reviews report that this book contains a comprehensive set of details concerning the latest in sophisticated American military technology, along with high quality photos and diagrams. This is true.After reading through this, though, I think it is also worth noting that it is not particularly well written. So far as I can tell, the facts are accurate; however, it is written in a very elementary style (basic grammar, awkward sentence structure, high in jargon, low in descriptors, etc). This could be good or bad, depending on how you look at it.Just thought I'd mention it."
5,great music!,I bought this for Ballad of the Alamo. Loved the entire album. Every song is worth the cost.Marty Robbins is the best balked singer ever.
5,Marty's the Master,"I, too, listened to my father play this album as a child. He didn't own a lot of records, but his choices were classic. This is my absolute favorite Marty Robbins, and I love to just sit back & listen, or sometimes I take out my guitar & sing & play these tunes. These are the songs that inspired me to play guitar in the first place. How can you not love him? What a voice! I ain't no Marty Robbins, but I do him justice, or so I've been told, and if the Texas Ranger in Big Iron isn't the coolest dude ever, I don't know who is. My all time favorite song line is when it goes, ""was an Arizona Ranger wouldn't be too long in town"", as in I'm taking this bad guy down fast, quick, & in a hurry, & don't mind announcing it ahead of time. You gotta listen to the lyrics...they are so cool. And if the Ballad of the Alamo doesn't make you cry, you are one hardhearted human being. Wonderful Songs."
1,Don't bother with this one....,"Here it is folks.Another bland been- there-done-that romance film.Telling by the critics reviews and the ones on amazon, I will not be seeing this film anytime soon. Why do you ask? Well, one thing for sure, it has Hilary Duff in it. I'm no fan of Duff's-Lizzie McGuire was enough. It's a great show, actually, but Duff didn't want to be known as Lizzie for the rest of her life, so she left the thing that made her famous and went to something mediocre.Bottom Line:Duff, stick to TV and avoid music and movies. You will be saving a third world country. :D"
4,Not The Best I've Seen From Hilary...,"I just saw this movie at a local movie theater. It was not as good as I thought it were to be. However, the movie is still good. This film is meant mainly for adults, but anyone at any agewill enjoy it. The film is about a family who moves from Wichitato Brooklyn because of their single mother's love life. When Jean(the mom) finds the love of her life, Jean's older daughter, Holly, doesn't feel comfortable with him, so she makes up ""the perfect man"" who is currently off in China so Jean will stray away from her current date. The film shows the consequences of meddling and the meanings of family and friendship. One of the reasons I gave this movie four stars is because it frequently goes back and forth between one man to another and I don't knowwho's who. Overall, this movie was a great one."
1,would give it 0 stars if i could,this pathetic excuse for entertainment was so stupid and putrid. i had to take an enema after watching. avoid at all costs.all copies should be burned.
3,Mushy,"This was a nice enough movie, but not nearly enough Chris Noth. Is he ""The Perfect Man?"" At least I thought that's what it was about and he's barely in it. On the other hand what scenes he's in are the best. I'm not disappointed in the movie, just that he's not in it enough. Otherwise, if you like mushy, feel-good movies, this one's for you!"
5,Hil rocks!!!!!!!!,"I adore this movie! My mom thought it was only okay, but I loved it! It is the best movie I have seen in a while. My only arguement is that Heather Locklear, (Hil's mom), acts stupid and won't listen to her daughter. Hil, on the other hand, rocks in this movie! I love her character,(Holly), and I love her! I can't wait till she makes more movies. If you are a fan of Hilary Duff,then see this movie!!!!"
1,Get new agents ladies,"I just saw this movie for the first time. It was so bad that I couldn't stop watching it and that it the only nice thing I can say. Whatever were these people thinking when they wrote and read the script? It is cheesy. Choppy and not at all cute, which is what normally saves a chick flick."
1,"Yeah, whatever....","I am actually a Hilary Duff fan. I was actually really looking forward to this movie, but after discovering what this movie has to offer through reviews, I probably will never see it, not even when it comes out in rental stores or the dollar theater.I'll give you my reasons:1. After reading the review on www.screenit.com, I came to the conclusion that this movie should be rated PG-13 and is not really a family film.2. There is a gay guy cast as one of the main characters and this kind of behavior should not be endorsed.3. From what I've heard about this movie, it sounds bland, boring and a movie that should be skipped.So there are my reasons. Please save your money and don't go see this movie. Instead, see one of Duff's other movies such as Raise Your Voice, A Cinderella Story, Cheaper By the Dozen, Cadet Kelly, or Lizzie Mcguire. I hope that the next time Hilary Duff will not compromise and be in a movie as terrible as this one."
2,Rental Only,This is the weakest Hilary movie I have seen. Suggest you rent it before considering purchase.
3,A predictable but that's the point fluff movie,"Ok this movie is not supose to be a good movie and it makes it and ok movie. Ok the movie is predicatable, stupid ok really stupid at times but that's the point. If your watching this and Hilery Duff is in it you cant expect much but again that's the point. I actually liked it when you turn off your brain and when you do it's a perfect fluff moive. At times Hilery Duff is mean and you think that no one would be doing this. When the movie was released it bombed in the box office. Well it's a dvd movie to watch onces."
2,No real punch,"It's hard to tell if this movie is meant for kids or for adults. It suits neither. In the ends it's boring and just a rehashing of past romantic comedies. It's not even good, and as far as Duff movies are concerned, it was pretty bad. It tries to please the adult and the tween, but manages to please neither."
1,Really bad movie,"When are these Disney chicks gonna get a life? Do kids even understand it's close to impossible to getting a decent apartment in NYC? Do they have any idea that moving is really expensive? Can a mom work at a bakery to support 2 kids like that? Obviously Hilary likes some kid at school and the mom isn't gonna go out with the dad because he dosn't really shine until the end. ""Oh yeah by the way, before the credits come on, will you marry me?. And some of this material is from other shows.Did it hurt?"" was from a Jimmy Neurton episode on tv. And a bunch of these that go on in this movie seem so familiar it's not even funny. Hilary, get a life. Nobody sees her movies so why still make them? Looks like her singing broke a couple windows..."
1,Duff and Locklear are so annoying....,"There may have been movies where mothers and daughters were cast well, this was not one of them. I can not say which is worse. Duff who sounds like an airhead, or Locklear who tries to be a serious actress and comes across in this movie as little more then a wooden tree."
2,"Boring, Lacks details. Reads like a poetry book",I found this book to be quite boring. It lacked detail. The author never wrote a word about any of his comrades as if they didn't exist. It was like he was the only one there. It was very surreal as if the author was in a constant dream. If you want to read a great first person account try Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer.
4,Underrated and Underpriced!,"A very candid look at life in a hopeless situation on the battlefields of the eastern front. Because this was written before the author had time to reflect after 20 or 30 years like most memiors, it is honest and does not ask for forgiveness. This book gives a true inside to life as a Gernan soldier in world war two. This one is different though because in most memiors the author spend at least a chapter apalogizing or dening knowledge of Nazi atrocities. Because this book was written during the war it is brutally honest and has not been molded by time. It shares a consistant theme with many other German memiors as to life in the front, but this one is depressing and transforming. Worth a read and well worth the money!"
2,soldier-poet wannabe,"This book has a great cover and not much else. If the actual combat could be condensed into a smaller book, it would be about 15 pages long. Unfortunately, one has to painfully sift through some pretty bad prose or attempted poetry. He's like the Bonnie Parker of the German Army. His references or image to us wearing a mask were so redundant I could have screamed. I'd bet he used the ""mask"" image no less than 20 times, and in a small book that's 19 times too many. I only wish it could have been a true combat memoir and not a failed attempt at a Hemingway/Sasoon legacy. I truely wish for his sake that something better did book-wise come from his experiences."
5,For business or home use,"I originally used this product because it came with my computer, back in 1995. It was so simple to figure out that I ended up using it for all my professional work. It is interchangable with most other programs such as Adobe Photoshop, MS Word or even with the internet. I can do touchup on photos, add a wide variety of text, do newsletters, brochures, flyers, you name it. I have purchased other software that claimed to be better and to tell you the truth, this was the easiest one of the bunch. I have upgraded each version when available with absolutely no problem. The saved data automatically went into the upgrades without loss of information. Definately get this!"
3,"yeah, whatever","Generally I love Microsoft stuff, but not so much this time. I'm not into learning curves and not a graphic designer. I just want to do a certain job and move on. I found this program adequate to do the job, but a pain for doing something so simple as centering or aligning. I had hoped for better, especially for the money. If you create something and find that you have to share the file, there's a good chance the recipient won't be able to open it.In all fairness, there are a bunch of pre-made cards, forms, etc, that I'm sure are simple and quick - maybe even wonderful - if you use them. I had a self-designed, specific, 2-sided luggage tag I tried to make that turned out o.k. at best but took way too long to make."
3,trunk trouble,"My 4 month old loves these toys! She loves to pull the monkey legs and put the feet in her mouth. She loves to chew on the elephant trunk. However, I think the trunk is way too long, she chokes on it!!"
4,Cute Toys...,"I bought this set for my son because I thought it was a good deal for three new toys. The butterfly and leaf set isnt all that fun for him. He plays with the monkey most of the time, but he likes to play with the elephant toy as well. The monkey and elephant wash up well in the machine - I recommend putting them in a mesh bag."
3,Not an attention keeper,"My son lost interest in these toys fairly quickly. I bought them for him when he was about 4 months old and he looked at them for a little while, but ended up forgetting they were around. He never teethed on them and unless I dangled them in front of his face, he just never showed much interest. Now that he's 11 months old they work well as projectiles, so I've put them up. He showed a lot more interest in the vibrating, rattly type toys."
5,My Baby's Favorite Toys,"My six-month-old daughter has loved these since she was about two months old - they were a present from a friend when she was born. They are great teething toys, completely washable, and they can hook to anything that has a handle or strap if you want (stroller, high chair, carseat, etc.) They are her favorite toys and have been a godsend on more than one occasion. I highly recommend both as a present for your own babies and as a great shower gift."
4,tiny love lots of fun,"My daughter loves playing with these toys. They hang from her play mat and one on her bouncer. She loves to chew on the butterflies, pull at the monkey's legs and put in her mouth and pull herself up with the elephantMy only problem with them is they hang too low ... swatting her in the face."
4,Happy Baby= Happy Mom,"We recieved these as a baby shower gift. My daughter, now 16 months still plays with them. She never used them as a teether. They were first bright objects that we bought other links to hang above her head at night, then she was thrilled that she could poke at their eyes without being told 'no'. Now they are 'dolls' for her to rock and sing songs to. If your child has an imagination, I suggest these toys."
4,Great Buy,"I bought this set for my son when he was about 3 months old and attached them to his Tiny Love Gym (he's 6 months now). He has really enjoyed them. They do a variety of different things - the monkey has a bell and stretchy legs, the elephant has crinkly ears, a nose to chew on, and beads to play with and bite on, and the butterflies are good to bat at, with a crinkly leaf. His favorite is the monkey because of the stretchy legs. He loves to pull on them and suck on the feet - a big deal since he's been teething for a few months now. The elephant and monkey are good for little hands to manipulate, whether on the gym or not. The butterflies are good but don't seem to hold his attention like the other two. I usually take the monkey or elephant with us when we go out. Overall, I have been pleased that these toys have kept his attention for so long. A good puchase."
4,Nice addition - could be better,Cole loved the monkey and we brought it with us most places. We watched these to his Gymini and he liked to play with them as much as he could. I think they could have done a bit more but they are one of the best out there.
4,Great toys,My daughter has been in love with the monkey since she was 2 months old. She loves its google eyes. She now uses the butterfly for teething.
5,love these,My son just loves these toys! We attach one to the strap of his diaper bag so we'll always have it on hand. He just smiles & giggles when he sees them.
5,This is an awsome toy.,I just got my daughter the bird and she loves it. She is about to turn 1 and she loves to shake it and chew on the eyes. I would recommend this toy for every child.
3,Worried about the safety of the monkey,"I purchased the monkey individually for my son at about four months old. He loved it being attached to his car seat so much that I brought it inside and let him play with it in the house as well. As he got older (around 8 months and teething) I noticed he would put the hard plastic eyes in his mouth and try to bite them off. That made me nervous enough to throw the toy away. They did seem to be attached well, but I didn't want to find out otherwise the hard way."
5,"It works, nice long cable.","It works as described, it enabled me to connect my radio to my flight sim. Basic flight controls worked fine. Long cable is a plus!"
2,"Great artist, but this offering not to my taste...","I love Rozz Williams, including his spoken word/sound collage stuff. But this is honestly my least favorite.Track #2 ""Gleichschaltung"" is a cool spoken word piece with an artsy, jazz/noir feel. Unfortunately it's the only vocal track on the album. The rest is squealing saxophone improv with various sounds mixed in. Honestly, it's quite grating after a few tracks. There are some amusing/creative moments, but overall I didn't care for it (To be fair I've only listened to it twice, maybe it will grow on me). It's worth a listen, sure. But I'd make it a low priority among this artists work.So, If your looking for some art/noise/jazz fusion go ahead. But beware there is little poetry or vocals. For that, I recommend EVERY KING A BASTARD SON (it does not disappoint.)Every King a Bastard's Son"
5,Massive Intellectual Artistry,"First lets get something strait. Im not a so called ""EXPERT CRITIC"" therefore I have no legitimate influence over your Holloywood book minds.I will tell you that I have listened to this album at least 100 times. Each of these times I have been under the influence of LSD.What can I say? I live in california...The album tells me a story each time I listen to it. To listen is to exercise the imagination.Never have i had such a treasure."
3,Not as great as expected,"This looked a lot better on screen than when it arrived. the engraveable plack was tiny and hard to read, and there is no glass to protect the signatures."
2,Fun if you like being a drowned rat...,"The concept for this tube is great in theory, but apparently it wasn't tested very well. We initially tried using this with someone who is over the weight limit. Whether we started the boat quickly or very slowly, the rider got so much water in their face, they had to let go before they could get going. Thinking it might be a weight issue, we then tried someone well below the weight limit. Though we were able to get the rider up and around the lake for a short period, anytime a wake or anything was hit, the rider got a mouthful of water. I would definitely not recommend this item to anyone."
2,Better have glass,"I tried this in some fairly calm, but not dead calm water and kept getting spashed in the face at 25 mph with every ripple I crossed. Holding on was not a problem, but really wasn't much fun. I'm going up to a lake in a few weeks and will try it again."
1,Sumo Tube -Worst Product-,this tube is so unreliable i was so anxious to try it because in the picture you can see the man gliding on the water but seriously you just swallow and swallow more water i mean i couldn't breathe so it is the worst product i ever bought.
5,Addendum to Briana's Very Good Review,"Not only Lalaine (Miranda) and Clayton Snyder (Ethan) are part of the audio commentary, also Ashlie Brillault (Kate) and Jake Thomas (Matt) participated in the audio commentary.Kees"
1,nono,waster of time and money even for teenagers !! I have no idea how this DVD found its way to my player. But fast forward way helpful.
1,Stereotypical ditzy teenagers @o@,"This show is so horrible, it makes me want to vomit beavers. The cast members can't act and everything they say is horribly exaggerated. The storylines are stupid. This series also gives off a horrible teenage stereotype, with every single boy and girl in the show being preppy, goody-goody two shoe characters. The humor is so low. ""OMG lizzie banged into a locker hahahaha!"" People say it's wholesome, family-oriented television; however it's really a worthless show that drives me insane. If I had a family member that acted like Lizzie, I think I'd jump off a cliff. As a matter of fact, the entire Disney Channel is like a huuuuge pimple. Everybody I know wants it off."
5,Can't wait for the second boxed set!,Love this show! Great family-friendly entertainment. I am anxiously awaiting the release of the follow-up sets. Good lessons and upbeat positive attitudes displayed by kids on show. Lizzie is the kind of kid you'd want as a friend for your own children.Please release the rest of the series on DVD!
5,Indeed the Greatest!,"This 3-CD set is aptly-named. These are indeed some of the greatest female vocalists of the 20th century. It is unfortunate the track listings do not also list the individual singers, but rest assured these are indeed the original songs by the original artists, women like Peggy Lee, Shirley Bassey, Vikki Carr, Judy Garland, Kay Starr, Jo Stafford, Cilla Black, Dinah Washington, Julie London, Wanda Jackson, Nancy Wilson, Keely Smith, Ruby Murray, June Christy and others. You can't go wrong with this outstanding selection!"
4,"Perfect for taking just 4"" x 6"" pictures...","I recommend for those who like using APS cameras to first try the one-time use verisons before buying this one. I have used two one-time use Kodak Advantix cameras, 35 mm single use, Poloraid instant camera, and 28 mm or 110 Kodak Cameo Camera. But I seem to like having more options and this is what came up. However, the Olympus i Snap APS camera doesn't have the Panamoric view, nor the Print H type available...just the Print C type available and that is 4"" x 6"" print type available on this camera. I remember paying alot to have a few panamoric prints being processed and that didn't come cheap. So, if you want three Print types available, then buy a used Kodak Advantix Camera instead of this one. Also, I think the resulting prints depends on what brand name film cartidge you use, the lighting, and how the exposed film is temporaily stored before it is taken in to be processed."
3,Technical description is not correct,This camera does not take 3 photo types; nor does it require any AA batteries. I'm not sure where they got this info.
1,Stylish but bad pictures,"I think that this is a terrible camera. Even though it is very stylish, it takes bad pictures. Even if you have bright lighting the pictures look dark. I would not suggest buying this camera."
3,Who is the author??,Who is the Author director of this tape? Please provide some sort of description of this tape. Thanks You
4,Great for making gravy,"This blends very easily in cold water, making it ideal for use in gravy to add a little ""oomph"" to stretch those pan drippings!I like that I can keep it in the cupboard, and it's not full of fat like so many other bouillon products.I don't give this a 5, though, because the title is misleading. There is no beef at all in this broth powder. It is a vegan product (per label), and contains no MSG."
3,You get what you pay for !,"This is not real beef broth, It is vegan. (the label says so)I TBS (table spoon) contains 250 mg Sodium ! although beef bouillon is probably the same.Maltodextrin is listed twice, as the first ingredient and as the fourth. maybe a typo?It doesn't say what TYPE of maltodextrin (wheat,rye,oat,rice) so it probably contains GLUTEN.Also contains SOY. Soy is a poor substitute for beef.Contains Hydrolyzed Plant Protein! which contains MSG! even tho the label says no MSG!Not a bad price for cheep soy broth tho, If you don't mind MSG.If they would label the type of maltodextrin and drop the Hydrolyzed Plant Protein then it would be a good (but cheep)product. As it is I cant tell if I'm allergic to the malto or not, and I don't like MSG. I wont be buying this again.To be perfectly honest I can get MSG laden Mexican bouillon at Walmart for 65 cents!In four different flavors! Beef,Chicken,Ham,Chicken and Tomato!Updated 03/29/11"
3,it was okay,product tasted ok for what I needed it for and I have ordered several products from this company and will order again but the packaging could have been better. It didnt come in a reusable bag and the bag came with alot of air in it so if you order it make sure your going to use it soon.
2,miss leading,I was disappointed that it did not say up front the the package contained a vegan substitute for chicken bouillon.
1,JUST A BAG OF SALT,"To get any flavor at all, this product is as salty as brine. So was the chicken broth. I'll probably throw both bags out."
2,Shower head,I bought this to use with the Coleman Hot Water Heater. The hose is much too short to use with a shower tent without raising the heater at least four feet.I took the fittings off and purchased a longer hose and now it works great with the heater on a more normal table height.
3,Works OK,"Tube tends to kink, especially in cooler weather. Fortunately it is a standard ID so we could buy a much higher quality and longer braided hose at our local hardware store."
5,Beautiful!!!,I saw this ring online and fell in love when I got it it was even more beautiful! I love it! not to big and not to small!!!
3,Looks Good but.....,"I bought this ring on August 26, 2012. It looked just like the picture and if you didn't look too close it also looks real. Only problem is that it has already started to tarnish. I wash my hands with soap and water, take them off when I get home and put them up, but it still tarnished. I am sending it back."
5,tdrsz1030-7 Nickel Free Sterling Silver Rhodium Plated 3mm Band 5mm...,I love the ring but haven't worn it yet . It is beautiful and small.I also like that the prongs on the ring as they are not too high.Mrs. Dyer
4,Ring is nice for the money. Size is wrong.,The ring itself is great for the money. The stones have a nice shine to them. There may be some manufacturer defects like mine arrived with a small chip on bottom of band and the center stone is set on a slant but nothing noticeable from a distance. The major problem that I've been having with ordering rings online is none so far measure true to size. I ordered size 8 the bag it came in even said size 8 but it measures at 19mm which is a size 9. I would definitely recommend this item to others just keep in mind you get what you pay for so don't expect something amazing. But i think this is worth the price.
4,cant complain for the price,"For the price of this set, a person can't complain. I wear it to ward off unwanted men from bugging me lol .. it works quite often enough. I have woman compliment on the rings and how they sparkle as if they were real."
3,Ring is pretty,"Didn't really like the setting so I have it as a back ring to my gold set, it pass for real diamonds and sparkle as long as you keep it clean"
3,Its okay,"When I first got this ring I loved it. I couldn't believe that it was so pretty for the price I payed. It didn't look fake at all, it was so shinny and it looked more like white gold than silver, also it was a perfect fit in a size 5. However after a while of wearing it the shine begin to fade. Now it is beginning to look more like costume jewelry. But I cant really complain because it was so cheap. Overall it is pretty but I just wish the shine had lasted."
2,Not very happy,I love the look if the ring but the first day I wore it to work and I'm a hotel manager so I have a desk job I picked up a stack of books and my ring bent and no one can fix it
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,"I purchased this ring to replace my lost wedding ring (put it in a safe place and don't remember where that safe place is).Shipping was okay, not slow but not fast either.When I first opened the ring box I was instantly disappointed. The ""diamonds"" look fake. ""Diamonds"" have that blue tinge to do that screams fake.When I picked the rings up, they felt fake as well. That lightweight feel you get when you hold a 50 cent ring from the store machines.I have had it about 2 weeks and both rings have already begun to tarnish.Overall, I would definitely not repurchase and I caution anyone who is looking for a wedding ring replacement or a ring to wear daily not to purchase this ring set."
2,Unsatisfied,"it looked real/beautiful on internet but when i got it, i wasnt satisfied 100% at all. This item will be my first and last order."
1,CRAP,"Turns fingers green! Completely fake, not even real metal! Would have rather wear plastic out the bubble gum machine! Not recommended!"
4,Beautiful ring!,"This ring is beautiful! I was looking for a ring to wear when I go on vacations/travel so I don't have to wear my really expensive wedding set, and this one was perfect! It looks almost exactly like my original wedding set. Very pleased with the product!"
3,A little disappointing.,"I usually love the things I order from Gem Avenue. I got rid of my real wedding set a few years ago (long story) and since then have been wearing cz sets. I ordered another set from Gem Avenue and it is amazing. I get compliments on it constantly. I thought it might be fun to have something new so I ordered this set. It's ok I guess but a little disappointing. It doesn't really look ""fake"" but it looks like a diamond set that would have been cheap because of poor quality. The rings do not sit flush together and contrary to other reviews, both my husband and myself could see the gap. The metal looked cheap and the setting seems a little off. I am going to be returning this set. I would say it's a good set to buy if you're just looking for something to wear while on vacation, but I'd recommend looking at the other sets Gem Avenue has. This one is certainly not their best."
5,awesome...,This is absolutely beautiful...very petite and elegant..it much prettier then the pic shows so I'm very pleaded and love it do much ...I have long skinny fingers so this fits and looks perfect and the sizing is exact..ty again...
4,Nickel Free Sterling Silver Rhodium Plated 3mm Band 5mm Cubic Zirconia,"This ring looks real and expensive. What can I say it's $35 bucks and not $3,500. I'm sure my son-to-be fake wife will love it."
4,MarthaMartha,"I received this ring from Amazon in a very timely manner. Its presentation was very nice. However, I did have to return it. It was smaller than the size ordered. It was a beautiful ring!!"
2,Loved it while it lasted,"The rings look great together. I really wanted to enjoy it for a long time, but it lasted about 2 weeks. First let me say that the center stone was not sitting evenly in the prongs when it arrived, but I thought it looked fine. One of the prongs got caught on something and got bent after a couple of days of wear. I bent it back in place, but it looked like it could snap off. Well a few days later it did break off and a few hours later I lost the large stone. I found the stone, but the main ring is not really wearable until I can get it fixed (add new prong). I am thinking the fix will cost as much as the ring so I am not sure what to do. The set is beautiful and I wanted to use it to replace my original set, but obviously it was not made well."
4,Great Ring!,"This ring is beautiful. I've had it for about a month now and it still shines! There is a very small gap between the rings, but I don't see what the problem with that is (it is two rings after all)! Everyone that I have shown it to cannot tell that it is not real. There is some wear on the side of the ring that rubs the other but its on the inside where you don't see it. I use it as my wedding set and wear it everyday with no discoloration and wash my hands with it on with no problems. This is a beautiful ring and I would highly recommend it :)"
2,Is this actually plastic??,"Upon opening this ring, I thought, ""wow, this is beautiful!"" And then I took it out of it's cute little box and my heart sank. It was lighter than air, and felt like it was made out of plastic. I wore it for the day, took it off that night, and realized that it was scratched where the stone on the engagement ring meets the wedding band.I am sadly disappointed in this purchase. It was cheap, and now I know why. I was unsure of whether or not I actually wanted a fancy diamond wedding set, and this answered my question, at a very inexpensive price. I now know that the traditional wedding set is not for me. I'm glad I purchased this ring first before I purchased something far more expensive.At a glance the ring is beautiful. If you don't mind feeling like you are wearing a plastic ring, then go for it. I for one need something a little more substantial and will be purchasing a Robert Lee Morris ring for my wedding ring."
1,Tarnished!!!!!,"When I first got this it was very pretty, however in the 9months I've had it it's gotten very tarnished. I would not recommend this ring to anyone."
1,Bad Product!,The diamond does not have any height to it. This ring looks very cheap. I was not empressed with this product at all. I sent it back for a refund.
1,ring,very pretty but the gold turned a different color! i will never do the cubic again online i recommend silver gold but not cubic
1,blah!,"The set was actually really nice looking. BUT, the center stone is tottally crooked! It really throws off the look of the ring and the center diamond has no height to it at all. I really dont know how to feel about this set because its a really beautiful set. But it also has a really big flaw. 50% good and 50% bad. But otherwise nice and believable. Im returning my set that i just recieved today. Not happy about the center stone at all."
4,Will keep this company in mind for the future,"I purchased these rings as a travel set for my upcoming destination wedding. They arrived quickly, and were very pretty. Unfortunately, I had been sent a different size than what I had requested. I also think I would have sent them back anyways, because the center stone in the ring was smaller than I had anticipated. However, if you're looking for a pretty, but more modest wedding set, I recommend this product."
4,ring purchase,"I bought this ring as a wedding anniversary surprise, so I was taking a guess that it would fit.To my suprise it fit very well, and she loved it. the color was nice and the whole overall look of the ring was very pretty on her."
4,"Beautiful, but too small","The ring was very pretty and believable as a diamond. However, I returned it because it was too small for my personal taste. I am 5'5 140lbs, size 6 ring, with chubby fingers. This would be perfect for someone with very slender fingers though! The center stone and the width of the bands were just too small!"
3,you are getting what your paying for...,"You are getting what you pay for... The shipping on this item was great, on time and cute little blue holder for rings. However, the rings themselves were much to be desired... First, the cz in them looked very cheaply produced. Secondly, the setting was horrible. The main stone was set flat with little to no elevation. Poorly designed overall."
2,Sad,"I loved this ring at first, It was very sparkly and realistic but I only have had it for only 1 month and two of the side stones fell out! I didn't hit it on anything. I don't even know when it happened, I just looked down and it was broken. I don't do anything that is really hard on my hands but I am a medical assistant so I wash my hands a lot and it has gotten pretty dull. I was really disappointed by this ring. I really had high expectations because of all of the rave and wonderful reviews... but now I'm just sad."
5,Wonderful money saver!,The rings are beautiful!!! They fit together perfectly. They are light weight and not very chunky which I happen to like. They arrived in perfect condition. This saved me a lot of money! I am very happy with them!!!!!
3,Pretty but---,"The ring shines beautifully however, you can tell the ring is fake by it's prongs. I was hoping it would have 4 realistic prongs holding the diamond, instead, its a ""cracker jack"" box type of prong setting."
4,Great for the price,"I bought this ring as a replacement for my wedding set. I lost my wedding band and my engagment ring doesn't fit, so I wanted something to wear until we can afford to buy me a real set. I've had this ring for about a week now and love it. It doesn't look fake and fits nice. I gave it four stars because the engagement ring is just a tad bit smaller than the wedding band. It's not very noticalbe but I am a little ocd about things like that. Otherwise, it's a great ring for the price and now my husband doesn't have to rush out and get me a new set, I'm content with this one for a while. Even if it does start to show some wear, for the price I can just buy another, no big deal. LOVE it and have recieved many compliments! :)Nickel Free Sterling Silver Rhodium Plated 3mm Band 5mm Cubic Zirconia Engagement Ring Size 8"
3,I really wanted to love this ring,"We wanted a temporary ring until I get my real rings, so I thought this one would be excellent. Upon close inspection, I noticed that the ring was beautiful, had lots of sparkle and shine BUT the stone was crooked. I figured, since we didn't spend much, and it wasn't completely obvious, I decided to wear it. I received a few compliments on it for the first couple days. Well, after 4 days, one of the side stones fell out and I just couldn't pretend anymore. It had a lot of potential as a set and engagement ring but I didn't want anything else to go wrong. Unfortunately, I had to send it back. This was just MY experience. The company has been helpful and I look forward to my refund."
3,Cute set...,"but if you order these with the expectation that they will pass for real diamonds, you will be disappointed. They look like what they are, costume jewelry. I rated them 3 stars because the prongs are not lined up perfectly and one is bent so I am going to return them. If they weren't defective, I would probably keep them because they fit nicely (ordered them a size smaller than normal) and they seem comfortable."
5,3 months later and she still loves it,"Bought this for my Fiancee' as we were in a very tight finical situation. She loves it, her friends & co-workers love it & 65 of her friends on FB clicked ""like"" after positing the picture.. We waited a few months before doing our review just to see if the quality held up.. I can say that She is like a bull in a china shop & it has survived for 3 months now lol. Well worth the $45. Our wedding is set for August, I'll update again then to let you know if it's still holding up.."
2,Was so excited until....,"My fiance bought this ring and put it on my finger a month ago. It was beautiful and we were so excited. After a month of regular wear, the band started changing colors, the band has bent, and we cannot get it fixed. Furthermore, the stone has a milky color to it and cleaning does no good. This ring has broken both of our hearts. Buyer be warned. If you intend to wear this as an engagement ring (as in one you don't take off), don't buy this ring. If you plan to wear it as costume jewelry, I am sure it will be fine."
3,"Eurotalk, good, but could improve",Eurotalk Czeck is helpful in learning the language. One can choose to repeat each phrase in order to review and learn thoroughly. It reinforces learning by displaying the written word while the word is being spoken.It is a little slow changing from one phrase to the other. It would be more helpful if some phrases were broken up and spoken more slowly.
2,Pretty but cracks immediately,"While this is a pretty cutting board, the board split almost immediately in our kitchen even though it was never placed in the dishwasher. We still use it, but I would prefer one that is more durable for the price"
5,Great Heavy Cutting Board,"It's thicker than most, but that makes it pretty heavy, so it doesn't slide around like thinner ones. The bamboo is hard, really hard since the grain is on edge (vertical), but it gives against a sharp blade, and interestingly it appears to kind of ""heal"" after an indentation is made. So far I think this is one of the greatest cutting boards I have ever used. Seems pretty impervious to oils and stains, etc."
1,Very disapointed,"I incidentally bought this cutting board from another web site without knowing its brand and item number in the first place, for $15, and I regretted for making the purchase. The board came with a large crack in the middle. Judging by the majority of other reviews, I can rest sure that this is definitely ajunck"
1,"Bought Two, Both Cracked","I purchased this as a Christmas gift in early December. It didn't ship until February, which was okay. By then I liked the way it looked so much, I bought one for myself. They both arrived within a week of one another.Both boards were treated with heated food grade oil and allowed to sit and soak it in. After wiping off the oil, my board had surface cracks, where the oil had pulled some of the glue out from between the bamboo pieces. Within the first month of use, both boards developed cracks all the way through them. Both boards were never soaked in water, but just wiped with a damp cloth.This board may be beautiful, but it quickly became unusable and a waste of money. Now I'm looking for a good hardwood cutting board. (I've already replaced the gift board with another.)All in all, this fiasco of a cutting board has cost me around $150...and I have yet to replace my board!"
1,it cracked after 5 months used,should return this cutting board from the day i received it.first I was unable to removed the glue !now it cracked right at the center !
1,"NOT worth the cash, my second one is now cracked too.","Bamboo cutting boards are pretty cool, and they do kind of heal with regular use, but this specific model is junk, I am now on my second one and it's cracked just like the first one was when i recieved it (return to amazon was great, got a new, uncracked, one in 2 weeks. but now with 4- months of use, this one has two large cracks, i can actually see the light thru them... don't spend the money on this one, please look elsewhere... even if it;s good when you get it, it won't stay that way for long, I paid 50.00 thinking i was getting a high quality product, i thought wrong.."
1,A piece of junk that is not worth it,Good day everyone. This item cracks in the center and Amazon did not let me return it as it was outside of the return period. I am completely miffed.
4,Super Board,This is an awesome cutting board with huge amounts of cutting surface. Looks great also.
3,Not What I Expected,"This is good poetry, but it IS poetry, not romantic fiction, and NOT by the Joan Wolf who writes romantic fiction (No Dark Place, Summer Storm, Difficult Truce, etc). So beware."
4,I'm Every Woman,The CD arrived in excellent condition. I enjoyed the music more than I thought I would and decided I liked the Chaka khan version better than the Whitney Houston one. The CD was not only a bargain but a musical delight as well.
5,Great review for a daunting rotation,"This was quite simply the only resource I needed for my ob/gyn rotation and shelf exam. There were very few questions on the exam that were not covered by ob/gyn blueprints, and all of those were ID/medicine-oriented (e.g., organism-specific antibiotic questions). I would recommend reading this book and only this book - read it 2 or 3 times. That is all I did, and it was one of my best shelf scores."
4,A real good book...,"Personally I need books that explain things thoroughly in order for me to understand concepts. That's why I enjoyed Goljian's pathology book over BRS pathology after having used BRS pathology for 2/3 of my pathology course. This Blueprints book lies somewhere between how factual BRS path is and how Goljian's pathology is in terms of level of explanations. It's well written and easy to understand. But, many times it doesn't take the time to explain reasons or concepts behind various pathological findings or testings or why various testing findings are the way they are. That's why I'm not rating it as a 5 star product. Otherwise it's been a pleasure reading this book."
1,Nice overview,"For 2nd year preview on OB, or a quick reference for third year, this is ok. However, it will not even come close to the depth of info on the NMBE shelf exam"
1,Wrong item sent,"For some reason there is a divided bowl and spoon pictured, and that what I thought I was ordering. Instead I got some huge spoons that I had no interest in"
3,The Time Theme,"This book has so many different themes; it is impossible to address them all at once. The concept of time is a major theme played with. This theme begins to weave into the story with these words: ""Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time."" The novel is Tralfamadorian in nature--it doesn't make sense when you look at each piece individually. It makes sense only when you see it all together at once. There truly is no beginning, middle, and end. Time is a comfort because it sees no end. Death is not an end. It is merely an unpleasant event in one's life, which is okay because there are plenty of other events in one's life in which they are very happy. This is what Billy Pilgrim learned from the Tralfamadorians. I think it is something that everyone should take away from this book."
2,Craziness,over all i thought this book was very unrealistic and very hard to follow. To be at war one moment and then to be obducted by aliens in the next moment is total craziness. I think Kurt Vonnegut is a very good writer but the subject that he was writing about wasn't something anyone could relate to.
5,New Norwood Fan,"This dude rocks! His gritty, guitar-driven, bluesy rock delivers with a big KABOOM! Texas' next guitar legend has surfaced in my opinion. If you like the Stones or SRV, buy this CD. No gimmicks here and no rip-offs either, he's the real deal. Talent, heart, and soul, all the necessary traits to become a real guitar and musical legend."
5,a Christmas Classic,"Worth is just for It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year, but the others are great as well."
4,Here's Why You Should Buy,"This CD is pure Christmas joy! Andy Williams has so much fun with these arrangements. If the ""Happy Holiday"" medley doesn't get you in the mood to do some Yuletide celebrating, you've got your ears plugged. ""It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" practically jumps out of your speakers and dances you around the room. The band really swings on this one. Just listen to that snare drum chattering away back there, softened a bit by the smooth string/flute lines and punctuated by a horn section that's groovin' high! Speaking of groovin', baby, check out the fab '60s arrangement of ""Kay Thompson's Jingle Bells!"" You'll be scramblin' through your closets for your bellbottoms and Nehru jackets, daddy-o! For some reason, just like Johnny Mathis, Andy feels like he has to get ""sacred"" for the carol portion of the album, and the digital quality of the CD is a bit flawed, but other than that, this is vintage Christmas tuneage!"
5,Classic,"Family was tuned in to current artist Christmas releases, this is a classic and all are thrilled and request this as primary artist."
5,Wonderful Music!,This CD of Andy Williams is just what I wanted. Andy Williams's voice is beautiful and he sings favorite carols. Brings back wonderful memories.
3,Not Such a Hot Album,"I was hoping to hear real Christmas music that I could relax and listen to, but this one was disappointing to me; it didn't impress me as something that was pleasant to listen to, and it didn't seem to bring out the real Christmas Spirit for what it is really about,and it was lacking the beautiful songs that I love. Sorry, but this one just is not what I like."
5,Fabulous,This is a great CD and brings back lots of memories for me. I enjoy the song selections very much.
5,A Christmas requirement!,"Christmas music is so tied in to the sentiment of the season that we who love Christmas music judge it, not by its musical merits, but by its ability to jog our memories of past Christmas seasons. A ""favorite"" Christmas album is like a favorite ornament or stocking that absolutely MUST be brought out to make the holiday complete. This is one of those albums to many, many people. Andy Williams made this album when he pretty much epitomized the cleancut, handsome, thirtyish suburbanite we admired and could relate to back in the '60's. The album is well made and has some good, classic arrangements of the standards. In my home, this is as necessary as tinsel on the tree."
1,Christmas music,This is a nice sound track but the beautiful singing of Andy Williams can hardly be heard over all the loud music. I was very disappointed in this CD and would not recommend it to anyone.
5,Excellent Cleanser,This cleans my face of oils without makiing it itch and doesn't dry my skin in the winter - I use it year round in the shower in the morning to wash my face.
4,;0),This is a re read for me as i have not left a review before for this book. this book starts the series of the sister brides. Crown Prince Jaspar went to the States to retrive his nephew Ben who was the son of his deceased brother. Upon his arrival He meets Freddy who he assume is the mother of Ben who he has read about in the reports.Freddy is actually Ben's cousin who she has been caring for since he was born. Ben's mom Erica who is Freddy's cousin has passed away. Freddy will do what she needs to in order to stay with Ben even if it means blackmailing Jaspar. Again cute read loved it its one of my favoorite series by the author. Towards the end Jaspar finds out some information about Freddy and the sisters she never knew she had which ties into the series.Storyline: FAIREnjoyment: FAIR************************
4,great book,"the book was nice but I would have loved the hear the hero's point of view, at some point in time, about the heroine but I have always loved anything written by lynne graham and I wouldn't stop now."
1,Delphi Programming with COM and ActiveX,This book is a waste of paper. It just recyclesstandard Borland information and does NOT coverCOM or Active X in a serious way.
5,Must-have winter tool,"I bought this tool after seeing a neighbor use one to almost effortlessly remove ice from his driveway that I couldn't. It scrapes up the snow and ice that stick to the pavement and are virtually impossible to remove with a shovel. (like when someone who shall remain nameless drives over the snow before you've had a chance to shovel!) The wide blade and D-grip handle make it easier to use than a standard scraper. Once you have one of these, you won't know how you got along without it."
4,A True Prep Course,My daughter is not in day care or pre-school and is 3 1/2. I was looking for something to gauge her skills and those needed for kindergarten. The checklists in the book are great and I have a sense of the skills we can be working on.
5,I want one for myself!,"I purchased this book to give to someone else as a gift -- someone from another country who might like to see a little bit of what life is like here in Connecticut. But now that I've seen it, I'm going to order another for myself. This is the most beautiful book that seems to capture the state we're from perfectly. I truly want to leave it out on my coffee table to look at time and time again and I have NEVER said that about a book in my entire life (except for personal photo albums perhaps)."
2,I was disappointed.,"Connecticut 24/7 was a disappointment to me. The cover proclaims ,""Amazing Photographs of An Extraordinaty State"". I found that approx. 50%of the photographs did not give someone a ""view"" of Connecticut , but instead were somewhat ""generic"" in what they portrayed.""a child reading a book in bed"",""a baby looking out a house window"",""children in art class"",""dogs in the back of a car"",""a man in a bathroom""Photos such as these , did not serve to enhance my visual perception ofwhat Connecticut looks like. Do not get me wrong , ""all"" the photos areindeed beautiful. It is just that I expected a book of photos of theState of Connecticut, to have each photograph show a scence that was""unique"" to Connecicut."
4,Lovely story,"This was a quiet, unassuming story that draws one in, almost by surprise. A simple novel about the intertwined personal relationships of two families on a kibbutz; for all its lack of action or high drama, it was nonetheless a very satisfying read."
3,Mountains of metric conversion tables for track,"Seems like this was serviceable once upon a time, but refinements of rules in the last twenty years, combined with the advent of the internet as the primary source for this type of information have rendered this slim little tome all but obsolete.If you need to look up stuff from on the field, and aren't blessed with a laptop, this might be a bible of reference information. In fact, I guess it's way more suitable for field conditions than a laptop will ever be.But for most track and field enthusiasts, this is an idea that the world has passed by."
4,"A great computer desk, but a bit of a pain to set up","I use this table as a desk in my home office. It really makes a great desk if you like big, pen- and coffee-proof surfaces. However, there is some pain involved beyond simply buying it. First, the table is very, very heavy. If you do not have two strong adults to move it, it *may* be more pain than it is worth. Secondly, the table requires a powered screwdriver to assemble. If you are like me and do not own one, there is the added hastle of acquiring one. However, using the powered screwdriver and assembling the table is very easy."
1,Adhesive wouldn't hold,"I followed the instructions carefully, and tried with both adhesive strips that came with the copy holder, but if fell off in mere minutes, without ever a document placed upon it. Amazon, happily, has a great return process."
4,"Good light, one flaw","This light has pretty much everything you'd expect in a good taillight: bright, good battery life, strong mount, quick release, no tools needed to change battery, and waterproof.I purchased this light because my old one was stolen, so I keep this one with me rather than on the bike. The problem lies in the switch: it is too easy to press. The light often turns on in my bag which is aggravating because it runs the batteries down."
3,Mine fell off a number of times,"It's quite good as a light, but the bracket broke after 4 months and it's gone. Before that, I found that the quick remove mechanism would also release with some bumps. Maybe it's because I can't attach it to the seat column, as it expects, but just sort of cable tied it.My solution to the quick release had worked (a cable tie around the release) but just the other day I found only the column mount left. All the mounting parts are plastic and somewhat cheap.But the light is rather good, bright, and has flashing patterns. Although the quick on/off flashing does seem to annoy drivers in cars who sometimes shouted at me.But I am willing to try again and buy another one."
5,Great product that protects you while you ride!,"I love this bike tail light and I feel safer when I use it. Every time I ride, night or day I have it on. It is extremely bright and I like the fact that it has 5 LEDs that operate in 4 modes of operation. The lights will either flash all together, be on all the time, flash side to side or my favorite the random flash. The random flash is highly visible at night and grabs your attention.These LEDs are very bright and they will operate on 2 AAA batteries. I hate bike lights that use special small round batteries. AAA batteries are easy to find, inexpensive and they will last 30 hours in this tail light.I would not ride a bike without a flashing tail light and this is one of the best you can get in my opinion."
4,Large and bright. But not great.,Good light but very large. It works well but is nearly as wide as my brooks saddle. It gets in the way of my Burley Travoy hitch and is not very versatile as far as mounting options. The mount is pretty poor too. Would I buy it again? No. There are better options including some of the other Cateye models.
5,Cateye's Best Rear Light,"Of all the lights I've used, this is the best. Very bright, long lasting batteries, but most of all the various modes will keep any car at a distance. Cateye again produces a winner!"
5,"You're an Animal, Viskovitz!","This work exudes the satirical humor of Boffa that Italian readers have come to love. The translation draws English readers into his world for the first time, introducing them to a wide range of zany characters from the animal kingdom. The translators, Casey and Sanminiatelli, clearly had fun playing with words and the work. The result: A joy to the reader."
5,"You'll laugh, you'll gasp, you'll shed a tear, but - avoid *SPOILER* reviewers!","Bold concept exquisitely realised (and translated). The saga of life in a nutshell; how long till it achieves the classic status it deserves? If Animal Farm was the classic of totalitarianism (if it now seems 'bleeding obvious' we've partly Orwell to thank) Viskovitz is surely the classic-in-waiting for our own unidealistic era, the continued existence in which of the Darwin-deniers only underscores the absolute centrality of Darwinian ideas to our world-view.And guys, the biological language is intended to bamboozle, to 'blind you with science' - some of it's even made up (real or not, I loved the fauna in the penultimate chapter). Another must-have for schools - a fun read and a good starting point for debate philosophical, ethical, scientific.An equally jolly-but-deadly-serious read is Gwyneth Lewis's Hospital Odyssey (it rhymes, but let that not put you off - like Viskovitz's, her travails are Everyman's)"
3,The jokes get old,"While the stories in this volume are quite clever, the jokes get a little old by the time you're about halfway through. Basically, the stories don't go anywhere beyond the jokes.An alternative is Italo Calvino's Cosmicomics, which doesn't try so hard to make you laugh (though it's sometimes funny), but feels more profound."
3,A limited reference,"This book has a very short description of each card's divinitory meaning and an even shorter description of the card reversed. This brevity is appealing to a person who wants to begin reading cards immediately, however it has the drawback of giving limited interpretations which can lead to inaccuracy in some circumstances. It also makes memorizing the meanings very difficult, since it does not tie the meaning in with the pictoral representation of the card. In its favor, at least it does mention the reversed cards, which not all references do. It also has a short glossery of the symbolism used in cards. All in all, though, for any beginner who really wants to learn the tarot, I'd say Joan Bunning's book is 10 times better than this."
2,Not terribly exciting.,"The ""Around the World"" single appeared in two parts, each backed with a pair of b-sides. This is part 2.The title track is a funky, driven piece, opening with a raging distorted bass run before blasting into an oddball, scratchy, funky verse. It's a decent tune, although it's on ""Californication"", so it's unlikely anyone would buy it for this.The b-sides on part 2 are a pair of live tracks-- ""Me and My Friends"" and ""Yertle Trilogy"". It's certainly interesting to hear the band tackling a pair of later songs, but by and large neither are particularly exciting-- ""Me and My Friends"" comes off better live than it does even recorded live, and admittedly ""Yertle Trilogy"" is a lot of fun, but more goofy than anything else.Invariably, collectors will want this, but more casual fans can skip this one."
3,a different way of viewing personality traits,"INTERESTING FOR THIS FIRST TIMER USING THIS ANCIENT TOOL. Not quite sure if it is furthering my spiritual journey, but not harming it either."
4,Flameless for Heat Shrink,"FLAMELESS, works great for heatshrink applications for elecrical wires (16-24 AWG) also performed well for environmental splices. Acceptible substitute for electrical heatgun when in a field environment with no electricity."
3,Hot Shots Golf,There is a lot of good info in this book but doesn't have any codes for free items. It was beneficial.
3,Simplistic,"Great for the high school or intro for a prepatory course frosh year in college. Otherwise, past the intro and the elevator story, worthless."
1,Don't bother,I found nothing worthy here. The approach to research was not helpful to me as a writer--I just don't think like that.
1,Sleeper,"This book is by far the most boring guide to research I have ever endured. Unfortunately it was required for a course or I never would have stuck with it. It provided few new ideas in terms of writing tips, nor did it focus much on qualitative research. Perhaps it would be useful for quantitative researchers."
5,Excellent mastering the art of writing dissertations,"The content of the book is special and concise for the researcher for writing. Though there are many books discussing about the writing of the dissertation, this book uses a good and informed approach to guide the reader. Hence, this book is deserved to buy and keep in the bookself at home."
3,"Not excellent, but decent.","I can't say that I was bowled over by this book, but I think a beginner would find it very helpful. The only really good critique I can give of this book is that it is not for the intermediate to expert researcher. Most will find it a bit pedestrian and very basic. To the beginner or the novice I think this book would be a very valuable tool. Buy it for a freshman in college before the go to school, they will be able to use it and it will help them."
1,"Copied disc, want my money back...","Imagine my disappointment in recieving a copied disc. The inlay is on piece of card with a photocopied graphic. No track info. I have other Giants of Jazz CD's so I know that there is something amiss. So what now, worse, it was Amazon itself that I ordered off. My theory is that the mp3 tracks have simply been burned onto a CD and the inlay scanned. I can't even find out where to complain on site."
4,so glad to hear a fresh sound!,"MoZella gives a new, fresh sound that has depth and her own style. The lyrics are thoughts that i so often have heard in my own head, and well her voice is GREAT! I am now simply waiting for the full CD to come out!"
3,Legendary mandolinist breaks out of bluegrass,"Rift is legendary mandolinist Tony Williamson's new quartet, featuring his son Hardy on guitar and vocals (and lyrics), Don Wright on banjo and guitar, and Robbie link on bass. There's a dose of bluegrass in the instrumental mix, but the songs themselves, despite their acoustic picking breaks, are anything but bluegrass, and the younger Williamson mostly sings unadorned lead in an unusually wavering style. The songs are pretty, particularly the mandolin playing, but are often too tepid to really engage the listener. A few tracks, notably the dreamy ""As I Have to Be"" and the mandolin-led instrumental ""Shangrula,"" break out of the languor to offer something intriguing. It's hard to knock someone for exploring new avenues of artistic expression, but this project doesn't provide as fetching a space for Williamson's playing as his previous works."
4,Get Moving,This tape has been a God sent to me. The songs are not popular hits but they still are up beat and somewhat relaxing. It really can makes your mind clear. The pace of walking is great and can be made as fast as you would like. The woman who talks though out the tape also says something right when I need it some encouragement. And the walk does last 30 minutes. I found this to be very good and keeps you on track.
4,Upbeat and fun,"This was a very upbeat and relaxing workout. I like to end my day this way with a walk and time to myself. The music is upbeat with an easy to follow rythm. You are told when you are halfway through the walk, so you know when to go back. Rita Moreno reminds you about posture and pacing and times a pulse count about halfway through. It was just perfect for me."
4,Good basic introduction on drivers for windows 95.,"I sure wish I'd had this book when I started out writing drivers, it would have saved me a ton of time and grief. I too, wish there were more information on specific driver types, such as soundcards, but that stuff is in the DDK anyway, once you know what to look for -- and this book will tell you that, and a lot quicker and better than the DDK will. Any of the other required tools will tell you how to install or load a VXD, so I don't consider that a big problem. I could wish that this book also covered Windows NT, but was extemely glad for the plug and play coverage, which other information sources obfuscate badly. Good information on windows innards, useful to an overall understanding."
3,Useful but frustrating,"This book is a good overview of Windows 95 VxDs. However, it was EXTREMELY frustrating to use as a guide or tutorial while actually writing a VxD.There are a large number of errors in both the samples and the descriptions of interfaces. I don't know how such glaring errors could have been published."
4,Extremely Useful,"I'm currently trying to implement a card services interface under Windows 95. This book had something useful and pertinent on almost every page I opened it at. Sometimes I found sections a bit hard to understand, but experimenting with the sample code soon sorted that out. In conclusion a very good book but perhaps a little over-priced in Australia."
3,"Useful for restoration, not a must have.",Has more than a few tidbits to help out with your older BMW. Has too many models to cover to make it a must have. You can read what is useful to your model in an afternoon. Hit your local library first.
1,In bad taste.....,"Very disappointing. I was very offended by the lude comments and suggestive themes that pervaded the movie... from the fantasy of the Tin Man to Ms. Piggy's comments about enjoying a roll in the hay with Kermit the scarecrow. I was deeply offended by the line made by the crow on Kermit the scarecrow's shoulders when he was standing with his arms out on the cross shaped scarecrow prop... jokingly the crow says to scarecrow ""have you seen the movie ""The Passion"" and then the crow says, I liked the crows and starts to peck on his face.... he is of course referring to the scene in The Passion of the Christ where the crow pecks out eyes on one of the theif's face during the crucifixion scene. VERY POOR TASTE...... SHAME ON YOU DISNEY!!!!!!Frankly I am disgusted with this movie. What happened to the warm fuzzy feeling one got from watching The Muppets. Alot more died with Jim Henson than just his body.... his spirit went too."
2,Muppets version is disappointing,"We love all the Muppet ""remake"" films - Muppets Christmas Carol is one of our all time favorites. But Muppets Wizard of Oz is a flop. The story line, in an attempt to modernize the story, is forced and awkward. A shrimp as Toto?! Maybe the movie could have been written outside the Oz storyline - just about a girl who wants more than anything to sing. But the music and script were not believable. Have to say, we did not finish the movie - we thought it that unworthy. Probably on our list of our top ten worst. Boy - were we disappointed."
1,"GARBAGE, complete garbage.","Boy was I disappointed. And I knew it was going to be bad, but not this bad. I even waited years to buy a copy. What a waste of money! We couldn't even watch the whole thing, and I'm a huge Muppet fan. The whole hip hop Ashanti thing killed the beginning and not even Kermit could pick up the pieces when he finally appeared on screen. Save your money and stay away from this bomb."
1,Waste of time,"My whole family was so excited to see this that we set the Tivo to record it the second we heard about it. After sitting down comfortably and pulling up our chairs for a fun evening of Jim Henson-style wackiness, our elation quickly turned sour. This is -- by far -- probably the biggest Muppet fiasco since Jim Henson died. It's really sad, and really pathetic.Obviously low-budget, the plot reminded me of something I might have written as a 9-year old in 3rd grade. Ashanti's acting was absolutely terrible. Every theme and line of dialogue was trite, and we were so bored that my whole family actually agreed to turn it off not long before it was over. And we are huge Muppet fans."
1,Really really bad. Muppets turn X-Rated,"Ok, so that's a little bit of an exaggeration but not by much. How else would you classify the wonderful muppets when they turned from making hilarious jokes about the ""fork in the road"" (if you don't know that one, rent The Muppet Movie and see what the magic is all about) to Gonzo talking about his nipples or Kermit the frog hanging out with arms outstretched on a stick (he's the scarecrow) and announces, ""Hasn't anyone seen The Passion?"" Oh my gosh. Poor Jim Henson would be rolling over in his grave. There are also references to Girls Gone Wild and Kermit's sexual conquests. Such a dissapointment!"
1,Worst Muppet Movie Ever Made,"This movie made me mad. I love the muppets, two of my favorite movies EVER are the Muppets Christmas Carol and Muppet Treasure Island. The acting in this one was incredibly weak, the few songs that they had sounded like TV sound tracks, canned and lifeless. Many of the jokes and visuals were supposed to be funny for adults but went over the line for young kids (e.g. the female ""wizard"" with her big gazambas hanging out), and too mean or violent (the prolonged showing of a bloody buzz saw over Dorothy's legs). Even Kermit looked fake. If I could rate this in the minus range I would. I WANTED this to be good, I was excited to see it at the store, but other than a few good jokes from the prawn it was a huge disappointment. Shame on you, Disney."
1,The Muppets are better than this,"The Muppet Wizard of Oz has taken all of the elements of wit, style and clever insanity that have in the past made the Muppet show and movies to be timeless classics and completely disposed of them. The director, producers and writers left the selling point of the movie entirely up to classic caricatures of Kermit, Rizzo, Gonzo, and the rest of the Muppet cast to carry the story line along and all the while leaving out things like good storylines, or writing new materials in their humor. The only new humor that I detected at all was in cheap innuendo, not in wholesome family humor. I say all of this with the utmost respect, not to ridicule Jim Hensen studios, but as a big Muppet fan myself to encourage them on to greater masterpieces, and to play the Muppets out to the capacity that we all know and respect them for."
1,So very sad...,"I love (love, love, love) the Muppets, and checked this movie out from my library. I don't think I made it past 10 minutes- the point when Rizzo makes a comment about ""Girls Gone Wild"" movies. I'm an adult and was completely appalled. It's one thing to make a subtle joke in a kid's movie that adults can titter about, it's another to blatantly refer to an adult film production. How do you explain that to a curious child? I see from the other reviews now that the rest of the movie is garbage, and I'm glad I didn't continue watching (or buy it for that matter). What a shame that this movie wasn't done the way it should have been. I'll go watch the Muppet Christmas Carol and try to shake off the awfulness of what I just saw."
1,A Very Big Let-down,"I love the Muppets, and I love the Wizard of Oz. When this show was aired on ABC, I tuned in, and hated it from start to finish. I expected better. The muppets have always made wonderful remakes of stories, except this one. You will be seriously disappointed by Muppet Wizard of Oz."
2,Disappointing,"This movie made me sad. Although this is an official Jim Henson Company release, it seemed more like a cheap knock off of a Muppet movie. As if the idea behind this film was only to make money by using the Muppet name. The Muppets were just the supporting cast to the human actors. Lacks the cleverness and timing of the other films. Three year old children and people who are not tuned into the real art of Jim Henson and the Muppets will love it. Rent it don't buy it. Like buying a $25.00 Rolex from a city street vendor - It may look like a $4000.00 wristwatch, but it isn't the real thing."
3,Not great to me but my 4-year-old daughter loves it,"The Muppet's Wizard of Oz is not a great addition to the Muppet's collection. To me, it's just okay but my 4-year-old loves it. It lacks the adult intelligence that made the TV Muppet Show so special. The humor here is forced. However, as a show for a 4 year old girl it works. The real Wizard of Oz (1939) is too scary for her but this was her speed. There were a few jokes and images that I thought were a bit much for young kids (like the computer generated woman who looked like she was from a Teen rated video game) but I am a bit on the conservative side when it comes to my child. She's watched this several times (we recorded it off TV)and is one of the movies she wants to share with her playdates."
2,Picking the wrong target...,"Listen, I disliked this as much as the next person... but offensive due to content? Give me a break. The Muppets have never been as saccarine as Mickey Mouse. A degree of edgy humor is par for the course. Was it all funny? No, much of it was downright stupid. But offensive?If you're going to be offended be offended because of how lousy the entire thing was. Be offended by Ashanti's (lack of) acting. Be offended because of the mischaracterization and the tepid pacing. Be offended because it looked like it was shot on VHS tape. Be offended again by Ashanti's acting...Don't be offended because Gonzo has nipples. Deep in your heart you know you have them too."
5,Muppet collectors,"This is not the greatest muppet movie ever, but I considered it a crucial part of my collection. It had its moments."
4,Could have been better.,"My kids (Thomas, 6 years, and Saskia, 3 years) both enjoy this film. It gets repeated viewings. The variations to the original movie make it fun and interesting. Ashanti is a good choice as Dorothy (she has a great voice), and I loved the prawn as Toto. The CG for the Wizard are a bit weak, but the kids didn't seem to notice. My wife (not a muppet fan) thought the film was very B-grade. She would rate it 1 or 2 stars!Overall, in my opinion, a good family film, especially if you like the muppets."
2,"The curse of ""Muppet Treasure Island"" returns","As a major Muppet-head, I am disappointed to say that I will not be adding ""Muppet's Wizard of Oz"" to my collection (just as I never added ""Muppet Treasure Island""). Why? Because they're just not Muppet-worthy. Despite ""Wizard's"" few saving graces (Piggy in biker gear and eye-patch, Pepe's irresistible adult humor throughout) the movie fails to entertain and meet the Henson standard. Ashanti as Dorothy is lack-luster at best (and her choreography is embarrassingly bad). Many plot concepts at first seem clever but never quite gel. Worst of all, Fozzie sounds like Piggy!Put this one in your Netflix queue for some Pepe and Piggy laughs, but beware of spending $15plus on a copy to own."
1,Sooooo Disappointed!,"I love everything that has the Henson name stamped on it and I have loved the Wizard of Oz since I was a kid. So this was one of the biggest disappointments ever. Every part was the worst part! The acting was terrible, the storyline was really reaching, and the songs were not good AT ALL. My expectations were set very high but it was beyond bad, it was probably the worst movie I have ever seen."
1,1 star is waaaay too many!!!!!,"Can we just burn the source tapes and wipe the electronic media and pretend this did not happen? I for one don't understand the ""reach around"" that Disney seems to have purchased in so many online reviews that claim this piece of drek has ANY validity in the greater body of Henson's legacy. For shame that Pepe' would make such adult references (yes I realize that sounds hypocritical). The characters are only SUPPOSED to seem semi talented (Fozzie's jokes) while appealing to a more intelligent demographic. With the exception of the Wizard, the human cast IS only semi talented at best, and at worst should flee the country for fear of the muppet fan base finding them!!! In this ""Wiz"" production the creators have appealed to ONLY the lowest brow, mouth breathing, lowest common denominator that is responcible for the horrid state of air brained, mindless junk that transmits on our media screens these days..[...]"
1,Disappointed,"When I saw that another Muppets movie was coming out, I was very excited. I am always looking for good and wholesome family movies to watch with my daughter. I was very surprised after watching this movie. The humor was not appropriate for children (even if it was over their heads). I also didn't appreciate the sexual references (overflowing cleavage, etc.) It is often very difficult to find a children's movie that is appropriate for children. Unfortunately this movie does not deliver."
1,Muppets a Huge Disappointment,"The Muppet Wizard of Oz was a film that didn't have any magic to it whatsoever. It is highly inappropriate to have sexual references, even in regards to Gonzo's nipples, it is not appropriate for little kids to listen to this sort of garbage. What the hell is up with Brian Henson? Apparently Disney is just trying to follow with everyone else in this sex crazed world. There is no more creativity left and that is just wrong.In response to someone who left a comment saying that in the old variety shows of the 60's and 70's was there any references to nipples back then? I think not, and references of any kind back then was so hard for a little kid to figure out on their own, they were very much more hidden and more dryer. Nowadays it is just like sexual references are the only thing that is funny out there and it is just sick."
5,Great,"Some people might think this movie is corny, but it actally is good. Ashanti does a good job in this film. It's kinda weird, but you have to look pass that. I know I will be coping this dvd when it hits stores"
1,#1 Muppets Fan,"I'm the first person there would be to step up and defend the Muppets. I will not defend this movie. It is disgusting what has been done to this once great franchise. I was not dissapointed when I watched this movie when it first aired, I was angry. Jim Henson would never allow a movie this bad, this unimaginative, this unfunny to ever be made. The Muppets represented the greatest in all imagination. There in no imagination present in this steamer. Shame on you, Frank Oz, for participating in this film. You of all people should've known better. The Muppets mixed with the Wizard of Oz had so much potential but ended up being the worst Muppet project I've ever seen. Don't buy this movie. Don't buy this movie. Don't buy this movie. If you don't believe me, rent it first. When you do rent it rent something good that the Muppets did so you can wash that taste out of your mouth after you watch it."
1,I quit the human race,"This has got to be the absolute nadir of so-called ""family entertainment"". Hollywood these days, seems to be under the impression that children today want ""hip"", they want ""edgy"". Well I have news for these bozos; They want what they've always wanted; charming, witty and decent entertainment. If I sound a bit angry and annoyed over this P.O.S. I have a very good reason. This is not only unfunny, cheap and badly made, lacking any hint of the wit and charm of the Henson films, but it's vulgar to boot. Nipple pinching gags? There are so many things in this video that are unacceptable for small children that you might even find copies of this thing in the dumpster at a trailer park. Jim Henson and the Pixar people had the sensitivity and intelligence to realise you could entertain the parents of their intended audience with wit and charm. ""Hipness"" and sewer humor is a pretty pathetic substitute for quality."
1,A disgrace to the Muppet name. Pure garbage.,"Call me a prude if you will, but something very bad has happened in the Muppets creative department.I was really looking forward to watching this with my daughter but I found myself very tempted to turn it off and not finish it. I decided to finish it and hope she doesn't remember any of it.Dorothy has a 'tude as big as Kansas. There was so much inuendo it made me sick. This movie gives the Muppets a bad name.When my 7 year old daughter came home from school today she burped and I said ""ugh"" she replied, ""What do you smell it or something?"" I was appauled and told her never to repeat that rude comment again, only to find out later she was quoting a line from MUPPETS WIZARD OF OZ!!!There is no reason to tear apart the acting, the script was to blame for most of the trouble.I not only don't recommend watching it, I recommend avoiding exposing your children to it."
2,Disney finally gets it's hands on OZ and this is what they come up with?!?!,"Disappointment doesn't even begin to describe my reaction to the film. It all starts with the writing, obviously this was written by someone who knows little about the Muppets and their humor. There is absolutely no charm or class in this entire film. Ashanti is passible at best, the muppets have no real personality, the effects are an atrocious mix of bad lighting and ""Sesame Street"" like sets. It also would have been nice to have the music composed by someone who knew what they were doing. If you're going to make a musical, get someone who can do some catchy tunes. Bottom line, if you're an Oz fan or a Muppets fan...give it a once over, but no promises. Chances are, you won't be too happy."
3,It was OK,"We needed this to keep our Muppet collection up to date, but it was not exactly the strongest movie in the franchise. I did appreciate that they seem to have drawn more from the original book than the classic movie. As the Wicked Pig of the West is considering her options for gathering Our Heroes, she makes several references that will pass right by anybody who hasn't read the originals, and the original encounter with the Wizard is definitely in the style of the book (and folks who have only seen the movie are likely to be confused again)."
1,Muppets gone bad.,I didn't think the Muppets could be so dark! Glad we previewed this before showing it to little ones. Flying monkeys would have been welcomed. NOT for little tykes.
1,worst muppet movie ever.,"the main girl was no goodtoo modernized, almost like the people who made this movie know nothing about the muppets."
1,NOT kid friendly,"Of all the stupid things. I love the original muppets. We had a whole collection of the movies while I was growing up. IF you want a classic...you're looking in the wrong place. I'm a huge fan of the wizard of OZ as well...and this was so dumb.If you're wanting to buy this for your kids...DONT! They have horrible ""jokes"" that are no where NEAR approprate for kids. This was a disgrace to the muppets. If you want a good muppet show, go back and get muppet treasure island, Hey Cinderella, The Frog prince, or the muppet movie. Trust me...and the other thousands of reviews, it's not even worth it."
3,I love it but at the same time i hated it!,"Ashanti did great in this movie she is a very good singer!Nobody asked the mupphets to remake the wizard of oz.thatssort of why when the main part of dorthy going to oz is horriblegonzo is horrible as the tin man.its very confusing, getsboring and is kind of short."
5,Spacious with many compartments,"This bag must have been on sale when I purchased it, because I paid less for it. I thought it was a great deal for the money, because a lot of laptop bags are pricey. It has many different compartments included a place for an iPod. The laptop pouch will fit a 12"" iBook (or something comparable), and has padding on the side which aligns with the exterior of the bag. The interior side of the pouch is not padded. I have found that there is enough ""cushion"" in this bag. It's a great find!"
4,best in bite sized reads,"A big, bloated and immensely enjoyable volume of Lane's collected writings; mostly movie reviews and essays on pop culture. Eminently quotable - though not exactly the easiest volume to tote along to the beach. I especially enjoyed the essay on ""The Sound of Music,"" and the two on the bestsellers of today and yesteryear (I admire him for slogging through all those books that did not age gracefully and even more for admitting that he just could not get through several.) Unlike Ebert - who is a potato chip kind of movie critic easily absorbed but with no lasting nourishment - Lane's reviews often sound a deeper truth about how absurd the movie business - and society - is. It is especially fun to watch him taking aim at sacred cows and cherished pop icons alike. Ayn Rand, James Michener, Robin Williams, The Bridges of Madison County, and many more - watch out."
2,Poor Quality!,"Don't buy this! It is cheap. From the time I picked it up I knew it wasn't heavy enough to cook well, cook evenly. I ordered two, and wish I'd spent another ten dollars and gotten a quality skillet!"
5,Fantabulous,"If I could award this Video a 10 I would just for the musical score alone. Mario Lanza's talented rendition of the arias in this presentation make it one of his very best. This is a sure winner that will have you watching it over and over just for the music. Lanza's ""Pagliacci"" is spell-binding and his acting skill shines through in this touching tale. A must for your Lanza or Opera collection.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"
5,So Much in Love.,My favorite. I lost my original when I traded in my car. I think I accidentally threw it away. Love Ir!
5,~Pleasurable listening~,"This CD is a treasure. I play it for my Seniors and they love it. Easy listening, good music-they don't make 'em like that anymore. Thanks so much. Excellent price. And by the way? I love it too!!!"
4,Autumn Leaves worth price of album,"The Ray Conniff singers is definitely of a period. This particular album is one of the group's best, with less schmaltzy arrangements and creative group execution. Perfect for the Fall season."
4,L.A. in the 60's.....................,I've read several books by Eve Babitz and this one is my favorite. She capture's the atmosphere and the feeling of being a young person in L.A. during the 1960's.
3,Ignores non-Western church history,"This is an excellent guide to traditional Western church history, but it is a pity that it did not avoid implicitly consigning the rest of the world to either mission history or insignificance. This needs to be corrected."
2,Eccentric cam bolts,The product looks ok but did not do the job I needed so I installed them and then took them off the car. Did not give enough camber for my use.
2,lots of roads,"This is one in the ubiquitous Falconguide series, and it has the same virtues and vices of all of them. Virtues: good info on the region, OK maps, OK trail info, good energy. Vices: the author seems to think that mountain biking is done on dirt roads. Almost all of the rides are on roads, and there seems to be a concerted effort to not talk about popular single-track rides--most of the ST's listed are out-of-the-way oddities. If you want to ride classic single-track, this book is next to useless."
2,MIU Apple Cutter and Corer,"Good construction, but the cutting portion of cutter is blunt instead of sharpe. More like squashing than cutting/slicing cleanly. Definately not worth the money. Would not purchase again."
1,DANGER -- do not buy,"This product is very dangerous! It came apart while slicing an apple, with the ring in hand, and the blades embedded into the apple. I highly recommend anyone who is thinking of buying this slicer find another one instead."
1,"Badly made, suggest avoiding","We bought this after a long search for a 12 piece fruit slicer. When my wife went to use it, the entire thing fell apart halfway through the first pear. She was left with three pieces: the blades, the ring that holds the blades, and the outer handle assembly. Look for a different slicer."
1,not a good buy,I bought this with high hopes because I use alot of large apples and the reguler ones do not fit. I used it twice and it completely fell apart the second time.
2,"OK for apple pie slices, not so good for everyday use","I own both the OXY good grips version and took a chance on a couple of these at the Friday sale. The slice sizes and core area is much more petite than the oxy cuts out. Unless you cut a flat skinless surface on the top and bottom of the apple, you better plan on bearing down 40-50 pounds of weight onto theis corer to get the blades through an apple. It really is hard! (as others have noted)Mine hasn't rusted, but I do find myself reaching for the OXY cutter instead. My guess is that when I'm making apple pies and I want the thinner slices, these will come in handy... For general use, take a miss."
2,"Worked for a while, then fell apart","I bought this and it worked well for about 6 months, then fell apart. I use one nearly every day to cut up one apple. Most brands, even the one from Sur La Tab , start getting loose in the center then eventually fall apart. This one didn't last any longer than the others."
2,save your money,Used it for awhile but it broke slicing through an apple. Just go buy a lower cost one and it will work just as good as this one.
2,Bronze glow that rubs off,"L'Oreal Sublime Bronze tinted SelfTanning Lotion does not live up to its advertised hype. I have used the ""golden Natural Tan"" , however the Deep Natural Tan is not at all like the ""Golden"". I found the Deep Natural Tan formula streaks and also rubs off on clothes. When applied it takes a long time to dry and still feels tacky when dry. I will not use this product again altho it says ""New"" it is not a self-tanner I will use again."
4,Works well for me!,"I read the recent reviews and thought I'd put in my 2 cents. I like this a lot. I bought one tube in 2010 and used it during that summer and the next, once or twice a week, to keep the ""tan."" I just bought my 2nd bottle. Good value, I think, and it's a heck of a lot safer than the sun or a tanning bed. It looks very natural on me. My son, in his 20's, cares about his tan, and complimented me on mine. So he thought it was natural. It IS possible to miss spots, so you have to be careful. I figure no one is looking as critically as I am, so I can overlook a missed spot if it occurs. Nice color. Does rub off on clothing if you put clothes on right away, so...wait. You have to plan."
3,good tan but streaks a little,"Good color but once you have it on your hands you need to wash them immediately or you will have orange hands. Of course, when you do that the tanner comes off and your hands are white but your arms are tanned. Interesting look! Bottom line-get someone to put it on for you. Legs seem to look good. I think I will try one of those spritz tanning sessions. Always looking!"
5,Cool looking lightweight and has calendar too...,Great watch. Titanium is light and strong. Calendar is a nice add on feature and quite readable. Would recommend this watch.
2,Um... what?,"I'm a huge Agatha Christie fan and a psychology major, so I was given this book as a gift by someone who though I would enjoy it. Wrong! By the time I was done reading it the cover was torn and the binding broken from being hurled against the wall in frustration. First of all, I get it. Second of all, it's this kind of [stuff] that give psychology a bad name. This guy has nothing better to do that rethink one of the greatest mystery novels of all time?.."
1,Bayard doesn't have a clue,"The idea of a story entering the public domain and giving rise to a variety of interpretations and even, in the case of a mystery novel, to a new ending, is an interesting one. What a pity that Bayard lacks the analytical and writing skills to make a go of it. There is much wrong with this book, but I would like just to point out one glaring error. Bayard's 'solution' depends on Roger Ackroyd admitting the murderer through the french windows in his study. Unfortunately, there were no french windows in the study; they were in the drawing room. The study had sash windows. Although this invalidates Bayard's entire thesis, it is among the least of the problems with this book. The real mystery (more puzzling than anything Ms Christie could have dreamed up) is how this book got published in the first place."
4,very good,"bob has just his voice,guitar and harmonica on this one.its one his earlier albums.the first song is the best one as he fights the man .the second song""ballad of hollis brown"" us utterly depressing as a starving man kills his starving family and then himself.""with god on our side"" openly challeneges christianity.this was before,of course,he converted.""only a pawn in thier game"" sticks it to the man again.then a pretty love song comes by called ""boots of spanish leather"".then theres a few more songs here and there for filler.this is one of the early albums that got him his title as the voice of a generation.and after hearing it i would agree."
3,Dark Depressing Dylan,"This album looks and feels like a John Steinbeck novel. I get somewhat depressed just looking at the cover, and the effect increases when actually listening to the album. Dylan writes some solid folk/protest tunes here. It's nowhere near Freewheelin' but it's enjoyabie, although it's my least favorite folky Dylan album. Get this if you already have Freewheelin' and Another Side Of."
4,Pessimistic but great,"I really like Dylan's music, lyrics, how he plays the guitar and harmonica, he's a great artist. This is one of the first Dylan's records i bought and still one of my favorites. His not-so-good voice sounds perfect for this songs. Hear ""Only a pawn in their game"" and ""One too many mornings"" and enjoy."
3,Not Quite Up to Bob's usual level,"Not one of The Dude's best. I will admit that I prefer the ""rock"" bob, to the ""folk"" bob, but I if you want to sample his folk days get the more personal ""Another Side of Bob Dylan"" or ""Blowin in the Wind,"" and skip this one. It is very much an example of his protest stage, which is fine, but it just isn't nearly as good musically as a lot of his other work. There's nothing to sing along too, although some of the tracks are interesting to listen to soley to hear Bob's opinions on different issues, agree or disagree with him. ""Only A Pawn in Their Game"" is about how, in Bob's opinion, the rich Southern whites have and are using the poor Southern whites as tools against the blacks, even though racism doesn't profit the poor Southern whites, and the rich ones are the ones who benefit. ""Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll"" about poverty and violence is also good."
4,One of Dylan's darkest,"Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin' sternly rejected the romance and optimism of most popular albums of the sixties. On this disc, Dylan all but put aside his streaks of wittiness and tenderness and his knack for rallying the crowds (""When the Ship Comes In"" and the title anthem being exceptions) and focused his peerless song-writing skills on spiteful confrontation. Times is an album of bleak social commentary (""With God on Our Side,"" ""Only a Pawn in their Game""), accounts of romance gone bitter (""Boots of Spanish Leather,"" ""Restless Farewell"") and tragic story-songs (""The Ballad of Hollis Brown,"" ""The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carol""). The album, like its more varied predecessor, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, presents a catalogue of endlessly covered classics. Times surely continued to cement Dylan's place as the best songwriter of his generation, but, take as a whole, it can be one bitter pill to swallow."
2,production geared toward children or early teens,This is a juvenile level production geared toward children or early teens at best. It was not my cup of tea
2,whats the big deal?,"I'm not paying almost 30 dollars for a standard format DVD. I have this on VHS in standard and that does me fine until they release the DVD in widescreen. I can't believe people would pay that amount for something they can see on cable in standard format or buy the VHS at about half the price. Being deaf the extra features don't add anything because they are very, very rarely captioned."
3,liberal insight into the realm of human intent,"I get a little peeved when filmmakers make movies for the sake of art versus the need for company. For example, many readers read for company (great characters, intriguing plot) rather than for insight into the mind of a writer's sensous intellect. In the movie ""A Place in the Sun"" I thought this was very much the case. The film explores many things besides romance - such as the guilt of intent. The movie plot, execution, and acting are enough for the viewer to tolerate the movie in black and white yet the ending is something to be desired."
1,American Misery,"The movie A place In the Sun is a great example of a old movie thats based on old themes. The movie in black in white is not appealing, and I lossed interest because of it. Elizabeth Taylor plays a rich girl, while Montgomery Clifts plays the role as the poor lad who is drawn towards Taylor. The plot is simple, based on Clifts desire for Taylor and his desire to kill his current love for this passion. If this plot turns you on and you have a desire for black and white I suggest this movie,but if your from the new school as I am this movie is a bore."
1,"Oh dear me, no!",I thought this was the DVD of the popular channel 4 show. You can only imagine how disappointed I was when the lovely lady who presents the show failed to appear on my screen. Instead I had to sit through a boring old-fashioned film. I gave it a chance but didn't like it. Maybe it was just the disappointment affecting my judgment...
5,The Perfecto Stars For A Perfecto Movie!,This Film Has A Perfect Cast List. And This Is The First Film Out Of The Three Films That Liz Was Teamed Up With Monty (Raintree County And Suddenly LAst Summer Followed.)Shelley Winters Is Wonderful As The Girl Whom Monty Kills. Liz Is The Girl Whom Monty Falls For And She Falls Right Back For Him. Anne Revere Is Good As Monty's Mother. All In All This Film Is Perfecto With A Perfecto Cast To Help It!!
3,A bit much,"Montgomery Clift gives a very good performance as do Taylor and Winters but nothing can change the fact that this film drags just the tiniest bit. Raymond Burr shows up in a role that he works wonders with.The tension in some scenes is palpable as the orchestra brings in a soft low murmer of music. The best scene of the whole movie is when Clift stands listening to the radio and the announcer comes on to plant the idea in his head. Not to give anything away, but the closing scenes are also powerfully moving.Not the best movie I've every seen, but worth a watch."
4,GRIPPING!,"I've never been a fan of either Elizabeth Taylor or Montgomery Clift - not to mention Shelley Winters! However, this screenplay is so gripping that all that meant nothing. The story of star-crossed lovers is as old as Romeo & Juliet. But this movie makes it all brand new once more.I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys true suspense at its finest."
3,a place in the sun,i would not share this with any body else on that movie watch it again i did not like to much.
3,Daring But Miscast,"Elizabeth Taylor did her best to sell a new romance with such little dialogue. But Montgomery Clift was trying too hard to look intense and tortured. There isn't enough in the script to convey his ambition and desperation. Shelley Winters also overdid the plain girl throwing tantrums to keep her man act. All that being said, there is some great cinematography and astute observations of rigid class barriers."
4,unforgetable,"In the 1951 film released by Paramount Studio Director George Stevens lets a story of how a young mans desires ruin him. George Eastman played by Montgomery Clift; his uncle, with really only one rule, gives the poor nephew of a rich business owner a job. You cannot date co-workers. He meets young women named Alice played by Shelly Winters and falls in love. Will a few months later he meets Angela Vicher a rich socialite and they fall in love. He is caught between the two women. And his life and there's never the same again. This movie shows us that we need to be careful for what we wish for, we may actually get it, and it may not be that good. This movie is for those you like to see the underdog lose."
5,Classic Montgomery,"Although this film was around two decades before my birth, it's definately one of my favorite movies of all time. I love any movie with Montgomery Clift who is mesmerizing as he reads his lines. In this case, matching Monty with Liz was a brilliant plan by the directors. These two stars are excellent as the two main characters who fall in love. Monty, the poor boy who was raised in a homeless shelter ran by his mother. Liz, the rich socialite from a well-to-do family. As Monty tries to fit in, a pregnant girlfriend may ruin his chances with Liz so he briefly thinks about drowning the girlfriend but changes his mind. Without spoiling the movie, this classic tale is suspenseful as we see Montgomery's life torn apart. If you like old movies or just a good, suspenseful story, rent this!! A good Sunday afternoon movie."
