2,Made very cheap,"When I received the package, almost every plastic part was broken. It wasn't packaged very well. It just laid in a bag in the box with no support to stop it from moving during shipment. Some parts of the metal were even bent. I wear a size 8.5 (womens) and the foot pedals are still too big for my feet. Everything started squeaking about a half hour into exercising. However, despite everything being broken, I fixed what I could and it still works and does its job. The only part I don't like is you have to unscrew part of the arms in order to properly fold them for storage. It's also 40 pounds...that's quite a heavy machine to be folding/unfolding and moving around every day."
3,Its good for the money-not great!,"I'm a woman thats 5'5, 125 lbs, I found it easy to put together, One thing I didnt like is that there are no exercise instructions at all-nothing. I found some rowing vids on youtube. I didnt have a problem with the pedals but they could have been made better. The rowing bars are not even, though I put it together right.The machine squeaks LOUD. Solution I put clear plastic packing tape all around the inside and now its so quiet.My back hurts after I'm donw rowing. And the calorie count says I only burned 13 calories for 20 minutes of steady rowing.Maybe I'm doing something wrong but im not too happy with this machine."
4,Stamina Body Trac Rowing Machine,Rower came unassembled. Assembly instructions were excellent. All necessary tools came in the package. Rower is sturdy and easy to use. It is an excellent value for the price. I would recommend it to anyone.
1,Terrible,I got the machine and it was bent. I bent it back out with pliers so that I could put it together. It was missing a screw and the cord to the monitor was ripped in half. I emailed the company and no response. One of the worst purchases I've ever made.
4,Nice option for beginner.,"Not bad to work up it, very little strength is required to row it, nice option for beginner, can use it to warm up"
2,Boring,"Very disappointed. You really have to be a Seal Fan to take this on. The show is just Seal and the boys in the background. There was no change of set, clothing or anything. Just him on an empty stage with the band. Sade could teach him a thing or two."
5,By far the best concert DVD I've seen.,"Well, I've seen many concert DVD's and most of the time I was dissapointed, sometimes by a picture quality but mostly by sound. But this one! This is just the best DVD you can ever buy! Until recently, I adored these two - The Cure - Trilogy and David Gray - Live At the Point. But Seal just sets a standard for all the others. The picture is perfect and the sound, guys, this just sounds awesome! No speakers on the stage, all the musicians wear Ultimate Ears custom headphones ($900) and it obviously works great! Not a single mistake, everything is so clear and Seal is just one of the best singers. How this guy can sing, that's unbelievable!Go ahead and buy, worth every penny! And go for the set with a CD - you'll find yourself listening to this concert CD instead of his other ones.Absolutely LOVE IT!"
5,A Lasting Love!!,This book is the best! I love the way Rina and Cleveland finally get together. You have to get this book.
1,Absolutely terrible,"This dvd is peppered with extracts from the ""Storytellers"" performance. It's pretty much a rehash of Storytellers but it doesn't flow. There are continuous interruptions with ridiculous comments from the reviewers. For example, the review about ""When September Ends"". The reviewer claims that people mistakenly think that the song is about September 11. On Storytellers, Billie Joe himself says he's never written a song about his father (though there is mention of him in the song). Someone at a concert heard Billie Joe dedicate it to a friend of his that died in the September 11 attacks. Add in ridiculous commentary about the chords in the songs. I can't see anything good about this dvd. I'd rather watch the Storytellers performances again. Thank goodness Green Day didn't endorse this load of..."
2,"Big Green Day Fan, but don't waste your time","Disappointed in this. I am giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because atleast it was Green Day, and I love the band. I don't know who's idea this was!"
2,cheap looking,"I wish it was smaller and looked better in person than it does. For the money, it looks gaudy and cheap. I have not worn it once. Maybe I will give it another try, but meh...wish I had returned it..This is the fourth clip I have purchased from Amazon I LOVE the others), but the first of this kind. Shame."
3,Beware of the hardware version,"This is an awesome calculator. It does everything I need to do and more. However, since I purchased this in 2012 I figured I would get the latest hardware version. Unfortunately, I received hardware version 3. Hardware version 4, the latest, was released in 2006. Why is this older version still being shipped six years later? If I would've known that when I opened the package I would've sent it right back to Amazon."
5,The extra $$ is worth it.,"I have used many calculators in the past, but the TI-89 Titanium is the best ever. The words are not hard to read at all, as some would believe, and the symbolic manipulations are just like magic. As a student who is stepping into Algebra 2, and preparing to finish up AP Calculus BC, Calculus III, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, and AP statistics, everyone else who has been in my situation has bought a TI-89, or a similar calculator with CAS. This calculator is well worth the $20 more than the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition, since interchangeble faceplates don't really appeal to me, and I really need some symbolic manipulation features to help me during Algebra II and all the other courses."
4,Like having a Mac CPU in your pocket with a PC user interface,"The learning curve is steeper, but worth it if you need the features. My teenage daughter rejected this calculator in favor of a TI-83, even after a year. The math textbook we use has TI-83 keystrokes on the page, which don't transfer to the TI-89.The 32-bit 68000 processor in this TI calculator blows the weaker 8-bit Z-80 CPU equivalent in those lesser models away. You can do so much more with this calculator, including emulating it's weaker cousin, the TI-83."
5,Excelent Product,"I have been working with the calculator for almost three weeks now. Its easy to use (compared to other graphing calculators such as the hp), and has many useful functions. Its ideal for al the calculus courses in engineering."
5,It works!,"Great calculator. May be a little much if you're not ""dabbling"" in derivatives. This thing is like a palm pilot on steroids."
5,TI-89,great calculator for scientific math. if only i knew the ins and outs of this machine. it has so many functions it's crazy.
5,great calculator,"very helpful, can do some amazing calculations and stuff. very helpful for engineering in particular. highly recommended"
2,Does NOT support Mac OS 10.5 and up!!!,"If you only use Mac OS, do NOT buy this calc if you plan to update the calc or upload new programs. It does NOT work and Ti has failed to support the last 2 versions of OS X."
5,how can it be any better?,"alright. people have been complaining about the blue lettering that makes it hard to make out on the black background.. i did not find that as a problem at all.. i mean unless youre forced to calculate stuff under dim lighting, its really not that bad.. secondly, someone said something about contrast.. that its hard to see at an angle.. i looked at mine ata 45 degree angle and i perfectly saw everything on the screen.. the only discomfort i had was that i was used to the buttons on ti-83 that i always get confused where the square root button is located on the 89..besides that, there arent any problems for me.. now i dont have to work out integrals..! oh boy.. haha"
3,horribe packaging~,Extremely sharp plastic which is almost impossible to cut open. I have not used it yet.
4,Just a few things... (updated review),"The things preventing me from giving this a 5 is these:- The text in display is too small, I would like it as big is on the ti-83 calc.- When you turn it on, the screen doesnt pop up immidiantely, it takes ~2 sek, leaving an unsatisfied feeling.- The cover is opened in the wrong direction, its more imortant to protect the screen side than the button side.Otherwise, it is a good flashy little toy that makes all the regular ti83 owners go: ""Oh, cool, what is that?"" =)"
4,Decent calculator,"Great calculator, the price is somewhat of a setback though. If you're doing math in college this is definitely recommended."
4,Just what I need.,"Calculator came in it's original packing with the cables, but without the cover. The buttons were stuck at one point as if something spilled on the calculator. If you keep pressing them eventually they will go back to normal. Other then that it works perfect, item as described, received a day earlier which is great. Four stars due to not having the cover."
3,Great for finance/statistics/math. Not good for engineering,"I purchased this to replace my HP48SX and 49GX. It was a mistake. The HP has many built in equations/conversions/periodic table that I relied on. The TI calculator IS great for statistics/math but the lack of just some basic engineering conversions has been really irritating.Plus, TI loaded this thing with useless features--calendar, notepad, planner, tasks, as if they were trying to make it a mini PDA. I have a PDA, what I need is a good scientific calculator."
4,Texas Instruments TI-89,This calculator is awesome for the fact that it will do way more than most people will ever need. Only downside is that its really hard to figure it all out without some sort of teacher.
5,TI-89 Titanium Review,This calculator is great for doing almost anything! Supports everything have had to do in my college calculus classes and Electrical Engineering courses. The only complaint is there are so many functions it has taken me a long time to figure out how to use everything and the instruction manual is nice but not extremely helpful.
3,Still confess,"Ive had this for awhile now and I still have no idea how to use it, so i just went back to my old TI-83 Plus"
2,Incredible difficult to read,"Has some impressive capabilities, but is pretty much worthless if your eyesight is less then perfect. Not a lot less than perfect, just slightly off 20/20 is a problem. If you don't absolutely need this calculator, get something that you can see. I got mine as a gift. If I had a receipt, I'd return it today. Guess I'll see if banging my old HP on the table fixes it."
4,"Very good, but not for basic classes.","I was forced to buy this calculator for an Introduction to Calculus class, and I'm generally very pleased. It does everything I wished my TI-84 did, and more. For example, it will integrate, differentiate, zero functions, and display fractions and radicals automatically. The clock is nice too.Strangely, it takes a significant longer time to graph. Timing it, my TI-84 will graph y=x in around 1 second. The TI-89 takes around 4, and takes even longer to graph more complicated functions.I also takes a lot of button pushing to accomplish basic tasks. To find the sin(.75) it takes me 9 buttons versus 6 on my old calculator. Doesn't seem like a lot, but since I'm only doing basic tasks the calculator wastes more of my time than it saves.Overall, it's a really nice calculator, but don't buy it if your not going to utilize it correctly."
4,Calculus Useage - High School,"Overall, this is a pretty good calculator. However, it should be noted that it does take some time getting used to, especially when switching from a TI-83. The graphs are exceptional and there are many new options. Actually the amount of things it can do is both exhilerating and frustrating at the same time. One negative point is that when you enter in a simple calculation, like 734/87, it will NOT give you the decimal answer and will just leave it in fraction form. I hate that. Therefore, simple calculations are no longer simple on here."
4,Ti-89,"Dude this is the best Calculator available! It is the top of the line. I also have the HP50g and I would highly reccommend the ti-89. Also on a side note if you get the ti-89 i also loaded an app onto it called ""Calculus Made Easy"" that does step by step soultions to most calc 1,2 and 3 problems. It was great along with my ti89 for working homework problems and filling in the blacks that I missed during lectures and reading."
4,Great Calculator,Bought for my daughter taking AP Calculus - was the one required by the course and really make the function graphing easy. I wish this stuff was around when I was getting my engineering degree.
2,Fair Calculator,"OK, I bought this calculator without trying it out first. I've been a TI-83 user for years and love the TI-83. First, what I don't like about the TI-89. The screen is too small for what it tries to do. The viewing angle is critical. Because so much is crammed on a small screen, given the critical viewing angle, this baby is tough to read. Numerics are much smaller than the TI-83.Yes, its powerful, with many functions the average person will never need. Like Boolean expressions. If you're a logic designer this may be useful, but you shouldn't need a calculator for that. And finance? Why not concentrate on the scientific market?I would prefer a brighter display with larger numerals. Therefore, I rate it 2 stars."
1,battery vampire,"Be sure when you buy this battery-guzzling piece of junk that you also invest in a rechargeable battery kit as well. This thing sucks the batteries EVEN WHEN IT'S TOTALLY OFF! If you don't use it for a month, your batteries will be completely dead. You'll need four AAA's.Hey, guys at TI: can you effin' fix this, please? Or are you a subsidiary of Energizer, Inc.?"
1,I should have known...,When all of those excellent reviews are years old. Try getting a device driver for Windows 7 64 bit and you are flat out of luck. Not only that but TI's web site hasn't even figured out that Windows is now into Version 7. I am super disappointed in the backwardness of TI. What a disappointment.
3,A good calculator,"The calculator is in good condition.But it does not come with manual which is a drawback. There are some scratches, kind of bad for a refurbished product. So it's not a usual refurbished item, I guess."
4,WARNING -- But this model is not allowed in some schools,WARNING -- But this model is not allowed in the schools (IT-84 and below are OK).
5,One word: The best calculator ever...,"This calculator is incredible. I'm starting a fan club. it solves equations, graphs in 3D (and 4D) IS ALLOWED ON THE SAT I & II, will do your dishes and can connect to your computer for updates and other cool things. REALLLLY HELPFUL FOR THE SAT (Most powerful calculator allowed)."
4,Powerful calculator,"The TI 89 is a very powerful graphing calculator. It has a built in polynomial solver, matrix solver, note program, and many other applications. The only problem with it is its connectivity. I am running a 64 bit Vista and cannot use the software to connect the calculator to my computer. Texas instruments has said that it is not compatible with my system. Other than that, its a great calculator. Amazon also has the best price!"
5,Great Calculator,"Great for advanced math, physics, and chemistry. Tons of ram, plenty of data storage, and excellent cpu (as far as calcs go.)Also, if you find anything you can't do with the functions and flash apps available from the ti website, download a 3rd-party application. The best place for these is ticalc.org.There are a plethora of third-party addons including:games (both 2d and 3d)a gameboy emulator (called gb68k)an ebook reader and about a hundred converted public domain etexts from project gutenberga chess game whose a.i. will beat you unless you're really good.plenty of third-party math and science addons are also available."
4,"Pretty nifty, but also a bit confusing","I've been using a TI-83+ for the past six years, and when the display stopped working, I decided to upgrade. I haven't used that many different kinds of calculators in my life, so I can't make comparisons between this one and its competitors. My main impressions up to now are that it's almost like a PDA with some of the functions it has, like the to-do list and the clock, so it was confusing to navigate the first time I turned it on. It took me over a minute to figure out how to get to the normal calculator screen. I'm not quite done with the learning curve, given that I'm still not sure how to use/do a number of things (and I'm certainly not using it to its full potential), but I don't think that learning curve is much worse than the TI-83+'s, and I fully expect this calculator to last just as long. The price tag did make me wince, but it IS an investment after all, like a computer or a car."
5,Beautiful and powerful...,Bought it for Circuits course and used it to solve system of equations with real and complex numbers. Really useful to convert from polar to complex imaginary numbers.
3,TI-89,Be careful shopping for the TI-89! There are several different versions of the same model. Make sure that the USB cable comes with the calculator so you can connect to the computer and update etc. The cable will cost you another twenty dollars seperatley.
4,Ti-89 vs. Ti-89 Titanium,"i`m a physics and engineering student and I've used both, ti89 and ti89 titanium several years and i still prefeer my ti89. Titanium is heavier and the feel and touch of the buttons is far better in the ti89. The only difference between both is the disk space available, software and display are exactly the same and unless you think you are going to have all the programs and notes of your entire carrier you dont need all the disk space in the titanium, i`ve never had space problems with the ti89 and i have all the programs i need uploaded."
4,A Convert,"After years of appreciating the well designed TI-83, I was sorry to sell mine and buy a TI-89 for calculus. After turning on the TI-89 Titanium I was even more sorry: it was very complicated at first, the learning curve is very steep.Once you spend some time with this calculator and discover how powerful it is, you start to appreciate how much it can do. This is a remarkable machine, and once you get comfortable with the interface (which is pretty cool once you get used to it) the TI-89 becomes an indispensable tool. A remarkable machine, with vast capabilities.I've also enjoyed the interface with myApple iMac G5 Desktop with 17"" M9843LL/A (1.8 GHz PowerPC G5, 512 MB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive). The software works perfectly, and makes working with this calculator very pleasant.If, when I was still in high school, someone told me I would ever have something this powerful in the palm of my hand, I could never have believed them. Worth the price."
5,Good,This calculator arrived on time and in really good conditions.the purchase came as it said on the prescription. I can trust on the system now :).
5,Great seller and calculator.,"Ordered this item on May 1st, paid the $10 for express shipping, amazone expected my item to arrive the 11th but it arrived today, the 4th. A++ for great shipping.Im currently used to using an HP39GS and I thought it was fairly difficult to learn, the Ti-89 is IMHO harder to learn BUT just after playing with it for a few hours I am able to quickly input things into the calculator a lot easier and faster than I could with my HP. It will take a while and may be impossible to effectively learn how to use ALL of its many functions but I will learn them as I need to use them.Oh and I love the split screen function especially while graphing."
5,Super Shipping!,"I ordered this calculator on Friday and received it on Monday, yet I only paid for 3-5 day shipping. That was amazing, it really came in handy on my Optics exam the following Wednesday. Just more quality service from Amazon. Thanks, guys. - J.C."
1,Worst Seller ever.,"I received this calculator after waiting an eternity to find out that the calculator is eroded with acid from use of old batteries. The calculator would not work no matter how many different batteries I used. Because the ""seller"" claimed the calculator worked he did not reimburse me the shipping. Never will I buy from this seller I dont suggest you do either."
1,Complete Crap,"Product lasted exactly one month and one day from purchase before dying completely (so Amazon won't take a return). And yes, I've tried every method of un-bricking it (new batteries, new button cell, turn up brightness, 3 finger reset, etc). If I could give it zero stars, I would. Stay as far away from this shoddy piece or work as you can."
1,"Bad Key Input Design (sin, cos, tan)","Very bad keyboard design, because is not like the ti-83, where you can press once to calculate sine, cosine, or tangent. On this calculator, they replace those three MAIN buttons for y,z,t. As a result if someone wants to calculate or graph sin (x), he must press the key ""2nd"" ""Y"", ridiculous pain in the neck.But graphing, taking the derivatives, and integrating is way much faster than the TI Voyage 200. Also it has better documentation, the rest is the same operating system."
1,:/,My TI89 came defected. The software on the device seems to be corrupted. I want a new one to be sent to me. How do I resolve this problem? I'll be highly upset if I'm stuck with this damaged one.
4,TI-89 takes time to learn to use,"My son has a TI-84 but the TI-89 is so different he was not able to show me how to use it. I am sure this is a great graphing calculator, but I do not recommend trying to learn how to use it while taking a caculus class at the same time unless you know someone who can show you how to use it. I plan to learn how to use the TI-89 before I start calculus II."
4,is good,cool features included. nice. but i still have a lot to learn about it when graphing and storing informations.
5,Good shower head for the price.,Shopped around locally for a good shower head under $30 and could only find good ones at $50 + with the same features as this one.Easy to install and works great and looks solidly made so far.
5,Good product,"I recently purchased a Culligan WSH-C125 Wall-MountFiltered Showerhead. So far, I have been very pleased with it.It was very easy to install, the showerhead has several spray options, and it seems to be doing a good job of filtering the water."
5,very nice,"I'd say it's every bit as good as the larger more expensive product this replaced. Without a filter, the water where I live is less than palatable and I feel less than clean after a shower. I would get out of the shower and use astringent on a cotton ball and turn the cotton ball brown! With the filter on, I can do the same thing and have a clean cotton ball and the water doesn't smell like a baitshop... proof enough for me!"
1,Narrow stream & low pressure,"I bought two of these due to the positive reviews. I should have paid more attention to the negatives because we found all of those to be true. No one in our family liked them due to the narrow spray and low pressure. Even on the widest selection (which was still too narrow) the spray of water had a dead space in the center and the pressure was not there. If you try to pivot the the showerhead, it only goes down and does not stay in any other position. It is difficult to change the selection when you are in the shower, plus the spray area only got smaller. We have a water softner and I was hoping this would be even better for our hair & skin, but saw no difference at all. Even my 11 yr old son wanted the old showerhead back on. Needless to say, I returned these and went back to our good old showerheads."
4,Good shower filter,"It seems a little cheap in materials, but I guess it will do the trick. I still have not figured out how to adjust the spray since the whole thing seems to turn. I admit I gave up easily since I did not care about the other streams. I actually do feel a difference after using this shower head."
2,Not a Good Product,"When this arrived it was pretty easy to install. However, I realized right away the ability to change the spray setting was broken. Despite that, the pressure was an improvement over my prior one so I kept it. About 4 months in I had the problem I've read in other reviews where it wouldn't stay up anymore, it just lays down and sprays straight down. Plus the plastic ring inside broke and it started squirting all over. Customer service acts like they'll send a replacement if I show them my receipt, but I'm not really sure I want to give this product another try anyway."
2,Water Spots on Glass Shower Door,There are still water spots forming on my glass door and the water pressure is not too good. My original shower head was much stronger.
5,Great shower head,"I tried to shop locally for a shower head but couldn't find one that was just the head, not detachable, and that was under $30. This shower head is perfect, bought 2 and am very happy with the quality."
2,poor installation directions,"granted i'm not the most handy person (so take this with a grain of salt), but when putting the filter in the showerhead, i thought for sure i needed to remove what appeared to be stickers on the filter... they didn't exactly come off easily, so i figured it must be part of the filtering process.but, no where did it say to remove these, not in the directions nor on the filter itself. needless to say, despite how hard it is to remove these stickers, you definitely need to remove them."
3,Just okay durable,It's a shower head like most shower heads will allow for greater coverage area than no shower head at all.
2,Just not doing the job,"I have had a couple different water filters, and I had to find one that was self-contained and wouldn't break off (to suit my husband, who kept breaking them). After using this filter for about a month, my hair and skin are drier than ever, hair is unmanageable, and zits are popping up on my face again. I'm on the lookout for a different one immediately."
1,Shower Head Filter,"Ordered 2 units, installed one and tested for 3 weeks. Did not experience much difference that previously without unit. Skin still felt very dry after showers. Will be looking at the units with better ratings."
3,Not a very fulfilling shower,"The filter itself works pretty well. There was a noticeable difference in my hair. However, the water pressure on this filter is horrible. I would get better pressure if someone peed on my head!"
2,Does nothing for hard water,"The product description says the filter removes ""scale"". I took that to mean the minerals in hard water. But I confirmed by using test strips that the shower head does absolutely nothing for hard water. Does anyone know a shower head that does?"
4,removes chlorine,"Shower filters are great to remove the nasty chlorine smell when you shower. They are a good idea because breathing chlorine into your lungs every time you shower is bad for you. Also, someone told me they got more mold in their bathroom once the chlorine was gone from the water, but I haven't found this to be true. All around I'm really glad I got a shower filter. As for softening hard water though, shower filters don't do that! Hard water is very hard on your skin and hair, but a shower filter won't make any difference in terms of the water's hardness."
4,"Great water quality, but reduced flow","Why I would believe another reviewer that the water pressure from this filter would actually go up compared to before is beyond me, but of course I didn't buy it for that reason. The water that comes out smells and feels clean and I wish I had bought this much earlier. For the price you probably won't be able to get a better deal. I once looked at showerheads costing twice as much and was hesitant, so I am glad I waited until I found this. Your skin will thank you."
2,Least effective shower filter,"This shower filter leaves my hair more dry and snarly like. I see there are high reviews for this filter but I disagree. Maybe the reviewers are not familiar with a lot of different brands as I have been forced to do-- I live in a hard water area and I also have naturally dry and very coarse hair- a lethal combination. So, I have experimented with several different filters and the best brands I have used are Sprite, Paragon and Aquasana. So, maybe this filter reacts differently depending on your water quality and type but I did not like it."
5,I like showering now!,"Not that I didn't use to.But I recently moved to a town that has super hard water which made me dread taking showers. I've only been living here for about 5 weeks, but within that time my hair has started to get really dry, my scalp has become extremely itchy and flaky, along with my skin. I decided that there was something that I had to do about it so I ordered this product.Oh my lord. This product is a life-saver. My skin feels noticeably more hydrated after showers and my hair is slowly starting to get back that old luster I once had about 5 weeks ago. Unfortunately, I haven't had this long enough to comment on the longevity of the filter, but I will update the review after I start seeing a decline in filtration quality."
3,Was not as amazing as I hoped,"After reading reviews for many shower heads, this seemed like the best choice. I had just moved, and replaced the old shower head with a new one that wasn't any better, so I really wanted this one to work out. Before reading shower head reviews, I hadn't realized that I could filter my shower water... and I happened to have a skin rash that the dermatologist couldn't figure out... so I figured I'd give it a try. At first it seemed like it helped the skin rash, but then the rash came back, so I don't think the new water had anything to do with my rash (probably just came from the stress of moving). I still like the idea of filtered shower water (since all the water I drink is filtered). What is disappointing to me with this shower head is that none of the sprays are as powerful as I would like. So overall it's fine, but I probably don't need a filtered shower so I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Awesome is the word,"I really like this product. It has five nice water settings, the one I really like is the water does not come with pressure on your scalp and gives a bubbly water feel"
4,"Very Good, But Not Great","We have very bad water in our house. The house is over 60 years old with galvanized pipes. Between rust and hard water it's very hard on showerheads. It doesn't take long in our house to completely plug up a showerhead. And yes, you can use vinegar to remove the hard water, but it never works quite right.This filtered showerhead has solved all of that! We've been using it for 3 months and have as much water pressure as we started with. No hard water stains on the head. I can't say I've noticed a big difference in my hair, but my skin is not quite as dried out as usual.The only con I have with it is that it doesn't produce a very wide spray. If it did, it would be absolutely perfect!"
3,OK,"cheap material, but works fine. I thought this looked better than the actual product. The material way plastic like and not full metal. However, so far it has worked fine."
2,Nothing special,"We have really, really hard water at my house. I will not even take my medications with water straight out of the tap. Everything is filtered. I stumbled across this product and thought how wonderful it would be to take a shower in filtered water. No more calcium and who knows what else in my hair or on my skin.It was pretty easy to mount since I read the reviews and saw how to prevent the leaking. But, honestly, I cannot tell any difference in the water. I filled a glass with the water coming directly from the shower head and it tasted just like the water straight out of my tap. I would not recommend this to anyone for anything other than just a plain 'ol shower head."
2,I don't think the filter does anything,"It is bulky and the sole reason why i bought it was for the filtering. I have not noticed any difference, and the pressure is much lower than before"
2,When it rains it pours.... Unless its a Culligan,"This shower head worked miracles for the water while it lasted. Albeit, only lasting a couple weeks. If only they could figure out the longevity issue, this shower head would be top notch."
3,Just OK for a cheap shower head,"I purchased 2 of these showerheads about a year ago. For the price they are OK. However, unless you really have water issues I don't know that you will really notice a difference in water quality. Additionally, one of them drips almost constantly. I even purchased a new filter to see if that would rememdy the problem. Unfortunately, it did not."
3,"Good filter, not a great shower head","As many of the reviews for this product indicate, the unit does seem to do a very good job of filtering the water supply and removing the chlorine odor. Just be aware of the head design. See all those little nozzles? They point straight out (no flare) and the front of the shower head is flat. As a result, the shower stream is EXTREMELY narrow.Measured 18-20"" from the shower head, the water cone is barely the width of a dollar bill. That's a tight spread and your shoulders are out of the water if the shower is aimed at the middle of your back. There is no adjustment to widen the water spray. This may not bother everyone. However, if you like a wide spray, buy an inline filter and use the shower head of your choice.I wish I had understood just how narrow the water stream was before I purchased this unit. This is my only complaint about an otherwise quality unit."
5,I love it!,Big difference in my skin....Highly recommended. Might I add that the different settings are a major plus! Soft and smooth skin and hair...It's definitely worth it!
5,SOFT SKIN and SILKY HAIR!,"I am 100% in love with this showerhead. I've been using it since I received it - prompt shipping - and what a big different it has made. My skin is baby soft, my hair is silkier and I haven't changed shampoos or bodywash at all. The water pressure is perfect, the different settings are great and the price for all this was well worth the small amount! You definitely get more than you bargain for with this. I highly recommend this item."
2,Knob for spray settings doesn't turn,The shower head was easy to install but the grey knob to adjust the shower settings does not turn when the water is on. It turns fine when the water is off but of course that doesn't help much. :-) The shower settings were just a bonus but I feel like the product is defective and I didn't entirely get what I paid for. Would try another product if the shower settings are important to you.
5,Great for Low-Pressure Showers (and old pipes),"My new apartment had pretty lousy water pressure and one of those generically bad shower heads. The water made all of my roommates' skin dry out, and we all had greasy looking hair and dandruff.Immediately after putting this on (which was much easier than I thought it would be), the water pressure improved dramatically - shortening needed shower times as well. After 2 days, all of our skin and hair was looking better. Definitely a great quality-of-life purchase.I'd highly recommend this for anyone with bad water pressure, dry skin, or bad hair. Your water could be the cause."
3,descent.,"No frills showerhead... Next time I will get an inline, and use my own shower head when this one is dead. But filter works good even with hot water."
4,Great Water!,"Everything I expected -- good smelling water, no dry skin after a shower and fuller hair. A GOOD buy!"
5,"Seems really good, but no wrench","Only had it a day, but hair is completely different than normal. WAY less dry and just feels different. It feels like the water is softer. It said it comes with a wrench, but doesn't. Im not going to give it less stars though because it is cheapest shower filter I could find that filters out 99%+ of chlorine, so whatever. I bought a strap wrench froms sears for 5 bucks that works awesome. so far so good. just wanted to let people know about the lack there of a wrench. If you can't afford reverse osmosis or live in an apartment like me, give it a try."
4,culligan filtered shower head,The Water is softer and the water deposits are not as bad as my unfiltered water so a little easier to clean. I am not sure my skin is less dry but I am still hoping for the filtered water to help my skin.
5,Best I've Used,"This filter is the best filter I have used. before I bought this, I was hoping to find a shower filter that would help with the water pressure here, and boy, I made a great decision with this one."
3,"Good, but...","I definitely noticed a difference in the quality of the water (i'm dark-skinned and the shower water left white deposits on my skin), but i can tell that not everything is filtered out because i still see some deposits on my skin after a shower with the Culligan. Otherwise, i do like the different shower settings and it is definitely an upgrade from our last shower head."
4,Decent build,"Took only 10 minutes to install, but water leaks and drips from the front tightener... Took another 30 minutes to fix that leak using teflon tape and other things. Still leaks every now and then.."
4,Build-up and softer water,I have city water and I noticed my hair does not get the build up on it like it use to. The water also seems much softer.
2,Ok,Have only noticed a mild difference in the quality of water since changing my shower head to this one sadly.
3,"Defective, but filter seems great.","I received this item quickly and it was well packaged. The filter seems to be one of the best that I've seen. I used it only once and could tell a difference in hair texture and reduced skin itch. The water is very harsh where I live. There was, however, some problem with the unit I received. I could not get a decent amount of pressure from the spray head. On some settings, it was little more than a trickle. I tried removing the seal and/or reversing the seal with no success. Product must be damaged internally in a way that it is obstructing the flow. Because of the success of the filtration during my one shower, I can't rate the item poorly. I think it has a good filter and I just received a defective unit."
4,Good product,Good product for good price. I can feel the difference when using the water. I'd recommend this product to someone else.
2,Nice economical design but could not notice a difference.,Maybe its doing something but I couldn't tell the difference. Tried a different one from Home Depot at my last place and could definately tell the difference. Not sure I can recommend.
4,Easy to install,It does the job well. Now I have clear water coming out from my shower head. Totally happy about it!
5,Great buy !!,"This one is really good. It does a good job of removing the chlorine and filtering the water. Comes with 5 different settings for the shower which is awesome.. And with the price, it's a steal... One of the best purchases in amazon.."
4,Nice design,"Wether it really works or not I don't know but for the price it is a nice shower head. I like that after 6 yrs I can still get the refills. This is my second one though. The first started to get brittle and dirty looking around the holes of the outer ring where the water comes out, those little nubs."
4,So Fresh and Clean,"This is a good shower head at a very reasonable price. I don't think you could find a better deal at a brick and mortar store.Pros:Quality name brandReasonable PriceChlorine FilterGood product warrantySuper easy to install (I'm a girly girl and I installed it in less than 5 minutes)Cons:It does droop down from weight of filter as other reviewers have noted. (I haven't found this terribly important as my shower line is placed pretty high.)I'm pleased with my purchase, find it to be a perfectly functional entry level shower head. I haven't noticed any amazing skin differences other reviewers noted, but my hair is notably softer from Chlorine filter. Highly recommended!"
5,Works I guess!,Moved to different part of Hollywood. Shower water caused intense dryness on my face even after quality moisturizer. After a few days of drynessI ordered this. Used it for 2 days and face isn't dry anymore. Cool. I feel less insecure now.Took 2 min to install. No directions needed. Common sense.Its plastic but looks like metal.
5,Great shower head,"Great shower head, full pressure love the rain setting full coverage. If looks are a necessity look elsewhere. Easy to install, most other settings are useless you will find one and probably never change it"
3,pretty cool!,makes an ordinary shower a healthy and luxurious one! i enjoy the different settings and clean feeling helps my skin. good price too!
2,Beware of fake postings from marketers,"I got this product elsewhere. It cannot do what needs to be done, which is to remove CHLORAMINES from your water. If you want real water filtration you have to use a whole house filter, combined with reverse osmosis, and it costs a lot more than this showerhead.I also want to call your attention to the many marketers who are posting reviews for products like this. You can see the ones who say amazingly glowing things about the products, but were not amazon verified purchasers. They actually are hired shills."
2,Does this do anything,"I just installed this and tested it with a kit that tests alkaline, chlorine, pH, and hardness. This shower head and filter did absolutely nothing to the water as far as these are concerned. I got it hoping to soften my hard water. Does not seem to soften the water at all."
3,Better than a showerhead w/o a filter but.......,"..it's no Commando 2000 that Cosmo Kramer on Seinfeld obtained on the black market. The pressure was decreased somewhat but I could live with it. You can tell the water was filtered as there was a big difference in the quality of the water and the bathtub is staying cleaner longer. There was a problem with the swivel head because it would not stay in place but I resolved that with a thicker washer. Easy to install.Overall, not bad for the price and delivery time was reasonable."
4,Works like a charm,"I've had dry itchy skin and scalp for a while and stumbled upon this product. Although skeptical of the claims, the filter works great. Hair immediately felt softer and silkier. I live in Florida and the water can sometimes have a sulphery smell that has also gone away. I can honestly recommend this product to anyone. I deducted a star because I wish it had the 1.5 gpm rating of the water efficient shower heads now available. They can save 2000 gallons of water a year over a 2.5 gpm."
4,I love it,"This is exactly what I was looking for. A solid water filter at a great price. I already had the one for the sink and loved that one too so figured I'd give this one a try. I will say that the water here in San Francisco is not bad, I just prefer to take out as much as I can. No idea how this handles really hard or sulfur water.Installation was simple and easy. If you have a problem installing then:1) you're not using enough tape; and/or2) you're not using the right tools; and/or3) you're not strong enough to tighten it downGreat water pressure, setting are fine though the massage setting is weak IMO, no leaking if attached correctly."
3,"Beware 97% filtration, not 99%!","This product is great with one exception. The printed material leads you to believe that the WSH-C125 has the potential to filter 99% of the impurities it claims to eliminate. This is false. All printed material that comes with the product says 97%. For me this is unforgivable. I paid more for this product specifically because it claimed 99%. I was about to purchase a different version with a 97% rating, but paid the extra for extra protection. I'll take the blame for not investigating more thoroughly, but this is an unethical way to represent the product. As far as the printed material informs the customer there is no way to achieve 99% purity with this product. I will look elsewhere when it comes time to replace the filter."
3,Little irritated,"This is not a review on the product but what was received. I was hoping to install when i got home but the packaging was missing the teflon tape, and that is what was a little irritating, also missing the reminder sticker but i don't care so much about that."
2,Not too sure it even works,"We have terrible hard water in our area and it has dried up my hair, skin etc! I was so excited to read about these and after much research I purchased it thinking it was going to be a great solution to our hard water problems. I can't say that it is terrible as far as a showerhead but it did not do what was promised. I didn't notice any difference in my hair, definitely not on my skin and the ""smell"" as everyone described was the same too. The water pressure is good and its just an ok plain old showerhead. I will not be purchasing a replacement filter and will likely just put our old showerhead back on. Very disappointed, especially since I saw such a huge amount of rave reviews! :("
2,No soft water here!,"I was excited to find a water softener on line to help soften the hard water we have in my town. However, after using it for several weeks, I find the water to have the same properties as before. My hair texture has not changed a bit. Although I like the shower head itself, I am very disappointed in the results of the softening filter."
4,a good deal,"Somebody else said, ""Well worth the $30"". I have to agree. Three weeks after installing it, my hair is better and my wife's skin is much better. We have considerably high concentrations of chlorine in the water supply where we live. I called the water department to make sure we had chlorine and not chloramine. That is the case and, so far, this thing does its job well. It's also very comfortable to shower under. The stream is of good strength and spread. The only thing that bothers me a little is that it's mostly plastic, including some crucial fitting parts.I'm still glad I bought this, though.---update---We've had this for years, now, and it still works very well and the plastic parts I had been worried about have not broken. We have moved three times and taken it off and put it back on in our new place without any problems."
4,worth it,i didnt notice a huge difference when i used the product but once i stopped i realized that it had been doing a good job all along.
5,Go buy one!,"I don't know what took me so long to buy something like this. I have extremely hard water - my stainless sink in the kitchen has to be polished daily or else there are ""water stains"" all over it. When I was at a hotel I finally decided that my old Delta shower head was well past its life expectancy. I wanted a nice, full powered shower head at home. The Delta was full of little white, hardened minerals, and there was not hope of getting a decent amount of ""spray"" from it. After a search on Amazon, I decided on the Culligan. Some reviewers have commented on a lack of water pressure. I have NOT had that problem. I have a wonderfully soothing shower every evening now! My shower stays cleaner, and I am sure that my skin and hair are better for it all. I have noticed less dry patches on my skin. I'd recommend this to anyone with hard water. Thanks, Amazon and Culligan."
2,Cow country,"We live in central california, well water that smells bad bad bad, we have a whole house filtration system, but we were hoping to diminish the sulphur, egg smell in the showers even more..this product did diminish the smell a little...not much.This might be great for city use,, for us it did not do what we needed.For the price, this is a good product. Use it for city and I think you will see the differences that they promote."
3,good shower,"A good shower head with several settings. The settings aren't too different but give a little bit of variety. The massage setting is rather useless but hey, I haven't found a massaging shower head that actually works well so I guess its just par for the course."
4,Water filter,I found an immediate difference in terms of the lather that I used to get with and without the filter. Also my hair has becomeLess dry. Looks like a good value for the money spent
4,Shower head,"After researching and trying different shower heads, the Culligan WSH-C125 has worked the best for me. I usually don't give into the hype, but this product works really well. I had previously bought the Aquasana shower filter and didn't really notice a difference in the water. With the Culligan shower filter, I noticed a big difference within two days. I even used a different body wash everyday for 4 days and still got the same results; my skin was a lot softer when I got out of the shower. I will continue to purchase the replacement filters as recommended every 6 months. However, if you take 30+ min. in the shower, you may have to replace it sooner. Overall, great shower head."
1,Poor Water Filter,I read many reviews which posted the filtered shower as great product. But I find the filtered showerhead did little to remove Sulfur odor. It is very disappointed to this product.
3,"Good, sort of...","It gets rid of about 65% to 70% of the odor and discoloration, the problem is that its too heavyand the swivel head wont stay in place, eventually it will point down because of the weight,it goes limp!The shower pressure is good.not worth more than ten buxGood but not great"
4,Good Filter,Does exactly what it preaches. However there are filters available at Home Depot which guarantee 100 % removal of Chlorine while this one removes 99% of it. Not sure if it makes much of the difference.I like this one and would definitely recommend it.
2,Not great,"I didn't notice any difference at all with my skin or hair. I'm a thin person, but the spray is really narrow and doesn't provide enough coverage. The spray selector broke the third time I turned it. I used it for about a month, but decided to replace it with my old shower head. I don't recommend it."
4,What a feeling !!!!,"HiAfter reading the previous reviews on this product I bought this one.Its cool, its easy to fix and the chrome finish gives it a metallic look.Its been only 2 weeks now and I can feel the difference in the characteristic of the water in my shower. The water is more soft now than hard before, which i can i feel in the look of my hair. My hair is more soft and lushly now. I would recommend this product if you are a first time buyers and want to try a good one that costs less. But i have to wait and see how long the filter will actually work."
3,"Great, except that it cracked.","This filter is great, unfortunately the neck of the shower head cracked after just 3 months. The craftsmanship of the product leaves something to be desired. To clarify, it wasn't the part of the neck that you tighten that cracked, but the section just below that (not sure how to describe it). I rarely even adjusted the shower head position so this should not have happened.After noticing the hairline crack around month 3 of installation I kept using it anyway, but I made sure to not move the shower head. Unfortunately, around the 5th month the crack gave and completely split which rendered it completely useless.I'm not sure if I just received a defective shower head, but I was really disappointed with its lack of quality, esp. when it received so many positive reviews."
4,In detroit this is a must...,"I'm currently going to school in Detroit and the water here has quite a bit of chlorine in it. I first noticed when I filled my bathtub and it had that unrealistically blue tint that pool water sometimes has. After living here for a month my hands and feet started getting dry and cracking after every time I took a shower. Although this product did not completely solve that problem... it definitely helped! It sounds silly but I used to have to use lotion on my hands and feet after every shower. Now I only have to after every 3 or 4 showers!!! hahahaMy only complaint is the water flow restriction. I am normally all for anything that is good for the environment so I kept it in. The problem is that whenever someone flushes the toilet the water will basically burn you. That's something that happens normally but the water flow restriction somehow made it worse. Once I removed that, it stopped burning me lol. I'm glad they made it removable!"
2,Nothing changed for me,"I didn't notice any difference in how I felt when taking this product. I do take a lot of supplements, so that may have hindered its effectiveness."
4,PortugeseFado by Amalia Rodrigues.,Could not find what I was looking for in Portugal; original and authentic Fado expression. Glad I waited to order once I got back. Amalia was the artist that I was looking for in one single CD to capture her essence. Spirit of Fado did it for me.
5,Wanting More,"Where is Mark Grover...why has he not written more? I recently discovered his book when browsing through a used book store in Seattle. He writes so beautifully and so clearly. His pros have a classic timeless quality, but he is contemporary. His words penetrate and stay in your heart. He must have more to share. I wait for more and will keep looking for new writings by this Mark Grover."
3,"ok, but not great","The book is fairly well written, though is a a little advanced. Through the chapters, many topics ""cycle""; you will see them again and again. If you are unaware that is the intention, the book seems to be everywhere without actually saying anything. It would be good if there were some sort of examples or exercises at the end so it could be used with a lab. Easy to read."
4,excellent movie,"uthor: mohsin ali khan from PakistanAfter watching the movie, I think that there should be a type ""reincarnation"" in your genre section. It is because the story of the movie revolves around reincarnation of Prabhat (Biswajeet) and Reshma (Nishi). Howerver, commenting about the movie, I will say that the movie was good to watch for one time. It cannot be rated as above average but if you have not watched it, at least watch it for one time. You will not feel bored. The music was not out standing but O.K. In fact I did not like the music while watching the movie. The acting was good. The dialogues were also good. The picturisation was also nice in the green hills of Himachal Pradesh (although the movie was Black & White). Mehmood, as a comedian did a very good job. The best thing of the movie was its script. The script is basically what is shown in the movie. So, the script was very good."
3,The frme is just plastic no SS,"I was very disappointed when I opened the package and found the frame to be just plastic. I was expecting to see a stainless steel backing. Feature listed as ""Laser cut stainless steel is the latest trend"" to me implied that stainless steel was used, I thought(buyer beware). They look good and were easy to install. One little bump will probably crack and break them. I got one for the front and back plates of the car."
5,Works great as distinguishing feature,"I bought the red license plate frame because I have a silver sedan. It makes it easy to find my car among many other similar cars in large car parks. The distinctive bright red frame is even easier to spot than I thought before I got it.Mounting it was trouble-free. I've got it mounted only with the top two screws. Despite not buying all the doohickeys sold by Cruiser for mounting it, it sits just fine. No odd noises or vibrations. I'm happy."
1,"Ahh, all the people you hate in one convenient collection.","First off, let's get one thing straight: The show is AWUFUL! So is the movie, so is this. I mean, Baha Men? . Jessica Simpson? Tim Curry! Everyone knows HE can't sing! Who put Sinead O'Conner on a soundtrack for a kids movie?! I really wonder what they're thinking most of the time on these. The only good song is Halliwell's rendition of the Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots Are Made for Walking."" the rest can be described in one word: UGH!"
3,Ok,"Hm, Pretty good soundtrack, I only got it cuz Aaron Carter's song ""Life is a party"" is on it, and not released on any other of his cds, but its got some other good stuff, but also has a VERY strange track called ""Chuckie Chan"" talk about weird, its like crazy mixed up s...! I havent seen the movie, so Im guessing that song is in a scene, but talk about annoying, there isnt really words, but sounds like some little munchkins yelling some stuff, talk about freaky expierience, I guess you have to hear it yourself. ""These boots are made for walking"" is sung by the ex-spice girl Geri..I 4get her name, and that song is horrible. ""Bad Girls"" is a kiddie song sung by angelica, once again, talk about annoying! I love the song ""Excuse My French"" By 2be3, very good! The rest you can find out on yo own! Bye 4 now!"
5,Great for Rugrats Fans!,"This is a fun CD for kids. Not exactly my kind of music (OK I admit it, I like Who Let the Dogs Out!). After seeing the movie, I decided to get this for my daughter. She likes to get up and sing and dance to it. The songs are very contemporary and who knows how long their staying power is, but just to get my daughter away from the TV is a plus. You can also use this in your computer to play a game of Sumo Motion. It lets you select dance moves for three sumo wrestlers. My daughter got a kick out of it. There are pictures and descriptions of the Rugrats characters (in case you don't know I guess). It also has links to websites and videos for Amanda and No Authority. I coudn't get the videos to work at the time of this review. It requires Quicktime. I agree that Rugrats can be a rather stupid show, but it wasn't meant to appeal to adults. If it did, the writers would be back to the old drawing board."
2,"Star Gods, Calendars & Astronomy",This book is full of the most embarassing mistakes. While the drawings are wonderful the discussion of astronomy is a real problem. I'd suggest Anthony Aveni's work (many many books) as a correction to this work.
4,Excellent for the economic value,"This book has it all, and more importantly, it was written by someone who HAS Australian shepherds (most books out there are not written by those whom actually live with them). A nice overview of the breed and the possibilities it holds. Great work."
3,"Missing part of chapter 1, all of chapter 2 and part of chapter 3","Brand new book - 2nd edition but missing pages 24 through 48!Having amazon resend another at no cost.From what *is in the book, looks good."
4,Pretty Good So Far,"I watched the movie and loved it. Altman is a master. His films have a depth and execution which other directors salivate over. I've only read the first few stories of this book so far. I'm very impressed. The stories are very short--between 5 and 10 pages each. They tie in very well to the film, but in many ways the book is superior to the film. He writes about common folk, and he speaks very plainly. It's very refreshing to see writers that don't ""talk down"" to their readers. People that talk down or have superiority complexes are very annoying. Especially when they are co-workers, and you work in retail.I work with a guy who has these kinds of annoying traits, and honestly I ignore the guy as much as possible. Everyone thinks he should be ""86ed"" from the joint but we'll have to wait and see."
5,My personal favorite in the series,"Wow, I was a little suprised to see all the negative or sub-par reviews this movie got. Yeah, I know it's incredibly cheesy, but so were all of Roger Moore's movies. For some reason, I just loved this one out of all the Bond movies the most. I don't really even know why, something about this movie just clicks for me."
4,"Bond, go do that voodoo that you do so well...","When Sean Connery finally left the Bond role for good (that is, until he returned for ""Never Say Never Again"" in 1983), it was up to veteran ""The Saint"" actor Roger Moore to take the reins.""Live And Let Die"" has some strong elements going for it: A great theme song by Paul McCartney & Wings; a genuinely creepy backdrop of menace in the form of voodoo; and a gallery of bizarre/frightening characters. Yet, the film seems half-baked, as if it might have been better with Connery there. Moore, to his credit, plays Bond in his own tongue-in-cheek style, but he lacks the ruggedness of Connery. The plot finds some moments to place Bond in mortal danger (what are the odds that a team of crocodiles are going to conveniently line up so that Bond can run across their backs to safety??), yet Moore stretches credibility by making it look too easy (as was the case in future films).Not Moore's best nor his worst, but an intriguing entry in the series."
3,Good book,The first installment of Pookie and Lil' Bit's love story will entice you to read the sequels
1,unbelievable,"i'm sad that this is the quality of writing being offered as popular african american literature. i felt embarrassed, as if i was reading a pornagraphic harlequin romance. and the overt prejudice (basically, all white people are against black people) is just absurd."
5,OUTSTANDING,I'M SORRY THAT IS TOOK ME SO LONG TO READ THIS I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT ONE. MITCHELL AND RAHIEM WERE GREAT AND I LOVED HOW YOU BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER. THE LOVE THAT THEY HAD LEFT ME SPEECHLESS I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN.
5,IT'S DAY-AM JOOD!!!,"It's taken me three years to finally read this book and all i can say is...WOW! Hardy is one jood storyteller: I am not at all familiar with the world he presents, but felt as if I were right there reading the book. I could feel Mitchell's pain when Raheim hurt him. I recognized the sense of family Mitchell has with his best friends, Babyface, B.D. and Gene. And, yeah, I felt myself reaching a climax when Mitchell and Raheim got busy! Never before have I been so entertained and enlightened after reading a book. Hardy is truly a revolutionary, a force to be reckoned with. I can't wait to sink my teeth into the other two novels. JOOD JOB!"
4,Amazing!! A New Voice in Literature!!,"I never thought a novel like this would be written. An honest portrait of young black gay life in the 1990s. So much of the so-called black gay literature is simply black gays writing for white gays. I'm so glad that this story is for ""us.""Hardy's is an amazing writer. His words can leap off of the page and into your heart. His honesty is truly shocking at times, and I loved every minute of it. Both protaganist are wonderful and I feel as if I see people like them everyday. Also, Mitchell does a beautiful job of ""reading"" all those white gays out there who try to floss to brothers now that we are the flavor of the month. A must read, if you like books at all. Why the four stars, then? Because I wished the book never ended...."
3,The book was to far fetch for me!,"I must play Devil's Advocate. I know with me leaving my E-Mail address, people are going to be blowing it up. But I can not see how a man is going to let another man come into his home, run it and disrespect him like he paid rent. I cant see it. No matter how hard pressed you are, or how well you claim he was good in the bed. I must give the author his props for hitting on the sterotypes, and placing a clear prespective of the racial tension among African-Americans and Caucasians. Wearing the mans clothes around the house. Come on Now! That was to queenish, and subservient White Girlish. I am a 32 year old African-American Male, and I have been in the life for a while, and I came across a lot of brothers that had their certain shields up, in order to prevent someone from peeping their card. But no matter how Banjee, Big, Built, Beautiful, and all the other ""B's"" that you can come up with. They came with respect and gave respect."
5,Blues...,I couldn't keep my face out of this book. I tell everyone about this book. This book is about a gay relationship. It is just like a relationship between a man and a woman... it's just a bit more freakier... alot of detail too.I recommend this book to anyone... Especially Gay people... This book is so funny... I love it...
3,Half way decent but too much hype,"JEH's series was ground breaking at a time when there was (and still is) very little representation of gay/sgl black men in literature. However, I'm depressed at the idea that this book is supposed to be THE representation of young men in the life. The writing is overly simplistic and I got tired of Hardy's obsessive and heavy-handed preaching about black/white relations. Furthermore, I took severe issue with the way this novel handled the issue of partner abuse. So are gay men supposed to follow the example of Mitchell and put up with being punched because a good man is so hard to find? I think not!"
3,... Book Review of B-Boy Blues,"B-Boy Blues was our December 2001, book of the month. It was about one man's desire to date a ""ruff-neck"". When he finally gets the perfect one (after several failed attempts) he ends up falling in love and Mr. Perfect is not so perfect. Mr. Hardy touches powerful issues such as: two people trying to work on their relationship, physical abuse/violence, jealousy, attraction to a particular type of person, gays/lesbians being ""in the closet"" and parenting.The topics mentioned above sparked much member dialogue and at times became a little heated. On a whole, we gave this book 3 amazon stars. The feedback from the club ranged from disappointed to how the gay community was portrayed to disapproval of the slang usage. We commend all authors and understand the perils of writing, but Mr. Hardy's B-Boys, didn't make us want to run out and buy his latest."
3,I was devastated,"I was devasteated by the tone of this book. As a white man who has lived with and loved a black man for almost 20 years, I couldn't believe the hostility expressed in the book about white people. I know it exists, of course, but somehow I felt that our relationship is above all that. My lover has not been able to finish the book, and refuses to really talk about it. True, some of the things the author says about white people's attractions to black people are ture, but after a very short span of time, you thank God that the attraction was there just so you had the opportunity to get to know that person for who he really is, otherwise, we would have NEVER met, with those restrictions placed on us by our parents, peers, and whoever else wanted to run our lives. I'm glad the book was written, but it was like finding out about Santa Claus and my parents doing the nasty all in the same week at the age of 8"
1,NO JOOD,"This was the absolute worst book I have ever read. It was incredibly juvenile and I simply became ill every time I read the word ""jood."" It was not very realistic, I was sick of reading how they kissed ""down"" and the way Raheim reacts to Mitchell in one scene is downright disturbing! Would it have been done this way if this were a story about heterosexuals? There's more to a relationship than sex and kissing ""down."" I think if I were a little younger, perhaps 15 or so I would have enjoyed this book, however, since I am 23 years old-I have to say I will NOT be purchasing books 2 and 3."
4,B-Boy is almost an A! Very Gripping and HOT!,"B-BOY BLUES is the coming together love story of young black journalist Mitchell Crawford and yummy muscled B-boy messenger Raheim Rivers. The two meet at a bar and sparks fly --- but it isn't until their first date that those sparks catch fire and really begin to blaze. Mitchell and Raheim quickly discover that despite their different life-experiences, backgrounds, obstacles, conditions, and basically worlds - they're meant to be together. They're so right together. This is a grand romance in an almost classical style that skillful captures the trials and triumphs of this charismatic couple. Along the way this gripping read provides lots of snappy dialogue, great characters, some phenomenal sex scenes, and emotionally moving moments as well. In addition to being a big juicy read B-BOY BLUES is a frank depiction of life from divergent sides of the African-American experience. And I love when books I love has SEQUELS!"
5,THIS BOOK IS THE BOMB!!!,"This book was very good, a lot of sex scenes but the main point of the book was very interesting and enlighting I feel that you have to really pay attention to the book if you want to follow it because it is sort of written in a fast pace but very good and enjoyable to read. I feel that Mit and Raheim had a very nice and cute as well as an interesting relationship I am glad that they found each other because Mit wanted to find a b-boy and Raheim wanted to be loved so they were just right for each other!!!:)"
3,"Ahh,a ghost!","If you like ghost stories read this book called ""The Ghost Sitter.""It's about a girl named Charlotte she lives in a house that is haunted by a girl named Susie that died in the garage of that house and her sister told her to stay in the house until she comes back. If you like this review read this book, beware you might be scared while you read it or cry at the end."
3,It could be better,"I think ""Ghost Sitter"" was interesting but it didn't have very good detail. And it is a ghost story and I think that they should be scary.I did like the characters and how they were played and I think that the way that Charlotte helped Susie was a very cool thing. It did have me at the edge of my seat and at certain spots I could not put it down.I was always wondering if Charlottes parents we goin going to believe that there really was a ghost in her house and if they would ever see what Charlotte and Shannon see. I would not like to read it again because it did bore me a little."
3,The book review you will read!!,"Charlet Verstuyft`s family moves into a new house, where she meets her new neighbor, Shannon Kohn, who trys to believe there is a ghoat in her (Charlet`s)house. Later on Charlets little brother, Brandon, has, what Charlets mom thinks is a new imagenary friend, but then the Verstuyft go to barbeque at the Kohn`s house, where they tell the story about ""Spariler Susie"" which gets Charlet woundering. So the girls hold a seance. Susie tells them about her sister and they find her.Its a good book if you are 11 or younger. Its better than my review because i have to hurry to get it done."
3,Ghost Sitter,"The book Ghost Sitter is a good book it is mysterious. It is about a girl named Charlotte who moves into a new house she thinks her life is great because she has her own room and neighborhood pool and there's even a Fouth of July block party coming up soon. The only bad thing is she has to watch her little brother Brandon! She meets one of her neighbors Shannon who tells her that the house is haunted, and what she has seen in that house but Charlotte doesn't belive her. But when her brother who is usually a pain starts acting good all of the sudden and is asking for his friend Suzie. Things get weird. This is a good book.It will get you to the tip of your chair woundering what's ganna happen next! This is an exciting book."
5,Be Prepared to fear the unknoun,"The Ghost Sitter, by Peni R. Griffin, is abouta girl named Susie Miller. Susie dies from a firework accident. After awhile, she turns into a ghost. She promises her sister, Gloria, she will never leave the house. Gloria's the only one that can see her because she's little. Then about 50 years later, a girl moves into the house. Can she help Susie find her parents?I like that it is a mix of realistic fiction and fantasy. I was jumping out of my seat at all of the surprises there were. I loved it! The author didn't need to do anything better. She explained everything perfectly! I had a great time reading it.This book also taught me an important lesson. It is you can help people at all times. In the story, Charlotte was trying to help a friend find her parents and they developed a great friendship. It helped me learn this lesson and it can help you too."
4,Very Good Durability,"Say you have a lot of DS games and you have nowhere to put them. If you're normal, you probably don't want to carry around all their cases.[ I mean, come on! That would look f*****g stupid!!!] This case is for you if you agreed to the things above. It has room for plenty of DS games, and extra room to put the instruction manuals. But, if you are like me and only have a few games, then I would recommend for you to buy the starter kit that has a couple of tiny, plastic cases that fit very easily in your pocket. This case isn't crappy.I mean, it has a lot of durability, like say if you dropped it. But it is only recommended to people who have a lot of DS games. Hope this review helps DS owners!!! Good luck!!!"
2,Deep Trenches,"This work manages a scholarly blend of pastiche, obscurity, and stayed artistic license; lavoirs---sounds and looks to be a very personally satisfying revolution! A true combination of child-like wonder which can appeal to most adults and begs the question---what ever happened to the Sugar Daddy?"
1,Tommytune,"I really enjoy digs which reveal patterns of the rural to urban shift useful to today's real planning issues; this is a journey that remains haunted and, in doing so, fails to exemplify work beyond stylistic fancieries."
4,"In need of better proof-reading, but still a good read","Continuing the ""Wizard in Rhyme"" adventures of the Lord High Wizard of Merovence and his friends and family, this volume pairs our hero with a young, female apprentice (with the self-protective ability to transform into a cat and a difficulty coming up with endings for her spells) in order to retrieve his children from a vile kidnapper. Like all the novels in this series, Stasheff does a wonderful job of combining medieval myths and legends with lively, likable characters. However, the story is marred by errors in proof-reading (changing the names of characters or cities back and forth, often several times within a few pages, where paragraphs from earlier drafts with different names seem to have been incorporated without correction). Enjoy the story, but beware those editing mistakes."
5,Love this stuff.,"I'm an avid adventurer... and in my travels I've come to a big realization: Simplicity=reliability. That's why I don't like battery powered gizmos when I camp.Put this on your candle lantern to have a nice spot of readable light directly underneath. I usually (carefully) hang this in my tent directly above my book position, provides a nice ambiance, and smell with a beeswax candle. Beware: Bears, skunks, and coons know the smell of beeswax too... they can smell it for miles.Polish one side of this for added reflection. Great addition to my lantern!"
3,Not what I thought,"Unconquered started off as an interesting historical read but quickly turned into a quick wrapped up ending. Drogo and Eada became frustrating, with Eada constantly running off and putting herself in danger, how many times can he save her? I liked the secondary characters such as Brun, May and Ivo, but would of liked to see a more detailed ending. All of a sudden Drogo and Eada where back at Eada's property and we didnt get to see what happened to the rest of the group. What happened to her family? Did May, Ivo and Brun react to Eada all of a sudden being a rich land owner? The reason I gave this book only three stars is it just seemed a little too unrealistic but I did find some of the descriptions of the battles and the trek to London interesting."
5,Great Job Hannah Howell,"Hannah Howell has created a wonderfully engaging medeival love story without the following elements that I hate to find in romances. First, a hero who does not try to tame or break the heroine. He likes her strong will and respects her intelligence. He also does not rape or enslave the heroine as most heroes do in these Norman/Saxon love stories. Second, a heroine who is strong and feisty while being mature, practical and intelligent at the same time. Third, secondary characters who take an active part in the story and have the reader caring about what happens to them also.I cannot begin to say how much I enjoyed this story. I also liked the ending. Without giving anything away, I will just say that the hero lets his love guide him and as a result gets everything he had been after. Read and find out for yourself."
5,When They Lay Bare,"This book is the best novel I have read for a long time. It reads like poetry, with not a word out of place: the story line is gripping, and now, days after having finished it, the characters are still all running around in my head, refusing to go away. Beautiful and spellbinding, I'd recomend it to anyone.The style reminds me a little of Janet Turner Hospital--another author I admire."
1,"Great Concept, Horrible product","Although this is a great idea and couldn't wait to use it, I was greatly disappointed. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He tried it out and there were many problems with it. First off, the wire continued to short so the music went in and out. Secondly, if you have your MP3 player selected (Ipod) there is no way of changing songs or switching to radio without getting your MP3 player wet or letting your MP3 player battery waste away while you listen to the radio. I returned this item and I hope to get a full refund."
1,POOR quality,"I got this as a Christmas present and two months later it no longer gets the one FM station that I want to listen to. Never tried the iPod chamber, because it does not look like a very safe place for my iPod to be in a wet environment. This thing is a total waste of money. Now I need to find a better option!"
2,"Mirror is good, sound is good, radio not so much","Everything works fine, except the tuner is terrible. Got this to listen to radio as opposed to iPod since it's not worth it to me to chance getting iPod wet. Tuner gets about 2 or 3 stations--that's all. Too bad b/c everything else is great."
2,cheapo,I was not very impressed with this product. It is large and made of cheap plastic. If u have 30 or 80 ipod it is very difficult to put into the radio. It is so difficult that we dont even bother using it anymore. The radio reception is not the best either. We have only used it a handful of times because it just is not worth the time to put the ipod in and out. We just went back to our old shower.
2,mmm,"my Ipod didn't fit so I had to return it.. It seemed sturdy, and I would have bee willing to give it a go, if it would have fit"
1,PIECE OF CRAP!!!!,"Don't buy this product... it is junk!! I can't believe that Amazon would even sell this garage sale type stuff on their site. First, the sound quality is like listening to a high pitch screaming kid, you can't put the volume higher than 2... it is impossible becase you will have hearing problems and your ears may to start to bleed. It is that bad! second... I hope you work out, because you need it to turn these knobs. It is so poorly made, that it is sitting in my garbage can as im typing this now. THE WORST PRODUCT EVER. Oh, and by the way.. the mirror FOGS UP EVERYTIME!"
1,Piece of crap,"Sorry to say it, but this was just a crappy crappy item. The mirror fogged within a day. The radio buttons are to stiff and too small to even attempt to operate with wet slippery hands (could barely operate them with dry hands). My iPhone doesn't fit and even if it did, I wouldn't trust this to keep a $400 phone dry. Not in a million years."
2,Keep Shopping -,Should have kept shopping for a good shower mirror. First of all it's not a mirror but a piece of shiny plastic film that gives the appearance of a carnival clown mirror - distorts your face so much you can't shave because you're laughing too hard. Poor quality all around - sorry. Put my ipad in it and the design is you have to try and operate it through a piece of plastic that makes it virtually impossible.Radio does work fine.....Should have bought a simple mirror instead.
1,Terrible waste of money,"Radio is horrible, if you can find a station- we have a million stations here and your are lucky if you can get one to come in half way clear on this piece of trash. The mirror fogs almost instantly. The mp3 plug works but the compartment for your mp3 leak horribly too. Worth about $5 in my opinion"
2,bad sound,"Bottons are hard to rotate and speakers are bad. The sound is terrible and you don't understand the lyrics. I dont like it that much, If I have the oportunity again I prefer not to buy it and get a better option."
4,Shower Radio,I purchased the mirror/radio for my daughter and she informs me the radio works well but at times becomes statically. Ipod player works well. Overall not a bad deal for your money and my daughter enjoys the music while she showers.
1,"DO NOT BUY ""THIS RADIO STINKS""","Do not buy this radio. It is terrible. It didn't even last me 1 year. the sound goes off and on.the mirroris cheap and once it gets fogged, impossible to clean. certain am stations I would get on FM 1010 wins. it is the worst $16 I ever spent. true with the saying that youget what you pay for. Never again."
1,Lousy Product,The radio is impossible to tune and it doesn't mount of a wall with suction cups - which it mentioned. I am throwing it out and replacing it with a simple mirror.
4,Worth it,It is made of cheap plastic and requires batteries. The sound quality is great. My only complaint is that there is no way to change the song on your mp3 player once you place it in the compartment.
5,Great find!,"I received this radio as a gift, and liked it enough to buy another to give as a gift. The reception on the radio is nothing like a regular stereo, but I didn't expect that from a shower radio so I'm happy with it. I get my favorite stations, and the ipod compartment is a fun addition. Definitely recommend it!"
2,FM Radio does not work,"The FM radio only got 2 stations, maybe 3. The knobs are difficult to turn and the light on mine would not turn off. I am afraid to try it with my MP3 player. The radio no longer gets ANY stations and just makes static. I gave 2 stars because I don't know how well it would work with the MP3 player, but as a shower radio it sucks."
5,Great Product and Great Seller!,"My daughter loves this lady bug night light, especially since she can change the colors! It sure makes bedtime easier at our house. I would definately recommend this product!"
5,Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!,Seriously fantastic. It is like having those glow in the dark stars on your ceiling but removable. Provides a soft glow of night sky on the ceiling; just enough of a night light for our toddler (and for us if we need to go in there) & it looks plain cool. I am just so happy with this purchase!
3,Pink ladybug,Love the design and color of the ladybug super cute! The stars and moons colors are beautiful when you look up at them Wish it played music.
4,Pretty neat product,"This is a nice gift for any toddler -- my son does not have trouble falling asleep, but this still serves as a nice ""treat"" for him to go to bed. It's neat that he feels included in selecting the color before he goes to bed; although, this is where the 4 stars rests... there's no option for a ""color-changing"" during the 45 minute session; they're just stuck with whatever color you first select. No big deal, just seems like an additional, interesting function that I would personally use. Other than that, it projects nicely and illuminates a large surface area. The turtle's size is compact and it is not unattractive decor; seems like it could fit in nicely with any gender or bedroom style."
4,Great night light,Pretty nice item we had to purchase to replace a similar product from other manufacturer. This one only turns off and on in 3 different colors and nothing else special.
4,Good for the money,"My daughter LOVES this toy. We have named it and created an entire back story for it (she's four) already. It absolutely EATS batteries, so we can't leave it on all night as a nightlight like we had intended. Still, it is good for sleep overs and for evenings when it gets dark early. We bring it out into the living room and admire the stars on the ceiling. It has a feature that lets it change the light colors it projects so the stars change colors. That setting is her favorite. I think we are going to buy the adapter to plug it into the wall though so we can actually use it as a nightlight. Other than the battery problem, its great and our daughter loves it. can't ask for more than that. Plus it is pretty cute without being hot pink or having a stupid grin on its face. that's nice as well."
3,Great Idea...,"Even though this night isn't what I expected it to be, my daughter still loves it and uses it every night. It has three color options, red, blue, and green. The red and green are pretty much useless unless your walls are painted black. The night light features a timer, which goes off probably 15mins after being turned on. It is a disadvantage really, because sometimes it takes my daughter awhile to fall asleep and she lets me know when it goes off. Another downside is that the stars do not move. The ladybug nightlight would be perfect if it did not shut off unless it was turned off, if the stars rotated, and if the red and green where changed to yellow and pink or other lighter colors."
5,Twilight,My 4 year old Grandson just loves this Night Light. This Turtle travels with him. Mommy and Daddy think this is one of the best Items PA PA has ever given him.
2,Faulty button design,"This turtle is a cute concept, however, the buttons to turn it on are poorly designed. I purchased two...had to send one back because the button had fallen inside the turtle...After a week use, the other turtle's button fell inside also.Very disappointing"
2,Way to Expensive for What You Get,"The Grandparents sent this to our 2 yr old son. The first one did not work when we received it. We had to send back at our cost and they re-sent us one which worked. You have to put it close to the ceiling and in the middle of the room for the stars to look like anything recognizable. Who normally places a tall piece of furniture right in the middle of your child's room?? It has a constellation chart, which is useless, because the stars are blurry and distorted in arrangement. The colors don't change automatically and it seems to be more of a distraction to my son's falling asleep than anything. When I saw the list price for this in an airline magazine, I was astounded. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this cheap novelty item."
2,"great concept, bad execution","I bought this item because it had good reviews, and looked really cool. It's a turtle with 3 different colored LED lights on the inside that are supposed to project stars in a room or on a ceiling.Of the 3 colors - green, amber and blue - only the green and blue are noticable in pitch black. The amber is almost a waisted option because you can't see it.My problem with this item is it only works in pitch black, and barely in that case. The product shots show it sitting on a nursery floor shining up at the ceiling, this is sooooo impossible. The turtle needs to be at least 2 feet from the ceiling in order to see any of the stars.A total disappointment. I returned it."
2,Not Getting Moneys Worth,"I bought this expecting alot more, it has 3 buttons to change colors and thats all it does. There is no movement ,no sound nothing, it just shows stars in 1 spot and 1 spot only.. Not worth the money.."
4,Cute Ladybug,"I thought this was a NEAT idea but the projector isn't as strong as I was hoping for. You have to set it on something closer to the ceiling to really see the stars/constellations. Although, that's probably a good thing if this is used to make the baby sleepy (Dont' want to excite the little one with all the commotion of the lights!) It's a cute idea and I'm glad I bought one. My daughter is only ten months right now and doesnt use it, but I know when she's older she will. Overall, glad I purchased it. Great for the Price!!!"
5,Great product,"Highly recommend this product~ It is soft enough to hold, remains cool to touch and is very lightweight. My kids love these! We have this and a turtle one."
1,Greatly Disappointed,"During the last year, my 3 year-old has become fascinated by the stars and the planets. He can recognize the Big Dipper and Orion; he often asks me to point out Pegasus. His grandmother thought that the Twilight Turtle would be terrific not so much as a night light, but as an educational toy. The box even suggests ""ideal for ages 3 to adult"". We were all greatly disappointed. The constellations are indistiguishable unless the turtle is less than a foot from the ceiling. Furthermore, the white light blurs the points of the stars. Lastly, (and I know I'm nit-picking here) the constellations are incorrectly sized and misplaced when compared to the actual night sky. The twilight turtle maybe more suitable for an infant, but my son is growing past the need for a night light. We are going to return it."
1,awful,from what i had read i thought it would be pretty cool. was very upset when i got it. it broke in a couple of days. i sent it back
1,Overpriced for a low tech toy,"Stars do not move, no music to play. Only faint light projects stars onto the wall. It's hardly interesting."
4,Neat Toy......,"After reading reviews, which I always take with a grain of salt, ordered this when the price dropped....I like it, works fine..Yes, the amber is a bit dim, need to have a completely dark room for it--I like the green the best. Our daughter likes to play with it on the foor/bed. I swirl it slowly around her,just above her head, and she tries to grab the stars...cute!"
4,adorable!,love this ladybug. adorable! lights up the whole ceiling - a moon and a million stars. green and blue are the brightest. red is not that bright. doesn't show up that much. overall - great product!
5,Twightlight Turtle,"I was trying to find a good, safe, american made...toy that would shine tiny stars on the ceiling of my preemie grandsons nursery. I accidently stubbled on this, and I am so, so pleased, and so is my grandson Braiden. Its american made, so no worries about that, and its very soft, except of course, his shell, which is handpainted and has wee holes, which at night when you turn it on, shine starlight all over his room. First few nights, he just laid there and giggled himself to sleep. I highly reccomend this item!!"
5,So great we now have 2!,My son has the turtle and has used it now for 2 years (he is now 4) he loves it as he is a little scared of the dark and it helps him focus on the stars rather than the darkness and my 22 month old daughter loved it so much and wanted to turn the lights on every night that Santa gave her the ladybug one for Christmas this year for her new big bed. It really helped her have something to focus on to get to sleep with being a little nervous about going into a big bed. I would highly recommend this for anyone who has a kid who is not so eger to go to bed or is a little scared of the dark.
2,Not very durable,"This turtle is a nice concept, but , the buttons to turn it on are not designed to be durable. I purchased three had to send one back because the button had pushed inside the turtle After a while, one of the other turtle's button fell inside also and I was not able to repair it on my own. The third one has been okay."
1,FAKE CloudB Turtle Sent to Me!,BUYER BEWARE! I bought the Cloud B Twilight Turtle for my son's first birthday thinking it was fulfilled by Amazon because that's what it said. I received a cheap knock off which is dangerous!! I can't believe that Amazon fulfillment sent me out a cheap knock off children's product! I contacted them and what's worse is Amazon ALREADY KNEW ABOUT IT. But yet they didn't contact me about it. I had to contact them to get my refund! I'm afraid parents are unknowingly giving this product to their children. Amazon should immediately contact all people who bought this item and let them know it's a fake and they should discontinue using it!!!!!!
1,cheap knock-off buyer beware,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!! cheap knock-off. I repeat this is not a CLOUD B.I own 1 cloub b for my son, so I bought this one from KINGMAN for afriend of mine. Well guess what,it is not a cloud b very cheaply madeand only a few dollars cheaper then from cloub b's site.they told me you get what you pay for) well I thought I was Payingfor a cloud b. like I said DO NOT BUY,NOT A CLOUD B."
5,instant classic,"This is such a wonderful gift to provide a toddler comfort about sleeping in the ""dark"" the Turtle is soft enough that it can be in bed...The light stars produce a wonderful distraction! Wonderful item!"
4,Cool product,The screw for the batteries is very soft and I stripped it out trying to get it out. Other than that it's great.
4,Love the Twilight Turtle,"Bought the Twilight Turtle for our 6-month old daughter and we all love it! She loves to look at the stars and moon and they have a very calming effect on her. I agree with other reviewers that the yellow/gold light is very faint, even in a pitch-black room, the blue is our favorite. Have recommended to several of our friends and will be getting some as gifts for others."
4,"Fun, Great addition to our son's room.","Great product! My son loves his turtle, and turns it on almost every night. The colors are great. The blue and green stand out the most. I would suggest this to any parent."
3,Too low bright,"The product quality is ok, but the leds don't bright too much, I tried on a completely dark room, and I was expecting to see brighter stars."
4,Ladybug Nightlight,"My son really enjoys the nighlight. It provides a feeling of security at bedtime especially for him, having a harder time to fall asleep than his older brother. We have not yet explored the educational value (different constellations)of the nightlight but soon we will. Great product!"
3,Lights are pretty but doesnt help my child go back to sleep..,"Im not sure why I thought the stars rotated, but they dont. My child likes to look at the lights but tends to watch the actual turtle shell insted. This item is pretty but in no way helps my child go back to sleep."
5,Great product!,It really does cover the ceiling with realistic constellations. Very soothing. We ae tempted to get a second one for our room too :-)
5,One Of The Best Toys,"This ladybug is among the best toys our boy has hoarded in his first year. It's also the only one he treats with any respect, gently patting it on the back instead of banging on it like he does with just about everything else. The ladybug transforms any ordinary room into a dreamy nightscape. Absolutely wonderful."
4,Fun Night Light,"I bought this for my 4 year old and the turtle for my 15 month old. They both love them. The stars don't show a constellation, they don't move, and yes, as other reviewers point out, aren't all that bright. BUT, the animals are cute, these are easy to turn on/off, and in a dark room they project just fine. We found its a great part of the bedtime routine and help signal that its time to sleep.For a 5 star rating I would have liked brigher stars and animation."
4,Happy with the purchase,"I would have loved it a little more if it came w/ music, but overall it's light, not too big, and amazes both of my little girls. Love that it's unique and since our youngest little one has been our ""ladybug"" since she was born, it's perfect"
2,"Was great at beginning, lights burned out quickly",My kids loved to look at the constellations on their ceiling. The colors were blue or green. It helped them to get to sleep. It does not work at all after a few months. The lights do not burn brightly enough to shine on the ceiling.
2,Great for just a little while,"Was great while it worked. My 1yr old loved it, but it died on us really quick. Tried to change the batteries that I believe were included, but you first have get past the screw securing the batteries. That required using a scewdriver and needle nose pliers simultaneously. Once I had access to the batteries I found they were corroded in there pretty well. I tried to just wipe it down, but new batteries just didn't work. Then I tried to take the whole plastic compartment out in the hopes of giving it a better cleaning and seeing if there was something else wrong, only to find out the rest of the screws were basically just holding back the stuffing and there is no way of taking it apart. Just threw it away at that point."
3,"Entertaining, but depends on the purpose.","We bought this for our 21 month old daughter as she started to show interest in shining the flashlight in dark rooms and we thought that a constellation projector would be awesome! Well, in essence, it works really well for the purpose of a more entertaining flashlight and moon identifier, but doesn't really catch her attention beyond that. It would be awesome if it twinkled or somehow rotated to keep her interest.Anyhow, it totally serves it's purpose as a nightlight, if that's what you're getting it for. We don't put it in her room for that purpose as it would totally distract her, but for babies and less active kids-- sure, great nightlight!"
4,Great Night light,We love this product! Our son is almost 2 and loves to watch the moon and stars when he goes to bed. He asks for it if we don't turn it on. It is also nice that it shuts off automatically.This is the 2nd one we purchase because the batteries melted in the 1st one. Not sure why. This why I give it a 4 and not a 5.
5,great night light for kids,"Looked in stores for nightlight plush, priced considerably higher even when on sale. Found this turtle on Amazon, very cute and my grandson loves it!"
3,Very nice toy,Why is it so expensive just bcoz too much in demandShud have been a liltle cheaper to have reallyValue for money
3,kids like it,I like this product but not really as a night light my children love it because its fun for us to look at the stars in there room and read books with a small light near by.We also play games with it there favorite is find the moon lol i will turn it on face it down while holding it and move it around and since theres only one moon they have to find it over and over again we mostly play with it but my 5yr old sometimes sleeps with it as a night light. I do like it
5,Not just for Kids,"I bought this for my niece and it turns out that my sister dog had a blast as well, trying to catch all the stars."
5,Awesome,my neice loved it. She refused to put it down and it even got her to stop crying when she had to head back home!
4,Simple but enjoyed,"This is a very simple toy concept. It doesn't play music, it doesn't spin or move it just shines tiny little stars all around the room but my son who is 2 now has loved it since birth. We've spent lots of quality time with it in his room exploring light, color and simple wonderment and joy. Sometimes it's the simple stuff that makes a child's eyes light up. 3 color modes, batteries last a long time."
3,Cloud b Twilight night light,I bought this for daughter & she loves it. I just wish the color would change.
4,our son loves his turtle,We have had Twilight turtle for over 3 years now. This was our son's night light when he was smaller. We traveled with it and everything. The only issue we have had is that the fabric keeps separating from the shell of the turtle and it is not particularly easy to reattach it (I find gorilla glue works fairly well for this).
4,Very cute addition to baby's or child's room!,"The stars and moons fill the ceilings and walls. I love that you can change the colors, it would be great if the images danced around or moved in some way, but they are stationary. I bought it for our newborn's nursery and love it! It really is calming and interesting for little ones to stare at as they drift off to sleep."
3,Great Idea,"I really like the Twilight Turtle but the amber lights can barely be seen on the ceiling. We have to use the green or blue. The blue is definately the brightest (not too bright) so we use it the most. The green is pretty good as well. Unfortunately, the amber is so light that we can't use it."
3,"Great concept, mediocre execution","I bought the twilight turtle for my son as he loves to look at lights on the ceiling. The turtle is a great concept, but the light is not really powerful to make the stars really stand out on the ceiling if you place the turtle on the floor (as the directions say to do). I put the turtle on the dresser, and that has helped the stars show up more. It is an OK product."
1,Multiple Defective Units,"We got one of these as a gift and liked the amount of light it put in the room when we needed to check on our son. However it was tempermental when the batteries needed to be changed. I had to shake it and tap it just right to get it to come back on after a fresh set of batteries. Finally it wouldn't come back on at all so we wrote it off as a bad unit and ordered a new one.We first tried lithium batteries immediately out of the box so we wouldn't have to change the batteries as often. The lights would not come on at all. However, it did work with the included generic AAA batteries. Those died after about a month and of course the turtle would not turn back on after a change. Tried lithium ion and several sets of standard AAAs but no luck. I won't be buying another turtle light. I will also stay away from the sea turtle and ladybug from the same company, and I recommend you do the same."
5,perfect gift,this was the perfect gift for my nephew to brighten up his room at night. It is very cute and useful too
2,Thought we had a winner,"Bought this for my daughter last year, she loved(s) it. But about 2 months ago the blue light went so faint you can't use it. A few weeks later, the green light faded. Now we can only uses the red, which she doesn't like. I took it apart looking for a way to change the bulb, completely enclosed. Checked the reviews online, found out there is no way to change the bulbs. Went and bought the brand name this time for Christmas."
4,love this turtle!,perfect as a gift to any child. turtle is very soft but the shell is hard so be carefully leaving it in cribs or beds over night.
3,wish I could turn off timer feature,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old who is having trouble sleeping in the dark. She loves the projection while she falls asleep (it is a very high quality projection, the stars and moon are very clear) However, the turtle turns itself off after 45 minutes automatically which is not very helpful when my daughter wakes up in the middle of the night in darkness again. Would give it 5 stars if I could choose to have it on all night. Timer is no good for us!"
3,Nice highlights but music setting Too Loud!,I bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. They love them! The light work great but the music setting is VERY LOUD! We can hear it downstairs clearly- our bedrooms are upstairs.As far as I know there's no way to adjust the volume.
4,Turtle Night Light,This little guy is wonderful. Different colored lights to choose from. Very soothing way to wind down before bed for our son.
5,Beautiful!,"I bought this for my nephew, and he loves it, he is 6 months old and his parents use it for when he goes to sleep. My brother and wife were also very impressed by it, since it is a toy that is well thought out and crafted for children of all ages."
5,Absolutely Enchanting,"I purchased this to put in my babies' nursery. They are 3 months and 18 months. We bought the lady bug version and I just logged on to purchase the turtle one for my sons room, who instantly wanted one once they saw this one. Our rooms are pretty dark, so the red, green, and blue colors all show up beautifully. There is something magical about staring at the stars in your bedroom and my kids and babies absolutely adore this product. I wish I would have bought it sooner when I saw it on the shelves at Von Maur a few months ago. I would recommend this for any age child (and secretly, I think this would be a neat thing to have in my own room, shhh... don't tell my kids!)"
4,Great Good Night Tool,"My 2 1/2 year old twins love this turtle! Everynight we say good night to the turtle, one gets to turn it on and one gets to pick the star color. Makes for a super sweet night time routine."
5,Just what my son wanted!,I bought this for my son becuase of his facination with stars and his inability to sleep without a nightlight. He loved it. The buttons are very simple to use and the turtle is solidly constructed. Battery life is excellent also.
3,Not bright enough :(,"I bought this for...me!I wanted it in the bedroom on the nights that hubby had to work--I loved the idea of stars on my ceiling.However, it simply isn't bright enough. I tried it on the floor, on the bed, on top of the tv. I'm really disappointed with it. If I hold it up nearer to the ceiling, it is quite nice--but only with the blue light on. I can't see the stars with the amber or green lights on."
4,really cool,Our 4 month old loves this. She if stares at it with amazement. I think it feels pretty well made so I'm happy overall
3,does what I purchased for,orange hue is not so visible unless the room is dark. Looks solid. Wish there are more colors! Kids like it.
4,Love this night light,"Great night light, helped to ease my son into falling asleep on his own. The amber is a little faint, the other two colors are great. My only recommendation would be to make the lights change. Overall great product."
5,Oh my stars...,I purchased this little turtle night light for my soon-to-be born. I may have to buy another as it is so beautiful and soothing I want to keep one in our room as well. The constellations are easily recognizable as is the included guide booklet. I would most certainly recommend this sweet turtle for anyone who wants to bring the night sky indoors.
4,Love it.....,"Great purchase, has my 7 month old very interested! He loves looking at the stars and quiets when we put it on. Only reason it didn't get a 5 is cause it could be a little brighter, especilly the amber - we like the blue best. Very happy with it overall, worth the money."
4,"""cloud b Twlight""","It is wonderful. I reccomed it highly. Bought one for my Mother. She has since purchased 2 more, for family or friends. @ least 4 stars."
3,good nightlight,"The turtle serves as a sweet nightlight because the shell glows, but it has to be placed very close to the ceiling in order for the stars to actually have any shape. I put my daughter's turtle on her dresser and it just made pale blobs of colored light on the walls and ceiling. In order to actually discern the blobs as stars, the turtle had to be lifted to within a couple feet of the ceiling."
3,Cute But Doesn't Work Too Well,"I agree with the posting on high ceilings and not being able to see it very well. I bought this when I was pregnant to decorate the nursery in - it is cute and is cute for decoration, but you have to put it up high, and in a central location of the room - otherwise you cannot see the lights well. Ours seems to go off quick and the amber lights are hardly visible. I used to use it for when our son was an infant and would wake for his nighttime feedings and it was good that way since it didnt give off that much light."
4,Twilight Turtle Comfort,"This turtle is not only for kids! I bought it for my daughter's 18th birthday, who is going away for college, to keep in her dorm. She uses it now, as a night light in her room so she will have a little bit of home to take with her. I gave it a ""4"" only because it would be GREAT to have an auto-turn off to save battery life, and the controls are a bit tough to get to, but understandably, due to assure safety for the intended audience: babies!"
5,Better Than Expected,This product fills the ceiling and walls with constellations. Very cool! My 4 moth old loves it- as does his 10 year old sister!
5,KIDS LOVE IT!!!,I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She LOVES it!!! Everyone that has come to our house loves it too. The batteries last over 6 months with nightly use. I love that we can (and do) take it with us when we travel. I have since bought 3 more to give as gifts. It is my new must have gift that I give out for Christmas & birthdays. Great gift for kids 2 to 14 (adults too)!
5,Must have,If you have a child < 12 years old then you must buy this cool toy.It is not for a large room.Batteries are included. To turn it on use the bottom switch then press one of the top buttons.Update:I bought another two for friends.
4,Cute!,My kids got this when they were infants. It is cute and puts lots of stars on the walls they loved that. As they got older it became more of a problem and eventually the shell got broke. Also at one point the buttons broke from over use. But over all its a good toy for a nightlight.
2,Not sure where the hype is coming from.,"I was SO excited to get this for my 2 year old's birthday. Then, when we actually tested it out, I felt horrible for giving it to him. The stars barely show up, especially the 'orange' one. Even in the darkest room, it is not impressive. Any bit of light and the stars are near impossible to see. My son has not showed interest in this and it has been almost a year now."
4,Great!,Thi is an excellent product. I'm so glad I bought this for my son. The downside is when I got it it was scratched. It could have been from the shipping but it was still a little irritating.
4,amazing red light!,"I bought first the turtle and then I had to buy a new one for my little daughter which wants something as her sister .. it is a very nice ladybug with the red light, my children liked it a lot and I recommend it for those who has children that needs a little soft-warm friend and a light at the same time in bed before to get sleep :-)"
5,Great for years!,"I originally purchased this for my 2 month old son. However, my 3 year old quickly ""adopted"" it and moved it to the foot of his bed. He has had it now for almost 3 years and uses it every night to go to sleep. The lights are soft and it automatically shuts off. Absolutely worth the money!"
4,My toddler loves the Twilight Turtle,"When my daughter was an infant, Her crib mobile projected stars on the ceiling. She went to sleep with it on every night. When she got too old for the mobile, I looked for something to replace it. The turtle was great. It projects stars onto the ceiling. You have three different colors to choose from (white, blue and green). A simple push of a button turns it on and a slide swtich allows you to change the color. My daughter is now two and turns this on by herself every night.You do need to place this in the middle of the room to project on the entire ceiling. I have it on an ottoman in the middle of my daughters room."
2,Disappointing,"We had the same issues as others, it sucked down batteries and then shorted out. We would have lived with the fuzzy stars as our 17 month old daughter just liked the lights, but I won't be replacing it to have the same thing happen again."
5,Awesome Gift,"Bought 2 of these for my cousin's. They are between the ages of 6-9, both girls. Great for the bedtime routine!!!Keeps the kids in their own room while allowing a fun 30-45 minute relaxing light show of stars. This is a good gift when one isn't sure what to purchase. Kids can be so tough. Delivery was spot on, packaging and description was as shown."
5,For my son's new room,I bought this for my son after moving him out of the nursery & into his big boy room. He was nervous so I bought this to comfort him . I had previously bought one for my daughter and it worked wonders for her when she transitioned to her big girl room. Definitely recommend this little guy.
2,So sad..,"It is dull and blurry :( I'm going to try getting my friend some fresh batteries, but it was weak out of the box. I'm so unhappy with the lack of clarity. It was a gift and I thought it would be special, but instead it only works when it is like 2 AM and the room is completely darkened.EDIT: September 2011I was so wrong! This thing is great. The room just needs to be completely pitch black and raised from the ground. Beautiful. I retract my initial judgement."
4,Light Up Your child's life,"For our review, we choose the Twilight Turtle Nightlight. This is a wonderful choice for babies and even older children. He is an adorable little plush turtle with a hard shell. Kids can play with him by day, and at night he turns into something truly amazing. A night light that not only keeps all the scary monsters away, but turns your child's bedroom into a whole new world. The back of the turtle's shell has a star and moon pattern and when the light are out, that pattern is reflected on the wall or ceiling. You can choose between white, green and blue stars. My toddler was amazed by it, and even my older kids loved it.***I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review on my blog, New Age Mama***"
5,solved our scared of the dark issue,"my daughter is 4 and we have tried many nightlights, and even a few together still it was a struggle to get her just to turn off her overhead light. then we had to have on the hallway, and bathroom light on, and a fish nightlight, princess nightlight. now just her ladybug she loves the stars. maybe our electrick bill will go down."
5,lady Bug,My grand daughter loves this lady bug pillow. She never gets tired of seeing the stars on the ceiling at night
2,Not a full time night light,I bought this expecting to use it as a nightlight for my child. The light turns off automatically after 45 minutes and there is no way to set it to stay on all night. There is also no AC adapter provided which means you go through batteries quickly. If you are expecting a nightlight that casts stars on the ceiling and can plug in and stay on all night - this product is not it.
4,Cute light,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She really likes it and enjoys watching the stars and moon on the ceiling. I just wish it had an option to make it brighter.
2,Not So Great,"All of the reviews I read say that this is a great product. We received ours yesterday. I bought it to help sooth our 8 month old when we put her to bed to get her to fall asleep faster on her own. She has white walls and the colors didn't show up well at all, even when I placed it on her night stand. The stars were too dim for her to take any interest in it. I turned on the red light, it only lights up the shell (which is more than the other colors do) and put it in the crib with her. She watched the glowing ladybug for a few minutes. My husband moved it to our room and placed it on the dresser. We could see it a little better but some of the stars just looked like wedges. It would be a great product if the lights were brighter, had music and turned."
3,Great while it lasts.,"My boys really love their turtle. It was a fantastic night light. Unfortunately, the power of the lights dim over time and eventually go out. The light source is not replaceable, so we only got a year's use out of this product. If the price of the turtle (and the necessary batteries to operate it) seem worth a year's use, then I recommend. If, however, you believe the sticker price warrants a longer life, then you may want to consider alternative night lights."
5,Great toy,This turtle is much better than I expected. We first tried it in a room with high ceilings and it worked very well. It worked even better in a smaller room. The stars show up very clear on the ceiling and walls and the different colors are great.
5,great for bedtime,My daughter had been fighting bedtime because she was afraid of the dark even with a conventional night light. We go the lady bug; placed it in the center of the room on a clothes hamper to give it some height and it projects wonderfully on the ceiling. Green works the best but she likes all the colors. Bedtime is much easier now.
1,Poorly Made Disposable Turtle,"Our baby loved the turtle, until the lights began to fade. When we changed the battery the screw stripped, but we managed to open it by spinning the screw with a pair of pliers. The new batteries had NO EFFECT. It still doesn't work after changing them twice. We've had this for 7.5 months."
4,Great for my 1 & 4 year old,"This is a great night light for my girls, who share a room. I can put my 1- year-old to bed, and it stays on until I bring my 4-year-old up. She really loves it and says ""my stars"". The light level of the green and blue is perfect for their room--just enough light so I can see and so the older one can see the stars on the ceiling and walls. The amber is in fact very dim, though I don't mind it."
4,"OK, but...","I bought this for a finicky infant (3-5 mos.) who loves watching lights and ceiling fans and thought it would aid in putting her to sleep. It's inconvenient though, to find a place in the center of the room, close enough to the ceiling so that she looks at the stars as opposed to the turtle itself! All in all, I think she might appreciate it when she's older, because she still prefers the soft reflection from a beaded table lamp we have."
5,She Likes Going to Bed Now!,"Among what seems like a hundred gifts on her 2 year birthday, my daughter definitely loved this gift the most. The Ladybug transforms up her entire ceiling into a galaxy of kiddie stars. She loves laying on her floor with the lights off looking at the ""sky"" and even enjoys going to bed now - something which was historically always a negotiation.Based on the reviews, I heard some of the other animals didn't light up as ""full"". So I got the lady bug. My daughter also likes changing the colors - it changes 3 or 4 different ""galaxy"" colors. Well worth the $30."
5,Made a little girl feel safe!,"I purchased this product (Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle) for my girlfriend's daughter's third birthday. A few days later, I asked the little girl if she liked the turtle. She said she had been scared to sleep in her room before, but now the turtle makes her feel safe. Finally she is able to get a good night's sleep in her own room. I highly recommend this product."
5,LOVE IT!!,"I got this product for my daughter as a gift. I LOVE it. She will not be here until February, but I can't wait for her to begin enjoying it. I love that the lady bug has 3 different color options and the stars show up great! I plan to purchase another one of these for a friend that is having a baby."
3,"Great concept, shoddy product","I've bought a couple of Cloud B items and they always break too soon. I've gotten the star turtle twice. The first time it didnt work out of the box. this second time i went to change the batteries and it didnt work afterwards. We tried 2 sets of batteries. My son doesnt play with it, we use it on a table as a night light so its not from wear and tear. Now i have to get the same one again because he REALLY enjoys it."
4,Excellent,My son loves his new turtle. I wish it was darker at bedtime for him to enjoy it but I'm sure he will in the fall/winter. I also think there should be music. The turtle is a perfect night light. The turtle is soft and has a flap over the bottom to cover the battery cover. Fantastic idea!
5,Dream Light ladybug,"My son and daughter (ages 9 and 6) got these dream lights,(my son got the blue turtle) a couple of days ago. Of all the vacation presents this is their favorite. The Pink bug shines in 3 different colors; red, blue and green. To my amazement the display on the ceiling was very impressive. My daughter may be jet lagged, but she is excited about going to bed on time now. I'm very happy with the quality and price so far."
3,not the complete version,"this is only a simpler version of the cloub b night light. The complete version can sing and most important can turn, but this one can't. Don't worth the price."
5,An excellent birthday present!,"I had this item delivered to my granddaughter's home for her birthday. She reported that it arrived in good condition, she loves it and enjoys playing with it."
5,Second one I've bought!,Last February we bought the Twilight Turtle for my son's 2 year birthday. He absolutely loves it! My niece feel in love with it the last time she spent the night so we got the ladybug for her 4 year birthday this month. It was a big hit at her party and she was beyond excited. Definitely an awesome gift/nightlight to get your kids. They'll love it!!!
2,"Good idea, bad implementation","We were so excited to purchase this product as a nightlite and more. Out of the box the turtle seems very well made. The lights eminating from its back are quite bright. Herein lies the problem. It seems that in order to actually notice that the lights coming from its back are stars and to see all of the constellations, the turtle, according to recommendations, must be placed high on an object in the center of the room. Who has a dresser or something similar in the center of the room? Placing the turtle on the floor diminishes the stars so that the lights simply look like fuzzy indistinct shapes on the ceiling. Putting it on a dresser near the wall also doesn't work because the full constellations won't appear on the ceiling."
2,We are on our 3rd one...,I saw this and had to get it for my daughters room. Well she is 10 months now and we are on our third one...this is not a good thing. The first one we got shorted itself out and we tried to fix it but forget it...also we must have gotten an older version because the second I bought was awesome- was so much brighter and you could make out the stars. The second one did not last very long and this one sucked down batteries and again shorted out with in two months. We received one as a gift for christmas- which was fine...so far it's worked but still sucking down batteries. It's super cute and when the batteries aren't dying the light is perfect. Make sure you get a newer model if anything.
3,Cute but didn't last,"This turtle was bought for our daughter for Christmas when she was 1 year old. Initially, she wasn't interested in it so it sat on the dresser until she was a little over two and one day, asked to see it. From that point on, she LOVED to see her stars up on the ceiling at bedtime each night and wouldn't go to sleep without it. Unfortunately, it started acting up (wouldn't always turn on) after only a month or two of daily use, and after about 3 months, we couldn't get it to turn on at all. It was never used as a toy or abused, it stayed in her bed and was used only at night. It was cute while it lasted but wasn't worth $30 for a nightlight that only gave us about 3 months of use. She wants another one but we aren't sure if we want to spend the money again. Also, the stars are not crisp unless they are close to the ceiling, but that didn't seem to bother my 2 year old."
1,total waste of money!!,"Don't waste your money on this product. It looks cute but that is it, ours did not look like the one pictured the face was black not grey on both of them. It does not take aaa like it says on the box instead it takes AA It started falling apart the first day we got them. We bought them for our 6 year old twins for their bday. Within 2 days they broke completely and all they did was take them to bed with them and hold them at night. The red never showed up at night. Save your money and buy night lights and glow in the dark star stickers and put them on the ceiling. A word of advise from a very unhappy customer.."
5,Awesome!,"My son who will be 4 in May has been saying things about monsters in his room. He has autism so it's hard for him to tell me exactly what the problem is or what is scaring him. I wasn't sure if he was afraid of the dark or having nightmares. I decided to get this turtle and give it a try. He used it for the first time last night and then this morning he said to me ""No more."" I asked him ""No more what?"" He then told me ""No more monsters. No more dark."" AMAZING!!"
5,14 and loved it!,"I'm 14 years old and I loved this! It's really cool to see the stars in my room! When I have sleepovers, my friends fight over which color we get to sleep with...(The amber one doesn't work too well)"
5,love it!,i like this neat turtle and so does my 5 month old! i got it for my son for Chrsitmas and he enjoys looking at the stars!
4,Great - till it broke TWO times.,"Basically, it broke had to send it back, the other one lasted a few months, that broke too. Nice idea, but not quality product."
4,"Soft light, soft toy",Bought this for our new baby but all the kids love it!! Very happy with this purchase! Just wish it had music too.
4,Not what I expected,"I ordered this expecting to receive the color pictured, however it came in with a different colored body. It's a very dark brown whereas the picture shows a light colored head. I had ordered this for my granddaughter so I went ahead and gave it to her and she loves it!! I would have rated it higher had I received the one I thought I was ordering, but since my granddaughter is happy, I'm also happy with it."
5,Fantastic! My family owns two!,"Both of my kids have the Cloud B Twilight Constellation Night Light - one has the turtle and the other has the lady bug. They are great - they don't stay on all night to wake the kids up (there's an auto shut-off), but are there to help the kids fall asleep (or fall BACK to sleep if they wake up during the night). We've had the turtle for about 9 months - and have only had to replace the batteries once. Both of my kids just LOVE these - my older daughter is already planning on how she's going to bring hers to an upcoming trip to her Grandmother's."
5,Twilight Turtle,"Excellent product. I bought this for my six month old- at this point I get more enjoyment out if it, but I know that she will once she is a bit older. I turn the turtle on, put on some music and create the most calming environment."
4,Almost completely satisfied,"We love the turtle and the stars, but unless you have something to place the turtle on 4-6 feet from the ceiling in the center of the room, the constellation part isn't happening. Cool concept, though, and I'm sure my husband will find the constellations and teach them to our son somehow, but not like we thought when we bought the turtle. Would I still buy the turtle nightlight all over again? Absolutely!"
5,The Greatest Nightlight!!!,"After reading the reviews, both good and bad, I could not wait to get this product and when it came today I had to try it out. The stars are great. It is just a nightlight so if you are expecting something elaborate of the night sky...think again. It is hard over the shell and the rest of the body is plush, but it is not a toy. Just cute to look at. I think all of the light settings are great. Blue is the brightest and amber is the dimmest, but they all look great in a dark room. If you want a fancy nightlight...go for it! Worth all the money"
2,TOO Loud!!,"I purchased this Cloud B Twilight Turtle for my 3 month old and 3 yr old nieces. The stars are okay but the ""soothing"" music is anything but soothing. The ear piercing music was was so loud you could not hear someone talking that is standing right next to you. I have looked it all over hoping that there was a volume control but there wasn't. We tried to take it apart to put a ""muffle"" over the speaker but there isn't a way to take it apart without breaking it. MAYBE I got a defective one but I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend this product."
5,Family Favorite!,"I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas. When it arrived, I took it into a dark room to try it out. I was instantly in love with it! Christmas morning, we had the entire family crammed into the dark bathroom oohing and aahing over this awesome product! It is advertised for very small children, but I can tell you that people of all ages would love to have this addition to their bedroom!"
5,The stars and moon are on your ceiling!,The stars and a quarter moon are cast on your child's ceiling in his choice of three different colors. The turtle is adorable on his own!
5,"I was skeptical,but my daughter wanted me to get it for her son. He loves it and falls to sleep very quickly.",My grandson loves it. He is eighteen months old and doesn't like the dark. He falls asleep very quickly with this.The other product on the market looks like it would scare a young child. This was great.
4,turtle cloud projection,Fun to sleep with; 4 year old enjoys at night. No tips or guidelines needed. Maybe a pillow close by since it is not a pillow.
4,Twilight Turtle,Very cute. Purchased for my neices first birthday. Loved by her and her two older sisters.
3,Helped my daughter overcome her fear of the dark.,"I purchased this for my daughter when she was 4 to help her overcome her fear of the dark. She loved it and would not sleep without it in the beginning. Now she is 5 and we've had it for 8 months. She no longer sleeps with, nor needs it. The defect in this product is what got her to transition to the dark. Here is how it happened... At first it worked perfectly for the first 6 months. By the 7th month only the amber worked, which is the lightest color, so she could only use that. By the 8th month, the amber was so light she may as well had not even turned on the turtle, so she didn't. She now sleeps without it and without complaint. She is also no longer afraid of the dark. It served it's purpose, but not the way it was intended to. All in all, I am grateful for the toy, but it is definitely not durable."
5,Adorable,"I haven't given this to my daughter yet because it is for her 5th birthday next month but I tried it out. It casts so many stars onto the ceiling. It actually surprised me that it covered the whole ceiling of my bedroom (my bedroom is pretty big). I guess I just imagined it would project enough to cover a small section of the ceiling. My 2 year old son was in the room when I tested it out and he was amazed by all the stars as well. He was mad when I had to put it away. Guess he's getting a turtle version of this for Christmas. The ladybug is also adorable. I saw that some of the customer pictures featured one with closed eyes but in the main picture her eyes were open. Mine arrived with her eyes open and I was pretty pleased about that. I think she's cuter that way. Anyway, I think my daughter is going to love it. If not, I'm giving it to my son. :)"
4,The Cloud B Twilight Ladybug is fantastic!,ON the box it says its for 3 years and up but my 6month old goes to bed with ease when I turn on the twilight ladybug he cant stop looking at the ceiling and walls!
5,Lady bug night light,My 4 year old grandaughter loves this ladybug nightlight. She has to have it on her bed every night. Really neat how it shows the stars and moon on the ceiling of her room. It automatically turns off after about 45 minutes so doesn't stay on all night and run the batteries down. I order from Amazon as Christmas present and they had it delivered in just a few days.
4,Great product,"I bought this because my two year old son is putting up a fight at bedtime. He loves it, and it calms him down because we have to turn out the lights and he has to sit calmly to observe the stars. I gave this a four stars because I wish the projections would move and/or the turtle would play soft music then it would definitely be worth the money. It's still a good buy though."
4,So cute,"My 2 1/2 year old and 8 month old kids love this turtle. I like that it helps them feel okay about being in the dark, my son actually wants the lights off so he can look at the stars. It's also nice that there are three different colors to change the light to, and it shuts off on it's own after awhile."
4,Perfect gift for a 4 year old!,"My 4 year old niece absolutely loves her turtle night light...and the best part, even after a year it still sits right on her bed! She uses it every night and loves counting the stars on the ceiling to sleep. Great battery life, super easy to use and has 3 different color settings."
5,Sure Thing,"Each of my three year old nieces got one of these Night Lights when they were born. They now put them in the bed with them. Still loving the stars. My newest niece is only 6 months, but she is also fascinated by the light show. Well made, cute and popular. Very good choice for a newborn or later."
4,So cute but horrible battery life,"I was so excited when I found a pink animal night light for my daughter's room and she loves it! I have had this for 45 days and the battery has already died several times. When you replace it, they never last more than a couple of days. It is a great product but make sure that you have a surplus of batteries on hand because of course you never realize that it is dying again until you turn it on for bedtime. My daughter will not go to sleep without it. It is very cute and durable and I would absolutely recommend this product just be aware of the one major downfall."
4,better than a dream light,after seeing the dream light commercials over and over and over...my 3 year old had to have one. We got the Cloud B instead because the stars stay on for a longer amount of time (45 minutes).our kid loves it!
5,Awesome,I purchased this for my 2 granddaughters who just love it. At night they turn it onand watch the starts on the ceiling and before you know it they are sound asleep andthe light turns off and everyone is at peace. Great investment and would recommend it highly.
3,Cute and fun but doesn't last,"This product is fantastic except for a few things:1. The batteries get eaten up quickly, especially if it's used as a nightlight. The batteries ran out half way through the night and I was not going to put fresh ones in each night!2. The buttons are flimsy. One of ours broke off when the turtle was being played with.So, if you want to have a planetarium on your kids' ceiling at night for a few minutes, it's great. If you want to use it as a nightlight, it's not great."
5,Greatest night lite ever!!!,"Cloud B Twilight Ladybugi bought this for our Grandson and he is wild about it. He is 2 1/2 and they recently moved into a new home where he has his own room,so it really helps at night. He loves it and will not go to bed without it."
5,Cloud b Twilight Turtle,I purchased this night light for my 3 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it. She can easily turn it on or off from her bed even though it has a timer. The stars look very nice even though we do not have the light centered in the room. We haven't looked for the constellations yet but will do so in the future. Would suggest to a friend to purchase.
4,Great Night Light!,Love this night light! My son loves to look at the stars and the moon while calming down to sleep. The only con is that the turtle stops working if dropped on a hard surface. This is our 3rd one.
4,Lady bug night light cloud b,"My daughter loves her lady bug! She is 4yrs old now. We have had it for a yr now and are ready for another one as the buttons are starting to sink in and stick. It sits at the foot of her Full size bed and stars glow on her entire ceiling. We use the blue and green. It's so pretty. It was very frustrating in the beginning to find that it shuts off after 45 min. My daughter would cry in the dark and we'd have to go in and turn it back on. I solved that problem by purchasing a homedics alarm clock/sound machine combo! Wheeee! The light on the clock is so bright it acts as a night light so when the stars on the ladybug turn off in her room her ""night light"" clock is still on. We have an 18 mth old son who just loves the starts too. So when he gets into a big boy bed we will get him the turtle. He is such a good sleeper that i don't want to mess with our routine by putting a distraction like this in his room. LOVE THESE!!!!!"
4,best night light,"I loved this cute little turle, it has been one of the best night lights I tried in my girls room. I love the diffrent colors it offers.The girls favorite color is the purple glow. Its perfect. The only thing negative thing I have to say about it is that I wish it had was some music of some kind. Other than that its the best night light I have tried out."
5,My son loves it!,My son really loves the Twilight Turtle. We just bought it and he is 21 months old...wish I had seen this earlier on. He loves looking up to see all the stars...he walks around the house during the day looking up for them. Sometimes he'll just sit with the turtle & change the lights to see the different colors on the ceiling. We definately recommend this item.
3,cute but expensive,Lets just say the advertisement is decieving.No the stars are not bright and are rather small. I think it is an over priced nite lite.It is however cute and will help lil ones in the dark but thats about it.
4,Amber Alert,"This is a fun awesome nightlight, however the amber color is completely useless. You would think someone would have tested this before it was put into production. The other colors are really neat though so not a total waste. Would buy again."
1,NOT CLOUD B PRODUCT,"When I received this item I was disappointed to find that it was not a Cloud B product as advertised. It is a replicate product, on the box it states it is made by Merry. Amazon is sending me correct product - do not waste time/money ordering this product."
2,NOT worth the money,"if this thing cost like $10 i would still be dissapointed, but paying over $30 or $40 for it is just silly. try to buy it used, or wait til they improve it. you have to find somewhere to put it where nothing blocks its light path, which is hard in a small baby room like mine. it's good for doody if you have a textured ceiling, even slightly. and as someone else said, the ""amber"" is barely visible. I bought it a week ago, and have even tried just turning the lights off and playing with my 9-month-old with it -- so basically i just bought him a really expensive toy. wish i hadn't bought it online -- i'd return it."
4,Lady Bug Cloud Night light,My girls love this product and it looks great in their room. The purple and green show up great the red is a little hard to see so it maybe based on room colors. Overall the product is great and easy for the kids to turn on and pick colors they sleep with it everynight and love it!
4,Simply adorable!,I LOVE this product. I purchased quite a few different night lights for my daughters and this one is the BEST! The purple light is the best. The stars are bright and you can see them all over the room. There is a timer that will shut it off after 30 minutes but it's easy enough for both my 4 and 2 year old to turn it back on again.I spent more money on other night lights that weren't as good as this one and I wish I found this one first.
5,Best Night Light Ever,"My daughter got two of these for my grandson. One was the ladybug and the other I believe was the turtle. They are fantastic. They shine all over the room without being blinded by it. You can actually stare into the holes and it will not hurt your eyes...I don't know how they do it. It also shines on a high ceiling of 25 ft up to the top without a problem, well worth the money."
3,Not as great !,I bought it since I am morally against ferberizing kids and our 8 month old son had still not learned to sleep by himself .. though its very nice product by itself our expectation from it probably were unrealistic so want to caution parents who might be in the same boat .. infants would like the stars studded ceiling but after a while they get used to it and don't find it as fascinating .. our son likes it but its not enough to make him sleep while star gazing .. if the stars could rotate slightly that might have done the trick but with the still appearance its just not enough .. YMMV.
3,Would be better with motion,"This product is okay but would be MUCH better if it had some motion to it, even an occasional shooting star or twinkling star would be an improvement."
5,Cool night light,"My daughter, age 5, wanted one of the dream lights. I had seen these way before the Dream lights even came out & knew this would be a much better product. Not to mention that almost everywhere I checked for reviews on the Dream lights they were rated poorly. Cloud B & their products have very good ratings & now I know why. Very cute, light can be changed to 4 different colors, there is an off switch, and there are actual constellations projected on the ceiling. Love this product! would recommend to anyone, with or with out kids!"
4,Great!,"My 5 month old loves this. The auburn color is kind of dull in a dark room, but the Blue and Green sure do stand out! They are very bright. We turn off all the lights and turn on our little Turtle and my son seems to be in awe. His Grandmother plans to buy 2. One for her self and one for her other grandson. Wish I had one when I was a kid."
2,Best gift i ever gave.,"Gf, loves turtles and has fear of the dark,WIN/WIN for me. love this item.might by 2.EDIT: Light burned out very fast. Manufact refused to help in any way.now we have a sad face all the time."
4,We enjoy,My wife is from Thailand and her nickname is Dow which means star in Thai. We both enjoy the stars on our celling.
1,broke within a year,"This started off as a great product. But after a year, it broke. I didn't think I could return it, but come to fin out I could have within the year. :( I thought it was only 30 days. But, the concept is great, just bummed I payed $25 and it busted after a year."
5,fan of it,"Cloud B Twlilight became an instant hit at our home esp with kids. Its easy to get kids to bed. My nieces change colors, count the stars and play along making the night fun and memorable."
5,Makes for perfect good nights,"I bought the Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light Turtle for her 2nd Christmas, when she was 18 months old. It has been on her dresser since then, and every night she will tell me she would like ""blue stars"" or ""green stars""...the amber stars are a little dim and create much light for her. It is the perfect way to tuck her into bed every night. She has loved and adored it, and we take it along to Granny's house when we visit. It's nice to bring something from home to help you sleep. It recently stopped working, but after almost five years, I feel like we got our money's worth. She might even get a new one for Christmas."
4,Love this turtle!,"I bought this for my 5 year old who was suddenly afraid of the dark, even with a night light. He loves the stars, and we always look for the moon when I put him to bed. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the yellow light is useless (stars are extremely faint). Otherwise, we love it. It stays on for 45 minutes, and by then, my son is already asleep. He brought it to show and tell and his class loved it. I was afraid of it getting broken, but my 2 year old has stepped on it and it didn't break (not that I would recommend a 2 year old play with it). It's definitely worth the money."
2,Great while it works,"It's a nicely designed product, and the finish is good too, but after about a year the light stopped working. Probably a burned out bulb, but since you can't open up the shell to change it, it's now lost it's charm. A product that with better planning could have lasted years and years is in reality designed to be disposable. That's a shame.Until that flaw is fixed, I wouldn't buy one. I know I won't buy another one."
4,Great nightlight!!!,"My husband and I actually bought the turtle for our baby who is in my tumy right now, but we are using now for ourselves hehe. It sits on a chair in our bedroom - we turn it on every night before bed."
5,must buy for infants and toddlers,"my daughter is 11 month old. she absolutely loved this lady bug night light. now when its dark, lady bug is turned on, she knows its time to sleep. she was very excited when we turned on lady bug the very 1st time. my daughter stood up on bed and was trying to toch to stars on cealing.... you'll not regret buying this product!"
4,i recieved this item in lightening speed awsome turtle!!!!!!,"I ordered the item and recieved it the next day morning, and in perfect shape that's an A+++ for the company.The turtle came in 3 different lights and it project starts and moon on the cieling. It gives you a very calm sleep at night. I bought this as a gift for my girl friend and she likes it a lot, and i'm sure this is the perfect night light for your childrend too."
4,Nice,"A little overpriced- only reason I took away a star. Otherwise, my 4-year-old daughter loves picking a color scheme for her ""starry night"" every night."
4,great little turtle,"This little turtle is great for our one 10 week old child. We turn the turtle on at bedtime and he just can't keep his eyes off all the stars around the room. Blue stars show up best, green a close second and the amber stars are a little fainter. I think it all depends on your paint color on your walls and the amount of ambient light in the room. Good option to have 3 colors, one will fit your decor. 45 minute glow time is good, plenty of time to get to sleep. Great buy, use every night."
4,The children loved it,"My children just loved it, even my 6 year old son! I would just mentionned that the light doen't last long enough. Very reasonnable price on the market."
1,So cute...but not worth the money!,"We got each of our toddlers one of these for Christmas. One turtle and one ladybug. One of the colors on the turtle went out the 2nd night and we returned it and got a replacement. It's been working ok so far. But then last night, 2 of the colors on the ladybug stopped working. We haven't even had it 60 days!! I wrote the company and they said the LED lights should last up to 3,000 hours...but they don't and you can't replace them. I can understand one bad egg but two? I'm sad because my kids love those and they are so cute...but they're turning out to be a total waste of money..."
5,one happy mom!,"My 2 yr old granddughter was going thru a monster phase at night, and my daughter was at her wits end over bedtime. So i hit amzon and started searching for ananswer. The same day the ladybug arrived, i took it to my daughters hosuse and explained to my granddaughter that monsters are afraid of the stars and moons. Not a single bad night since! My daughter called to thank me the very next night, and has thanked me more since."
1,The item was scratched in multiple places. Batteries inside the item was corroded and a part was broken off battery opening,I found this item to be inadequate. The item had multiple scratches. The battery casing had batteries in it which were corroded and the casing had a part broken off.This item was not of the standards of what I have ordered from Amazon in the past.
1,Smelly and not a Cloud B,"The lights look really cool, but the product had an odor I just couldn't live with and it is not a Cloud B Twlight Turtle as you're led to believe."
5,Very cute and soothing(Even fo adults),"Hello ,this is a great gift for children or adults. I actually got this formyself , because sometimes ill admit it i even still hate the dark. So i got this and it is so perfect. The stars show up so nice . I love the color functions , the amber is nice and gold shows upwell and blue is so tranquill >I wish i had this when i was little.But i have it now .Peace"
4,Great,"We have white walls but blackout curtains. The blue and green lights are much too bright to fall asleep by; however, the amber is perfect."
1,Evil Turtle beats hare,"Ugh. I feel prey to the same scam as many other buyers. I received a cheap knock-off that broke in a month after light use. I didn't even realize I got scammed until I read the reviews here after mine broke and saw that mine isn't Cloud B. I expect this from eBay, but not Amazon. I'll buy this thing in person @ Target."
2,OK - not for use with high ceilings,"We have 12+ foot high ceilings and nothing shows up. You have to have 8 foot ceiling, and then it will work best if it's on a dresser or something high. It does look neat when you can see it - just didn't work for us."
3,Expensive for what it is,"My daughter loves the Twilight Turtle, but I was a little disappointed when I received it. It is much smaller and cheaper looking than advertised. The lights aren't as strong as they could be and the orange is very hard to see on the ceiling. A more reasonable price would have been around $20-$25...for what you get--over $30 was too much money. Having said that, my 2 year old sleeps with it every night and really enjoys looking at the stars all over her bed, ceiling and pajamas!"
1,Poor Quality-fell apart,"My son has a Twilight Turtle that completely fell apart after very little use. The turtle body separated from the shell. It looks as if defective glue was used. I contacted Cloud b and I was rudely told that I had a counterfeit product. After sending pictures, customer service told me that it was a true Cloud b product but that it was out of warranty so I was out of luck. The woman I dealt with was rude from the start and obviously had no intention of standing by their product. I do not recommend buying this product as it is very cheaply made and a waste of money. Summer Infant makes a similar product that is less expensive, better quality, and has more features."
4,Great at Night,"I bought this product for my son after reading the great reviews.The product is well made and quite cute. I liked the booklet which accompanies it. The story is cute.I was a little disappointed in the blurry effects of the stars on the ceiling. The chart that accompanies the turtle, doesn't really help in identifying the stars.What is cool about this product is that it is a cool night light for my son. He enjoys looking at the stars, blurry as they are, when he doesn't fall asleep right away.When he was sleeping in the same room as my husband and I, our room would be softly illuminated, but not to that point of not being able to sleep.I am pleased with the product, as it is cute. I was however, disappointed with the amber lights as they are not visible. The blue and green are cool."
4,Best nighttime toy ever!,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the amber color isn't that great. We have 1 turtle for each of our daughters, ages 6 and 3, and they both love it. They like to set it on their beds and sleep with it near their feet. Get it, you shouldn't be disapointed."
3,Batteries Exploded,"This was a nice gift to buy my son for christmas, however I purchased this product 1 month before Christmas not aware of the exploded battery that was in the turtle. Fortunatley the turtle still works and the exploded battery didn't ruin the electronic components. I would recommend to make sure this doesn't happen to you when purchasing this item. Otherwise I like the turtle itself it's a very nice night light!"
3,lady bug,Need to be in a very dark room to see the lights but my daughter enjoys it so I guess its ok.
5,Love it!,We had the Twilight Sea Turtle for my son so we got this for my daughter as she was always jealous. Works great and she loves it! It was a little smaller than I thought it would be but I wouldn't buy a different one. Both this and the sea turtle are great. Hopefully it lasts a long time.
3,"Great, but buy a softer one...","These dream lights are great, but get one that is a bit softer, like the puppy. This one has too much plastic."
1,Disappointed,Just received it today. My son loves it when he saw it but after just a few seconds the light turned off. Not even a minute. We changed the battery but it's not working. Sooo disappointed. My 3 year old son said to throw it to trash. I've been a very satisfied amazon customer before until this thing happened. So sad.
3,Its small for the price.,I really loved this when i seen it and just had to have it . I guess i got excited and forgot to look at the size of it and when i got it in the mail it was smaller than what i had expected.The shell would fit on a piece of notebook paper (roughly) . Just wish it was bigger. Still love the look and idea of it.
3,"Cheaply built, overpriced, daughter loves it","First off, the positive- our daughter loves this thing- a key component of her ""settling down and falling asleep"" process. It makes a great night light and goes off by itself after awhile. She can identify one or two constellations, but don't expect much in that regard. It mainly looks like a bunch of stars on the ceiling and walls. Orange isn't very useful and quit working shortly after we started using it. She likes green the best.But it gave out after two changes of batteries. After putting in the third set, it just wouldn't turn on anymore. I guess I expect better for the price. It should last longer. I'll leave it up to readers of this review to decide whether that expectation is reasonable or not.."
3,Would be 5 stars if I could change the batteries.,"We bought this for our infant and he loves to watch the lights. After three months the batteries died and the screws were in so tight we could not replace the batteries. We will probably buy another, but I feel like there should be a way to keep children out of the battery compartment and still allow parental access."
5,This is wonderful!,"Bought this for my 6 year old daughter who has trouble falling to sleep. Lights up the room just right, ans my daughter is now excited to crawl into bed with her ladybug! I recommend this to everyone with youngsters in the house."
1,received a broken one!,"Not only is the plastic shell scratched up to the point of some color loss, the toy night light does not work. I replaced the batteries with a fresh set and still no avail. we are very disappointed."
3,Could use some music,"The stars project on the ceiling much larger than I expected. It would also be wonderful if it played some type of soothing music, waves, etc."
5,I can't say enough how much we love this!,"My little girl loves all the different colors, she even loves to hold the turtle, we even purchased the lady bug because she loved it so much."
2,has to be in a HIGH place to work,Gorgeous stars if you don't mind standing and holding it up head height... for...ever. :D It's really pretty but at a lower height it's washed out.
5,My daughter loves this night light,I absolutely love this item and would recommend it to all parents. My daughter loves to see all of the stars lining her wall and the fact that the light changes colour. My only disappointment is that the light does not last the whole night so that when my daughter wakes during the night her room is in darkness. However other than that I am very impressed with this item and it shipped very quickly
5,Great Product at a Great Price,"My grandaughter wanted one of the dream lights she sees advertised on TV. I am so happy I did some research prior to buying one! This has a much longer automatic shutoff time (which after all isn't that what you want to help a 4 year old fall sleep). It works very well and is very sturdy. Although she wanted the Unicorn Dreamlight she is so excited with ""Tommy Turtle"" it goes with her regardless of which bedroom she is in after dark. Less expensive than the those advertised on TV as well. All around a great product. We are planning on buying several more for family and her friends for Christmas."
5,OK for big kids too,"My son is 10 years old and loves this nightlight. It is not that he is afraid of the dark; he is a social person that doesn't like to be alone. This helps him relax and go to sleep. He likes that he can select the color for his mood and that it turns off when it is done. His previous ""nightlight"" only put stars on the ceiling. He loves that the stars are on the walls now too."
5,Buy this for your child!,"I bought this for both my son and a good friends of mines young son for Christmas. What a hit! We both have joked about getting one for ourselves to put in our own rooms.The projections are beautiful and I love how compact and adorable the turtle is.My only complaint would be that the yellow color option is VERY dull, even in the darkest room, it can barely be seen. I keep mine set on blue.If your child needs the comfort of a night light, or if you looking for something to soothe before bed, this product is for you."
4,starry night lite,My daughter loves lady bugs. This item is durable (she's dropped it several times already) and very cute. 3 different hues light her starry sky and keep her occupied until she falls asleep!
4,Cute,"Very cute. When sitting on a night table or dresser, the stars are actually pretty big and cartoon-like on the ceiling (about the size of a quarter or maybe a little bigger) instead of being small pinpoints of light, but that's fine. It's nice that it is battery powered and you don't have to plug it in. It's also nice to have a choice of colors."
5,ladybug constellation light,The ladybug constellation light was a big hit Christmas morning. My two year old granddaughter absolutely loved it as did her parents. This light could be for a baby gift or anyone who enjoys the stars right up to and through adults. Had a great experience with Amazon and will shop here often.
4,dreamlite on a budget..,"I purchased this for christmas as well as a butterfly dreamlight. By comparison, this one has four buttons for color selection, dreamlite has one. They both turn off automatically. My 3 year old loves this and her 6 year old sister can't tell the difference. It's a great product."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this item for my granddaughter for x-mas, it worked for a few minutes then the batteries died. Once we replaced the batteries, the result was the same. It worked for a few minutes then died again!!! Sooo Very Disappointed by this product especially since it was for x-mas that I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Great toddler stay in be tool!,"Very cute and functional night light. This was a wonderful tool for transitioning our twin toddlers from their cribs to their toddler beds. After tucking them in, we'd give them each a turtle light. They were fascinated and played with them in bed until falling asleep. It is also nice to know that they each have a light that they can control should they need one during the night.The only disappointment was the color of the fabric. It is much greener than it appears in the picture. It is not unpleasant, just different from my expectations. Overall, this is a very nice light for your child."
3,It's cute,"I originally purchased this item for a special needs child with thoughts that the stars would provide some visual and sensory stimulation and ended up adding an additional one on my order for my 1 year old son. I agree with the comment that it's an expensive nightlight- with a little flair. We use it every night during our bedtime routine and my son likes to point to the ""lights"". I am a little disappointed that the bulb cannot be changed but we are enjoying it while it works. We see the blue and green colors with no problem, even if the room isn't totally dark. The yellow stars are a little hard to see but I prefer the blue and green colors anyway."
5,Kids love it,"Was a little unimpressed with the power of the lights at first, but once you get it into a dark room at night, it's very neat. The kids totally love to play with it and it's durable enough to allow them to."
4,pretty stinkin' cool,"this thing is pretty cool. my 14th month old loves to lay and look at the stars. the only complaint i have is that i can't figure out how to turn off the ""optional"" 45 minute sleep timer. it's definitely worth buying."
3,HR's Mommy,"I purchased this item and when I received it in the mail, the blue light didn't work. Therefore, I had to contact Amazon and have it reshipped and then send back the old turtle. The return process was pretty speedy, but I was a little dissappointed that it didn't work in the first place. Also, the stars display nicely on the ceiling if you are holding the turtle a couple feet directly under it. Otherwise, the stars get a little burry and aren't in the babies exact eyesight. Which makes my husband and I wonder how we're supposed to display the turtle exactly. (?)"
5,Great gift,"This is the second purchase I made of this item. I purchased this for my nephew for Christmas when he was 1. Now at three he loves going to sleep with the stars every night. The second one I purchased as a baby gift as the green and blue colors provide enough light in the room to change a diaper etc during the night with the touch of a button, and I believe the baby can defintely grow into it. The amber colored stars are on the lighter or fainter side, but this is truely a beautiful gift."
4,Puts My Son to Sleep - Enough Said,"Yes, the turtle has some shortcomings in terms of technological perfection and Turtle 2.0 may be on the way, but this one helps my son go to sleep, night after night. My two year old turns teh turtle on himself, changes the colors and likes to snuggle with him."
4,Good product for babies and toddlers.,"My little one liked it very much. I got it for her, when she was 1.5 years old. It's bright, but not too much that it will mess up your sleep. All the colors are well lit. Overall a nice product. Just feels a bit flimsy. So I gave it 4 stars."
2,not worth it,"The idea is neat and most reviews here are very positive so I was prepared to tolerate some minors like dim amber color when ordering.The turtle came from Amazon nicely, and is cute (though not elegantly made). The blue/green are good enough to project, however to me, the ""stars"" on the ceiling are fussy and less effective. If you also plan to use the turtle for constellation education, just forget about it. After several tries the turtle was put in hibernate mode.I wish cloud B could make some improvements like projecting sharp twinkling stars with some background music."
4,this is so cute,i would give this 5 stars but there are some things that need to be fixed. i wish the light was brighter and it could hold more battery's
5,Impressed,"I'm very impressed with the Cloud b Twilight turtle, the stars are more visible than I had first imagined. It makes a great night light for any child's room. All colors show up great. My only complaint is that I wish the turtle stuck out a little further from the shell, especially the back legs. Overall, great product and we definitely recommend it!"
2,Sadly Disappointed,"I thought this item was so cute and the pictures that were displayed showed the stars projecting clearly on the ceiling in three different colors. However when I got it, It seemed to only partially work. The stars displayed on the ceiling but not very clear and the three colors.... well those only lasted one night. We would turn the light on and when we pushed to see another color it shut the whole thing off. My daughter is young and doesn't know the difference. She is happy to see the red stars on her wall when she holds it right next to the wall. I wanted something that could project a scenery on her ceiling to help her sleep and this just wasn't what I expected."
1,Shiny stars not so shiny,"I bought this for my 2 year old based on the reviews. Thought it would calm her and help her fall asleep. Tried it out the first night I received it and could barely see anything on the ceiling or walls. Wondering what I was doing wrong, I read the directions which indicated that it should be placed in the center of the room, half way between the floor and the ceiling. Are you kidding me?! Like I am going to place a table in the middle of my daughters room for the light up lady bug! Not! Perhaps the positive reviews were based on a different version."
1,Ours broke which is very dissapointing!!,This ladybug has served us well unfortunately for a very short time. We got this for our baby at christmas. Around march it stopped showing the green and blue lights. It only works on red and the button sticks. We have tried changing the batteries but that isnt the problem. Its unfortunate because this is a great idea and great product but the quality just isnt there. If you get one that works that is great because you will love it!!
2,Great Product While It Lasted,"We received the twilight turtle constellation nightlight at the beginning of September 2008 and it was wonderful. My two 1/2 year old son was thrilled. We used it every night. Unfortunately in December 2008 it just stopped working. I replaced the batteries (with 4 new sets of batteries, just in case) and even tried to look inside unfortunately you can't reach anything unless you rip the turtle part out. I tried contacting both customer service departments, but no response. My son is extremely disappointed and so am I."
2,"Good idea, poor construction","While the Constellation turtle is a cute idea, it is poorly made. The white lights are useless, but the blue and green work great. This is more of a night light, as the name states, not a learning toy, people planning to teach their children about the constellations should look elsewhere. Our turtle came unglued at the neck, around the plastic and the fabric and the stuffing started coming out. This item is recommended for children age 3 and up, it falls apart and the stuffing falls out it can be a choking hazard!"
3,Great for ages 12 months and up,My son was given the Cloud b Twilight Turtle for his first birthday. He just loves it. He can turn on and off the constellation. Plus it's soft and easy for him to carry around!
1,Made in China = piece of junk,"This is a piece of junk. The battery compartment door does not even open. And my package did not come with 3 AAA batteries, contrary to what the product description says. I was swayed by the hundreds of positive reviews, but I didn't even get a chance to try this turtle. I'm returning it. I'm glad Amazon is providing free return shipping. My baby will have to fall asleep without this. These sleep aid toys are just a crutch anyway. I might get some glow in the dark stars instead. Much cheaper, no batteries required, and takes up less space. Plus since the turtle's stars don't even move, there is no difference in functionality either. Parents, save your money and avoid this product."
5,My granddaughter loves it!,"When I come for a visit, I share a room with my granddaughter. I couldn't sleep with the glaring wall nightlight she had and she'd cry if I turned it off, so I needed a solution.I was so happy when the Cloud b constellation nightlight arrived and I could actually see that it was soft and just bright enough that my granddaughter was able to fall asleep, and not so bright that it kept me awake. Now she falls asleep hugging it across her chest. She loves that she can choose the light color and that 45 minute timer saves on batteries. The added bonus was that it mimics actual constellations and the little book it comes with explains them. Functional and educational. I've seen similar toys at Wal-Mart, but these by far are so much better! There is something so soothing about watching the stars before falling asleep.On my next visit, I asked my granddaughter if she liked her new nightlight. She said, ""Grandma, I LOVE it!"" That's good enough for me."
3,Great until it stops working... which it will,"We purchased this nite-light for our daughter's nursery and she loves to look at the stars as we rock her to sleep. Very calming and soothing. The problem is that the LED lights die quickly, and are non-replaceable. We've gone through three units in under 1 year and have decided enough is enough. The first lasted about 4-5 months, the second lasted 2-3 months and the third (which was comp'd by AMAZON) has already begun to die after 2 months. It's really unfortunate as it's great while it works... and is useless when it doesn't. There are other similar products on the market, and we'll be trying those next for sure."
3,o.k.,"it was a little less than i expected. it needs to be really close to the ceiling to show stars. it just looks like faint light blobs. i can barely make out constellations, but i suppose it's alright. baby becuase had great shipping time though and i am pleased with them."
1,COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT WHEN PURCHASED FROM CEON GROUP!,"Hi, This product is **fraudulent**. I own another genuine CLOUD B turtle(purchased directly from amazon) with which I am thrilled, so i purchased this one as a gift. this one is a completeely inferior poor quality counterfeit, with no tag and/or manufacturer information at all. And this is a product for **babies!!** God knows what else is in there (lead? cadmium?, defective batteries leaking acid?) I am a frequent amazon customer, generally very satisfied w/the experience. This is the first time I've had this sort of issue. Really freaked out by it."
3,"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Lady Bug",Very entertaining for an 18 month old little girl. Lovely lights on ceiling and walls of bedroom while little one drops off to sleep.
2,Doesn't turn on.,"I purchased this as a gift for my 6 year old. He opened it in the afternoon and put it aside until bedtime on Christmas night. He ran down to grab his turtle at bedtime and it didn't turn on. We even tried replacing the batteries that came with it and...nothing. A very disappointed little guy on a special night. I went to process the return on amazon and it told me they'd replace it for free with shipment due in over a MONTH! Unacceptable. I'm sure it's adorable when it works. So far, not so happy.Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle"
4,Adorable!,My daughter was 16 months when we first received this toy so she was old enough to understand it! She loved it!! I would leave it on in her room at bedtime and she would choose the color of stars!! She did out grow it by 21 months and would shut it off immediately after I left the room but I do think she would of enjoyed it more at an earlier age!
4,Arrived in time for Christmas,I ordered this item for a co-worker who just had a baby. Item arrived on time and packaged very carefully. Based on the reviews I don't think it will be a disappointment to whoever owns it.
3,Awesome... at first.,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday in October. It REALLY is a neat night light. I thought the constellations were well done and my daughter really loves it. In fact, she wont sleep without it on.After about a month or so, it started going through batteries rather quickly... I was having to change them out every other week or so. Then by February, the inner light bulb burned out and there is no replacement. It is completely dead. I would expect that it would last longer than four months, especially since it turns itself off after about 20 minutes.. I would also expect that the lights inside be replaceable. Once they die, you have to buy a new one."
3,broken? Tried new battery? Use OLD battery!,"I bought this 90 days ago (I know, exactly the length of warranty ). The lights are now dimmer, I decide to replace the battery. Guess what, turtle won't light up with 3 brand new AAA. I test each with a battery tester. They are fine, and I am puzzled. I put the old batteries back in. The turtle lights up, dimly.I pull out my multi-meter, the old batteries (3 of them) measures 3 volts. So I grab another half used battery, and put it in along 2 of the OLD ones. Guess what? The turtle is bright again!So take it from me, a befuddled father, use half run down batteries for this night light. It seems to demand a voltage of 3v or slightly above. With 3 brand new AAA, 4.5v or more is too much for this baby. If you only have brand new ones, use only 2, and use a metal paper clip to bridge the last battery slot. It works. I tried."
1,Appears to be an original but did not last.,"Unlike others, the unit received from Amazon appears to have all the markings of 'Cloud b' but the first (red) light failed after only a few uses. The unit is made in China. Based on other reviews (on Amazon and elsewhere) this appears to be a chronic problem. We really like the idea of the product but the company has a quality control problem. I would avoid the item and seek something else of higher quality (odds may improve by looking for a product from somewhere else besides mainland China)."
5,Love the Cloud b Constellation Nightlights!,I absolutely love these nightlights! My daughter got one as a gift a while back and since then it's become my standard baby gift. Your kids will love these even more as they get older. My daughter is 5 now and she loves to fall asleep to the stars!
4,"Really good, could be better.","It would be nice if the stars rotated and the toy played a lullaby, but the kids love it, they like to play ""find the moon"" before they go to sleep."
4,"Great ""Toy""","I bought one of these for my son when he was a few months old. He is now two, and we just had to replace the original one we bought. It just stopped working, after multiple battery changes and all.I don't know how long these are supposed to last, but I thought two years was pretty good... Especially with a baby who played with it all of the time because he like it so much.Now that he is two, he enjoys pointing out the moon and stars on his ceiling. He can sleep without it, but he really loves having it on."
5,Great buy!!,"I was very pleased with the constellation night light. I bought one for both of my girls. The go to sleep every night looking at the stars. It is great how the color can be changed for your preference. The amber is a little dim, but my girls prefer the blue or green. I found it on sale and decided to buy it. I probably would not pay full price though. The original price is a little steep for a night light. Overall, wonderful product. My niece came over for the holidays and loved it. Her parents bought one for Christmas for her as well."
5,THIS IS 2ND TURTLE I'VE BOUGHT AT MY NEPHEW'S REQUEST,I originally bought this twilight turtle for my first nephew when he was 2; His little brother is now the same age and has been begging for one of his own b/c his big brother uses his all the time. I don't think you can get a better review than that!!!!!
5,Great turtle,My 2.5 yr old loves this turtle. Extra bonus I didn't think of when I bought it is that it is easy to take with you anywhere. It will come in handy on trips.
4,Almost perfect,"I bought this for my 20 month old who loves to look at and is learning about the stars. She loves her ""baby-bug"" to rock to sleep with and loves to carry it around the house during the day. It's soft, easy to use, and is bigger than I expected it to be. The only downside to it, that I have found, is that it needs to be placed in the center of the room in order for the whole star system to be visible. This creates the problem of having to avoid tripping over it in a dark bedroom. If not for that, I would have called the lady bug ""perfect""."
3,good,"this toy was a cute idea. my baby loves the color of the turtle when it lights up, but he isnt very interested in the stars that are projected. the stars dont move, it is just a light bulb under a plastic shell with star shaped holes in it. i thought the idea of having real constellations was cute but you cant see them! in a small room the stars are spread out on the ceiling and the walls making it impossible to identify. in a big room the stars are so faint, it again, is impossible to identify. i would recommend this, b/c the calming color lighting the room is a great night light and does help my baby to go to sleep."
5,children love this product,My son played with this product at a cousins house(he is 2) and would not stop talking about the moon and stars.It is a great nightlight and portable to take anywhere.
5,Cloud b Turtle-night light,"Cloud b Twilight Turtle - Constellation Night LightMy Grand-daughter loves Mr.Cloud B.Turtle,he's soft underneath, and lights up her night.Shuts off automatically. Helps her sleep alone."
5,Kids Loved It,"I bought the turtle, sea turtle and ladybug night light. They were bought for kids 4, 5 & 7. All three loved them. As soon as they opened their Christmas packages they grabbed the night lights and headed for the walk in closet. They enjoyed playing with them. They now turn them on every night."
3,runs thru batteries!,We received this as a Christmas gift for our daughters to share. The 7 yr old & 2 yr old LOVE it. We have lighter colored walls (girly pastels) and the amber is actually the color that works best- the other colors just seem weak. We've went thru a set of batteries and haven't even had this 3 weeks yet. We sat ours on top of the bookshelf in our daughters room for the stars to show up where she could see them from lying in her crib.
5,LOVE it.,"This did what it said it would. The colors are enough light I can nurse my three month old by, but we can sleep if it's on. My son likes to look at the stars and I find myself looking for the constellations while I nurse him. The turtle is on the changing table that's attached to a pack n play. It is not in the middle of the room but the stars are clear and not blurry. All in all worth the money."
4,"Room for improvement, but delivers!","This is a glorified night-light in a semi-soft toy; but it cured our little guy of his fear of the dark so it'd buy it all over again.It has 3 light modes, one for blue stars, one for green stars and one that lights up images of sea-creatures around the edge of the shell. The buttons are easy enough to manipulate our 2 year old has no issue turning the turtle on himself. I find it annoying in the dark as all the buttons are the same size & shape and end up standing there for two minutes pushing all the buttons to get it to turn on to what I want. You can turn on both blue and green lights to get an aqua sort of colour.The light is very bright, and with fresh batteries you can see the stars in even a dimly lit room.I wish the toy played some gentle music, or even had realistic looking constellations; but you can't argue with success!"
1,Disappointed with product,Product did not work. We had to return it to Amazon for refund. We chose not to reorder but purchased another gift for our great granddaughter instead.
3,So cute! Wish it lasted longer....,"My 2 year old adores this ladybug! I got her the blue-green one, and I was very excited about the new colors. She slept with it most every night, but now after 4 months the bulbs in the lights have burned out, and there is no way to replace them. I am so disappointed! We will try getting one of the originals this time, as they seem to get better reviews for lasting longer. I sure wish the ones with the cute colors were made to last!"
5,happiness,"It came in a timely fashion! Thanks. This is something our granddaughter has wanted for quite some time. What fun it will be to give it to her this week end. She is a cute little ""drama queen"" so we are thinking it will be priceless to see her expressions!"
4,Perfect size,"I got this for my nursery and even though the product took awhile to get here, I think it is the perfect size. Not too big and not too small. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1. Easy to operate.2. Wireless, use 3 triple A battery.3. You can search for constellation.4. Auto shut off in 45 minutes.5. 3 different light setting.6. Good size.Cons:1. Took awhile to get here.2. If you need to change the battery, you will need a screwdriver to unscrew.3. You will to find a good platform to place this if you care about searching for the constellation. Probably in the middle of the room but who does that?4. Amber light is useless."
2,it was damaged and of poor quality,"Well, it got here fast enough and was a good deal, but it looked like it had been kicked all over town, packaging damaged, product scuffed, the thing that holds the batteries in doesn't snap on at all. I felt like I was giving my daughter garbage, instead of a reward for sleeping in her own bed and putting herself to sleep. What a piece of crap!"
4,Excellent Gift for young children,This was a birthday present for my 3 year old granddaughter. She absolutely loved it as did my 12 year old granddaughter. They both sat for hours looking at the stars and constellations. I think I will be purchasing another one for the 12 year old! Good idea and lots of fun for small children. This is an excellent gift for any young child.
5,Great sleep experience,"I have purchased 3 of these for different grandchildren, and they love them. They make bedtime a new fun experience."
3,"great for child's room ambiance, but breaks easily","Good for young child's room- ambiance only, not educational.5-pointed stars, we had it about 5' away from ceiling and stars were large & cartoonish, but my 3-yr old loved them. Fairly good- size projection, not entire room but covered the entire 1/4 to 1/2 of room where his bed is.We used it every night, and yes the auto-shutoff is great on the batteries. It broke within about 4 months. Now looking for planetarium which IS educational, but still has the same allover ambient light/ larger image. Why is this so hard to find?"
2,My son won't sleep without it but there are some major flaws,"I can no longer support this product. My son loves his turtle and won't sleep alone without it. However, I have had issues getting batteries to work in the turtle, only brand that was working for me was EverReady. I emailed the company and they basically responded that this is a known issue with ""some"" turtles especially with Energizer and Duracell and they offered to send me one pack of batteries. I am going to be calling them to discuss this further but just be prepared that you too might get one that only accepts certain battery brands."
2,much a hype about nothing,3 colorful led lights covered by a plastic with simple star shaped holes (not constellations!) on top of a plush toy. If you're a bit creative you can make your own.You have to place it relatively high in order for it to reflect on the ceiling (on a table and not the floor)Our newborn was not engaged even when we reflected the stars on his bassinet sides.
3,Missing items from the box,"I gave this ladybug to my daughter (5yo) for Christmas. Unfortunately it did not come with an instruction booklet (is the 45 minute sleep timer automatic, or do I have to do something to turn it on?) nor did it have the adoption certificate or book with it. My daughter doesn't know the difference, but I am disappointed that the product was incomplete.Also, the red lights are not even close to being bright enough to be seen on the ceiling."
4,Almost Perfect,"I bought this for my 2-year-old daughter because she recently transitioned from a crib into a bed. In her crib, she had the Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium, which lights up and plays music, so naturally, I thought the turtle would be perfect for her new bed. Unfortunately, it does not play music. For that reason, I only give this 4 stars. I realize that the product information says nothing about it playing music, but I assumed on my own that it did because it would make a lot of sense. Needless to say, I was disappointed, but my daughter absolutely loves it and that's what matters."
5,Great product!,"I ordered this ladybug for my 4-year-old daughter who is afraid of the dark. I wanted something to give a little light in her room, but not so bright that she wouldn't be able to sleep. This night light is perfect. The stars give just enough light, and the timer is great. We keep the light on as she falls asleep, and then it turns off automatically after 45 minutes. We love this nightlight!"
4,Awsome purchase!,"I had bought this for my 2yr old daughter whom seemed facinated with stars. This had some rudimentary constellations and all the stars are the same size, very large. There are 3 colors to change to, but the amber is very dim and hard to see. Even with these small insignificantdetails, my daughter thinks it is the best thing, and requests it every bedtime for the the past 6 months. She drags it around and plays ""tent"" with it as she lays and looks at them. If your child has any interest in stars, this will give that one a load of joy."
5,Love it!,"I bought this for my granddaughter's room when they come over to stay the night. They love it and so do it. My oldest granddaughter(8) was having fun trying to pick out constellations and the little one(3) just enjoyed the stars on the ceiling. This shouldn't be considered a ""toy"" though, it is more of a night light and could be broken by a small child if they are allowed to carry it around and drop it."
1,Died two days after I got it,"Lady Bug worked beautifully...for one night. Changed the batteries, followed directions, no results. If I didn't have a sleep-hating baby, I'd probably have the wherewithal to return this thing. It's impossible to change the lightbulb (or even get to it, just to see if there's a loose/dirty connection). I like being able to fix things without disemboweling them!"
2,"Lighting effect is cool, battery life is terrible","This is a really neat toy, it looks adorable to my 5 year old, the blue and green lighting is really cool. I agree with others that the yellow color is not very visible. However, this light is a constant pain for me. The batteries only last through 3 nights and I did verify that it shuts off after 20 minutes. I bought rechargeable batteries so I am not throwing so many away, however the compartment for the batteries is so tight that it requires a small flat head screwdriver to get the batteries out. This can require some hunting around in my house. A note for the design company that If you design it after a turtle, make it a little larger so you can use C or D type batteries, not AAA batteries."
4,Love it!,"I use this in my 14 month old daughters bedroom every night and she loves it - wont fall asleep without it. You can choose the color, the amber color is really dim for a darker room while the green and blue are a bit brighter allowing for some visibility in an otherwise dark room. I only wish it had a plug in option and an option to leave it on all night. But the batteries have lasted for months and when my little one wakes up in the middle of the night, we just have to hit the on button and back to sleep she goes. Would definitely buy again and again."
4,Great toy but not really orange,"This is a favorite toy of my grandson. He was so excited about the idea that he might get this for Christmas that we couldn't keep ourselves from giving it to him early. It's a great toy that helps make going to bed at night more fun. Be aware though that when the lights are not turned on, the turtle's shell is a mocha color with a hint of green rather than the orange shown in the picture. That's why I'm giving it the 4 stars. The stuffed part of the turtle is a medium green."
3,Just Ok,"This was not an amazing addition to our nursery. The product was OK, it didn't dazzle. The motivation for this review is durability. Somehow my 18 month old, while exploring the turtle, managed to pull the soft stuffed part away from the shell. I didn't think that would be an issue."
4,Really cute!,"I've had this night light for my daughter little over 6 months now and it works really good, it's really cute. It's had 3 different lights, but in all honesty it's kind of a waste seeing as how the setting ""blue"" looks better than the other colors. All in all it's a very good product I recommend it to all mommies"
5,"Excellent ""Night Light""","Great product. Works well and already survived a few hard knocks and drops. My kids love it and it's worth every penny I paid. I highly recommend this product, especially for kids with fears of the dark."
5,Yay!,I wanted this for my almost 2 daughter for as long as I can remember.Should of gotten one sooner! It's adorable. It was a toss up between the ladybug and turtle but I love sea turtles so I had to get this for her. I tried it in our bathroom to make sure t works. Yup it does and it's adorable.Maybe I'm more in love with the face of the turtle! I read in another review that there are some fakes out there on amazon so beware. I got a legit one :) the shell is hard so I hope she doesn't wake up if she ends up sleeping with it. But hey it's cool I love it. I also have the sound sheep from cloud b and she loves it too ;)
4,Fantastic product!!,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she opened it early. She loves it!! Its a great product but the amber color doesn't show well.
5,Excellent safe toy! Great for autistic kids too!,"Great item! Arrived safely in package. I have seen this constellation night light before and the other models from the same company. They are all awesome. This is my 2nd one and I can say that even with ALOT of use, it was over a month that I needed to replace the batteries and that is impressive! The stars hit the walls and ceiling and fill the room with color. Even the cats love to see this on. This will be a definate hit.I mention this is also a great item for autistic kids because of their attraction to lights. This makes my nephew so happy and giggly and I point out the moon to him. He loves it and having the timer is a great feature."
2,Not what I expected,"It has to be very close to the ceiling--maybe 4 feet away--for it to look like stars on the ceiling. I had to hold it up high. The batteries came with it, so they were fresh batteries. I was very disappointed, as it was a gift. If it was for myself, I would have returned it. It seemed like it would be really cool."
1,terrible experience with Amazon,"I ordered this product for my granddaughter on Saturday and received it today - totally amazed at the speedy service. However when I opened the box I discovered that the batteries were not included and the Storybook, Adoption certificate and Star Guide were all missing. Clearly this is a returned item!This is the first time I received a sub standard item from Amazon. In fact I tried to make sure that it is sold by Amazon to ensure I receive good product and I am very disappointed. I do not know what else shoud be included in the box - all I received was a turtle that would not work."
2,only lasts 3 nights,"I got this for my baby shower, but my 2 year old son LOVES it!! I loved it also until I realized that I had to change the batteries every 3 nights! Batteries are expensive. My son asks for his stars every night, but I have to tell him that they are broken. I'm extremely disappointed and think it is horribly designed if it only lasts 3 nights, and that's even when it turns off automatically after 45 minutes, so it really only gets less than an hour and a half of working time before the batteries need to be changed."
5,"Bright vivid colors, our girls love it!!","We purchased the lady bug version of this back in December 2010 for our 3 year old daughter. She has been going through the night fears disliking the dark very much. When we received this we were so excited and she just LOVED it! We went through all three colors, and the blue one was the one that worked the best..our daughter calls it purple of course, and it's her favorite one. :) The green is her second favorite, not quite as bright as the blue, but still wonderful. The red was not really visible..we never use that one. When we first bought this product, we had issues with the batteries having to change them quite often, but now not so much. I haven't changed the batteries in it for a couple of months now...and it's still going strong.**UPDATE**Almost 1.5 years later, this product is still going strong. We have 2 girls now and we have one in each of their rooms. They both just love this product. I would recommend it to anyone!"
5,Love it,What can we say these are awesome my daughters room lights up at night with her own set of stars and moon in colors.
3,"Not bad, but glad I didn't pay full retail in a store",I guess maybe I expected more...music or movement or something. Still good as a nightlight and it projects very well. I'm just glad I didn't pay more than $25.
4,Rave from Mom,I bought this for one of my nephews since he was too young for anything substantial for Christmas. This has been a huge hit in their house and even the older boys try and steal it for their rooms.
3,My son loves it...a little too much for sleeping,"We gave this to my son when he was a little over a year old. He gets so excited when he sees it that it would never help him fall asleep. We tried it one night by putting it on the changing table in his room. He wouldn't stop standing in his crib and was whining for us to give him the turtle. I read a lot of reviews before buying this because I suspected that it wouldn't promote sleep for him. So maybe we just have an easily overstimulated boy. We mainly just use it for playing and looking at the stars now. I agree with other reviewers that the amber or orange setting is very dim. Ideally, you would have the turtle on an elevated surface in the middle of the room for there to be stars all over the ceiling, but it works okay just putting it on a dresser or changing table. I don't think it would be a great thing for a child to sleep with because of the hard shell. If you want that, then maybe a Dream Lite would work better for you."
5,Good product,"It is a very good product, it seems solid and long lasting.The colors and stars are really soothing, I almost just want to keep it for myself and get another one for my baby."
2,"Loved at first, until it stopped working","Bought this nightlight for my 3 year old who was developing a fear of the dark. We were very pleased with this product for about the first 3 months, then the green and blue lights (which we primarily used as they were the brightest) started to fade. So we switched to the amber about a month ago, and now that color no longer works. In fact, nothing works now, despite changing the batteries. I am very disappointed, as this comfort item that we relied upon to help my daughter get to sleep has stopped working for no apparent reason. I expected more from this product, as it wasn't cheap and looked like a good quality product. But this is not the case."
3,isn't worth the money,"The item projects a starry night sky onto the walls and ceiling, but to have this sky looks nice the lamp should be in specific position, in the middle of room and not far from ceiling.Cheap plactic,broken easily."
5,Shows up really well!,"Half of the reviews I read before purchasing this turtle said that the stars did not show up well, and the other half said that they were great. Verdict: They show up great, even the amber color, although the blue and green are obviously darker colors and therefore show up better. I sat the tutle on the floor and the stars were still easily visible and fairly sharp on the ceiling and all four walls."
5,best buy ever!,"My 2 yr old daughter LOVES the moon and stars. Most night, clouds cover the moon and she can't she it....and asks doe it allllllll night. The turtle is amazing! She absolutely loves it and has to go to sleep to it every night. In fact, she will bring it upstairs to our room and we have to lay on the bed and look at it."
3,battery holder,"I spent FOREVER trying to open the battery holder! It has a screw on the outside and then a washer on the inside keeping it closed. I understand wanting to childproof the toy, but the way they did it was kind of excessive. Also, nowhere in the instructions does it state there is a washer, so I was just spinning my screwdriver like a moron instead of trying to pry the thing open.Once that obstacle was overcome, the turtle is great! The green and blue stars are much brighter and visible then the amber, but I already knew that from other reviews."
5,Transitioning Tool,"We used this ""night light"" in our room when our infant was still sleeping in there near us at night. She got used to seeing the lights as she went to sleep, so when we transitioned her to her crib in the nursery a few months after she was born, the lights were familiar. We also took the turtle with us when we traveled, so she would have something familiar there too.Worked great!We love the soft light, and assume it will be something our daughter keeps for much longer than the rest of her ""baby"" toys."
3,"Very cute, wish that the stars moved or flickered","I got this for my two month old son because he loves looking at lights. I should've read the description more closely, because I thought the stars would move around or at least flicker. The stars are stationary. I have to use it on the green light because the amber light doesn't show up on his light blue walls at all. The stars and moon show up decent enough with the blue or green light. Its very cute though, hopefully he'll enjoy it more when he's older."
4,Great product for kids,"We purchased the turtle a couple of years back and my daughter always wanted the color red to illuminate her room, (the turtle has yellow, green and blue lights). We have recently purchased the twilight ladybug and while it has red, our elder child still sticks with the color blue when she borrows her sister's ladybug. The constellations on the ladybug are a lot larger than those on the twilight turtle, and while our infant is too young to understand, I think she'll love it as much as her sister. The power on/off button on the shell is a good improvement from the turtle, whose power off option is hidden on the underside of the turtle instead of conveniently on the shell.A great buy."
5,cloud b twilight,I bought this for my 2 year old neice for Christmas. She loves it. Also educational because it come with a booklet to let you know about the constellations.
1,Completely unusable,"Very unhappy. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Tried it out when I got it, worked great. Daughter opened it and LOVED it. since it worked great, I threw out the packaging. The next morning, after first night of use, the batteries were dead. I thought, fluke, no biggie, put new batteries in. Next day, dead again. Put new batteries in again, made SURE it shut off after 45min, it did. I turned switch off just for good measure. Next night, went to turn it on, completely dead. After trying to use it for a week and changing the batteries a total of 5 times, we gave up. It now sits, dead, on my daughters bed like a lump. I can't return it, thew out packaging and even if I could, I don't want a credit, I want one that WORKS. My daughter loved it and is completely disappointed. And so am I."
5,Second one!,"I bought this cute little guy for my daughter. It is to replace the ""turtle"" version of the same product that the light has burnt out in. She can't go to sleep with out these guys, she loves them! She is seven. They make the most beautiful stars around the room! I am going to see about a replacement bulb to bring turtle back to life."
5,Wow! Cool! Oh my! Gee! Holy cow! Duuuude!!,"I am a big fan of trance music, especially melodic, club and progressive trance. This is a great collection of amazing sounding trance music that will get you jumpin'! There are few trance collection CD's that really spark my interest the whole way through the mix. This is a great mix! Of course there are some songs I like more than others, as a whole this is a fun music album. If you like trance dance music, get this CD! You will not be disappointed! Very cool! :) Yeehaw!"
1,Yuck!,Falling apart - terrible material - cheap!Save ten bucks and pick something else! Not worth the money - at all.
5,I Loved This Shirt,This was one of my favorite shirts. It fit well and lasted quite a while. The green was also very flattering to my skin tone. I think I'll go buy another one now...
2,Shirt,This is a shirt that runs extremely small - I would say it is a junior or teen - not a woman's size.
1,People! Don't waste your money!!,"Chrysler/jeep/dodge/plymouth all allow you to retrieve engine codes for free with a tool you already own. THE IGNITION KEY! Google ""Chrysler key dance"" You will find instructions to retrieve the engine codes."
3,"Not what I was expecting, but still useful","I had researched this product at Jegs.com - an online auto parts site - and was told that the ""system"" was an electronic code reading device by the service rep. After a lengthy shipping delay I cancelled the order from Jegs and ordered it from Amazon - at a discounted price compared to Jegs.com (yay). While I was expecting an electronic code reading device, the engine code manual will still allow me to diagnose electrical and electronic faults in my vehicle. The blame is mine and mine alone for not double-checking with Amazon as to whether the ""system"" was a device or a manual. Mea Culpa."
5,Truthful book about real life,"This book should be a obligatory reading anytime before one is 21 years old. You can find proof in everyday life that the work of Sternberg is not only true and informative, but also very useful. I find it helpful that the author places himself in his work (only a couple of times its just a little bit too much). It's a excellent read for those trying to find and understand the key to succes in life. Your grades in school have nothing to do with it, by the way. As a teacher, a parent and a communicator, I appreciate this book very much. Also read The Millionare Mind, by Thomas Stanley, as adittional and very well sustained proof that the theories of Sternberg are accurate. It's a highly recommended reading accesible for anyone."
1,A little too personal,"Sternberg's fills this book with a little too many personal anecdotes (i.e., with himself as central figure) to feel comfortable with the objectivity of his scholarship. The title should be Attributes of Successful People, but it does not seem to be about intelligence, nor does the author seem to have a consistent meaning for the term intelligence. At times he expands his generally valid complaints about intelligence tests to include acheivement and all other tests, despite the fact that they presumably measure acheived knowledge and not ability or potential to learn. There is little to explain why he settled on just his three types of intelligence (analytical, creative, and practical) and at times, he seems to be implicitly accept some of Gardner's, such as spatial intelligence."
3,It stops palmetto bugs but doesn't kill,When I drowned a palmetto bug in the spray it still managed to get away into a crack but it didn't die. I ended up smashing a very quick palmetto bug the next day and I'm sure it was the same one because it exploded with a very potent minty odor. It has paralyzed a bug long enough to smash it so I still prefer it to poison but I wish I could skip the squishing.
2,Not so great,"This spray kills most ants within 5 - 10 seconds, but does not appear to inhibit further ant infestations. Some family members find the smell of the spray quite objectionable."
2,Not nearly as effective or pleasant as the old Cedar scented one.,"The first time I used Victor Poison-Free Ant and Roach Killer, its active ingredient was Cedar Oil (M631) and it was not only very effective against ants, it had a pleasant smell, and didn't bother me or my cat. I thought I had my ant problem solved in a safe, healthy way. When I ran out, all that I could find was the product by the same name, but with Mint oil (M601). It is not nearly as effective, some ants die, some don't, and new ones just crawl right through the sprayed areas on their way to further explorations of my house. And though I normally like mint flavor and smell, this was offensive and caused me congestion. My cat was even wheezing and avoiding the stuff. I wonder what it would take to get them to make the Cedar oil one again!"
1,At least it smells nice,"We shook it upside down for 15 seconds. We continued to shake it in between sprays. We initially sprayed an entire area of our kitchen where we see them most, enough to where our entire house smelled like mint for about 12 hours. Then we went outside and sprayed the exterior. 2 days later, we saw 2 roaches. It seemed to stun one roach enough to manually kill it. When we sprayed the rest of the can on the other roach, it finally died after about a minute. I thought ""Kills in seconds"" meant that it would kill in a few seconds, like under 30, but I guess the company was rather liberal with that. I'm really disappointed and don't know what I did wrong."
1,not worth the time,"I thought the book was truley horrible. Although the summery seems exiting the book is terribly dull and makes James Dean out as a phsyco murderer.Save your money, I wish i had"
5,The best ever for eczema,"My daughter suffered terribly as a child from eczema and Hydrolatum was recommended to us by Children's Hospital in Boston. She is now 18 and still uses it from time to time - it is the absolute best! It is also great for any kind of run of the mill dry skin - chapped lips, dry feet, cuticles, etc."
4,Use for severe dryness,"You only need a tiny bit for it to work and this is a big tub! Great for tiny dry patches and for repairing dry heels. A small amount should be used on the dry area only. Other areas that are not effected should be avoided because the cream is very heavy. For heels, prepare your feet and put as much as you want on the problem area. Then wear socks overnight..."
5,"Dry, Cracked Feet - GONE!!!","Hydrolatum works wonders on dry, cracked feet. It's been discontinued so grab it while you can!!"
4,"Pretty good calculator, and the price is so affordable in Amazon","i use it for my accounting class, but 8/10 students use different type of calculator in class so does the professor, but then the professor told me that this calculator is neat (i thought so too, thats why i bought it, and you can not get it cheaper anywhere else for new, love the sliver look) and my professor also use it as well (he got 2 calculators), over all this calculator is easy to use, just like the other brand (almost same button), and the manual is not that helpful when calculate the PV,FV,Annuity, but i got help from my professor. Still after you learn how to use it and you will love it."
4,"Generally, a good financial calculator","This Product is very functional except that the buttons are a little hard to press. Make sure you check the numbers that you enter. I have found frequently that the numbers that I pressed were not always entered/displayed. Also the manual that comes with the calculator does not cover how to do some of the things that it is capable of doing. I have had to search online for ways to enter things to get the answers I was looking for. Other than that, it does what it's supposed to."
4,a Good Buy!,"I am taking the CFA exam next June and needed to get a professional calculator. I read the reviews for both the TI and the HP.. While there seemed to be some concern for ease of use of the TI, the HP seemed too complicated to learn. I ultimately went with the recommendation of the review course which suggested the TI. The price was excellent and I have not been disappointed with the decision!!! There are some neat features on the TI that have been fun to learn... Oh, and check out the free video tutorials you can find by going to TI's website. Good times! - Steve"
2,Worst key entry ever!,"This calculator looks nice and has great functionalities no doubt, but it's the worst key entry experience I've ever had with any calculators! The keys are simply too hard and one would need to exert a lot more force down on each of the keys for the input to register. As such, like many have complained in the previous posts, this makes calculation extremely slow, not because the calculator itself is not able to perform the task, but to punching in all your numbers would simply take too long and too much effort, with the added risk of not being able to enter everything correctly because the key pad is just so damn hard to press!So frustrating! Why can't they just learn a thing or two from the casio fx series, once you've used those calculators you never want to touch another one again. Too bad casio doesn't make cfa approved calculators.I'm starting to really really hate using this calculator."
5,Excellent alternative to the HP 10BII,I was having problems with my HP 10BII calculator (about a year old) and the poor display of characters. Decided to go the TI route and believe this will be the better choice. The financial capabilities between the two were not a factor in the decision.
4,Stupid Idea,The leather case is so stupid. Anything in my bag could potentially touch the on/off button under the leather case and turn the calculator on .
4,Good one,"I used to use casio's calculator. Not only the finance one but also the scientific one. To use casio's calculator is really easy that you would know how to use it even without guide book. However, the Taxas one is the one could be used in CFA exam. Not that easy to understand how to use as casio but not that difficult as I image. Once you got it's logic, you will know how to count on it."
1,Doesn't work,"I don't get it. I just got my second one and neither worked. I don't get it. The little example card that comes with it: 36N, 50000.00PV, 9.75I/Y, compute payment. Should be -1607.50. Both calculators I just went through give me -5052.39. Doesn't work!Cudos to Amazon for working with me on this.Very dissapointed."
4,The awesomeness that is the calculator,"It does what it needs to do for the 2/FM Actuarial exam. That's all I care about. No, really. I don't care about anything else. Oh, and sometimes the buttons stick."
5,Great calculator,I bought this for my accounting classes. There's going to be a bit of a learning curve to use the various financial calculations but it's a good sturdy calculator. I like the feel and the look.
3,Slow Input - nightmare for fast fingers,"This is a decent calculator, however has serious input flaws. The system cannot register fast inputs, so if you are a user who uses your calculator with both hands, THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU. It is unable to register numbers at such speeds. So the trick is to slow down the entry, use only one hand to input numbers. I have been using TI calculators since college and never had this problem before. Also, it has an extremely thin cover that doesn't protect the keys and the look feels very cheap. Otherwise it is OK."
3,"Don't love it, I just had to get it for the CFA","I only got it because it's one of the two calculators allowed for the CFA exam. I took this one over the HP one, because the HP is very old fashioned and it has a non-conventional way of inputing functions. If you don't need to take the CFA, I would not really recommend this one as a financial calculator. I would much rather use my HP 10B."
1,poor entry speed,"I'm throwing this thing away. I've tried to use this calculator at work every day for the past 3 weeks. It's going in the trash tonight before I leave. We have 5 at work, all have the same issue. You must enter one digit, take a breath, enter another digit, take a breath, enter another digit, take a breath, etc. If you try to enter 123456789 quickly, you end up with 13579, it misses every other number. All 5 perform the same. If you are slow at entering numbers in a calculator, maybe that works for you, but I need it for a living and don't have time to wait on a calculator to process an entry. JUNK. I would give it zero stars if I could."
1,Dont buy if you are not sitting the CFA EXAMS,"I purchased this calculator and its predecessor for use in the CFA examinations.I purchased this one because I thought the keys would be easier and more fluid to the touch I have to say I hate them both equally.The keys are hard to push, so you are never sure if you really pushed them, if you add numbers and accidentally press equal which is easy to do because the keys are so close together them you have to re add the whole sequence.It does not come in a hard caseThere is no multi line feature to see the numbers you are adding, so very 1980's. I recommend anyone that uses a calculator on a regular basis buy a simple students calculator to use, if you dont have to buy this for the CFA examinations.rubbish"
3,It's Okay,"This financial calculator is good, does what it's supposed to do, but the keys are too rigid, so you might need to repeat your strokes quite often."
4,Great!,"I bought this for a statistics class and it has really come in handy. The only issue that I have is that the ON/OFF button is in the same place as my old calculator's C/CE button, so I keep turning it off when I try to clear numbers. I guess that is just something that I will have to get over."
5,great,This product is very fairly priced and Im glad I bought this for my class. It came really quick in the mail!!
3,standard calculator for cfa exam,"minus two stars because the buttons are a bit slow to register - quite an annoyance for me, but i'm getting used to it. just something to keep in mind while choosing between this or the 12c."
5,One of the Best,"This is one of the best financial calculator available in the market. It can perform all basic calculations as well as complex ones. The manual is detailed which helped me learn how to operate it. I already had another financial calculator but since it is most widely used, I bought it anyway and I'm glad I did."
3,Fast Delivery.. but missing directions.. screen slightly scratched.,"Fast Delivery.. but missing manual.. screen slightly scratched. I have a Corporate Finance class I need this calculator for, so I don't have time to return it. But it seems to work fine."
3,Difficult to hit buttons,"I bought this calculator because my upper division accounting courses required a financial calculator rather than a graphing, infact grpahing calculators were not allowed on tests. So since I am going into the accounting profession I figured I'd buy a quality calculator to last me into my career. I love the look of it, very sleek and professional however the buttons are slow to register. What I mean is if I am try to do a quick calculation, and I am punching in numbers rapidly a few would not get recognized despite it being fully pressed down. Very aggrivating when you are trying to compute simple calculations quickly."
2,Unintuitive,"The normal calculation functions work fine and are the same as you'd see with any other calculator, but the method for using the business-specific functions is awkward and unintuitive. Find a different calculator if you need this for a finance class."
3,"Useful for calculating annuities and bonds, but not too much else.","I like this calculator, but wish it had a multiview screen. I used to use it often to calculate annuities and bonds, but I actually prefer to just solve them on a different calculator with a better screen using memorized equations."
3,Button issues,"Calculator (TI BA II Advanced Pro) is awesome--appearance, utility, and speed.But, I'm in the process of returning it, because the ""division"" & ""multiplication"" buttons are inconsistent--press it and it works, at times you need to press the buttons 2-4 times for it to work, and a few times it I have to redo my work (frustrating).Anyway, the seller was gracious enough to allow me to return the calculator. I'm torn because it is a great business calculator and I'm not sure if I should order another (because I received a lemon) or if I should go with something else."
5,Great Deal,Great deal on a nice financial calculator. Half the price I'd pay at the university bookstore.
3,Almost Great!,"I bought this calculator because it is only one of two calculators allowed for use on the CFA exam. I have been very pleased with the calculator so far. In my MBA Real Estate Investments class it performed like a champ. I was able to perform NPV, IRR, and Amortization calculations faster and simpler than my classmates who were using the recommended HP 10B. Amortization is especially easier because the 10B limits the number of periods to 90, but the BAII allows longer, more realistic amortization periods like 360 for a 30 year mortgage. This calculator also processes much faster than the HP calculators.This calculator has two big disadvantages compared to the HP 17BII+:1) The BAII can only handle numbers to the single billion digit (10 digits).2) The TVM function requires more key strokes than 17BII+.Other than those two things, I really like this calculator."
2,The buttons are horrible!,"I have to churn out huge quantities of numbers using this bad boy but the biggest problem I have is with the buttons!The case has an overall cheap feel which is fine by me, I mean hey! I am not going to be using these as personal defense weapons or anything but man would this have been so much better if only they had had the Chinese manufacturers put some better keys on these! I am sure they would've been able to do it."
3,Good for Financial Calculations...,"This calculator is amazing at financial calculations with its ability to calculate annuities and convert from interest rates to discount rates very quickly. The one thing I have against it is that as a normal calculator it's not very effective. It doesn't flash when you press a button so it's hard to tell if you actually hit the button or not, also it doesn't seem to register quick number typing so some times I need to go back and press it again. It runs with a certain ""chain rule"" calculation order but you can change it back to normal. Either way you need to use a lot of parentheses. (Ex: 5*(1+0.6)^12 needs to be written like (5)*((1+0.6))^12) Overall, I keep a regular scientific next to this one so I can switch between calculations, but it is a pain to have 2 calculators in general."
2,I hate these buttons,"Maybe I'm just used to my TI-89 Plus Scientific Calculator, but I had to buy this one for class and I hate the buttons. I always mess up when entering formulas because you have to push the buttons exactly right. I spend way to much time using this stupid thing and if it weren't for my class, I would have sent it right back. BUT it does have all the necessary functions for a finance person."
4,Great calculator for what is it,Hey I bought this calculator because of a recommendation from my teacher. I am currently studying to be an actuary and it is great it has all the great cash flow work sheets interest converter pv fv calculator and such its great for what it was made for but. its not that user friendlyi mean the buttons are such a pain. they are sort of stiff so i have to a really hard time trying to dial them in. also some of the functions are very different from what i am used to from texas instruments. its a great value to buy it at amazon u save at least 50% so if u need this get it at amazon
2,Nearly unsuable,"This calculator performs all the functions you'd expect of it. In terms of actual design, the only thing additionally I'd ask for is perhaps a second line on the LCS for reviewing calculations algebraically.But there exists one huge problem. While the buttons give a very positive *click* when you press them, it seems about one time in 10 or 15 the key press fails to register. As I normally touch-type on the number pad, it renders the device next to worthless. The only way to ensure you calculations come out right is to stare at the screen after each....and....every....key press. That might be great for high school kids taking a finance class, but it is worthless for the ""Professionals"" the product name would imply might use it.The only thing keeping this piece of junk from getting a single star from me is that yes, it does technically work. But only if you watch it like a delinquent 12 year old."
5,Great Business Calculator!,"I'm studying finance, and my old TI86 doesn't have a finance module, so I decided to buy this Calc instead of getting that module. It was a good choice, as I wanted a calculator just for finance calculations. If you are looking for something to calc TVM, Amotization Worksheets, Cash Flow Worksheet, bonds; this is for you. Easy to use and a great guide book"
3,"Works great, just too pricy.","This product is great as a financial calculator. There is a lot to learn to get all you can out of the calculator, but all the material can be searched and learned online. I wish it came with a harder case so that I did not have to worry about it breaking. There is a lower model that comes with a hard case that has the exact same button locations and functionality, but it is cheaper. So I would really recommend that rather than this model. The only reason you would need this version is if you need to perform calculations in front of clients so its a nicer and more professional looking device. I hope this review helps."
1,Below average for the price...,PROS: 1) Looks very nice.CONS: 1) Cheap case. 2) Slow input and and below average response. 3) Some of the keys do not repsond the first time. This is extremely annoying! 4) High price.SUMMARY: Stick to the hp 12C. Its built like a tank.
1,This is not the same as the BAII Plus Prof from 6 yrs ago,The buttons on this calculator now feel extremely flimsy and are not the firm clicking that the original Professional had. You will certainly make calculation errors from the numbers not registering on the calculator.
1,Does not work well,"Calculator does not work well, the 1 is not functional, it types in 11. Makes calculating difficult."
5,Excellent Financial Calculator,I am an MBA student at AUM (American University in the Middle East).This calculator is very useful for my finance class .. I am starting to learn how to use it but it seems very nice!
2,"Good calculator, but.......","This is a well made calculator, but I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the manual, which is practically useless! It is obviously written by techno-nerds, who have poor communication and technical writing skills. When my trusty old HP-12C died, I decided to try the TI BA-II Plus Pro. For me, it was a bad decision! I needed to make some complex discounted net present value calculations for a client on short notice. I had to seek a ""how to manual "" from Grapevice Publications, as the TI manual is of scant help. The examples are few. I am returning to HPs. If assigning grades, I would give the calculator a B, but the manual an F. Trying to learn a new and unfamiliar financial calculator without a clear, well written manual was an exercise in frustration."
5,Excellent for CFP,I am studying for the CFP exam and needed this calculator. I wish I had this sooner in university. I used a scientific calculator that was not nearly as nice as this. The buttons press down with a nice feedback. I find my Sharp calculator harder to use than this.
4,Great calculator after TI fixed,"Calculator was not computing bond values correctly. Instructor tried and it gave him the same incorrect answer. Called TI several times. FINALLY learned it needed to be reset. Lower back is a small hole. Push a pin in GENTLY and hold for a second then release. Classmate bot hers from Office Max,at a higher price, it had same problem. Did the reset and now no problems. Great calculator. Gave it 4 star because of the problem I had until TI told me how to resolve. Hassle."
3,Inconsistent input,"Not a calculator you can use without staring at the calculator.The input is not very sensitive. As you input you need to stare at the calculator to catch input errors. Coupon=6.5% enters as 65. Pmt=200 enters as 20. If you are lucky, the computed result may be far enough off you can catch the error and review inputs."
3,Decent,"Loses one star for packaging. It was a PITA to open up. I cut my finger as I tried to open the packaging after using heavy duty scissors to cut the plastic. This is definitely something Amazon should offer with ""Frustration Free"" packaging.Loses another star for not having a hard cover case. It comes with a cheap leather bag to put it in. A hard cover case is necessary to keep the buttons from being pressed. I store mine in my backpack and I hate to always check and see if it turned on by mistake, which may drain the battery. This is the first Texas Instruments calculator I have bought that did not come with one.Build quality looks good, though buttons make a click sound. I haven't used it much yet, but it looks promising."
2,"Bad buttons, good calculator","Overall, this is a good calculator. It makes solving financial functions a breeze. The problem is with the buttons. They don't register when you push them. Anyone who can type or push buttons at a speed faster than very slow will be frustrated with this calculator."
4,Calc review,This Item arrived in good time and shape. I would recommend buying this product if you are in finance.
2,Unintuitive,"This is the most unintuitive calculator I've ever used. One example that I still could not figure out how to do in a convenient way: I have a number displayed in 2 floating decimal and I want to see it in 5 floating decimal, I have 2 ways: (1) multiply the current value with 1000, write down the number then divide it back 1000; (2) store the number to the memory, press [2nd][format][5][enter], then press [2nd][quit], then recall the number back from the memory. What kind of calculator is this? If somebody can show me a quicker way, I would appreciate it."
3,Good but It can be better,"I just received the calculator and the first impression is about it's external quality.The material is not too bad but the keys are hard to press.When I saw the back side, I found that it was MADE IN CHINA, I think the HP's are made in USA.The main reason to Return it, is because the screen display can be better.I used to use an HP 19BII Business Consultant wich have a great display for formulas, equations and so for. You can type and read in the screen the formula and pharentesis and avoid any confusion.I returned it to buy an HP 17II+ and also 12C platinum for the CFA exam."
5,TI BA II,Excelent product. Very easy to use and nice size for such a powerfull calculator. For my MBA classes has been very helpful.
3,TI BA II Plus Pro Financial Calculator,"I purchased a new calculator. When I opened the shipping box, I found that the packaging was open. I don't know how long the calculator was used for (nor how much battery power is left since the calculator has obviously been in use)."
5,Excellent CFA Calculator,"Far better than then lower model BA II, saved a ton of time in CFA prep by giving additional features. If you are preparing for CFA, it's a must buy."
2,3rd one in 2 months... buyer beware,"The calculator works all right, but they're not built to last. I'm on my third one in two months, as the first one suddenly stopped calculating correctly (my teacher and I both tried everything). Then the second one stopped working about ten days after I bought it. Now I'm on my third one, but I don't have very high hopes for it.The other thing is that the cover is oddly designed so it's hard to put on. Not a big fan.In all, it's an ok calculator, but I'm not sure I would buy it if I had a choice."
2,I didn't recieve my calculator,"I didn't recieve my calculator, and the seller says they lost my calculator in their labels, so I wait for one month, and I didn't see my calculator"
4,Does everything it says it should!,"Calculators aren't very exciting things. Funtional and helpful, yes! This TI does everything it says it should."
3,TI BAII Professional Calculator,"Overall, this product is a great tool for anyone taking finance, accounting or economics. However it can be rather confusing to use since there are so many functions. The user must be careful that each entry is inputted correctly as the calculator will provide an answer but potentially the wrong one. I think the book it comes with could be a little more explanatory with the proper settings for each function. Because of the multiple measures this calculator does, the user must change the settings several times. Overall, it is a good product but very confusing..."
4,Ti BA II,I was very impressed with the speed of delivery from this seller. Everything they said was included showed up and it works great thank you very much.
4,Great Calculator - Poor Keypad,Recently purchased this as a replacement to my old TI financial calculator. Overall it is a great calculator but the keys are very stiff and hard to press. I have already made numerous computational errors because the keys were not fully depressed.
4,"Excellent value, simple to use","The layout is like most traditional calculators, so if you've worked with other non-CFA certified calculators and/or are not accustomed to having to type additional keys (""Enter"" on the HP equivalent) to perform a simple function, then I recommend this calculator. The buttons are sized correctly, the labelling is clear and the calculator itself is not heavy or overly bulky. The instructions are also clear. The only negative that prevents me from rating this five stars is that I have to depress the buttons a little harder than I am accustomed to. So if I'm typing a calculation fast, I need to make sure I press all the numbers enough so that they all appear on the screen. But overall excellent value at Amazon pricing."
5,Great,I really like this calculator. I am an accounting student and this calculator helps me perform many accounting problems quickly. During my exams it helps to have a calculator which is pre-programmed with many of the necessary ratios. The worksheets are also extremely helpful.The buttons are a little stiff but that is not a con for me.It is also a very beautiful electronic machine.I plan to further my studies in the area of finance and many of the functions support that - it is CFA certified.I just plain and simple love it.
4,A Great Business Calculator,"I use the TI BA II Plus at work all the time. It's durable and fairly easy to use. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because the manual that comes with it could be a whole lot better. It tends to gloss over some functions, ie., the using the date computations. This is a function that I had to sit down and experiment with to master. Still, it's a great business calculator."
2,"Works well, but unsatisfactory buttons","This calculator has a nice design/look, and it's calculating powers and functionality are acceptable. However, the buttons are terrible. Punching numbers in too quickly, or if you neglect to place perfect pressure on one of the keys, can cause you to omitted various numbers into your calculations. I prefer to be able to enter numbers quickly with light touch to the calculator but there is something cheap or poorly engineered in regards to how the calculator receives inputs. Perhaps it is just my style, and may work properly for others, but I do find this aspect of the calculator disappointing. I will, however, add that the inexpensive price may be the trade off for superb key stroke handling."
2,Works incorrectly for calculations with brackets,"I bought this calculator as this is the recommended one for CFA exams. A simple math problem is not working quite right. Dont know if its design limitation or bug. Here is what I found. Find the value of 2 x ( -1 + 3 ) = 8 - incorrect. The same thing if u enter as 2 x ( 3 - 1 ) = 4 gives the correct answer. Something not working right when you have brackets. So, users beware."
3,"It's ok. Should have ""splurged"" for a multi-line model.","It gets the job done. I bought it because it was one of 2 models accepted by a professor. I prefer the TI-89Ti's Fin. Calc. flash app. because it has so many lines and shows all the other parameters I have already entered. With this calc., I often wonder ""does this make sense...? are all my values entered correctly?"" That just might be me, but in hindsight I think I would have asked my prof. if I could use my TI-89, then clear my memory in front of him, and sit up front. Also, the keys are a little ""sticky."" Not ""i dropped my sugary drink on it"" sticky but more like the ""clicky-pop-click"" sticky that some electronic devices have for their keypads - I prefer a softer keypad. I'd use it again, but only if I HAD to.Try this model before you buy it, if you can. You might really like it."
3,Not up to current standards,"I have two previous BA calculators from TI and this one is impressive in appearance and touch. Regrettably, the first function I tried failed.The calc. has a default date value of 12-31-1990 although you can enter your own dates for number-of-days computations. The problem is that the calculator accepts the year value as two digits as in 08 and not 2008. The consequence is that I can't calculate the number of days prior to 2000 (00). How about long term bonds? The user guide and calculator delivers ERROR 6 when I attempt a four digit year. Perhaps someone knows a work around but the manual and calculator are no help discovering it. Why doesn't TI allow date inputs like Hewlett Packard: 01.011950?"
2,Not Impressed,"Maybe I am spoiled by my old TI-82, but the quality of this calculator is not what I expected for $40. The buttons are frequently unresponsive, causing missed number entries and calculation errors. I am constantly retyping entries, which is frustrating and distracting. The results are accurate, but figuring out how to run present value, bond, and cash flow calculations can be a bit annoying. The input is not really all that intuitive for this technically inclined MBA student, although my problems may be caused by lack of experience in finance. Other students are using the HP equivalent and like it. I would try other options before choosing this calculator."
4,Great machine for reasonable price,This is a great machine. The only thing better would be to make the screen two lines instead of one. Its a little expensive though.
4,It's a good product and Amazon delivers it as soon as posible in a cheapest way.,"Amazon delivered this product in a safer, fast and cheaper way. I'm so comfortable with this BA II Plus Professional Financial Calculator."
3,the buttons are ultra-annoying,"I got this calculator because, well, it's one of the two *required* in order to take the CFA exam. I'd imagine most people reading this are aware of that.The buttons, ugh, obnoxious. They're small, and you have to apply enough pressure in order to get the digit to register, so every time you punch in a number you have to look up to make sure it went through. For working fast this downright SUX.Secondly, you always have to press the negative button AFTER you type the number... if you type it before, you won't get the change in sign.Other than those irritating items this calculator does the trick for the CFA, and consensus is that the HP alternative has just as many quirks or more. I'd never get either of them for actual finance work. Instead, I'd get a graphing calculator, which has all the options; is cheaper; you can see prior work; create your own functions, text, etc."
2,What happened to Solar,"I tried this calculator and liked it, BUT, it's not solar. I had a Radio Shack 15 year old financial calculator that was incredible but finally display went after years of daily use. And IT was solar. Why have a calculator that you have to tape extra batteries to to use? And they are expensive if you use it on a daily basis and need to replace. Maybe TI is getting kickbacks from battery manufacturers. So...I went with Casio FC-200V financial. Does all the TI and more. And Casio is environmentally consious and uses this ""new"" technology called solar."
2,why???,"y is that, too expensive for couple of cheap functions, and net result the CFA need you to have this super-genius super professional, additional, sophisticated, illuminated, graceful, merciful ...... etc calculator.simply i could have bought dozen perfect calculator the price of this one,and CFA should not that angry. but we just have to adapt."
2,stick buttons,"Great functionality, but I give the calculator two stars for its ""sticky buttons"". It often skips numbers that are punched in fast, which can be quite frustrating."
5,Smart calculator for professionals,"I have never met quite smart and very well structured calculator like this. Very easy to use, and very smart tool for financial and investment professionals"
4,Great customer service!,I placed my ordered and it arrived next day. Unfortunately the wrong model was sent to me but after a quick return authorization on Amazon and an e-mail from the seller I received the correct model the very next day and sending back the wrong was one was easy and free. Great customer service!The calculator itself is my first financial calculator as I prep for CIPM and CFA exams. I do wish that the cover was a hard cover rather than the faux-leather simply because this won't prevent the buttons from being mashed or accidentally turned on while in my bag. Otherwise I do like the tactile feel to the buttons and I hope I don't experience the skipped inputs that others have described.
5,Great Product,The product was delivered in a quick fashion and was exactly what it said. I currently use the product in college and it serves its purpose greatly for all my business classes.
4,A regular financial calculator,"Pros:- approved by the CFA Institute as a financial calculator you can have with you on the exam;- pretty powerful, I love the TVM (time value of money) features;- decent manual.Cons:- could have been cheaper;- I don't like the touch of the buttons and I'm pretty sure they will wear out very soon. The quality of materials used is a far cry from a Casio I've been using for years.- it is not exactly intuitive, it takes a little bit of time to get used to it.To sum up: I'd probably not buy it if I didn't have to, but if you want to prepare for the CFA exam, get it as early as possible to get used to it."
5,Perfect for CFA Exam,"This calculator is perfect for the CFA exam. Easy to learn financial functions, comfortable feel and size, easy to press buttons, and a sleek silvery look. The leather case stretches to hold extra pencils and erasers. It slso has space for extra batteries, which brings me to my next point. It is 2011 now and I bought this calculator in 2008 and I stil haven't changed the battery. I study 250 hours per year for the CFA exams. Thats a ton of usage."
5,Pencil,Great pencil. Pretty Heavy duty. I bought this to get through my actuarial exams and it holds up very well. The retracting tip is fun to play with. The only thing is my hand would cramp with this pencil faster than when I used the cheaper lighter weight pencils.
4,Excellent product.,"CFA recomends this and another one which has a few features less. So, There was no point buying other models from a CFA point of view.Couple of my friends did say that some of the features can be achived using the lower version itself, but needed a few extra key strokes.But since the difference between the two was less, and I decided to be safe than sorry. If I did not use a feature then I dont lose anything , but If I need the feature and did not have it then I would be in trouble.Also some books did use this calc for explaining how to use it, since I had the books, I bought the calc to go with them.I have been using it for a month now and I am comfortable with it."
4,Ultra,"After reading this and the equally compelling (but completely different) ""Girls,"" I have become a die hard Luna Brothers fanatic. Not only is the book stylish and cool, but very insightful, human, and FUNNY. My only complaint about this series is that it didn't run for five years, because I grew to really love the characters."
3,"Good comic, but very poor product","The comic book is very good: the writing and artwork are top notch, to be sure, but the quality of the binding is HORRIBLE! Upon trying to read this for the very first time, the pages all fell apart in the first 20 minutes. The glue in question is an atrocious one, and as a result, the pages and the cover are in pieces now. I suppose the other option would be to buy the Hard Cover Deluxe version of this, but that one is simply too expensive, and honestly, just because it's a Soft Cover book, the binding should not be this poor. A big F for the publisher and their print house."
4,Very useful...,"If you like stacking your food to make your plating wow people, these rings will help. They're made with a high quality material and can be easily washed by hand. Works well for cold and hot plating."
3,reversing diabetes cookbook,"Have not made all the recipes but looks easy enough until I read the recommended key ingredient was a sugar substitute that I had to order on line, (xylitol). Brown rice syrup is also hard to find that was in a lot of ingredients."
5,Food allergy friendly!,This book is also great if you have peanut or soy allergies. I have a 7 year old who is allergic to peanuts and soy and there are many reacipes in here including desserts that are just for him! He was so excited!
1,A Hogwash...,"I foudn this book not to be practical, there was a lot of claim on the expirement and their succes however they do not reveal the real truth behind there success. It is a marketing book for them to sell you their 30 days full retreat services for an exorbitant price.Its so not worth it.... I got scammed"
4,easy recepies,this book is easy to follow and I was able to get the sugar substitute at the local health food store.color pictures of the completed food would be nice.
4,Diabetes Cooking,"This book was helpful when learning how to cook for family and friend with diabetes, thanks it help alot and my husband loves the recipes...."
1,incomplete nutrition values,"I was looking into buying this and noticed that in the nutrition facts, it doesn't mention the sugar content in a serving. Even for things that had brown rice syrup or blueberries there was no mention of sugar content. How can we make educated choices about food without that key nutrient value?"
2,Overrated...,"This chick is overrated. Yes, she can play the piano, yes she can sing, but I just don't feel her. There is an insincerity and a ""trying to hard to write a song"" feel. The songs don't feel like they came from her soul, but rather her ""brain."" I know she has a lot of fans, and I am not questioning her talent, she just lacks soul."
3,"Good, not great...","Vienna Teng's first album (Waking Hour) floored me with its breadth of musical expression and mature lyrics. I've been listening to it for over 6 months now and still haven't tired of it. A beautiful piece of work that seemed to have melded the creative talents of the whole band.""Warm Strangers"" is a decent follow-up to her debut, but it doesn't have the same range of intensity she show-cased in her first album. In many ways ""Warm Strangers"" sounds more like a solo attempt, with most of the focus on Vienna's piano and singing. Perhaps this is due to the subtle changes in the band line-up (the electric guitarist and percussionist from the 1st album are absent) or maybe it's the change in mixing & production personnel. Whatever the reason, I find ""Warm Strangers"" a good album, but it pales in comparison to ""Waking Hour""."
4,Melodic stranger,"Vienna Teng has played piano since she was 5, her parents say she sang before she talked. That kind of love of music is embodied in every one of these songs. The simplicity of the instrumentation reminds me of Nora Jones. Her heartfelt lyrics carry the songs to a deeper level. Give this a listen - I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,Green Island Serenade,"As Chinese, I am not interested in the English songs in the album. But her rendition of Green Island Serenade is simply the best among different versions that I have listened to recently...."
3,Kettle is small but quality is good.,"First, I want to say that the quality of this kettle is very good. It is very lightweight, the lid fits tightly, and it would be great for 1 or 2 people to take backpacking. However, the specs are a bit misleading. While it is true that the kettle holds 30.4 oz, this is with the water right up to the rim, to the point that you can't get the lid on without spilling some water out. Even if you were to just put 28 oz in this kettle and acutally try to boil it, I'm betting the water would start flowing out of the spout rather quickly. The kettle is only 6"" dia and 2.2""H so that may give you a better idea of the physical size. Good for 1-3 cups of hot water but nothing more."
1,vTech 15871,"The vTech i5871 has been featured in the movie 'When a Stranger Calls' and on a few prime-time shows namely, 'Brothers and Sisters'. Unfortunately the phone is horrible!Errors messages include the following ""unable to connect"", ""searching for base""."
4,Cool Phone,"It's definitely a looker. It's a practical phone as well with good volume on both the speakerphone and regular calls. Uploading pictures for Caller ID is a breeze via USB and PC. Only bad thing is that the battery could have been a little better, but good enough especially if you have two of these phones in a household."
4,Cool phone,"When the phone rings we not only see the number of our friend but also a picture, makes it even easier to screen calls."
3,Shortness of battery life,It's very frustrating that you can only talk for about 10 mins. before the battery dies and you are cut off and have to put it back on the charger
4,Reveiw of VTech 15808 Handest,"Have several. Only complain, the color graphics on the screen are not as bold as on my other handsets. Not important enough to return the phone. Love the slim lines of the phone and the features in intercoming the other handsets."
2,Vtech I5808 Full Color Accessory HAndset/Picture Caller ID,Got the phone condition is great although they say it's tested and it will not sync to the main base called tech and the can't get it to work what should I do?
4,High Quality. High Style.,"RECOMMENDED: 8/10I like this system a lot. I've had it for years. It functions well. great Range. Great sound qualtiy. Musical ringtones are great. super customizable. Unique photos for unique callers. Decent color LCDs for a home handset. The software on the handset is more advanced & EASIER TO USE than most house phones I've seen or used. Durable... the metal enclosure looks sharp and is tough. Very good HUGE & loud speaker on the handset. Base station works well and is intuitive. I left one handset in a rainstorm for 2 days. Dried it out, replaced the battery and it works like new. Could be smaller in size overall."
3,"nice looking, but!","battery life is very poor/replacement batteries from v-tech are only about $6 w/shiipping. customer service is pretty poor. all five phones died in less than a year batteries fixed that but, the phones lost a vast majority of their usable distance! v-tech solution was to give me 15% off a new phone system! hum! phones died in less than a year & know i should by another one of your phone systems w/a whopping 15% off! don't think so. phones also fall of the base from a small breeze. look else where!"
3,sounds great- the best,"Really good sound. I already have box set and Country Music Hall of Fame cd, but this was worth it just for the remastering."
4,Ships lurking on the horizon,"My 20 month old son loves this video, however, he is so frightened by the ships sequence that I have to stop the tape and fast forward it. Has anyone else had a similar experience? My son gets a kick out of the padding pool scene because he loves getting wet. Ned is a riot as he goes about trying to fix his bike."
5,My daughter loves it!,"My 21 month daughter cannot get enough of this video. She dances and sings and puts her hat on and runs around the house like Dipsy. She'll grab her plastic hammer and ""mend"" her bike like Ned (whom she adores)and wants to watch over and over. I can get dinner ready and know that she's thoroughly entertained."
2,Legendary!,Love it !!!! Not only is Bob Marley a legend he was also a revolutionary leader and started one of the greatest movements ever!
4,Well it's Bob,"He's smoking a doobie. He's Bob Marley. His eyes are closed. I suppose you already know whether or not you want to buy this poster, but I should add that this poster is not the poster that you're going to frame and show off to the new neighbors when you buy your second home. It will get you through college, however."
5,lazy town it's awsome for kids who love to dance.,"Hi,Well i have a four year old grandchild who is energetic..she dances, and is always on the go. So when we discover on tv ""lazy town"", that was it, she love the music and stephenies dancing. She even goes to the computers and with my help found ""lazy town"" with music of all kind. this year of 2011 holloween, she will be stephenie...from head to toes..LOL. so I found this christmas one and I myself check it out it's perfect for morning christmas day....so get it and enjoy."
2,to small,paint chipped of leg and very small wasent happy with product and picture made product look alot bigger and better
2,Just ok,"I purchased this book thinking it would have a lot of diagrams and ideas to keep my grand children occupied. It mostly involves games that all parents and grandparents already know, and very obvious things like finger play, pulling tissues out of a box and that sort of thing. I found it tedious to read, and actually boring somewhat."
4,"Fun book, good price","This is a fun book for stay-at-home moms, who have pulled out every trick in their hat (at least 10 times) or just for people who are looking for activities to do with the youngsters. The activities are easy to prepare for and some kept my daughter entertained for a long while. Make sure you stock up on supplies ahead of time though!"
4,"Longer Book For The Same Price, But Series Slows","This book collects issues 11 to 17 of the series, offering seven issues for the same price as the first two five-issue volumes. Unfortunately, the plot moves slower than before, including a guest-penciled two-issue 'Comedy and Tragedy' sidebar about a traveling theater troupe in a small Nebraska town. I'll hope for an improvement in the simulaneously purchased Book 4 before continuing with Book 5."
3,Very thin plot.,"I kept wondering why Yoricks mother would betray him, she must have know that if the Israelis got him she would never see him again. And why would the Israelis try to kill the astronauts, it almost felt Anti-Semitic it was so irrational. Very weak plot in this story arch.The second part of the of the book is much better though. It pokes fun at prevous issues and the characters are great. I almost wish we could forget about Yorick and focus on the troup of actors from now on."
4,Engaging and thought provoking series,"I began reading the series just a few months ago, and I'm hooked. Only reason I haven't yet read every volume is that I struggle for funding to support my reading habits! Whether good, bad, strong, weak, or just plain crazy, the characters are each developed with care and distinction to make their interactions in this unique world all the more gripping. Read!"
3,"jack smith sings jack, jack, jack","I basically bought this cd because of one song called ""Civilization"". For many years one of my best friends would always sing it and I thought I would suprise her and try to find it. After extensive searching on the internet I found it on Amazon. She said it was the best christmas present ever. This song came out in I believe 1947 and was a top song on the hit parade. She plays this song every day. Thanks Amazon"
4,Objective,"This is not a warm fuzzy, feel good, faith promoting book. It is a fair, objective, social science aproach to the LDS church."
2,These retain too much water,I bought these as part of my swimming gear. I keep them at the side of the pool and usually drive back home with them on.These have a pattern with small holes and two layers of material. When I get out of the pool they get soaked and retain an incredible amount of water. They keep your feet wet for hours if you wear them after coming out of the pool.I am very disappointed at this product.
3,mediocre at best,"Moynihan presents an array of anecdotal evidence of instances where secrecy produced unintended, and unfortunate results, and draws that sweeping conclusion that secrecy is bad. A more modest conclusion, such as that the government designates too much stuff as secret might be supported, but Moynihan's generalization is too much. Also, the introduction to the book written by Richard Gid Powers far outshines the portion written by Moynihan. Moynihan's stuff is a dry as dust."
4,"Enjoyable, informative biography","Queen Victoria had some very interesting relatives! This is the biography of one of her namesake granddaughters; the second daughter of Victoria's son, Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh-Coburg, and sister to Queen Marie of Roumania. It's a well written biography, and what a life she had. A very tragic life, really; Victoria Melita married twice (both marriages ended badly, though she stayed married to her second husband until her death); she lost her little daughter by the Grand Duke of Hesse (who was another grandson of Queen Victoria's), and the Russian Revolution swept away everything else... I enjoyed this biography very much. I thought Van der Kiste's writing was stronger here than in ""Once a Grand Duchess""."
1,Journeymen of Fantasy,"This is the worst book of fantasy short stories I ever read. There are possibly 2 masters here, Norton and Wurts; Lackey is ok for young adults and Moon's story is good. The rest of these authors never got past journeyman status."
4,Ennis and McCrea Strike Again,"The always excellent Garth Ennis and John McCrea strike again with another fine addition to the Hitman storyline. As with most of Ennis' work, this piece is violent, over the top, and of course, hysterical. John McCrea also does a great job with the art, which provides a more comical flare to Ennis' already hysterical writing. The story picks up right after the Hitman: Local Heroes story and it would be advisable to read the previous Hitman trade paperbacks before picking up this one. If you are a fan of Garth Ennis, this offering will not dissapoint!"
3,"For Flavor YES, For Heat... Nah","The flavor on these little suckers is great, but there isn't a HEAT. More of a warmth. I ate a few of these out of the jar and was surprised to find how mild they are. However, I do like to incorporate these into recipes with other peppers because I find that they add some good depth and help to round out the heat in a spicy dish."
5,Simply the best,"These peppers simply outclass the dry reds and the flakes in your spice rack. The ""heat"" is subtle as opposed to the direct and high heat of other red pepper products. Try them with your next Italian recipe."
4,The best of Toto,"This album contains a collection of the best Toto songs, including the classic hits as well as 4 new songs recorded in 1990. These 4 new songs are co-written by Jean-Michael Byron, who only appeared on the Past to Present album as Toto's new vocalist. I cannot understand why Byron was chosen to sing in one of the world's best band - his voice cannot compete with Joseph Williams, Bobby Kimball or Steve Lukather. And I can't find the reason why they dropped ""Goin' Home"" and put ""Love Has The Power"" or ""Animal"" on the album. But the other two new songs, ""Out Of Love"" and ""Can You Hear What I'm Saying"" are both listenable. Especially ""Can You Hear What I'm Saying"", which features an outstanding performance by Michael Porcaro on bass guitar. There's no need to judge the other songs on the album; have a look at the tracklist above, and you'll be persuaded to buy ""Past to Present""..."
5,Past to Present 1977,"The best to Toto is on this CD. This CD has their best; although, it doesn't have ""I'll Supply the Love."" I don't know if there could be a sound difference between the non-Gold and this CD, but the Gold look makes it look even better. Overall I would recommend this CD to anyone."
1,May gain a few muscles carrying it around BUT...,"thats all you will get from this book. I was forced to purchase this book for a programming class and found that this book by far, has to be the worst book ever! If you are looking for sample code, you wont find it here. The industry standard for programming books normally follows: 1) concept is introduced, then 2) the code is given to show the implementation of the concept.HOWEVER: this book will go into detail for about 3 or 4 paragraphs on a concept, then show you three lines of code. A similar scenario: Hey, let me describe my girlfriend to you - she is beautiful, long hair, etc, etc, then i draw a stick figure on a sheet of paper ... and you are supposed to completely understand how she looks and is as a person. Cant be done! (That was ME being SARCASTIC!) Just dont waste your time with this book. Period."
2,CD unavailable,"The book is typically QUE--fair to acceptable content. However, there is no CD included, only a website address. However, the files are no longer available there. Worse--they did not answer the email response for clarification.If your other customers are like me and appreciate the CD I would steer clear of this book. (This publisher?)"
2,Not a special book!,"This book covers a wide range of VB but just introduces each topic with a narrow extend. I bought it because of the title 'Special Edition' and I think I can learn much from it.The programming listings are poor. The programs are mostly stand-alone procedures and you cannot test them. How can the reader understand the meaning of the programs?It teaches programming with several lines each chapter. You just learn some brief descriptions to the topics. Only one topic is more practical: Appendix B Packaging your applications teaches you to create a Setup.exe.If I am a beginner, I think 'Using' series is better. If I am an Intermediate, I may choose 'Platinum Edition' series(quite similar with Special Edition'). I don't why the QUE want to print this book.If you want to learn more specific topics, try other books! You don't know what you've learned and what you can write after reading the whole book. Worthless!"
2,Just an overview - no meat,I was disappointed with this book. It's a very thin overview of Visual Basic - and the writing style is dry.
4,"well written, easy to understand","This book is well written, easy to understand, and does a good job presenting the basics of VB. It covers a lot of areas but doesn't get into too much detail in any one area. I found very few errors in the text of the book. It came up short in a few areas, however. Many of the control icons shown in the page margins are incorrect. The cover indicates ""Source code available on the Web!"" but much of the source code is either missing or incorrectly indexed. Despite these drawbacks I still would recommend getting this book."
1,I'm just a bit embarassed,I was actually an extra in this movie (my one line was cut!). It's pretty bad but is a nice little early 80s snapshot of the kind of Stray Cats vs. Duran Duran thing that was happening at the time. My highlight in the filming was when the producer's wife (Charlie's Angel Cheryl Ladd) was on the set. The Ruth Gordon scenes were flown in. She was never on the set. They just recruited a lot of us from the punk club in Atlanta (688) and Pia had a couple of us kicked out. Mindless.
5,"Honest, Moving and Memorable","I wanted to read this book because the author was born in the same city I was born in, Nha Trang. I was curious to find out what happened after the Vietnam War ended, especially since my family never talks about their own experiences there. After reading this memoir, I was deeply moved by its honest portrayal of the day-to-day life for the people who lived under the Communists. At first, I myself did not believe that these events actually happened. Only when I asked my own family, did it occur to me that the events in this memoir are a vivid painting of how it really was living in Vietnam in the years that followed the war. Because of this novel and my curiosity, my family has been pouring me with endless amounts of stories about their experiences, most of which are exactly what the author of The Unwanted talks about. Therefore, I highly recommend this book, particulary to those, like myself, who might be curious to know what happened in Vietnam after the war ended."
4,"Spare and honest; poignant story of Vietnam, post war","Written in a spare and straightforward style that suits the horrific and lush backdrop of post-fall-of-Saigon war years, The Unwanted is Nguyen's story of his childhood as a hated Amerasian, the illegitimabe child of an American GI and a wealthy Vietnamese woman. Focusing on the decade after Saigon fell and ending with his emigration to the United States when he was 18, the author documents the crazy shifts in his life from one of privilege before the age of 8, to one of pathos and fear under the Communists, when the whole social order was reversed and his family was at risk of losing everything, including their lives. Now a dentist in the US, Nguyen initially penned his memoir as a self-healing attempt to overcome the many scars of his difficult childhood. It is fortunate for his readers that he decided to seek publication."
5,I have this book in my hands.,"Today, i was hurrying to the library before it closes so i can at least get something.. Then something caught my eye as i fasteye search for a good title. Then i saw this book,The Unwanted, at first i thought this book looks abit simple since, because of the huge boy pict. This book quickly reminded me of Angelas ashes. At first when i took this book home..i didnt know if this book will be good or not. But after reading all the reviews praising the author ...I cant wait till i turn off this comp and start reading. (in the middle of the night)Im guessing if i can or cannot put this book down.In my opinion...Memoirs of Geisha....not truly a memoir...because mostly about her job of being a Geisha. This book dont have deep, scar thoughts on my brain.Im older than 12.........since dont want to go through email thing."
3,"Amazing story, less than amazing story-telling","This author has an amazing story to tell of his life. I won't spoil any of it to say any more than what the book summary gives it. However, I got the impression he was both pretentious and jaded in telling the story. Quite frankly, that ruined the book for me because I kept seeing how it's left him, which didn't need a whole book to state. I think there were ways of telling this remarkable story that could have sounded more reflective and neutral in the sense of not having to ""pump it up"" to be something more. I don't think it needed that to be remarkable at all. Also, a few places does make me question if this was made over some how since it seemed to all fit together a little too perfectly. Anyway, a 3 stars average for a remarkable story but less than good writing."
5,Poignant and Unforgettable,"This story was so engaging, I finished the book in one sitting. It offers many insights into the living conditions and struggles of those still left in Vietnam after the fall of Saigon. After reading this book, I felt very thankful to be alive and appreciate the daily comforts that I take for granted.I cried through several passages of this book. The abuse and humiliation that Kien Nguyen had to endure while growing up as an Amerasian in post-war Vietnam was so unjust. Even though these events have shaped who he is today, they have left a lot of scars. Despite the obstacles, this story reminds us of the strength of the human spirit and our ability to overcome incredible hardships. I admire Kien Nguyen's courage to share such an incredible story."
5,A Vietnam Vet Loves This Book,"I was in Vietnam in 1969 and 1970. I lived on The Cambodian Border, spoke Vietnamese and conducted military operations with them. This book is the most moving book about the Vietnamese that I have ever read. Mr. Nguyen captures the struggles, the difficulties and the adversities that they faced and overcame. I could not put it down and the book has never left me......it is extraordinary. I would rank it right up there with the very best books written on Vietnam. I await his new book, "" The Tapestries"", which is to be released in October with great anticipation. Mr. Nguyen is a young man who is making a serious mark on the American literary scene and has a great future ahead of him. A master story teller who has captured his life's experience so vividly that it will never leave you, as it never left me."
5,A Great Read,I could not put this book down! I read a lot of nonfiction and this is one of the best.
5,great product,I am very pleased with my refillable ink cartridge. Shipping was fast and the product works great!! Thanks
4,recycled version,"Hey buy the re manufactured version from Enviro-Links out of Austin Tx. The price was great, the product works fine and the shipping was very quick"
2,Ink cartridges near expiration date,"Supplier sent cartridges with a September 2013 expiration date with no warning in the ad that this was the case. At the rate we use ink, we'll be just past the expiration date when we use the first cartridge and more than a year past expiration when we use the second cartridge. I think Amazon should require outside vendors to disclose the expiration dates."
2,PRINT PRINT PRINT,Came just in time. A couple bucks less then the store. It was only worth it because I was not going to run out soon. If I need ink soon I would not go this route because the few bucks less is really not worth it.
4,this was a Cool Get together,I had heard this Set many years ago&it was cool for Everybody coming together on here.it's a Pretty Good Set though not as Essential as JB Live in the 60's&Early 70's but still a Cool Overview on The GODFATHER!!!
4,Practical Guide to Everyday uses of Meditation,"Great book for both the novice and well healed meditator. This book has introduced me to new ways and places to meditate. Whether to create calm before the day starts over a cup of coffee or peace before visiting the in laws. This book is well written, sucinct and practical in its guide to where and how to meditate. Its not about sitting for 6 hours and struggling to lose oneself. It is finding oneself in the flow of the every day. Bravo."
5,"A strong, endearing story","This is an emotional book, primarily about a woman, Meg, trying to come to grips with the unexpected suicide of her teenage son. She is haunted by not knowing why he did it. The story points out the fact parents often think they know their kids, when they don't. It also explores the reaction of other family members. Meg's husband and daughter. The conclusion deals with Meg coming to terms with the reason her son killed himself also how she saves her husband a lifetime of grief, which I thought made a heroine of her."
4,Someone For You !,"This was a wonderful story one that touched by heart ! After talking about this story, 15 people that I know have now bought this book ! Check out Someone Like You and see if you agree ! Blythe touched my heart and I was sure hoping she would not let Khalil get away ! After going thru ups and downs in a relationship going no where .She finally meets Khalil ! Is he the one for her? It was hard for her to tell but the writing was on the wall ! Was she going to see it or let Khalil get away ! I also wondered about Blythe's mother ! Did she really love her daughter or was it she just did not know how to show it ! What happened the night of the accident after the arguement between her parents ! What about the time her mother caught her father in his office with another woman ! Yes you have got to read this one to find the answers ! What about that Fashion designer Alda she had those style working at the fashion show during the Kawanza celecbration ! Check this one out for sure !"
4,Nice Read!!,I really enjoyed reading this story. I am a big fan of Thomas. She really has great writing talent that is displayed in all of her work. And Blythe and Khalil's story was no exception! And any book that expresses unique holidays or cultural beliefs are always good! In this book Thomas's characters celebrates the Kwanzzaa holiday or belief. Very nice read!
3,Tea Choice,If you drink a lot of tea and your palate is not attuned to the more delicate nuances of flavor. This tea is for you. It is a good solid full-bodied tea with bold flavor not masked by milk and or sweeteners. Personally I use a little rum or brandy on those cold dreary mornings and this tea shines.
2,"Weak! Conjecture, hyperbole and more...","If you are looking for a ""future shock"" or ""infotainment"" type of book or have already decided that deflation is forthcoming and are looking for an affirmation of your point of view, this book is for you. If you are looking for a book which explains deflation in an analytical context; i.e., causality, the present situation, and possible future outcomes, this book is definitely not for you. The author's credentials don't seem to match the book at all. I thought a rating of ""2 stars"" was fair since the book was reasonably well-written and did not contain obvious factual errors (in part, because the book had very few facts in it)."
3,Out of date,"This is a good book, but it is in need of a serious rewrite. Originally published in 1999, it misses the following events:* Stock market calamity in 3/2000 and subsequent decline* 9/11* corporate accounting scandals* The multitude of interest rate cuts* Real Estate bubble* War on IraqAs a result, a lot of the information in this book has to be interpreted with these events in mind. For instance, a whole chapter is devoted to ""The Strengthening Dollar"" - which may have happened had the landscape not changed so drastically. Another example is a mention of Enron as an example of a company that might be a winner in the electric utility industry as utilities are being deregulated.The above is not intended to be a slight on the author or the book. Who could've foreseen the events above? The point is that the landscape has changed a lot since this book was originally written."
1,I agree with P. Lucas,"These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these ""thin crisps"" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones."
1,these ain't oreo's,"These things are low cal oreo's: minus the creme, minus the cookie! The title ""oreo"" is basically a total misnomer. These are nothing but black crackers with some sugar. If that is what you want, then click purchase."
5,Oreo Crisps,"Nabisco knew if they didnt put little things that give this much pleasure in little baglets, we would keep dipping our hand in the bag and in a couple years would all weigh 400 lbs, die an early death and no longer be able to give Nabisco money.Kidding aside, these are loveable. The texture is perfection. If you feel like chewing them quickly or take it slowly and let the light wafer melt in your mouth."
3,Not impressed,"Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre."
3,3.5* snack for a non-chocophile,"It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea. They taste okay to me. A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO. Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers. They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar. The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much. So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package. Not easy to do if you're hungry. Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives. Could also tide you over between meals. Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier. But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!"
4,Good cockatiel book,"I enjoyed the photos he included of cockatiels in the wild and what their habitat looks like. I have not found this in other cockatiel books. He was informative on how to care for a pet cockatiel and I appreciated that he mainly talked about a seed diet, instead of a pellet diet. I think seeds are the natural diet for cockatiels, not man made pellets!"
2,Stinks,"This guy is wierd,I don't think he's owned a cockatiel in his life!! Not for the first time bird owner because of all the false info. Why 2 stars? It does have a few helpful tips and some cute pictures.OK to have on your shelf but your going to want a better one soon.(Don't buy his lovebird book either}"
2,CHEAP FABRICATION,"Cheap thin cotton velvet fabric,made in China, cheap itchy band inside. Does not stretch. Size medium. fits up to size 7 1/4, but doesn't stretch, so not comfortable. I do not recommend this hat."
4,Very nice for the price,I like this item very much. The material is a little thinner than I would have liked but considering the price I think it is a good deal. It fits perfectly and looks good worn in a variety of different ways. I am going to dress mine up with some lace and an old piece of jewelry and I think it will be a favorite hat of mine. I am pleased with my purchase.
2,"Avoid this ""Comedy""","Had the misfortune of watching this movie the other night. Not funny in the least, although some of the characters are quirky enough to maintain interest if you've got nothing else to do/watch. Jeremy Piven is at the root of this film's failure. He's not a comedian, and there is little about his performance that compels viewers to keep watching. I would have given this film one star but for Will Ferrell's hilarious five minute cameo in the film."
2,It goes too far...,"This movie has a good premise, but it went places it shouldn't have. It becomes a bit insulting after awhile. That's too bad, because the idea is good, just not the execution."
2,Waste of money,I rented this from Amazon on Demand. It wasn't even slightly funny. We were very disappointed after watching it and we hadn't even cracked a smile at any of it.
2,Impressive Cast Leaves Its A-Game at Home,"Simple fun, with a few legitimately hilarious moments, The Goods never quite manages to reach the point of becoming an honest success story. A thin plot routinely sets the mood for great payoffs, but then proceeds to miss ever-so-slightly with the punchline, like it knows how to be funny but is afraid to fully commit. It boasts a tremendous cast of supporting actors, drawn from no less than a dozen genuine classics, but Jeremy Piven fails once again to graduate into a reliable lead and that front-office vacancy leaves the picture feeling hollow. A grab bag of potentially funny ideas and situations that don't always deliver, it's the kind of flick you might expect to catch on Comedy Central at 3AM. Very similar to Wet Hot American Summer in that respect."
1,"Worst Movie, EVER!","Seriously, this is a bad movie. I can't think of a single redeeming quality. Horrible.=C="
4,"The Goods : Live Hard, Sell Hard - Laugh","I had seen the trailer for this movie before it was released. I knew that I wanted to see it. I ordered my DVD copy from Amazon straight away. It still has not been released in Australia.I would have one of the first copies I am sure.Very funny and just like you would expect on a sale weekend in a motor dealership.You could draw comparisons to Suckers a similar type movie but this was done without the extra emphasis on using sex to sell the movie.As a senior executive in the motor industry I could remember this happening in the ""Old Days"".I am sure this would not offend anyone and find it very entertaining.Recommended for all."
4,Great for car people,This is a funny movie but I don't know if non-car people would enjoy it as much. Don't even think about buying this to want watch on a portable video player. The copy protection is a bear.
1,Bad Product,"Video was sold as ""new"". Arrived in cellophane wrapping, but while playing the dvd, it stopped 3/4 of the way through the movie. I do not believe it was a new movie and I could not finish the movie."
4,"Better than ""The Hangover""...","If you are looking for something with solid laughs, this one never fails to entertain. And if you don't mind a little raunch with your comedy, ""The Goods"" really sells. Jeremy Piven does a great turn as the unlikable/likable hero who turns a car dealership destined for failure into a profitable venture. He and his gang of aggressive salespeople really fill out a film that delivers. I have seen this twice and caught myself laughing at all the right moments. This is 'in your face' comedy that is unapologetic. Don't see it if you are easily turned off by crude humor."
2,Pretty weak,"Not sure Hollywood knows how to be funny anymore. It seems about 1 in 20 comedys actually provide more than 3 good laughs. Toilet humor is fine, but an hour and 23 minutes of it?I picked up this movie because the previews were funny. In the typical Hollywood fashion, those trailer scenes ended up being the only funny ones.Save your rental fee."
1,Basically an awful attempt to reinvent Anchorman,"Not funny, not interesting, and not worth your time. This movie can only be described as being some awful attempt at taking the the humor from Anchorman (idiotic and over-the-top, but still funny) and trying to make it work with used car salesmen. The storyline is pathetic, and you notice this right off the bat. Within 10 minutes Piven gives some pointless speech on an airplane that ends is cheers from the passengers and him motorboating the stewardess - believe, my summary of that scene is ten times funnier than actually watching it. Plus, as usual, Piven simply tries to play ""Ari"" as this is his only talent. Oh, and his female sidekick is nicknamed ""Babs"", just like his business partner in Entourage. Don't waste your time renting this, let alone buying it. I only gave it a shot using a free rental code from Red Box, and I'm still upset that I wasted an hour of my life before turning it off without seeing the finish."
1,Waste of 1 1/2 hours,"Thank God it was a RedBox rental. Despite what appears to be a good cast ( although my low opinion of Piven descended even further), this is a classic example of a movie with the thinnest of 'plots"", bad writing, and actors going through the motions. Just bloody awful. As an earlier reviewer stated, this steaming pile doesn't compare with the very good 'Used Cars"", with Kurt Russell, etc.Don't waste your time, or money, on this wretched excuse for a movie, the cinematic equivalent of a used Yugo."
1,deserves negative stars,This movie was made by a 10 year old in a 30 year old body .Total and complete garbage . Not funny at all .But can someone recommend another movie with lots of strippers in it ?Thanks .
1,The Bads,This movie tries too hard with the crude stuff. It just seems forced. There are a few funny parts but it is basically just stupid.
3,Decent Piven fix,"This movie was just OK, but it was nice to get a Jeremy Piven fix while between seasons of Entourage."
3,B movie funny,"This movie is not the greatest, but it is funny. It goes along the lines of the old 1980 movie Used Cars. It has its moments. There is raciest seen in there and some stupid stuff like eating a regular meal in a strip club. Or them being able to violate the FAA rules and turning the airplane into a party plane. I was all for comedy, but it was a little much. The Boy Band stuff was pure 80's and if this movie had came out closer to that time period I think it would have done better. Most people of that time period wouldn't have come to this movie so I think some of the innuendos were lost."
3,Don't expect too much & you won't be disappointed,"Ok, this is not a 5 star movie and it would be silly to pretend otherwise. But, it is generally funny. Some jokes are lame, others vulgar, and some are actually good. The premise is unimportant (all you need to know is that it's about car sales, saving a struggling used car lot, blah blah blah--seriously, it doesn't matter). It's just a movie with a string of jokes coming from a very eclectic group of characters. And Will Ferrell's scene is pretty funny. I gave this movie a 3 (Amazon defines as ""ok"") which seems fair. It isn't oscar-worthy but is perfect if you're looking for a comedy and you want nothing more than to be amused."
2,Weight Issues,"My issue with this product was that, with the filter in place, the spray head was too top heavy for the ball joint. It would slowly fall down until the sprayer faced straight down.The overall make-up of the shower head was decent. The spray modes were lacking a bit; the modes would blend together.Overall, the idea and the head are good for the price. But don't use the provide coupler. It will fail and you'll have to hold the sprayer all the time."
2,Tooooo heavy.....,"Culligan makes good products and the showerhead is obviously very well constructed, the problem is, is too heavy. So much so that there is no shower holder that will hold it up. I was manipulating it and it fell on my face and I now have a very fat lip. The shower with the cartridge inside weighs almost 2 lbs. So be careful with buying this and know what you are getting in to."
1,Broke after three weeks.,"This showerhead never really ""sat"" right in the shower. The added weight from the internal filter makes the showerhead droop once it is filled with water, as the plastic mount does not support it's weight. Could never get a tight enough seal between the actual head and the hose to make it stop spraying water, which should have been a warning sign, and three weeks after buying it, it breaks at the handle! Thanks, Amazon, for covering my return shipping.Do not buy this, you will regret it."
1,Not that great,Product hands funny the items hangs down instead of spraying at you it would hang over your head and won't stay still. I returned it.
2,The shower head is too heavy!,"This shower head is too heavy and it just flops down when you put it in the shower grip. I had to tie it with a piece of string so that it would hold up when I shower. This is a bad design flaw. As for the water quality, up until now I haven't seen any difference to my skin or hair. Only time will tell wether the filter is any good. Dissapointing purchase so far."
2,Good shower head bad holder,"When we received the shower head it was easy to assemble and to install, however the shower head holder keeps moving downwards because the shoer head is to heavy. I am calling a friend to fix it if not I'm going to return it."
2,"Good filter, shower head could be better designed","Shower head mounting bracket broke after a few months of use rendering it useless. Mounting bracket is chrome ""finished"" plastic which finally gave away with a few months of use."
2,Flimsy hardware,"As some have stated before, the plastic adapter, that sits between the shower pipe coming out of the wall and the hose, is very flimsy. Mine cracked while installing it, part way through the first turn. I'm fortunate that the metal adapter from my non-filtered hand-help shower head had the same size connections, saved me the hassle of having to ship this one back."
3,GARBAGE!! (UPDATE - Read Review),"Horrible. Connector made of plastic. Cracks after prolonged time. Called Culligan. Sent me a new part. That cracked after a few months. Is it so hard Culligan to make it with another material???UPDATE - 02/21/12Called Technical Support - Guess what? They discovered a new material to make the part out of Zinc and no more plastic. In fact they sent me the new replacement. It is clearly newly designed and no more cheap plastic. Hopefully this one will last but only time will tell.Note - To avoid having the shower head fall down upon placing it in it's holder, put a towel around the connector and Monkey Wrench it tight! But be careful.... Even Zinc can crack.....Revising my stars to 3. If this lasts more then a few months I'll be back to give it one more star."
1,mounting bracket quality is not what 5-year warranty would imply,"I don't really care about filtering aspect of this product if the product can't be used properly due to cheaply made mounting parts. as many of the reviews on here have said, the mounting bracket that connects the shower head holder to the pipe is poorly made and is likely to break within a couple of months (as it did for me) - the time it takes to break it probably has to do with the amount of water pressure in the pipe, but it will break eventually given the quality of the plastic used to make that bracket. One would think that a product that supposedly comes with a 5 year warranty won't need the type of upkeep that requires remounting it in 2 months (and not being able to shower at a time that is likely to be inopportune one for you) - instead the mounting this thing has is of the same poor quality as the cheapest chinese shower heads off ebay."
1,Poor quality fittings,"It's seldom that I write a poor review for a product since I do a lot of research before purchasing anything. This is one of the only showerheads that I could find that had a hose, and a built in filter but the fact of the matter is that the hose is the only metal component of this set-up- everything else is chrome plated plastic. I was installing the bracket that holds the showerhead to the pipe by hand but it broke while I was slowly turning it. I called the customer service department to see if I could get a replacement part sent out but I got an answering machine, I didn't want to leave a message because it's such bad customer service to send a customer to a machine so I figured they wouldn't call me back- I left one anyway and three or four days later and no call."
4,Great Product! Immediate results and easy to install.,"Just got this over the weekend, and installed it in less than five minutes. Comes with everything needed for install, including teflon tape. No tools required, just hand tighten.Had two showers with it so far, and the results are obvious. Hair feels cleaner/softer and skin is definitely less dry/flaky. Soap also seems to lather more, and washes off easier than before.I gave it 4 stars because of the plastic fittings and connections. Seems like it could easily crack, but it comes with a 5 year warranty so that shouldnt be more than a temporary nuisance if it does happen. Other than that this would have received 5* -- Also to note, having the filter right in the showerhead makes it a little heavier than most showerheads."
1,Culligan HSH-C135 Hand Held Filtered Showerhead,"The part that screw on to the pipe coming out of the shower wall will crack when tighten, it is made of Plastic. Should be made of brass. I purchased two and I am returning one. Went to the culligan site to see if I could purchase the part that cracked, could not find it, Money down the drain."
5,Showerhead,"I got one of these showerheads and love the filtered water, no chlorine smell. Had to get one for my sister, they love it."
1,absolutely the worst material,I got this model to replace my other Culligan- stay away from this one! the material is extremely bad and the connecting piece broke- the inside thread was broken after only one attempt to fit- it's very cheap plastic and it WILL break upon installation- I was extremely careful and have installed other showers- never had this problemDo yourself a favor: invest in a showerhead made with durable fitting pieces (hard to find these days...)
1,*** DO NOT BUY ***,"Product was great for 2 month! THEN IT FELL APART!!!!!! Shower head completely seperated from the hose (looked like it had been glued together to begin with) and while removing the other end of the hose the cheap plastic fitting cracked, so now my $42 purchase is now useless.On top of this Amazon has no customer service link to be found and when I click on the return an item link it said my return window has expired. Needless to say I won't be purchasing much directly from Amazon anymore, because if it breaks or the product is crappy you're pretty much stuck with it!!!!Signed,Very disappointed!!!!!!!"
1,What went wrong?,"I bought this shower head filter over 5 months ago and at first it worked great. My hair was softer, fewer breakouts on my skin....Then, it started to just trickle water out, so I figured that I needed to change the filter, which I did. Ever since then, even with the new filter in, water won't come out full-force and is MISERABLE to take a shower in. I am not sure if there are clogs or mineral build up inside where I can not clean it, but WHAT A HASSLE! I am thoroughly disappointed in this product and would not recommend it."
4,Good,"I've only had this showerhead for about a month and out of that month I've been away for 2 weeks. The times I've used it I have not seen a really big difference. I bought it because I hate it when I get out of the shower and my skin feels so itchy from all the chemicals in the water. After I installed this showerhead I did notice a little less itchiness, maybe it was a placebo effect, who knows. The showerhead was very easy to install (less than 5 minutes) and the price at amazon was the best. The filters are also very inexpensive and are supposed to last for about 6 months depending on the usage. I don't know if there is an accurate way to test how good it filters the water but for now I think it's better than nothing."
1,didn't make any noticeable difference,"didn't make any noticeable difference to my hard water. Really can't tell the difference other than a noticeable smell from the filter. Lime scale may have been reduced slightly but hard to tell at this point(purchased about a month ago). Still plenty of soap scum, no increased lather, no improvement to hair or skin. descent as a showerhead but too heavy for it's holder."
1,too heavy,I cannot get it to stay up it is too heavy for the bracket so I had to take it down and would like to return it
1,not worth it,I tried this showerhead to find that the water pressure became really slow and it was like showering outdoors on a misty day. I didn't notice any difference in my skin since I thought the filter would help reduce the amount of minerals in the water that dry out your skin.
1,Terrible Design,"The ball joint is not strong enough to support the shower head so that the showerhead points directly at the ground. Because all of the joints are cheap plastic, there is no way to tighten things enough for it to actually support the head. I should have read the reviews more carefully, this product is cheap and not worth the money."
4,"Good, but could be better","We have very hard water and I hated it after moving from a home that had a water softener installed. This filtering shower head seems to be an improvement but I haven't noticed anything dramatic just yet; time will tell. We're not crazy about the cheap plastic bracket used to hold the shower head and the weight makes it droop and point downward as some other reviewers have commented. However, I've found that once the water is turned on the pressure makes it easier to adjust and stay put so it hasn't been a big deal.I do love having the removable handle, which is why I bought this model instead of the other Culligan one that has awesome reviews but is stationary. It makes it easier to shampoo and rinse my young daughter's hair at bath time and that was worth the minor inconvenience of re-adjusting the direction for normal showers."
1,parts that hold the shower head can be break easily,"I saw others review about shower head fall off but because I care more about filtering, I ended up buying the product. However, after using 6 months, part that holding the shower ball got cracked and no longer able to use. It says 5 years warranty, so I tried to contact and I was connected to voice mail and even though I left the voice mail, they never called me back.So, if you want to use if for long term, better find other products."
3,Expected Too Much?,"I may have expected too much from this shower massage. I thought that since it's supposed to be filtered, it would feel more like a shower with soft water. I know we have extremely hard water here in the Los Angeles area so maybe it was just too hard for the filter to handle. I didn't notice any difference between this showerhead and my last one. One thing I found with this showerhead is that you MUST buy a new filter to replace the old one because the showerhead won't work without a filter in place :("
5,Softer Water for Less,"This Culligan HSH-C135 filtered handheld showerhead is very good. The materials are solid and nice. Easy to install. The best thing, it makes the water a lot softer. I can feel that my skin is less dry and itchy after every shower."
4,"Love the actual showerhead, but the connector piece broke day 1!","The showerhead is great and the filter is fantastic, however the connector piece to the shower is plastic and should be metal for sure. It cracked when I hand tightened the piece upon it's immediate installation. I am not strong by any means and have trouble opening jars sometimes, the breaking of this delicate piece is ridiculous. Waiting to hear back from Culligan about a replacement part. I emailed them a picture, but they emailed me back and said that I should just call!"
4,A Good Showerhead.,A great shower head with replaceable cartridges.I took the media out of the cartridge and replaced it with germanium pellets. ..Works wonderfully and gives a very relaxing shower.I recommend this for anyone looking for a sturdy shower head with replaceable cartridges.
4,Works Well Removing Clorine,A little expensive but it works as specified. And the filters are suppose to last 6 months. If they do then it's well worth the price.
3,Major Flaw??,"After just 3 weeks of use, the hose broke. However, it actually works excellently. Amazon replaced it and so far there aren't any further issues. I hope the first one was just a fluke. The various spray settings makes it versatile, and the filter softens the water. You actually do feel the difference the first time you try it."
2,It leaks,The hand-held shower handle is made of chrome-plated plastic. It cracks the moment I mount it on the shower inlet and water sprays out from the cracks. Requested for a replacement and experienced the same problem. I had to run out to Home Depot to buy a new shower handle.
5,Should have bought it sooner!,A snap to install. Honestly can't think of one negative thing to say about the showerhead with filter. What a difference! My hair is so soft and silky and my skin is no longer dry. I don't even need to use body lotion after a shower anymore.I'm going to buy one for the guest bathroom and one for my grandsons. Don't want those little ones exposed to all that chlorine!
1,Poor quality,"This shower head unit broke upon installation. It is not crafted from very sturdy materials, so I had to return it."
1,Poor Quality,"The weight of the showerhead was too much for the ball joint. It just kept falling straight down. I tried as much as I could to tighten it, but no luck. It's just a really cheaply made showerhead. I took the advice of a friend and didn't read the reviews here which I typically never do. Bad idea, as it looks as though others have had the same experience. I returned it and Amazon was great, as usual."
2,Could be made better,"This would be a great product if the part that connects to the shower pipe was made of metal instead of plastic. According to the instructions, you are to use a wrench to put the part on even though you are screwing plastic on to metal. I just used my hands to put the part on and it cracked (even though I used plumbers tape as instructed). I went to home depot to see if I could find a metal replacement for it, but they don't sell them. I did however find a plastic replacement which I purchased for $5. I like the product itself as my skin and hair feels better and soap lathers better, however they could have made the part that screws on to the metal shower pipe METAL instead of plastic. Poor design."
2,Useful as HAND HELD but won't stay in place in bracket,"We got this shower head this week and I should have paid closer attention to the fact that it says HAND HELD in the item name. The shower head seems to do well at filtering chlorine but we can't actually use it as a main shower head (to stand under, etc). It isn't adjustable and kind of flops downward because of gravity so unless you stand directly up against the wall, the stream doesn't go on you. We have two shower heads in our shower so we will keep it and install it on the one that never gets used but I wouldn't recommend this as the primary shower head."
4,Does its job well,"I bought this product when I developed problems with my skin after moving into the city. It was my hope that the filter would help improve this problem. Which it has. It was easy to install, has all the standard Hand-held showerhead features. It is not a low flow shower head as it has the current top end gallons per minute rate but it uses less water than my old showerhead anyway. It does its job and I would recommend it to others."
1,Poor quality,Not so bad if it lasted more than a month. I would expect at least a year. This product is poor quality and won't last long.
5,Filtered showerhead Culligan,"This works! We were used to softer water. We moved to Europe and our hair & skin turned dry & dull within 2 months. I started to use this filtered showerhead, & within 1 week, we saw a real difference! It's a very heavy head. Takes getting used to. Pressure is good. Try it!"
2,opion of plastic shower heads,"I was excited to get this item,especially after hearing that it removes chlorine. The only thing that really irratates me about this item is that the most important part is made of plastic. the part that the handle hangs on needs to be attached to the half inch pipe coming out of the wall. the part is plastic to metal. it's also undersized,which makes it crack in half. especially after you apply the tape to the metal pipe from the wall. I couldn't use it and had to use the old one,which is plastic,chinese plastic,but a little thicker Culligan should get there s**t together and do some improvement. I'm sick of chinese products. all crap !And I'm not goung to waste my time with amzon to try and order anther plastic piece of crap that's undersized. waste of time"
1,TOO HEAVY.,"HAVE USED FILTERING HANDHELD SHOWERS BEFORE BUT THIS IS A POORLY DESIGNED PRODUCT. THE HEAD IS SO HEAVY THAT WHEN IT'S ITS HOLDER THE HEAD FALLS FORWARD AND WHEN HOLDING IT IN SOAPY HANDS IT'S AWKWARD. EVEN THOUGH I'VE ONLY HAD IT A SHORT TIME, I'VE REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER BRAND."
4,NOT BAD AT ALL!,"Just watched the movie. And may I say, That I really enjoyed it! I almost didn't buy this movie because everybody was saying how bad the picture quality was. But I'm glad I gave it a shot. Now I will tell you the real deal! The video quality is NOT bad at all! That's right! I was pleasantly surprised!!! I was expecting a terrible picture, But to my surprise it wasn't bad at all! It's not A quality, But I would give it a B+. So If you are thinking about buying this movie, DO SO! Like I said before. It ain't bad!"
2,Don't say you weren't warned...,"I am no genius in Physics, but I can recognize inconsistencies when I see them. I am not even halfway through this book, and I have already found more than 23 mathematical / formulaic errors / inconsistencies that have me wondering if any editors at all even glanced at the numbers and formulas printed on each page. I give up...back to Kaplan."
4,A Good Start,"Nova's Physics Book is one of their three book The MCAT series. It is a great starting point for someone who has forgotten a lot of physics or who needs to build up his/her physics confidence. The book presents the more basic physical concepts and finishes each chapter with a quiz. The questions include passages, series of problems, and individual, stand-alone questions. They are similar to, though perhaps easier than, the MCAT.If you've already got your physics down and want to practice for the MCAT, this book is not for you. If you feel like you're not ready to attack the MCAT practice test yet, this book will help you understand the physics portion."
4,"Not bad, but","I've been using this book off and on to help me understand the physics aspect of the MCAT. I've also been using EK and Kaplan. My only complaint with this book is that the author sometimes uses numbers in his problems that are impossible to do in your head and require a calculator. He evens mentions this. A MCAT review book should prepare the student using the exact same conditions the student should expect on the real thing. Giving numbers and calculations that require a calculator to figure out angles (for example) isn't putting the student in the right mindset. Other than this, the book is excellent. Although he does occasionally skips steps in his ""step-by-step"" solutions, with a little thought, they can be figured out.Overall, I would say this book is good for figuring out concepts, but not for figuring out the quickest way to do calculations in your head, which is imperative for good mcat test-taking skills."
2,Solutions are wrong,"This book is very practically laid out and appeared to be an efficient method of studying, but for those who are actually meticulously going through each problem, you will notice many errors. A few of the solutions are mislabeled. Other mathematical formulas are not properly written or rearranged. I have ofund 4 errors in this book and I'm only on Chapter 3. And those are only the ones i have caught. I would not buy this again."
3,Solid,"Probable Cause is a straight forward police novel. The bad guys are the police. There's no fancy police investigation with dashing cops. This is a novel that would be filmed in black and white. If I didn't know the author's name, I would have sworn it was a man who wrote.It's good ."
5,My Favorite Recording,"Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben WebsterIn over forty years of playing, listening, and collecting jazz recordings, Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben Webster is my favorite. ""It Never Entered My Mind"" is a wonderful example of the contrast between the sound that Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster achieved on the tenor saxophone. It just doesn't come any better than this."
4,Reserve Affairs,"This book was extremely easy and enjoyable reading. Everything flowed from start to finish. I was disappointed that the book had to end but was delighted that it left a hint of a possible sequel. I gave it only 4 stars because of the publisher's inability to ""spell check"", otherwise GREAT BOOK !!!"
4,This book only deals with the tektite form of moldavite,"This book only talks of the Tektite form of moldavite. It does not mention the African Moldavite (a green translucent stone mined near Kilamanjaro) at all.Much of the information here about moldavite is correct, and matches my experience with Tektite moldavite. Many people are under the impression that tektite Moldavite is the most powerful stone on Earth. From my experience with 60+ different kinds of rocks in my collection; Moldavite is the second most powerful stone on earth. In April; I saw two Rainbow Boji stones that were far more powerful than any of the peices of moldavite in my collection.I did not care for the chapter of Channeling readings about moldavite. I DID find chapter 10 ""The Moldavite Letters"" very interesting because I too have noticed changes in myself in the last two months of carrying a peice of moldavite in my pocket; Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
4,informative,"Being that it's the only book on Moldavite available, it's hard to give it a fair review.I'd say that the most valuable information I found in this book was the chapter on ""using Moldavite with other stones""... It's really insightful but, unfortunately, it only covers about 15 or 20 other gemstones so it left me wanting more.still a pretty good read."
4,A transformative reading,"This book endeavors to educate about the purpose of Moldavite on Earth, according to the authors, Robert Simmons and Kathy Warner. Simmons has researched in detail regarding the speculative theories of how this stone got here on Earth, and its potential purpose for humankind's transition to our next purpose. Through personal experience and via the letters of others' experiences with Moldavite, the reader can surely recognize that there is something different about this lovely green meteorite, and it IS worth investigating. Simmons is the author of the book Earthfire, and The Book of Stones.Earthfire: A Tale of TransformationThe Book of Stones: Who They Are & What They Teach"
5,A Box That You Can'T Leave Behind,"Hi, I bought the box yesterday in a shop in Milan. I've been waiting for it since December. Now it's mine!. I think this is a funny and wonderful black and green box that contains a black embroidered t-shirt with the logo A.T.Y.C.L.B, a golden pin, a mouse pad and the limited version of A.T.Y.C.L.B. cd! If you are a collector and you have the money to buy it, you'd be better go and run worldwide to find it. As soon as possible 'cause it's a limited issue of 1000. Once you've got it, you can go proud of it and one day ... you can tell your son: 'Hey son, you're a lucky boy. This box is for you. U2 are the best rock band ever in the world and you've got something special of them!. Enjoy U2!'. Ciao."
3,Who you callin' Fink?,"I've always thought Bernarda Fink was a fabulous singer, but I never realized that she composed ""Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria""! For going on four centuries, Claudio Monteverdi has unfairly copped the credit, and it's about time justice was done."
4,worth it,Whether you want to start collecting old movies or just want some extra movies around for when your bored this set is a steal. Where are you going to get this many movies with these classic stars at this price?
5,Annja Creed in Senegal,The location of this story alternates between The United States and Senegal and hinges on the slave trade. Annja is a well known archaeologist and her team discovers a magic stone that is also the object of desire of a very cruel warlord in Senegal. As a formidable enemy he comes after her but Annja has magic powers that hopefully will allow her to defeat him (or not ?)
1,Rogue Angel Series,"Bad unless you like fight books with no plot. The first book in the series was great--lots of action, well defined characters and room for the people in it to grow relationships and lives--and I bought books two and three looking forward to many hours of pleasure. I read the second book. It was nothing but fighting, no plot, no growth of her characters. She falls from one fight into another with hardly no time to breathe in between. I didn't bother with the third book at all. I simply contacted Amazon and had them remove the books permanently from my Kindle. If they had been paperbacks, I would have thrown them in the fireplace and burned them."
5,best chaucer scholarship out there,"I'm stunned there aren't more reviews on this book! To my mind, this is the single best piece of criticism on Chaucer out there; the essays are as fresh and relevant today as they were when the book was originally printed. In general I like the essays as stand-alones more than I like the overall argument (that Chaucer personally had anxieties toward women--who knows, who cares). As examples of attentive reading, the essays are outstanding. My students love Hansen's reading of the Miller's Tale; the essays on Griselda, the Knight, the Prioress all completely changed the way I thought the Canterbury Tales. I can't recommend this book enough."
3,Left Me Wanting More,"This book worked on certain levels and on certain levels it fell short. Many of the characters were not as well developed as I would have liked them to be, and the book seemed to end without letting the reader know the fate of certain characters. I would have liked for there to have been another chapter or at least an epilogue that let you know what happened to the characters."
3,Cute and fun,I think the raccoon is very cute. my daughter likes it. One downside of this toy is that the fur comes off quite readily when you pull on it.
5,"SO CUTE! Well made, fits both a child's hand or an adult's hand.","This puppet is well constructed. Space allows for a child's hand or an adult's hand. Puppet can twist and move easily in and out of the garbage can. Incredibly cute. We tease our dog with it. Not sure if it's an intelligence factor on the dog's part or if the puppet is really well made, but our dog thinks the raccoon is real. My kids love this puppet."
5,Very Fun Little Puppet,"Our 10 month old twins LOVE this puppet. The best part about this when compared to other puppets is the fact that the raccoon is inside the trash can...my kids love to ""tap on the lid"" of the trash can and I make it pop out and talk to them, etc.They laugh every time and they really love the interaction. We have a couple other puppets that we/they play with but this one is the most fun right now. I really recommend this toy puppet as a great toy for interacting with your infant."
5,Super Cute,Picked this up for a friend who loves Raccoons. Made a great gag gift and she loved it. Would definitely buy again.
1,Way overpriced little paperback,"I have no idea why this book is retailing at just under $35. It's a short little paperback, and I feel completely ripped-off. It'd be a questionable buy at 7.95... I expected quite a bit more."
2,Ergonomic but low light output,"I am pretty disappointed with amount of light coming from this unit.Xeon bulb is a joke. Two built in LED lights are brighter and use 10 times less energy. Get a flash light with LEDs only - 9 of them, 21 of them and you will be able to see in the dark. :-)"
2,Very weak light for the money.,Very weak light. I expected more from Coleman. I should have checked the customer review. It is very accurate.
4,Excellent!,"While the author does tend to ramble a bit, I think this is a really excellent book. My new puppy is really responding well using the techniques described here."
1,Not all other training methods are wrong,"I read this book and really wanted to get some good positive insight. I found the author very judgemental and accusing that any other method of training was abusive. I'm not sure what obedience classes she went to but not all classes are full of choke chains, beatings and abuse.This book is about how to make your life, the people in your life and everything about your life revolve around your dog.When this author recommended either wearing gloves or metal splints on your fingers for dogs going after your hands so hard they draw blood when you treat them... I thought that was just way too far. I would never beat my dog, but giving him a light tap so he isn't ripping my fingers to shreds and drawing blood is by no means abusive...There was good info about shaping and positive rewards but many other trainers teach these same concepts. I think this book went way too far in the keeping everything positive 100% of the time."
4,just ok,I was looking for a book to rehab abused dogs and this was the best I could find..no instructions for re-habbing.
4,"Clicker optional, still a good guide","I was disappointed that this book focuses on clicker training, as I just don't find that practicle for me. However, when I used Pat Miller's methods with praise in place of the clicker, I got wonderful results.I trained dogs with a correction method years ago. With my first new puppy in a decade, I decided to check out the ""positive training"" books, just to see what they were about. I am such a convert!The other book I really love is ""Treats, Play, Love"" by Burnham. Just excellent. She also examines different methods, including the history behind them and when correction methods may be appropriate. Pat Miller seems a bit more opposed to correction on a moral basis, so I appreciate Burnham's approach to the topic. One of Pat Miller's strong points is practical suggestions and an almost stet-by-step approach to basic training."
4,Great Dog Training Techniques,"We have a Jack Russell Terrier - Stan. This book introduced me to a completely ""new"" way of thinking around how to best train Stan. The positive approach has been SO MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE! I highly recommend this book to anyone with a dog, even if there are no significant behavior problems."
5,Best Book on Positive Training yet,"This is a COMPLETE book on the subject of Positive Training of Dogs, written for the laymen. A must reference/guide for anyone. After reading it (Several times) I keep it on the shelf for ready reference.How about a Video as a follow up Pat?"
4,great training book!,I am a 4-H obedience advisor and I thought this book was great. I will definitely be sharing the information that I learned with my kids.
3,The limits of positive dog training,"I got this book because we had recently gotten an 8 week old puppy, who was quickly becoming a handful. Nice detailed instruction with photos on how to treat-lure your dog into different tricks. The idea of managing your puppy through various means in order to avoid having to tell them no all the time was also very helpful. I notice that I say ""no"" to my puppy a lot less often than I did to the ones I helped raise when I was in high school back in the 80s. However, I wasn't so keen on the dogmatic preaching that corrections (even verbal reprimands) are never okay, and that ever resorting to them is a form of failure... or the implied message that if you love your dog, you'll welcome them on your couch and bed. I guess it's not unusual for professional trainers to insist that theirs is the only way, but the ideological rigidity wasn't particularly helpful to me in dealing with some of my pup's more challenging behaviors."
5,Terrific book for beginning to intermediate trainers!,"I recommend this book to all of my beginning and intermediate dog training clients. Intelligent, funny, and easy to read, it walks the student through basic dog training exercises step-by-step-by-step. Good pictures, too!"
5,Accessible Excellence,"This was the second positive reinforcement training book that I've read. I wish it were the first! It's informative and comprehensive without being overwhelming. The short chapters made reading a breeze! I've given this book a few times as gifts and have recommended it even more. It's my ""go to"" training book recommendation. Check out the author's training seminars at Peaceable Paws [...]"
3,Serious manufacturing defects,"This instrument looks beautiful, has excellent sound and desirable features such as built-in acoustic pickup, tuning indicator and the fine-tuning system. However, it arrived unplayable due to manufacturing defects which would have been caught by the most cursory quality control inspections. A screw was twisted off, allowing the chord bars to drop onto the strings. Two chord bars were severely warped, which made excessive pressure necessary in order to damp the unwanted notes in the chords. This was not shipping damage, as the unit was very well packed. Thanks to the diligence of the retailer, OS sent replacement parts which I installed. If you buy an Oscar Schmidt instrument, I recommend that you check it out thoroughly before leaving the store."
3,"Questionable quality of parts, mostly fixable - expect to spend more $","I do like my instrument. Serious autoharp players will want to remove the big hunk of junk plastic that Oscar Schmidt has decided is adequate for the chord bars and get something beautiful. There is a sticker on the bottom that looks like piano keys to denote which strings are which note. I can't for the life of me figure out how to remove it without damaging the finish, but wish I could! Chemical smell emanating from the sound hole even after 6 years. Eeew."
2,It is not what I ordered.,"It is a nice autoharp, but I ordered a 21 chord autoharp and I got a 15 chord autoharp. Now I have to live with the wrong autoharp or go through the hassle of repackaging it and sending it back."
3,Too slow @ 45 rpm,"I've got the CD which is great. Unfortunately for me this record is 2 x 45rpm discs, which is not marked here or on the product anywhere . My turntable only goes at 33 rpm! (The supplier gave a refund, without hesitation though). If it ever becomes available @ 33rpmI'll buy it."
2,"Nice voice, still needs work","While Michael Ball has a pleasent voice to listen to, the range of songs that he covers suffers often. On many occasions, he closes off vowels, and fakes vibrato, and often uses vocal tricks to get by. As Ball tries to cover pop songs, attempting to be stylistic, they come off as trying really hard, and not letting his voice flow nearly as well as he does in broadway tunes i have heard him sing. Basically, Michael Balll has a voice that can do certain things, but still relies on tricks to get him through lots of the album."
5,I just had to let you know!,"After seeing Michael Ball on a PBS channel where I live, I am now a big fan of his! I had never heard of him before that. Yes, it is hard to believe, isn't it. I have listened to this CD, and it is wonderful. It brings back to mind his great performance at the Royal Albert Hall, and the terrific voice I had heard. All of the songs on this CD are so good, and I especially like to hear him sing Gethseme, from the musical, Godspell. I listen to it over and over again. Wow, what a voice Michael has! He can do it all. Act, sing any type of song so very well, and make us smile too! He is truly talented. Since first listening to this CD, I have purchased others by him. I have become a true fan, and am hopeing Michael Ball delights us with a US tour very soon. I know you will enjoy this CD, and it will leave you wanting more! Thumbs up Michael!"
4,Great Voice,I first heard Michael in his role as Marius in Les Miserables. I was totally fascinated with the range of his voice. I later saw his Royal Albert Hall concert on a local public service television station and knew that I had to have his cd's. He can go from show tunes to pop and give an old favorite a new twist with his remarkable voice.
5,Michael Ball came to America,"Michael Ball came to Salt Lake City for his first concert in America. The performer has everyone standing in their seats and having one big party. His powerful voice exceeded his expectation. Thank You Michael ""You Did it"" your selections of songs couldn't have been better.We want you back!!! He sang broadway tunes, rock tunes, gospel tunes. I had a Josh Grogan fan sit next to me and she became a fan of MB in an instant. Salt Lake City, gave Michael Ball a key to the city and claimed 5/14/05 as Michael Ball day.But it is his voice,his professionalism and his dedication to give his all.GiselaOmaha, NE"
5,The new Frank Sinatra and Barry Manilow all in one,Michael Ball is one of the finest singers I've heard today. His voice is ever so rich. He knows how to command an audience. I could listen to his album from Royal Albert Hall for hours on end. I hope to add all of his albums to my collection very shortly. I surely hope that he will be performing his concerts in the United States very soon.
4,Byrdman Clark!,"Except for the few Beatle influenced tracks this is a good compilation of Gene's contribution to the early Byrds!More than just a pretty face,a songwriter that had he lived longer would have given even Dylan notice!Kurt."
1,"Housing Cracked, Now Leaks","I was hopeful this nozzle would be the answer to those cheap ones you get at Home Depot and the like. My first complaint was that the design of the handle was pretty abrasive to the skin between your thumb and finger as you grasp and hold it - especially when you do not want it to lock in the ""on"" position.Then after a month or so, it started leaking down at the base by the quick connect. Upon inspection, there were cracks in both the quick connect itself, and the housing of nozzle itself. Now to find how to get a replacement under warranty..."
2,Trigger gets stuck,I have had to return 2 of these because the trigger gets stuck ON after only having it for a week or two and using it daily. I think it is a sturdy product but has faulty inner parts....dont buy it if you are looking for a product that you can control the on and off.
2,"Expensive hassle, no jet spray.","This is the first item I have ever returned to Amazon. It simply does provide what you want in a garden hose nozzle.It is very well made, has a comfortable grip and a swivel base.It just does not have any useful spray patterns. No matter where you set the rear flow adjustment or where you turn the front nozzle it only puts out a chaotic mess. No jet stream was attainable.It required way too many turns of the front nozzle to change anything.Not recommended."
1,Waste of money,I purchased this hoping that I found a nozzle that will finally work...WRONG!! Within 2 weeks the black button that turns it on or off broke so it is always on. What a disappointment. Does anyone make a hose nozzle that works?
2,Cracked housing,"I have purchased several of this model of claber garden hose nozzles over the years and have used them daily and enjoyed them when they work. However, after 1-2 years and out of warranty, the spray nozzle housing starts to crack and leak and then breaks off entirely. I have a collection of several in my garage which I use as spare parts with the housing broken off at the same location-at the outlet just behind the adjustable spray head. You would think that Claber would correct this problem, but maybe they just want to sell another defective spray head?!Claber 9567 Metal-Jet Garden Hose Nozzle"
1,Fell apart after 3rd use! Stay away from this company!,"Hi,I am very disappointed in this product. It looks great and cost the most. But it simply fell apart after gentle use. Stay away from anything made by and sold by this company!"
3,Detailing,"I like the high distribution of water from the Claber jet Pistol Hose Nozzle. Sadly, it leaks at the fitting that connects to the nozzle."
1,Very Disappointing,Overpriced and poorly designed. I was looking for a reliable metal nozzle...this one is not it. The plastic parts immediately began to leak and the trigger was frustrating to use and stopped functioning.
3,Garden Hose Nozzle,"Claber Metal-Jet Pistol Garden Hose Nozzle #9567Sturdy quality; however, have difficulty adjusting the spray."
5,Great product,This is a wonderful product. The spray is powerful & v easy to adjust. Fun to use also!
3,In Want of Fuller Development,"For what it is, soundtrack music to a pastiche of short scenes, the compositions do meet the bill: Berlin in the 20s with melodies and chamber arrangements of what we are conditioned to expect by, say, Kurt Weill. The segments of Industrial March and Nightlife are particularly evocative. I saw the Nightlife clip of the film on TV, which enticed me to purchase the CD. But it all left a sense of prelude. Perhaps the best way to enjoy this music is when incorporated with the film, on DVD. The Largo from the film The Last Laugh is pleasant, especially with the featured cello, but then I am a sucker for cello."
1,NO GOOD!,"We bought several copies of these books directly from their web site. With the grammatical errors and the iffy subject matter, there is nothong here for serious students. A waste of money."
4,Concepts and examples anchor excellent reference,"In spite of the editorial errors in the book (blame IBM Press) and the rather pointless pedantic goings-on in these reviews about the use of the word ""quality"", this is a most worthwhile manual. Hargis presents her strategy of ensuring that technical documents reflect accuracy, clarity, completeness, concreteness, organization, retrievability, style, task orientation and visual effectiveness. She devotes a chapter to each concept and offers relevant examples to show aspiring tech writers how to apply the concepts to their own work. This is not just a grammar book; it is a well thought out set of tactics that help generate a worthwhile technical document. I'd like to see future editions of this expand into the area of data gathering and instructional system design. Nevertheless, the concepts Hargis describes here are worthwhile, as is this book."
4,Very useful,"While I haven't finished reading this yet, I've already found it very informative and useful. I especially like that it provides before and after examples to show how so-so writing can be improved. It should be required reading for any and all engineers or SME tasked with producing their own technical documentation!"
3,Suspicious,"This book came across my desk as a potential addition to our tech. comm. dept. library, and I admit that I haven't looked at it closely, but I'm not likely to either.Why would I read a book that contains one of the most egregious errors in modern usage in its title?""Quality"" without a modifier means nothing. ""Excellent quality""? ""Poor quality""? What quality?Tech. Comm. fascist as I tend to be, I have to say that anyone with such insensitivity to the logic of usage has no business writing a book about technical communications."
4,very insightful,"As a white woman from a small town who's madly in love with a black man from a big city, this book really helped articulate some of the communication differences that have plauged us. I strongly believe that perception is a person's reality; however, those perceptions can be changed if one becomes aware of the origin of those perceptions. The only negative to this book is that it comes off as ""textbook"" at times. I especially recommend this book to caucasions who have never been immersed in black culture."
5,Great inspiration for fitness,"I have bought and read this book and thought it offered a practical approach to dieting and fitness. Got me motivated to start exercising more and watching what I eat. As long as I know I can still have cookies and such but in moderation, then I can work easier towards obtaining a fitness lifestyle that will work for me. Loved the cover!"
2,Grammar School Library Material,"The content notes and editorial notes supplied for this book painted a rather different picture for me than what the book turned out to be.The extra-large print with three paragraphs per page almost had me looking for the library card affixed to the front. Its incredibly adolescent.The material content and complexity is sophomoric at best, and truly truly truly for the very novice person that sits in the parking lot staring at the gym - fixated in fear from actually crossing the parking lot and going in. However, the book does motivate those wonderful souls to at least make it through the parking lot to the grocery store ... FOR MORE COOKIES, because the author says its OKAY!!I'm returning this book immediately. Content is the equivalent collection of bad ""5-O'clock News"" Health Beat segments. Turn on your television - its FREE! This author should be embarrassed, BUT, I will give this two stars, because even ONE person motived to move deserves credit."
4,"It's a seller's market, I wish I knew this was going to be discontinued","I love this stuff! I use it in the morning under my eyes to de-puff and dry the area before putting on make-up. I've used the product for years and stocked up when I deployed.Now I need more and well, it's not in stores or a product on the St. Ives web site. So I can pay $14.99 each n/i shipping and handling in a six pack for what cost $4.00 in the store. Or I can buy the next closest thing to it for $49.99 in a 1.7 oz bottle.Again, it's a seller's market. We have little choice but to ante up or pay more for something else."
5,Mega mounting plate mystery solved,Length:: 1:23 MinsThis video shows you where to buy and how to install the mega mounting plate described in the owner's manual for these Yamaha speakers.
4,Good for the money,"These replaced two TIC outdoor speakers that only lasted 3 years. The TIC's had cleaner sounding tweeters and a little tighter bass (before the woofer cones jumped and stayed out of alignment), but these were cheaper, carry a better warranty, and I'm hoping they have Yamaha's well-known rock-solid reliability. I have never been a big fan of Yamaha speakers (except the HS-80M Studio monitors-amazing), but I can say from experience, they don't die. I have personally seen a pair of Yamaha speakers that fell 20 feet, laid in the snow for 2 months, and still work fine. I have used Yamaha consoles from the late 70's and early 80's, as well as current models. They still work exactly like they were intended; the knobs don't even crackle. Just about anything Yamaha puts their name on is well-built. Engines, pianos, keyboards, speakers, mixers, all of it."
4,outdoor speakers.,"Great product, when I first listened to them, I was used to listening to the speakers inside, which have a subwoofer, so at the time the outdoor speakers didn't seem to have much bass. Now that I have gotten use to listening to them they sound just fine. I wish they offered an outdoor subwoofer with this set. I would recommend these, very pleased."
4,Great product!,"I did research on Bose, Klipsch, and JBL outdoor speakers. I stumbled across these Yamaha speakers for a fraction of the cost of the 300-400 price tag I was looking at with other brands. I bought them thinking the risk was low. I can say I am exceedingly happy with this purchase! They have a very full sound and I don't feel like I compromised on quality."
4,Solid outdoor speakers,"We hooked these speakers up a few weeks ago and they sound better than anticipated. As expected, the bass is lacking, but they fill up the space outside our house quite nicely. The mounting bracket enables the speakers to be easily be angled if they are within reach so you can control the sound projection. The speakers were a bit bulkier than anticipated, but this was not a drawback for us. The speakers seem to need more power than a regular set of speakers, so make sure your amp is capable."
4,Work great,"I bought these for my husband so he could listen to his stereo outside by our backyard pond without blowing away the neighbors. The speakers are able to direct the sound to where he is.Have not had any issues with the grate falling off as others have mentioned and have had them outside for about a year. Of course, these are mounted under a deck so are not in direct sunlight."
4,Awesome,"We've had these for almost 2 years now and the only trouble we had was a small wiring problem, my fault. The only issue is that the metal covers fall out sometimes. I suppose I could glue them in to make sure they stay in. Other than that, we are very happy customers."
5,Great speakers!,"My husband chose these to replace our old surround sound speakers, two of which were blown. We bought four of them and they really sound great. They are a little bigger than we thought, but still fit on the existing brackets. All the other reviews are right, these are great speakers!"
4,Sound nice but the grills keep falling off!,I bought three pairs of these speakers to put around my pool. They sound great and fill the whole pool area with nice sound. I have had them for two months and almost from the beginning the grills keep falling off. They are exposed to the sun outside and the glue seems to keep melting with the heat and humidity of the weather in St. Louis. I have contacted Yamaha to see if there is a way to keep the grills from falling off. I am concerned about their durability for outdoor use and do not like to see the grills sitting on the ground every other week. I have another pair of infinity speakers and the Yamaha were cheaper and sound as good or better but the infinity seem more durable. If nothing can be done to keep the grills on these speakers I'm not sure I would buy them again. I'll see if Yamaha has a way to fix them.
3,Yammy Mammy,These speakers are adequate. But for the large size of housing you might expect a bit more oomph in the sound. They look good and sound OK but I was actually expecting a bit more. Not all bad for the price though.
4,not bad at all but not superb,"given the price, this product exceeds my expectations... i mean we had outdoors speakers that were $300 a pair and i couldn't feel any difference plus this one looks much better... having said this, if you're gonna party in your backyard, this are not the right speakers for you, although the sound is crystal clear and loud enough for regular usage, it's not a party speaker..."
5,Very good Speakers,Needed outside speakers for outside patio area. Mounted these under the deck so that they are protected somewhat. They have great sound and plenty of power. Clear sound and excellent range. Well worth the price. Same speakers at Best Buy were at least $50 more.
3,Good sound but the cover keep falling off,"I like the sound coming from the speakers but not the cover. I placed the speakers outdoor under the eve so rain wouldn't get to it. After about 1 year, the cover keep falling off. This happens to both speakers so i believe it's a design issue."
5,Speakers,"Oh wow!What a great deal!Great speakersJust opened boxes...Firstable, they are so big but at tye sane tine ut looks amazing richy..And wow! The sound!I have 300watt reciever.. It gives away a great powerful soundAnd those speakers are taking it really well!So happyTommorw my friend is coming to help me to put them up in my pool areaI am ordering 2 more pairsSatisfated!!!!"
4,very satisfied,"I just purchased and installed these on my patio. I attached the brackets to the brick (mortar) using tapcon screws. The installation was no problem. I particularly liked the included ""screws"" that hold the speakers to the mounting brackets - they are tool-free and very easy to work with.I do wish that the speakers could be adjusted both horizontally and vertically but this is not possible. If you mount the speakers in a horizontal orientation then you can move the speakers left or right. If you mount the speakers in a vertical orientation then you can move the speakers up or down.The sound is fine, but the bass is just not really present. These *are* outdoor speakers, though, so I did not expect booming bass. The speakers achieve what I wanted -- they give me plenty of decent sound on my patio. I am really happy with my purchase. I don't think I could have gotten a better value than these Yamahas for <$90."
4,Great Set of Outdoor Speakers,These speakers have a great sound and were easy to install. Adjustable on the vertical or horizontal however I don't see a time when you'd really want to adjust the horizontal but only the vertical. Very happy with this pair of speakes especially at the price I was able to purchase them for.
4,Great Outdoor Speakers,"I love these speakers, they play nice and clear no matter how high I turn the volume, can't go wrong."
2,REALLY?,With in two days of install the grills popped out and now wont stay in.VERY DISAPPOINTED with over all quality
5,Neck and neck w/ Bose 251s,"I just hooked them up and ran an A/B test with a set of Bose 251s. I think the sound reproduction is every bit as good as the Bose setup. For a third of the price you can't pass these by. The only thing that remains to be determined is how well they will stand up to the weather. If you can mount them under an overhang and keep them out of rain and snow, I think these are the real deal."
4,Great Sound at a Great Price!,"I've had these speakers outside for use on my deck for about 9 months now. I am completely pleased with my purchase. The sound quality is great, especially for the $85 I paid. Just be aware of the size when ordering. These are not the tiny little satellite speakers that you sometimes see used for outdoor speakers underneath the eaves of a house. They are full size speakers which contributes to the very respectable amount of bass response that they are capable of. I have very wide eaves on my house so this was not an issue. 4 stars because there are better sounding speakers out there if you are willing to pay a lot more for them. On the ""Bang for Your Buck"" scale these definitely rate 5 stars."
4,Yamaha NS-AW350W 2-Way Indoor/Outdoor Speakers,"I first looked at Best Buy for some decent outdoor speakers. I was not wanting to spend hundreds of dollars on mid-range brands, Bose, Polk, etc - some of which they had there. Sure they ""feel"" sturdy, heavy and quality built but they're expensive for something which will take outdoor abuse. On the flip side, I didn't feel comfortable with the cheapy Insignias they had there either. I didn't need thundering bass or extensively loud music. My yard is only about 34'x40'. Sure, you can get better quality sound out of some of the units mentioned above. However, for the price, the sound quality of these speakers are a sensational value. Clarity is very good, bass is adequate for their intended purpose and mounting was easy. For the money, you can't go wrong. These are a bit larger than some of the competition but they're not very heavy."
4,Great sound!,"I have been using these speakers out by the pool for about two months now, and have no regrets. They sound even better and Fuller than I had expected. I have them mounted under the Eve of my roof. The only reason I am giving them 4 instead of 5 is that the front grill started coming off on one of them a few days ago. I was able to snap it back in place, and it seems to be holding still. But I'm worried it may come loose again. Maybe the kids hit it with a ball or something. I definitely think they were worth what I paid."
5,Great product,"I used these speakers for a large screened porch, covering about 500 square feet of space. They are hooked up to a sansui 771 amp, and they sound great. Bass could be better but it's as good as you would expect from speakers this size. Install is simple and the hardware is heavy duty. Overall very satisified...Yamaha makes some great speakers."
2,Out of date. And you must reconfigure your computer to get the software to run.,"The WSAD included is out of date and when I installed the application it would not run. But don't take my word for it. Search the internet for, ""The license could not be found. websphere studio application developer 5.0 can not start"". (The current version is 5.1.1.)The IBM web site says to change the date on your PC to May 1, 2005 then install. It does install and will run, but when you reset the date on your PC the license has expired!Instructions to configure a working database are inaccurate and do not work when followed verbatim. Some of the illustrations and step-by-step instructions no not match the actual screens displayed. The design information is good, but if you are looking for a book to learn how to start using WSAD, this is not the answer."
2,Dont buy this book,"The title is ""Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere"" but the book does not teach you how to programm with IBM WebSphere. The book covers very high level and briefly leaving you in the dark."
2,Get your Ph.D. in CompSci first!,"The book is thorough, comprehensive but full of buzzwords and gibberish that you'll have a difficult time understanding unless you already know Java and WebSphere. This book is definitely NOT for the beginner wanting to learn Java/WebSphere."
5,Innovative and Tuneful Debut,"This CD is a terrific balance of progressive and melodic tunes that Mr. Schultz has composed. His songs do not wreak of the usual commercializing yearnings that other supposed jazz artists yearn for the apellation of ""spokesman-for-their-generation."" The individuality and quality of composition speak for themselves. I am waiting for Mr. Schultz's next installment. Bravo."
5,Wonderful for babies,"I bought this for my son's first birthday. He loved it from the start, but I especially loved it because it kept him busy on our seven hour long plane ride to Scotland this summer. It was deffinitely a life saver. He loves to put his hand inside the big puppets like mommy and copy the sound I make. It's really cute and very well made. We've had it for six months now and he still pulls it out to play with maybe once a week."
4,A great toy for long rides,we used this on a extended car trip. Each time we took it out the puppets would be involved in a new story. great fun. good durability and bright colours.
1,Very bed quality,"I am disappointed by ""My first finger puppet book"". The quality of this book could be much better."
4,The Principal's New Clothes,"What would you do if your principal was going to be tricked, but you didn't say anything? This happens many times in The Principal's New Clothes by: Stephanie Calmenson. The Story is about a principal who is a sharp dresser, but to fake designers come along and trick him into something embarrassing.It is a great book for a young because it will make them laugh. The story takes place in a present time at a regular school. The story is silly, yet it has a valuable meaning; you should never lie it may hurt someone.The author writes in a style that kids can connect t. It is a good topic for kids. What kids wouldn't want to see the principal in their underwear?"
2,IF ONLY THEY WEREN'T SMASHED...,"My husband loves these and will even run to the store at night to buy a couple of packages. Ordering in large volume would have been economical but he asked me to stop getting them through the mail. As much as he likes the patties and never gets tired of them, they arrive broken to the degree where they are not worth even the discounted price."
5,Perfect in every way,"These arrived perfectly...no breakage at all. Came fast and the packages were all fresh. These are so hard to find, was glad to be able to subscribe via amazon."
1,Purple needs a 2 or 3 disc set!,"These songs were on an LP once. Now that we have CD's that run 80 minutes, there's no reason for this. Deep Purple need a 2 or 3 disc set. They have too many classics for this kind of poor treatment."
5,International Addresses? This works!,"This address book is lovely, with country home drawings, and good quotes to brighten your day, and nice little details everywhere. I like its size, not too small, not too big--it fits nicely in my desk drawer and hand. Best of all, the space for addresses isn't labled for telephone, email, etc. Which means I can fill it in the way that is convenient for me. That is important, since many addresses take up more than the traditional three lines alloted by most address books. There are five lines per entry, spaced like a college ruler notebook. There is an extra lined page at the beginning of each letter of the alphabet, for personal notes. There are plenty of refill pages, and space for notes at the end. The only drawback for me, is that there is no pocket to insert loose notes or cards. All in all, a very good buy."
3,ghost house underground 8 film collection,"the shipping charges i felt were a little high but it was offset by the price. also i felt for the shipping fee it shouldn't take a week to arrive. upon viewing the films, they were not as good a story behind them as i had expected in comparison to the 8 movies to die for. i don't know if ill ever buy another film in that series."
1,Lamest movies ever!,"This product is a waste of money. The movies suck. They have no plot, bad actors, and lame special effects. Don't waste your money like I did. The other Ghosthouse movies are much better. I am very disappointed that these were picked to be called horror movies to die for."
2,Did not like content or pictures,"I was disappointed that this ""alphabet"" book would choose the word ""extinct"" for the letter ""X"". My 2 1/2 year old does not care for this book. The art work is not appealing."
5,Good product,"I purchased my first one at a paint supply place. I try to avoid driving a lot since fuel went through the roof. It's easy to clean and fulfills my needs. Otherwise I wouldn't have bought a spare, especially at this price."
1,I didn't buy used!,"I don't know how the gun itself works because the one I received was in a box which had been sliced apart and taped back together (and I don't mean on the seams). The plastic which holds the actual spray gun also had spots and grease on the inside and had clearly been used. After talking to Amazon support I was told that I could take the item to the post office to return it. Net result my time and gas wasted returning an obviously used item which was sent to me. I have been a long time Amazon supporter, but this experience guarantees that I will not be buying anything from ""Tool King"" and will be very hesitant to buy tools from Amazon again."
4,reel deal casino shuffle master,being retired and having lots of time on my hands i like to play slot machines. the card games however are another matter as i do not see any instructions or rules on how to play the various games so i do not have an understandingof those. i am limited an where i can go so i enjoy these type of games.
3,Good As A Companion Volume,"If you truly are looking to play Rock'N'Roll piano DON'T GET THIS BOOK...first.First, devour Mark Harrison's Blues Piano, from the same Hal Leonard series. Rock'N'Roll piano obviously has its origins in the Blues, and Harrison's book is COMPREHENSIVE. It has a plethora of examples of left hand patterns, comping styles, and right hand techniques--all pertaining to the various styles within the blues genre, and even Rock'N'Roll.Next, get Vinter's Rock'N'Roll Piano. It's helpful, but primarily as a companion volume."
4,One of the best living American writers,Lethem's novels are superior to his essays and short stories. His essays are superior to his short stories. He has a wonderful way of articulating a particular view in american culture that is sadly lacking in competant literary and critical figures. Most of his published work is far better than the majority of stuff out there. Worthy of the price - at least checking out of the library. Remember those?
1,Smug and clueless,"Employing evasion and omission in an attempt to deceive the privileged chattering classes rarely makes for riveting film-making, and Swiss director Nicolas Rossier's Aristide and the Endless Revolution is no exception. Apparently ignorant of large swaths of Haiti's history, Rossier is reduced to manipulating archival news footage and mis-translating interviews to attempt to prove his poorly thought-out thesis. Rossier, a Haiti novice who spent little time in the country while making his film, is apparently unaware or uninterested in letting facts complicate what he no doubt finds such a compelling narrative. Better, perhaps, for viewers to have a look at Asger Leth'sGhosts of Cite Soleilto have a more realistic depiction of life in Haiti during recent years, or to search out a real documentary talent like Alex Gibney'sTaxi To the Dark Sidefor the kind of compelling political filmmaking that is so obviously beyond Nicolas Rossier's rather amateurish grasp."
5,Great resource,"This book is a terrific resource for those who want to learn more about Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues. Well told, comprehensive biography of an eccentric, controversial singer. Filled with anecdotes and well-researched, I recommend this book highly."
5,Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook 2000-2001,"I have been buying Blue Ribbon since it was first published. I have every issue and refer to them quite often. Blue Ribbon is by far the ""best"" college basketball reference guide available. I am a Kentuckian, by birth, an avid UK and college basketball fan!! This ""reference"" book is a ""must have"" item for all college basketball fanatics!!!! Go ""Blue Ribbon"" and go ""Cats""!!"
1,Waste,"I have gotten this book every year for a while now, but this years edition was terrible because it did NOT have the recruiting profiles of the Top 44 as they have and years past and that they CLAIM they do now."
4,a long time between reviews,"its been a while since this album was reviewed. i came across it while looking for the track 'hot rod lincoln' and discovering that les claypool did a cover. this is a cool album! there's only one or two songs i don't particularly like. i'm from australia so the whole nascar scene is a little alien to me but who doesn't like fast cars and heavy metal! coupled with the fact that i've only just recently seen 'talladega nights' it adds up to a fun experience! highlights for me are type o negatives 'highway star' and les claypools 'hot rod lincoln', naturally."
3,just okay,I had this CD a few years ago but lost it. I remember it being better and couldn't wait to get this replacement. Time does funny things because this CD wasn't nearly as good as I remembered.
4,It's fun to listen to...,"This is the first compilation CD I've ever owned. I bought it for Fenix TX's cover of Get Out Of My Dreams (cause I'm a Fenix TX fanatic). I listened to the entire CD, after immediately skipping to track 7 when I first got it, and I have to say this is a fun CD to listen to (especially in the car, but not in traffic... boo). I would highly recommend this CD if you like to get pumped and have a fun drive to wherever you're going! I just wish it wasn't censored... (kinda destroys the Slipknot track.)I need to get some more compilation CDs, they have some rare tracks on 'em"
4,decent experience overall,"customer service was helpful in changing my shipping options.the product itself was decent. it does not fit my laptop, it says, 'fits most 15""' if you have a great number of books such as i do, a water bottle may not fit in the side pocket... it's a nice bag though, seems well-made."
2,Good for making exact copies of author's quilts but . . .,"This book is very frustrating to me. I love batiks, and the author's works are beautiful, but I am not a beginner and definitely not interested in copying her quilts in whatever size and color schemes she has used. Therefore, I find it extremely annoying that the directions tell you how many of what size shapes to cut for her quilt, but don't say what the finished block sizes are. Of course, I can figure that out, but why make me do all that math istead of including such basic information? Total book includes 10 pages of text on batiks, 22 pages of text on very basic, generic quiltmaking techniques, and 77 pages consist of 18 particular quilts with the instructions for copying them."
4,"need to know this is not the original, but it's fine","this is mostly a collection of photocopies, not a reproduction of the original.Fine for the purpose intended. Okay quality, not perfect."
5,old timer pocket knife,I replaced an Old Timer knife and was very pleased with the quality of the new knife. It met and exceeded my expectations.
3,perfect fit,"It appears to be custom made for my smoker, only concern if any is that it should be tighter around the bottom, this is my second one, I lost the 1st one during a rainstorm with high winds"
1,Disappointed with product.,I purchased this cooker cover and within two weeks it is already torn. Not sure why it is made out of such a flimsy material. I cannot believe the description says it is Heavy Duty Material. Do not recommend.
1,Do not buy if you intend to use outside,"I got this for my brinkman smoker hoping I could leave it outside after each use. This worked for a few weeks and seemed fine. But I tore it like paper on a cold day when I went to remove it. Yes, I admit I bought this on PRICE (9.99 is very cheap) but I expected better even though I realize this was the cheapest price. I believe you unfortunately 'get what you pay for' with this product. Do not buy."
2,You get what you pay for,"Got this at local home improvement warehouse for $7. Worked great for 2 months, then tear appeared near the base, just above the elastic. We then babied it. It lasted 5 more months. A wind storm this last week lead to the top tearing apart. The product has become brittle. We do live in the desert, with intense sun, and cold evenings. But really, there is no excuse for multiple failures in such a short period. Why 2 stars? Worked well until it broke. The elastic was adequate to prevent wind from blowing it away."
1,Cover Failure,"The Heavy Duty Cover proved to be anything but. It literally began to fall apart after 2 months, apparently from exposure to sunlight. I replaced it with a large heavy duty garbage bag which is still intact and functioning after several months and a a cost of only a few cents."
3,not heavy duty but does the job,"The Char-Broil 4714 Heavy Duty Water Smoke cover works and does the job, but is not heavy duty material. It seems on the thin side, but covers the smoker and prevents the rain from getting in."
3,Char Broil Smoker Cover,"As far as I can tell, the cover is doing it's job. But it is too early to tell it's effectiveness regarding protecting the smoker. The spring/summer storms have not started yet. If the cover protects the grill through that weather, then upgrade my rating to a 5."
1,smoker cover,"I was very disapointed with the smoker cover. It is made of a very THIN plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material. This type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat, weather, and also some general scratching. Just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it. The company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable. Sincerely yours, Allen Vest III"
3,smoker cover,The cover fits over my smoker & keeps the weather out. That's what I wanted when I ordered it & that's what it does when it is on the smoker. Everything works fine.
1,The worst song,This song is just bad.Is it just me or does all of Nelly's songs sound exactly the same lyrically.Horridly written.Unoriginal.Do I need to go on?Don't waste your money.
4,half round foam roller,"Roller purchased after using a similar one in physical therapy. The medium density (blue) is definitely harder than the one in my PT's office, but it has worked for me."
1,Too soft,"I ordered a ""soft"" gray 1/2 foam roller. I had already purchased an OPTP Pro Foam Roller. Since the full round OPTP roller is VERY firm, I elected to use a softer 1/2 roller to do some standing balance work to begin with. This gray soft foam roller offers ABSOLUTELY NO resistance. It is like the foam used for packaging electronics. It was a complete waste of money."
1,Never heard from vendor,"I'm not sure what happened, but this is the first time I've not received a product nor been contacted by a vendor. I waited 10 days until after the product was ""scheduled"" to arrive before cancelling the order."
4,Very cute,"My son loves these because he can just slip them on so easily. They are really cute and can be worn with jeans, shorts, or dressed up for church or other nice events. I really like the low cut of these, but yet they have the look of boots. The brown part does scuff rather easily, or I would have gone 5 star on this one."
5,love them.,"i love these boots. my son is on his third pair now in three years only because his foot keeps growing. they still look brand new when my husband buffs them. i am saving the older pairs for my younger son because the shoe store said they were in perfect condition to pass on something of which is not typical of childrens shoes. no wear and tear here, and he wears them 3x week to school with his uniforms."
3,Great concept but pen's ink runs too quickly,I like having a pen and highlighter in the same barrel and there are not a lot of options out there. I bought a box of this and while they work well I was disappointed to experience that the pen's ink runs out very quickly (about 2-3 weeks for me of normal use). I thought maybe it was just on one of the pens but all of them have the same limited ink supply. I thought that the highlighter would run out or dry out first so it was disappointing that the ink runs out so quickly --- i have 20cents bic pens that have lasted for years....
2,Mediocre at best,"Yes it is nice to have a highlighter and pen in one writing utensil. Unfortunately, both the pen part and the highlighter part are disappointing. The ink from the pen does not release evenly and nor does it write smoothly. I would rate the highlighter half individually to be among the worst highlighters I have used. The yellow highlighter is dull and the size of the tip is awkward.All in all, I'd advise against purchasing this product."
4,Very cute.,This puppet is very cute and soft. Its big enough for adult hands too. When Dad puts this puppet on and adopts a mouse voice the kids love it and he has them rolling on the floor laughing in no time.
1,Another log for the fire,"Mr. Stanley may know allot about RPG programming, but this book treats the reader like a teacher on tenure. The examples and detailed labs are useless unless the reader is in a classroom with a very helpful professor. Statements like, ""After the instructor gives you directions on the use of the equipment"" doesn't help much if you are trying to learn at home. Not to mention the questions are quite tedious and blank coding forms are not included in the book. The printing is also of very poor quality making the pictured examples look like something that was left out in the rain. I will be looking elsewhere for instruction and using this book to even out the legs under my kitchen table."
4,Missing Record Option,"I have the LK-110 & really like this keyboard, it is a ton of fun. It has an easy interface to learn with. It has Steps 1-3 and a demo for each song (this helps with keeping rhythm.) There are 100 songs, 100 sounds, & 50 rhythms which is enough for any beginner. One really good quatlity are the midi ports for compatibility. So, for the price is definatly worth the value. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 was because there is not a way to attach the stand and it is a little more likely to fall."
4,Good sound,"This keyboard is just a decent noisemaker for kids. I bought it so I would have a portable musical reference for a college music theory course.Two complaints, one small, one huge:No big deal, but the ""tones"" you can select from sound pretty weak, although there are a bunch to choose from so it's not hard to find something that sounds okay.But it really irks me that you can't play more than four keys at the same time! If you have any experience with the piano you're going to find this shortcoming completely unacceptable.Two bits of praise:There is a digital display showing both the treble and bass clef staves. When you hit a key the display shows you where the pitch falls on the staves. Ingenious!Very lightweight and portable.Conclusion: Great for kids, but don't even think about it if you have been playing for any amount of time."
5,Great keyboard,"I just started learning the piano, so I purchased this because it was fairly priced and I can practice in my room in silence at night time without disturbing anyone.I would definitely, DEFINITELY Recommend this to other people."
2,Sound quality poor,"Just purchased (and returned) this keyboard. I thought for the price this would be a great keyboard for my six year old daughter to practice her piano lessons. When we played in the various piano modes it sounded very off. Electric or toy sounding is the best way for me to describe it. I took it to my daughters piano teacher to see what she thought- she said it was ok for maybe 6-9 months but the sound was just to off to be a long or even medium term keyboard. Compared the sound of this to my neighbors Yamaha YPT-320 and there was NO comparison sound wise. Returned this and bought the Yamaha. If you just want a toy to kind of play around with this is pretty cool, and the kids love it, if sound doesn't matter go for it but for something a little more serious I don't recommend."
5,bought for my girlfriend,"Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she seems to like it. If nothing else, her parents think I'm pretty great for it."
1,Poor Quality! Broke very quickly!,"I bought this keyboard package for my son as a birthday gift so he could take lessons. However, after barely 6 months of use, the keyboard has begun to turn off in the middle of play. It is completely useless now and I am going to have to purchase another one.When I went to Casio's website to look into the warranty, one of the selections for reason of return said ""Shuts off during play."" So I guess this is not a rare issue. I filed a claim, being less then 1-year from date of purchase, but the kicker is, I have to PAY to have the keyboard shipped to Casio. Then there is no guarantee that I won't be charged $75 for repair.I am so unhappy about this and so is my son, who will have to miss lessons and practice until we can buy a better keyboard. And definitely NOT a Casio!UPDATE: We found out that the problem was NOT the keyboard, it was with the power cord. We now only use this keyboard with batteries. Still would not recommend."
3,O.K. for a beginner,"We thought that the Casio Keyboard was O K for a beginner but it does have the electronic sound to it which you may like but not being used to using a keyboard, I didn't really like the sound. The keys were weighted so they had to have a stronger touch than a piano to play them so I really didn't like that. The ""B"" note didn't light up and I thought I was supposed to get headphones with it that weren't included. So to play the keyboard you need a lot of batteries or a power cord that doesn't come with it. So with all that, it wasn't bad at all just not what I wanted."
1,worst Hellblazer read so far,"This is the worst Hellblazer I read so far.It is disappointing because I read two other volumes written by the same author ---Garth Ennis--- (Dangerous habits and Fear & loathing) and both were very good. Unfortunately Son of Man is written like a parody: as if the author tried to ridicule its own work. The attempts at humour are lame (e.g. a demon insults Constantine's by telling him that his dad is sucking c**** in hell. To which Constantine replies ""does he swallow?""....umm, really? I stopped this kind of jokes when I turned 16.)Despite these lame moments, the story itself is interesting. However the art is of poor quality. Especially if you compare with the runs illustrated by Leonardo Manco.I regret spending money on this graphic novel..."
5,4-wheel walker,Great walker. Very sturdy but light for putting it in a car. Great for shorter persons. Basket is nice for carrying stuff but easy to remove when not needed.
1,Just another collection of recipes,"I thought this book would give me some idea of how salt works while cooking. I often cook without recipes, so knowing how and when to add salt is an important part of having a dish realize its full potential.Instead, the only prose is a chatty and trivial history of salt. You could get better info than that on the internet. The rest of the book is comprised of straightforward recipes that just happen to include, you guessed it, salt! Like how many recipes don't.There is nothing special about this book. Better to go to a local bookstore and find a recipe book that interests you."
4,Read this!,Short and sweet:Read this if: 1) you're trying to clarify your arguments against (or even for) globalization -- Singer lays out all the issues you'll have to grapple with eventually. 2) you're looking for a straightforward overview of the key organizations that are controlling our world today and you're concerned about undemocratic processes. Skip it if: 1) you're so sure of what you think that you're convinced there are no new angles to consider. 2) you are already pretty familiar with the IMF and company and need something more in-depth.
2,Idealistic but Sufferable,"While clearly very passionate and thoughtful about global politics and ethics, I found Peter Singer to be idealistic and often times lacking in deep insight, rather choosing to focus in broad sweeps in ways that he cannot completely justify. A good read for some, perhaps, but overall not a worthwhile experience for me."
1,Globo-Lying,"While I will certainly finish the book, so far I have read only the Preface to the second edition.It is a fabric woven of gross distortions, lies, misleading simplifications, evasions, and evident falsehoods.Worse, Professor Singer is far too well-informed, and far too bright, for any of this to be unintended.It is a great misfortune that this book, like his others, will be read, discussed, and admired around the world.But, if the preface is a fair indication, it is a pack of shameful lies."
3,More about the politics of globalization,"This book has more of a political focus than an ethics focus. A serious shortcoming is the lack of appreciation for the Eastern perspective. There is no mention in the index of Buddha, Confucius, or Taoism. How can you consider globalization from a parochial perspective? I recommend this book by Canright:Achieve Lasting Happiness: Timeless Secrets to Transform Your Life. ""Achieve Lasting Happiness"" proposes Confucian philosophy as a basis for universal ethics. Globalization will crush humanity unless there is a system of universal ethics as a counter balance to greed on a world-wide scope."
4,excellent,"This book does a wonderful job of collecting the views of Peter Singer and showing how they apply to the Globalism debate.He is brilliant, and one of only a few philosophers who also write well!"
2,Outdated in a Dynamic World,"While considered cutting edge at the time of publishing Singer's book ""One World"" simply doesn't go the distance a book should go in the dynamic world of today. Singer, basically, stops where essential liberal interests do which is a really bad thing for an ethicist to do. He doesn't get into a really nitty-gritty stuff such as seeing the consequences of leisurely, short-term benefits oriented political action as ultimately damaging for the system. By not going the distance Singer is cutting the branch on which he is sitting. Do not read."
1,Poorly packaged - not as described,"I placed an order for a matching pair. One arrived with broken glass. Returned for replacement. Replacement arrived with broken glass. Returned again for replacement. Third one arrived okay, but the glass is a different style than the remaining one from the original pair. So I am returning both. Also, the product description states the fluorescent bulb is included. There were bulbs in the first two shipments. But the third one arrived without a bulb. Since the packaging design was also different, and there was no place for the bulb in the package, I do not believe this was a packaging error.Trans Globe Lighting PL-5040 BK Black Outdoor Wall Light"
3,GREAT IDEA CHEAP PRODUCT,THIS IS MY SECOND TIME PURCHASING THIS ITEM. THE FIRST TIME THE PLASTIC GLASS CRACKED DOWN THE MIDDLE AND THE BLENDER TOP LOST 1 OF ITS BLADES WHILE BLENDING A SHAKE. HOPEFULLY THE KINKS WERE WORKED OUT
1,Not as ordered,"Although the blender works, it looks as if it has been sitting in the sun or was not finsihed properly. The colour of the unit is supposed to be white but it is cover in yellow blotches. As result it will never sit on my kitchen counter and only be brought when needed.2/10db"
2,"Burning smell, too long to blend well","This was given to me by someone who bought it from a TV promo, and I'm very glad I didn't pay for it. It took way too long to blend up a little juice mixed with protein powder and frozen peaches, something my Magic Bullet does efficiently and without a motor-burning-out smell. I used it for the first time today, and while I liked the size and seal of the cup, and the fact that the cup locks onto the base, I am not at all confident that this will last...I was afraid it wouldn't last through the blending of the first shake! I'll update after I've used it every morning for a month or two."
1,Save your money!,"Please save your money by not purchasing this product. This blender does not work well; it does not fully blend frozen items, it has a motor burning smell while in use, and the lid is difficult to get off. Just an overall bad product."
4,Great blender,My brother loves this product. My wife bought this for him for Christmas. He uses it a lot and loves the fact that it is portable and he can take his smoothies with him when he is on the go.
3,professional,"Good blender for the price. Takes several minutes to blend up items, but it doesdo the job."
4,Just right!,"I drink protein powder shakes for breakfast each day, and this blender is perfect for that. I make 'em and take 'em with me in the car, so having the to-go cap for the carafe is very handy. I ordered an extra carafe, too."
1,Leaks and closes too tight,"There is a rubber seal on this blender on the inside which was shredded up by the blender within 2 or 3 uses. Now it either a) leaks badly or b) is impossible to get the top off. It has two kinds of leaking--dripping down the side (no big deal) or spraying out from the bottom (gigantic mess). Unfortunately, you wont know which its going to do until you turn it on.I would gladly go out and buy the $80 kind now rather than this piece of junk. Furthermore, the blender shakes like crazy even on the lowest setting. This blender cannot hold a candle to our glass blender, which broke after 10 years (when we dropped it on the floor--motor was still fine)."
1,Awful,This thing couldn't blend hot butter. Awful..good luck with ice. Nosier than a DC 10 jet engine.
4,Great!,"I love this little blender. The only problem is when I try to make my strawberry slushy with diet gingerale... If you try to put something fizzy in this blender it leaks all over the place because the air bubbles have nowhere to go. Same think if you try to put something hot in the blender. Otherwise, great, long-lasting blender."
5,Grover-Trophy Recorder Swab,We bought this at the same time we bought a recorder...this is a great product for teaching a child how to care for their recorder..It's easy to use...
5,Works well for a reasonable price,"My local music store wanted over $6 for a recorder swab. Crazy! This swab works great, was reasonably priced and arrived in VERY fast time."
4,Grover-Trophy Soprano Recorder Swab,"Works well. The only drawback is the wire ""handle""that bends too easily. A stiffer handle would work better.Thanks!"
4,A history book you will enjoy reading,"I liked this book. Lincoln doesn't just report the history, he tells the story. Some highlights: the death of the Czar and family, the battle of Krondstadt, and Trotsky's assassination. When I picked up this book, I knew almost nothing about the Russian Civil War. Who were the White Russians? How were American (and allied) troops involved? How did Lenin and Stalin come to power? Now that I've read the book, I think I've learned a lot.Some history texts are ""dry"", but this one was both informative and interesting."
4,Surprisingly good.,"Hmm. I was pleasantly surprised by this band--both its live show (opening for Muse) and their CD. At their best, their live show carries echoes of The Velvet Underground and Led Zeppelin, especially Johnny Borrell's onstage presence, which harks back to Robert Plant's frenetic clapping and body narration.Quite a good show, and several good tracks on the CD, especially ""Golden Touch"" and ""Rock and Roll Lies"".They were also the first Indie band that I have ever seen improvise during their stage show--and oftentimes the improv was as good or better than the song in which it was played."
4,Good and getting better,"A cocksure lead singer, not afraid to let you know how great he and his band are. Makes you cynical until you hear the tunes and boy do they deliver. Although they certainly took their cues from the Strokes arrival in Britain in 2001, the band has a wide eyed look at the chaos of the London scene that charms all on its own. Great songs aplenty, what the Libertines might sound like if Pete got straight and didnt go out of his way to derail his own songs. New UK single Somewhere Else is an anthemic rocker that promises greatness is at hand for Razorlight."
3,johnny borrell not all he's hyped up to be,"Britain's newest band with the ""Golden Touch"" and their charmingly arrogant frontman Johnny Borrell (self-proclaimed songwriting genius) have a few good songs, but the album as a whole is not quite that brilliant.""Golden Touch"" is a great pop tune with a nice beat and decent songwriting, and there are a few tracks that stand out (""Up All Night,"" ""Stumble and Fall""). Unfortunately, though, most of the other tracks either sound the same or are simply not distinct enough to be stimulating. After several listens, most of the songs on the album are neither poetic works nor exciting dance grooves, and seem to fall somewhere flat and bland, inbetween.They're cute and they can play, but between Johnny B's repetitive screaming choruses and the guitar riffs that sound like they were stolen from someone else's songs, Razorlight might not be the geniuses they claim to be."
3,Not very good songs.,"I like their sound, I like the guy's voice, but they do not have very good songs. After I hear it I don't even remember what it was about. That's not the problem in itself, I feel this way listening to The Strokes, but at least The Strokes have melodies and catchy choruses.Okay I'm kinda getting off the point, the only songs with anything appealing are IMO Rock and Roll Lies and Golden Touch. These guys could be a lot better if they wrote some better songs. :(I'm still giving them 3 stars because it's not bad music, it's just... they're missing something."
3,razorlights become razorburns after a few uses,"competently derivative.if finding the best rock and roll recordings is a $1,000,000 lottery, this record is like winning $1 on a $1 ticket purchase- it's a wash (although it would be cool to get at least some of my money back).the dynamics, structure/non-structure, etc. are there sonically. the posturing, requisite outlandish remarks (ala liam gallagher), etc. are there too... so why is it like drinking a glass of lukewarm water?track 10 sounds like ""gloria"" with several changes. the approach was timidly reminiscent of ""the doors"" cover version of ""gloria"". once this was in mind, i just wanted to hear that cover again instead of this track. ""the jam"" had a great song titled ""in the city"" though.the first rotation of ""golden touch"" is freshly reminicent of other songs- although it's stale by the third listen.has the shelflife of ice cream under a heatlamp.three stars because it can be played nicely in teen clothing stores."
3,Razor-Lite,"A near miss. Almost every song on ""Up All Night"" flies outta the gate with such a cool swagger you're ready to spray-paint the band's name on the nearest cop car, parked or not. But then, each time, the song's momentum goes oddly flat, petering out into dull repetition while singer Johnny Borrell artificially works himself into an actorly lather. The closest ""Up All Night"" comes to perfection is ""Vice"", which uses all the usual scrap parts nicked from the punk junkyard to build to a monster of a chorus but, frustratingly, fades into the same unmemorable repetition 'n' lather as everything else. There's no doubt Razorlight knows the road to a good tune, now they just need to figure out what to do with themselves once they get there."
2,Do not even bother,"Two stars is being generous. Completely derivative, unmemorable wannabe pop rock. ""Golden Touch"" is a decent song, hence my (unfortunate) purchase of this release many moons ago. If you are relatively new to music, I would recommend you not to buy this, but if you are curious and do buy it, be safe in the knowledge that there is far greater stuff out there waiting for you."
4,Hes no genius but,he can write quite the album. sure not every song is a gem. some like to the sea and in the city are downright horrible but songs like Vice up all night rip it up and dont go back to dalston more then make up for it
3,An alright band...,"Here's a band that doesn't deserve half the hype they're receiving from the british press. The case with most of the songs is that they start off really well, but once they get halfway through them, the band doesn't know what to do. There was maybe one or two songs that I actually sat through the entirety of. The band has two very clear musical sounds, garage rock and Brit-Pop, with more emphasis on the pop than the rock. This band is so obviously trying to be the next Strokes it's almost sad. Borrel's lyrics aren't half as good as they should be. A good line here and there, but for the most part his lyrics are easily forgettable, just like the rest of this album."
2,Mediocre,"I first saw Razorlight on the Live 8 DVD and really liked the two songs they performed. In addition, the band had a pretty cool stage presence. Consequently, I rushed out and bought this CD fully expecting to be mind blown. Unfortunately, I was nearly put to sleep. Folks, in the big picture of the musical universe, there's minimal talent on this CD - anyway you look at it. To make matters worse, Johnny Borrell claims to be as good a songwriter as Bob Dylan. Anyone in the music business dumb enough to make a statement like that has lost all credibility."
2,Don't Buy This One!,"This video card is the one that shipped with my Mac Pro. It was really good 5 years ago. If you do a search, you'll see that this video card has a tendency to fail. Most people had to replace it within the first 2 years. I was lucky and it lasted 5 (hence the 2 stars). Other than that, it never was a great performer and now has completely crapped out on me. It is noisy and tends to get clogged up with dust very easily. This plugs up the heatsink and overheats the GPU. In order to completely clear out the dust, you have to completely take apart the card's plastic housing to the point where you've exposed the GPU. This means you must work in a static-free manner. A lot of upkeep for a video card (and probably why I was able to keep it alive this long)If you're in the market to get a new video card, get the MC742ZM/A (http://www.amazon.com/Apple-ATI-Radeon-5770-MC742ZM/dp/B003Z6QH6M) instead. It's a little cheaper and has 1 gb of VRAM."
5,A most comprehensive resource.,"Barry Sammons breaks down the windmill pitching motion in a manner that is easy to understand, yet completely thorough. The structure of the book helps you learn the entire motion, or go directly to a specific area of concern. The discussions, drills, and diagrams give you a level of detail you don't get from most videos. I highly recommend this book for anyone serious about fastpitch."
3,coach recommended this,"i'm not sure about you, but i'm more of a hands on learner so reading about technique only helps so much when you really need to learn the proper form and gain the muscle memory."
3,"Just another softball pitching book...OK, but not great.","I've read many a book on softball pitching, and most of them tend to be promotions for the ""cover girl."" At least this one gave a little more. My disappointments deal with not being able to transfer much of this into mens' fastpitch. There are subtle and not so subtle differences in the games, and there are other pitches in the repertoire with men, as well as differences in the movements that this didn't capture. I expected more from a former mens' pitcher and coach, than coverage only of the womens' game. Maybe it was the promo on it that misled me. Either way, I didn't get what I was looking for. But you don't teach men the way you teach women."
4,Entertaining With Wine,The book was in great condition and is a wonderful cook book with one of the best choucroute recipes I have ever made. Nice background information on wine.
4,Very nice quality,The A Frame Duffel was of very good quality but somewhat smaller than anticipated (even though the measurements told us the exact size. Would recommend it especially at the price for a leather bag.
3,Nice bag; leather too soft,"Just got the bag- it's ok, but I did expect it to be rigid and hold its shape even when empty- instead it droops and collapses like a flat tire . When I grab it by the handles and fill it up I guess it looks ok . The leather is very soft like glove leather. Oh well , just trying to let you know what to expect."
4,Last Season...,"As many viewers points out this is the weakest of all the seasons simply there's only 7 episodes not enough to really gauge the a full 20 shows season would be like. Also disappointing is that Kenneth Johnson was to properly end the show had there been a full season, we only now have the telefilm ""Death of the Incredible Hulk"" as a final chapter to this wonderfully crafted television series. Here's to Bill Bixby the once and always HULK (and David Banner too)."
5,Love this show,What else to say? One of the best shows ever. grew up on Lou and Bill Bixby. Still is my favorite show today but appreciate it more so today.
4,A VERY SHORT SEASON BRINGS THE SERIES TO AN END!,"As I stated in my reviews of the other 4 seasons of this cult favorite TV series, this is very loosely based on the classic Marvel Comic icon. This season was cut short and because of this it only includes 7 episodes. This time around the Golly Green Giant gets to play some baseball, stop a political assassination and run with a few female convicts who escape from prison.To fill out the box set there is a behind the scenes documentary and a gag reel, but it would have been nice if they included the later Hulk TV movies! The episodes I've watched so far are quite laughable!.....But fans of the series keep the flame alive regardless!Hulk Smash!!!!!"
5,the last Hulk dvd,the last episodes complete one of the best Fugitive(my favorite show)style series. Bill Bixby reminds you of one fine actor and the bloopers reminds you that he was very funny
4,Great Customer Service,This product was sent out and delivered expediantly and arrived well before the cut off date. I enjoy doing business with go-hastings.
2,Big entertainment let down,"I pride myself on being a movie connossieur. I like all genres, especially, horror, thrillers and sci-fi movies. I purchased this movie because of the editorial review that I read on both Amazon and on the DVD jacket itself. Despite the hype, it was not quite what I had expected. I enjoyed Terminator alot better than this movie. The plot and the special effects are much to be desired. Gratuitous sex? Yes. Entertainment value? Gets a 2 star rating from me. Definitely, not one of the better pictures I have seen."
3,old movies are COOL!,Quite a long time ago this movie was state of the art and in hot contention with the movies of the day. It was a joy to see it released again and is welcomed into my selection of what I call BOBBY VISION FILMS-who is departed OFF WORLD- Saturday afternoon BEJOUES.
1,"Boring - cheap imitation of ""Blade Runner.""","This is a very poor rip-off of Blade Runer. Minimal plot - dark sets in a ravaged New York. A ""replicant"" this time being a bunch of art-work hardware to which the female artist attaches a found robot head - the whole thing becoming alive killing everyone in her apartment. A 20 minute plot stretched out 'forever.' Don't bother watching it. Oh, and the XXX dialog doesn't help a bit!"
2,I don't get it.,This movie put me to sleep. I tryed to watch it three times. Maybe I just need more coffee.
1,SILLY 80S HORROR,"total waste of time. this is a product of the 80s with very bad effects, ridiculous soundtrack and simple minded story.it get good reviews only because it is ""old classics"". new movies like this are dismissed imediatelly.p.s. and i really love d-horror movies where the bad guy comes alive again and again, really scary!!!"
1,DVD problems,"Somthing wrong with the DVD.Waited for this to come out in dvd and when youn insert disk in player it skips,tried cleaning it, this really sucks.Buyer beware."
3,Average R-rated movie or a XXX porno?,"I'm not into movies about the post-apocalypse and robots with homicidal tendencies, but i could watch the shower and sex scene over and over again since i know us ladies wish we were the actress senor mcdermott was making bacon with. of course, i did ask myself if i was watching your average R-rated movie or a porno because of the form of the sex and if a techno-like song was the type of music to have sex to. although in all honesty, out of all the sex scenes i've seen in movies, that was the hottest one ever and the shower scene was pretty damn hot, too."
3,Finally sees the light of it's disc release.,"This was a neat little low-budget, sci-fi/horror film that came out in the very early nineties. It has one of those post ""Road Warrior"" production design aesthetics, where ""if it's all junky-looking, it must be a bombed-out future."" It was based on a story from the British tabloid comic ""2000 A.D."" and if you were a comics fan back then you knew that was the comic that introduced characters like ""Judge Dredd"", ""Strontium Dog"", ""Rogue Trooper"" and other post-apocalyptic heroes and stories. Eventually they were sued by the publishers of that comic for not properly getting the rights to the story. The movie was also significant for being among the first movies to get the NC-17 rating. It pushed the edge back then and it still holds up now."
5,THE CABINET,I CAN NOT AGREE WITH CARL SHIELDS MORE.TIM BROCK HAS DONE AN EXCELLANT JOB IN EXPLORING THE PSYCOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS FILM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE STRING QUARTET.I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF THIS FILM SINCE I FIRST SAW IT IN 1972 AND A PROPONENT FOR THE STRING QUARTET AS A MUSICAL FORM IN PARTICULAR.THE EFFORTS OF MR. BROCK AND THE BRAVURA STRING QUARTET ARE MEANINGFULL ADDITIONS TO BOTH THE FILM AND THE MEDIUM.E-MAIL: CHILLER@NYC.RR.COM
4,good basic guide for pacing,"Like the format, and is easily readable. Would recommend it for Cath lab staff, office staff as well as physicians looking for basic practical tips for pacing."
4,Easy for the children to use,This book gives the children extensive instructions for using this book. It really maximizes what they get out of the it.
1,the book I received has bad quality,"I am not happy at the book I received. the hard cover is upside down, and many pages inside have been cut. Many pages' page number have been cut off. The quality of the book is bad. I don't know how to return it, otherwise, I am going to return.I am very unhappy about this order."
1,This software deserves a zero!,The advertisements and the box say that it copies Hollywood movies. When I tried to copy one of my movies it told me that it could not copy a copy-protected DVD and it recommended finding shareware that would first decrypt the software. What a rip-off!This software is buggy too. It crashes often while writing to the disc and ruins it. Don't waste your money!
1,This software is worthless - Waste of Money,"Company claims that ICOPYDVDS2 "" allows you to make high quality copies of virtually ANY DVD movie"" . When you try to copy movie it tells you it can't because of copy protection, and suggest you download a shareware program called DVD43. The claim that it will copy any DVD is very deceptive. I installed on a laptop that has Windows Vista, turns out version I received didn't support Vista, but newer version was available at company's website for download, fair enough. I download and install the later version, but turns out the DVD43 shareware program needed to use this product does not support Vista. I did get it to work with Win 2000, but then I find out the Basic version does don't record episode DVDs. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,I copy DVD 2,Not recomended with Vista I have a copy of theis with XP and it did great very disappointed with it now is not campatible with vista.
3,Ok but..,"I bought this book, hoping to use it with my elementary students. I think it is a bit over their heads. It is ok for older students but I would not recommend it for elementary students."
5,Great Gift,"I gave this book as a gift to a family that reads books aloud every night. The children are ages 8 and 10. The parents are educators. The family went through the book in 2 weeks and the parents have reported the book is ""fantastic"" The 8 year old has been retelling the myths to me daily! I highly recommend this book."
2,not age-appropriate,"This book is NOT for 5-year-olds. I look forward to when my child is a couple years older but, for now, this volcabulary is beyond a kindergarten level and not at all geared to that age group. I totally agree with other reviews about it being well-written, and I'm sure that these people's seventh graders do indeed enjoy it, but I think it's ridiculous to advertise this as a book for 5 and up!"
5,Battle City is amazing,"I know everyone keeps saying, ""Why do you buy the dub? The Japanese is better, because there's blood and violence, and blah blah blah."" Well, I'm a female college freshman, and I think the dub is just fine.This DVD contains one of the best duels EVER in the series - Yami Malik v. Mai - and easily the best duel of the Battle City Finals. Yami Malik is ridiculously annoying, but his strategy in this duel is genius.This is the third duel in the Battle City Finals (after Yami Bakura v. Yami Yugi and Rishid (Odion) v. Joey).I HIGHLY recommend this DVD for anyone who is a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh!, because Battle City was easily the greatest season."
5,yehaaaaaaaaaa,right after the duel with odion meriks dark side was reveled and now the evil marik is out he duels mia for a shadow game. when ever she loses life points a person she cares about fades away in her memory. will mia beat merik or will she be sent to the shadow realm losing a person she cares about 1 by 1.
1,Simple way to filter out junk telescopes from the decision process....,"A useful rule of thumb for determining maximum useable magnfication for a telescope is 50x per inch (or about 2x per millimeter).A 3inch scope is useable to about 150x, or maybe a little more with a very good scope.This scope is advertised as giving up to 525x.Any scope which is advertised as giving such overinflated magnification claims is safely classified as ""junk"".Don't buy scopes based on magnification claims."
2,Terrible instuctions!,Two college graduates could not understand the terrible instuctions for assemby. Th box lies when it says 2 easy assembly steps.We still haven't got it together so we can't comment on the telescpoe itself.
3,works good.,Works good for the most part. Could use an additional brush for the bottom for boots that do not have smooth soles.
5,Getting to know St Catherine,"Before dying of aneroxia in 1380 the famed Dominican tertiary forged an extraordinary legend. She was in her time a woman of substantial political clout. In 1376 she helped urge Pope Gregory XI, then living ignominously at Avignon, to Return to Rome. In where later, and through the strength of her voice and conviction, and amid turbulence. She counceled the Pope Urban VI through a wicked Church Schism, and through the dissipation of Urban's fanatical reign. A young charismatic woman in a world being destroyed by men. (...) in '15 days of Prayer with St Catherine of Siena' by Chantal van der Plamke and Andre Knockaert, I find a new saint that I barely knew before. This book is a little jewel for the inner life. Full of wisdom always hinting at Catherine's favorite urges: Truth and Humility. It has a wonderful preface deliniating Catherine's life. A very original course. The book is part of a series that includes St Teresa of Avila, etc."
4,"Well constructed, a bit small",This is a great bag. I just wish it was larger or if there was another size offering from this company.
5,Soap Opera's Greatest Love Themes,"This CD contains some of the best loved theme songs from our favorite shows. This really made me smile;because I can remember watching most of these TV shows represented. Thorn and Macy's song "" This Time Around"", ""Bold and The Beautiful"", ""Dallas"",""Knots Landing"" and ""Nadia's Theme from Young and the Restless"" are just a few of the songs you will here on this CD. It was a nice trip down memory lane. I really enjoyed this CD."
5,history of leech township,The book was received in very good condition. It contains history of an area where my grandparents farmed. I was very pleased with the ease of finding this book.
4,Good But........,"We have had this wagon for a year now. It is still wheeling along, but the paint is peeling off and there are a few spots of rust and the wooden stakes on the sides are almost off too. The review says not to use it for rocks and firewood because the rails are small. I would have to add to that list a 28 pound 2 year old that just can't sit still because that has made the wood railings come off also. I guess for one of their lower end wagons it was a good deal while it lasted but I am looking into a larger more comfortable one now. THe wheels on this one are quite small and hard to manuever unless you are on the street. (it is nearly impossible to get up and down off the sidewalk if there is no built in ramp) And don't even bother pulling it through grass. Spend the extra money and get one of the all terrain wheeled wagons.... it will be worth it!!"
4,I feel like a kiddo again!,"We bought this for our daughter who just turned one.....along with the padding which I think is a necessity....and she just loves to go for walks in her wagon! My husband and I love to watch her lean back and relax in her big comfy wagon. This is a great, sturdy toy that lives up to the Radio Flyer name!"
2,Did not meet expectation,"This is the fourth Radio Flyer that I have purchased (for grandchildren, as they arrive). Unfortunately, the woodwork was substandard (someone had tried to patch a couple of bad spots and did a lousy job of it).I need some guidance in returning the defective parts for replacement."
4,Not just a toy,I have rheumatoid arthritis. I get groceries once a month because I have to drive 40 miles to the nearest grocery store. Carrying bags of groceries in was difficult for me and took many trips. Using this wagon to carry groceries in has made things much easier for me. I can get everything in in two to three trips. I love this wagon. I also have a larger wagon for pet food because I buy the large bags.
5,Radio Flyer Trav-ler Review,"I bought this wagon for my niece for Christmas, and it was so great to see her eyes light-up when she saw it. It is a great toy and a lot of fun for the kids (and me!). It also is a good alternative to transporting a young child outside and not in a carriage. The only part of the wagon that can be hazardous is the black handle. If you leave it in an upwards position, it may fall to the fall, and it is quite heavy. Other than that, great toy."
4,A Spiritual Journey and a Love Story,"Zimmerman writes a compelling memoir of his own spiritual journey and finding love. Although the book is not particularly well-written, it is a fast and heart-warming read that will keep you up late at night and reevaluating your own spiritual needs. It inspires to ignore external pressures and begin an inner search for true happiness and contentment."
4,Good Collection but..........................,"I have been a fan of Shaggy since I first heard ""Oh Carolina"" and I love this Greatest Hits collection but for one track. On my album back, it says that Janet Jackson sings ""Luv Me Luv Me"" with him.This cannot be true for the version on this album as it sounds absolutely nothing like Janet nor like the Track that was on the ""How Stella got her Groove back"" Soundtrack. It may just be my copy of the disc, but somehow I doubt it. This fact prevents me from giving this release the five stars it rightly deserves.Other than this song, the album is ""SWEET"". His Maxi Priest collaborations among others are timeless and the two versions of ""Mr. Boombastic"" don't hurt this compilation either."
2,This is his best?,"I got this cheap, so I decided to risk purchasing it from what I'd heard on the radio- either this isn't his best music, or he's seriously deficient on ideas."
3,Desisions...,"This is an excellent cd for teens and adults but not so hot for kids because of the content, I personally like it but I like pretty much all music? depends on the age group actullaly!"
1,"ARE YOU FREAKING ""SIRIUS""???!!!","It's bad enough that I have to give this even one star just to leave the review. This sounds like complete trash. As if the mic that the ""singer"" used was his computer mic, and that the band is using toy instruments intended for 5 year olds (who were probably the ones that wrote the lyrics).If they had fun making it, then that's great, but I'd hate to see anyone pay money for this."
1,coffee beans,Coffee beans did not seem fresh. No oil on them what so ever. I have tasted much better and fresher. Will not order again.
5,Everything you wanted to know and a whole lot more.,"You really need to rest up before taking on this book. It is so full of information, the minute you think,""yeah..but what about...."" there it is. Schama has created a book that encompasses every detail of Dutch culture and puts the information in such a way that it nearly walks you through the history of these people and introduces you to them. An excellent book for college classes and study groups."
5,Riches,Excellent. Gives you an insight into one of the most i nteresting cultures the world has known.
2,Tough sledding and not for amateurs,"I cannot say if this book is good or not. I have waded through one hundred pages and know that reading ten books a week for twenty-five or thirty years has left me insufficiently prepared for the verbal density. It is up there on the shelf next to William Gass, and I plan to pull it down the next time I feel strong enough."
2,LOUD - cleaning solution hard to find,"I asked for a jewelry cleaner for christmas and recieved this one as a gift. It is very loud when operating and the lid vibrates because it does not shut tight. I have to put a heavy book on top of it to keep the noise down. Also it only comes with four cleaning soultion packets and suggests that you change the solution at each use. The solution is somewhat hard to find.I only gave this two stars because it DOES get my rings sparkling, but with the loud operation and hard to find solution I would not reccomend it."
4,Interesting.,"A nice little insight into some of the questions that people had about life during the High Renaissance in Florence, Italy. Nice for history students who want to see into the minds of people of the time. Language is easy and the story is enjoyable."
5,Great for teaching,"Manetti's story provides a rare glimpse into daily life, comedy, and the formation of identity in Renaissance Florence. It also adds some flesh to the character of Filippo Brunelleschi and gives an idea of how contemporaries must have viewed him."
2,sigh,"There is low budget, then there is no budget. This falls into the latter. I think they used my 10 year old daughter for the makeup artist, they could have upgraded by asking my 15 year old. Graphics from a commodore 64, and the set was filmed in my garage, just shifting the set walls a few times, and filmed on a old Sony VHS camcorder.Actual basis of the movie is kinda unique, and could be expanded to make a decent movie..provided they can actually get a budget."
1,no no,"movie was ridiculous, no acting or storyline that made any kind of sense would NOT recommend this to anyone -"
3,Smelled Nice But Didn't Last Long,"This ""garbage pal"" is a scented packet that sticks onto the inside of a garbage lid. It smelled great every time we opened the lid. The scent is supposed to last six months, however the packet fell or was tugged off after only a week of use. It fell into the garbage and was lost. However, to be fair I can't completely blame the packet because we have an industrial push/swing garbage lid that comes in contact with the trash more often than most garbage cans. If your garbage can lid is one of the flip-up types this might work great for you. I really do highly recommend the lovely scent."
3,Doesn't stick,"I love the scent of the siege garbage pals - it keeps the garbage can from smelling horrible between cleanings. However, it fell off the inside of the lid of 2 of my flip-lid garbage cans within a day or two. The adhesive is obviously not very good. I had to use masking tape to keep the packets from falling off."
4,Wow! Great cd!,"I recently rediscovered this album in my closet and pulled it out, dusted it off, and played. I can't believe that I slept on this one for so long! It is a great album! I remember picking it up in late 2000 when it came out. The songs are catchy and will have you hitting the repeat button. One song that definately stands out right away is ""Wish"", it has a fun chorus that will have you singing along! There are some ballads that are really good like ""Wrong To Let You Go"", ""I Know You're Going To Break My Heart"". The songs are very pop, with a bit of alternative, and some electronica thrown in for good measure. The lead singer, Roberta Carter Harrison, has a voice that is beautiful and distinct and captivating. Other highlights include ""Lucky Day"", ""Wake"", ""Twist"", ""All I want"", ""Jaded"", and more. Check it out! They are a great group worth listening to!"
3,Disappointing,"I was thrilled to find this book b/c I'm always looking for appetizer ideas that don't involve meat and love vegetarian cooking.Unfortunately, I've tried multiple recipes from this book and just have not been impressed. The pictures are nice but the food itself isn't particularly tasty--generally fairly bland, uninteresting, and boring. Many of the recipes are too complex to be practical when you need to make up an appetizer for a party. I've owned it for 2 or 3 years but I'm going to purge it because I just have been so disappointed with the recipes and choices of appetizers. Of the 20 or so vegetarian cookbooks (and a few non-vegetarian ones) on my shelf now, this is the only one I'd give away."
5,best highlighter ever,"I have used Zazzle highlighters for years and can honestly say they are worth every penny. I just bought a dozen and gave out four to co-workers and employees. These highlighters last and never dry out like the ""cheap ones"". Don't hesitate buy these, you won't regret the purchase."
3,ANNOYING TO USE,"I PURCHASED THESE EXPENSIVE HIGHLIGHTERS BECAUSE THEY ADVERTISED THAT THEY USED LONG LASTING INK.I USE THEM TO HIGHLIGHT BIBLES, AND COMMENTARIES TO FACILITATE LOOKING UP REFERENCES.THESE ARE QUITE EXPESIVE WHEN COMPARED TO MOST OTHERS BUT I WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR PERMANENT MARKING.I FIND THAT KEEPING THE INK FLOWING WHILE HIGHLIGHTING IS SUCH A CHORE THAT IT TAKES MY ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE CONTENT I AM READING. I WILL NOT BE REORDERING THESE.THE INK DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG MAKING THE ""REAL"" COST EVEM HIGHER.I HAVE NOW LOCATED A SOURCE (THROUGH AMAZON)THAT CARRIES THE TANK STYLE HIGHLIGHTERS WITH THE NON FLORESENT YELLOW INK THAT DOES NOT FADE OUT IN A MONTH OR TWO. LOCAL STORES DON'T CARRY THEM ANY MORE.THESE ZEBRA HIGHLIGHTERS MIGHT BE JUST WHAT YOU WANT, BUT THEY ARE NOT FOR ME"
5,Exactly what the first word of its title states: Lessons.,"I've heard Pat Livingston speak many times. One of the key lessons she learned from life is the question: What have I learned from life? What can I learn from this experience? In her book she tells the reader many of her experiences and what ""the Lesson"" was. Surprise -- I found myself stepping back from my everyday experiences and saying, ""Now what can I learn from this?""She's a good speaker. Now I see that she's an excellent writer -- because as I read I wasn't noticing the writer, I was hearing the speaker -- speaking from her heart -- speaking her lessons, her learnings, from everyday moments.Andy Costello"
2,Extensively abridged,"This edition is very severly abridged, to the extent that it is meaningless. Before I began reading the Diary, I read Claire Tomalin's ""Samuel Pepys, The Unequalled Self"" which is excellent! She quoted extensively from the Diary as well as providing the historical and personal background that is crucial to understanding what and whom Pepys was writing about. There are entries that she quotes extensively, for example Monck's move against the Rump Parliment on February 11, 1660, which contains more information than the ""selected passage"" in the Diary. Aside from a very few meaningful passages, this edition is filled with short snippets of trivial activities of the day. It contains no heart, no soul which is what made the Diary famous in the first place. Instead of this book, I recommend Ms. Tomlin's book which is available at this very same botique."
5,This is the most helpful priceguide especially for beginners,"I have learned so much,especially with the interviews and could quickly see all the hard work that had gone into this price guide. I would call it a price guide,but it is so much more than that. It has helped me a great deal and I appreciate all the hard work and research that went into this. Thank you Jim Jenkins for helping others when Roseville needs an expert. I give this book five stars and would give more if I could."
2,Definitely not for the beginning Roseville collector!,"There are no pictures of the different lines of Roseville. If you don't know the difference in appearance between white rose, clematis, futura, vista forest, etc., you're out of luck. I also thought the book was way too expensive for the quality and size."
3,i liked it,i kindagot this as an inside joke but i was expecting it to be bigger its like the size of a hand towel and also be sure to wash it sepretly the black lettering dose bleed.
3,Gag gift only IMO,My girlfriend got this as a gag gift; and thats all I would use it forThe material isn't very soft...If you're like me and look to treat your lady (and yourself) nice during romantic times; you Won't appreciate the 'Scratch Factor' of this towel
3,Great gag gift,"This was a great gag gift for my husband. I expected it to be a bigger towel (the picture is a little deceiving), but other than that it made for great laughs."
1,less than expected,"The good thing about this book is that the information is all listed in alphabetical order. I was very disappointed when I read it: has little info about what the title suggests, but is instead the authors list of comparisons or tidbits of items from different beliefs, most have little or nothing to do with the idea of death and afterlife. Is this all he has to offer? It does not compare in any way to Raymond Moody or others who have written insightful and informative books and manage to stick to the subject. Maybe I just wish the book had a title that would reflect the actual info in the book. I'd like to get my money back."
3,"Amazing design, bad weight distribution","This was the first PG gundam i have built, and, to be honest, this model kit was a little different than expected. I, unfortunately, mean this in a negative way.Here are my likes and dislikes:+ I LOVE THE DESIGN!!!!!+ More detailed than what i expected= Rather time consuming to build (I was able to finish this within 3 days, but its rather justiable because there are a crapload of parts- The weight distribution is quite off, so this model kit is more for display over posing- The parts remain very durable for a few days, then everything starts falling apart (Aargh!)Verdict: If you liked Endless Waltz and this version of Wing Zero, this is a must buy, but for big Gundam model collectors, this should only be used for display not posing"
4,Awesome Kit,I just finished with this kit and having done a few pg kits prior i know what I like and what i dont. It is a beautiful kit once it is complete all though some of the parts dont stay one quite as well as I would like but nothing the super glue trick doesnt fix. I painted mine black and gold and it is awesome. The only massive downside to this kit is the wiring. I had it working perfectly and once it was all put together somthing inside must have shifted and the chest wont light up now. being the jerk that I am I am not taking it all back apart to fix this lol. The wiring takes precision and I would not recomend this for new gundam builders. However if you can over look its small flaws it is a great addition to have.
4,Beautiful,"This kit is my perfect grade, and I must say it looks beautiful. Took me around 28 hrs to build plus another 2 for panel lining. I highly recommend you do panel line it and finish it with a clear flat coat and you won't be disappointed."
4,PG Wing Zero Custom,"This product is really not for beginners. The chest and eyes light up, and both connect to the same battery back on the back of the gundam. The wiring is a bit messy, and requires precision to make sure it works. This is a beautiful kit, and once you finish it, find a pose you like and stick with the pose. The only downside of this gundam is that a lot of pieces do not really stay on the kit.The kit comes with two sabres, and it's trademark twin rifle blaster. The wing tips are made of flexible metal coated with rubber. Fingers are individually jointed and the overall kit is very detailed."
1,"Right Discription, wrong picture","You do know you hand the wrong picture. While the dispriction talks about the XXXG-00W0 Wing Gundam Zero, the pic it shows is a AMSiA Gat-X105 Strike Gundam (although it's a neat looking figure, and I'd love to get my hands on one, hell...I'll just find the G-Weapons in that format!)"
1,Misleading description.....,The item description mentions something about the King being on your hand. Its more like the King in front of your hand. This is a finger puppet and about all you can make him do is clap. A very nicely dressed finger puppet...I must admit. There are concealed openings at the back of each of the King's arms to insert fingers and one in the back of his head to fit a fingertip. He is best used as a pretend doll. If you're looking for an actual hand puppet... you will be dissapointed.
3,I Would Use This in My Church,"Stephen M. Miller has done it again! He's put the cookies on the bottom shelf. They are yummy, easy to digest, and full of fun.The ""cookies"" in this case are the insightful explorations of some of the dumb moves biblical characters made in their lives. Their boo-boos are good lessons for us to learn. Miller makes these characters and their dilemmas understandable, even humorous.These vignettes are excellent explanations of important faith issues, suitable for a wide range of readers--new Christians, older teens, college/career persons, and even older Christians who want a refreshing refresher course.So, I encourage you to reach for the delicious ""cookies"" and enjoy. (Sorry, no chocolate chips or Macadamia nuts included.)"
4,Don't read this book alone.,"Stephen Miller's Big Dummies of the Bible is the quintessential book for a discussion group. Hot topics. Great background information. Fun to read. Written with a big dollop of humor. This book deals with the ""S"" word in a 21st century way that even a fellow dummy can understand.Rev. Bill Calvin"
4,Sizing a bit big,"It's hard to find these, but they do work. Be wary of the size however, I am 5'9 and 165lbs and these are a tad too big. If you're smaller than my general size definitely get the smaller one's or they'll fly off your wrists."
2,Where are the large ones ?,Why is there no longer a link to the large ones ? I cant get my hands through these medium ones
2,Misleading,"When I purchased this item from Amazon.com, I was expecting to get a VHS tape of a Canadian cartoon called, ""Stickin Around"". What I found out and got instead is a VHS tape titled, ""The Heavens are Opened"" from something called ""The Docudrama of the Restoration"". It has something to do with a family learning about the importance of God and all that stuff (I think).I never opened it 'cause I'm planning on returning this to get my money back.It might be a good watch, but if you're trying to sell something, don't put the title of another series to another program in your description! I understand it's my fault for not looking at it clearly, but I shouldn't have to read every fine print on a product to see if it's legit!I sent an e-mail to the person about this issue and they stated to send it back so I can get a refund.Don't have much else to say. It came in good condition, though."
1,Time to Quilt,"I was looking for ideas and tips for a quilt retreat. There are a few in the book, but it is more quilting than retreat planning. I was disappointed in the book."
4,"Inexpensive, good digital camera","This camera is just what I wanted: a functional digital camera that was inexpensive and easy to use. It operates like a regular camera--there is no LCD to have a quick look at your shots. The flash is very bright. Downloading pictures to my iBook is quick (via the USB port and iClick-provided cord) and I can import them with the iPhoto program already on my Mac. I purchased a 128MB SD Sandisk memory card from a third party which works great.The camera is very light--there's not much to it. All in all, it's what I wanted and expected for the money."
1,"""A"" Number One Prime Plastic Crap","This thing is the kind of free promotional crap you get for subscribing to a magazine, or something. The free prize for going to a time-share sales pitch. It takes mediocre pictures, and the software tries to install ad and spyware on your computer. It's just not worth the money. Go buy a real camera for the same money."
1,I was sold pass use by date candy - Beware,The Health Candy Bars from Amason were just pass their use by date when I got them. I wonder if that is why they were discounted. It would be helpful to know before one buys a product if it is near or past the end of it used by date. it sure effects the value of the product. Amazon needs to fixed this.
5,Fave Candy,"I decided to buy this because the stores hardly ever have Heath Bars. I would have preferred to have regular single-packaged bars but the price on these was quite good. The king size is simply two regular 1.4 oz bars packaged together. The only problem (and I don't know who is to blame here) is that every single bar is broken -- some broken multiple times. Like I said I don't know if Amazon shipped them this way, or if it happened during shipment. They came in a box with those air bags but should have probably been shipped in peanuts or some other impact-absorbing material. Anyway it doesn't matter for just us nibbling on them at home, but it would matter if they were being using in gift baskets or something like that."
2,"cheap, easily broken","the good news: these seat covers look as vibrantly colored as in the picture, and those colors have been durable for months (the color has neither faded nor rubbed off onto anyone's clothes).the bad news: the catches underneath them that hold them down to the seat are made of the lightest weight plastic possible. straps designed to wrap under the car seat itself clip closed with these flimsy catches, which are supposed to hold the sitting part of the cover firmly down to the car seat. we bought a pair of seat covers for the front of our Rogue, and one of the catches broke as we installed the covers and the other broke about a week later. the backs of these covers of course stay right in place, but the seat part slips all over now - you don't end up with the neat, tailored look in the picture."
1,This gun isn't worth the money you pay for it,"I bought this gun at Target because the whole auto with clips sounded fun. I got it home and the gun was so hard to pump the my 11 year old and 9 year old couldn't pump it. I was able to pump it up so the kids could fire it, so I had to pump it for them. If you pumped it enough the gun fired and was really cool, but the 5 minutes of pumping up the gun wasn't work the 5 seconds of firing you got out of the gun. Once you fired the gun once all of the air was out of the gun so if you didn't pump it enough to get all of the darts to shoot out then you had to start all over. Needles to say my arm was really sore the next day from pumping up the gun for the kids all evening and I took it back to the store for a refund."
1,Nice Idea... Poor Execution....,"This gun stinks... The idea of a clip-fed, air-powered gun sounded like a great idea, however, once again Hasbro has screwed up the execution. Good thing I opened this gun up and checked it before wrapping it as a Christmas gift! I loaded this gun up, snapped in the clip, and pumped it up the 25-30 times as suggested by the manual. I pulled the trigger for a second, three darts fired, two misfired. I pulled the trigger again, out of air! I pumped it back up about 20 times... pulled the trigger... guess what? I couldn't fire the remaining darts! This is the design flaw in the gun... Since the clip drops back into the gun, the gun cycles back through the already fired darts and air is lost through each of those empty slots. There just wasn't enough air to lift the clip and fire the remaining darts. Horrible design!!!!"
3,Eddie & The Cruiser: The UNRELEASED Tapes?,"Since Eddie & the Cruisers were a fictional band to begin with, the idea of a collection of unreleased material stretches the truth a bit.These are actually unreleased outtakes and new recordings by John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band, the group that provided all of the music for the semi-legendary Eddie & the Cruisers.Most of Cafferty's best songs appeared on the soundtrack to the film, so several of the songs here sound like leftoversRegardless, they are performed with conviction by The Beaver Brown Band who were, in reality, an above average bar band."
3,A gifted and promising writer.,"Crescent City Rhapsody envisions a world transformed by nanotechnology and art. This intriguing novel explores many of the sins of the moderns age--child prostitutes in Asia, clandestine government operations, sexism, agism and the legacy of slavery.The various protagonists of the story suffer in various degrees from some aspect of modern culture. Their talents allow them to contribute to the changes brought about by the breakdown of old technology caused by interference from extraterrestrials. The new technology transforms both cities and individuals.This was an enjoyable read. The first half of the book was more compelling as our heroes struggled with the breakdown of culture and the resulting change. The second half as things were starting to come together was not as interesting but I definitely wanted to know what happened at the end."
1,Do not use for canning,"If you want these for decor, go for it. But do not use them for canning. Initially, all but one (out of 12) jar sealed when I went through the canning process. I kept them in a pantry for about a week, and all but two of the tops popped. I bought these because I wanted to try the new, attractive jar for canning...but don't do it. It is a waste of time and product to use these for canning."
2,Cute but not comfortable,"I purchased these shoes because I thought they were adorable. However, I had to return them because as cute as they were, they felt more like shoeboxes than shoes. Very uncomfortable!"
4,Awesome Cd,"This cd is great! These guys are from Calgary, Alberta -Canada-. They have a rockish type sound. A sound that's truly Canadian! The lyrics are totally original, but the melody reminds me of Nine Days or See Spot Run(another Canadian band) or Neve. Their songs that have been put on the radio are Holiday & Overexposure. But my favorite song is Sleepwalking Sister. I loved this cd all the songs are new & great!"
5,Read years ago; Relevant today,"What you hear often when people are talking about education is: ""So and so could get better educational reults-- if only they had MORE MONEY!"" (This is a notion that has been repeated by the NEA so many times that it has taken on a life of its own.) But, Sowell, ever the person to test statements against empirical evidence has asked the question: ""Is that really the case?"" And from there he goes on to demonstrate that the US spends more money per capita when it comes to education than almost every place else and gets lesser results. The evidence for this goes on for quite a while (the length of the whole book), and so there is no need for me to restate it here. But the whole book is worthwhile if for no other reason than to deal with what has ACTUALLY happened as opposed to what people ASSUME to have happened in a quest to secure more money for themselves."
5,Your jaw will drop reading parts of this book,"I've read and enjoyed several of Sowell's ""economic"" focused books so I thought it would be interesting to get his perspective on this important topic. Wow, I was expecting great insights and different ideas but what I got was much better. The book is getting a bit dated now but if half the examples he writes about are true, and I think they are, our educational system is an absolute timebomb. Changing the mindset of educators/administrators takes time but I hope some of them have read this book. I have three daughters and this book, quite frankly, is EYE OPENING. Highly recommend and I really hope it's not that bad out there."
4,Where's Lisa?,"A Great Yet Incomplete Collection of Willie Bobo... How could the producers of this alblum not include Lisa, Black Coffee, and other great songs. It has other classics: Fried Neckbones & Some Homefries, Evil Ways, & Grazing in the Grass. And, It has several more great songs: Sham TIme, Juicy, and some Afro-Cuban & Acid Jazz tunes. (Ones that you can't find on his albums or on a single disk.)But, simply how could they not include one of Latin Jazz's greatest songs: Lisa."
2,Mainly cheesy titles & production,"Willies a fine percussionist & there no doubting theres some choice cuts on this record (Spanish Grease, La Descarga Del Bobo)but if you like authentic Latin/Salsa/roots, this is not your pick. Cheesy song selection, strings & pop covers make this more akin to lounge music for the white shoe brigade or crisp fried Miami matriachs & their cheap suit toy boys. Best avoided in my opinion unless your planning a 60's themed Go-Go party."
5,Synopsis,"Every kid wants to be cool and fit in - life's a blast even when you're different. When Mo's reflection is revealed (Erik per Sullivan of malColm in the middle), he sees a body that doesn't quite resemble any of his peers. Here, he tells the tale of his youth, growing up on the south shore of Long Island, New York- How his parents support him, how his wacky brother keeps him laughing, and how his friends help him to escape. After discovering that the reason behind all of his physical differences is a genetic mutation called ""Marfan Syndrome"", Mo is forced to come to terms with a more serious reality: he will never be able to do many of the things that the people around him take for granted and he will have to prepare himself for a major heart surgery. As we venture away from our own realities, Mo takes us into his world of hanging out, discovering girls, dealing with school and the doctor's office, going to parties, trying sports, getting stoned, and contemplating God."
2,Yuck,"This is a terrible book for learning to read Chinese newspapers. All the newspaper articles are out of date, some of the terminology is outdated (according to my professor), there isn't enough space between the lines to write notes (this drives me NUTS), and the grammar explanations are almost completely incomprehensible. I did a lot better when I had a teacher explaining Chinese grammar to me in CHINESE than when I use this book to study Chinese grammar in ENGLISH. The book also switches between traditional and simplified, but only offers an alternative simplified version of the article when the article is in traditional (but none of the vocabulary is available in simplified!).Not recommended. Ever. The companion workbook is even worse. If you use this book, you'd better have an amazing teacher."
3,its decent,"The only major discomfort I have with the book is the format. For example, if one character has been introduced before but not the entire word, the book forces you to turn back and look at when the character was first mentioned. I don't understand why doesn't it just list the words invididually in order instead of by character. I hate having to flip back and forth because there are so many characters which makes it too annoying and slow. This book could definitely be more clear and concise when it comes to helping me learn Mandarin."
1,"No, No No .....do NOT buy this fake package!!","All tracks are re-recordings, NOT the originals!!! Yakety Yak by the Coasters sounds ok, but everything ELSE are not the versions you heard on the radio.!"
3,Rubber Ball,"I primarily bought this to get ""Rubber Ball""--number 1 on the second CD. Instead number 1 is ""In a Gadda da Vida"", which I could never stand to hear again, especially the drum solo. All other songs are correct as listed."
5,Excellent musical journey!,"I first heard John Klemmer in San Diego, CA, about 1981 in a live nightclub performance. I bought the vinyl album of Brazilia probably still have it around somewhere. It was a great joy to find it on CD."
4,For viewers interested in archaeology,"The first ten minutes of this video focus on Damascus. Unfortunately, it appears that the producers were kept out of the truly interesting things in Damascus, mosques and gardens. The public areas that they did film have been cluttered with photographs of the country's current dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and obsolete weapons (fighter planes, tanks, etc.) parked in front of public buildings. There is virtually no discussion of hotels and restaurants.The balance of the program consists of scenes of the truly impressive ruins in the Syrian countryside. Anyone considering an archaeological tour of Syria should benefit from watching it."
4,"Good TV, yet no Output plugs","I really like this tv. It was a great price given the size and quality. It has been in operation for over two years. One major complaint: There is not output ports. I want to run the stereo output through my DVD, but there is no option. One minor complaint: It is just about a half an inch too deep for my cabinet. ..."
4,Excellent for Beginner Bird Owners,"I recently acquired 2 gregarious parakeets (Budgies, more specifically) and have found this book to be a wonderful resource regarding the proper care of my new friends. It also offers a wealth of information about behavior (why they do some of the crazy things they do) and health propblems to be on the lookout for.I feel like a much better prepared bird owner having read this book, it was a great place to start."
2,Very weak,This book had a very weak plot. Ms. Dickerson tried to make Jennifer have problems with not having family roots therefore she was so sad and frightened that Micheal wouldn't want her. I think Micheal's character should have been a little more forceful. He seemed weak and unsure of himself. The situation with Tawana was kind of stupid. What man would believe that he impregnated a woman that's a known liar. This book just didn't strike any chords. She wrote alot about nothing. Very weak and unrealistic.
4,Very good case/holster combo for this huge phone,"Lightweight, compact, seems well constructed. Does not add to the size of the phone, so it still fits in a shirt pocket when not in the holster. Clip seems pretty solid to me; I am surprised that a few have had it break off. I would recommend this highly; a good case at a good price."
3,Pretty good but not perfect.,Clips onto my scrubs and protects the screen. It is very hard to put the phone in with the screen facing outwards though and equally difficult to get the phone out of the case. Some of the paint is chipping off and I've only had it for a week. My only wish was that they made it easier to put the phone into the holster with the screen facing outwards.
2,waste of money,Arrived on time but came apart in less than 24 hours of receiving it. I shouldnt have ignored the reviews...
1,consumer,upon receiving thiscase and attaching the belt clip to my belt it broke instantly do not buy this product if you need a belt cliphe returns are insanely difficult and not worth the aggravation do not I repeat do not buy
2,I want to love it,"There are so many good things about this case. The bad thing is that you cant use the phone facing out with the kickstand unless you take the back cover off first. Other covers that I have had you just flip it around and slide it in but with this one you actually have to take it out of the back cover to put it into the stand. Doesnt make sense to me. Other than that it is a great color, provides good protection, has a good clip and good grip."
3,I like this case,I have had this case for two weeks and like having the phone covered on both sides. The only problem is the clip already broke off. I like that it is thin and am still debating on getting another one. for the price it isnt bad.
2,Not impressed..it's painted black and it comes off easily,Don't bump it..the clip will pop right off..the black finish comes off in 1 month..it is white underneath..cheaply made item.
1,"garbage, stay away",DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. THE PIECE THAT HOLDS THE CASE TO THE BELT CLIP UNATTACHES VERY EASILY! PHONE DROPPED AND THE SCREEN SHATTERED. WASTE OF AN $800 PHONE. THANK YOU BOX WAVE!!
