3,"Excellent Book, Pathetic Editing","As usual for the past 15 years, the editors were asleep at the wheel and completely hosed the vital (to brain-damaged Linux) command line arguments -- at least on page 39 (Chapter 2: Adding a Larger Hard Disk to Your TiVo).If you're transferring everything over to a larger hard drive using the ""mfstool"" commands the correct arguments are as follows (I've used ""[space]"" to indicate a single space between commands):mfstool[space]backup[space]-o-[space]-a[space]/dev/hdb[space]|[space]mfstool[space]restore[space]-i-[space]-C[space]/dev/hddIdiot copyeditors and typesetters. Idiot editors in general."
3,Great sound,Pure Surround sound. Audio is great.Microphone is cheap and should have made it a boom mic. The microphone does not pickup from its location on the Cords.also doesnt have a seperate volume adjustment so you have to use the volume control with in windows or the game itself.Again great sound from the speakers and isnt too bulky.
5,Best bang for your buck,"If you're looking for a great sounding pair of surround sound headphones then look no farther, you've found them. The sound quality is excellent for any activity from gaming to watching movies to my favorite, listening to music. They are very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. For a set of surround sound headphones in the $50.00 USD and under price range these can't be beat.Pros* 1.Great sound quality* 2. Comfortable* 3. Long cord* 4. Cable clips for the microphone* 5. Excellent PriceCons* Absolutely None."
2,What a disappointment!,"After reading several glowing reviews on the web I decided that this would be perfect for my gaming needs.Boy was I wrong, the first thing I noticed was how ugly they looked, extremely big and clunky.Secondly NO inline sound control (which I knew already) is a huge negative if youre a gamer or listen to music.Now the worst part, the sound quality was garbage. Very weak and very low, not that much bass even after fidgeting with the equalizer.Sometimes sounds would echo which ruins the experience.Im returning these as we speak, very disappointed indeed.Save yourself the money and get regular stereo headphones instead."
1,"Warning, You can buy, but you won't be able to activate!","We saw this on the View, and thought what a terrific produt for our son. Unfortunately, you can't reach the company to turn on the phone. All you get is a message that repeats at 8am or 5 pm, what a rip off! We returned to Amazon after spending a week calling them at all times of the day."
1,"Good Idea, Bad Implementation","This phone was a real disappointment. We bought it so that we could find our child in the case of an emergency. The day that we actually needed to find our child, the gps showed him in another town 5 miles from our house!! He was in fact, 2 blocks away from our house. Second, the battery for the phone only held it's charge for a few hours (this is brand new out of the box). And third, it is extremely difficult to speak to someone in person at Wherify customer service. This has been a real waste of money."
3,Wherify Cell Phone/GPS Good Investment,"Purchased this phone via internet for my handicapped son, and when it arrived we thought it was very small, but surprised to find it worked just fine. The set-up was a little confusing and customer service isn't always available to help. But once we got going...all was well."
2,Perhaps not fair review.,This might be an unfair review as it perhaps falls too much on the vendor instead of the product.Never got to use the product as the features needed with activation from phone company wasn't available in Costa Rica.Description from vendor was misguiding as it said it could be used with any sim-card - which might be true but then it was ONLY possible to make calls from numbers saved on the sim-card and it was not possible to program the buttons on the phone.
1,Odd!,This doll is very odd.She:1. Is not Barbie anymore2. Has sticks in back3. Face is ugly4. Looks like a hoboI WOULD NEVER RECCOMEND ANY OF THESE DOLLS1 IT SUCKS THAT TRHET RE-NAMED BARBIE KENNEDY! THESE DOLLS ARE UGLY!-Smart Alleck(V.I.P.)
1,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?????,"THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN, THE DOLLS LOOK LIKE STREET HOOKERS AND HAVE FACES TO MATCH....WHY WOULD THEY EVER THINK THAT A CHILD WOULD WANT TO PLAY WITH A HOOKER....WHAT MESSAGES ARE WE SENDING TO OUR CHILDERN....""IT'S OK LIL SUSAN, IF YOU WANT TO BE A HOOKER MOMMY SUPPOSRTS YOU"" DO NOT SUPPORT THEM WITH THE DANG DOLL!!!!!!!!"
5,Krazy Kool Kennedy!!!(BY:Hannah/Chelsea&Yasmin),"Barbie's name has been changed to Kennedy! My Scene Fab Faces Kennedy has beautiful blonde hair and a really cute pink dress(could she get any more innocent looking?). No one's going to say that this doll is too revealing. The second outfit is a large tank with a stylish necklace, shimmery pink capris, and fabulous boots. I wish those boots were real! The acessories are really flattering. I really want this doll!"
5,Barbie's New Name,"I have been searching the stores everywhere for this doll! I have Chelsea and Nolee and now need Barbie and Madison. They changed Barbie's name to Kennedy to match the My Scene ""naming theme."" All of the My Scene characters are named for places/streets in New York! Use Wikepeda to find out more. Madison is named for Madison Avenue, Byrant for Byrant Park, Hudson and River for the Hudson River, etc.Update: I just got this doll, and she's great! The only problem is that her boots for the second outift are a little too high for the pink capris. Other than that, she's great."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING!!!,"This competion between My Scene and Bratz is getting out of hand. Mattel has gotten so desperate that it has decided to come out with these scary dolls. You push one of the 5-6 buttons on the dolls back and she changes her facial expressions. The smiley face button to make the doll smile makes the doll look like a Cabbage Patch doll (no offense). In this day and age of technology, Mattel couldn't have come up with a better way for the dolls to make facial expressions? I have an idea! For the next My Scene Fab Face Doll, make her stick out her tongue so she can give Mattel a raspberry! Holllaaaaa!"
5,Best Toy Monkey Ever!!!!!,"The Wild Republic Itsy Bitsy Chimp 5"" is the best and most fun soft toy I've ever had. ""She""' is so cute and with that big smile on her face, she's always happy! Because she's quite small she's easy to bring anywhere - just hide her in your purse and no one will ever know you've brought a monkey to the party!There is only one drawback - due to the unreliable manufacturing process, not all chimps turn out looking exactly the same. (Similar, but not exactly the same.) The one I bought does look very similar to the one in the photo, which is great because that's the cutest version, I think. It was a bit of a gamble.But, all in all, I am extremely happy with this chimp!!"
4,paradigm shift,"Following up from Libeskind's previous monograph, radix matrix, ""The Space of Encounter"" read brilliantly into the life of this master architect. However whilst the former read as an extrusion into his work, ""Space"" intelligently delves into the writing that aided in the creation of such experience like the Jewish Museum in Berlin. With additional writing by the likes of Kipnis and Vidler it makes this book a must read for anyone interested in the theory and manifestation architectural of ideas. Though the pictures are few, the articulation of the writing weaves fantastical imagery lending to very technique used by Libeskind in his drawings. The book is convenient, as well - fitting nicely in the hand or satchel, making it the ideal companion both in size and in content. Libekind's ""Space of Encounter"" is easily the ""S, M, L, XL"" of the new era."
4,Architectural Merit,The above critic has a deep seeded grudge against Libeskind and his work and has obviously not visited Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin. The museum offers some of the most dynamic and moving spaces in the contemporary architectural scene.
5,A new taste of Rock and R&B with a twist of Latin Ingenuity,"This album is hot from the beginning to the end. The producers did a great job of blending Amaury's strong, but smooth melodic voice to the background music which has a new hip edge to it but still has that classic sound that will keep listeners of the CD in tuned. This is one of the greats in terms of expressing amor. Even if you don't understand Espanol you can feel the message Amaury is trying to come across when singing on this CD. If you don't have this CD it is a must buy. Trust me it will be one of those CDs' in your collection that will be played often. No dust allowed here."
5,A surprise,"Yes, it was a surprice, to listen this cd casually in Spain at a friend's house.Fine arrangements, good musicians, mixing different style.My trak is ""Hace tiempo"" a salsa/funky full of energy, you cannot keep stopped your hands, they will follow the rithm...Enjoy!"
5,Unbelievable approach to drawing fashion ...that works!,"After being a former student of Mr. D'Ortenzio, this book validates Mr. D's (as he is like to call) techniques and approach in the most helpful manner. Learning the art of ""fashion sketching"" through Mr. D, has allowed me to elevate my style and approach of my own work as a designer. This book is a must for the working professional as well as the novice student.Thank you....Fern Rose Mitchell."
1,Natalie Deserves Better,"Very disappointing. Lambert presents Natalie as a narcissistic, suicidal sex addict, drug addict, out of control alcoholic. How did she ever manage to make a movie?This disconnected, chaotic account of many less than interesting moments in Natalie's life lacks authenticity. There's too much wild guessing, not enough flow, no sense of the ""real"" Natalie and what made her tick.On page 337, at the very end of the book, long after reading about her career, her family and her death, Lambert suddenly jumps back to details about her roles in West Side Story, Gypsy and her other films yet again. What happened to the ""creative editor"" he mentions in his acknowledgements?To add to the general confusion, a costume designer named Donfeld is mentioned on almost every page in the book. This bio could, in fact, be retitled ""The Donfeld Story,"" because it certainly isn't the Natalie Wood story!Save your money, this one is a disaster."
1,Hmmm....... interesting,"I found it novel to be able to post a review on a book and subject I've always found interesting (my thanks to you for the opportunity) so I've come back today to ""vist"" my review and in doing so, I read some of the others of course! The suprise was that you've posted two reviews that are identical save the title: one dated January 17th and one January the 18th. Have a look. Even knowing as little of the publishing industry as I do, I'd still call that plugging! Surely one review per person is enough. Had it been me I'd at least changed up the title a bit.regards,mitch wilkins"
1,Natalie Wood,"I waited to read this book and was totally disgusted with it. It was more of a history about her mother (who was no doubt certifiable). Ms Wood dedicated her life, for good or for bad, to the Screen. The least this author could have done was not to write it like someone was standing over his shoulder!"
4,"A nice collection, but there are better ones available","This is a nice collection of some of Elvis' love songs, however there are better ones available. This CD only includes 12 songs and there are more complete collections, with more songs that have been released in recent years. I would recommend that you pass on this collection and pick up ""Love, Elvis"" or the 2 CD set ""The 50 Greatest Love Songs"" instead. You will get more music for your dollar."
2,Not even a average collection,"To start with an Amazon seller sent this to me incorrectly, but I listened to it anyway.The sound quality is just barely okay. I have the Elvis, '50 Greatest Love Songs' and the sound and quality of that set is the best I've ever heard. The engineering and remastering of the sound just sets a very high standard. Beautiful, Elvis was there with me on those takes.This recording just laid there sounding like it wanted to be over with and I seconded that notion.And 12 songs...about 26 minutes of wasted time, couldn't be much shorter?Save the cash, this isn't a keeper."
1,it's the new KMS gel in the blue bottle,"they're selling the new KMS hair gel in the blue bottle. It's not the old one in the white and pink bottle. beware when you order. the new KMS gel has less hold, more shine, and it stinks."
3,Losing listeners with metaphors,"I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this one, I found myself constantly skipping through the tracks getting pissed off, I have been a Basehead fan since Play With Toys (I owned the original, recalled version of that disc) and to come to current times and see DC...it's very depressing, I dont know what state of mind Mike Ivey is in but he needs to awaken. I realize that he is sporting his Christian beliefs now in his music, but he has misplaced the tenacity that made the early (Drunk 'n High) Basehead discs cult classics. Maybe he should try mixing the Blues with Hip-Hop (ala Chris Thomas King and just about any of the younger Fat Possum artists) on future efforts, but this Christian-Hop thing isn't workin'.I gave it 3 stars only because Mike Ivey has so much promise...it's okay for him to believe like he does now, but it was the original Basehead sound that put Mr. Ivey on the map."
3,"It's okay, but I'm not that impressed","It seems like the makers of this movie just wanted to outdo ""The Usual Suspects"", ""The Last Seduction"", and all of those other movies with INTELLIGENT plot twists. The result was a watchable(nice package, Kev!), but silly-as-hell flick that took itself too seriously. It was a nice touch to put Bill Murray in it as a lawyer, and Neve and Denice were great in their bad girl roles. It was just the ridiculous ending and the overuse of ""guy pleasing"" scenes that wore ""Wild Things"" thin. Did that sponteneous threesome scene really needed to be there?"
2,A disturbing slab of lower class sleaze,"Although not as raunchy as Remains of the Day nor as lurid as Shadowlands, this film still scrapes the bottom of the barrel of American prurience in a foul-minded attempt to tweak the noses of right-thinking people in nubby sweaters who only rent films from Miramax and barely know such films as this exist. The effects on our society of exposing the feeble-minded lower orders to their fantasies made real upon the screen can only be imagined with a delicate frisson of horror. Thank God there are still many more unfilmed Edith Wharton novels left to counteract this wave of mental slime."
4,"Good, but...","Wild Thing is an excellent film. Easy as that. But it does have a few flaws (hence the four stars). In the last half an hour you get smacked in the face with more twists and turns than a bowl of noodles, which will make some shreek with delight. John McNaughton has tried to be cleverer than he, his film, and (dare I say it) the majority of his audience actually is. He also makes the text book error of forgetting to give the audience someone to relate to. Okay, so the film isn't really a teen-slasher like Scream or H20, but in another way, it is as well! What we end up with is a thinking teen's-slasher, you know for the teenagers who take Alegebra and read Edgar Alan Poe instead of Irvine Welsh. Oh yea, and teenagers who are over 18! It's very pacey and full of throw away lines to die for and most of you will love this, and fair play to you if you do. But I couldn't help thinking something was missing (and it wasn't anyones, how shall I put this, assets)."
1,Bad!,"I wish I had known a lot of the scenes and some of the story was cut out on the unrated version, I would NOT have purchased this NOR do I recommend it. However the only thing I could find on DVD was the unrated version. I originally owned the original R rated but no one seems to have it except on Amazon on on line viewing. I don't want that. I loaned my original out to someone and it was never returned. Amazon Please get or record it on DVD and I will buy the R rated."
5,wouuw......,"This video, is the gratest, it is so cool. Everytime you think you got it all figgered out, you dont. Please see it, for you owne good."
4,Nothing Is Like It Seems,The way in which Wild Things is put together is far too rare among Hollywood films! The only thing that's sure is that nothing is sure. Nobody is who they appear to be. Everyone betrays everyone. In other words: Excitement right from the very first second till after the credits of Wild Things. A high class thriller!
4,"Sex and Steam in South Florida, Served with Twists","Wild Things, a tawdry tale set in South Florida, is a story with more twists than corkscrew pasta, and is over-the-top good. Matt Dillon stars as guidance counselor Sam Lombardo of a public school in the town of Blue Bay, and is accused of rape by the luscious daughter (Denise Richards) of one of the wealthiest woman in town (Theresa Russell - It's incredible casting, because the mother and daughter look so alike.) Of course, Sam is a former paramour of the mother. From there, things begin to go all over the place: sex, lies, murder, double-crossing, and more. Director John McNaughton really keeps the story tight, and the audience sliding from one surprise to the next. This is sort of Dynasty crossed with Melrose Place for the high school set."
4,"Two's a Company, THree's a Crowd . Sex Crimes 101 .","Film Noir at it's Best. Lies, Betrayal, Deception, Sexual Eroticism. All through the movie You dont know who to cheer for, THe Cop, The Dirty Teacher, The Trailer Trash Chic, The Funny Lawyer, THe School Tramp, The Tramp's MOther, THe Cop's Partner, The Tramp's Mother Cuban LOver. You dont know who is who and what is up or down. ONe big Dirty Camp of a Movie..to describe it with only one word it would be....... YUMMY!"
4,"Extremely sexy, but mildly entertaining.","A school teacher is accused of rape. After being found innocent, he rakes in a fortune in damages. Turns out that his accuser was in league with him to extort her mother for a ton of money. A detective, and a reckless, rebel are also on their heels, and may bring their plot to light.This movie has a pretty good cast, and story. It's a great movie to watch once. I think that the sex was focused on too much. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Denise Richards getting it on in this movie, but that theme can only carry a movie so far. I think that Bill Murray and Kevin Bacon saved this movie from total failure with their performances. I recommend renting this film, I think deciding to buy it is totally up to the individual."
4,Good but kinda bad acting sometimes,This movie was actually really good I'm not gonna get into the description but into the DVD the unrated version doesn't really make much of a difference. The one thing I don't like about this movie is the acting Dennis Richards is in ways a bad actress especially in this movie other than that it's great
4,Poor guy,This movie came on time and it worked great in my player. It was a very interesting movie. I would recomend it to other buyers.
4,should'nt be missed,"I thought this movie was great, the story twisting kept you thinking and wondering. You would'nt think that what they showed was going to happen. Great acting by neve cambell. It was a well written movie and i recommend it to anyone to watch."
3,"Good movie, deleted scenes pointless, commentary decent","If what you are buying this for is to see more of Denise Richards or Neve Campbell in the deleted scenes, don't. Otherwise if you liked the movie just buy it."
4,A WONDERFUL GUILTY PLEASURE!,"I'm a 47 year old accountant. I should not have like this movie. But I did. I rate it 4 out of 5.I love suspense/thriller/ mysteries...especially if they have plot twists. Some erotic scenes don't hurt either. And I can enjoy and appreciate a little camp now and then. This guilty pleasure has it all.I think ""Wild Things"" was done in a serious manner, but meant to be taken as tongue-in-cheek. It's not high brow stuff. Just a fun romp.Besides Matt Damon, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Murrary are fun to watch.Shhhhh....don't tell anyone I liked this movie.Namaste'"
2,Way too many twists.,"The ultra- confusing storyline put me out of comisssion long before the end came around. And even when the end does come around, the film is STILL explaining its countless sub-plots. Director John McNaughton also directed the impeccable ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer""; watch that instead."
4,Expect the Unexpected!,"Unlike many customers who reviewed this movie, I did not rent it because of the 3-some scene. I didn't know a thing about this movie when I rented it. I have to say this movie was just awesome. I think the effect was really powerful on me cuz I had no expectations at all. Once the plot started twisting, it never stopped. Everytime I thought I knew what was going on, I would find out just how wrong I was. The basic rule of thumb with this movie is this, when you think the story can't possibily twist again, it will twist one more time! Its a must see movie! Great story and awesome performences by the actors. A nice change for Neve Campbell might I add! If you haven't see it, please do, you won't regret it!"
4,"Surprise, Surprise","Two Surprises here.Surprise number 1.This movie is MUCH better than I expected. Matt Dillon as a school teacher, can I stand the strain?Surprise number 2This film is as close to Film Noir as any I have seen in the past few years.Filled to the brim with ""Eye Candy"" You will get to see as much of Neve Cambell and Denise Richards as a mans heart can stand.Kevin Bacon is a very convincing cop.Bill Murray does a workmanlike job as a sleazy lawyer (is there any other kind?)If You like ""Good Lookin' Women"" and a dozen plot twists per hour, then SEE THIS FILM!"
2,"NOTHING TO SAVE, EXCEPT THE CROCODILES !","To say that "" Wild things "" is a bad movie isn't enough. Why a movie with such good actors can be that bad ; that's the question to ask! First the plot : now, at least, we know that a movie mixing "" Vertigo "" , "" And then, they were none "" and "" Everglades : an hostile world "" (produced by Florida Tourist Office) CAN'T work. Then, I believe it's one of the first time in Movie history that a film is conceived as a crossed-word puzzle. With the solution in the same film (at the last page. No sorry ! during the final credits, I mean) ! The public would have deserved a "" Wild Things"" Part 2. That's part of elementary respect. Respect of the audience is a real forgotten concept in Hollywood nowadays. OK I'm too virulent. I loved the crocodiles. A DVD to destroy."
2,What the ?,"Every review I have read of this movie has been so positive I have to wonder whether we're all talking about the same film. I found the ""twists"" totally predictable and quintessentially Hollywood. There's so many people screwing each other over it throws all pretense of realism out the window. You start to become so suspicious of all the characters and expect the worst that it all becomes plainly obvious. The whole way through the film I sat there with a friend predicting what would happen next, and I was always right. The threesome scene and lesbian scene would definitely turn some guys on but since I'm a girl I wasn't too enthralled. The acting was okay but it wasn't enough. It's possible I might have appreciated the film a bit more if I hadn't had such high expectations of it. Another typical Hollywood export."
2,A chilly remake is predictable and tame,"Everything that's attempted in this imitation film has been done before. If you really want this movie, or what this movie tries to be, then buy Body Heat. Kathleen Turner makes the teeny tramps of this supposed ""hot drama"" look like Barbie Dolls who've been drug through the mud.It's popular to twist plots. But when you can see the new turn coming fifteen minutes in advance, then the twists and turns are nothing but annoying."
5,Wild Things is HOT and keeps you on your toes.,"This is a male point of view. If your a guy, your going to love it for the sexy scenes (namely Denise Richards! Denise Richards! Denise Richards!) and the plot that keeps you guessing right into the final credits. Women who I went with to see it did enjoy it very much but my buddies liked it even more. For some reason this is one of my favorites of all time. I guess because the movie went into areas most don't normally go......................"
3,"Good plot twists, but nothing much besides that","For those that like to actively engage the movie and figure out the bad guys and good guys before they are revealed, this movie is for you. This film features some great plot twists towards the end of the movie.Unfortunately, that is the only good thing I can say about this movie. The acting by the familiar ""teen"" faces, directing, soundtrack, etc. are mediocre.And I did not find the ""sex scenes"" that erotic or engaging."
3,"Diverting, brainless thriller","Yes, it's trash, but it's good trash-- and sometimes that's what a guy wants. You got your nudity, your faux lesbian scenes, your bloody mayhem, your shock-the-sailors profanity. My only complaints is thta they put some important plot points in the credits; even Soccby Doo cartoons planned our their climaxes better. But invite your friends, break out the beer and nachos, and team this up with ""Showgirls"" (unrated version) for a Bargain Bin Film Festival."
3,Kevin Bacon's Full Body Shot,"Okay, it's not Body Heat or Blood Simple, but those two movies are rated in the top twenty suspense, sex, and murder films ever made. Let's just say that Wild Things delivers a very sexy mystery with thrills and chills. If great looking young chicks and overheated swamp fevers are your thing, then you're going to love Neve Campbell and Denise Richards. And don't miss the Kevin Bacon full body shot. Is Matt Dillion one of film's handsomest men? Err, ahh, I'm straight, but anyhow, Bill Murray again steals part of a movie without trying. Fun film, but don't watch with snotty Hitchcock snobs."
5,Guilty Pleasure,"Yes, this movie is verrry entertaining. (more twists than a pretzel factory.) However, it's extremely obvious that 99% of this movie is based on some guy's fantasies. i.e.: Denise Richards beating up Neve Campbell, then parting her hair and asking, ""You are scared, aren't you?"" while following a passionate girl-on-girl kissfest; 2 girls washing a jeep getting soaking wet; threesome between 2 girls & Matt Dillon; the list goes on and on. But hey, regardless of all of that, it's very intriguing. It's a guilty pleasure; you can't help but enjoy it. You won't be able to tell who's screwing who until the very end. Bottom Line: This movie is enjoyable, whether you're a guy or a girl."
4,Better than expected,I never would have thought that this movie had scenes that could show off the power of 1080 but i was sure wrong. Any of you who remember the pool scene will know that just that in hd was well worth it. Along with all the other veiws of florida that are in the movie.well worth the money
5,Best movie ever!,This is such a fantastic movie. I watch it all the time. Love all the twists in it. Must watch!
3,Implausible But Entertaining as Hell,The plot really twists and turns and pushes the envelope a bit on believablity but overall the movie is pretty darn entertaining from a number of perspectives.The hot girls pursuing their teacher angle makes it feel like a soft-porn movie at times but Matt Dillon and Kevin Bacon are both very good in their respective roles. Bill Murray has a minor role as a sleazy attorney and he's fabulous in every scene he's in.The settings in South Florida are beautifully filmed and the opening credits sequence with aerial views of Miami underscored by some really steamy music is really well done.Not a classic by any measure but it's not a bad couple of hours entertainment either.
3,Could be wilder,"Two high school girls accuse their guidance councelor of rape and take him to court. But as it turns out, the girls and the councelor are plotting to get Richard's inheritence so they can runaway to a tropical island together. The story proceeds to take many other turns and twists. Very good suspense/sex/drama/horror blend with great characters and plot but mixes far too many generational ingredients like music and dialogue. The final product could be a lot better if it strayed a little further from the usual teeny bopper garbage."
4,Left me Breathless!,"'Wild Things' is a tale of betrayl, sex, murder and alcohol. It sure left me breathless and impressed!Denise Richards stars as Kelly Van Ryan, a young teenager who offers to wash her guidance counsellor Sam Lombardo's (Matt Dillion) car one day. The next poor Kelly ends up in tears and accuses Sam of rape. That is where the madness begins!Wild Things is a great thriller that I recommend you see!"
3,Neve Campbell should act more she's terrific,"Actually, the whole cast worked well together. Humid Florida wealthy trampy mom ignores daughter she in turn is manipulated by sleazy teacher, girl from the wrong side of the tracks is in on the con. This movie reminded me of ""Palmetto"" a little seen movie with Woody Harrilson and Elizabeth Shue. It wasen't a big hit but it was the same type of con game being played on some slippery characters. Enjoy!"
3,its getting wild in the swamp,"good story with Richards confessing that Dillon did something to her and hes her teacher. it turns out that Dillon, Richards and Neve Campbell are working together. Bacon and his partner investigate more into the story. then theres death, twists and turns and a good cast line up. Bill Murray is hilarious and Richards shows her bazoombas(which is highlight, hee hee). the twist in the end when Bacon also is in it and then hell breaks loose is great too but did we have to see Bacon's how do you do down there"
1,Trashy and awkward sexual thriller,Trashy and awkward attempt at a sexual thriller with cardboard cut-out characters that you could care less about. Neve deserves better. Kevin's shower scene isn't too bad (full frontal with nothing to be ashamed of). But overall...a waste of time.
2,1/2 Good Actors 1/2 Bad Actresses,"Neve Campbell and Denise Richards ""Acting""...that's laughable. Yet Kevin Bacon's uncompromisable performance (akin to his 1,000's of other roles) is in line with the great acting we've come to expect from him. The thing is, he plays ""sleazy"" so well, its hard to expect anything else from him. Personally, Dillon doing ""Singles"" is the one saving grace for him that I have, he also does have some other memorable roles, but the fact that he most likely did sleep with his co-stars off screen, as well as on, leads me to believe he had alterior motives in choosing this script. I can't help but feeling like a little highschooler trying to witness some of the ""action"" in adult movies while watching this film. The script seems to be derived from a high schooler after all. I'm guessing this was filmed in a couple of weeks, in between the actors other projects."
2,Could have been...,"After the movie ends, you would know that this movie could have been GREAT! Could have if the story was told in another way... If the same scenes where rearranged, it might have been acceptable!What makes this movie so bad, is that for almost two hours the movie tells you nothing but lies! And after the movie ends (yes and credits start), then the truth is told! Not a twist, not a surprise but totally new revealing scenes of a different story. This is a very bad way to make a movie..."
5,Scandalous fun,"Beauty is the word but let us tease you anyways. Teacher in big trouble even though in todays world it is usually a young female teacher but anyways you have a movie with Kevin Bacon and Neve Campbell in it so what more could you ask for? Oh well the plot is so so it is just a scamming script set under a simmering sun that is sinful and lovely. Best watched when eating pumpkin pie topped off with whipped cream, but hold the pickles."
3,Surprisingly watchable flick,"when you consider the cast and limited talent level (c'mon; let's be real), but the storyline manages to hook you and hold you, because you just have to know what the hell's going to happen next. Yeah, there's some bad acting and scenery-chewing, but it's OK; it's never enough to sink anything, and there's some decent eye candy as well. Bill Murray and Theresa Russel are unexpectedly effective (especially Murray), Wagner is horrible, and Daphne is, no question at all, just as sexy as the two stars. Ultimately, though, it kind of had one twist too many, and that's why I couldn't give it 4 stars. Worth seeing, for sure."
3,UNRATED?,I dont really see what the difference is between the unrated and r rated version of this dvd. Why do they always release unrated dvd versions years later the originally released?
4,Far more fun than it should be,"There's really little point in summarizing the plot of this absurdity. It's equally unnecessary to analyze the writing, the acting, or anything else in the way of specifics, since they're all pretty much irrelevant. What this film is about is mood. And somehow, rising from its cast of B-movie and B-TV blanks (you know who you are), uneasily grown-up demi-stars, and slumming greats (okay, just one of those in Bill Murray, who looks like he's embarassed to be having this good a time), and its Miami-Vice out-take footage, there's a sweet noir sweat which hits early and refuses to go away. It may not be exactly brilliant, but it's brilliantly entertaining. Perhaps unintentionally (although isn't it pretty to think that it was purposeful?), the makers of this movie have managed to create something which transcends not just itself, bt also a whole lot of things trying to pass themselves off as art."
4,Lots of fun!,"I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining this movie was. Nice ensemble cast, and its clever plot always kept me guessing. Something different here, but film's dark core may turn off some."
3,"A movie filled with suspense, twists, and sex.","The movie was a suprising pleasure to watch. The continous twists and turns kept my interest alive while wanting to call it off as another boring action-suspense movie. Though sewn together in a very mechanic and ""Hollywood"" fashion, the film still deserves the open-mindedness of the tasteful and the curious. Denise Richards and Neve Campbell play roles which are antithetical of each other; Denise playing the sexy and popular high school girl, and Neve Campbell's role as the backwoods girl who smokes joints and reads existential literature, provide a diverse realm of characters which include Matt Damon and Kevin Bacon in their starring roles. The suprises in the movie are its vivid sexual content and the endless twists in the plot of ""who dun it? and the question ""Who is the Hero or Heroine?"" A movie worth watching."
4,So many plot twists that it will turn you into a cork screw!,"This movie is the kind that you start watching and don't know whether or not you will loose interest at first, then it just keeps you hanging in there until you are hooked. There are several scenes that would not make it suitable for younger or prudish audiences. Some action moments but mostly suspense and tons of plot shifts. A movie that definitely keeps you in the dark until the very end. There is no way that you will be saying, ""Oh, I know how this will end.""."
4,"Fun, funny, plot twists, babes, hunks -- isn't that enough?","I enjoyed this film more than 90 percent of the films I've seen, and I've seen a lot of films: classics, special effects showcases, French new wave, Hong Kong, you name it. And it stands up to repeated watching.The DVD gives you a choice of widescreen or tv-like aspect ration, French or English speech, and French or English subtitles. Improve your French! The DVD also offers some extra scenes (not very interesting) and a director's commentary (interesting in parts, if you're interested in such things as how various ""night"" scenes were lit."
3,"Sexy, thrilling but nothing special","I have a little hard on the rating. All in all it is a pretty good movie, if you are looking for a thrill, mix in some raunchy sex scenes, add the most beautiful girl on film, then get her to take her clothes off and make out with Nev Campbell and you are onto a good thing. Sure it is not deep but who the hell said we want deep, we might just want entertainment and that it delivers.All in all it should give you a good night in, especially if you are watching it with your partner. Enjoy"
4,"Great, if you're into this kind of movie...","If you're reading this, you're probably aware this movie definitelly isn't a 'classic', and that it contains many explicit sex scenes. If you don't mind that, and are willing to take it as it is (a sexy thriller) - you're in for a real treat. The plot is so full of twists, once you think you understand everything - you'll discover a new angle that would make you look at things in a totally different way."
4,Unrated edition?,"First, the pros: excellent picture quality/sound, and a great film. Now the cons: no full screen option(like on the 'R' rated version)no extras(like on the 'R' rated version)no commentary. All you get is a talent file extra. And as for the 'unrated' labeling, I didn't see but a few scenes at the end of the film during the credits and some new dialogue. Certainly not the hype as listed on the keep case. In my opinion, the 'R' rated version is a better disc, but if you really liked this movie, you should have it for the improved crystal-clear picture quality."
3,"It has its moments, many of them confusing as heck...","Well, this is one of them there movies with so many bloody twists you just KNOW that the director is laughing at you every second of the way. I watched this and had a hard time following parts of it, and to be honest some of the end-title 'revalations' were tacked on as far's I am concerned. The best parts of this movie involve Theresa Russell, both on a balcony in a bikinia and on a deckhand in bed. She is not used enough as far as I am concerned. If you like, say, Kevin Bacon or the gal with the eyebrows from Starship Troopers, you will like this movie. Myself I thought it needed a more coherant screen play and more of madame Russell, but then, that is just me I suppose..."
3,Good songs from a great Tunesmith,"With such a prolific output then not everything produced is a gem and so this is the case with ""Happy Hour"". Clive's written, played and produced all the compositions and as he feely admits they started out as a demo. That sparse accompaniment is too thin at times despite his expert guitar playing and the odd church bell! Well worth the investment but not my favourite."
5,It's a wonderful read.,"If you love Anne of Greengables and the rest of LM Montgomery's book, you'll love this one too. It's a great book for when you're curled up in your bed and it's cold out. Get it."
4,Lovely Set of Short Stories,"This is a set of short stories all set along the coast of Prince Edward Island, written with the usual charm of Montgomery's works. Most of the stories are written for older audiences -- there are tales of love lost and love found, family relationships, friendship, and the lure of the sea. These are appropriate for all readers with one caveat -- the last story, ""A House Divided Against Itself"" uses some language (including the ""N"" word) that was common when the story was published in 1930, but would be considered inappropriate by today's standards. Highly recommended for fans of Anne of Green Gables, or readers who enjoy stories of the sea with romantic, descriptive prose."
2,Unoriginal esoterica,"Karma is a mixture of Enigma, Deep Forest, Dead Can Dance, Peter Gabriel's Passion, with a little bit of the Cocteau Twins on it. It's is not bad, but the rhythm patterns sound dated. ""Enchanted"", the opener, and ""Wisdom"", are the only tracks worth the price of this CD."
5,Perfect album,"This greatest hits,the music is ethereal and is great when you sitting in a quiet place and listening, I like it :)"
5,"Yes, This Is One Of The Greatest Albums Ever Made","I'm not joking. Delerium's ""Karma"" was an accident for me. I bought the wrong album back in 1997 at a Virgin Megastore thinking it was someone else. I popped the CD into my CD player and never turned back. What a beautiful album. Every track takes you somewhere. The lush female vocals and musical arrangements are extrodinary. Every song is a highlight, including ""Silence"" with guest singer Sarah McLachlan. There are a few instrumentals, and they are just as good as the vocalized songs.I have to be up front with you. This album is not filled with standard pop fare. It has pop elements, but is designed more like a new ""world"" age album. It has chants/ethnic intruments/trip hop dance grooves and electronica elements. Enigma is the closest thing I can relate Delerium to, but they do sound different from one anorher. ""Karma"" is the album to get. ""Semantic Spaces"" and ""Poem"" are okay, but ""Karma"" is the best."
4,An awesome CD!,"I purchased this album based on the fact that Sarah McLachlan contributed her heavenly voice to the track ""Silence"", but I actually ended up loving the entire album. I'm not much for this kind of music, but I can't resist how beautiful these songs are. Aside from ""Silence"", favorites include ""Duende"" (which features Sarah's back-up singer, Camille Henderson) and ""Remembrance"". Even if you're not into this type of music, give ""Karma"" a try. I'm glad I did!"
5,Incredible,"This album is incredible. It's the best CD I own. The songs are exquisite, the lyrics are beautiful, and it's just as good at background noise as it is at a dance club. It's great."
5,"Unbelievable,Chilling and Beautiful",I heard this music at a friends and was totally mezmorized by this sound that makes you want to dance and stay still at the same time just to let the beats transform you to another plane. Simply wonderful makes enigma look weak (very weak)Run to the store to purchase and tell your friends!!!!
5,First serious divergence.,"For those of you unfamiliar with Delerium, they were started as a side project to experiment with music, and wound up becoming what they are today. Their early albums were entirely instrumental, a sort of blend of techno, synth, and house music. Unlike much of the music in the genre, it wasn't boring, nor was every ""song"" really the same thing done with another synth filter.This album represents their first major shift over from pure ""instrumental"" to instrumental + vocal. Their previous album, Semantic Spaces, featured some vocals, but not nearly in this quantity.Karma has vocals in almost every song, usually done in a very haunting way. The sound of this album is unique, in the actual sense of the word. Slow lead in, slow fade out, with different textures all throughout the middle. No fan of chill-out music should be without this album."
5,If I only could take only one album........,"If I could take only one album into my next reincarnation, this would be it."
4,Awesome,"The first time I heard this CD I was in complete awe. Absolutely wonderful music. The album starts quite slow and melodic (Duende), turns very emotional (Silence) towards the middle, and then slows back down again before the end. If you want some great background music that isn't too cluttered, yet is very deep, this CD is as good as you can get. If you looking for a more light listening experience, look elseware."
3,It is a good CD.,The samples are a little too much but it is a solid cross between Dead Can Dance and Enigma.
4,Instant Karma,This music is ethereal and is great for sitting in a room lit by candles with incense burning. I had never hear of Delerium and I'm going to check out some of their other CDs.
2,Good but they really should make their own music,"I am still counting the number of great music creators that this 'artist' has 'borrowed' from; Enigma, Deep Forest, Dead Can Dance, Peter Gabriel, Archetribe, etc...Enchanted is a [spinoff] of an Enigma songTwilight is a [spinff] of a Deep forest songForgotten worlds is a [spinoff] of a great Dead Can Dance songLamentation and Remembrance are [spinoffs] of one of the greatest soundtracks (cd's for that matter) ever created, Passion by Peter Gabriel, although anything Gabriel touches is good...Now in closing this is not a bad CD but I really get angry when people try to sell music that is just a copy of someone else's great creation. For that I boycott Delerium, now that I unfortunately own most of their CD's."
5,An Otherworldy Album,"I first heard about this Canadian band when a local Seattle radio station played a track of the CD with Sarah MacLachlan on lead vocals. After I heard that song (""Silence""), I knew I had to get the CD. When I got it, I wasn't dissapointed. I still play it often, even a couple of years later, and it has become one of my favorite CDs. Favorite tracks are the single, ""Euphoria (Firefly)"" and the first track, ""Enchanted.""The band does sound similar to Enigma, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially if you like Enigma! I would say it's a must have for people who like trance music with lots of imagination, both in the lyrics and melody. This is very sexy music.So, yes, you should probably buy it. But you can always preview a couple of the tracks on this site just to make sure."
2,Nothing new... really,"Although Karma I feel could be taken a little more seriously than it's preceeder Semantic Spaces, it still lacked severly in originality. The over-sampling of other artists is simpley ridiculous and once you realize that most of the drum loops and much of the instrumentations are hardly their own, you gradualy begin to realize how phoney and trendy this album really is! Just to name a few, you've got samples directly lifted from Peter Gabrial, Tori Amos, Enigma (yet again), Garbage, Waterbone, and Dead Can Dance (DCD being the only band whom sample credits were given to), not to mention I reccommend albums by ALL OF THE ABOVE ARTISTS before I would reccommend this ""Sampler of Various Artists"". As for the lyrical and vocal arrangements go ... not bad for the most part but they failed to impress me much either."
4,A chanty sort of techno...,"Now here's an album that sounds like Front Line Assembly meets Gregorian Chant. All of the tunes are very rhythmic and chant-like, but they could have strung all of the tracks together into one. Not a whole lot of variance, but a mello album that's good music."
5,Easily makes my top 10!,"There are very few albums I can sit down and listen to in their entirety, but this is definitely one of them. For all you Sarah McLachlan fans, her track on this disc (4:Silence) is, in my opinion, one of her best performances ever. Other high-points on this album include tracks 3,5,7, and 11."
5,My most played CD of 1997,"If you already know Delerium, let me just say this is my favorite album to date. If you don't, probably the closest comparison would be to Enigma, though I believe Delerium is better. Karma very much continues in the theme of Semantic Spaces. My roommate borrowed Karma and refused to return it, so I bought a second copy...One note: there was a 2 CD limited version of Karma which contains 2 extra tracks...if you can find this version, I recommend it."
4,3 long years!,"Well, after three years the higher ups finally got smart and realized Silence, which features the vocal stylings of Sarah McLachlan. And thank goodness they did. Finally the world can jam the dance floors to this wonderful, euphoric song. And from, world chart action, it looks like the world is doing just that!!!!!!"
1,A Total Rip-off,"No originality, no creativity, confused rhythms, shameless sampling, and a total waste of time and money.Buy a Dead Can Dance, Cocteau Twins, Peter Gabriel, or Brian Eno album."
2,Contains 1 great track...,"This disc contains the original version of 'Silence' by Sara M., other than that...Yawn."
2,Returned the album.,The seller is terrific. I returned this because I didn't like the album. Too dark and goth for my taste.
4,Robe hook,"Item arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Robe hook is as expected, functional and matches the rest of our bathroom fixtures. Very good quality."
4,good quality - not disappointed,Bought three items from this manufacturer and they all worked great and look beautiful inour new shower. I would recommend this product.
2,Failed on first trial,"Bought this to replace a similar size Green Pan since we liked the ceramic non-stick, non-toxic coating on the Green Pan, but wanted a longer lasting pan. I assumed this enamel on steel pan would be a step up, however when I came home from work the pan was sitting on the counter filled with water and the remains of a fried egg with a note from my wife saying ""This pan doesn't work!"" Sure enough, she had followed all the directions about using a little oil, using low to medium heat, etc., but the egg stuck anyway. And stuck so hard that even soaking overnight didn't release it. I scrubbed it out several times, finally resorting to stove top cleaner to remove the egg! Back it went. We're trying a Scanpan next. If that doesn't work, we're going back to the Green Pans. They're reasonably priced and work well even if they don't last forever."
5,great stuff,"This is great stuff...particularly L'ile Helene. Such a great sound mix for a live recording, too."
2,OK Shower head,This purchase was an exact replacement for my existing head which was losing it's finish. Somehow they changed the design and I was getting poor water pressure even with the water saver out. My house has great pressure so this unit had to be returned. Fortunately Amazon was great about handling that for me. I would not recommend this product even at it's $30 price point.
4,Nice showerhead,"Simple to install and compliments the bathroom nicely. The only thing you'll need are a wrench, teflon tape and about five minutes."
5,Eric Martin is now my favorite rock and roll singer!,"I am kicking myself for not knowing who Mr. Big was before buying the Tak Matsumoto Group album and wondering who the singer was. I thought he was a young kid but no, he's a year older than me and been around for the eighties and nineties rock roller coaster. I couldn't afford the one ""Actual Size"" that isn't on MP3 list but I now own all the other studio albums. I am enjoying the great vocals and fun rock songs. Eric Martin is now my favorite rock and roll singer! He just has a great range and power that just electrifies the songs. I hope that ""What If..."" is not the last album for this awesome band!"
3,Lean Into It is THE album to get from Mr. Big,"Having listened to the other two major releases from Mr. Big, this is their best. Lean Into It provides their most popular two tunes (for airplay) in ""To Be With You"" and ""Alive and Kickin'"" which are both very good. For those unfamiliar with this band, three other songs rate high off this album: Green-Tinted Sixties Mind, CDFF-Lucky This Time and Just Take My Heart. Never Say Never is OK and the rest of the album is fair at best.Good guitar from Paul Gilbert and good vocals from Eric Martin make the songs listed worthwhile. Eric sounds a bit like Jeff Keith from Tesla. Just imagine a Tesla-like band with a little less hard edge on the rockers and you get a good feel for Mr. Big."
3,This one will do,"If you have decided to get only one Mr. Big album (which is in fact a good decision since one is enough), this is the one to get.It's decent hard rock typical for the time of its release. Many people seem to think Eric Martin is a great singer, well I don't... I even think he has a tendency to be boring in the long run and after hearing more than one Mr. Big album in a row you might even begin to hate the guy's voice... At least I tend to do!"
5,Desert island take-along,"This would have to top my list of CDs to be stranded with, not even a 4 star song in this 5 star bunch. From the Makita drill intro of Daddy, Brother, Lover, Little Boy to the last falsetto of To Be With You Eric Martin and company delivers. Tight arrangements, impeccable musicianship and the best vocalist to stand in front of a microphone all blend seamlessly into one of the best all time hard rock releases. In Japan Mr Big, with new guitarist Ritchie Kotzen, are one of the biggest acts touring, too bad America let them slip away."
3,Lightweight flies,"Disappointing: I thought this one was not up to Geirach's own standard of idiosyncracy, his way with a ""serious"" fishing topic --and I definitely challenge to the reductionist flyfisher/reviewer who said ""flies are just means to and end"" --so lures and flies are the same? Then why bother.Puck John's books usually light up something -- something that stays with you above and beyond fishing. When you blow away the clever bits here, there's not much news or insight, as here was in Bamboo. If anybody could unravel the sphinx nature of some fly patterns, it woulda been him.But not.PS: I think the legend on the half title page is misattributed, to Wendell Barry 9s9c) = Berry. Anyone else get that?"
3,Pretty good book,I thought that it was a pretty good book. It wasn't what I had expected and do wish that there were more pictures illistrating what the author was talking about. Also the first half of the book was an introduction and history lesson that was long and somewhat boring. The Sakeutiki itself (which was the second half of the book) was interesting.
4,Sakuteiki,"This book has made an enjoyable read, although it is more philosophical than practical. Nevertheless, the book provided insights into meanings and symbolic understandings of plants, rocks, boulders, flagstones, etc. as the;y are used in gardens in Japan. I will cherish this book as I go about creating a small garden atmy desert home in California."
4,Belly Dance: Danse Orientale,So far I like the CD. The music is of good quality and has some personality and energy. There are musical changes so if you were creating a dance routine it would not be boring.
3,"Somewhat dissapointing, but interesting","Primarily, I wish I had read the description more carefully - this paperback runs to 128 pgs. So I was somewhat dissapointed on arrival. I do understand that these tiny-press Euro books cost a lot in the US...AS to the content, it's pretty good. There is a minimum of self-congratulation about how much cooler the system is than more traditional methods, and a fairly close focus on actual practice. The author mixes and matches from cultures freely, now from Africa, now North America. he has managed, nevertheless, to compose a pretty coherent system, based primarily in the symbols that have come to be associated with 'chaos' magic as a school. If you're interested in practical spell-work and magical power, with little regard for conservative occult ethics, this is a good book if you can afford it."
3,Perfect,"Gee,Chaos and sorcery is an excellent book . It scans topics`and supplies detail. Its a good read for any chaos magician."
4,"Beautiful photos, slightly disappointing text","Buy this for the stunning black and white photos generously presented throughout. Many are full-page sized and all are beautifully printed. The text, however, is somewhat disappointing, serving as a rather shallow survey of movies of the early 30's. Historical context is covered well but, for all the pre-code movies that are available on cable these days, this book discusses in depth only the most well known (such as King Kong, It Happened One Night, and Sign of the Cross). Reading this book got me interested in watching pre-code movies, but most of the more interesting films I've seen from that era (Wild Boys of the Road, Safe in Hell, Other Men's Women, Five Star Final) aren't covered here, despite their provocative themes. I'm finding more depth in Thomas Doherty's book Pre-Code Hollywood. But as a coffee-table book of early Hollywood, and perhaps as a mouth-watering introduction to this fascinating era of popular culture, this can't be beat."
5,BEAUTIFUL AND ACCURATE,"This is a beautiful and accurate history of pre-Code, carefully researched and intelligently written. There are two great pre-Code books -- this and Complicated Women by LaSalle. Both are recommended with the highest praise."
4,Entertaining look at a formidable time in film history,"This book offers a great collection of photographs and an insightful look at the early days of Hollywood when religious groups, politicians and self-important studio execs were grappling with Hollywood's role and responsibilities. Many nearly forgotten films are discussed. Like McCarthyism, this issues deserves this look so that we don't forget where society has been. A great book for film buffs."
4,Informative book on pre-code Hollywood,"This book is a very informative book on pre-code Hollywood, excellent written and visual examples."
3,Beautiful book but a disappointment.,"Beautiful photos but not a lot of new information.Meticulously researched? (see previous review) Maybe, but the photo of Alice Faye is not by George Hurrell. It is by Max Munn Autrey.If something I am familiar with is incorrect, chances are there are other errors regarding things that I am unfamiliar with."
3,Text also in soft-focus,"While I can't understand the nit-picking objections of some previous reviewers, the text here does seem subsumed to the illustrations and to what end. Understanding the context of pre-Code Hollywood is not something that requires pictures. Viera's overview is easy enough to digest but why not something a little deeper, was there neither world enough nor time?"
3,Sleepy Smooth Jazz,"This is just another collection of very boring ""smooth jazz"" music. The only reason I gave it three stars is because of ""So Not So"", which features Randy Brecker on trumpet. This is probably how Miles Davis would do ""Blue In Green"" if he were alive today, muted trumpet and all."
3,Geezer meets Martin.,"It rocks. The only problem- the musical arrangements aren't spectacular nor are any of the lyrics particularly memorable.There's no real outstanding track on the disc (though 'Hand that rocks the cradle' is a solid single). Whereas there are too many average efforts like 'Psychophobia', 'Back to Eden', and 'Cardinal Sin'.Again.. none of these are ""bad"" tunes.. just not up to Sabbath's exceptionally high standards."
2,the worst sabbath cd of the tony martin years,"first of all,i'm a huge fan of black sabbath's years with tony martin as vocalist.but this album i hate to say isn't that good.it don't even come close to sabbath's other albums with martin such as headless cross or the eternal idol.but cross purposes do have some highlights ,the three biggest highlights on cross purposes are i witness,the hand that rocks the cradle and evil eye.these three songs are fantastic ,some of the best songs tony martin recorded with sabbath.after these three tracks the only two really good songs left on this cd is psychophobia and virtual death.the five other songs are not that good.this album is a bit of a disappointment.only recommended for really die hard fans of sabbath."
3,"Ah, the lost years of Black Sabbath.","Well, it's ok, but if Ozzy was on this album, I don't think these songs would've been made. What really suprised me was the many positive reviews. This album's ok, but the singer is just not all that great. His best songs are ""Cross of Thorns"" and ""Cardinal Sin."" Tony plays solos like that. He's really evolved since Sabotage. This is good, but it's not all that great. Get Paranoid for true Sabbath."
3,3.5 stars,The usual Black Sabbath with Tony Martin. Heavy music but with some very good ballads. In fact the ballads are the really good tracks in this album. Cross of thorns + The hand that rocks the cradle. The other songs are average and below average
2,Not a very good video,"I do not like this video because the lead singer is Tony Martin. He trys to sound like Ozzy, but does a terrible job."
3,Mild Abrasion!!,"This studio effort from Sab feat Tony Martin on vocals is not the greatest Sab album ever, but just plain decent. Geezer's signiture pounding bass can be heard on tracks Virtual Death and Evil eye. Iommi as always delivers the goods, bringing us his patient riffs which saves this album. Dying For Love was a good ballad by the band. Martin's vocals do sound Dioish at times, Martin is not one of my favorite Sab vocalists but he devolps a more destinct sound on this album than on past albums. Martin's vocals on past albums, such as The Eternal Idol, Headless Cross, and Tyr sound like a 2nd rate version of Dio. This album in my opinion is far better than the almost forgotten Forbidden."
4,A good start bound to get better.,"At first, this book was hard to get into because the beginning isn't the best catcher. Some of the things we like and use are renamed something else to reflect the idea that they live in a different world.Some of the ideas are taken directly out of fantasy type worlds, but it's somewhat more based on science fiction.The characters each have their own charisma and dislikes, and behaviors completely their own. One thing you won't do is confuse characters in this book, which is sometimes a problem with fantasies.Aaaanyway..The plot as you get deeper into it is deep and it'll hold onto you. You'll find yourself in the midst of the problems encountered by the main character, and you definitely will regret when this book comes to an end.I'm just headed out to get the second.. I can't wait to find what happens next!From kisses snuck between antagonistic characters, and spiteful words flung at friends, this isn't something you'll put down."
2,Too much too soon.,"I didn't even finish this book, In the first three chapeters I had more than 20 characters for follow and remember. Just too many for my tiny brain to keep straight. I get the story line I just don't know who the players are. This book was not an enjoyable read!"
3,Good Enterntainment,"This is a good piece of fantasy. It has a capturing story, well develped characters and good and evil fighting. It is not however a really outstanding story.It is ideal to fill the gap between bestsellers."
1,"depressing read, yuch characters","When I read I book the 1 thing I ask for is at least 1 character that I can like. All of these characters were obsessed with power and just plain nasty. the plot does not really go anywhere, except down hill, and you end the book with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of chocolate can get rid of.hated it enough to write this review!"
3,A so so read.,"This book was recommended to me by Amazon so I decided to take a look. Now I almost wish I hadn't bothered.There is nothing fantasy like with this so called fantasy book except the fact that it happens in a world that seems medieval. Period. No magic. No enchanted creatures. Nothing at all. I don't think it should be called fantasy at all. I did see one reference to it being a cross between sci-fi and fantasy and perhaps it belongs there.I often found the book boring and it is never exciting or thrilling. It mostly just trudges along, doggedly.The characters are well fledged out though and very believable. And there is no doubt that this author can write so therefore the 3 stars, which should really be 2,5.As I usually have to follow a story I've started I might buy the sequels. Then again, I might not.I don't recommend these books to anyone looking for fantasy."
4,Jennifer Fallon,"Very good author. I will read all of her books. I am already through the second book and working on the 3rd of this trilogy. It started a little slow, but it is riveting how in depth the plot has become as I've moved into the second and third book. Definitely recommend this trilogy."
2,Not worth it,"After reveiwing this book, I returned it. Any child who was having difficulty passing the FCAT would not take the time to read through (much less comprehend) the ""tips"" to passing the test. Your time would be better spent having your child work through problems similar to those on the FCAT."
3,Lots of Fun; Not for the Audiophile,"This is a pretty cute device that will delight kids of all ages. Unfortunately, as a speaker you could do far better. The speaker is very small and encased in plastic, rendering the sound very tinny. It'll do in a pinch, but you're better off using earphones or even PC speakers if you really want semi-decent sound quality.BTW, the flashing lights are fairly intense: in a dark room with this toy as the only light source, your eyes will quickly become uncomfortable (unless you enjoy staring at strobe lights!)."
4,A very good RCIA resource,"This book, like the cycle A and C books, deals with the Gospel readings for the Cycle B year of the Latin Rite Catholic lectionary. It gives pertinent information on the Mediteranean culture and the times in which Jesus lived. This allows us a deeper insight into Jesus' teachings, and their meanings. This is therefore, a very valuable resource for those working in RCIA, adult education, religious education or for someone who just wants a deeper understanding of the Gospels. Each week is covered by an essay ranging from two to four pages in length. It is written in very easy to understand language making the whole learning process easier andmore enjoyable. I highly recommend this set of books."
2,"Cultural, yes...Catholic doctrine? No.","This book may cover the cultural milieu of the Gospels very well, but there is a good reason it carries no Imprimatur or Nihil Obstat. Earlier in the year, Pilch's gloss on a gospel passage was that it indicated the need for the United States to pass a system of universal healthcare...I kid you not. But this Sunday (2nd of Easter, the appearance of the resurrected Jesus to doubting Thomas) was the last straw. Pilch reads this passage as the apostles experiencing an ""altered state of consciousness"". In other words, the resurrection was a mirage.Please, please do not rely on this book for RCIA formation, at least not anything other than the strictly cultural, historical background information."
2,Beware 3rd Party Sellers,"This book was advertised as new, still in the wrapper. The book was not new. There were penciled-in remarks throughout the book. Several pages were starting to come out of the book. The wrapper was obviously applied by the owner of the book."
4,Love this musical!,Probably the best version of Les Miserable made! Excellent acting! No one can play Jean Valjean better than Liam Neeson!
1,Not up to TurboTax standards!,"I absolutely love using Turbotax for my taxes. I tried the chief competitor one year (stunk). I tried a tax professional (horrific, no understanding, fixed THEIR errors, and got charged extra for it). But TurboTax is consistently a great product.The promoted estimated tax service online & the software are not well thought out and requires so much hacking that most people will likely give up and make a $0 ""quick"" estimate. I hope they don't get penalized.I have trained 1000s of people in software and other technology aspects so I am very comfortable with software. I am NOT comfortable with this software and I am strongly considering dumping the TurboTax I love and going to a local accountant that can make me comfortable about paying my quarterly estimate."
5,Extreme Truth,"This book is really awesome, i got so many of them and also recommended many of my friends to read it. This book is exceptional compared to all other normal christian books, it talks about the real faith and our role in God's plan.I can understand that this book will be an eye opener for any one who uses it. I dont say that this book is perfect, but it is really a key to understand the bible more and more.Hope all who buys will be blessed spiritually and will be matured in their faith..."
4,Excellent Value - and just what I wanted.,"When I do Yoga in the house I want a CD that blanks out the normal creaks groans and thumps around the house. This does this and much more. The CD gives a very realistic sound of waves breaking on a pebble beach. As the waves recede you can hear the water gurgle through the pepples. There is some background seagull calling, but not too much to be intrusive. Just enough to enhance the atmosphere.There is no music or backing track, just the natural sound of the sea breaking in a short chop.The rythym of the waves is perfect for yoga, as it is close to the rythym of breathing, and helps concentration on the breath. The sound is relaxing, there are not changes in track, and it really allows you to slide away from the now into deep meditation."
1,not to my tastes,"Most of the waves don't flow, so much as crash. You can hear them building up slowly, and then *BOOM*. They crash loudly and harshly. I found the effect to be a bit stressing, rather than relaxing. If that is what you are after, however, then go for it."
3,NOT FOR SLEEPING TO!,"This cd is not good to sleep to becuase the waves crash more than anything. I gave it a three because of the idea I got from another reviewer to use it for yoga. It also can help you to center your mind during meditation, or you can listen to it while cleaning the house. Again this cd is NOT for sleeping to."
4,Good workout and great value.,"I use this and Menezes' book to help me establish a workout and get guidance on technique. This isn't as expensive as the other DVDs I saw at the time and it has three levels of workout all viewable separatley. It is a well structured DVD I like it a lot and I am picky. Now, for those of you that are Pilates uber-freaks that do all the Cadillacs and Reformers and the lot this isn't gonna be tough enough for you. For those that aren't paying oodles of cash to attend a class regularly, this will do nicely, especially with some beginner's experience under your belt."
3,Slow Paced Pilates,"Being more used to a fast paced Pilates sequence, I was a bit disappointed with this video. This video covered a lot of the common sequences that I'm familiar with but at a much slower pace. The instructions were very clear and there were three different modifications depending on your level which I thought was great. If you're new to Pilates, I'd highly recommend it."
2,Little Workout,This is a very slow meditative workout. It's okay if you want to relax. The area where it was filmed is gorgeous.
2,"good workout, bad name","this is a good workout, but the name is misleading. YOu have to have more cardio and better nutrition to lose weight, and this is not emphasized enough in her routine. Deason is ok, but i think other Pilates vids are better."
3,not for beginners,"This video has incredibly beautiful scenery in the background. The video starts with breathing exercises on a white sand beach in Maui with black volcanic rock and the vividly blue ocean just feet away. The video then takes you to Upcountry Maui with a wonderful ocean view in the background for the Pilates movements.It is a peaceful serene setting. Gorgeous...simply awesome.However, the instructor moves from movement to movement quickly without much explanation. If you know the Pilates movements -- great. If you don't -- it's confusing and frustrating. I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone new at Pilates. Even with the beautiful scenery -- when you're being inundated with ""breathe, move, change"" ...it's too much and the benefits are lost."
4,Effective Pilates Workout,"I'm in good shape. I do pilates and core and yoga classes at the gym and I lift weights and do cardio. This is a challenging video for me to get through and in a good way. If you read the reviews that say this is an easy class, its because those people aren't engaging their core correctly. I like the fact that it has a creating awareness section that helps you connect to your core muscles on days you may need that and you can skip over that section on days you don't need it. I find all of Susan Deeson's videos to be challenging and positive. Again, disregard the reviews that says this workout is ""easy"". They aren't doing it right and if you are a beginner, even if its kind of boring take time to do the creating awareness section so you can get the most out of engaging your core."
4,Great for Beginners,"Though you probably won't burn as many calories as you would in a typical 60 minute workout, this is great if you're starting out with Pilates. It can be modified based on your level. It also gives you a chance ot figure out the breathing, etc. I didn't care too much for the lower body segment."
3,Great introduction to Pilates,"This is a great DVD to own if you have never done Pilates before. The instruction and the cueing is excellent. The three workouts help your body adjust to the type of stretching and toning of pilates. However, if you want to burn calories and lose weight, YOU HAVE TO DO CARDIO along with practicing Pilates. Pilates helps tone the muscles and adds flexibily to the body. This video helps you find your flexibility level and introduces you to proper breathing techniques. After a couple of months, with daily practice, you probably will grow out of the workouts. But, I recommend it for anyone just starting Pilates and wants to begin a healthy and fun way to tone your body."
3,Shameless advertizing,"The workout is OK, but I hate being forced to watch advertizing every time I put the DVD on. It can't be turned off, the player has to play it through till the main manu opens. This seems to be a standard business practice with Gaiam, I also own their Yoga Conditioning DVD, and the ads there are even longer. This is not a free product, I paid money for it, what do I have to be forced to watch what I don't want?"
2,toooo slow!,"I guess I expected something that would get my pulse going, or at least something more difficult. I felt it was to easy and quite boring. If I could I return it..."
3,Good learning tool,"If you're looking to learn how to perform pilates moves properly this is a great video. It is also very relaxing with beautiful waterfall and ocean scenery in the background.I did not, however, find this to be an intense workout (not that Pilates should be intense, but I would like to feel like I'm doing something). She generally only does 6 repetitions of a move, which I don't find to be enough to really work the various muscle groups. She also spends a lot of time going through instructions for the various levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced), unless you choose the workout designed specifically for beginner or intermediate (which means you can't vary between levels on the different moves).I don't mind doing this workout to cool off from a long stressful day, but if I'm really looking to tone, or ""loose weight"" as this video proclaims, I go elsewhere."
3,Not too hard to do if you have no experience with Pilates,This was my first experience ever with Pilates. This video was not hard to follow. It will take a few times to get the breathing right. Focus is on the abdominals. No way will doing this video alone help melt off pounds. I will need to combine this with other exercise and of course diet.
2,Dont waste your time....,This title is very deceiving. It is slow moving and I dont feel that it will do much for weight loss. The background is beautiful and the music is relaxing but if you are looking for a workout this isnt the DVD for you. The workout is long and boring and the instructors pause too long between exercises. This is more for someone who wants to tone up or is into yoga. I would recommend something a little more involved if you are looking for a weight loss DVD.
1,Wish I could return the tape,"This tape was a total waste of money. Through the whole 60 minutes, I kept thinking this was a warm up and that we'd be getting to the challenging stuff soon. I get more exercise getting off the couch for a snack!! I began with the Method Pilates tape for toning with Jennifer Kries. I thought that one was kind of lame too but I got way more of a workout than with this one."
1,Hardly worth the time spent,"This is truly for beginners. Didn't even break a sweat. Way too much detailed instruction, not enough workout."
2,TOO SOFT,"It would be a good Dvd for elderly people, but I don't think that anybody is gonna loss weight with it. After doing the whole workout (45 minutes) my heart rate was 44!!! Good for relaxing and streching,but not for lossing a pound. NOT FOR FITNESS LOVERS!"
1,"Boring, especially if you've done pilates before","I have taken pilates classes at my women's gym for about six months, and a while ago I bought this DVD in case I couldn't make classes. That was four months ago, and I have used it two times! I wish I could return it.The scenery is lovely and the instructor's positions are impressive, but she doesn't do enough repetitions to make me sweat. It didn't even feel like a warm-up--just a nap with my eyes open. My gym's beginner class is more challenging, and way more interesting.This might be a good way to introduce yourself to pilates, but when you've become better, upgrade to something better."
3,Great for a beginner.,"This dvd would be great for a beginner, or for someone who's looking for a workout that's not too intimidating, but I was hoping for something more intense. It never really got my heart rate up and I never felt too challenged. I use this workout when I'm feeling a bit run down or when I need to relax, but still get a workout. I do appreciate her focus on breath and body awareness. Also, if you know some pilates parts of this dvd can drag. I knew a lot of the exercises in the dvd, so I was a bit bored at times, listening to the explanation of each exercise."
1,"Slow, repetitive, and no weight loss will occur","A complete disappointment, this DVD is irritatingly repetitive as it states the 3 different positions to take based on your level of fitness for EVERY single move. This takes alot of time. Additionally, one only gets a few repetitions of every move, not enough to work the muscle.I will not do it again and do not recommend it if you are looking for a decent level of strength and toning (and I'm not that fit)."
5,Very Well,"I have been doing this workout for a couple of months, and I like it. You are given three levels to follow. The third is the most challenging. I tried level one for the first month, then I moved to the third after that.The tape does work well for beginners, such as I. But if you want to see great results, you must reach the thrid level in this exercise. Otherwise, you will be waiting for a very long time to see results.I lost lots of weight and my muscles are toned much more!!!!Try it out, you'll see results as you work up to the third level. It is a good workout, and is still very challenging."
3,"OK, but I'd buy something else.","I thought this was a decent workout, especially for a beginner like me, but I was a little disappointed because of the following:1) The workout was a little on the easy side, and too short.2) The different workout levels only vary slightly - they're effectively the same workout but different people are doing slight modifications. So, you're really only getting one ~30 minute workout here.3) The ""weight loss"" part of this is pretty thin - a bunch of ""mind-body"" fluff that if you just take control of your life blah blah... If you do this workout *exactly* I seriously doubt you're going to lose much weight - it's not aerobic enough.4) There was virtually no attention paid to the upper body.If you like Suzanne Deason I would point you to her balance ball DVD (which incorporates some Pilates or at least Pilates-inspired elements), which is much more of a workout and a much better purchase in my opinion."
3,Great Exercise -- NOT for WEIGHT LOSS,"I performed the exercises almost daily for 3 months and lost less than 3 pounds. My core muscles are already strong, so I was doing the ""advanced"" track on all the exercises. I enjoy the scenery, the sounds, the positions and the pace. I found Deason's voice to be acceptable (I find the sound of most recorded exercise instructor's voices to be irritating, but not Deason's).This tape actually DID 2 other wonderful things for me:1) Decreased a double-chin that I was starting to get so that now I know I'll never have to have one (I can just return to these exercises).2. Reduced my thigh cellulite puckering.Some people may find that this exercise routine helps you lose weight - lucky you! For the rest of us - we'll need something more aerobic! If Deason would only rename this to ""Pilattes for Reducing Your Double-Chin and Cellulite"", I'd give it 5 stars."
2,Didn't care for it,"I started off using 30 Minute Quick Start - Pilates for Weight Loss with Ana Caban and loved her video but wanted to see if there was a similar video for those days when I have more time to devote to working out. I thought the two videos would be similar (becasue they were both pilates conditions for weight loss) but was wrong! Pilates Conditioning for Weight Loss with Suzanne Deason was okay if you are a beginner or like a great explanation for everything (over and over again!). I found that the workout was really slow because she explained everything in great detail (good for beginners). It was so slow that I was getting bored during my workout. There was long pauses between each workout because there was too much talking!!! After using this video a few times, I just wanted to workout not hear the explanation a thousand times!!! It would have a been better if there a selection in the menu for people who already previewed the video so we could just workout!"
2,"Not a workout, only for extreme beginners","I found this video to be definitely not for me. I have a little experience with Pilates, so the moves were much too basic. Even if I had no experience, there is minimal cardio benefit and is mostly used for strengthening abs. Even if you're interested in strengthening your core, I would HIGHLY suggest looking for another Pilates or yoga video. The pace for this one is much too slow and I found myself waiting much too long in resting poses for the next instruction."
2,okay for relaxation but....,"I bought this dvd primarily for its long running time - figured it would be a good value and would be a tougher workout than some of the shorter dvds. there is a lot of good instruction but much of the time is wasted on ""mind-body"" connection type stuff that some people might like, but does little for conditioning. also, even the ""advanced"" instructor (there are three levels presented) did not present particularly challenging moves and wasted a lot of time getting into the next position. if you continue the reps while the instructor is explaining the next position, it would be an okay workout, but would definitely not lead to any cardio benefits. the scenery is very nice but the three instructors aren't particularly attractive, one of whom seemed a bit chubby - which is not very motivating!"
1,A complete waste of time,"I bought this workout hoping for some challenging exercises, and got a bunch of stretches and breathing. I did the advanced version, and was so bored I could have fallen asleep. I have trouble believing that even the most out of shape person could lose weight using this workout. I'm very disappointed, after hearing that Pilates is so popular and a great way to stay in shape, I basically burned my money buying this DVD.The weight loss claim is tatamount to false advertising, and I'm surprised that their lawyers will even let them say this anywhere on the tape, let alone in the title. Stay away from this one if you really want to get in shape!"
4,A Mathematical wonder: not for the faint of heart!,"The book opens up ideas of wonderful depth, but isn't easy reading for those who hate equations. I would put this book in the top ten must read area for fractal people! Your unique Associates ID is: thefractaltransl"
5,..and if she cannnot be had she most certainly can be killed,"Wow! Donna has done it again with the most realistic depection of this horrible stalking problem which plagues our nation. To lift a few words from Donna's book...A finger of apprehension traced Carolyn's spine. Her tired brain went to full alert as her gaze scanned the room. A plant from the garden window above the sink now sat on the counter, and her oven light was on... I don't know about other readers, but I do know that this is a perfect description of how one feels when something like ""stalking"" is going on in ones life...I felt my nervous system zoom from zero to sixty in about one second. This book is some of the most compelling writing I have read in a long time. I love this authors writing!"
4,nice thriller for a rainy night,"I have read several thrillers by Donna Anders. Reviewers frequently criticize her books, saying that they are like a Lifetime movie. This is true, but sometimes you just like to lock the doors, check in the closet and under the bed, and settle down to read a scary book, and aren't looking for a literary experience. ""In All the Wrong Places"" is just the kind of book I like to read on a rainy night around Halloween time. Viewers of QVC should really enjoy this book, because the main character is the host of a shopping channel. I just finished reading a thriller by Mary Higgins Clark, and found that the character development, plot, and fright level was not nearly as good as Donna Anders' books. If you want to be scared, this book is a great choice!"
1,Oh so agonizingly slow,"Sorry Ms. Anders. I just couldn't get through it. I got to page 100 and was ready to pull my hair out with the slow pace and the flat, two-dimensional feel of the characters. The story seemed forced at times and it was all I could do not to scream.And come on, this is a woman living alone and she just ignores all the signs that people have been in her house? No self-respecting woman living alone would be so careless - and not immediately call a cop friend to get some reassurance. From the parts I skimmed over, it appears Carolyn finally got her game on, except for the marriage.Since I figured out ""who done it"" pretty quickly, I just skipped to the end to see if the led heroine finally got her stuff together. Thankfully, she did,but not in time to save my sanity."
2,"So far, so slow...","I guess I shouldn't rate this book so early, seeing as how I'm only on about Chapter 5, but MAN, is this book SLOW!! I've read such great reviews on this book (with just a couple of bad ones) and so far, I can't imagine how this slow-starter can be good!! Plus, it's so much LONGER than 'average' who-dun-it books. I will continue to drag thru this book, just out of curiousity if it gets any better/easier to read!!!"
2,"Sorry, but","Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this book, but I did not like it. It seemed slow to start and the things happening in the book did not seem as suspenseful as they should have been. I picked out the person behind everything from the very beginning and I really had to force myself to get to the end (skipping and skimming mostly). Hopefully it was just my mood, if not buy with caution."
4,Good Tournament Times,"This book is crucial for any who want to participate in casino tournaments. Generally, in these tournaments you are not playing against the casino, but against other players. Since this is very different than normal play, it is very different. This book gives you a much greater advantage than the other players with whom you are competing. With thousands and thousands of dollars available in prize money, the cost of this book is insignificant in comparison to the gains it can potentially earn you."
2,"Not so Cheap price, but cheap seats","Ordered these thru Amazon, thinking they might have more control on quality. Surprise. Seats are not as shown in picture, one had the 3A Racing logo sewn into the headrest (big), and the other was just embossed with the logo (Not even the same logo). Seat operators were not same from seat to seat. They were 'universal' mount, although sold as fitments for our car.By the time this all came together, shipping boxes were discarded, and way too big of a hassle to correct (with no guarantee we wouldn't have the same problem. The dealer for 3A (items from China) have NO good reviews, and now find that BBB has dropped them.Thanks Amazon."
1,WORST MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SHOES,"These shoes are very cute at first glance but once you put them on, the buckle rubs against your foot and causes really painful blisters. This shoe is poorly designed. I love Sam Edelman shoes but this one is the WORST. You can't even walk in them without having extreme pain from the buckle rubbing against your foot and causing severe blisters. I wish I could return them. Not worth the money."
4,Cute shoes!,"These shoes are so cute! I love them and I love the peach color, too. The only thing is that they are not made for walking..haha...if worn for a long time, they will start to hurt! But they are worth the pain!"
1,cell phone battery cover,This is the second cover I have ordered and it is the same as the first one. The cover is too short for the Motorola V3i cell phone. It is not worth the effort(money)to get back to the supplier.
3,Just what I needed at a reasonable price,"I needed to replace my Pioneer AVIC-S1 car charger. Called Pioneer - ""Sure! We have the replacement part! Just go to our parts website."" When I did - yikes! $37.00! I found the website of the manufacturer, but it's not avaialble anywhere other than Pioneer. So, with a little research I found out that this is simply a USB-Mini plug car charger. I went to Amazon and found this one for 1-cent! With $2.98 shipping - well can I say anymore? Great price - not the fanciest, maybe not the highest quality, but hey! I can buy a heck of alot more of these and still not pay as much as Pioneer Electronics wanted."
1,garbage,"Don't buy this item, when you go cheap you get cheap, this has caused my battery on the phone to not work."
2,not a good charger.,I am really disappointed with this product. It will not always charge the phone when it is plugged in the vehicle.
2,Already Broken! :-(,"This was great until it broke! I opened it up to see what was rattling inside after it stopped working. A small piece of plastic that holds the spring in place broke, so it's trash now :-( It was cheap but very functional and is probably the standard you'll find on the market. I just purchased another one today, hopefully it will last as long as an original . . ."
4,Great Price,My parents needed a charger for their RAZRs so instead of paying $15+ I got them this. Its an amazing deal that you shouldn't pass up.
1,Didn't hold up,"I can't complain for the price, I figured if it didn't work out, I wasn't out much and it didn't. After only using it a couple of times, it broke. It's not worth my time and postage to return it....oh well."
4,I love this set!,I bought this set for cleaning my M-16/M-4 in the National Guard. It really speeds up cleaning the firing pin assembly. I took a star off because the case is so cheap.
4,Met my needs,"These are by no means the best quality wax carvers you can get, but i purchased them for gun cleaning. So they met my needs."
4,Good product,"This was originally advertised as a dental set, but when it arrived the case said that it was a clay scultping kit, asside from small differences they're pretty close to real dental tools... bear in mind I'm just a layman and not a dentist."
2,Not US Compatible,I cannot review the movie because I cannot watch it. It is not formatted for US DVD players. It is not clear from the Amazon description that this is not a universal format.
5,Textbook for Experiencing the Holy Spirit's Life,"This is the best book I have read on the subject of experiencing the Holy Spirit's work. The author, understanding most people's difficulty in relating to the Holy Spirit, offers very practical help in learning to know various aspects of the Holy Spirit's ministry in the life of the Christian from salvation to sanctification to the release of spiritual gifts for works of service. The information is helpful toward relating to the Holy Spirit as a Person and not some ""Force"" or power. It is most encouraging and reviving. I would heartily recommend it as a textbook to be offered to new believer's and quite insightful to mature believer's. This book is filled with Scripture references to reinforce each point along with exciting personal testimonies. It's well worth the price."
3,am pilates okay but pm sucks,"I got this tape as a present due to my new interest in pilates. I found the am pilates tape to be easy and fun. The pm tape, however, was very difficult. The cover stated it could be used by everyone, however, I found it to be advanced."
2,Problems,"I bought this receiver for a 5.1 system using Polk audio speakers. The sound quality for music was amazing, very clean. However when I tried it on movies the rear speakers would cut in and out when the sound track would get quiet. It was very subtle at first, I had to put my ear right in the rear speakers. But it was definately noticable. I tried different speakers, different wire and several different settings but the soundtrack on the rear speakers would still cut in and out. It might have been a receiver problem another unit might have worked fine, but I returned it and ordered a Yamaha RX-V659. I would highly recommend the Yamaha, outstanding sound quality, lots of power, and many features."
2,Does not support HDMI audio!!,"This receiver is a joke. Even though it has two HDMI inputs, it won't play the audio from those inputs. You need to set up a separate audio input. What's the point of having HDMI then?!?"
2,Sound Quality - You get what you pay for,"I was upgrading from a 6 year old JVC that was about $150 new at the time. The Onkyo sounded worse and had poorer build quality.It has great features for the money, but ultimately you get what you pay for. I returned it after a couple of weeks. I bought a Marantz SR-4001 for about twice the price and I'm happy."
3,ok but prefer yammy,it is ok for the money but my 10 year old yammy is a more soild complete and bass pushing unit. I guess if I had to do it all over again I would have stayed with the yammy. I also do not like the red led light that stays on standy which is actually off. Also I prefer that it had a switched plug.
4,Future Proof,"I purchased this receiver because it offered all the features I required. My current setup is 5.1 but this system will allow me to easily transition to 7.1 It comes with three connections. My only gripe was that it required an additional conection for audio. The HDMI cable would only passthru the video signal, audio has to come through a separate connection. There goes the simple setup solution. Other than that, this is a wonderful unit that offers many highend features of more expensive units."
1,Onkyo went Boinko,"Hooked up the speakers, HD cable box and HD tv only. Was working great for about 2 weeks. Then one night we lost picture. There was a pop from the receiver followed by smoke. Will be taking it in for warranty service but you can't help but wonder what else is going to happen when you start hooking up additional devices."
4,Like the Self Calibration,"I purchased this Onkyo for my basement home theater. This is my first Onkyo, and I initially purchased it because of the good reviews assosiated with Onkyos in general. I really think the audio quality out of this receiver is great. It has lots of surround options, including options to create 7.1 mixes from 5.1 sources. This lets you really envelope yourself in sound.I really liked the self calibration procedure that utilizes an included microphone. It helped me get the speakers balanced properly to account for differences in sensitivity and location. The sound before and after calibration was night and day.It also includes a surround processor that sends a stereo music source to the surround speakers. I usually don't care for the sound processors in receivers, but this Onkyo sounds great and has a lot of flexibility."
4,Onkyo TX-SR505 7.1 good entry-level receiver,Good power and features. Only con is that the HDMI inputs are merely passthroughs and the receiver cannot get audio through them.
4,Good all around receiver,"I bought this receiver almost a year ago. I must say that I have been almost completely satisfied. The best thing about it is the upconverting to 780p or 1080i and only having to run 1 cable to the TV. I have 4 sources running to the receiver and it was really easy to connect it to the TV.My main, really only, complaint is it can take time two switch between sources. It takes about 3-5 seconds when I make the switch.Another thing I wish it had was RDS for the radio. I've found that to be somewhat annoying, but that is more of a missing feature. Sound quality is fairly good, though not the best. I'm happy with the product and I am sure it will last me a long time."
4,nice,"After researching and looking for 2months I decided on the 505[$269 at CC] and hooked them to my new polk rm750 5.1 speaker system. I was a little concerned with the 505 watts per channel.Not to worry.Plenty of power for a normal size room.It brings out the best in the polk's.I like the many listening modes I can choose from.The manual does a nice job explaining what mode fits best with what your watching but I wish it would suggest what mode to watch a game in.The speaker hookups are a little frustrating but be patient,good thing's take time.For about $550 I have a nice system that will last. It beats the Pioneer HTIB I had for 10 years.I listened to a Jeff Beck song on sirrus net work,cranked it up to 40 or so ,very nice.Be patient and look for the sales."
5,Great Snack Bags,I carry these with me everywhere. They make for a very healthy snack especially since they're organic and unsalted. They're roasted for the perfect taste and crunch. My favorite almonds..
5,Awesome,"These are Real Quality Almonds. You can definitely taste the flavor. Pefect Size Snack Packs, and roasted to perfection. Will be buying more!"
2,Mileage may Vary,"You may get better results than I did, if you already know how to gild. Mine came out terrible. I tried following the directions, and I also tried without using the red basecoat (my surface was already sealed). I got the same results both ways. One thing that would have been helpful, and which I had to look up online elsewhere, is if the instructions stated that you're not supposed to try to burnish off the extra leaf until you let the size dry overnight. If you're using this for something like lettering, it will smear."
1,THIS IS NOT GOLD LEAF,"Title says GOLD LEAF, the product description has GOLD LEAF in it, but look closely and you'll find ""COMPOSITE LEAF"" at the very end of the description.Talk about a bait-in-switch. This leaf has NO GOLD in it. Instead they sell you COMPOSITE GOLD, which is 85% copper and 15% zinc.Oh but wait, they produce the same effect same right?NO! Copper and Zinc OXIDIZE UNLESS PROPERLY SEALED.SKIP THIS PRODUCT AND BUY THE REAL THING!!!"
1,"Rcvd a box-NONE of the 4 jars of coating. To get what I PAID for, I PAY MORE to send back EMPTY box? Unreal.",I was not able to experience this item because I received an empty box with none of the four jars of coating that I anticipated receiving.
5,More than meets the eye,"Easy to handle with a couple of clever tricks that make it even better that it appears initially.1. The back cover is shaped like a magnifying glass so you get a nice clear picture underwater for better framing and shooting.2. Functions in the camera change when using the 'housing on' position so you can do things like reviewing your shots without removing the camera from the housing.Totally delighted with it, I have only had it for a weekend and I love it already."
5,Impress the Peeps,"The best way to get your friends involved in SCUBA is to show them pictures of your exploits. I love this casing, its easy to use and resilient. My only complaint was that Amazon contacted me two days before my trip to let me know they had no more in stock (after about 10 days of waiting) and I had to buy from another vendor online, so make sure you're not running against a deadline when you order."
5,"Awesome, Underwater pics so easy and safe","Used it for scuba pictures (up to 20 mts)and they were great, used it to take the cammera to the beach so sand wount ruin it, it is great, also for surf action pictures."
4,Marine pack,"I have not actually taken this underwater yet, but it appears to be well made and of similar quality to other cases. It keeps theover-all size of the camera/case down to a size that could fit into a BC pocket. On the downside, it does have only limited functionality of the camera through the available buttons. You can zoom and telephoto, change from camera,playback and to movie mode and shoot the picture. You cannot do any of the setup functions while it is in the case. Regarding a stobe, Sony makes one that looks a little cheezy. There is a ""universal"" strobe by Sea Life (SL 960D) that fits, but the fiber-optic trigger is just taped onto the flash of the camera. I'm waiting to how this works. One replacement O-ring comes with the case-replacements from sony were outrageously expensive. Color-correcting (red) lenses are about $100 from sony, but not needed if you use a strobe. (unless maybe to shoot movies?)."
5,The human spirit is what makes this book a must have!,"I found this book on a recent to Puerto Rico to visit family. The book creates an immediate respect for the land of Puerto Rico. The interviews bring you right there to glimpse into the lives of the midwifes (curanderos) and healers.Maria Benedetti, a NewYorican empirical herbalist, paints a beautiful picture of what it was like to go ""home"" for the first time in 1987 to work on this book. Her love for the people presented in the book shine through. She illustrates the need to ""conserve Puerto Rico's herbal wisdom and resources.""The book also contains a section on medicinal plants and how to prepare remedies, two indices on medicinal plants by name and family (Spanish and English) and a Puerto Rican glossary.If you are intersted in green medicine, the Caribbean or enjoy the human experience, this book is a MUST!!!"
4,Without title,"I'm so satisfied with the product. I'm a Brazilian jazz fan and I don't like to write a lot because I can't speak English very well, but I recommend this CD for people who like this style of jazz."
3,A True Soccer Fan...,"just does not describe this man. He recollection of events in his life as they pertain to Arsenal soccer games is relentless. I thought I was obsessed with certain things in my life but compared to Nick Hornby, I am not even close. Amazed to think there are several thousand people who feel the same way about soccer as he does. Nothing like the movie."
2,I've been misled.,"I feel that this is more of a biography of the author, rather than a book about Arsenal. This would not be so bad if the author had an interesting life. Unfortunately for the reader, (and Nick Hornby) he did not."
2,"Probably not bad, just bad for me","I picked this book out on Amazon before I read any of Hornby's books because it was the highest rated book of his. I didn't know it was a 250-page book about his personal love of soccer (or football). Hornby's English. There are a lot of football fans in England. If I lived in England, I'd be a football nut too. But reading this book was like listening to steeplechase nuts recount the best races they'd ever witnessed. I was hoping it might turn into an examination of the global fanaticism surrounding the sport, but it became a very personal description of Hornby's love affair with the game, and I was more fascinated by why someone would write a game-by-game description of twenty-year-old soccer seasons. Hornby's a good writer, but I'd recommend this only to someone who really really really loves soccer."
1,only for soccer-addicts,"I didn't finish this book. Seems that I am not enough of a soccer addict or an englishman to find this book interesting or funny.The fun is anyway rather the kind of fun that critics see as funny (very ""intellectual"")."
2,READ THIS TOO MANY SOCCER FANS DOING REVIEWS,"Fever Pitch is, at best, average. Seeing how there are about a hundred Amazonians who gave this book a glowing review, you'll probably never get to this little warning, but that's what I'm giving you. I know everyone reading the book can relate to being a fan of a longtime losing team, it doesn't just have to be Arsenal it could be the Cubs or the Red Sox or any team that you really have a passion for... so? The problem with this book is unless you are a soccer fan or English or (God help you) both, then the book just doesn't make it. It's an autobiograph about a soccer (that's right soccer not football) fan. That's it, end of story. Not ""tears-running-down-your-face funny"" as GQ's review on cover promised. Not even that good ultra-violence that's in other soccer books. So me druggies, don't viddy-well."
2,Be warned! This book is not as accessible as his later work,"Just a quick, simple warning to potential buyers who liked ""High Fidelity"" and/or ""About A Boy"": ""Fever Pitch"" is not quite in the same vein. It's a fine book on footie--and is the perfect gift for any Arsenal fan--but the book should more accurately be titled ""Literary Journal of an Arsenal Fan."" Each mini-chapter is catalogued by a specific Arsenal match (score, date, and pitch), and although there're some autobiographical vignettes about life/love, these are few and far between amidst pages and pages of discussion about Arsenal -- the team, its players, its matches, its history. In short, and I submit this review only to distinguish this book from Hornby's later stuff (and because I saw it being touted on the Amazon splashpage): ""Fever Pitch"" is not fiction, and there's not much of a plot. And unless you're already a moderate football fan, you're gonna' be bored and disappointed."
3,hornby's the best,"this is my least favorite of all of mr. hornby's books, but even this one shows his incredible insight and thoughfulness. certainly worth reading once you've read (in this order) 'high fidelity,' 'about a boy' and 'how to be good.'"
2,Not funny or interesting,"""High Fidelity"" was very funny and at times thought provoking. This novel was a big disappointment. I am not a sports fan in any way (although I was at the age of 10). Perhaps you need to be a sports fan (and Anglophile?) to appreciate this. I found the book excruciatingly trivial. Don't look to ""Fever Pitch"" for insight into ""fandom"" either. The theme of arrested male development is dealt with much more effectively in ""High Fidelity""."
3,This guy is definitely a soccer fan,"I liked the way this book was set out, in a diary kind of way with the date but also the game played on that date, obviously this guy likes his football. I can sympathise a little being an AFL supporter, there have been times certain get-togethers or functions have been moved around and juggled with to be certain the game was not missed and times of astonishment at some people planning events on football days - um, hello, a wedding on Grand Final Day! That day was a hard one but my team wasn't in it so it sure could have been a lot worse.I liked going through Nick's journey, finding out how it all started, how it affected his life - work, relationships, family, etc. I think had I been a football/soccer fan myself I may have appreciated it a little bit more but all in all a good read and very worthy of three stars."
4,A book for everyone....(especially if you are a boy),"This was the first of Nick Hornby's books that I read and as a result I went out and bought the other two and loved them all. I think any guy can associate with the characters in the books, I know I can!! But its not only for guys, Hornby writes so simply but yet you get the feeling that you know the characters like a good friend. You dont have to know about soccer or music because the real story is about the characters and all their faults... but you gotta love them!"
3,"Not bad, but never engaged me","I like Nick Hornby and I'm an Arsenal fan, so I should have loved this book...but I didn't.Maybe I'm just not a fan of memoirs, or maybe a memoirist has to have a more interesting life than Hornby's, but I was just never caught up in this book. I was never wondering what was going to happen, never wondering how things were going to work out. If I hadn't been an Arsenal fan, I probably would have put this down one day and never picked it up again, not because it's bad but because it's forgettable. It just meanders from one random, wry musing to another.A word of warning: if you don't know anything about English soccer, you might have a hard time following this book. Do words like ""Anfield"" and ""Gazza"" ring any bells? If not, you're not part of the target audience, and it could be tough going."
4,Fever Pitch is a novel to which you can relate.,"Nick Hornby's autobiography about his obsession with the Arsenal football club is poignant and well-written. But most of the best of the book is overshadowed by reviews that call this book ""The funniest book of the year!"". What makes the book an especially good read is not Hornby's nostalgic, humorous story-telling, but his discursions to such various subjects as class, male behavior, and identity. The book is also a great description of what it means to be a fan of any sport anywhere. Even the most avid opposer to football (soccer) can identify with Hornby's description of obsessive fanaticism, especially sports fans. Possibly the best facet of the book, however, is how Hornby's obsession with football acts as an embodiment of all his emotions. Everything revolves around football for Hornby. His loves, passions, sadnesses, and joys are rooted in Arsenal."
4,a review from an unlikely reader,"I am a girl. An American girl. An American not-sportsy-in-any-way girl. So, to say that this book was not written for me is a bit of an understatement. Why in hell did I read it then? Because Nick Hornby wrote it. And I enjoyed it. Sure, it was interesting to get a glimpse into the footballing culture, but more so was his fascinating portrayal and dissection of obsession. His description of what it means to be a fan of something, is, sure hilarious, but it also strikes deeply into the core of this nerdy girl who waited in line, in costume, for six hours, for a film of guys wielding laser swords. Obsession/fandom becomes part of one's life, for better or for worse, guides us, builds our relationships, build us. And Hornby describes it perfectly and with affection and criticism. Grade: B+"
5,What a Book!,"Having enjoyed ""High Fidelity"", and wanting to put some perspective around my miserable soccer experience from high school, I read this book. Hornby could be a literary priest he exercised so many demons for me...simply the best money I've spent on a book since Mary Karr's ""Liars Club"". The book describes all the true grit a sport fan is made of. Naturally Hornby gives some wickedly honest insights into ""male thinking patterns"", but the crux of this book is largely devoted to explaining himself...in terms of being an Arsenal fan. Enjoy this book!"
4,"Great movie, very intriguing","I read the novella by Stephen King and wanted to see if the movie came close to capturing the emotion of the book. This movie absolutely did. Parts of it will shock you, and others will thrill you."
3,Flawed but thought provoking...,"This genre is not something i enjoy, and i only watched it because it was cheap and i didn't feel like studying...The flaws that other reviewers have mentioned are definitely there... Nevertheless, i think the movie does work as intended. It is a pretty disturbing plot, in which all the characters are affected in a negative way by the events, and the frequent unfairness and injustice of life is presented rather accurately.Definitely, not a Hollywood ending. I think it was worth 99 cents for those who like this type of movie, but i would rather not have seen it and studied instead..."
4,DILATED PUPIL,"Buoyed by the marvelous performances of Ian McKellen and Brad Renfro, APT PUPIL, Stephen King's expose on the horrors of the Holocaust, manages to entertain and provoke thoughts of this horrible blight on mankind.However, at the heart, I couldn't understand Renfro's obsession with the Holocaust, nor really understand where his cold heart came from. His cruelty in humiliating McKellen during the infamous uniform/march scene, is totally despicable in showing Renfro's callousness. Everything points to the fact that despite McKellen's evil, Renfro's is even worse in that he chooses it for pleasure, rather than the distorted duty of a Nazi soldier.The movie seems a little long at times, but director Bryan Singer keeps things interesting and his evocation of the above mentioned performances, is to his obvious credit."
3,"Interesting, but kind of creepy!!!","The idea that a high school kid would be so interested in learning about the holocaust that he'd track down a local Nazi-in-hiding is ludicrous. And, even if this really could happen, I don't think any kid who actually absorbs the evils of his Nazi teacher could have been a very good kid to begin with! Evil isn't something you teach like a history lesson --- it involves morals and upbringing. This kid was NOT so much an A-student seduced by ""the dark side"" as the film would like us to believe. He was always a little nuts if you ask me."
4,Sure it was disturbing - but it was very good!,"First of all, if you hate can't bear disturbing movies, don't see this one. For the rest of you, I recommend this chillingly captivating tale of a high school student's fascination with the Holocaust. Sure, a few of the choices that Brad Renfro's character makes are not the most typical of a student with his abilities, but his unique character must be considered. Ian McKellan's performance as a retired Nazi is definitely the best aspect of this movie. One minus of this movie was too much of the psychological ""I know this about you, so you better do that"" without enough delivery. On the other hand, a strong plus of the film is that it was just as truthful and engrossing as Schindler's List in its words and visuals despcribing the treatment of Jews during the Holocaust. It provided me with the same type of feelings that I had while watching Shindler's list. Altogether, this film is definitely worth seeing if you can stomach the content."
4,It was... odd.,"I read Stephen King's story in his book Differant Seasons, and it ran chills up my spine. Like always, the movie was not as good as the short story."
2,Apt Pupik,"I LOVED the book. The movie did not, unfortunately, include as much detail as the book. Todd's transformation could have been a little more dramatic."
2,A poor adaption of a great story,"As usual, it seems like the director never reads the book. We all rented this and were disappointed up to the end. Where was the famous scene where the boy shoots at passing cars on the highway? The metal band Anthrax knows more about this story than these movie makers. Check out their song 'Skeletons in the Closet'. That was a great adaption. This movie sucked."
2,"Great setup, but it drags",Ian McKellan is wonderful and the first 1/3 of the movie is great. Then it drags out longer than is really justified.
4,"""Well today I am going to tell you story about an old man..""","This movie was not a horror movie like the preview might stimulate it as being but it is more of a dark drama, until the middle when it starts going into the thriller genre. This movie was as good as it was because of one person, Ian Mckellen. He made the movie and put on a chilling performance as the Neighbor Nazi. The movie's ending I didnt expect it, but it did not have the huge twist like Usual Suspects, Singer's other movie, but I still thought it was neat. Overall for six dollars i felt that this movie was sure worth the price and i would have payed ten to see it."
2,"This movie is sad, sad, sad...","This movie is anything but ""gripping"". At the end of the film, David Schwimmer's character is pathetically weak. Sticking needles in my eyes would be more fun than watching this movie ever again. Unbelievable story and unbelievably bad."
1,Had to stop watching this movie early on!,"Someone recommended this book. I am wondering about him for doing that. I guess our society has just gotten so used to watching sick, sadisitic things in the media that it doesn't seem that awful. But to someone who doesn't watch t.v. any more & almost never will watch an R movie (big mistake to break that rule) it was that awful. To me it had a sadistic feel to it. I think watching things like this, which presumably are to help one be more enlightened, can actually just be desensitizing people to sufferings of others - & animals too, not to mention inspiring an increase in sadistic behaviors. I would give zero stars if I could."
1,too depressing,"All I have to say is that this film is way to depressing. You have to be happy people, this film is way too dark and evil. How can anybody like horror."
4,Good Movie But Sorta Weird In A Way,This was a really good movie. There were lots of disturbing parts to it. Many scenes I will honestly say are not suitable for a lot of people. I went to go and see this in the theatre with my sister and she got so offended by this movie that she had to step out for about 10 minutes. There are some scenes that will bother you like for example where the old guy tries to burn a cat in an oven NOW THAT BOTHERED ME. it had a good storyline it just needed something else to go with it. All around though I WOULD have this movie for my Video Library.
2,Definately NOT the story...,"I know people tell me constantly I'm wrong, but I'm a firm believer that if you plan on making a movie based on a book, you should stay close to the book. This movie, even on it's own, still didn't give me chills, much less when compared to the book. I guess I expected a LOT more from the director of a classic like The Usual Suspects. This movie was 2 hours I'll never get back, and for that I'm saddened."
2,No where near as good as King's story.,"I read King's novella ""Apt Pupil"" about 5 years ago, and I thought it was the best King writing I had ever read up to that point. When I heard about the movie I was very anxious to see it. I was very dissapointed. This movie does a great job of following the storyline until about halfway through the movie, then they just left out too much stuff for me. The ending was no where near right, It is rare to see a movie contradict a book this badly."
5,AMAZING!!!!!,"This was one of the best movies i have bought from being on amazon, i got it in record time. The condition was great and i love watching it.i idk what else to say but the movie is a great movie,and i recomend it to everyone who ask about it."
3,One of the best King's adaptations,"Even though it's one of the best Steven King's adaptations it can't be rated more than 3 out of 5. Steven King is a kind of writer that just can't be put to the screen without large damage done. But Apt Pupil's story is one of the simplest compared to others (or maybe is not, as usual, but I didn't see the second and the third layers because I read the book only one time) and Brian Singer is a very good director so he has done it in the best possible way. The ending is totally different from the one of the book, but is not worse (and not better either). After the movie you will get the book from the shelf to re-read it as I did yesterday."
2,RENT DON'T BUY,"This movie is okay, but, its not worth what they're charging so just rent it. You'll most likely have no desire to see it again. The only good part is the naked locker room scene with the jocks."
1,Don't bother,i like suspense and examination of the evil in the human mind as much as the next person. However i felt that this movie fell far bellow what it aimed for. The movie completely lacked subtlety and was not as intense as i had expected. It possesed niether the the subtle phsycological horror nor the jump in your face and scare you horror. Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this junk
1,Apt Pupil,"I got this through an Amazon approved seller, Movie Mars. It doesn't play. A message shows up on my screen that I am unauthorized to watch this video and to consult the owner's manual. (The same message also shows up on another movie from Movie Mars, The Wind that Shakes the Barley.) I checked the label on the discs and the label reads that it is PAL (European) format. This won't play on an American DVD player. I contacted Movie Mars, the approved seller. They told me it won't play because I purchased it as ""Region 2"". I can't find anything in their description about PAL format, or Region 2. They will refund my money providing I pay the return postage!! I'm done with Movie Mars and am extremely disappointed in Amazon."
2,cant identify with characters,"Usually when i watch a movie where the protagonist turns to his dark side there is some kind of reason that you can understand for this. In Apt Pupil you never understand why the main character Tod Bodine doesn't turn the old nazi in. Because he Wanted to know what it was realy like? give me a break! Ask a holocaust survivor. the premise is just ridiculous. Any american boy, discounting skin heads, that discoverd a nazi war criminal woulde much more likely turn him in and become a hero not blackmail him for some horror stories."
3,VERY DISTURBING FILM!!,"I saw this movie in the theaters when it came out. From the trailer it looked very good. But I expected a very different movie. When I actully went to go see it, it was the most disturbing, dark and the most evil movie I have ever seen. Although it was very slow it was very compelling. Two girls that I went with were actually crying and wanted to leave the theater. It is a very DISTURBING film. That is the best I can describe it. But it's not surprising because Steven King wrote it. When I left the theater alot of thought went through my mind. Some of the scenes were just too much. This movies definatly shows how evil, evil can be!!!"
4,Interesting but somewhat exaggerated,"For people who have special interest on Nazi Germany, especially on psychology of those Gestapos. I watched the film without getting bored, and liked it very much. I think many people are very much interested about what really happened in the camps like Auschwitz. The young student is also one of them. But what I really didn't like was that the Herr Dussander was much exaggerated, especially on the scene he puts the cat into the oven. The Gestapos are monsters but in a much different way, they cannot be compared with Freddy of the Elm Street. I don't think that an old Nazi looks like Dussander."
3,Drawn-out but almost well-done,"""Apt Pupil"" takes what could have been a spellbinding plot (a sinisterly curious teen tracks down an old soldier from Germany and blackmails him into telling him the atrocities of the holocaust in morbid detail) and makes it into nothing special. The events could be shocking under different direction, but instead get lost in a restrained attempt to make it all seem life-like. The acting, however, is superb. Brad Renfro portrays the right amounts of morbid curiousity and innocence. Ian McKellan (as usual) is right on the money. But their performances were not enough to save the movie."
5,A bone - chilling thriller,This movie is great!! I recommend this movie to anyone who reads Stephen King. The plot is scary as well as the characters. This movie shows the real meaning of evil and is definitely worth buying!
3,"Well made, but novella was a completely different ""FEEL""","I read the book several years ago, and found it moralistic in its own right. Not the movie, though. I came away from the theater with the feeling that I had just witnessed a movie about the honor of Nazism. Dusander's death was portrayed just short of noble, and Todd not only got away with it, but he now has the courage and charisma to go on to be a powerful and successful member of society. I appreciated the film, but found its overall message to the audience disturbing, because it seemed to paint a glorified picture of Nazism.The book was a tragic story of the downward spiral of two people who had played with fire and started a blaze that totally consumed. The movie was borderline propaganda. This said, yes I did find the movie fascinating and yes I plan to own a copy of it someday, BUT I find it hard to recommend it."
2,Movie v. short story,"I have read the short story by Stephen King so when I realized there was a movie made based on it, I had to see it. I was disappointed that the movie people took so many lberties with the story as written by Mr. King. They changed the ending of it, eliminated characters, changed events in the story and never developed the two main characters. My recommendation is to stick with the written story and forgo the movie."
4,"""JUNG FREUDE KINDER KUNST""","This little hidden cousin is perfectly mated to the all too real ""Young Poisoner's Handbook"" - another whiff of dangerous liasons for inquisitive youth. This one's quite rare, almost like little Red Riding Hood's potential offspring [Cain for sure] if she's gone of with Herr Wolf and suitably axed dear old Grandmama.Our golden child. Brad Renfro finds this little old Nazi [comfortably hidden as ""another grumpy old""] in quiet suburbia. Ian McKellen counterpoints his ""Gods and Monsters"" [aka ""Father of Frankenstein""] admirably. Another grand surprise along the way is David Schwimmer's performance as the nosy teacher who meets his uncomfortable match [a ploy so often pulled since Hellman's ""Children's Hour""].Contrary to Stephen King's ending - this one lingers on - possibility of another ""American Psycho"" sequel.Footnote: This is technically the second version - first was with Ricky Schroeder/Nicol Williamson, a brave independent, never completed."
2,nothing 'secret' about it,"This book is okay, but nothing you cannot find in any other book about san francisco. The title is very misleading."
2,P-U,"How did Jennifer Grey go from Ferris Bueller and Dirty Dancing to this junk? NOSE JOB. That was the biggest mistake of her life. What a horrible movie.I love Tim Curry more then life itself, but not in this movie. He dosen't belong here at all.There are two very short scenes worth watching and Adam Ant is in both of them.If I could cut those scenes out to watch and throw the rest away I would."
3,Bad grammar in a good grammar book,"The author did not have an adequate grasp of the present perfect and the past perfect in the 1995 edition and still does not have it in this 2005 edition. Many of the incorrect examples used in '95 reappear in the updated version, e.g, ""I'll telephone you after I've seen Jake"" and ""After I had finished school, I went to America"". I should give it one star to get the attention of those who need to know that they should disregard most of what they see relating to these two tenses."
1,Where's my book?,"HI,I did buy my book on May 6th. We are on July 4th and I haven't seen my book yet.I would thank for some information.Murilo F Cabral"
4,invaluable reference work,"The Swan is the new 'bible' for language teachers. It is an invaluable reference work for all language teachers, especially TEFL, ESOL CELTA."
4,A very good grammar guide,"It's a must for CELTA students, helps you with the lesson plans and assignments. I recommend it. It came earlier than I expected, as it was shipped to Brazil."
5,Excelente libro!,"Este es un libro sin desperdicio. Yo lo uso frecuentemente para consultar dudas, repasar alguna estructura gramatical, o simplemente para ver si encuentro algo nuevo que aprender.. y resulta que cada vez que lo abro me cuesta volverlo a cerrar. Siempre encuentro alguna información valiosa, con buenos y variados ejemplos que facilitan la comprensión de los temas tratados. Simplemente, este libro se ha vuelto una herramienta indispensable para consultar dudas y mejorar mi inglés. Altamente recomendable!"
5,Excellent source of reference,"I am not a native English speaker, and so I admit the book is a little bit advance in some level. However, it reminds me of lots of common mistake I made and how to correct it. It is a big book and not easy to read through. It is not very easy to pinpoint a particular page to read for some of my questions. Yet, I didn't regret buying it!"
4,Not as comprehensive as I would have liked...,"Partly because of its size and partly because of some rave reviews, I expected more. Several entries regarding points of grammar and punctuation which I sought were not there. Some more obscure concepts were dealt with, while more common ones were not."
4,helped my aching back...,"I have a couple of bulging discs in my lower back and as long as I follow the lower back routine, it always makes my back feel better.it has lower back routine, neck routine and one for strengthening and flexibility for the lower back. I have only done the lower back routine and part of the strengthening & flexibility routine. the only shortcoming on this DVD is there is no verbal instruction for each pose."
5,"Reliable C, with Data Structures","This book, copyright 1985, reveals the hidden underbelly of the C language -- the Standard Library .H files, why they are there, what they are for, and how to use them reliably. It does this so the reader can know what functions are already in the standard library, so the reader doesn't have to recreate them.The book's central theme is Reliablity -- ""No Suprises"". To reach this goal it covers all the side effects different C useage has -- and presents a set of rules to standardize on reliable use of C.I wish I'd found this book 15 years or so. It answers those irritating questions like ""Okay, how SHOULD I write a C macro so it's SAFE?"". Buy any beginning C language book, but this one is highly recommended as THE second C book you should own."
5,"With Motown , not instead of","Along with Motown, Stax was home to the legends of soul. Sure the sets get weaker with volumes 2 and 3 , but how could you own one without the others. Even some of the worst tracks from Stax are 90 % better than what was played on the radio at the time."
5,Complete R&B Compendium in a Cube,"What a fantastic gem!Though most could be satisfied -- and well served -- with the STAX 50th Anniversary Collection, this one is for the collector or completist music fan. From its rather doo wop beginnings to its blues, soul and funk stride of the '60s, this collection lays out an important part of American pop music history allowing you to hear R&B; evolution step by step. And it's a great trip.Sure not every single release was a classic, but this box remains superior to most by the shear number of songs and, it should be mentioned, the quality of the remastering as well. What should also be noted is how this collection was once an large, album-shaped box priced at over $100. Now, it is presented in a cd-sized cube (much easier to put on the shelf) with an unquestionable bargain price around $60-$70."
1,Claiborne,My son loves this colgne and every year i get o line and order however this year it was so hard to find and so expensive. When i did order this it did not get here by christmas and it was so small i just laughed. If i had realized how small it was i would have never bought this
5,Great product!,I just started using this product about a year ago. I bought it from a spa and paid almost double at that time. I admit I haven't tried all the other products on the market but this cream really absorbs nicely. It leaves your face feeling soft and moisturized without feeling greasy. I wish it had a sunblock in it but I do love the cream itself.
3,it's okay!!!,i put this on 20 minutes after my TNS complex recovery serum at bedtime. it feels good. i don't know if i'll reorder though.
1,Not Good,"The product was discolored, clumped, had an odor to it, and only had about 1/4 of the product in it. I did send it back and got my money back with no problem."
1,unresolved customer service issues,"Our shipment was not received. Although we e-mailed the merchant several times, we never got a replacement or a credit for the skin medica items ordered. Several months later we are still trying to get the items resend or refunded"
4,"Great product, but is it worth the money?","I bought this product after having a dermabrasion treatment, I was told that it would help my skin create its own moisture. I have found that a little goes a LONG way with this cream, and the relatively small amount has lasted me almost four months. I also really like the scent.However, the lotion does not contain sunscreen, so I have to use a separate product. It also isn't the easiest to find, causing me to order it.I tend to agree that it isn't a miracle cream and is probably a little pricier than I can afford at this time. As much as I like it, once this pack is used up, I will probably go back to ROC antiaging moisturizer with SPF 30.But I will always keep it on my wishlist, in case someone wants to spoil me!"
4,skin medica dermal repair,it goes on smooth & my skin eats it up. People say how great my skin looks since I have been using it.
3,Used to Think this was Miracle Cream...,"This is the second time I have bought this face cream. The first time, I loved it and thought it was a miracle. The second time, I am starting to wonder why I am paying $80+ for face cream... I just don't think I notice that much of a difference between creams that are less expensive. Will not do it again. Its a great cream... I just don't think it justifies the price."
5,Silvestri has bettered Goldsmith,"I must say............I had mixed feelings about Alan Silvestri doing the score, because Goldsmith did such a good job. But I'm extremely glad that he wrote the score. I love Goldsmith's music, but I believe that Silvestri wrote a much better score for this than Goldsmith. The hero themes sound something like John Williams would write. Overall this is one of my favorite scores. Silvestri did a great job with this score. And this is a cd you should definately buy."
4,conglomerate fantasy,"Take a smattering of ""The Ten Commandments"", with its sweeping, yet elderly cheesy anthem, a bit of ""KIng Solomon's Mines"", no doubt borrowed by virtue of Goldsmith's work, the very same composer who scored the first installment of this erstwhile and now present franchise, and a dash of Silvestri's own drumwork, notably taken from ""Judge Dredd"" and ""Predator"", and you'll have this rousing, if nostalgia-emitting work that joins majesty and heroism together. A good buy and one of Silvestri's best!"
4,Silvestri's Mummy,"I was surprised to find out that Alan Silvestri took over the composition chores for this sequel because I thought Jerry Goldsmith did a very good job in his score for ""The Mummy"". However, Silvestri wrote a very impressive score for ""The Mummy Returns"", full of action and noteworthy moments.The action music on this CD is spectacular, and the heroic theme is far better than Goldsmith's, especially in 'Evy Kidnapped' and 'My First Bus Ride'. The final cue 'The Mummy Returns' is remarkable. The Egyptian motif is quite good, but it lacks the mysticism that Goldsmith conveyed in the original. Also, I have to say that the song 'Forever May Not Be Long Enough', performed by Live, seems out of place on this CD.It's too bad that the music for the final battle is not included in here, but the seventy minutes of this CD make up for a good listen because Silvestri did a good job in this sequel."
2,Both movies...meh...,"I wanted to see Enemy at the Gate again and, for the price, got Defiance too. ""Enemy"" was okay...the cinematography was very good but I get frustrated when film makers feel obligated to weave in a love story into a war film. I just watched ""Defiance"" today and was very disappointed. The cast was very promising but again I found the story a bit too contrived (though, granted based on true events). I'll doubtfully watch either again."
5,"Awesome, Awesome","These two films are great. The fact that they are cheap and in a Blu ray double pack is even more awesome.Defiance is a very different type of war movie. It is like a cross between Band of Brothers during the siege of Bastogne and Shindler's List. It presents a much different view of the war than the typical war dramas.Enemy at the gates is the only major (American released) film I know of to focus on the Russians in WW 2. Specifically it focuses on the battle of Stalingrad. Much of the story is embellished to create a better movie and to ad in Romance, etc but this is one of the greatest war films made in the past quarter century."
4,"Handy, practical, sensible.","This slim volume can make a real difference for you and your child. It's hard enough to remember the names of all the child's doctors, much less each illness, injury, vaccination (and booster), and antibiotic. The author has created a sturdy volume to hold all -- and only -- the crucial medical information about the child.The sturdy record book is made to last a lifetime. This is not a book for just baby records, though, but will follow your child from birth into adulthood.I highly recommend this book for new parents, and in fact any parent who wants help organizing and maintaining their child's medical record."
2,Good Idea - Poorly Executed,"This book tries to provide a place to keep all your records, but it's omissions and inconsistent layout make it unacceptable for me. The page entitled ""Birth of Child"" doesn't even have a place for the birth weight, length or head circumference (""Progress Reports"" for that information starts at 2 weeks). Teething and Dental Records are completely ignored; instead, you get 20 of the 72 pages relating to Medicine and Dosage (allowing 108 enties)! I'd rather spend my money (about 1/4 the cost of this book) on the ""American Academy of Pediatrics Child Health Record""; which despite its many omissions, packs much more into its 24 pages, (such as: birth details, developmental landmarks, growth charts and recommendations for vacinations and dental records)."
5,Don't leave town without it,"Ths book has come in handy numerous times, most recently on a trip out of state. The doctor was pleased, and impressed, when we were able to give the relevant history (medications, dosages, results) on the spot. We've found this to be the single best baby gift we received, and we've given copies to new mothers many times since, always with great success.This book contains the information you need year to year. Your child and the pediatrician will thank you for getting, and using, this durable book."
5,Discover music where you might not expect to find it,"Nashville, Austin, Spartanburg? After reading this book, that sentence might not look so strange. It is truly amazing how many great musicians this small city has produced. The writing is lively and informed. The chapter on Walter Hyatt is worth the price of the book alone."
4,Good Start but More is Needed,"I think the main problem I had with this book was it was so intriguing and in the end it just didn't deliver in the way that other of Ms. Wilkins' books have, namelyThe Autumn CastleI wish there had been more to the story and the relationships. It really should be a trilogy to give us more of the historical parts as well as the modern ones. This novel was obviously well researched, so idealy it would be nice to have more of a story."
2,Not as good as the audio sample,"This album starts out pleasantly enough, much like the online audio sample which I found to be similar to a small collection of actual wind chimes in a light breeze. After the first couple of minutes, though, the recording becomes somewhat choppy and contrived, with occasional ""gongs"" that are jarring and carry considerable sound distortion. On the upside, this album is all chimes, and chimes without music or other sounds such as babbling brooks, rain, etc. are hard to find. While I don't hate it, it does make me want to splice the good parts together and discard the 70% percent or so where the chimes are clearly being played (and rather poorly) by human hands rather than by the wind. If you must have it, I suggest downloading the mp3 version for less than a third of the price of this surprisingly pricey CD."
5,LOVE THIS!!!,I love this CD. I have wind chimes and love hearing them. Having this CD is a great background when I'm doing stuff around the house. The people downstairs must think I have a million wind chimes.
5,New Chill Music,"Chime is the latest release from the Ball of Waxx label, and it's a mellow collection of electronica, featuring some of my faves like Eastern Sun, John Kelley, Muffle, and Seed... and some new (to me)artists. My favorite tracks are ""Fireflies"" by Nalepa and ""What Is"" by Eastern Sun. A complex album of chill music... very cool and well planned compilation. A great addition to any music library."
3,OK for the price.,"For the most part, this isn't bad. Sometimes the chimes just don't sound natural to me, as though they are being tapped or swatted at rather than blowing in a breeze, and the lower tones sound just weird, like some dissonant banging on an electric piano. At times the CD sounds like a recording of a broken music box. There are long stretches where it sounds great, but then they are disrupted when fake-sounding lower tones invade. For that reason I did not find this CD all that useful for meditation or relaxation."
5,It is like you are there,"What a great read! It reads like a first hand report and hence you feel as if you are there. Anyone who has an interest in that part of the world, and all that is going on there, should read it. Powerful and enlightening."
5,A book you can't put down!,"Wow! I have to say it again, Wow! We all remember everything about that dreadful day on 9/11, how the perfect blue sky turned cloudy with black smoke and the unknown turned to the unbelieveable. Life would never be the same again, for any of us. This book takes you on one man's journey as a husband, father and Marine Corp Colonel as his performs his duties to the United States of America to root out those responsible for that horrific day. The book is rivoting, emotional and intense. Once you start reading it, you can't stop until you reach the last page!"
3,Thieves of Baghdad review,"Book is a quick read, staccato style of writing. Author Col Bogdanos is straightforward and non-critical as he describes the way he recovered the treasures,cash and gold from Iraq. One can't help but wonder if the recovery of the treasures, like that of Iraq itself, will be sustained or just fall again when the animals take control of the zoo."
2,"Read the first chapter, then quit.","The first chapter is a teaser to get you to read the rest of the book. One expects to find out who the culprits were and the evidence showing this, but one will be disappointed. The book is really an autobiography, concentrating on Bogdanos's time in Afghanistan and Iraq. One learns a lot about process, how wonderful certain people were, his philosophy, his love of family and what he thinks of people in the art world. One does not learn who the thieves were, even though enough evidence from the crime scenes would appear to have been collected (but was it?).The book appears to have been written to correct much completely incorrect publicity that appeared in the press after the looting of the Iraqi museum. I am unable to tell how much of this is valid and how much is deliberate spin.I did not enjoy his telling me how wonderful all the American military people were, but I suppose that is to be expected of an American.Read the first chapter, and then quit."
1,Going Downhill FAST,"I don't know what happened to the quality of videos at Living Arts. The pilates series is really way below standard-- compared to the yoga videos. I have the beginning mat series with Ana and I returned both of them because of the inadequate instruction and low quality production. READ THE REVIEWS for these other videos before buying this one! Don't be fooled like me. Some other pilates videos I would recommend are Denise Austin's Pilates for Every Body, Suzanne Deason's pilates for weight loss (ignore the title, it is more challenging and complete then the ones by Ana-- and gives me some hope for Living Arts). Honestly speaking though to get a total body workout that brings together mind and body stick with yoga-- it's as good as it gets. Pilates is good if you use the machines, on the mat it basically touches on portions of what yoga covers more completely."
4,Easy read,It was an easy read and kept you interested from beginning to end. It got me interested in reading more from this author.
4,Enjoyable,"A good read overall. Drags a bit in the middle, but kept me entertained. I would recommend for historical romance fans."
5,riveting,"This is a very compelling book. The story grabbed my attention from the very beginning and kept a fast pace all over the book. The plot is complex and rich of twists and turns, it always remains very well developed and consistent, though. The characters are well shaped and pictured with several shades that make their personalities very vivid and likely."
1,Warning: Of Noble Birth contains sexual content,Beware: I purchased this book because someone told me that the author is a christian. I started reading the book and found it quite interesting...that is until the subject turned to sex. I DO NOT read books filled with sexual content. I ended up deleting the book without finishing it.
5,Swashbuckling Adventure!!,"""Of Noble Birth"" was a story I picked up for FREE on the Kindle. Totally worth free, but I would have paid for it too. I have some of Brenda Novak's other novels, and for the most part, she develops her characters well. Considering this was her first novel, it is impressive. There are moments of slight disbelief, where you have to suspend your modern-day skepticism. But overall, very engaging novel. I do have a thing for stories where bad-boy-turns-good-for-love-of-a-woman (gives the rest of us hope!). And Alexandra only has a moment or so of forgiveable stupidity, but understandable, given her predicament. Enjoyable read! I like the 1999 version of the cover better too."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought this book was quite entertaining. I liked that the male hero was not a perfect specimen, and yet was successful and appealing. The heroine was alright. The plot was a bit all over the place, but that kept me on my toes a bit. Overall grade: B+"
2,Dull as dishwater,"I was really disappointed with this book. What first lured me to it was the glowing reviews given by others, but unfortunately, the book couldn't live up to expectations. I found the characters irritating! The ""hero""'s love for the heroine stemmed more from his lust rather than any stronger emotion. Thus, there was no basis for true love. All in all, this novel lacks the ability to entrall readers, and the ""throw everything at us poor readers"" method of plotting drove me crazy. Oh well. Maybe it was just me."
5,Adventure and romance!,"Wonderful historical detail, a wounded hero and heroine that made my heart ache, lots of action and adventure. I loved this book!"
3,So-so,"First of all, I must mention that I only read this book because it was a free Kindle selection. That being said, this book leaves much to be desired. First of all, this is most decidedly not a romance. The characters' relationship in this story is secondary to the adventure, and the relationship isn't even a great one. Secondly, the book could use some editing with a machete - it was far too long. I'm giving it three stars instead of one or two because the prose itself was good, and the story was entertaining and obviously well-researched."
2,"Well, maybe 2 and a half stars.","Detail = excellent . . . Characters = disappointing . . . Prose = so so . . . Plot = overdone . . . Love scenes = were there any? Did I miss them?The love story between Nathaniel and Alexandra got lost in the midst of all the plot. So many things happened to these two that it was almost ridiculous. A very dark and depressing book. I didn't leave with a feeling that these two were meant for each other, that they _had_ to be together. This one goes to the UBS."
2,didn't finish........possible spoilers,"I'm VERY glad this book was free on my Kindle. I only made it 38% through. I'm not sure where incest is an okay thing to over look, but it grossed me out. I know Alexandra isn't ACTUALLY Nathanial's sister, but for the love of God, he doesn't know that!"
2,Bland and Uninteresting,"I read this book trying to keep an open mind. However, there was just never a point where I was really engaged in the book and I only finished it because I had nothing better to do. I was also disgusted that the hero didn't seem to have any qualms about having sexual thoughts about his ""sister."" Not one I would recommend."
5,Of Noble Birth,"As usual I read the other reviews, particularly the bad ones, as you know. How can you review a book if you don't read it all the way through, in my world you can't and don't deserve to slam a piece of literature. Particularly in this case ! This is a thoughtfully researched piece as it accurately describes the life and times of the characters, places, manners, habits the whole gamut of life that to be perfectly honest wasn't very nice. That was why people came to America folks ! It's a strange thing but I guess that some of the people that reviewed this thought that there should have been more blatant sex or the sex wasn't to their taste or whatever. Giving peoples twisted thoughts instead of minutiae detailed description of bedroom sex, is a change of scene and makes this a little different from the usual cannon fodder that you get in historical romances. Good on you Ms. Novak I'll give it 4.95 Stars and come back for more."
4,A Decent Read,"I enjoyed the book but I got kind of caught up in the arm thing. I kept imagining what it'd be like as he was doing things and it drew me away from the story. Despite that, I did finish the book and I was glad I did."
3,3 1/2 STARS,I enjoyed this far fetched plot because it was well written and a fun read. It was a bit long and could have been shortened without detracting from the plot. But I enjoyed the characters and the adventurous escapades.
1,Way too dark for my taste,And convoluted. The over-kill in the story made me put the book down - how many things can yuo expect to happen to two people? Enough already.
3,Great season. But.....,Season was great. But I received the set damaged the inside disc holders were cracked and all the disc are now lose in the case. Luckily the discs work so far and I didn't see and damage to them.
5,Change can be painful,"The world of television is evolving into something else, a merge between tv and computer and unfortunately some shows will be hurt in the process. Will Chuck be one of those shows?! I am afraid it might... The ""nerd"" demographic it appeals to is the most likely to watch the show on their computers and not tv, this is not good for advertising dollars; this coupled with their expensive effects may be their undoing... But it's not all sad, much like some of the bands chuck features, they are leading the way for the future! Lets just hope their catalog is fleshed out in the the process!"
5,It's Chuck!,"If you love Chuck, you have to see this season. Fun as ever. Also so easy to watch on Tivo via Amazon."
4,One of the best shows no one is watching,"Not sure why people would rather watch endless hours of American Idol and Dancing with the Stars when they could be watching a scripted show that is whitty and fun with a lot of appealing good looking actors and actresses.I had seen the Pilot when it first aired and thought it was ok but I decided to get the first season and watch it and fell in love with it. The only part of the show that is hit or miss are the ""Buy More"" scenes but the spy, comedy and romance stuff is top notch.The second season does not flounder and stays up there in quality.Give it a chance. You may be surprised."
3,Would be much better with closed captions,"Chuck is a likeable enough hero and a likeable enough series. And while I love NBC giving this premiere episode up for free, I'd be a lot happier if my wife, who's deaf, could have enjoyed it, too. At this point, there's no reason -- none at all -- that online players can't include the closed caption feed, which is part of every new television broadcast. There are anywhere from 30 to 50 million people in the country with hearing loss, plus another 30 million people who use captions occasionally (those learning English, those watching at work, or in noisy environments). I have a big problem with Amazon's decision not to bother to include captions. It's just a case of laziness on management's point. And I object."
1,Great show. Poor DVD quality,"Chuck: The Complete Second SeasonLike other reviewers, I can't play the Special Features on the last disc. I tried on many DVD players."
3,Sad,"I love this show, it is hilarious and fun. I'm not very happy with my DVDs however. None of the special features on the last two disks work. I've tried three different players without success. When I select play there is garbled sound, sometime garbled picture or sometimes it never changes from the menu. Aside from the last two disks, all the episodes and other disk's special features play just fine."
5,Everything you could want in a show.,"Chuck seriously has everything you could want in a show: Comedy, Action, Romance, Suspense. All the good stuff all in one place. I faithfully watch Chuck every Monday Night. I'm so glad NBC kept this around for season 3, they did something right! The more I watch the show, the more I like each of it's characters."
3,Great show poor BR product,"I love Chuck, none of my gripes are with the show, they are with whomever authored the BlueRay version of the discs. The Menus are poor. You can't select the episode you want to watch from the main menu, you have to use the pop-up. The menu UI is painful to look at. And finally the quality of the image is very grainy on BlueRay. The grainyness might be a fact-of-life due to how a scene was shot, but there are no excuses for the atrocious menus."
2,NOT IN 3-D,"Just to give you a warning so you don't waste your three bucks wanting to see 3-D in HD. Despite what it says in the description, this IS NOT IN 3-D."
2,Not actually 3D!,"Be warned that this is not actually a 3D version of this episode! Hulu has two versions and you can choose, but Amazon doesn't have the 3D version."
5,Chuck Season 2... worth the buy :),"I pre-ordered this new season last week and got it today, a day before it's release. :D I absolutely love this show, starting from season 1. The season 2 dvd set comes with 2 3-D glasses for a special episode. If you loved the first season on dvd, and are looking for a great buy, then this is your best shot!"
3,"Chuck, Season 2","Series isgreat, but the extras on the last disc didn't work. So I am not sure about the rest of the DVD"
5,Chuck is awesome!,"I love this show, and it's consistently great throughout. Each season builds on the last while keeping the heart that is a key part of the action-adventure-nerd reference equation."
3,It works,The second season is a good one. All discs are in good shape but they are freezing and skipping around a little bit. So if you don't mind that then there's no problems
5,Love it!,"This is such a fun show, this episode included. Adam Baldwin does such a good job as Casey : )"
4,"Chuck is awesome, but this thing needs more extras","What can i say? if you are a chuck fan, you have to buy this disc, there also another version that comes with 3d glasses and a 3d episode, but it costs more and i think you can get it only from warner bros...if you dont know chuck the series, i would recommend you to go to hulu or nbc and watch some episodes there, and then if you like it, get the dvds or blurays...the only thing i wish i could add tho the dvds/blurays is more extras, i really wish it had more extras, and maybe better picture quality, but i guess thats the way the shot the series (not so good digital camaras?) anyways, enjoy!"
2,Beware Amazon buyers!!,"I am excited to start watching this season of ""Chuck"". I just wish I hadn't pre-ordered it from Amazon. The set I received was not the special edition with the 3-D episode and glasses. Unfortunately, I didn't know that until after I opened it. If you want the 3-D, buy it elsewhere. Normally I would not post a review until after watching it first, because I hate it when people do that, but this is just meant as a heads up."
3,Missing 3D version of show,"I love Chuck and was so happy to see that they finally released the Second Season - BUT I was really disappointed that even with the pre-order I did not get the ""Limited Edition"" version of the DVDS that included the 3D episode and glasses. Oh well....be aware of this when ordering."
3,Like the series but poor encoding,"I like Chuck and enjoyed the session, but the quality of the DVD encoding is really poor. They have really crammed the episodes onto the disc with the result that the quality is lacking."
3,a shame...,"its a shame that they do not have the episode of chuck versus the third dimension in 3d any more. when it first came out it was in 3d, but the later releases of the product are not. still a fantastic buy if you want a great show."
5,"Chuck is a great ""almost all ages show""","Chuck is a guy that we can all relate to. My grandparents who are seventy love this show, as do my brothers who are in their mid twenties, and my nephew who is 11.Granted, there are a few ""sexual"" scenes and a lot of Agent Sarah wearing her underwear, for the most part it's kept to a minimum, and the show is AWESOME.There are a ton of main characters to relate to, and it's about a nerd who's life is turned upside down. There's real life issues, romance, action and everything inbetween, and it ties together SO WELL.Men enjoy this show, escpecially the action, and women love it too, it's a great couples show.Not too unrealistic, but just enough scifi to make it interesting. I love it, I know you will too. Start from Season One for sure, and keep watching.It's AMAZING."
2,Not thrilled with the storyline,"The ""Buy More"" (since I doubt Best Buy would give them permission to use their name) doubles as a command center for Chuck and his team's ""spy activity"", that of course, nobody can know about.The many things about this show that I don't like:1) There's more emphasis on the attractiveness of Sarah Walker, than on the missions.2) The fact that Sarah Walker's sex appeal is what brings 90% of the viewers back to the show. Though, I have to give her credit for flawlessly shedding her foreign accent to play this role.3) The ""Power Rangers theme"" that I described earlier, is getting old.4) In a future season (I forget which one), Chuck has the chance to 'lose the intersect' and go back to having a normal life. To boost ratings and keep people interested, the network decided to keep him going; big mistake."
2,Diasppointment,"I was really disappointed. First off, the font used is terrible; it makes distinguishing sections difficult. The discussion on grammar is pretty tedious and it is real easy to lose interest in it as I did. It should have, considering the high price, come with a CD for the student to be able to practice correct pronunciation.This book is poor value and one would be better off with the Teach Yourself Serbian series by Norris/Ribnikar."
5,The iClick is off da heezie fo sheezie,The iClick is the best camera i have used yet. It's design is very cool and I enjoy the 30 second videos you can mnake. It is very enjoyable and I take it Everyewhere. Also easy to use.
1,"Run away, don't walk!","The main problem with all the 5 star reviews of this ""camera"" are that they all sound like some marketing wonk wrote them. And some of them for this and the other iClick where written by someone named McGowan. Funny, the camera is made by McGowan Technologies. Wonder if there is a connection.The other problem is that this hunk of junk makes very bad pictures in anything but direct sunlight, the flash is useless, and there is *no* preview screen even though one is implied by the promo pics. I took 50 or so pics, most of which where ""junk"", and ended up giving this toy camera to my next door neighbor's 6-year-old son to play with.Honestly, if you don't have a lot to spend on a digital camera, at least go with a name brand product that has at least some percentage of chance producing half decent pics. The iClick aint it!"
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this camera for my 8 year old daughter. I thought I was getting an easy to use, entry level digital camera. What I actually got was a piece of junk.The instructions were difficult to understand, the software would not install properly, and the camera itself sometimes didn't work.I am sending it back [...] for a refund.Bottom line: DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!"
5,Worth a Thousand Words,"This product is easy to use and dollar for dollar, the best digital camera on the market. You cannot go wrong!"
1,WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!,"I wouldn't use this camera if you gave me money. Sad to say, my cousin bought this piece of crap on ebay for $15 (overpriced for me), the picture quality is horrible. This camera was made in sweatshop somewhere in China. Lots of these so called satisfied customers is the product of the salesman for Iclick. One word CRAP."
4,Travel Camera,"I took this camera with me on a vacation to Jamica. The camera was extremely easy to use and it fit in my beach bag. The pictures were clear and easy to e-mail. We had a lot of fun in our hotel room connecting it to the TV and watching a slide show of the days events. The only downside is that it doesn't have an LCD display to see your pictures after you take them. But at the price, it is well worth it. The and design and size of the iClick are really cool."
1,another piece of worthless junk,"The instructions are cryptic. The controls are tedious to use. The results are marginal at best. Definitely going to return this [weak item], and get a better brand.Remember, you get what you pay for."
1,Replacing the Strap,"Please note that if you want to replace the strap on this watch, you have to SEND the entire watch into the parts replacement desk by mail with no guaranteed date of return (in Canada). Tommy Hilfiger nor their service desk will tell you the specs or brand name of the strap so that you can buy the same one in your city. In fact, Tommy Hilfiger will not help whatsoever except to refer you to the service desk. I for one am not paying to ship my watch away when I only have the one."
5,Five Young Men are the best group to come!,Also what's good about thid cd is that it's gospel and they are singing about god. Their sound is different from all these other young groups that sound all the same and sing tired love songs.You don't have to listen to gospel to get this because once you hear it you'll like it.
5,Wish i could see it again....,"Hi, I saw this movie 3 times when i was living for a while in the states, that was one among other things that got me really interested in Native Americans... Now i live in Sweden, i cant find any release of it in our format (PAL) So if u have the chance to see it DO IT !!!! Bye bye"
2,Pore script,"The acting is well performed. Too bad the script and direction are so sophmoric. I had a hard time with this film. Especially with such great film as ""Smoke Signals"" in current release."
3,Nicky slowing down.,This is an inconsistent average album compared to her three better previous solo albums and to stevie nicks standards. One can quite tell her creativity was declining with each new release which was only rectified with the release of Trouble in shangri la. Stevie does present some good songs. Unfortunatley the arrangments are quite middle of the road and bland.
5,One of Stevie's greatest!,"I got this cd for Christmas and I love every song! My favorite song is ""Cry Wolf"", I don't understand why it's not on Enchanted. I think it is one of her greatest songs ever! And some people said that WHOLE LOTTA TROUBLE wasn't a good song! Don't listen to them. Buy it! Every Stevie cd is worth buying!"
5,.....A Masterpiece,"What can I say about ""The Other Side of The Mirror"" ""Great Concept"" ""Great music"" ""Great Artist"""
3,WORTHY EFFORT,"Like every Stevie album, some good cuts, some fair cuts. Standouts include: ""Long long way to go"" (Stevie's vocals are back in good form on that one!), ""Rooms on fire"", ""Whole lotta trouble""(Great HORNS!), and ""2 kinds of love"" (one of her prettier songs). Couple cuts could have been eliminated (""Ghosts"", ""I miss someone""), otherwise very enjoyable."
5,Best Stevie Album Ever!,"This is by far my favorite Stevie Nicks album. The songs Rooms on Fire, Cry Wolf and Juliet are phenomenal and can be listened to repeatedly."
3,The Other Side Of The Mirror,"The sucess of her last three albums should have told Stevie something. When she writes her own material personally the albums work. However this time very few of the tracks are completely written by Stevie and the album suffers. Still while it isn't a great album , the tracks are good enough to warrant a listen. The catchy ""Rooms On Fire"" (The album's lead single) is a good tune that I have listened to many times. The romantic duet ""Two Kinds of Love"" (Recorded with Bruce Hornsby) is another strong effort as are ""Cry Wolf"" and ""Fire Burning"". Stevie has had a lot of sucess but unfortuantely this album signaled a decline in popularity for her which would last for almost a decade. Best song on the album: Rooms On Fire"
5,excellent customer service,"The lamp is more than beautiful and the customer service is ""A"" NUMBER ONE. We put it together and realized the screw holes were not aligned and my husband pulled it apart to fix and the wires pulled apart. We did what it said not to do and the gorgeous lamp was broke. When I let customer service know what we did they didn't care that it was our fault and immediately offered to send another or give us a refund. We want the lamp for sure but will be very careful to not pull the wires out."
4,best book in minerology!,"as a student i had to do lot of study on mineralogy and had trouble all along. bus since i stumbled along this book i enjoy mineralogy very much, and my understandig of this subject hase increased a million timen. truly a treasure!!!"
5,They Keep Getting Better,"For those of you who do not know, The Elders are an Irish ""rock"" band out of Kansas City. I live in Omaha, NE and have been lucky enough to catch them live a few times at the wonderful Dubliner Pub. This is The Elders' third CD, following the self-titled debut and Pass It On Down. While all 3 CDs are gems, it is evident that their musical style and direction is getting better with each album. A great CD to hold me over between live shows!"
4,Good,This is a pretty good digital CD if your in to the latin oldies you will like this it has some new and old songs on it.
4,nice figure,"I really like fate/stay night, and rin is one of my favorite characters in the series. This figure came and its the 3rd rin figure i have bought, and its the best so far, the detail is nice and the figure looks like rin down to the face.Bome did a good job and its the first figure i have bought from this line. im satisfied with it. Note: the only thing that i dont care for with the figure is that the dagger is glued into her hand and cannot be removed without messing up the paint job."
3,Henry Plummer A Novel,"This story is set in the most exciting time in the history of the west. Citizens of the gold mine towns in Montana were totally at the mercy of a band of road agents lead by Henry Plummer. Plummer was also the elected sheriff of the territory. Robbery and murder were common endings for men carrying fortunes. The violence ended when the Vigilance Committee rose up and hanged thirty outlaws in less than a month. The author inserts ficitonal characters into this real setting to make his story more marketable. He missed the mark with these characters. Written in the style of the early 20th century the prose is stilted and the characters a bit thin. It is a good story. The foreward, including the authors correspondece with C.M.Russel, makes this a worthwhile read for western history aficionado."
1,Old myths and fictions served up again,"As documented extensively by Mather and Boswell in their ground breaking history, HANGING THE SHERIFF, A BIOGRAPHY OF HENRY PLUMMER, there simply was no organized gang, and therefore Henry Plummer was not the leader of a gang. Instead he was a hard working law man who had to be gotten out of the way for the new men from the east to take over. This book is a simple rehash of the tired old myths and fictions from Dimsdale and Langford."
3,Chris Rocks The Spot (3.5 Stars),"Chris Rock is hilarious. There's no other way to say it. On this 1991 release, recorded in an Atlanta night club, Chris Rock tackled all kinds of topics that left me holding my sides when it was all over. Though this isn't his funniest album, it's definitely not his worst. There are times where Chris does manage to fall flat. Tracks like ""The Rib Man"" and ""Weaves / Color Contacts"" could have been left off the album. And there are times where the volume goes up and down due to technical errors. But those are minor problems. Overall, the album is hilarious. If you haven't heard this album, give it a try. You'll love it."
2,Not up to his usual level,"This CD was a disappointment in many ways. First, the material was just not as funny as his later stuff. Aside from his material about Marion Barry, the jokes were sustandard. Secondly, the mixing on this album was terrible and I had to turn the volume way up on my stereo so I could make out what exactly Rock was saying. Rock was also mumbling a lot, which made it even harder to understand him. He seemed to lack the confidence that he displays on his later albums. If you are a die-hard Chris Rock fan, the get this. Otherwise, just stick to his later stuff."
3,Read it and leave it.,"This is one of those books you take on vacation (or somewhere) and you're not upset if it gets lost. It's not bad, just ""run of the mill"". I've read this same story before- shy (but pretty) heroine and the man she loves from afar. The book got boring about half way through, I put it down, picked it up a week later and finished it. ""That's all folks""."
3,sadly lacking in content,"In general a very good selection of songs from the late 50's and early 60's, giving great feeling and representing the period well, though overshadowed by the apparent lack of coverage of the film = ten tracks in all from the British CD version. Many of the Italian sang tracks having been excluded along with the sid vicious redition of Frank Sinatra's 'My way'. Every track trasports you back to the film and visions of Liota's/De niro's/Pesci's expressions in the relevant scenes. To sum up, Quality music with passion and feeling, lacking in coverage from film. Such a good Film should have an equally good soundtrack !!!!"
1,whew,I never used to read reviews until I started looking at Movie Soundtracks....Thank God I read this one. There were 4 songs I really wanted and not 1 of them is on the CD.
2,To answer the question below...,"To answer the question below, the two songs played during the helicopter paranoia scene are George Harrison's What Is Life, and Harry Nilsson's Jump Into the Fire. Both excellent songs, both excluded from the soundtrack."
3,Just the tip of the ice berg...,"So many songs are missing from the soundtrack. I was only disappointed that they didn't have 'The Bells Of St. Mary' by The Drifters which is played during the execution of Samuel L. Jackson's character. If that was there I would have had no complaint. However, although there are many other songs missing alot of the strongest tracks are on the soundtrack enough to make you remember all you favourite scenes of this classic gangster epic."
1,I really wanted this soundtrack BUT....,the songs from the movie which hooked me (Harry Nilsson - Jump into the Fire; and songs by the Stones and Beatles) were conspicuously absent.Such a disappointment!What were they thinking?
1,Don't Buy!,"This soundtrack sucks! The songs in the movie were great but you only get a third of them on this CD. For fans of the movie, this is a total waste of money."
3,The Lyrics for BOB Regarding his Question,"I saw your question about the scene I think you are asking about. One part has ""You can climb a mountain"" it is by Harry Nilsson. The other is by the""Stones"" I'm a Monkey"" I found this on http://www.webfitz.com If you remeber some words and enter them there are several sites that help.I agree what a rip off that Mertin Scorsese didn't do a complete volume of them.Hope I helped.Belledajour"
3,goodfellas the soundtrack,"this soundtrack is dissapointing as it has the potential to be possibly one of the greatest of all time.it has however failed in this regard .this album should somehow mirror the greats such as""once upon a time in america"" or ""forrest gump"".in the movie we are treated to some of the greatest songs from the early fifties to the mid eighties.in my opinion this again has the potential to be the greatest but lanquishes in the mediocre"
3,Good but not comprehensive,"As we all know by this point, yes, the movie was great. The music in the film definitely help to contribute positively to the entire work, however, not all the songs are featured on the soundtrack. This item should be rereleased with ALL of the songs from the movie, for maximum benefit."
2,Answer To Johns Question,Hey JohnThe song played when Henry is introducing all the mobsters at the bar is Il Cielo in una Stanza(This World We Live In)by MinaHope that helps. I will be writing a full review for this albulmsome time this week.
2,soundtrack also missed a Rolling Stones deep cut,"i cant remember what part of the movie its in but you only hear a small part and theres no lyrics but its ""Memo From Turner"" which is a great song from the The Rolling Stones. in the movie all you hear is a real catchy guitar/instrumental part."
2,Missing all the songs I was looking for,"When i bought this, i was hoping to hear all the great 70's songs i heard during the movie, only to be let down and only hear the older songs i could never get into."
2,Missing some of the best...,I bought this CD looking for some of the songs from the 70s - No stones and no George Harrison. I was disappointed. Not sure what they were thinking!
2,Disappointed,"Two very good songs are not on this album and were in the movie...""Pretend you don't love her"" by Jerry Vale and ""Hearts made of stone"""
3,ok,honest opinion about the product--positive I have been very satified with the purchase and all I have purchased not the one I thought
3,Goodfellas: Music From The Motion Picture,Great Movie but CD is just OK & pales in comparison toA Bronx Tale Sound Track.
2,Goodfellas - A Fraction of the Music From The Motion Picture,"Ok, if you have seen Goodfellas the movie, you will know that it has about 30 fantastic songs in it, and there is only 12 songs on the Soundtrack cd. I would love to see a re-release of the soundtrack with ALL the songs on it."
3,should have been a Double Set,the songs worked so well in the film but you only get a fraction of them.the songs work so well within various scenes but when you get the Soundtrack quite a bit is missed. this is a Pretty Good Soundtrack that would have been even better had all the songs been featured as a Double Disc.
4,Good soundtrack fellas but...,There are many great songs from key scenes missing. George harrisons what is life for example when he being watched by the helicopter is great piece of music editing and should have been included but besides from that very good.
3,"Easy, Cool, Jazz-Pop Make-out Music","These songs are culled from just a couple of recording sessions, alternating on the CD. The earlier half are from two dates in October and November, 1955. The later half are from November, 1964 and May, 1965. There are no recording dates in-between these time periods, although the disc does a good job of switching back and forth between the decade's passage that seperates them.As far as these Verve re-issues of 'for lovers' goes, this is still a fairly decent over-view of Chet Baker doing what Chet Baker did best. The occasional boy-man soft vocals lilting over cool jazz-pop background.Not as original or innovative as other jazz greats, vocal and instrumental, Chet still built up a solid following and reputation at the crest of the avant-garde jazz movement throughout the early 50's and on.If Chet Baker strikes your fancy, this is a good place to start your collection."
4,Best sharkie you can get,"This giant sharkie has adorable mouth, eyes, tail, fins, everything.The flappers are filled with little tiny balls whichgives it a weight and funny textures.It's slick looking will take your mind right away!"
5,Celtic Chieftains,"As the name of the book would suggest, the kings and clans of the Celts, ancient, medieval, and modern, are the primary focus of this book. It first examines the origins and definitions of the Celts, before moving on to a history of both the Ancient Gauls and Galatians, and the more recent Celtic civilizations of the British Isles. It also devotes chapters to famous Celtic rulers like Vercingetorix, Vortigern, Boudica, Cartimandua, King Arthur, and a variety of Irish heroes. Also has a useful appendix on the major Scottish clans."
2,Not very relaxing,"I wasn't very happy with this purchase. The rain was so heavy alot of the time, it sounded like static and other parts had an annoying bird in the background. I would choose another product if it's for relaxation."
4,Thundering rain,"Very nice for background mood music. I used it in the classroom for a book study called Thunder Cake. There was alot of thunder that was fairly frequent, but I would have liked on song with a strong storm with some large crescendos of thunder."
2,"Too much rain, not enough thunder","Was looking for more thunder. Very few thunder claps. The S/N was also very poor, so you have to turn the volume way up to hear it."
1,Get rid of the birds!!,"I should have believed the other reviewers, the bird sounds are HORRIBLE. Which is really a shame because they did a nice job with the thunder and rain. But the birds make me want to pull my brain out after a few tracks. I guess if you LOVE birds chirping in the rain constantly and not really sounding real then this is for you. Otherwise, move on. I'll be donating this to my local library's used book shop with a note of warning on it."
2,"Nice Rainstorm, But Bird Is Too Noisy!","I should have taken the advice of the other reviews. The thunder and rain sounds great, but it is ruined by that annoying little bird! Although I enjoy the sounds of birds, the particular bird here is obnoxious. It repeats the same high pitch sound over and over again and it's very distracting. I would be willing to overlook, if it was only 3 or 5 minutes, but it chirps for the entire 60 minutes! I'm going to search for another CD."
3,Better than most,"The sounds were quite good, but at the start there is some sounds akin to wind, which I did not want. Then the storm arrives and throughout I can hear the sound of a bird cheeping away in the distance! It's not until about half way through that the bird seems to stop...for a while!...and then the good stuff comes with heavy rain, which I liked the most until it fades away. The result its better than most of what I have heard, but I am still not content to stop searching. I mean what in the world do the Hollywood companies use since they seem to use sound effects of thunderstorms and rain in various movies that are so realistic and make me just want to curl up in bed and fall asleep...in the cinema!"
1,Why was only one other person irritated by the yakking bird?,"I ordered this CD based on the wonderful reviews. There was only one reviewer that didn't like it because of the yakking background bird. Other reviewers even contradicted the yakking bird review by stating that there was no annoying background bird noises. They must have received a different CD than the one that was delivered to my house. I tried really hard to block out the yakking bird, but just could not. It wasn't even a pleasant bird sound, just chirp, chirp, chirp, like it was trying to say ""Get away from my nest"". Distracted me so much I threw the CD away. Don't buy this CD if you're expecting to relax. I wish I could give it a negative five stars to balance out the great rating it received from others."
1,Repetitive bird with thunderstorm background,"This CD, (like the bird on it should of) took a major flight into the trash can. I think you know what I mean."
3,Can't beat it for the price,"I like the CD and listen to it often to fall asleep to. Sometimes the bird wakes me up but not enough to keep me awake. I would LOVE this CD if the bird was filtered out. But as is this CD does what I was hoping it would do, help me fall asleep. Someone should record one of these without music in AZ during the monsoon season. We wouldn't hear birds and crikets that can take away from the rain. Get this CD it's worth it."
1,Disappointed,"It's good...except for The Bird. Having grown up in the midwest, not a rain forest, a screeching bird in the background is not something I associate with a ""good old-fashioned thunderstorm"". The screeching reminds me of tricycles that need their squeaky wheels oiled...NOT relaxing. Sigh...back to searching for an authentic thundering rainstorm CD."
4,Great white noise for stressful work environment,if the volume of the recording had been a little more consistant I would have given this a 5. I like the sound of rain and thunderstorms and have found this to be quite effective in providing a pleasing background noise in a noisy and unpleasant work environment
1,could not download purchase,I cannot comment on the MP3 download because the download and the amazon cloud did not function. There is no way to contact Amazon???? I will not purchase another mp3 download until I can be sure of this function!!
5,Thundering Rainstorm,"I've been falling asleep to the sound of rain for over 30 years, and this is one of the best. It builds slowly, then thunder comes in. My girlfriend, who's hardly a rain fanatic, now keeps it on ALL NIGHT long.Whoever had a problem with some minor bird calls should listen to those recorded in forests whose bird shrieks and cackles used to give me nightmares. That guy's way too sensitive."
4,Good to relax to,"I have several Thunderstorm CD's and this is one of the better ones. Like everyone else, I do find the bird chirping to be disracting, but it can be ignored. I listen to this one to help fall asleepand it is a good CD. I am always on the lookout for a better one, but this is at the top of the list right now."
5,Good Looking Statue,"I'm not familiar with the anime or manga this character came from, but she's certainly beautiful. Really neat costume (hint of a nip there under the shirt so beware if buying for someone underage...which I'm sure wouldn't be an issue anyway, considering her pose, but I thought I'd warn).She's very sexy, and fun, a definite buy if you're a fan of hers, and enjoyable even if you just collect figures as I do. The changeable costume is simple and sturdy, and the details are wonderful. Very happy with this purchase."
5,Great Resource!,I was so surprised at the number of ideas in this book that could be adapted to the lower grades! Gallagher is such a gifted writer--this would be an enlightening read for anyone involved in teaching and motivating young readers. I loved the idea of second-draft reading! Students have the idea that once is enough and this is far from beneficial if we want readers to extract deeper meaning. He includes student samples along with many lesson ideas. There are even some activities for the reader to do to get an actual feel what you will be asking your students will do. He shows the difference between assigning and teaching. Well done!
5,Experienced Teachers - Read This!,"I have been a 6th grade teacher for 33 years. This book has done more to change my way of thinking about teaching reading than anything I've ever read. My students all come to me able to read. The struggle: those students who had been turned off to the joys of reading or had never bought into the notion of reading being a pathway to knowledge, and those students who read extremely fluently and loved reading but continued to read at a surface level.Read this book. Read it slowly. Digest it. Try out Kelly's ideas. Adapt them. Use them. You'll love the difference it makes."
5,USER FRIENDLY,"USER FRIENDLYThat about says it all.I got this guide with lessons to be self taught, before I decided to enter a Guitar beginners class at the local college.Found out later that the instructor was using a Hal Leonard instruction book too.It IS an outstanding source for anyone interested in learning how to play guitar beyond by ear.Don't need to know how to read music, it teaches you at your pace, and with the number of notes and chords applied to Guitar(s) (Acoustic, Classical, or Electric)One thing I've learned in the short time I've been practicing. If you are interested in learning to play an electric guitar, than I'd suggest getting both an inexpensive starter acoustic and an electric (or in that order). Why?The strings on an acoustic guitar require more finger strength than an electric, especially for beginners. If you master or are comfortable with the steel or classical strings of an acoustic YOU will be much better and easier to apply what you've learned to an electric guitar."
3,"A better title would have been ""Seven Songs and A Bunch of Riffs & Phrases""","Not a bad book, but not a great one either. This book is good if you want to brush up on a variety of acoustic styles or as a supplement to other learning materials. Each chapter is dedicated to a different style. Key concepts are laid out in a couple of example exercises followed by a few short song riff examples. Then a full song finishes up the chapter. This is nice; however, leads me to my biggest complaint. A good portion of the song riff examples are not on the accompanying CD."
1,Moves on and Skips Crucial Steps,This book teaches you a few chords and then 2 pages later introduces a song containing chords that are not taught in the book - stupid!!!! I wasn't impressed at all.
1,not up to standard,Hal Leonard has some great books on learning to play guitar but this is not one of them.
4,I'm glad I bought this book,The reviews below helped me to buy this book. I consider myself an early intermediate player not a beginner. This book was exactly what I was looking for. The author assumes you know the basics and teaches techniques (advanced strumming and fingerpicking etc....) using snippetts of popular songs. Then uses those techniques in a full length song.Now go practice!!!
2,Misleading Song list Only 7(Seven) complete songs,"I haven't had much time to spend with this book but based on advertising give it 2 stars. It is disappointing that the publisher writes on the front cover and list on the back ""A Complete Guide with Step by Step lessons and 45 (forty five) Great acoustic songs.The fact of the matter is there are 7 (seven). Including Barely Breathing, Dust in the Wind, Here comes the sun, Name, Wildwood Flower, Cross Road Blues and Angie. The other 38 ""songs"" are segments between 2 and 6 measures."
5,Great beginner book,I received my guitar lesson book within just a few days from placing my order. I have been doing the small practices it introduces and I am beginning to feel a bit better about playing and not making a fool of myself. This is the first time I have put this much effort into learning to play guitar and it is fun. The book is very informative and takes steps to ensure you feel comfortable with yourself and your guitar.
3,Not exactly a step-by-step lesson book,"The title of this book can be a little misleading. It doesn't give much of a step-by-step approach and it doesn't explain well enough to understand. This book is good for people who are a lot more advance and want more knowledge about their playing. And for those who want to learn some good acoustic songs, this book will be the right one for you. But I strongly suggest for those who are new, get a guitar instructor to teach you the proper way of playing these songs. Trust me; it will save you from struggling."
5,Well worth it,I own this product and have had it about 5 years now. It is great. I read a lot of paperbacks and it really works well reading in bed trying not to disturb others. It has a bright light and the batteries last a good while. I gave my 80 year old mother one and she thinks its great!
3,Swept From the Sea,this British movie is filmed beautifully. The scenery is just breath taking. the acting is very well done. It has several twists here and there.
4,Good....Could have been better,I really enjoyed this movie however one of the more interesting parts of the movie was not fully developed. Ian Mckellen's character was supposed to be homosexual .....he is in love with Vincent Perez's character. It was a pretty subtle subplot in the movie and while I was watching it I was thinking....hmmmm is Ian Mckellen's character gay? I read Roger Ebert's review of the movie on [...]. In his article Ebert says the movie could have been more interesting if this plot was further developed....I agree. I really enjoyed the movie but I thought Ian Mckellen's character was very interesting and if his desires were further explored it could have turned this fairly ordinary romance movie into an extraordinary movie.
3,Unfulfilling,"Attractive but ultimately unfulfilling. The story is slow and evocative, deliberately paced and linear. The performances are generally acceptable, however Kathy Bates's accent was weak and Vincent Perez was not credible as a Ukrainian -- he simply did not look the part! The climactic scene that forced Rachel Weisz's character into the storm was poorly directed and there was no precedent in the depiction of Mr. Perez's character that would lead to such threatening behavior, even in delirium. I'd like to see this story filmed again by a different director and with another male lead."
1,ugh,"very very depressing , and even Rachel Weisz' fine acting couldn't save this sad tale . I would not recommend it"
3,Not enough heart,"I bought this thinking it would be a good romantic movie for a Valentine's Day viewing. The product description made it sound much lighter than it actually was. Instead of putting us in the mood, we just felt depressed after watching it."
1,Not good at all,I bought this movie because the reviews were great. I was very disappointed waste of my time. This movie is very scattered and in my opinion not much of a love story.
1,yuk!,"This was not worth the download-I would not recommend it to others! Also, it was very depressing movie! Was life this hard?"
3,SWEPT FROM THE SEA,"THE MOVIRS WAS EDIT .I DON'T BUY MOVIE THAT EDIT MOVIES I GONNA SENT IT BACK.BUT SOMEONE WANT'T LET THEM HAVE'T,"
4,"Oh the Sea, the Sea - such Beauty, such Cruelty","A realistic story that captures the emotions brilliantly...the frustration of the protagonist in not understanding another language, his childlike expressions of happiness, and of course the love he eventually shares with wife and child. The story seems fresh and new even though infused with age old elements of fear, misunderstandings and other human frailties, and also of friendship, loyalty and love.The viewer is left to fill in spots in the story and there are some weak points but overall this is a winner."
4,"Well made, could have run a bit longer","This is actually Joseph Conrad's AMY FOSTER, retitled for the film. Well acted, well filmed, good sets. However, it lacks a little something compared to the written version, and I think a a bit more character development would have improved the film. Don't view this if you are upset by sad endings, or a character coming to a sad end."
4,Forbidden Love Story,This movie was more enjoyable than I had expected. The acting was wonderful and the scenery was beautiful. The story begins at the end and goes back to how the two lovers found each other and is told by the elderly doctor. I recognize many of the actors but cannot recall by name other than Rachel Weize(sp) and Kathy Bates. But it was very well acted. Good Story with a bittersweet ending. Good movie to watch curled up with a warm beverage.
4,"""I'll Be There"" alone makes the entire CD worth buying","I've loved the song ""I'll Be There"" since I was 10 years old. It moved me the first time I heard it, and 9 years later, it still moves me. It's just a truly powerful song. The rest of the songs are good enough, but just this one song makes buying the whole CD worth every penny."
4,"SEX, DOLLARS & ESCAPISM","This is the follow-up to their 1988 hit album Wild Wild West. The Escape Club produce a dance-friendly blend of rock that incorporates elements of funk, reggae and house music. Lots of great songs here, like I'll Be There, Call It Poison, So Fashionable (a wry comment on the empty lives of models), Freedom (catchy as catch can), and Sugar Man (a dead ringer for Lou Reed at his peak). Intelligent lyrics, hearty hooks and tight playing. Snap it up!"
2,Just looking for a single tune,"I found the song ""I'll be there"" and it is as I remember it from radio. A magic text together with corresponding music.However the other stuff is poor. That's why the two stars."
4,"Check out Black & White also, + where Billy Goat are now...","Black & White, a later Billy Goat CD is well worth your listen. The most recently released recording of a band who were way ahead of their time. Yes, people would really get naked whenever they played the song ""Clothes Off"".http://www.myspace.com/billygoat"
2,Base of the pan is too small. (somewhere between 5 and 6 inches),"It's hard to tell what the width of the pan's base will be by looking at the picture. It would be useful for the product description to specify the base width.The base of the pan was much smaller than we expected; somewhere between 5 and 6 inches. It's much smaller than other 8 inch pans we have. The pan is also deeper than we expected, which might explain why the base is so small. We intended to use the pan for pancakes and omelets, but its just to small for that job. We're sending the pan back in exchange for the 10 inch pan. Unfortunately, we'll lose the shipping on the return. Hopefully this review will help someone else avoid the same mishap."
5,This pan works very well with gas - on low setting. Period!,"Just bought this pan via e-bay ($12+shipping). Did not know what the brand was until I found it here on Amazon. Have been searching/buying/trying/comparing several pans for sauted/roasted potato, carrot, onion with olive oil/butter with touch of Italian seasoning dish I make regularly. [Have stopped using non-stick.] This little pan is perfect on low gas heat. Quick cooking because the pan really gets hot and retains heat; believe that is why many say food is sticking [probably a combination of electric burner and/or heat too high for this pan]. I toss the food while it cooks - this pan is light enough for me to do that. Believe this pan is lighter than cast iron of same size. This pan is made in Germany and is enamel over steel. Just right for me. Good luck with your search! Recap: Gas, low heat, lightness works for me."
3,A Bit Too Salty....,"These aren't bad, and are great for camping and emergencies, but be sure to have plenty of water because they are rather salty."
3,Its good...but not Great,"The boys of Skid row headed back to the studio to record ""slave the the grind"", after their plantinum selling self titled debut. Upon its release, it rocketed to #1 on the bilboard charts. The first time I heard the cd, I didn't much care for the exceedingly long songs. I was looking for another ""here I am"" or ""Youth gone wild"". however it wasn't here. There are some good all out rock songs here. ""Mudkicker"", ""Riot act"" and ""Creepshow"" are all top rate. I personally loved ""Quicksand Jesus"" and ""Wasted Time"" Overall, I score it 3 stars, its a good listen, but not nearly as addicting as the debut."
3,Sebastian Bach's Last Stand,"Sebastian Bach should have gone down as one of the greatest vocalists in rock history. Instead, he'll have to settle for semi-legendary status. This album, not a great one, still demonstrates his amazing range, especially on the first track, ""Monkey Business"" and the last one, ""Wasted Time"". The band's later work was weak, mostly because Bach couldn't meet his old standard of performance, but it's worthwhile giving this CD a listen. It was the last stand of a one-man band."
4,Rocks with controlled abandon,"'Bass as he is known now because of the Super Group TV show on VH 1,is a rock legend, and rightfully so. He has pipes and knows how to use them. This is a classic 80's rock fest with all the power and verve to make you grit your teeth. Production could use a little tweaking, like a lot of the 80's CD's. A little bright, not enough mids. There is a reason that Skid Row still sells. This is good,crafted, and well sung rock. More original sounding than Poison or Warrant. More melodic than Anthrax or Motorhead. Great to play over and over, which I think is what the hair bands gave us. Don't think, just rock. Check out the underated Blue Murder CD made by John Sykes who was the guitarist and side singer for Whitesnake. If you like the 'Row, you will love Blue Murder. Great vocals too!"
5,skid row's best album now n'forever!,"last night i listened to this album again,i found it was hard to stop the band to rock.""in a darkened room"" shows the climax of bach.""monkey besiness""still the great one,how soon the beauty remains!"
1,Amazon unscrupulous,I ordered an Artisan 50 printer from Amazon. A few items came up saying I might need these too so I ordered some extra ink. It came but did not go with the printer. What a rip-0ff.Epson Claria Hi-Definition 79 High-capacity Inkjet Cartridge (Black) (T079120)
3,Why No 6-Pack?,The Epson 79 Black Claria Hi-Definition Ink cartridge is of a high quality ink and with the Epson Stylus Photo 1400 printer does print a impressive photo...one of the problems I have is why Epson does not have an option to sell a six pack of the Epson 79 Claria Hi-Definition Inks that are required for the Epson Stylus Photo 1400 printer? The second problem I have is the high cost of these Epson 79 Claria Hi-Definition Ink cartridges especially having to buy the ink cartridges seperately.
5,Epson Ink,"I use Epson printers whenever I need the highest quality photo work. I've owned a few in the past. For best results I stick to Epson ink. Who would know best how to 'load' their own printers for best results? If you print on an Epson, and use their ink, you have eliminated the printer as a source of any graphic or color problems. BTW, even my oldest prints, 20 or more years old, show no evidence of fading. I strongly support the use of Epson ink!"
3,Cheaper from Epson,I second the other reviewer's desire for a 6-pack. But note that these cartridges are now $18.99 at the Epson store with free shipping deals. Some states do require sales tax but I still came out with 2nd-day shipping and less money for a set of 6.
4,Available as a group of 6,"Available as a 6-pack from B&H for $17.98 ea (including $5 s/h to TX). For mass printings, I've had good luck with the 14 Pack of LD Products Epson T079 compatible (4 black/2 each of the colors) for $90."
3,Beautiful results but at a high cost,"I have a large format Epson photo printer that I regularly use for proof runs of photographic work. While the end results have always been satisfactory, the so called high capacity cartridges have been a disappointment. Even with infrequent printing a large amount of ink is utilized to keep the nozzles primed/clean so you can expect to be replacing this expensive ink on a regular basis. I have tried bulk systems as an alternative but found the results to be significantly below my standards for photographic use in terms of print quality."
3,As Promised but it did not work,This product came in a timely manner but was not the right cartridge for my EPSON photo printer even though it says that it is. The printer states that it cannot recognize the cartridge. Fits perfectly and looks exactly the same but does not work. Lot's of money for something doesn't work
4,nice pictures,"again, I wish these products had an 'overall' card with the group picture on one card, as well as individual. This would then be AMAZING product for teaching kids on the autism spectrum."
1,High Priced Baloney,"In theory, this is a wonderful book. However, unless you knowFrench and have been cooking for a hundred years, you might want to think twice before shelling out this kind of money. The translation is AWFUL, with some recipe cmponents being translated two ways in two different places. There are hundreds of instances where the translation is simply WRONG. If you read French, you can sometimes puzzle it out.The index is also inadequate. There are multiple components to many dishes that really could/should be stand-alone recipes. Yet in this encyclopedia, it is impossible to find these components without having memorized the main dish's title.The pictures are wonderful. There are lots and lots of wonderful recipes in here, but somebody should have turned this over to some English speaking chefs and recipe writers before letting it hit the streets.Big disappointment, and for what is probably the most expensive cookbook ever, it shouldn't be.Buyer beware."
1,Interesting ideas but too many typos and mistranslations,"This could have been a wonderful book. There are many exciting recipes, both in concept and execution. Alas, where some techniques are explained ad nauseam, as if to a five year old, others have no explanation at all. Fortunately the original French titles appear alongside the English versions and quantities are given in metric as well as American measurements. There are a number of errors in the English version. Of particular interest are the recipes for sous-vide cooking. But,even here,timing is often omitted. I shall use the book but it is a disappointment. I wish I had bought it in the original French although there is no guarantee that the editors were any more attentive to its production"
5,Fantastic Book!,"I think it's really helpful for professional chefs. Nice photos with detailed recipes. This book is really great, especially compared to the other book I bought, 'Pierre Gagnaire: Reflections on Culinary Artistry', which had nothing but photos (and worse, the photos are zoom shots of ingredients, giving no ideas on overall food presentation either) without any recipes. I strongly recommend this book!"
1,Defective set!,"The first CD was fine, but the second one was a blank! Couldn't get it to read at all! Need a refund or replacement!"
1,Glenn Miller's All time Greatest Hits,Disappointing. Not very good recording. I returned it and got the Glenn Miller story recordings instead.
3,Nena's 20th Anniversary Concert DVD Collection,"I remember Nena when she came out in the states back in the early 80s with ""99 Luftballons"" (I preferred the German version over the English version) and thanks to relatives in Germany have been able to keep abreast of Nena's continued career. This 20th Anniversary concert DVD is chocked full of her old hits and some new(I especially love her rockin'/techno version of ""Beng, Beng"" with TokTok), and with a lot of special guest singers and even a reunion with her original bandmates. If you have a region free DVD player and wondered what Nena has been into since her one-hit wonder here in the states, this DVD gives it all."
5,"beautiful results, fun and easy process","The 3D templates are easy and a lot of fun to use. In addition to thetemplates, template frame, 1/2"" plunge router and special bit it is useful to have various sized clamps to keep the carving object stable. We have carved interior/exterior doors, garden gates, stair risers, frames and fireplace mantels with great success. I only wish there were more designs in different sizes to add to our collection because the possibilities are only limited by the size of the design. The process is easily mastered: I am a woman with limited woodworking experience and successfully carved our garden gate the first time I used the set."
4,Couvre takes away the shine!,"Couvre takes away the shine of your head, which makes your hair appear thicker. I am able to use just a little at a time, rub it on with what looks like a makeup sponge, and not have to use Toppik like I used to when I wanted to take away the shine of my scalp. I will buy it again. A little bit goes a long way, so it is economical in the long run. I recommend it!"
1,Won't buy again,"Yeah, it covered it OK, however, it didn't stick to my scalp. After a half-an-hour, it didn't dry. So, when I put my hand on it, my hand was 'Couver'd' with it.The advertisement says that it immediately adheres to your scalp and existing hair and won't come off until you shampoo it off...Bull! My pillow case took two cycles to get clean after an evening of wearing the colored creamy stuff.Wear with caution!:("
5,Never be without it,I love this product. I have been struggling with hair loss for years now and I needed something to cover up the thinned out areas. This is a incredible product and so so easy to use!
3,drama queen,Like the book. There were a lot of poems not in this edition for my class. In newest edition more info about authors and readings.
1,"Badly Written , Misinformed","I found this book unhelpful and badly written , i think i may look to get a refund."
2,wave yoga not so stretchy,The M size of this product is for me not tight enough.From the same company i had the maya short and this M fits better.The material of both trousers is a little hard.
4,Lots of laughs,Sparky has a unique talent for mixing fiction with real sports figures.I passed this book around to my friends and we all enjoyed it!
4,GNT STARTING POINT STUDY BIBLE from ZONDERVAN,"This Bible was purchased as a gift for a recommitted Christian andupon reading it for content and ease of study I purchased severalmore. In fact, I am using it as a supplement to my daily Biblestudy as it is an easy read, understandable and includes real lifesituations to further explain the passages of scripture."
3,Good Read,"#18 in Rimmer's Bravo series.Both the hero and heroine pride themselves on their steadfastness, the opposite of the rest of their crazy respective families. Imagine their self-disappointment when they each fall for the wrong person! So, they resolve to love each other, without being IN love. Of course, the usual emotional roller coaster ensues.There may be few surprises, but a likeable couple, strong secondary characters and a friendly setting add up to a good story. Enjoy."
1,the bad movie over shadows the message,I understand that during this modern day resetion this movie is right on time I also have full respect and appreciate for the independant film circuit some the best and most revealing films have come from that format. But this movie was so bad I wonder how it got made I feel that the makers of this film dug down so deep to show you the pain and life changing losing your job can be that they forgot about artistry and presenting it became overacted overstated with no solutions or examples of survival after a set back just plan dispair.
2,This movie was a surprising letdown.,"I had been wanting to see this movie for the past two years, and I finally got the chance. Surprisingly, I found it to be a real letdown. It focuses on the life of a teenage girl named Dedee, who visits her half-brother in Indiana, after her stepfather dies. Soon upon arrival, she seduces her brother's gay live-in lover, then later tells him that she is pregnant with his child. From that point on, Dedee spreads bad luck to those around her. Even though some of the actors/actresses played their roles very well, I did not like the flow of the movie. Overall, I thought that it was pretty boring, and I did not like it."
2,Rent before you buy!,Very over hyped movie. Really disapointing. Other than Lisa Kudrow not much going on here. Some interesting dialogue but not enough to carry the movie. I wanted to like this movie so much but I can't recommed it.
2,Confused girl.,"The Opposite of Sex is that kind of drama-comedy that give an improvising plot, with no direction and no solution. Cristina Ricci is convincing in her role as the confused girl, the other gay boys are not completely involved in this kind of theme, they only can produce a mediocre acting work. This kind of film is not for the mature audience, because it gives no solution or a rational ending to the exposed problem."
4,"Smart, but problematic","Smart Dialogue and clever conventions. I would rate this higher, however the waivering sentimentality really made this otherwise acrid comedy an endurance test. Guess I'm like Deedee - I take my comedie's black and very bittersweet."
4,horray for christina,i think this movie was totally original but one thing reamins those who are offended by raw language this film is not for you all in all this movie was great!
4,This is a cool movie.,"Intelligent, funny, attitude. What more do you need in a movie? I loved the irreverance to the audience the twisted story line but most of all the movie unexpectedly brought up many of the questions about love, sex and relationships we all probably have floating around in our heads. Watch it with a beer, watch it on your own or watch it to see whether Deedee's ideas about 'straight' men's reactions to gays is right. Ricci has certainly grown up since Mermaids and the Addams Family. Its nice seeing TV stars get a chance to act too."
5,Great movie,"This movie's great! My only complaint is that Lisa Kudrow's hilarious lines are few and far between. She's so great; I hope she gets bigger parts in future movies. Oh, yeah, and Christina Ricci's great too."
2,Not a good movie!,"This was a very boring movie. Cristina Ricci was good, she had a new style who look good on her, she play very well the girl who fool around but she really get on my nerves and a lot of time. Lisa Kudrow was very bad in that movie, she was plain, had no character and get also in my nerves. The gay brother of Cristina in the movie is so boring, he got no personality. The movie have no real plot, the movie didn't mean nothing except it's was really boring. Well I guess it was just suppose to be a funny movie who mean nothing, well suppose to be funny I don't say it was funny!!!"
5,Cool and real!,"""The opposite of sex"" is one funny comedy!I thing that this comedy is cool!And it have people like the people in the film in the real world.I meen people like Deede-gays.And this film is helpful for them.In comedies like that they see the funny side of the things.So i thing that ""The opposite of sex"" is cool and real!I lke the actors in the film.I love Lisa Kudrow!I see her in my favourite soap opera ""Friends"".She is gread actric.So thats what i thing forthis film."
1,The Opposite of Good Taste,"Do not get me wrong, I think that Christina Ricci is a great actress. But this movie, it s*cked. The whole point of it was for the main character to realize love's true worth? Give me a break! The beginning was going so tasty. But it got drab and stupid after Ricci and the once gay, now heterosexual, ex-lover of her step bro, run away. This guy had to be the dumbest person I have ever seen in movie history. Even Forest has a leg up on this guy. Then at the end he finally realizes that he's still gay!! Duh! This movie was given way too many props. Please save yourself from disappointment, and regret."
1,Christina should have stayed with The Addams Family,"If Christina Ricci was looking for a role to separate her from the roles she's played before, this wasn't the one to take. She is definately worthy of a better performance and script.The plot is missing and the acting is bad. From so many talented actors, it is a great disappointment. Johnny Galecki's nauseating performance as a gay man is insulting to the gay community.The production itself was disasterous with bad sound and at times lighting.Definately a movie not to watch."
1,One of the most overrated films of 1998,"It never ceases to amaze me that there are people who rave about this movie. Sure, it has promise. Christina Ricci is one of the more promising young actresses working today. But the script and premise is woefully contrived, dull, gimmicky, and ultimately uninvolving.Much praise has been heaped on Lisa Kudrow for her supporting performance. Unfortunately, it would seem that the people who have praised it have never heard of Teri Garr, whom Kudrow seems to be working overtime to try and imitate. Pity, as Kudrow has displayed talent.So forget this movie. If you have not seen it, all the praise will just end up letting you down."
1,The opposite of great,"If you like your films to be fast food with extra fries, if you live in a trailer perhaps, or drink lots, perhaps get into fights and have the police around, swear like a trooper, didn't do too well in school, shout to your friends at the other end of the street, buy books at the supermarket, wouldn't know good dialogue from bad/great acting from not so great, think that George Bush is right about gay marriage, or maybe went to an American Idol audition even though you can't sing... well, get this film because YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT."
3,Black humor at its...best?...worst?,"This movie requires a decided dose of disbelief and humor. Viewed from a purely real angle, the ""Opposite of Sex"" may seem amazingly cruel. Viewed as pure black comedy, it's very successful at poking zingers at just about anything you may hold dear. Christina Ricci plays a very convincingly mean spirited little b***h bent on getting exactly what she wants, as if life owed her a huge favor. Lisa Kudrow is incredibly anal and delightful. Despite all, it's a clever analysis of how tortuous modern relationships can get. Lyle Lovett seems a bit miscast at times. If you're going to see this, be warned."
2,Opposite of sex is a boring film,"I think the only thing I liked about this film is the cast. Christina Ricci is very good in her character, she knows how to do it and she can be sexy if she wants to. Lyle Lovett is fine too, but not as Christina. The story isn't much interesting, and it has to end a lot before it does, because it turns very long. It's about a girl (Ricci) who falls in love with her gay brother's boyfriend, and the same happens to him, but the story is like a chewing gum: it comes, goes, and turns around again. Don't lose two hours of your life watching it."
2,A refreshing look at relationships,"What better way to examine relationships than through the eyes of someone who really doesn't have them? A trashy young girl gets into a load of trouble and finds that perhaps there is value in relationships afterall. If you liked ""Get Shorty"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" you will probably like this."
4,Very funny - especially Christina Ricci,"This is a very funny movie, especially in the writer's extremely self-concious use of Christina Ricci's voiceover narration. Her character is a hoot! The movie is a little weaker when dealing with more serious pathos, which seem somewhat out of place in such an irreverent movie. The picture and sound quality of the DVD is excellent. The extra scenes and audio commentary don't give much insight into the film. I could only stomach 15 minutes of the audio commentary track which was too stream-of-conciousness for its own good."
4,"Cutting Wit, Good Cast (and, even a funny ""Friend"")","Christina Ricci is marvelous as the sarcastic narrator of this witty, sly little film. Although the plot has a few not-so-plausible glitches, in my opinion, the cast, including Lyle Lovett and Lisa Kudrow, make the film a worth-while endeavor. Some of the one-liners in this movie are lost if you only give it the once over. It's comedy that remains true to the characters; its character sketches that are worth fleshing out; and its multi-dimensional so it satisfies the audiences who may view it multiple times and discover tid-bits they missed the first time around. Intelligent and engaging, it should have found a broader audience; it definitely has a broad appeal. It's not only worth owning, it's worth loaning to friends and family who may, just by looking at its packaging overlook it, but will watch it because you asked them to. They'll thank you later."
5,"Extremely moving, and very funny!!","""The Opposite Of Sex"" is such an extraordinary film. If you think a comedy can't move you, and if you think a drama can't be funny, you must watch this movie. It does exactly that! The acting is top notch. While all the actors in the film deserve recognition for their work, the one that stands out the most is Lisa Kudrow. She was [cheated] out of an Oscar nomination, and win for that matter. The story is very intruiging, and original. A hard thing for a comedy these days. Also, this movie has some of the funniest lines I have ever heard, I laughed till I cried! The best thing about this film is the ending. A wonderfully poignant tapestry that will stick with you long after the movie is over. This one stays with you long after it is over, and is an unforgetable, and wonderful experience."
4,Strange but Interesting,"Delightfully different coming of age movie. You may have thought your teenager had an odd slant on life, but this young lady takes the cake, among other things. Funny and sad."
4,"Why does it always have to be about the sex, Why not Shampoo, I want a good Shampoo!","WHat I like about this movie is its corkiness and Its able to take things to another level of an in your face black comedy and its unbashful way it stereotypes its characters. The movie after a while just drags and gladly waiting for it to end but my rating is solely on one scene that I hold close, It's when Lucia( Lisa Kudrow) and her deceased brothers' lover ( Martin Donovan) have a conversation about sex and her brothers passing of AIDS. That dialogue was so original and a light way of approaching the AIDS topic not done in any other film with a PUnch, of course."
3,Not for the real estate professional,"This book is good, and at times entertaining (something you don't expect in a technolgy book), but if you are looking for specific guides and standards that corporate real estate professionals need in developing their strategies, then this is not the resource for you. It may help you develop you thought process about what you need to consider in establishing a call center, but it falls short in the development of strategy."
1,only works with one type of carrier,"I thought that this would convert any carrier- it ONLY snaps on to one (Italian) brand of carrier. If you don't have that carrier, you're wasting your money, like I did."
5,The Bible for Artist Models,I have been an artist model for three years. Recently somebody trashed me out for doing my job. Reading Theresa Danna's book boosted up my morale and made me hold my head up high. Now I have the verbal weapons to defend myself against such ignorant people.
4,The Bare Facts of Modeling for Artists,"In ROLLOVER, MONA LISA, subtitled ""How Anyone Can Model for Artists,"" the author calls upon her years as a professional nude artist's model to demystify the profession to aspiring models. One of the best sections deals with Cleo Dornan whose modeling career spanned decades! Included with the 60 illustrated pages are biographies of a number of famous models throughout history. This is a fast, fun read, especially if you have an interest in the arts and entertain either curiosity or fantasy about actually becoming a nude artist's model. Read it -- you'll like it!"
4,"Well written, informative, and novice friendly.",My first attempt at learning linux. Helped me familiarize myself with how linux works.
4,Perfect for the power user who is new to Linux,"Teach yourself Linux in 10 minutes? Well, not exactly, but each lesson is written to represent about ten minutes worth of work. Although a small book, it goes into detail about how the Linux operating system works and how it differs from other PC or Mac OS's. The author frequently mentions, ""other PC operating systems you may be used to."" Clearly, this book is aimed at those already familiar with computers but new to Linux. The author discusses specific examples of commands to perform various Linux tasks without going into too much detail. Instead, he points the reader towards how to get help on the Linux system itself. The author also assumes that the reader already has Linux fully installed. The result is a quick, cheap reference guide for Linux newbies who are already computer literate."
5,Practical Advice from a New Perspective,"There have been only three real breakthroughs in project management in the past 7000 years: earned value, critical chain, and lean methods. This book provides the reader with a practical methodology to apply the concepts of Lean Thinking to real project and product development work situations."
3,Pot-pourri of practical ideas on lean project management,"This book promotes lean project management, in other words how to perform effective project management without excess bureaucracy.Some interesting ideas such as : stand-up progress meetings, rules about emails, right level of standards (with increasing formality, work rules, checklists, guidelines/templates and standard work method), staged-freeze specifications, protecting the critical core with buffers, resource reservation which allows to get the resource active on an upcoming task as soon as it is delivered, thereby avoiding queueing."
2,Network planning and firewall implementation,"The broad scope of this book's title isn't matched by the material inside.Discussions of policy and planning are reasonable.Most of the book is a screen-by-screen example showing the setup of Checkpoint's Firewall-1. Some Cisco router information is also provided.Oddly, no mention is made of wireless LANs; they are perhaps one of the greatest security threats and should be in any book discussing security and networks."
3,A Choppy but Charming Romcom Morsel,"Clever writing and a couple fine performances make this short film worth your time. The directing and editing aren't so great: the movie has a choppy feel, with several poor transitions. Some of the acting is downright bad (the director has to bear some responsibility here too), but the film is redeemed by a solid contribution from the male romantic lead (find out who at the end), and a side-splitting performance from Kymm Walker, who plays the trouble-making best friend. Ms. Walker almost single-handedly made this film transcend its production values to seem polished and professional. I hope we'll be seeing more of her in the movies."
4,TRC Boynton Bch,"I thought ""Avatars"" was a very entertaining short film. Robert Khoury did a wonderful of job writing the screenplay and Bob Campbell and Mike Ofenheim also did an excellent job with the direction and production, considering this was their first film! The young and talented cast was outstanding and helped make the film very amusing. The subject matter deals with something we can all relate to today - Cyberspace. It takes a funny yet realistic look at internet dating, cheating and the real life scams that are out there. I especially like the ending. I highly recomend this film and look foward to their next project."
4,Rudy gives it 2 thumbs up,"A smart,witty short story. Enjoyable on many levels. Jennifer Strand is excellent."
4,Good moviebut not perfect,"I like the continuous change of funny and pointed dialogs in the movie. The music underlines well the story; the lightning gives the scenes a particular character while the scenes itself string well together and smoothly develop the story to an end. The actress Jen Strand is playing well, while for the actors Kymm Walker and Brian Woodard I wish to see a little bit more engagement in their roles. Kymm could act a little bit friendlier to Jen, her best friend in the movie. Brian on the other hand, he acts a bit as if he is reading the script. Last, I feel something more contemporary than the papyrus scroll from which the email is getting read to the viewer should have been used since the story is getting developed around the Internet. Overall, the movie is a good entertainment."
4,A Writing Gem,"This is a ""Thinking"" movie, so turn on your brain cells before hitting the play button. Cleaver writing using lyrics from a Beatles song in the 60's as a pickup line for the new cyber dating format of the zeros. An entertaining compilation of wit and insensitivity concluding with the surprise ending."
1,no good,"I cant believe I wasted 38 min of my life on it, don't waste yours :( terrible acting, wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Poor Acting and Quality,"I would never recommend this movie to anyone. The best performance in the movie was given by the actor playing Charlie. Jenna's timing was lacking, the role of Tyler should have been recast, and Lisa was whiny with no facial emotion. Better actors would have made a better film. The writing left me almost angry. The intended one liners were lost on the actors.I wish I had not viewed this film."
5,Loved it!,"We first heard this story at a story time. It's a fun, quirky, fresh take on an old classic. The rhymes are cute, as well as the maid, and even Rapunzel comes out looking good. I have two boys and, even though it is probably more of a girl story, they love it. I will probably buy this for my nieces come birthday time."
5,One of the best fairy tales ever!,"Leah Wilcox (author) and Lydia Monks (illustrator) have retold the Rapunzel story in hilarious rhyme that captivates my children (and me for that matter!) They love to hear this story over and over - they laugh harder and harder as confused Rapunzel and her hapless prince get more and more outrageous. While he tries to get her to throw down her hair, Rapunzel throws down everything but the kitchen sink. The humor is sweet, the ending is unexpected and happy, Lydia Monks' illustrations are perfect. Our family loves everything about this book - and their other collaboration, Waking Beauty."
4,Fun book to read,"I bought this book for my little girl. We both enjoy reading it together. This is one of those picture books you can read again and again with out getting bored, and can enjoy together. The pictures are entertaining and well done. We are glad we bought it."
5,Hilarious!,"Forget the old Rapunzel -- this one's much better! I just happened upon this one in the local bookstore in town BookPeople, and I'm glad I did. It's a great retelling!"
5,squirreldive is tripping.....,"To describe this album as ""cliched"" is the most backwards review I've ever heard. Not to dismiss squirreldive's review or anything, because do I see the similarity to Nils Petter Molvaer's ECM recordings, but this is very unique music. Tracks like ""Magrouni"" are so unique, yet at the same time work perfectly. There is also a mind-blowing dynamic range in the songs. Lyrical duets, like the ethereal ""Nina Valeria,"" are juxtaposed next to experimental ""beat-boxing"" tracks, like ""Parlophone."" Phillipe Garcia's drum n bass inspired drumming cut deep grooves into songs like ""The Point."" Truffaz follows the pioneer of fusion trumpet, Miles Davis by using a wah pedal on the bonus track, a reprise of ""Magrouni,"" to create a marvelous energetic effect. The album is solid from start to finish, but don't take my word for it; listen to the samples."
2,"""man, tis is disappointing""","I loved Mr. Truffaz's album ""the mask"" and its super-hyper jazz. But his follow up is quite the opposite. ""Mantis"" for one incorporates a terrible cliched electric guitar. It sounds familiar to the style in which Nils Petter Molvaer uses it on his record ""Tlon"", which i recommend over this mess of songs. It seems that Truffaz has lost his edge and direction, which he tries to cover up by throwing random genres of music into boring, beaten-down tracks and surrounding those songs with even more lifeless music. Truffaz is great, just in a rut(i hope?)."
5,"Yes, it seems, I am a superficial man...","I learned something new after reading A.J Pascale's witty and insightful look into the male psyche. Not only am I a superficial man, but that it's cool to be one. It's in our genes. Or in our jeans, at any rate. Susan Marks' entertaining illustrations are perfect for Pascale's sagaciously cynical view of modern romance. Forget Venus and Mars, and get this book!"
5,An Excellent Guide in Helping Self and Others,"This is an extraordinary book written by an expirienced therapist in the field of Meridian Therapies. Dr Gallo gives us quite enough theory and history about developing techniques such as TFT, EMDR, TAT, NAEM... But the value in this book is authors PRACTICAL approach. By learning methods described here one is able to become a really high efficient therapist and can give lot of relief and benefit to oneself and others.Dr Gallo bravely and openly shared with us many secrets of the Energy Psychology. We just need to take the keys and open the door.I personally thank to the author as I gained much sucess for me and for other people by applying the techniques that I learned from his book. And really, this wasn't so hard to achieve.I give my strong recommendation about this book to everyone who is willing (and brave enough) to start learning on the path that leads to helping self and others."
3,Multicultural Education,"While it is vitally important to make our children's education multi-cultural in a genuine sense, this book is really for professional teachers and teach-at-home parents. Well written and with lovely bibliographies, it is definitely worth the time of educators."
4,"Rank 1 Mix=Fantastic, Trick Or Treat Mix=No comment","Guess the Trick or Treat mix of this tune cofirms my suspicions that they're a pair of clowns. Not content with ruining one masterpiece of a tune (Warrior), they do it to another one!The classic Let Me Be Your Fantasy vocals are cut down to a supporting role, while that fool MC Tails with his bo selecta rubbish ""raps"" over 2-step tripe. Its actually a lot worse than it sounds. Suppose it does have a bit of a comedy value though........The Rank 1 mix on the other hand is fantastic!! Huge Airwave-style synths mixed together with the ORIGINAL vocals and music, it works absolutely brilliantly! Better than Airwave even? Me thinks so!The 2rd track on the CD is the original, I think you'll all know what it sounds like. If you don't, you must have been living under a rock for the past 10 years."
5,When I read this book,"I came to a conclusion:This beast got away from an UFO!All the detail points to that..No, my friends: We are not alone in the Universe...and this is a heinous proof !"
5,One incredible gem of knowledge after another!,"During my first read through my jaw kept dropping as I came to understand how little I know about screen acting, even at my low level of experience.This book did more to open my eyes to the virtually hidden peculiarities and demands of acting for the screen than anything I've ever read. The pages of review sheets at the back are worth the price of the book.The style is readable and the author speaks with the authority of experience. I'm sure that this will turn out to be the best investment I've made in my fledgling career as a film actor. I'm going to give this book to my closest actor-friends. I can't think of a better way to show how much I value them."
5,Very Informative,This was a very informative book for my Acting for the Camera students. Promoted interesting questions and good discussion.
4,Unabashedly deconstructivist,"Deconstruction is alive and kicking in the writing of la Spivak. Oddly enough, when noone else seems to be doing it. Yet, in her practical criticism of theory and pedagogy Spivak is more than coherent and consistent, and this is due mostly to her endorsement of post-structuralist ways. Highly recommended for those who want to witness a truly serious academic stretching a point!"
3,returned because I found something cheaper,"The Price was fine and that was important as we were just replacing the blades on an old junker we keep around but I did find a cheaper blade at Menards (under two bucks with rebate) that worked fine. As always, amazon was great to work with in returning the product."
5,AND HE JUST KEEPS ROCKING ON.......,"How could he get any better I ask u, I have been listening to Curtis for ever & he never ever let's his fans down in anything he does......Rock on Curtis E. Salgado!!!!"
1,Warning! This ISN'T the movies!,"I purchased this thinking it was a double feature of the Harry Potter Year 7 Parts I & II MOVIES. It's just the special features (commentary and deleted scenes and such.) Who would buy that? Nine times out of ten when you buy the movies, it comes with that stuff, and most people don't really watch all that anyways. Who wants JUST the special features. Do not buy this product. I returned it immediately and still have yet to get my refund, though in all fairness, it's only been just over a week."
1,Waste of money,This movie package misrepresents the content.I thought I was buying the movies and instead got two disks of special features. I'm sending it back tomorrow.
1,Rip Off Alert! No Movie in Here!,"Do not buy this 2 disc set. It contains snippets of scenes and bonus materials only, yet it's presented as if it contains the whole movie. I want my money back!!!!"
1,Special Features Only - Does not have the films!,"Don't buy this title! I bought this title from another retailer, and wish I had gotten it from Amazon so I could RETURN it. What surprise to load it into the blu ray player to find it only has special features and neither of the actual movies! I checked out these Amazon reviews to confirm I wasn't crazy or that both my blu ray players needed some kind of update, and found that all the other reviewers had the same issue I have. No films?? C'mon Warner Bros... Who buys just special features???It looks like they made some kind of production mistake, but I'm not sure what I can do now since I don't have the receipt. The packaging does not indicate that it is anything other than both full length films. I've been deceived and I cannot figure out how to express my dissatisfaction with Warner Bros."
1,DVD VERSION?!?!?!?!,"So, I collect all of the Ultimate Editions of the Harry Potter films on DVD, but THIS one is only available on Blu-Ray!!!! I am so frustrated and don't know why it's not available on DVD!!!! It's the ONLY ONE NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD!!!!!!"
1,Caution - Received Two Sets of Bonus Material Only,"Those interested in this 2 disc set supposedly featuring both parts of The Deathly Hallows may want to wait until a problem I've encountered is resolved (or try buying elsewhere). I ordered a copy from Amazon, received it and found that both discs have bonus material only on them---no feature film. I checked the size of content on each disc and they are only 6gb and 8gb--so obviously no hidden feature anywhere on the disc. I ordered a replacement from Amazon and noted it came from a different location but received the identical set of bonus materials..."
1,Discs do not match box,"I ordered this item and was disappointed to see that when it arrived, the discs did not match the box. The box says it is for Harry Potter Year 7 feature film part 1 & 2. The discs are Harry Potter Year 7 special features only part 1 and part 2. One disc actually is labeled special features, but the other says it is the full film, yet it is not."
1,Language of the Movie,The Deathly Hallows Part 2 of the movie set switches from english to a differennt language during a viewing. This was not specified in description when product was ordered.
1,COMPLETELY WRONG! VERY DISAPPOINTED,I was very excited to complete my Ultimate Edition collection. I just recieved my order in the mail and all I got was Deathly Hallows Part 1 in Blu ray (MISSING A DISK I MIGHT ADD) And Deathly Hallows PArt 2 in Blu ray! WHERE IS MY ULTIMATE EDITION?? I could have bought these at the store?!?! RIP OFF.
3,"Just the same old, same old",I only bought it because I have the other Ultimate Editions. The first two editions in this series are the best.
1,Defective,"Same here. This double feature only contains special features, not the movies. It is misleading at best, hope Warner Brothers clears this up.UPDATE 11/30/2012: called WB 1-800-553-6937 and they admitted the manufacturing error and mailed 2 new BDs with the movies and special features on them. It does take 2-3 weeks to get the discs but there is no charge. They were very apologetic. Thanks WB for making it right."
5,Would recommend,"Love the MYST games, love to play them, but I found myself often having to refer to a cheat sheet. The puzzles were way out of my league. The first MYST was the better one and the puzzles were quite doable...this one though, well, the puzzles are quite challenging."
2,Myst URU,"I am a great fan of Myst and all its variants, but my operating system (Windows 7) does not support Myst URU, nor am I aware of any patches that will remedy the problem. Thus, I wish I had known about its limitations before I purchased it.MYST URU - COMPLETE CHRONICLES (JC)"
3,"Three Original Byrds, But Not Much To Crow About!","I/m a big Byrds fan and have only just come across this album.It's well showcased in a small cardboard box and there are some postcards included which advertise other CDs in The Originals set.When it comes to the content I find it very difficult to get excited about any of the 10 songs.Don't Write Her Off is OK, but very little else.The Byrds always had something new to offer, but sadly not this time."
3,Not bad,Came on time. Holds 18 cigarettes. only problem is top of case is coming unglued from 1 side. Nice quality otherwise. A bit over priced.
3,Much better,"In this second volume, Ms Fallon seems to be much more inspired: the setting is just as accurate as in the first book (see my review) but her characters, all of them, gain strength and depth just as the pacing of the story shows much more care.As a logical result the story becomes much more interesting and one really begins to care about what happens.Her writing too seems to have improved and it add to the pleasure of reading"
5,One of the greatest books for Beginners!!!,It's really a good book to improve your game. I examined a lot of books but I didn't find any book like this! Because it really expains what you have to and what strategy is. I'm sure all beginners have to buy and read.
4,A Pleasing Rehash of Classic Examples,"Silman presents a fairly good book that does prompt one to think and the exercises build on that. Throughout the book are examples that I've run into before including one game between Kavalek and Karpov that is actually misquoted. Silman's games are also used as examples and for the most part those are very refreshing. While I'm only 1500 USCF, I think this book will be useful to players 1200-1700 and above or below that I must question its usefulness. If you are in that range, buy it! It is worth the money and more importantly it is worth the time to study it well."
3,Basic documentary but not a feature length movie !,"Clearly not living upto it's title [chess mastery course] this book enhances the positional, tactical and other subtleties in a chess player upto 1500 rating. No thorough treatment of any subject yet it encompasses almost all matters. well almost ! Good for beginners and seasoned beginners..but once you get to Intermediate level [1550-1750] you'll be reassured that you have `Chess Praxis' and `My System' on your shelf !"
5,Awesome Book!,"You will gain a vast amount of knowledge about certain important situations that commonly occur in practical play. Such as the concept of when you have a bad bishop: try and get the bishop outside of your pawns! This book certainly doesn't begin to touch on every situation you will come across, but for what it covers it will prove a valuable reading experience!"
3,Good book.....,"This is a very good book on the middle game in chess. Most authors tend to either oversimplify or overanalyze this area of the game, but Silman does a good job of doing neither, while still giving you the ideas and thinking tools you need to really improve your game.My only complaint in the book is Silman's amazing ego. Almost every book he recommends is one he has written himself, and almost all of his examined positions are positions from his own winning games. Still, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who's seeking to become a competitive chess player."
4,Great Book for Intermediate Chess Players!,"I took in this book last year and read it cover to cover. The details and concepts explained in this book are stated thoroughly. With patience and intense study, this book has helped me become a solid player! Great book to further our understanding of this complex and exciting game."
2,"very, very had and doesn't always explain","The Reassess Your Chess book doesn't explain things well for a person who is just beyond the beginning stage. It assumes you know a lot, but it doesn't tell you this book is for more advanced players."
3,"Certainly a famous book in the Chess fraternity, but buyer","...beware. This book is way over my head and I didn't understand that from the reviews I read here on this book. It sounded like just the book for me as I progressed as a beginner. This is not for a beginner! Much better for my purposes is the series of Yasser Seirawan books. Now, Silman's Reassess is famous, no doubt, and it sits on my Chess shelf awaiting the day I might get something out of it. But that day is some while off!"
4,Delivers what it promises,"Let's critique this book via the Henry James method: ""What is he trying to do? Does he do it? Was it worth doing?"" What he's trying to do is clearly laid out in the title: ""How to Reassess Your Chess."" This book is to help players with flawed technique or bad habits understand and correct the inadequacies in their play. Does he do what he sets out to do? An emphatic ""yes""! This book totally changed my way of thinking about chess. Was it worth doing? Another emphatic ""yes."" As someone who'd been playing chess for about 20 years without getting any better, this was exactly the book I needed, and it has paid off handsomely. I'd give it five stars, but as an editor myself, I do have to knock off a star for the sloppy editing and amateurish typesetting (you can see the dot resolution of the laser printer it was run off on, and on about one page out of every 20, the publisher never got around to updating the typeface to Garamond from Garamond Antiqua)."
3,"Laughable editing, good content","This book proves that one can have a deep understanding of chess yet have a laughable command of the English language. This book is poorly edited and in need of revision. Furthermore, Silman's hubris rivals that of Kasparov with very little to back it up. The content is very good, however, and serious study is very rewarding. My play has improved just by using the thinking technique."
2,see Euwe's Middlegame book,"When I read this book, I found it interesting and good. At the moment, however, I'm reading Euwe's Middlegame books and ...surprise surprise... I discovered that most of the positions reported by Silman are taken from these two books. I don't think the book is bad per se; it's just a recapitulation of Euwe's work (plus, probably, some parts taken from Pachman's Middlegame book) with some practical advices. My advice is: buy Euwe's books instead of this one."
3,Great but needs an updated version,"When I first bought this book a few years ago I thought it was the best ever. I've now pulled it off the shelf and I'm going through it again. This time I'm using Fritz 6 to help me anaylyze all the positions and games. I immediately learned that Mr. Silman was in sorry need of a computer himself. There are a great deal of places where the analysis in the book is just flat wrong. Again and again the computer finds a much better move, often one that isn't even listed. I think Mr. Silman would do every body a service if he went through all the games with a computer to make sure he wasn't missing a lot of tactical issues. If he did that and re-did his analysis, the book would be top notch. I bet he'd be surprised what he missed."
2,"A good book for a beginner, or if you're in a creative rut","Here are my qualms with the book: 1) The book's layout is not conductive to holding it while studying a game. The book is too short and squat (it's a trade paperback) to crack the binding. 2) Nimzowitsch is dead so he can't sue for copyright infringement. The book is mainly a reworking of My System put into more user-friendly terms.On the other hand, the chapter on planning in chess is worth the price of the book alone."
2,Not for most kids,This book is far too advanced for most kids. Being in tournaments for 2 years I still find a lot of the way the author explans things to be hard for me to understand. He thinks you know alot before you even start the book and goes on and on with ideas that first require him to BACK UP and explan.
5,Great middle-game book,This book has helped me improve my game more than any other I have ever read. It is not the proper book for the novice and it requires a lot of work from the reader.I can't claim that I worked as hard as J.Silman requires but the time I spent reading and thinking certainly took place.Some reviewers say that there are weaknesses in the positions and that computer analysis proves that there are better solutions than those proposed in the book. I didn't check anything with a program and don't really care to do so.This book has given me new ways to think during the middle game.It doesn't refer at all on the opening (although all middle games derive from openings!) and occupies only few pages on the endgame.Overall... five stars. It's worthy.
3,Lots of ideas but sometimes difficult to understand,"There are lots of interesting ideas in Silman's book, which over all is fairly good. I learned some important things from it. My biggest problem with it is that sometimes it isn't clear what the author is talking about. I am a decent player rated about 900. The problem is probably because I am a kid the level is above me. So for an older I would give it another star."
4,A very useful but flawed book,"Some people are wild about this book; some of us aren't. The reason for the disagreement is that, on the one hand, Silman's understanding of the game is terrific, and Reassess Your Chess has many very valuable ideas in it. If you study the book, your chess will improve. On the other hand, the book is poorly written and edited. I don't mean that it's unclear; I just mean it's sloppy. If you don't care, you'll adore the book. If your love of chess books is a subset of a general love of *books*, it will drive you crazy. If only Silman would hire a first-rate editor and let him have his way with the book; alas, one sometimes gets the annoying (and sometimes embarrassing) impression that Silman has an awfully high opinion of his own abilities, and perhaps that hubris extends to an overestimation of his amateurish abilities as a writer. Let's hope for a future edition that does better."
5,How to Reasess Your Chess,The best Chess instruction book I have ever read( read about fifty!) Anything by Silman is exeptional. I think any level of player will benefit but ideal for the club player upwards. All books make great claims for themselves. This one actually delivers.
2,Skip this Carlos effort,"Not his best. I love Carlos and his collaborations, but this is weak. Carlos sounds great as usual, but the songs are lacking. The contributors are, I'm sure, excellent in their fields, but this is not the place to learn about them because the songs are just not good. The Gregg Rollie and Ottmar Liebert songs are pretty decent. The ones with John McLaughlin and Stanley Clarke are just not worthy of their talents, but at least their musical skills show. Otherwise, I would have given it a one star. If you cut out the parts played by the other artists and just listen to the Carlos parts, it might be a decent CD."
4,The Best Answer I Have Read To That Question,"I always seem to like what Dinesh D'Souza has to say. His book whose title is the question, ""What's So Great About America?"" is no exception. But I have to be honest. The best answer I have read to that question is the book, ""West Point: Character Leadership Education, A Book Developed From Thomas Jefferson's Own Readings And Writings"", by Norman Thomas Remick. Sorry Dinesh."
5,Should be Required Reading!,This book articulates very deep feelings and reasons to hope for the future of America. It should be required reading in every college and high school in the United States to counteract much of the negativitism rampant in too many circles!
5,Genius,This book was simply outstanding. It has changed the way I view the world and America. This should be required reading.
1,Propaganda alive and well,"If you'r looking for the reasons the worlds leading ecomomy has so much internal trouble, you won't find it here. D'souza avoids subjects like America's self centred non-acceptance of the rest of the world, its gun culture and resultant crime rate etc. Presumably because he has no logical excuse for them. Though logic is hardly the word you'd use for his reasons for the US Constitution's writers hipocracy, the wiping out of the American indian or the invasion of Iraq. This writer knows nothing of cultures other than India which he obviously dislikes and USA.If you're American and need to salute the flag and stroke your ego then you'll get something from this book. Of course there are very many intelligent Americans out there and some of them have read this book. They must be extremely embarrassed, and I suspect anyone outside the US who has read it and not burned it is keeping it for novelty reasons only.I gave it one star because it loosened my bowels."
1,Not a good message,"The author does not give a balanced view of America. He misses poverty, the class system and about a billion other problems that would be of interest to a savvy reader. Give us all a break!"
1,"One of the""Empire's"" Greatest Cheer Leaders""!","I totally agree with the sentiments, and the facts presented by the previous review ""What's Wrong With America"", it is people like him who have to courage to stand up, dissent and to say, that we are not puppets to this charade of lies, corporate greed, and global hegemony. It's sad, that such progressive voices as Noam Chomskey, Howard Zinn, Norman Finkelstein aren't heard in the mainstream media, that is so much dominated by the right wing rhetoric of ""war against terrorism""."
1,FOOLish!,"This book is foolish apologetics exploring american culture as if it were inside a bubble, the world is no longer about boarders as it used to be, the author of this trashy convservative nonsense would be well off to read Hardt&Negri's Empire. Ask the worlds poorest countries suffering in debt to the IMF or World Bank if they have seen racism lately! Ask those people living in the poorest areas of every major american city if they have seen racism lately! While were at it lets ask why 75% of our countries prision space was built during the Regan administration? So our great noble country with it's wonderful president could wage racist sick war on ""drugs"" that lined the pockets of private interests building a prison industrial empire, this kind of conservative nonsense does us all a huge disservice."
1,A joke,"This book says absolutely nothing about the condition that America is in today; it says nothing about American history, nor the American people. It is just a collection of mindless warblings, fatuously childish ad hoc remarks by a doddering old fool who has made a career out of bootlicking the racist right. I would not recommend this even for kitty litter. Burn it."
3,Good analysis of cultural differences between India and the USA,"This books presents a fairly good analysis of the cultural differences between India and the USA from the author's point of view. It should have been appropriately titled in a way that reflects what the book is really about. The author has higher aspirations than that, purporting to have written an exposition of what makes the USA great not only in relation to his own Indian experience, but by absolute world standards. Obviously he has not, since he lacks knowledge of any other country except his native India and his adopted USA. His ignorance is exhibited in amusing ways throughout the book, as for example when he extolls the fact that poor people in the USA can get health care in hospital emergency rooms (the fact that health care in the USA falls far behing European and Canadian - not to mention Cuban - standards has escaped his attention)."
3,he sold his soul to the devil,"of course the title overstates my feelings about this book, this book did make me think about how i really feel about america, and while i was reading this book my feelings were anger, enlightenment, confusion, sadness, etc. so, this is a good book to read especially for first generation or 1.5 generation immigrants because it forces you to confront/examine your existence here in good ole' us of a. in final anaylsis, this book is not going to change any minds, that i am sure of. the author is what i call ""banana"", yellow/dark outside and white inside, this is not meant to be a slander just a description, he extrapolates his own previleged but limited experience to the whole of usa, and this will not go down well in liberal circles. so, if you are of conservative political persuasion, you will like this book, if not, you will not like this book, bottom line."
1,A Little Modesty Please People!,"You know, I would probably have to agree with the idea that America is the greatest nation in the world today (maybe ever?). But this does not mean that we do not have many, many problems to work through as a country. It frustrates me when people like D'Souza use what's so great about America as ammunition against anyone who dares be critical of what's not so great about America. If one only focuses on the good, and shuns those who bring up the bad, then the bad will never get fixed and America can never become even better! A little modesty will help us solve what problems we have rather than just ignoring them as people like D'Souza seem to do."
1,Poorly written rhetoric,"Being a conservative, I looked forward to reading this book; however, I found Mr. D'Souza's arguments to be immature and not well thought out. The world need less of the liberal-hating rhetoric Mr. D'Souza spews forth and more answers to fixing the real problems within our great country. To think that America is perfect, with no problems, is a dangerous attitude, and criticizing those problems is not un-American. The only way for America to remain great is to see those problems and fix them -- not blame them on liberals or conservative. After all, we are more than liberals or conservatives -- we are AMERICANS!"
1,Another jingoism fix for a society on the verge of overdose,"The problem with books like these is that it reduces a population to pacifism. If we're the greatest country in the world, then why bother improving? Better yet... anyone who wants to improve things must be against America!A true democracy thrives on feedback and evolution. A great nation has humility and respect towards other countries and cultures. Blind nationalism paralyzes the process and results in a nation that never gets better... and likely worsens over time for it's inflexibility."
5,A must for a native born American,"Having originally grown up in Bombay myself and a migrant to America, I can fully appreciate the argument he makes. I think that this is essential reading for native Americans to fully appreciate the privledge of being born here. He convincingly refutes the victim mentality of people or cultures who blame America as a cover-up for their own failures. I happened to glance at the book at [the store] and could not put it down till I was done 2 1/2 hours later."
3,Mostly Good- But a Mixed Bag,"An excellent and intellectual read -despite the silly title. As an immigrant D'Souza offers many insights into American culture that native born citizens like myself are often too close to see. His book definitely increased my love of America. His insights into the nature of Islam and American racism -of the lack thereof- are pointed. In a brilliant apologia for classical liberalism, he argues that the beauty of America is the individual's ability to fashion his own destiny.Still, when attempting to prove that America is not as immoral as radical Muslims make her out to be, he ignores abortion in America. And ignoring wholesale genocide is a big problem. Also, he misunderstands the statist project of the Federalists and Abraham Lincoln and casts their goals in favorable light. He also ignores issues of constitutionalism when promoting the neoconservative project of American Empire. His examination of the Founders is one-dimensional and mythological."
1,What's so great about America (Conservative Edition):,"It can be summed up in one tidy little phrase: the unfettered and god-given right to earn, save, and invest money. You will never hear a conservative praise the artistic freedom of the United States, its respect for diversity, its secular government, nor the Constitution itself (with the exception of the Second Amendment, of course). Money and money alone gives them pause -- they proudly salute the golden calf."
2,"Save your money, there are better books out there","Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false. On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as ""isolated instances"" and not planned nor calculated. Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable."
1,Breathtakingly ignorant; don't waste your money,"Dinesh D'Souza, who emigrated here from Calcutta in 1978, displays a level of ignorance of American history, politics, economics and culture that is laughable. But for the Immigration Reform Act of 1965 - which was bitterly opposed by those conservatives who now treat D'Souza as their pet token, yet which was pushed through by the liberals he so despises - D'Souza probably wouldn't even be in this country. For him to accuse both Pat Buchanan AND the Rev. Jesse Jackson of ""hating"" America demonstrates the pathetic level of his discourse. Don't bother."
4,D'Souza Will Make You Think,"Dinesh D'Souza's book ""What's So Great About America"" is at heart a defense of America by an immigrant to this country. The reason why America needs defending is the unrelenting attacks on this country made primarily by liberals at home and abroad. He takes a variety of issues such as colonialism and race relations among others and causes you to think about them in new ways. For instance, he points rightly that while America was wrong to have practiced slavery for several hundred years, we are also one of the few countries in the world to abolish it (and the Civil War was an extremely high price that was paid to abolish it). D'Souza is honest and admits that America is not perfect, but it is also not deserving of the hatred and animosity displayed in varying degrees by many groups profiled in the book. Be prepared to have conventional thinking challenged when you read the book."
4,Very informative!!!,"Since Sept. 11th a lot of us are intrigued with the people of the middle east.This book is well written and explains why we are hated so much and yet admired. How they want to experience America, yet want to remain in their own world.This book is awesome!!!"
1,Don't disregard this review because of its rating,"It makes me sad when people who are otherwise good, are so ignorant of the things around them. The blandest american car, the newest fast food outlet, the mainstream movie scene...as the culture of a new beat surges beneath the surface. I can see why so many of you embrace the idea of a perfect america, but it is a one-sided view. America has become a place where the good have been declared won, and the rest cast away. This is a place that can say, Utopia has arrived! If you can't pay the entrance fee, get out! And then refused to look at its own flaws. I am begging you, for your sake and the sake of america, if you want a true and thought provoking epiphany of american philosiphy, read America, by Jean Baudrillard.Vives sans temps morts!WarAgainstSilence"
1,What a guy!,"Does your house need painting? Then hire this guy, his skill at ""whitewashing"" on a grand scale is second to none!This is the kind of book that confirms everybody's prejudices, and adds nothing to their knowledge.If you are a gung ho patriot, you'll believe every word and assume that America is indeed God's chosen country.If you already see America as rather less than spotless, this book will confirm your suspicion that self-styled patriots couldn't tell fact from fiction if their lives depended on it.And if that's want you want, this is the book for you!"
1,"Racist, elitest, and ethnocentric!","D'Souza is one of the most racist, elitest and ethnocentric men I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. This book is full of misinformation, overgeneralizations, and outright lies. Please don't support this man by buying his book, when there are so many other great reads out there!"
5,I Bet the Right Hates this one,"Finally, an excellent book has come out by someone who actually knows what he's talking about. I bet the neo-conservatives are running for cover from this one. Dinesh D'Souza restores my faith in America. He's a breath of fresh air after all the raunchy political pornography that's being churned out by people like Ann Coulter and Michael Moore. This is what America's about, about telling the truth, and this guy knows the truth.Don't you guys see how refreshing and invigorating it is to tell the truth? Pull the black veil off your hearts and ENJOY America, our beautiful country. Nothing is as patriotic in America as the TRUTH, why can't the bickerers learn that.This book really tells what's right about America. I was wondering if it could be done anymore. Lay down your broomstick and black hat Ann Coulter, I bet you hate this book!"
4,"Codswallop -- wow, I use a word no one else uses.","""This is about the devaluation of foreign currencies, the homogenisation of global culture, the massacre of innocents, and generally making the strong, richer and the poor, weaker."" To the reviewer who wrote this: did you get this viewpoint from your college political science class (taught by a disgruntled academic) or did you come up with this completely unoriginal idea on your own? Try not writing reviews that use such time-worn cliches.By the way -- just because you don't agree with a book's point of view doesn't mean that the book isn't good. Why don't you try writing a real review that is useful?"
3,too much theory ?,Theory on Japan by the West? Perhaps you can appreciate interpretations and evaluations of Western culture. A culture reads an other culture. A not Japanese interpretation method interprets an alien and different world . Is it right to do this?Filippo Zizzo
3,A useful introduction,"I picked this enjoyable booklet up at Narita Airport on my way home from yet another visit to this interesting country. By the time I landed in Frankfurt I had read it from cover to cover.The book is conceived as a primer. Contributions are organised in brief chapters, each one focusing on one important aspect of Japanese culture. One learns about rituals, aesthethic categories, myths, principles of social organisation, role models, etc. Each chapter concludes with a series of assignments for discussion activities in classes.With short chapters, a glossary and a fairly extensive bibliography, the book is obviously conceived as a broad brush introduction to Japanese culture and a stepping stone towards further study.For those unitiated to this complex and sometimes baffling culture, the modest price of this book is money well spent. But for an in depth treatment one definitely needs to look elsewhere."
2,Poorly written...there must be better...,"The standard of writing in this book is surprisingly poor, and it was repetitive. It read to me like it had been written by young teens, and it played out like the sort of classroom discussion where everyone thought they had something interesting to say without managing to state much intelligently at all. Having said that, it was interesting to read about some of the concepts for the first time - though I do wish I'd found a better book for it. If you're 16 or younger, you might find this book tolerable.Read the other reviews for more detailed and erudite critiques - I just wanted to add my thumbs down to the rating."
5,The perfect companion for students of Japanese,"I happened on to this book at the public library and picked it up because, it was the the most recently published book they had to choose from. I have been stdying Japanese for 3yrs and have visited Japan three times. Japan is a complex country with an even more complex culture. This book offers some general insight and context for understanding Japan and its culture. It is especially helpful for understanding the basics of communicating Japanese people. The chapters on tatemae, giri, amae and chinmoku are the most helpful. It is set up like a discussion book with breif class exercises at the end of each chapter, but it is the perfect companion for anyone who studies the language or regularly interacts with Japanese people."
4,Only 1 step reversible stroller available!,"I love this stroller - way nicer than my Gracco but 1/2 the price of the more expensive brands. This is the only stroller that you can switch the baby from facing you to facing the world in one easy step by flipping the handle - all of the others you need someone to hold your child while you remove and flip the seat. Also comes with more accessories than the average stroller - love the attached and rotating cup holder and the foot muff. Not sure how great the pictures are but this stroller has the BIGGEST canopy it will fold all the way down to the bar to help block the sun. The only 2 reasons i didn't rate the stroller 5 stars: 1. it didn't come with a rain cover, and 2. i had to watch a video to figure out how to steer it - you need to lock the back wheels for which ever direction you're going."
1,Looks aren't everything,"I received the 2006 model of this stroller for my baby shower. I has read good reviews on it and thought it was more attractive than your run-of-the-mill Graco stroller, and less expensive than the trendy Bugaboo. I am so dissappointed with the quality of this stroller, however. The main problem I have with it is that no matter what I do this stroller veers to the left when strolling. This make the stroller IMPOSSIBLE to use. I literally have used this stoller less than 5 times and I've had it for a year. Everytime I try to use it I get so frusterated that I want to just throw the stroller away. Please do not waste your money on this product."
3,Regency with dark undertones,"I liked the main subjects of this novel, Omega Chartley and Matthew Bering, in terms of their character and intelligence. I also agree with another reviewer that the side characters of Hugh, Timothy, Jamie, and Angela, are well written and enjoyable. In some ways I found myself caring more about the peripheral characters than the protagonist. What's unusual about this novel is how despicable the villain is (blackmail, child abuse, rape, and murder.) The storyline involving Matthew's past has very serious undertones which distracted me from the developing love story. It was also disconcerting that the character of Hugh seems somewhat disgarded in the end."
2,Not The Blues Traveler I Once Knew,"I have been a Blues Travler fan since a good old deadhead friend of mine turned me on to their awsesome jams in 96. I started listening to Four and than their first album, than Travelers, Save His Soul, which were all amazing to me. I was lucky enough in the fall of 97 to see Blues Traveler for the first time in a downtown theateR were I got to stand all night in front of Bob (R.I.P), which was totally awesome. I think Bobby was the main backbone to Blues Traveler and without Bobby to me, there is no Blues Traveler. Not a Blues Traveler that once kicked out the jams to great tunes that I still know. Buy anything up till Straight On if u want to hear the real BT."
2,i was expecting much more,"it seems that no two reviewers really agree on which blues traveler albums are good and which are not-so-good. if you ask me, ""Blues Traveler"" is good, ""Travelers and Thieves"" and ""Save His Soul"" are amazing, and ""Four"" is mediocre, and finally ""Bridge,"" which i think is pretty bad. Before i explain that let me say that the song ""All Hands"" is great (could have been better though) and ""Sadly a Fiction"" is pretty good. Most of the rest borders on garbage -- nothing more than pop songs that have been done many times before. Blues Traveler is one of my favorite bands, but they have lost it. I'm hoping they will find it and give us another album as soon as possible -- they have new potential with the addition of Ben Wilson, who is actually good on ""Bridge,"" using retro keyboard sounds, organs, and piano. I know BT still has the ability to rock, but they definitely do not rock on Bridge."
3,Or a stepping stone...,"After years of waiting and a few big changes, this band is back with two new members. Both jr. members are welcome additions, with Tad using some funked out bass to compensate for the late and great Bobby, and with Ben offering many welcome keystrokes. Yet the old band is giving the newcomers too much freedom on their first contribution. Gone is the harp, guitar, and bass driven B.T. of ole, leaving a fuller yet bland sound in its place. Now the signature harmonica lead is only present when overdubbed during Popper's singing. Reminisant of Popper's solo album, the lyrics depend to much on shallow cliches, though there are exceptions. Overall half of the album is amazing, but this is the first of the B.T. albums that I'll have to skip a few songs during, and that sadens me. Hopefully the power of the stage will bring the band back to its roots and to a better follow up album. Dedicated Traveler"
4,UELHSKII (whatever your name is) is an idiot,"Blues Traveler is back. The best harmonica player in the world has returned with a powerful backing band and created a red carpet for phase II. This recording is filled with sentiment for fallen bassist, Bobby Sheehan. Showing some emotion after your closest founding band member is gone only certifies this as meaningful music. Everyone from Metallica to the KING bled feelings of loss. ""ALL HANDS"" is old Traveler. They did an exceptional job of doing this tune live at the Beale Street Music Festival a few weeks ago in May 01. This recording is produced extremely well and results in some very good and typical Traveler JAM."
4,Back On Track,"O.K...so ""Straight On Till Morning"" wasn't BT's best effort, but this can now be regarded as a mere creative bump in the road with the release of ""Bridge"". This cd is an absolute treat that gets BT back to what they do best...JAM. Lyrically, the cd may not hold up to ""Travelers and Thieves"", but musically this is a slam dunk. The addition of keyboards is tastefully done and I can honestly say (after recently catching them live-5 stars) that they are as tight as they were 10 years ago. The fact that no radio stations are playing ""Bridge"" should tell you that this cd is a keeper."
4,WE'LL MISS YOU BOBBY,An amazing return to form from a band that was pushed to the brink but didn't fall over. Pretty angry may be one of the most heartfelt tunes Popper has ever written. I dare any hardcore traveler to listen to it and not get choked up. Here's hoping that this is the start of a promising new era from one of the best bands to come around in the last 20 years.
4,Another Consistent Effort,"Blues Traveler's music is so refreshing in this age of hip/hop, girl/boy pop, and grunge. These guys play straight forward rock n roll with feeling and emotion. Johnny Popper and the guys are back in form with a slight shift in style. The additional of a keyboard player really helps as Johnny has an extra foil for his harmonica playing. The keyboards also add a few extra dimensions to the songs these guys can record. Tad Kinchla replaces the late Bobbie Sheehan as well as can be expected. Many of the lyrics reflect on Bobbie's passing particularly track #7, Pretty Angry where Popper asks,""Why Could It Have Been Me?"" Sadly A Fiction also plays up the tragic loss. Most of the tracks rate as high quality material but Back In The Day, Girl Inside My Head, The Way, and Just For Me in addition to the two previously mentioned tracks standout the most. With that much good material you Amazon Readers need to buy this one today."
5,Another inspired album,"Thank you, Blues Traveler, for another inspired album! Old travelers and new ones alike will find this proof that great music doesn't go out of style. Sure, this album is different than the ones before it...this group is always evolving. To listen to them jam is transcending! Buy an album, go to a show, see what you've been missing out on!"
4,Can be bought for $45 brand new...,"from the Yale Press. I did not realize this until I had purchase this book used for $40. Used books suit me fine, but if you prefer a new copy for minimally more expense, then you might want to check it out.I have no experience buying from the Yale Press, but buying from Amazon has always been pleasant."
3,The lay out of the book continually irritated,"I am more than a little surprised that other reviewers gave this five stars. The general lay out, indentation, bullet points, nu mbering etc was bewildering - there simply was no proper schematic to the book. The book read like a book in progress and in need of a great deal of polish. Nonetheless, Dungan has some vey interesting ideas about the development of modern hermeunetics, namely that in its worst form, it follows the rules of Spinoza whose subtext was the destruction of the Bible as the word of God. And, that fundamnetalists are in truth followers of John Locke' subjectivist philosopy. Its interesting that he considers that catholics scholars such as Raymond Brown have avoided the worst excess of the modern approach. Overall a little disappointing."
4,Not durable,"I get good voice reports from those on the other end of the call, so the microphone itself is of good quality. I do like having the volume control on the line -- that is very convenient.That said, this headset is not long-lasting. With enough rotations of the microphone swivel, the ""teeth"" eventually will eventually wear and file to engage, making the microphone flop straight down. It's not a bad headset for the money, but it is not very durable."
4,Quirky,Taibo is quirky. I like the Mexican politics in his books.He has multiple storylines that sometimes don't seem to connect.
1,Unreadable,I just could not get into it. Perhaps the English translation? If you want to read a great detective series try Michael Connolly's books featuring Harry Bosch. Brilliant and engaging....
2,I was very happy with the exam cram series until now,"I was pretty disappointed with the material that covered DNS. This is major section of the exam, and this is what made me fail twice. I barely failed both times, but the DNS questions were much more complex than what was covered in the book.Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of experience with DNS because our org doesn't use Windows DNS, so I think that hurt me, too. Someone with a couple of years experience with DNS might do fine, but try to get another source if you don't."
2,Weak in DNS and subnetting,"I wouldn't recommend this book to prepare for 70-291 test. It doesn't cover DNS and subnetting very well. IMHO, Microsoft's Self-Paced Traninig Kit for 70-291 is a better choice to prepare for 70-291 test."
3,This book is not for the 70-291,Other reviewers seem to have chosen the wrong book to review for some reason. I find it hard to believe that they can write a competent review on any book given the fact that they can't perform a simple search and post more than a few sentences on how they dislike a book that if read for one exam is probably not going to have a great deal to do with the other. Seems rather silly to me.
1,Official Guide to FrontPage 2000,This book is only good for building simple web pages like a personal web page. As for detailed information (like something useful) look elsewhere.
2,Official FrontPage 2000 Book,"This book is decent reference material for experienced web devlopers looking to learn the tools of FrontPage, but is not appropriate for beginners. The mateial is poorly presented, lacking in graphics, and is poorly written. The book is plagued by irrevelant information, run-on sentences, and topics being referenced before they are defined and explained. Aside from the fact that the authors clearly do not have a background in instructional design, it also appears that they might benefit from an introductory college English course. I can't believe Microsoft endorses this book!"
5,BEYOND PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY TIME FOR COOKING,"THIS IS AN EXCITING BOOK FOR CHILDREN, THEIR PARENTS, THEIR CAREGIVERS AND THE DIRECTORS AND TEACHERS AT CHILDCARE CENTERS OR PRESCHOOLS. THERE ARE MANY KID FRIENDLY RECIPES, CREATIVE CRAFT IDEAS AND SOME VERY ORIGINAL PARTY THEMES. I HAVE GIVEN THIS BOOK TO SEVERAL FRIENDS KNOWING THAT THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN WOULD HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH IT."
3,Too much time developing too-strange characters,"Buechner's latest has left me feeling like this novel was rather lackluster. The characters and their relations to one another became confusing over time, and far too much time was spent developing them, only to have them do basically nothing. Buechner seems to try too hard in this novel to make his characters ""unusual,"" giving them odd quirks that, over time, make them unbelievable. Also, there is virtually no movement of the plot -- the entire 200-page book is spent developing characters, only to have them radically change, reconciling past differences, suddenly in the last few pages. For all the plot development in this novel, it perhaps would have served better as a short story or novella, rather than a full-blown novel. Buechner is a gifted writer, whose work I have enjoyed in the past; this novel, however, left me feeling like I was reading about selfish characters who did nothing, and whom I cared little about."
4,"A subtle, moving, story","I love Frederick Buechner, although this is only my second book of this author! His writing both in fiction and other genres is rich and poignant. His allusions to spirituality is wise, inclusive and never ""preachy"". I marveled in the texture a ""real"" writer can give to a quite simple human story. Somehow I expected more of the ending, but I would still recommend it without hesitation."
4,"Good eye pencil, great color","I buy these when Maybelle's auburn eye brow pencils get discontinued, which seems to happens once every few years and then they are reintroduced.I think it's a great color. I am a redhead with blonde eyebrows and you can't see them unless I fill them in. It works great and looks natural next to my natural hair color.I think the price is a bit steep, which is my only complaint."
4,why so cheap?,"incredible... bought these for my bro n these turntables kick ass! jus as good as my stanton str8-100's, big thumbs up!!!!"
4,Best BANG for your buck,"this is a great setup for beginners, i like them alot, but i think once u use them alot, u realize they could u use better slip mats and needles. so i have changed the needles to the numark Numark CS-1 Carl Cox Signature Model Stylus. i love them, amazon sells it for like $45. there great. but otherwise these are great turntables, and the mixer is alright, after a while i would get a better mixer. but i really like this product, i would recommend to get better needles. And thats all!"
2,breaks easily,"I only had these for about a year and they slowly started slowing down. There's no belt, and the amount it would take to get new turntables would be ridiculous. All in all, they worked fine for a while, but I would recommend a different brand or spending a little more for something a little better."
2,BEAUTIFUL VISUALS BUT TOO STATIC,"I looked forward to this game as there had been alot of hype about it. It is visually beautiful (the chateau reminds me of Versaille) however, the game is low tech, very static and the player is extremely limited in movement and objects that may be picked up. This is dissapointing and spoils part of the enjoyment of the game (adventure gamers love to handle objects and explore every corner). The technology has come a long way since Myst began the craze but the people who created this game don't seem to be aware of this."
1,"too short, too boring","Most of it is trivial, and an average gamer can finish it in just a few hours. Spend your money on something a little more challenging."
2,Technical problems,"THe major flaw of the game was that after reading the books about the history of France, the information was NOT encoded in the player's knowledge and thus, the player could not proceed with the game (could not answer the duke's question). THis was very annoying, particulary after you spend time learning the (superficial) history of France. In addition, the controls were difficult to maneuver and static and the puzzles were not inspiring. THe graphics were good but it gets boring when you have to spend your entire time on the castle grounds...it felt like prison after a while. THere was no creativity in this game. I would not recommend it. UNfortunately, there are few very good adventure games. Even the Longest journey, which I had problems with, is superior to this game."
4,A Nice Piece of Americana but Not as Strong as Three Track Shack,"This is a nice album with some pretty well known musicians backing Wray but it is not his best album from this time period. His best album would be Link's Three Track Shack which is really a collection of three other albums. This album is in the same vein as Link's Three Track Shack but is not as strong and in fact has a few of the same songs rerecorded and repackaged for this album. The songs that are new are worth the money but only if you really enjoy the Link Wray from this time period. Don't try looking for the young dirty guitarist Link Wray because you won't find him here (even though it is the same guy). This album sounds more like The Band or the Greatful Dead than the young Link Wray. If this is your first trip into the Link Wray of the 70's than pick up Link's Three Track Shack, if your looking for a follow up to Link's Three Track Shack than this is your next and really only logical choice."
5,"Oh, the memories","I had no idea this album was still available! As a kid, my friends & I put on a ""play"" where we lip-synched to the soundtrack. We had so much fun playing Nathaniel and his lovable dog.... Anyway, this is the story of a little ""grublet"" whose brothers decide to break from the grublet tradition of taking broken items and fixing them. Instead, they simply start stealing things--and get mad at Nathaniel when he won't go along with them. From the same folks who brought us ""Agapeland"" and ""The Music Machine"", this is a great fairy tale with the moral that stealing is wrong...but taught in a gentle way. I loved it as a kid!"
3,"Looks Nice, but...","I'm possibly thinkign about getting this item. It's toward what i am looking for, but i'm disappointed that the only details it gives is what it's made of and the weight. Too bad it doesn't give the dimensions so if i know it's the right size."
4,Auto guys must read,Excellent coverage and integration of key players in the auto industry.I enjoyed reading and learning about each of the princible leaders. I would encourage others to give it a read.
2,No bad choices but . . .,"This book is a great start for anyone trying to understand the contemporary auto industry and its place in the world economy. I encourage readers to seek out information on William (Billy) Durant, Ferdinand Porsche, The Whiz Kids by John Byrne, and, in particular, Alfred P. Sloan [My Years with General Motors] to understand the underpinnings of these leaders."
1,six men who built the modern auto industry (bet it's good),"Never did recieve the book I ordered! They were sure quick to take my money, but now this is the 4th time I've tried to contact them about not recieving it & no one will reply!"
5,Ground Breaking Testimonial for the Group Think of the Future,"I found this book enlightening, more in the areas of the management of complex tasks, with diverse groups of contributors. I highly recommend this book on those grounds, in fact I think the target audience is well outside of the subject matter and needs a more wide publication within the circles of economic thought. Maybe capitalism and socialism as two intractable and exclusive positions of economic thought is woefully outmoded and requiring a more open minded look at how the principles can be re-aggregated to serve the common good of society. A marvelous testament to human endeavor with a great deal to offer in the orchestration of similar efforts..."
1,WHAT???!!!!,I can't believe this cd exists. If you dont like the lyrics then why do you even bother to listen to the band? What has this country come to when you cant buy an honest piece of filth becuase its not pc or acceptable to the mickey mouse family. Heres a tip pull your head out of your rump and join the rest of us in the real world! BTW SKID ROW ROCKS!!! Buy the untainted version instead. These cds should be systematicaly rounded up and destoyed.
5,This is a great book.,"Real Ponies Dont Go Oink by Patrick F. Mcmanus is about a whole bunch of outdoor humor stories. He tells about different things that happend in his life but he uses other peoples names. The humor that Patrick Mckmanus puts into the stories makes the book hilarious. Patrick Mckmanus not only showed that he could write a funny book, but it was also easy to read. His style in the book would like you're seeing it from different angles. One minuite it feels like you are in the book , the next minuite it feels like you're watching other people. Patrick Mckmanus went from funnny to hilarious. Overall, this book was the funniest book I have ever read. I highly recomend that you take the time to read this book and enjoy it. It will make you lagh untill you cry."
3,"Pretty cool, if you like that sort of thing.","I think that ""RPDGO"" is OK. It's off the wall, funny, and different. So different, in fact, that it took me a while to get into his style. (I hadn't read anything of his before.) I didn't finish this book for a long time; I guess I just DON'T really like that sort of thing."
3,Love McManus,I love most of McManus' work. This had some solid and funny stories in it but Pat seemed a little off his game in this one. I would still recommend it but there is better out there.
5,Hilarious,This author is hilarious to read! All his books are full to the brim of side splitting humor and a very easy read!
5,Quick response,I must say I was amazed to see how fast the service was.I was expecting to wait at least a month before receiving the parcel.Well done.Clinton Ferreira
3,Reason,"Hi, the book is sitting in my friends home in the US so I haven't yet seen it. I'll be there early next year to pick it up"
3,Description error,"Product description says unit has balanced input/outputs but the manual confirms they are actually unbalanced. Will not return because the price is right and it seems to work for my purposes, but be warned if you need balanced."
4,Very happy with this mixer!,"I received one mixer originally that was dead out of the box. I had to mess with it to get it to power on (my first indication of something very bad) then once I got the power to stay on there must have been a short internally because it was just generating a ton of noise when an output was connected to the A side (in mono or stereo). I put an exchange item order in through Amazon and they sent me a new unit out 2-day shipping and I printed out the return label, put the old one back in the box and dropped it off to the post office the next day.I was extremely happy with Amazon's response over this, it was extremely simple and efficient.The second unit came in and it works perfectly! I'm using it to pre-mix a set of drum kit mic's before sending to out mixer through two snake channels. I'm keeping the higher drums/cymbals on one channel and the lower drums on the other so I can eq them differently. It works great!"
3,Umm,"This is actually closer related to an album. I just got three of these movies (one being Star Wars)from an older woman across the street who was moving. I originally thought they were laser disc and since I had an old laser disc player I would be able to see Star Wars as it was originally without the digital effects Lucas crammed into it. I soon discovered it was not laser disc and was actually more like an album. It uses a groove and needle just like an album an only holds about 1 hour per side. These were out in the late 70s to mid 80s and $300 for a player is INSANE! So that's what I know about this stuff but there is plenty of info on them on the web, just google Selectavision. It is pretty cool tech if you are into older gizmos but as a modern device you really ought to look into a little thing called DVD...LOL"
3,"Laserdisc-or whatever this is, is DEAD!!!","I wrote a review for this item in response to other reviewer. Laserdisc failed!!! Not only do we still have VHS, their is something called DVD! Its a laserdisc thats the size of a CD but no flipping! Besides this isnt a laserdisc, im pretty sure its a CED machine. Its like a record that plays videos. It could be a LD machine, but this looks like neither."
4,Finally,"This book, I've wanted for more than 5 years and now,I am thankful, that I finally have it! It was worth thewait!"
2,It's okay...,I didn't really like this book. I purchased it for a small group study. She sounds like a real feminist and some of her paraphrases are blatantly inaccurate. It could have been much better.
5,Understanding Economy,I have the original Edition . It is a wonderful book to understand the basis of Economy. It is a Classic¡¡¡ ( The first Edition)
4,Good Motorola battery,"It's a good battery but not the best one. Remember this batt has 820 mAh and could perform with a normal, regular period of talking time in your phone but if you want to improve it you would get to try the BK series for more mAh."
2,Wrong Item!,Ordered BC 60 and recieved BC50. It will work but has less amp hours so wont last as long. Not worth the trouble of exchanging. Will use but am not happy.
2,CHRISTIAN TAPE FOR KIDS,The seller was lovely but the tape is boring...not the Bullfrogs & Butterflies tape we had when our kids were toddlers.
2,Photograph significantly different. Case shape not exact.,"Although the name says ivory, I was misled by the photograph which shows very light colour (No, not my LCD's fault. Its a Mac. I also verified it on my workplace's 19"" high saturation Dell LCD. Surely, this photograph is poor).Infact the dial colour closely matches that shown in Women's Tommy Ivory dial watch. Also, I felt the watch case had little bulge on sides (2-3-4 and 8-9-10 ones) making the watch look little elliptical instead of rectangular as the photograph shows. Also it was bigger than I expected it to be. Metal strap was unappealing. Returning it. I'd rather buy a fossil."
3,Interessant,"Un livre d'introspection écrit d'après des questions très justement posées concernant les pensées négatives qui nous hantent ou qui nous empchent de vivre. Pensées qui bien souvent ne nous appartiennent pas mais que nous avons fait ntres à cause de notre éducation, du regard des autres, de la mode du moment...Ces pensées sont des freins , des obstacles à nos désirs et à ce que nous sommes réellement. Ce livre apporte de nombreuses reflexions pour se libérer de cet imaginaire qui s'impose inconsciemment à nous, un imaginaire dont les limites rend des individus malades de ce qu'ils sont. Un livre qui peut permettre à chacun de reconnatre l'origine de ses douleurs et se réconcilier avec soi-mme."
1,I never received the product.,"I never received the product. Made a claim to the provider, and still I have no news. I recommend other buyers never to buy something from this russian provider."
2,ITEM WAS FLAWED,"""PRODUCT ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY & WAS OF FAIR PRICE BUT ONE OF THE DOLLS IN THE SET IS FLAWED & WILL NOT CLOSE. I NEEDED THIS ITEM TO FILL AN ORDER OF MY OWN & SO THIS ISSUE WILL CAUSE ME MORE WORK AND DELAY. SINCE I WILL HAVE TO SAND DOWN & FIX THE UNFLUSH WOOD PIECE MYSELF."""
3,dissapointed,"i ordered this cd,because i remember really liking the song ""here and now"".when i got to the song on the cd,im like ""what is THIS""??the added some techo to it,funked it out and ruined it.this isnt the version of the song youre seeking,and they should specify it on the description of the cd.i threw this out my car window"
4,used early draft as grad text,"I took a great graduate course from Prof. Andrews, way back in the 1970's, where his class lecture notes were titled ""To Truth Through Proof"", so I assume that was a very very early draft of this book.If so, this must be a very good book, because his notes were wonderful even back then."
4,Wahoo!,"This CD is good stuff! The music is strong (Elvis woulda been mighty proud). The politics are biting. Just what one expects from the Toadliquors. The cover of the Muddy Waters classic ""Got my Mojo Working"") is just plain exciting. And someone had to tell the truth about Princess Diana -- Mojo Nixon presents it quite well in his lyrics and singing for ""Drunk Divorced Floozie."" The CD closes with a surprising acoustic ballad -- ""When Did I Become My Dad?"" that isn't exactly gut-wrenching stuff, but is about as reflective as I ever expect to hear from a veteran punker."
5,Mojo Nation,"I bought this after hearing it on a listening station at Tower Records three years ago -- like receiving a revalation from a burning bush. I still listen to it as frequently as anything in my CD collection. Why? Because nobody does politically charged [tail]-rockin' hillbilly music like Mojo. Like all shamans, he's a madman......frothing at the mouth, winking at the audience, leering at the girls, laughing with the gods, screaming at hypocrites and power-trippers. Rasputin with an electrical guitar. His stuff would jump off the radio if anyone would dare play it, but they never will. Too dangerous."
5,Wow...,"I wasn't sure if I should get this CD, as I don't speak Italian, but I decided to, and I am so glad I did that it angers me to think that I almost didn't buy it because of the language barrier... when in reality good music surpasses it.i admit that this set is a bit pricey... but it's 100% worth it.Also, the fact that it's a live recording may throw you off... but think of it more as a greatest hits album, as the sound quality is surprisingly good, and there is a minimal amount of crowd noise.This CD is a must have for anyone that likes Italian music, or adult alternative/rock in general."
3,Great for Little Ones!,"My 16 month grandson loves this video. His attention span is naturally quite short, but he will watch most of this video and interact with it. I plan to get the others in the series."
4,Quirky,I really like this short lived series. It is unfortunate that its life was cut short. Season 2 had to rapidly wind up the story lines due to the show's cancellation but is still worth watching.
4,Pushing Daisies Season 2,"This is was a really great show with amazing creativity involved. The plots became kind of uniform after a while but the set designs, scenery, and acting were incredible enough to keep me coming back!"
4,"Great set, poor shipping","This show is really great! It's such a shame it was cancelled so early. The box did arrive broken, so the discs wont stay in the holder. The discs work fine though, so I have no intentions of returning it."
5,Pushing Daisies,This was a great series! It had subtle humor and the cast was just superlative. The special effects were nothing short of feature film quality (which is one of the reasons the show was cancelled... cost!). This is really one of those series that come around every decade or so that should have lasted for 5 or 6 seasons but due to the writers strike got shortened in the first season and never really got a fair shot before the series creator was off to a bigger success on another network. The writers were excellent and extremely gifted. I think this could be made into a highly successful movie.
5,Just as expected,DVD was received just as expected and described: brand new. Shipping was perfectly timed. I needed it as a last minute addition to my fiance's birthday and it showed up just in time (I was actually a bit late in ordering). My only complaint: There isn't a season 3 to buy from here.
1,Not a first choice for me,I just could not get interested in the characters. I found it to be very slow moving. Too much narrative
5,Wonderful Show,"Beautiful cinematography, easily likable characters, and a fun, lighthearted take on what could be a very serious premise. Really wish the show hadn't been canceled, and surprised that it was given the awards it was taking in beforehand."
5,amazing show sad it stopped,i love this show so witty and funny the characters are so amazing for the show they just fit so well.
2,"Some really clever and funny episodes, but...","Why is it that a tv series goes to the gutter for humor in the second or third season? I adored the first season of Pushing Daisies; it's the most clever, visually striking, and well acted show out there. But, they decided to start adding sexual-based humor in the second season and that turned me off. During the first season, this gutter humor was almost non-existent. Did they run out of good ideas? If you dig that type of humor, you might like it. But, I just don't think it's funny anymore."
1,deceptive manufacturer,"Don't buy from this deceptive manufacturer, their service is the worst I have ever had!I got the same model half year ago, and it is not working anymore! Their products will just last for a little longer than the warranty period.And, the wosre thing is their *customer service*. I called for help and they didn't try to answer you any question or ask you the details, but ask you to pay 19.99 for even answering some simple questions! In addition, they told me this is what their service should be. DON'T BUY from SONY AGAIN!!WORST EXPERIENCE ever!"
1,Suprisingly a bad Sony product,"I purchased this CD-RW drive and could not get it to work, the install did not work correctly, and the drive would get buffer underuns very often when burning CD's. I returned this drive and bought another USB cd burner and have not had any problems."
1,Pablo Snooze,"Yikes! The fact that these are the ""best"" songs should tell you something about the other songs on their albums. Pablo Cruise's music has not stood up to the best of time: slick, overproduced, and generic. If you're looking for good summer music, check out Jimmy Cliff, Andy Narell, Jimmy Buffett etc."
5,oldies but goodies!,"I love listening to the music of my youth. I had forgotten some of these songs, but recognized them as soon as they played. Good collection of songs and a great blast from the past!"
2,Past memories,I bought this as a reminder of the 70's music scene. There are only 2 or 3 good songs and the rest is a waste.
4,pleasant 70s memories,"This CD brought back some pleasant 1970s memories. Pablo Cruise was by no means a ground breaking band, or one that took a lot of chances. They were what they were; a good band dishing out melodic pop-rock tunes. All their hits are here, but for me the more interesting tracks are the instrumentals and extended jams on ""Zero to Sixty in Five"" and ""Ocean Breeze."" These two tunes show the band stretching out and showing off their musical chops and dexterity. I would have liked more long and interesting tracks like those, but hey, you gotta give the fans the catchy hits too. All in all a good collection."
3,Their best rocker is missing...,"I wanted to like this GH package, as it has a lot of decent tunes, but it's missing the only bonified rocker in their reportoire IMHO: Worlds Aways ""Runnin'."" Other than that, decent mix of their songs."
1,This is brutal!,"What a huge disappointment this is! I have about a dozen of the Millennium Collection discs in my house, and even though they're fairly skimpy, I've been quite impressed by the sound quality on these discs. This one bucks that trend, and more.I have never heard such poor sound reproduction on a disc that is supposedly ""24-bit mastered from the original master tapes"". It sounds like I've thrown a thick wool blanket over my speakers. I have ""Whatcha Gonna Do?"" on a compilation CD from the early 90s, and it sounds MUCH better on the old disc than on this one. Either the master tapes have deteriorated significantly in the last few years, or Jim Phillips (the poor schlup responsible for mastering this mess) has to go back to sound school.I would give four stars for the decent tunes (pretty much all the ones you would expect are there), but major deductions for lousy sound!"
1,Very Confusing,"I am sad to say that this book made no sense to me. I hope that the plot isn't time sensitive because at this reading, I am totally in the dark. But maybe that was the author's intention."
3,NOT THE BEST MY SCENE LINE,"I don't perfer this line. What's up with the ugly expressions? I saw the expressions in My Scene website. Soooo ugly! But I really like the Let's Go Disco line and I am thinking of buying Nolee and Madison pack. Overall, these Fab Faces isn't the best line but for the lovely clothes, crowns and the stuff, I gave it three stars."
4,"Good quality, smooth swing.",I purchased these for a 100 year old porch swing we had refinished. I also purchased springs to go at the top of the chain but after I installed these the swing was so smooth I didn't add the springs.
1,D.ROBINSON,"THIS MOVIE SUCKED, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.GOOD THING I CAN TRADE IN MOVIES WITH AMAZON.THIS WAS ONE OF DONNIE YENS WORST MOVIES.WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY."
5,"Yup, good purchase","Good price, good songs, fast delivery. Heard him sing ""You Can Take Me Home"" in a documentary about dog rescue. Can't believe I'd never heard it before. Great song, great message. Adopt a dog or cat and listen to some nice music with your new friend!"
4,nice home/wall charger for the 710,The 710 from Plantronics is great and does not come with a home/wall charger. It only comes with a charger that allows the unit to be charged from the computer only. I wanted to be able to charge it when away from the computer. The charger for the 510 works well for the 710 since it is so new and I am pleased.
1,Have Had Two Chargers Die - Don't Leave Them Plugged In!!,"The 510 is nice headset, but I have now had my SECOND charger die!! The original died, and the replacement worked for about 4 months.I keep it plugged in, like my other chargers, and connect the device when I am at my office. Apparently, leaving it plugged in will kill it eventually. Never had another charger die on me, and now two of these.I don't know who is making these things for them, but they are junk.I was a loyal Plantronics customer (all the way back 20 years ago then they made PC video boards), and wish my 510 had the micro-USB charger port like many headsets. Don't know if I should buy another charger, or buy a new headset that has a micro-USB connection. They should sell these in qualtity since they burn out like lightbulbs."
1,Bad customer service,I received the charger after I had ordered and received the headset....THAT CAME WITH IT'S OWN CHARGER!! Imagine my surprise as the website made it sound like i needed to purchase the charger seperately!! And trying to get it returned and credited was a nightmare!! I would not recommend buying from this vendor!!
1,Doesn't charge my 510,"I purchased a 510 headset a year ago and misplaced my charger. I ordered this one as a replacement, but it does not fit my 510 so I cannot charge it."
5,Glad it's inexpensive,"This charger is unique to the headset, so if you lose the original you have to replace it with this item. Nothing special, as long as it does what it's supposed to do I'm happy. I'm glad they are very inexpensive, so I bought a couple spares."
2,Loose Plug,Had high hopes for this to be a spare that I could take traveling but the plug that fits into the headset fits so loosely that the only way I can get the headset to charge is to prop something heavy up against the plug and pinch the headset against something else. Quite a disappointment.
2,An AC Adapter is not a Bluetooth Device,"I bought a replacement AC Adapter for my Plantronics Discovery 520 from this retailer because the price was excellent. When I discovered that the issue I had was with my headset and not the adapter, I looked into returning my new adapter, but was not permitted to do so. The retailer grouped AC Adapters in with bluetooth devices, which are not returnable. This was ridiculous to me and decidely not consumer-focused. I believe this is a policy meant only to benefit the retailer and most definitely not the consumer. I will not be purchasing from this online retailer anymore in the future."
1,Should have bought a car charger,"This was my mistake, I should have purchased a car charger since this 510 Headset charger was included in the box with the headsets I purchased."
3,Bendable please,Our daughter has had a lot of fun with this and it fits the mini castle that we have. Don't understand why they didn't make the doll knees bend to sit. We bought this less than $10.00 at Walmart don't know why it has to be so much on Amazon.Cute gift!
3,FYI,"FYI, for anyone reading these customer reviews, Peanut Butter Wolf is NOT an emcee, as these other reviewers state. He is a producer and DJ."
2,Not impressed.,I really was disappointed with these. They are quite large and fit oddly on my ear. Color not as I had hoped either...paler.
2,Mixed Bag,"While an entertaining look at the nosey world of apartment tenants with a promising heroine at its core, this books lacks any real suspense apart from its few startling surprises and gory details. It becomes quickly apparent who the killer is ..................."
4,Great Player no limitations!,"Plays all types of cds, haven't had any problems with cd-r's, great extra equipment for throwing cd's into your mixes!!"
1,Booooooorrrriiiiing!,"This CD is boring trash. I used to think 'Facelift' was good, but 'Dirt' is a terrible disc. The rhythms are way too slow and the guitar work is dull. I used to like AIC, but now I think they are extremely overrated. Especially Layne Staley. He doesn't play any instruments and doesn't write any of the lyrics, nevermind the music. The guitarist does all that, and he's not that good either. Go listen to Godsmack! They rule."
1,You got it,This group of people suck and any reject thats listening to this stuff is bad I want that dog Zack aka the 15 year old to shut up give the Beatles what you wan't but don't diss rap it is just as good as the Beatles.The Beatles will and will forever be over rated even thought they are good and the paper came out last week and said Mc Cartney is the best BeatleI HEARD SOME of this reject crap and said this truly sucks.
4,Hardly dusty,"I was always a JOF man myself, though it is obvious why Dirt is cited as the great grunger's finest moment. Capturing their rock at its melodically darkest with a well proportioned mixture, production work doesn't exactly elevate the album almost twenty years later, but the material itself for the most part is so tightly provocative in its alternative-rock context that it feels preserved in time and will never loose relevance."
5,Nothing compares.,"My musical tastes have changed over the years quite a bit, but Alice in Chains has always, and always will be, my favorite band. Every one of their releases are 5 star worthy, but this one is usually regarded as their best, and I would agree. Simply because EVER single song is great, there is no filler. There is a reason AIC still gets air time on the radio all over the nation, and if you like them even a little bit and don't have this cd, you need to get it now!"
5,Cathartic,"""Dirt"" was allegedly done while some of the group's members were wrestling with drug problems. I don't know if this was the case or not, but the songs and the intense music sure sound like the guys were working something out. In due time they did fine, though later Layne Staley got into some trouble. His partners in music are doing pretty well.The late Layne Staley's voice balances very nicely with the rest of the band's musicianship, especially that of Jerry Cantrell. I certainly don't get the idea that Alice in Chains was trying to make popular music but they were certainly making great music.If you are interested in this somewhat dormant genre of music ""Dirt"" is a fine addition to your collection."
4,Better than who?,"I see some talent in the music industry today,however, nothing can compare to the 90's, nothing can replace the impact the bands like AIC, STP, The Offspring, or Green day had. I love this CD and cannot believe that some people have the nerve to bad-mouth Layne for his habits, he is a true artist in my eyes and this CD reflects the pain his past, present, and future held. How ignorant people are today to talk crap when this artist died, anybody that died deserves nothing more than grateful recognition, they lived, they died just like everyone else. R.I.P. Layne."
5,Best Album Ever: without question,"This is not only Alice's best album but the best album ever released by one band. Every song is well thought out and very well played. The harmonization between Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell will continue to be imitated but never duplicated. No other musicians have ever been able to fuse such a complicated and unique style and also a kind of ""I wish i would have thought of that"" simplicity. From the hits that almost everyone has heard like ""Rooster"", and ""Down in a Hole"", to the songs that could've easily been number one hits had they been released, like ""Junkhead."" Alice in Chains helped to birth the revolutionary grunge style. They were pioneers that helped to bring about some of the most talented bands today. This album captures them in their prime."
3,Party all the time,"When I first heard this I thought it was like an advance release of the new Poison album. Really makes you wanna party hard like Poison. That being said, they don't quite have the looks of Poison. Still it makes you wanna put the top down on your convertible and drive down to the lake to check out the action. This album really gets you going but what it really needs is a party-all-the-time anthem to really get you going."
2,to all of you who said this band is better than Nirvana,"It's an opinion, you can't prove they were better. Don't forget, Kurt Cobain was the voice of the generation not Layne Stanley, who has the most whiney voice comparded to Kurt's screaming that actually fits in the genre grunge, so it's an opinion. Alice In Chains was good, Nirvana and Pearl Jam and Soundgarden were sooo much more influental.....and thats a fact"
1,Hw did they get popular???,"Any album you buy by AIC sounds the same so this is no exception. Songs all sound the same including black gives, Whiney as all hell vocals, and just typical poor me sad world grunge bs lyrics that fanboys find profound...."
1,so sorry,to all i didnt mean to post the same review twice i made a mistake and this review should settle it once again this was my bad!!!!!!
1,Horrible,"I bought this to give it a listen. To me it is horrible. Described by some as dreary and droopy, it sure is. Once was enough, it is off to the used cd store. A whole generation, if you will, grew up on this sorry state of music pushed by the record companies. At least I gave it a go. There is alot of other good music not so ""popular""."
1,Yawn! Give me real grunge like Staind any day of the week.,"So I decided to listen to this album because I heard it was an amazing grunge album. Man! I was so disappointed. It was simply awful. Not one good song on it. All of the songs sound EXACTLY the same- seriously, folks. The guitar riffs are unimaginative and uninspired and that Lane Stailey guy is a horrible singer. He sounds like a whining puppy or something! Listen to real grunge like Staind or Daughtry. Alice In Chains are lame post-grunge."
1,Badly reeks..........,"This music is tasteless. Nothing but plain old recycled 70's riffs w/ offbeat drums. The riffs are same as Led Zepplin's only they were a great and time-tested group. How come AIC couldn't release another very good CD like FaceLift? 'Sickman' is just that, sick. Songs like 'Dirt', 'Junkhead', 'Hate to Feel', and 'Rain When I Die' have way too slow rhythms and are boring. Layne Staley sounds like Beavis as Cornholio. If you want better grunge, go listen to Soundgarden."
5,Perfect,"I never really listened to Alice in Chains and ive always wanted to give them a listen. I popped Dirt in the player and I was blown away. They say no one is perfect but this cd is pretty damn close. The songs are well done and I love Layne's voice. The music really fits the music well. I really enjoyed the songs Dirt, Godsmack, Hate to Feel, and Angry Chair. I never really understood why Godsmack was called a rip off of this band but after I heard this cd I can see why. Its too bad Layne is gone but his music will live on forever. A must have for rock fans.A side note: VH1 ran a show called Best Songs of the 90's. I remember they said Alice in Chains were still touring. I think (I could be mistaken) but one of the band members said they are the same as before. Really? Id have to check that out. I dont think anyone can match Layne's voice."
5,"Ahhh, the memories this album bring...","A college staple for me, this album is amongst the best of AIC. Definitely a must buy."
4,The grungiest.,"As much as I love ""Jar Of Flies"", this is their best album. It's just track after track of pure meaty grunge. ""Nirvana"" were a bit more punk, and ""Soundgarden"" were a bit more metal, but ""Alice In Chains"" to me, were nothing but grunge, and ""Dirt"" is a perfect album title. This had a few huge songs, including ""Them Bones"", ""Rooster"", ""Down In A Hole"", and ""Would?"", which was also on the ""Singles"" soundtrack. Of course the other tracks on here rock just as much. ""Junkhead"" and ""Rain When I Die"" are two other favorites of mine. This band was always a little dark and mysterious, which is part of what made them special, and they are sorely missed. Fortunately, ""Jerry Cantrell"" continues to carry the torch."
5,A grunge essential,"This album is a grunge essential. If you have any respect for your CD collection, you'll pick this one up. I do not like Alice in Chains as much as I do Nirvana or Soundgarden, but this album is the essence of grunge, and is vital to the CD collections of anyone who likes loud guitar with cranked up distortion."
5,Tied with FACELIFT for best AIC album,"DIRT is as close to perfection as an album could possibly be. ""Them Bones"", ""Rooster"", ""God Smack"" and my favorite, ""Angry Chair"", are some of the best AIC songs. Not only that, but they're probably some of the best songs of 90'S ROCK! A must have for any Alice in Chains or grunge fan."
4,a must needs for metal fanz,"The first thing that drew me into this album was the virtuoso of guitarist Jerry Cantrell whose style is reminiscent of the greats in heavy (not hairband) metal, like Page and Hammett. The other factor driving me to become an AIC fan was Staley's voice. On this album in particular his high register makes the pounding metal rythmn more melodic (check out the chorus in ""junkhead"" homes). This album is a good choice for all those metal fans who like a powerful frontman with a high register, like Plant or Rose. ""Dirt"" also gets props for an innovative sound. For example, ""hate to feel"" is a hyper-blues piece that shows Cantrell's superb imagination by putting much life back into cliched blues riffs.The only problem with ""dirt"" is that the lyrics are extremely depressing, particularly the title track, making it hard to listen to all the way through, but whenever you need a kick in the pants listen to the first two tracks. If that don't raise your pulse, you must be dead."
4,Good,"Okay, first of all, I haven't heard all of this album, but I like everything I've heard off of it. Second of all, I have to say something about this comment on them being Godsmack ripoffs. This album came out way before Godsmack was even around, and it's backwards, the band is named after the song. Get the facts straight before you say something like that. Oh, and Alice in Chains is an awesome band. ""Rooster"" and ""Down in a Hole"" are wonderfully creepy. Godsmack is awesome too, but they took AIC's style, not the other way around. Peace, love, and all that stuff."
5,Great Album for a Great Era,"This Album is the definitive heavy metal album of the 90s. Sure AIC get labeled with the Grunge Genre but All AIC frans know that they're more metal than anything. Layne's voice sounds GREAT and Jerry's lyric writing is at its best. Buy this album if your an AIC fan, its a must have for any metalhead."
3,"Underated in thier time, overated now","Well, it's better than Godsmack, Staind, creed etc. But still nothing to write home about. They sound like a really depressing and droning version of Metallica to me (yeah i know everyone is anti-metallica now, but i meant it in a good way)."
3,Sludgy,"As far as metal / grunge goes, this is about as good as it gets though it's not the most progressive kind of music. All you people still obessing over this album, go listen to some rap. I would recommend Raekwon. Now that's music."
5,Great Buy,"I bought this for my boyfriend who is a serious record collector and musician. He was impressed by the quality of the product. I was grateful at how fast it was shipped, because it was a late buy for a present!"
5,Irony,"I thought you all may enjoy this little story....I was reading these reviews for one of the BEST bands ever when I ran across the idiotic statement made by ""I love fall out boy"". People should NOT comment on things they don't know about. It's annoying to those of us who do. Godsmack, of course, picked their name from the AIC song... however the irony in this whole thing is that as I was reading these comments today I thought the TRUE die hard AIC fans might enjoy the fact that I am wearing my Layne Staley memorial T-sheet that I purchased at the beach this year! In addition, and here is the irony, about 2 weeks ago I took my 15 year old daughter and 3 friends to see Fallout Boy, From First to Last, All American Rejects, and Hawthorne Heights. My daughter made me wear the Layne Staley t-shirt!!! I received many, many comments... Ironic huh??! Love to Layne and the remaining members of Alice in Chains!! P.S. I'm a rockin' 42 year old mom."
5,"Haunting lyrics, harrowing riffs, universal songs = CLASSIC","This album got me through high school. Period. Every tune on the album is so universal that they spoke to me in 1993 the same way the do in 2002. Dealing with issues such as Vietnam (The Rooster), agony of drug withdrawal (Junkhead) or f'ed up personal relationships (Down In A Hole)...this album kicks you hard in the stomach and doesnt let up until you are gasping for air on the last track. If you like the processed cheese bands out now like Nickelback, Creed, etc......buy some fromage....Alice in Chains DIRT."
4,Gotta like it,"I hope that people will buy this album. I just started listening to Alice in Chains, because I like my music depressing. And Alice in Chains gave that to me. Of course, ""Dirt"" contains the hit ""Rooster"", which is a great little song. The rest of the album rocks like a combination of Metallica and Pearl Jam. Some songs are weaker than others, but overall it's an album worth buying. ""Rooster"", ""Them Bones"", and ""Hate to Feel"" are the best songs on it."
3,Worth Checking Out,"This is an interesting book. Anyone who is interested in an alternative to the right wing talk radio and tv news should seriously consider checking out the Thom Hartmann radio show opposite Rush Limbaugh weekdays at: thomhartmann dot com / showlisten.shtmlWhether democrat, republican, or indepedent, so many of the facts out there are completely ignored by the mainstream media and talk shows. This show is one strong example of an examination of the facts regardless of your political affiliation."
4,"This was ""Joe Klein"" day on the radio","I saw Joe Klein at Politics and Prose bookstore in DC and today I heard him on at least 3 radio shows talking about his book. I am in the middle of it right now, and so far, so good. I don't always agree with Joe and his point of view, but I think he's onto some here.I long for the honesty of Robert Kennedy in today's politicians and Joe, while painting a depressing picture of today's politicians, gives me hope for 2008."
4,all about understanding RSA,"The book revolves around RSA. The motivation for the book is that the reader wants to understand public/private key cryptography, where this is represented by the seminal RSA algorithm.The author assumes little previous acquaintance with number theory on your part. He develops his arguments from this minimal background. So modular arithmetic is introduced, and thence such key ideas as groups, primality tests, Chinese Remainder Theorem and, finally, the RSA cryptosystem. Each chapter has a problem set of moderate difficulty.A maths undergraduate at the sophomore level or higher should be able to benefit from the book."
4,Good introduction to RSA,"I've used this book for teaching the basic theory of RSA cryptography. However, some knowledge of number theory is required in order to get full benefit of the text and exercises. I found ""Number Theory and Its History,"" by Oystein Ore, to be an excellent complement to this text.(Note that there are a few typographical errors in the exercises, but these are easily spotted.)"
4,Perfume Tree - Blue Stars,"The Perfume Tree song here is listed incorrectly. The song in the movie ""Weirdsville"" and the song available for download here is actually ""Blue Stars"" off the CD ""A Lifetime Away"", NOT ""Uneasy"" as is listed in the track listing."
1,Waste of My Time,"I find the material to be a minimalized version of the true tools based in quality lean material. As a practicing continuous improvment specialist i expected more than I got in this trivial account of what should be considered a very important event in a corporate life cycle.Designing products requires exceptional detail. Likewise I expect someone writing a book on the topic to provide exceptional tools and details. This book is superficial at best and points you in a direction, unfortunately it is the wrong direction."
5,An expert compendium of solid advice,"The Lean Design Guidebook: Everything Your Product Development Team Needs To Slash Manufacturing Cost by project management expert and consultant Ronald Mascitelli is a spiral-bound guide presenting eighteen practical tools for reducing manufacturing costs. From Six-Sigma Design to Value Engineering, Toyota's Production Preparation Process (3P), and much more, The Lean Design Guidebook presents metrics and tested methods for reducing waste, extensive checklists, step-by-step instructions, and much more. An expert compendium of solid advice."
3,A good book!,"This is a good book. It covers mostly on task managements and how to create value added time for PD engoineers, and do things more efficiently.It doesn't cover the knowledhe management part of PD."
2,137 Hours?,"I bought this item from this particular seller last fall (2007). I received the item quickly and without hassle, which was nice. My problem came later that year in November, when, after 137 hours, the lamp blew. Next, when contacting the seller about a replacement, the seller redirected me to BenQ, who then redirected me back to the seller. Long story short, I was unable to receive a new lamp after only having this one for less than a month. Use good judgment and discretion when deciding who to buy from. Hope this helps."
2,La ruta de Quijote,"Two highly recommended by hard to find books that do actually trace the Don Quijote trail are:""On the trail of Don Quixote : being a record of rambles in the ancient province of La Mancha"" by Augusto Floriano Jaccaci""Through Spain with Don Quixote"" by Rupert Croft-Cooke"
1,Buy this book and you won't respect yourself in the morning,"The Virgin Gardener opens with two pages of definitions for a rather arbitrary and off-putting list of garden-related terms. Then it's on to two pages for ""Designing Your Garden,"" two more for ""Growing Your Own Food,"" followed by spreads on ""Where and How to Buy Plants,"" ""Choosing Healthy Pants,"" and ""Essential Tools and Equipment."" WHEW!! With 20+ photos and assorted lists, there's not much room for the text, which is indeed elementary, but also uninformative. It relies almost totally on generalites and received wisdom that communicate little of real value.Sticking fanatically to the two-pages-per-topic structure, this book, like many for beginners, tries too hard to be comprehensive and ends up sacrificing clarity and accuracy. ..."
1,Difficult to understand,I took Prof Kwon's class and used this book. It was very difficult to understand. Bathe's book is much more clear.
4,Universal Trailer hitch,"This product is universal, that means adaptation is required along with the purchase of additional bolts , washers etc. If you understand that, it is satisfactory. I installed it on a 1990 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham RWD. It worked out great. Strictly light duty. I'm satisfied considering the low cost."
2,The Worst Beefheart I have heard,"The idea of Captain Beefheart selling out is ridiculous, he's the farthest out there ever was. Yet, he appears to be trying exactly that. It's not normal music, because it can't be, but damn if it doesn't TRY to be. Like a circus Clown that wants to be accepted and goes to the singles bar with a new suit and haircut, but can't quite get all the make-up off. Doesn't matter how good, even how GREAT, a clown he may be, you don't fit in with the yuppies. The title track is actually not too bad, once you get used to it. It's just not cosmic like the best of his stuff is. The Captain goes easy listening."
2,"Not Tragic, but the worst of Cap","nice... nice?! It's really not nice.Not a big musical relapse, it's perceptible on Uncoditionally Guaranteed. Most of the songs are unpalatable, except 'Observatory Crest'. 'Same Old Blues': good, but not particular, and it's a J.J.Cale song."
3,"Pop Beefheart is Bad, but not THAT Bad","I will not argue that this is anything like a great Beefheart album. I will simply quote the Virgin Records guy in the BBC Beefheart documentary who said, ""Even the weaker Beefheart albums are better than most of what was being released."" I also assert that this album is far better than Unconditionally Guaranteed. B&M still has irrepressible originality that is almost totally absent from the previous album. Observatory Crest is not a pop song with flying saucers, it's a flying saucers song trying to be pop. And that makes all the difference. It's an exercise in caging a beast, which can be as interesting as the unfettered beast. And the vocals are much stronger than subsequent albums (much as I love those albums)."
1,trout mask it ain't,"yes it's nice and melodic...and boring. what you really want to hear is trout mask replica and doc and the radar station. in this album beefheart goes commercial. but you gotta love him, a unique talent."
2,Oops.,This is not a real Beefheart album...it's a record company cash cow that failed. The Magic Band quit and all the music is played by studio hacks. This should be the last Beefheart album that you get.
2,Beefheart sells out!?!?!,"A lot of Cap fans refer to this as a sell out CD and for the most part I'd have to agree. Beefheart dishes out some tunes that can probably be best described as Miller Lite Bluez see ""Same Old Blues Again"", ""Captain's Holliday"", Cheezy Disco Funk Moves on ""Rock 'n Roll's Evil Doll"", Cracker Soul on ""Further Than We've Ever Gone"" and a positively wretched title cut that sounds as if it could have been written for Meatloaf. Horrible.The only reasons any Cap fan should own this is CD is to hear ""Party Of Special Things To Do"" (which you can already hear on the anthology ""The Dust Blows Forward"")."
2,It's like competition dish washing,"My oldest child begged me for this game for Christmas. I'm not sure why. I think my kids each took a turn with it on Christmas day, but they haven't touched it since then.If you are fascinated with stacking and unstacking cups as fast as you can, I guess this game would be just the thing. For us mere mortals, however, it has proven to be a complete bore.I'm giving it 2 starts because it seems to be well constructed, and I'm taking away three stars because it is boring and the cups all have holes in them so you can't even use them to drink out of once you've grown tired of the game."
4,A useful book,"This is a really good effort. I enjoyed reading the exercises, and I was pleased that there is finally something relevant to me here in Hong Kong.The business plan section was the best section, followed by the idea number 9.Its so easy to get negative - this is just as silly as being too positive during the boom of the internet. Mr. Khan reminds us of the basics, and unlike one of the previous reviewers, I can say that he is respected for being a straight talker in this part of the world.Readers of this book will be interested to note that all proceeds of the book are for the Karma Trust - another reason why this effort is different from so much that is written out here.The only thing to be aware of is petty minded reviewers with agenda's that are personal and not professional"
4,EXCELLENT COMPILATION BOX SET,"HERE ARE ALL OF RAY CHARLES' SONGS THAT HE RECORDED ON ATLANTIC RECORDS, BASICALLY IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. A GREAT BOX SET WITH INFORMATIVE BOOKLET. THESE ARE THE SONGS THAT MADE ALEGEND OUT OF A MAN. NO-ONE CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS PRODUCTION, BUT I DO FIND MYSELF LISTENING TO DISCS 2& 3 MORE THAN THE FIRST ONE. RAY'S EARLIEST RECORDINGS (Disc 1) ARE MORE LIKE IMITATIONS OF CHARLES BROWN OR FLOYD DIXON, AND THE LATER RECORDINGS ARE WHEN HE REALLY BECOMES ""BROTHER RAY""."
1,Dreadfullly boring!!!,"This DVD was a complete waste of my money. The images are passable but not spectacular. Any idiot could do what was done. You just place a camera on a tripod and let it run. I really don't like not being able to ""jump"" to a particular scene. It should have been marketed as a screensaver. I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase and cannot recommend it."
1,Too much serenity,This blu contains statics images from beautiful places.It cannot can be considered a real production.I waste my time and money.
2,Don't expect much,"If you are expecting to be transported to the beautiful locations, meet the people, find out about their culture etc or see the destinations with good hosts..then you are in for a HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!!This Blu Ray just puts a camera stationary or moving at each location & just leaves it there for a while. thats it!! no talk, barely any music..in fact Nothing but a view.so if you must show off your new blu ray system, buy Planet Earth.This one will be better for stores where the monitor is just left on..or maybe even some Spa"
1,Pretty Boring Picture,"Wow HD, BluRay, but the video is nothing more than a set shot of a location. No flying around, very little sound and absolutely boring. If you wanted to find out how a rock feels, then this is your video. Don't waste your money."
2,Total one side view,"This shows only the bad of the Clinton Family, obviously President Clinton did much good and this book only portrays his bad side, but that is what drove the man, gettin out of messes, this book is for the true right wingers who hate clinton, but if you are like me and belive President Clinton is a decent guy then dont buy this book."
1,No objectivity,"Totally one sided vendetta against the Clintons. How can anyone call Clinton ""the worst family"" when so many much more horrible presidents have been in office (look at Bush!). All presidents have done questionable deeds (even Clinton, our centuries best president) but you have to compare the harm they have done. For example, many people who support the Bush enviornmental policy (which harms untold millions if not billions of people) have been outraged at Clinton for getting a BJ! How absurd! Anything Clinton has done hasn't harmed a soul compared to what Bush is perpetrating. It's like comparing someone who stole a car to Hitler. Not to mention all the good Clinton did. Our country has NEVER been in better shape than in the two terms of President Clinton. This country has gone to the dogs in the few short months his term has been over."
5,Brilliant,"This is a fantastic book. Christopher Hitchens has X-ray vision when it comes to assessing Clinton and his corrupt administration. Christopher Hitchens for President, I say (I don't care if he's British!)."
3,An angry pamphlet that has--sadly--not lost its relevance...,"Bill Clinton is an extremely intelligent man, with a surfeit of charisma, and remarkable political acumen.He's also a pathological liar, woman-abuser, and war criminal...a sex-crazed sociopathic thug.Journalist Christopher Hitchens emphasizes the latter, not-so-flattering characteristics of our 42nd Chief Executive in this brief, angry polemic, which really should not be described as a book. (Hitchens recycles some of his past work on the subject in order to pad things out a bit.)It is, as one would expect per Hitchens, well-written, funny, profane, incisive, informative, and unsparing. Clinton-lovers won't like having their man lacerated with such thoroughness, and Clinton-haters will have their distaste reinforced. (Apolitical types won't care one way or the other, if they even bother to pick up the book.)"
4,A trenchant attack on a crook,"The great thing about Hitchens is that he's always on the front foot, always attacking. While this might occasionally lead him into overstatement, it's pleasing to see someone of the left unafraid to make an aggressive case against Clinton. His sobering -- but witty -- exposure of the President as a mendacious, hypocritical, and bigoted creep should be required reading for anyone interested in politics (which in a perfect world would be everyone). Despite what other reviewers say, Hitchens's ire is aroused not by the President's predilection for shady bedroom antics, but by his canting, offensive attacks on others when they engage in similar -- albeit less predatory -- activites. Although the book does display traces of having been composed a mite hastily, it's generally refreshingly vigorous, and always irreverent. Even those who disagree with Hitchens will be made to question their opinions about Bill."
5,Authentic Venom,"First things first: Christopher Hitchens is a masterful writer. His gift for polemic is unrivaled in modern journalism. In 'No On Left to Lies To,' Hitchens teaches the vast right wing conspiracy how to really take shots at the President (one does not fault them for their choice of targets; one faults them for their aim). As Hitchens shows, Monica Lewinsky may have been seduced, but the American people have been suckered. Most appalling is the Clinton self-pity that masquerades as depth, or turmoil. The Demander in Chief cares only for himself, and Hitchens shows how this selfishness colors all of his actions. An ostensible liberal, Clinton's personal admiration for the Bill of Rights seems only to extend to 5th Amendment. He did more to undermine the Constitutional protections of privacy and speech than Bush and Reagan ever could have dreamed. Above all, Hitchens reminds us that the lesser of two evils is still evil."
5,"EYE opening! Clear, concise, brilliant and scathing.","Being a woman and having voted for Clinton twice, I have toadmit it has been difficult to accept that our reverred leader is aself-serving sexist pig who has used the woman's movement as brilliantly as he has used the race card and gay movement. I think his betrayal of women far out weights his other broken promises to gays and African-Americans. It is the women he has thrown on the street, disparaged, disenfranchised, disrespected, maligned, raped and viciously deceived. The future for all looks pretty bleak."
4,An Attack from the Left,"Most of the books demonizing the Clintons came from the right. Hitchens is different because he crticizes them for abandoning values held dear by the left.Lying under oath in a sexual harrassment trial, ending welfare as we know it and compromising gay rights with a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy indicates to the author that the most important value to the Clinton is not the core democratic principles, but the raw pursuit of power.He details the evidence that Bill was likely guilty of rape, likely multiple times, and how his distraction on these moral issues impacted his judgment in critical foreign affairs decisions. He indicates that Hillary was not only facilitating but actually managing the smear campaigns against victims that may come public.His picture is one of arrogance, never accpepting any repsonsibility for their actions, always having someone to blame- and a rapacious thirst for power at any cost, unrestrained by principle or integrity."
4,Discussion of the Business of Lying Sets This Book Apart,"Hitchen's writes about what I and others have known about Clinton for ages: under the pretense of the noble causes he (and his wife) embrace, the only people who have advanced in any real way are (surprise!) the Clintons.What's refreshing about this book is that a professed lefty has carefully dissected the subtle method of lying and hypocrisy of the most two-faced administration in American political history. A short but fascinating look at a real scoundrel."
4,About Time!,"I think Christopher Hitchens has applied the spanking President Clinton has long needed. I'm a registered Independent who tends to vote for Democrats so this is not a partisan issue. I simply believe Hitchens has exposed this President for what he is, some who doesn't belong in the White House. When Republicans act in the same fashion, I would hope that writers of good will on the other side would expose them as well. Though short, this book packs a good deal of information that one might have to search long and hard elsewhere to find."
3,"if you hate Clinton this book is,how you say- a great read!","Christopher Hitchens, the madman from Limerick or Glouster or whatever, has written another of his angry, sociopathic rants and the world is once again indebted to his publishers, who have shown great foresight in humoring this demented Londoner by marketing his paranoid tirades, thereby averting another horrific terrorist shooting spree or bombing which could very possibly have been perpetrated by this Liverpudlian lunatic.In his ""..Triangulation of William...Clinton"", Hitchens continues the tradition of making deranged allegations of mass-murder, child sex-slave trafficking, castrations of political opponents, devil-worship, etc., which he started in his venomous and strangely erotic 1987 essay about Mother Teresa, ""Missionary Position.""As others who share Hitchin's inordinate hatred for Clinton would say, this book is a great read."
1,Nothing New Under the Sun,"Christopher Hitchins adds nothing new to the tired if valid attacks on Clintons character in this (very) thin volume that's more a harrangue in the form of an essay than a book. I used to admire Hitchins, but now his anti-Clinton rage comes off as obsessive as it is naive: Can you believe our president lied to us? Um . . . yes."
3,the truth--plain and non-simple,all the facts are here but my criticism of hitchens' style of writing is that the reader has to be very familiar with his subject matter already otherwise the authour overwhelms you with so much scathing information about his subject matter. Christopher is an important journalist but after a while youy dont hear him anymore because he is so vengeful. I wish he could incorporate a more emotional style of writing so that I could 'feel' what he 'feels'.
4,Self deception on an unprecedented scale,"I wanted to read this, because of Mr. Hitchens sharp wit. I do not disagree with Mr. Hitchens in his appraisal of the Clintonoids, including, and especially, the two main characters. In the continued debasement of our great Republic, his dead-on vision of the conservative capitulation to ""the liberal line"" on how to proceed with the impeachment issue, as well as any other issue, is a great observation. This valuable little book should be read by anyone who is interested in seeing the epitome of ""zero-worship"". I would also recommend to your attention, the book ""The Ominous Parallels:The End of Freedom In America"" by Leonard Peikoff as a way to reverse the cultural trend toward dictatorship, especially with Czar Hillary at its head."
4,The real truth of the Clinton regime,"Hitchens, with his usual pomposity, hits the nail on the head in his book ""No one left to lie to"".It's refreshing to see that some ultraliberal democrats are able to see past all the lies and media spin of this administration. And even more amazing is that Hitchens is willing to write about it."
5,A lacerating indictment of a fiendish womaniser,"This book no doubt polarises everybody who reads it: those who pick it up expecting a biographical will no doubt be incensed by its unapologetic laceration of its subject, while those who accept that it is not a biographical but an account of the subject's worst attributes and deeds will gorge on its contents in slovenly delight. Bill Clinton's lies and crimes are exposed in a style very seldom employed by other writers. It is a testament to the investigative and perceptive powers of Hitchens, to write something so outrageous against a person and not be sued for slander - a fact that no doubt adds further weight to the described crimes and lies as truths"
3,Wonderful Writng Style!,Enough on Bill Clinton ... I'd be interested in your investigation of the Bush Family.
1,Blatant bias hangs Hitchens,"This is not a review of this book but rather a review of Mr. Hitchens. He is not shy about expressing his utter contempt and hatred for the Clintons as he did on Larry King. How can anyone take this book seriously? Even if what Mr. Hitchens says is accurate, and I would assume that most of it is, why would anyone cast his or her ""economic vote"" (trans: pay money for) a book that fosters hate? Unless, of course, you like hate. I don't and won't."
2,Difficult read,The book is a difficult read due to the author's command and use of words to explain the subject.
3,Super wordy,Sincerely the information could be good but the author is extremely wordy at times. Hitchens sounds pedantic without too much bones...
3,Christopher versus Peter - The Hitchens conflict,"1- 0 to Peter.I have read a few of Peter Hitchens books and always found them to be superbly well written, thought provoking and well informed. Thought I would try some of his brothers books to compare ‘the other side!‘Whilst I found the book equally as informative, I felt that the style of writing was less compelling than his brothers so in comparison I score 1-0 to Peter after my first Christopher book. Looking forward to getting stuck into the next."
5,Might be the greatest book ever written . . . BUT,"I'll never spend one cent on anything such a virulent and biased person, that's you Hitchens!, writes."
1,"Lefties eat their own, Cons never speak ill of each other.","Christopher Hitchens' new book is a sterling example of the Left's tendency to attack those who are closest to them in ideology, rather than using their energy to fight their real enemies. Hitchens attackes Clinton for a host of behaviors, but few of Hitchens' attacks have to do with Clinton's actions in his official capacity. Instead, Hitchens focuses on sex - blithely ignoring the far-worse transgressions of Clinton's Republican foes on this issue."
1,"Biased ravings from a nasty, driveling lunatic","The book is filled with erros by omission. For example, Hitchens argues that the raids on the Sudan and Afghanistan were intended to distract from Clinton's impeachment problems. But he never addresses the most important part of Clinton's rationale: the believed meeting of the terrorists. Hitchens never denies that the CIA told Clinton that this was his best opportunity to get Bin Laden's organization. If that really was the intelligence, the timing of the raids cannot be faulted. Hitchens hides the problems with his arguments through the use of rhetorical flourishes and witty wordplay."
1,Garbage! Who IS this revolting fellow ?,"Why do Americans insist upon dismembering their presidents ? Here in Great Britain we are accustomed to the rather rough handling or our PM in the House of Commons, and in the less reputable papers, but we've seen nothing compared to what Mr. Clinton has endured. I must say, I only made it some 75 pages through this 'book' before I tossed it aside and went out for a pint. I humbly suggest to my friends on the other side of the pond to forget these rabble-rousers that slander Bill Clinton with impunity and read something uplifting about your great nation for a change, like ""The Greatest Generation"" or ""The Triumph and the Glory."""
1,"True to Form, Mr. Hitchens","Christoper Hitchens will do absolutely anything for a buck. He betrayed friendships, mucked and fudged everything he could.. misappropriated, distorted, misinterpreted, cunningly edited, told half truths, and made a fool of himself on the talk show circuit making & promoting this book. But Bill Clinton is only the latest victim to produce visions of golden sugar plums in Mr. Hitchens' mind.. his last expose of Mother Theresa as dictatorial con artist should give the reader a hint of the odd, money besotted, delusional character of Hitchens' work."
5,I'm bequeathing this to my children,"To all you people out there who feel that President Clinton has been wronged, the victim of a conspiracy, the greatest president in our country's history, I am saving this book for the future. Because I know that as the years roll by and the crimes laid at the man's door begin to pile up, you will all claim you never voted for the man and protest loudly you didn't know, like so many Auschwitz oven operators. You have no excuse now. Hitchens has robbed you of it. This book only proves what everyone knows deep down: Clinton is an incubus who is sucking the life out of both left and right. When the Democratic party is lying lifeless because he has prostituted every pure thought, and the Republican Party is strangled of all it's initiative because of stolen ideas, watered down, this nation will have no choice but to point the finger squarely where it belongs, at the Slickmeister's perjurious nose. Read and weep."
5,Not just another Clinton book,"This book is brilliantly written, acerbic and right on the money. Hitchens has a jeweler's eye for the infinite ways in which Clinton's hypocrisies have diminished us all. Having this book as a permanent piece of the public record may be the worst punishment Clinton will endure."
3,A lot of anger; how much reasoning?,"Hitchens' has been appearing on radio programs of late to promote this book, and I caught one such program this morning. To be frank, even thought I agree with some of what he has to say, his tone was so full of hatred, anger, and know-it-all superiority that I was completely repelled. I kept hearing a line from ""Broadcast News"" over and over in my head as Hitchens continued to spray his invective and vitriol: ""It must be nice to always know better, to know that you're the smartest person in the room.""If you are looking for a well-balanced, dispassionate, factual discussion of the pros and cons of Clinton and Clinton policies, look elsewhere. If you are after hate-filled invective, this is the book for you. Personally, that much hatred and anger repulses me, but your milage may vary. (And when I say ""hate-filled,"" I am not employing hyperbole. Hitchens himself, in his interviews, says that he hates Clinton, and invites others to do so as well.)"
3,Dr.Pygmalion is a funny old book,"This is the autobiograpy of Dr. Maxwell Maltz, creator of Psycho-Cybernetics.I knew him personally and always wanted to read this book, which has been out of print for many years. It was written before he developed Psycho-Cybernetics, so no self help insights will be gleaned from it's pages.I think Dr. Max blended some fiction with his facts, but all in all it is a fun read, and details much of his life and work.After waiting so many years to read it, I was a bit disappointed, but if you can get a copy that isn't falling apart, and you are interested in Dr. Maltz, I would recommend it to you."
5,JT MONEY KICKS,"Hey all. Man JT Money kicks! I can't get enough of hearin' ""Who Dat"". Man...once he finishes the cd with this on it...then it will really kick. What can I say...JT Money ROCKS DA HOUSE!"
3,Why oh Why the fullscreen!!!!!,These movies are childhood favorites. I was disappointed when Police Academy on DVD was fullscreen. So I was excited when the 7 movies were slated for widescreen DVD release. To my horror I found out after I bought them that 4 and 5 are fullscreen. Shouldn't this be a matching set. I have a widescreen TV and having two of the movies in this set in fullscreen is intollerable. I would like to find the person who made that decision and give him or her a battery acid enema. All I can say is that Warner Brothers had better rerelease those two in a widescreen format.
5,Best collection ever!!!!!!!!!,"Excellent collection, I think that the DVD's are masterized because the image is almost perfect, like if you were watching a movie of today. ALL the movies are really fun and excellent. The only thing bad that this collection have is that it does not include audio in spanish, only English and French, but at least it have spanish subtitles. I REALLY RECOMEND TO BUY."
3,"Great, Funny Movies But Bad Packaging!",I like the Police Acadamy movies and find them hilarious and I was happy to hear that they put out a boxset that included all of them but I'm disappointed with the packaging. I think it's weird that some of the movies are shown in the origial widescreen aspect ratio and others in the pan and scan format. I would have preferred alll widescreen. They should have put out an all widescreen set for people like me who like the theatrical aspect ratios and a fullscreen set for the people who for whatever reason like their movies edited into the pan and scan format
4,Some Folks Just Don't Get It...,"Not going to spend any time here reviewing the movies, we all know what they're like. I just wanted to say to the folks complaining that the films do not accurately portray actual Police Academies have missed the point completely: In the first minute of the first movie, the titles state very plainly that the new mayor has done away with all restrictions on applicants to the Police Academy. Absolutely no one could be turned away. Fat, weak, dumb, short, timid, crazy, old... anyone was eligable. The point of the movies -- if they have a point -- is that ""this"" is what happens when you indiscriminately let just anybody off the street in the Academy. I guess after 7 movies some people forgot what they were watching."
4,good,I have greatly enjoyed the DVD's I have viewed(2) @ this time.For the money I feel it is a good purchase
2,Mono?,"I was watching Police academy 6 from this box set today and all the audio is coming out of the center channel. After a quick check of my cables and other DVDS it appears they mixed this movie down to one channel. Oh well at least *THIS* one is in widescreen. As someone else said, I've never seen a box set with this many flaws but if you're a fan of Police academy what other choice do you have?"
2,Police Academy The Complete Collection,"We were not aware that there are two versions out there for Police Academy, that one of them is racy, and that ours we received from you is the ""racy"", ""R"" rating on the first video and PG-13 rating on the others in the set. We'd watched them at our friends' home they'd picked up here and there, and there was NO nudity in them and didn't know there was more than one version. In the first one that was rated ""R"", there was nudity, and in the second one rated 'PG-13' it was just as ""racy""as the ""R"" one. It should've been mentioned that there are two versions and what version you have available. We canNOT share them with any of our friends because of the offensive material in them.Please comment back to me."
3,set was ok,i got this for my wife she kept asking if i had ever seen them and i haven't. so i finally purchased the entire set and it was OK. very predictable movies once you watch the first one.
2,"Don't buy this for ""Green Onions""!","""Green Onions"" is a great song--a song that sounds thrilling no matter how many times you've heard it. Unfortunately, the ""Green Onions"" album isn't nearly as exciting and gets kind of tiring after a listen or two. This was the MG's first album and was recorded after the 45 of ""Green Onions"" hit the top of the charts. The inventiveness and fire evident on the ""Green Onions"" single is just about impossible to find on the other tracks of this album, though. If you were thinking of getting this so you could hear ""Green Onions""--well, don't do it. Pick up ""The Very Best of"" on Rhino. It has ""Green Onions"" and about 17 other songs that are just as thrilling. Then, if you want to have more MG's material, pick up ""Hip Hug-Her"" or ""Soul Limbo"" or the ""Time is Tight"" Box set. This album is one that only completists will want."
2,Weak overall - but some good bits,"Despite the magic of the title tune, this album shows signs of having been rushed out as a cash-in. The choice of material is poor, and the interpretations are somewhat uncertain. If you must own 'Green Onions' (the tune), get it on a compilation, and spend your Booker T & the MGs budget on one of the later albums (which are utterly brilliant...)."
5,GreenOnions!,"Got this for my dad for father's day simply for the song green onions. which is really the best song on this album, but well worth the buy!"
5,"Booker T.'s fine, fine debut","This is just to dispute the customer reviews that write this 1962 album off as being useless save for the title song. It's listenable through all 12 tracks, and at least half of those will embed themselves in your memory as deeply as ""Green Onions"" if you give them chance. This is a band that was subtle even when it was showing off its formidable chops. The slow, bluesy takes on songs like Doc Pomus' ""Lonely Avenue"" and Ben Tucker's ""Comin' Home, Baby"" are wee-hours classics. These guys were so good, they even make ""Stranger on the Shore"" sound sexy."
2,opinion,"The device works to some extent..1. Instructions lousy.. very little detail(assume intentional) 2. Test mode is a no-go,does not work and frankly don't know if was ever intended to. 3. With 10 min of trial and error you can get device to work ie you dial nimber, hang up, turn on, it calls then sets itself, after 60 seconds or so it will detect motion/heat(within perhaps 20 ft. and dial previously dialed number nearly without fail. 4. Microphone is acceptable at best--it will pick up loud talk or banging around. Worth $45 not really. $25 yes."
3,False Alert if Power goes and comes back on,"This product is a nice invention, and it works as it is designed to. The only problem that I have with it is that if for any reason, the unit loses power, when power returns it will send you a call. Hence, if you live in an area that is prone to power outages, you will be getting a call from it each time power returns to it. This can be a worrying experience. So what do you do? Well the best thing is to have your neighbor's phone number handy so that you can verify if there was a power outage in the area.This unit can also be defeated if either power and/or the phone lines are cut to your premises before the intruder enters. Ideally, this unit needs to be upgraded with at least a 24-hr battery back up supply of power and maybe a GSM wireless phone capability."
5,"quality good, but almost late","I was starting to get worried. This item arrived on the last day in the allowable range. But the quality is good, and the item was not late."
1,Absolutely pointless,"With so many other Who compilations out there, all with longer track listings and more comprehensive song selections, you really don't need this disc. Save your money."
1,The Who Deserves Better Than This Deficient CD,"If you want the best of the Who, buy Who's Next and Quadrophenia, then My Generation, The Best of the Who. This collection is an insult to one of the greatest groups of all time and reduces their career to a few songs. Their career has meant so much more than just the few songs on this CD. They were one of most intelligent bands of their time and the best to listen to, especially in the early 70's. If you buy this CD and stop here, you are cheating yourself and will never have an understanding of what the Who are about."
4,Good for newbies,"This CD is great for people who are new to The Who, and who don't want to spend too much money on a CD. All you Who fans are complaining, but this isn't directed toward the already dedicated fans (at least I hope not) who own some of their albums already. This is geared toward those who are new to The Who, and who want to get a good idea of their sound. The song choice is decent, with some great songs on it (although I agree that some of them could have been replaced with better ones), but the CD serves its purpose very well. So stop bashing it. If you're a dedicated fan of The Who, why are you bothering with greatest hits collections anyway?"
2,"Won't Get Fooled Again (In fact, I never was fooled in the first place!)","Out of all the Who's millions of compilations, this has got to be the weakest. The problem is evident when you look at the track list - a mere ten songs - not to mention the amount of key tracks that are missing, even obvious favorites such as Substitute, Baba O'Riley, 5:15 (or anything from the masterful Quadrophenia), the Seeker, Boris the Spider, Call Me Lightning and You Better You Bet, not to mention the slew of good album tracks that the band put out (Acid Queen, Go to the Mirror Boy, Song Is Over, Gettin' In Tune, Going Mobile, Punk & the Godfather, Dr. Jimmy, Slip Kid). So skip this and go with the aptly-titled Ultimate Collection."
3,Not Enough,"This album is pretty decent for a casual fan of rock or someone who does really no much about the who. However, for most true fans this greatest hits is to small. I, myself, have never been a big fan of the 20th Century millenium collection CDs only because they take really good bands and try to but all of their hits into a 10 track CD. For bands like the Who, and most other big name calssic rock bands, yuo can't have a single CD for greatest hits. In conclusion, the CD is way to small."
2,I almost got fooled again!,Thank God for .... A place where folks can check out what the right cd is to buy. I was at wal-mart which is the only place to buy cd's near where I live. This cd really caught my eye and if I would of had enough money when I was at Sam's I would of gotten it. I then went to ... to see the other cd's of The Who. buy MY GENERATION THE VERY BEST OF THE WHO. It is a lot better then this piece of... and if you're lucky you can get it the the same price. The liner notes are great because they give tidbits of each song including chart postion with different members talking about the song. I'll bet that in a few years most of these unessential millenium cd's will be out of print.
2,"Not the ""best"" by a long shot...","While I haven't listened to this particular album I have listened to all the songs it contains and it in no way represents the best of The Who. Don't get me wrong, they are all good songs, in fact they were all chart toppers in their time. But that's the problem. Any band that is not mediocre always has better songs than the ones that make it to the top of the charts and The Who is not a mediocre band. They are one the ten best rock and roll bands in all history. Quadrophenia isn't even represented...which kind of says it all. The quality and range of The Who is badly misrepresented by this ""Best of"" compilation..."
2,Readers Digest Who,"The Who in abbreviated form. Pete was always afraid of being remembered for writing a half dozen songs and these are that half dozen. Does not show the majesty, the wit, or the power of the Who. Better to get the ""My Generation"" hits album, ""Who's Next"", ""Quadrophenia"", ""Live At Leeds"", or anything else in the Who catalogue rather than this budget hits album. Nice pictures, though."
1,Have to agree..,"There's better WHO cd's to spend your hard earned dollar on.""I won't get fooled again! Yaaaaaooooow!""8^)"
2,Not the Who disc you're looking for,"If you are thinking about buying this cd, please read this first. Being an exceptionally great band, I don't believe that this disc is a true representation of the Who's ""greatist hits."" While it does contain songs which are truly near to my heart--Won't Get Fooled Again being one of them--the album seems more of a attempt to earn a profit by cashing in on the millenium craze than a true record for the consumer. Sure, there are some absolutely great songs here (this being the only reason I didn't give it the minimum one star), but there is simply too much left out and overlooked to be a true compilation of their best. If you are new to the Who, try the My Generation--the Very Best of the Who disc instead. It contains many more songs which I believe give the listener a better idea of what these guys were all about. Trust me, I started out with that album, and now I'm absolutely hooked."
1,Don't Get Fooled Again,"Don't get me wrong. This is 10-star music. But MCA executives should be publicly flogged for its obvious money-grubbing 20th Century Masters series--especially when it comes to one of the most anthologized bands in rock history.For casual Who fans looking for a career retrospective collection, here's one reason to buy this CD: ""Behind Blue Eyes."" Here's eleven reasons to buy My Generation: The Very Best of the Who: You also get, ""I Can't Explain,"" ""Anyway, Anywhere, Anyhow,"" ""Substitute,"" ""I'm a Boy,"" ""Boris the Spider,"" ""Pictures of Lily,"" ""The Seeker,"" ""Baba O'Riley,"" ""Let's See Action,"" ""5:15"" and ""You Better You Bet.""Don't celebrate the new millennium by wasting your money on an inferior anthology."
1,What ? Another Who best-of?,"First and foremost I must say that I am a fan of The Who. Now,don't we all agree there are far too many best-of packages for The Who ?Stick to any of their original albums featuring Keith Moon.Then treat yourself to the expanded edition of ""Live At Leeds"" or their ""Live At the Isle Of Wight 1970"" disc,if it's still available. Just avoid rehashed cash-ins like this 20th Century thingy. Thanks,bye."
2,Lousy Collection,"The Who made some really great music, but by listening to this collection, you wouldn't know it. Well, of course there's Magic Bus and My Generation, excellent music there, but why not add a tune like Sparks? I agree with the above reviews, this CD is simply lacking."
3,I Can't Explain,"Why are so many hit songs from the Who missing on this CD? ""I Can't Explain,"" ""Baba O'Reily,"" ""The Kids Are All Right,"" and other hit songs are all missing. If you're a die-hard fan of the Who and this is the only CD you don't have, go ahead and buy it. But if you're new to the Who, here's what to do: get ""Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bouncy"" and ""Who's Next."" Those two CDs offer what really is the best of the Who. I call that a bargain, the best I ever had."
1,Baba O'Riley?,"""Baba O'Riley"" is stilled played on the radio today. It was one of the first songs I heard from in the 90s when starting to listen to music. How could this be left off?""Going Mobile"" and ""The Seeker"" would have been good too. But just adding Baba O'Riley could have elevated this to 3 or 4 stars. Without it, it's nothing. Instead of buying these ludicrous ""Millennium Collection"" albums, spend a few minutes to find real best of compilations for any artist you are interested in."
2,ONE PROBLEM ON ONE SONG,PROBLEM WITH COMPLETIONS ON THE WHO IS THEY DID NOT PUT THE LONG VERSION MAGIC BUS ON ANY OF THEM. ON THIS NEW COMPLETION THEY COULD OF PUT THE LONG VERSION MAGIC BUS ON IT THAT WOULD PUT THINGS A LITTLE BETTER ON THIS COMPLETION. SORRY I HAVE TO BUY THE 1983 THE WHO'S GREATEST HITS.
3,Torrando meu salário,"Coletneas. O colega aí embaixo descreveu bem: este, a exemplo de uma série de outros discos, serve para tirar dinheiro dos idiotas. Acaba no sendo o meu caso, mas se eu ganhasse a grana que Pete Townshend recebe de direitos autorais, eu compraria este disco facilmente. Para os consumidores: prefiram os originais."
1,sux,"This whole Millenium Collection series sux. They give the bare minimum in every way. It's just a quick way to make a buck. Boycott the entire series, every album until it goes away and they give us something worthwhile."
4,"If you have only ""albums""","For the older listeners out there - I think this is a good collection - ""remastered"" means better sound. I have several Who ""albums"" and I don't listen to them much anymore. This is a nice all around CD to give me a chance to hear some of the old hits again."
1,Who Needs Money,"For a group that has only 11 studio albums, they have at least as many ""greatest hits"" collections. This is yet another attempt to reap money from the stupid. Here's the list so far of previous rip-offs: Meaty-Beaty-Big & Bouncy, Who's Greatest, Hooligans, Who's Better-Who's Best, Maximum R&B;, The Who Collection, My Generation- The Very Best of The Who, and this one.No greatest hits package could ever be complete, so stop trying. Just get their original albums. Start with Who's Next if you're a nubie. You won't be disappointed.[DW]"
2,Another cheap record company moneymaker.,"This disc is a really really big waste of money, considering the Who have released six or seven hits sets you could do much better than this. The set is no less than a psaltry collection of songs that are considered ""mega hits"" and would bring shame to any bandthat calls itself the ""greatest rock and roll band in the world"". There is poor documentation of the bands early years or late years. The linear notes were terrible and uninforminative.The music wasn't bad, but the package was."
2,The Who's Ungreatest Hits....,"I must admit the only reason why I bought this album was because I was curious to see what The Who were all about. Having not known very much about them, I was disappointed to find that this album did not include some of their most famous songs (many of which I heard on the radio). If you are a big Who fan or are curious about exploring their music, I would recommend buying a more comprehensive greatest hits album."
2,I almost got fooled again!,Thank God for Amazon.com. A place where folks can check out what the right cd is to buy. I was at wal-mart which is the only place to buy cd's near where I live. This cd really caught my eye and if I would of had enough money when I was at Sam's I would of gotten it. I then went to Amazon.com to see the other cd's of The Who. buy MY GENERATION THE VERY BEST OF THE WHO. It is a lot better then this piece of crap and if you're lucky you can get it the the same price. The liner notes are great because they give tidbits of each song including chart postion with different members talking about the song. I'll bet that in a few years most of these unessential millenium cd's will be out of print.
1,biased author wendy doniger,"If you would like to read about how to denigrate hinduism, wendy doniger is your woman. She has in all her books insulted hinduism. Her lack of intellectual background or cultural understanding and pure racial bias are very obvious in her writings."
5,A really good turntable,I purchased this to replace a B&O; Linear tracking turntable. The cartridges for that turntable cost $400.The product came complete with cartridge and stylus. It was easy to set up. I have used it for about 20 hours and it sounds great with my system.I highly recommend this product.
2,Functional,"I bought these because I really wanted them for my car to help keep it cooler while at work without having to worry about rain getting in the car. The price was a lot cheaper than I could find anywhere else and the functionality of the product is fine. The aesthetic of them was not so great. The edges of the shades were very sharp whereas a more expensive one would have the edges rounded and would not look so rough. The lines on the shades are also very bumpy. Just looking at them you can tell this. It seems like these might be factory seconds, or thirds even. The shades work fine, but they look horrible compared to others I have seen."
3,"For the ""Arts Bizarre"" Fan","While this is a wonderfully creative production, it is certainly not for children and the graphic genitalia on the doll and suggested elsewhere, and behaviors of some dancers, may not be your ""visions of sugar plums dancing..."" That said, definitely worth a watch, and if you are a friend of the bizarre, a purchase."
1,Buyer beware,"Stay away from this DVD!! This is NOT ballet! Any ballet that was done was pathetic. It was NOT even a creative version of performing the Nutcracker, like Pacific Northwest Ballet's Nutcracker movie. The battle scene music & snow scene music was used numerous times. You will hear the same score over & over again & wonder if they are going to use the nationality music. They finally do. Of the nationality ""dances"" - the only one worth watching was ""arabian."" It was a juggler tossing three rings & then tossing five rings on a ladder as seen at circuses. The sometime sexual movements between various partners I found inappropriate-especially for children. This is a 90 min movie - my family & I saw it in less than 30 min. It was such a disappoint to all us, especially the children - who the movie was intended. If you are looking for a Nutcracker, stay away from this one."
1,Not For Children!,This ballet terrified my daughter and I just want to warn parents this one's definitely NOT for children! I found (the little bit that I saw of it) rather distasteful myself. Maillot has taken something that for many people has been traditionally a magical and enchanting part of the holidays and cheapened and degraded it with this twisted version.
4,Classy,Love this watch. The metal strap looks very classy plus the Tommy Colors are very distinct. Got $ 20 off also with the Amazon promotion. Good Buy.
5,Great Find 1,"I purchased this watch to wear it for my everyday needs. It has so far worked really well. I always get compliments regarding this watch. So, again I am really happy with the purchase."
4,unique Modell,"the watch is different than the others watches on the market. It fits to different clothes, especially if wear Jeans or causal."
1,Save your money....,"Made in China, I've had in about 30 days and the Stainless Steel,(LOL) is rusting.When am I going to learn to look at the country or origin each time?"
4,Nice buy,After I bought this I was proud of my purchase.. Value for money. Knife edge is sharp. Only thing I want to see is whether these knives ever needs sharpening or not..
4,good value in cuttlery,"The International Forged Synergy line of knives is considerably less expensive than other products from J.A. Henckels, but performs very well. It is a pleasure to use this high quality knife. I recommend it."
4,Delightful,"The poems seem to be well written, accept for some spelling errors? Which I hope they will correct, I found the poetry to be delightful and exciting. The writer took you with him to place and times in his life. Some of his writing style was strickly from the urban set. He did display some moderate contemporary poetry, but for the most part? The book was true to it's name... Urban Expressions I. Read the poetry, I think you will like it as much as I did."
1,Care: sound is awful,"I actually wonder if people praising this collection below did listen to it. I hope the new Platinum Collection that was remastered last year by Rhino (as for Ruth Brown) has a better sound. Both LaVern collections are the same 20 tracks. Here, and despite my love of this music, I consider that the sound of this CD (released in 1991) is a shame. So I thought I had to prevent people who want to discover LaVern Baker: don't buy this. Look for the best sounding collection in the first place (I don't know which one)."
5,a classic vocalist,i really enjoyed lavern Baker's range.i bought this disc last year and was very delighted with her singing style.tweedle dee was ahead of it's time.it had to help influence Rockin Robin?
3,"Good introduction to VHDL, but light on the details","This book is a fine introduction to VHDL, well written in the early chapters. Unlike most VHDL books it covers the language from a higher level, including fundamental concepts like test benches that seem to be buried or lost in other books on the subject. It could use a lot more detail, though, and the later chapters seem rushed, and also dated in some areas (VHDL 87 vs. 93 in particular). And as others have mentioned the examples seem inadequate. If you buy this book, you might also want to get something with more detailed examples to go with it."
2,not that helpful for a beginner,"I tend to agree with one of the reviewers that the some of the constructs are not explained at all. As a hobbyist my hope was to use this book as a guide reference and use VHDL using Altera's software but I wasn't able to do so. The examples are unfinished without much explanation.Good thing is that if you are a beginner you will learn something if not everything from this book. I gained a lot from chapter 2, first look at vhdl."
2,Poor Organization,This book has very poor organization. I would not recommend this book to a beginner.
1,Confusing text,"To learn VHDL you will need another book. This one is full of half done examples, none of them is completly finished. Explanations are confusing and partial. Do not buy."
5,Extremely Beautiful!(BY:Hannah/Chelsea&Yasmin),"Of all the new My Scene dolls being released, My Scene Fab Faces is the best! These dolls are already featured on myscene.com. Each doll has a beautiful dress, and an extra outfit that shows their style! Madison's hair is really pretty...just don't brush it. Madison comes with her dog, Bella. All the accessories are really glamorous! I recommend this collection! The prices and durability are really great!"
3,not the greatest.,"face vinyl discolors quickly and wont hold an ""expression"". buttons to change expressions impede outfit changes. cute clothes and accessories but kind of ho-ey for kids as all bratz or my scene barbie styles seem to be. not a great toy. was put aside soon after all the clothes were off. more of a gimick than a real loved toy."
4,madison,"now, don't get me wrong, i've always liked madison and all, i mean this doll is really cute with her dog bella and all, but there are 5 buttons sticking out of her back!WHAT I LIKE:1. she has a dog.2.she makes faces.3.her hair.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:.1.buttons in her back.2. the crown(I LIKE THE CROWN, BUT THERE COPYING BRATZ PRINCESS!).3.the mad face."
2,the Only One Club,The printed word is so small it is hard to read. There are two pages shown at a time and I had a hardtime reading it. I would have returned it if I could have.
5,Required Reading!!,"Differences in race, religion, politics, ideas and lifestyles have given birth to such an enormous amount of negative media these days. In the newspapers we read and the news programs we watch, we are suffocated by it all. What an absolute pleasure to read such a positive expression of being different. Jane Naliboff creates a beautiful story wonderfully written which should be required reading for all!"
5,everyone's special!,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends THE ONLY ONE CLUB about how a little Jewish girl, her teacher & a classroom of Christian children prepare for Christmas.Delightfully illustrated by Jeff Hopkins, THE ONLY ONE CLUB (for ages 4-8) is a thoughtful look at how alike we all really are, even when we are so different!"
5,This book will make every child feel like they are special,"In The Only One Club, Jennifer Jacobs feels left out and different from every other kid at school. She is Jewish and her class is making decorations for Christmas. But, since Jennifer doesn't celebrate Christmas, her teacher lets her make something for Hanukkah. When she goes home from school, she decides to form a club for herself because she is the 'only one'. Now the other kids feel left out too - until they all figure out what is unique and special about each one of them. What a wonderful way to show children how truly special and one of a kind they are! I plan to use this book with my elementary school students who need a boost with their self-esteem!"
4,Kindle version has small type,"Font size on Kindle Fire makes reading the story tedious. The story is very good and positive, both my three and five year old enjoyed it."
5,excelente,excelente libro. y el vendedor también es muy bueno llego en el tiempo esperado y sin ningun tipo de problemas
5,Uh-oh.,"This may be the best yet. I'll have to listen to it more, but no doubt a solid contender to overthrow Hebron Gate as the king. Groundation really steps up to the plate here and it shines through their horns and bass lines. The overall structure is so original and fluid it's almost shocking (for a band that still has such a distinguishable sound -- where running out of gas is almost expected by now). Funky, jazz-infested, original, roots reggae.Yes sir. Groundation."
3,Artistic writing?,"There are quite many memoirs written on WW 2 concentration camps. The writer is trying to present suffering from the childs point of view I guess. Didn't hit the mark I feel. Special writing, brief but didn't bring out what it should."
2,Short book Written for a child it seemed.,Not at all what I was expecting. Good for an introduction to this war for a 10-year old. .I wanted a novel and got a very short story.
3,One of the last eye witness's .,"We need all of these stories we can get, the sources are slowly slipping away, as the survivors pass away."
3,Yellow Star,This was definitely an easy read that would be beneficial for adolescents to learn about the Holocaust. I enjoyed the fact that it was written in the perspective of the child growing up during the holocaust. Quick read.
5,A good introduction to a difficult topic,"This isn't your typical book about the Holocaust, as it's appropriate for younger children. Written in verse through the perspective of a young girl, it's appropriate for readers of any age. Therefore, it's an excellent tool for introducing this subject to children. I think adult readers will find it poetic and thoughtful, as well.I highly recommend this book for book groups or for students. The Holocaust theme is painful for many people, but this book provides an opportunity to brooch the subject with poignancy and empathy rather than with fear."
4,Easy read,Easy to read. Written from a child' s point of view.Not very descriptive but you get the feel of the era.
4,Yellow Star,"This was a very moving account of life under Nazi rule from the viewpoint of a child, of miracles, and of prejudice. Easy to read and riveting. Recommended reading for all, especially young adults and teens who may have no understanding. Recommended for a history or Language Arts class. Also for Book clubs for sharing and discussion. Thank you for sharing your story, Sylvia. And thank you, Jennifer Roy, for hours of gathering the facts and presenting them in such a readable style. Hopefully you will inspire others to do the same, thus preserving those first hand accounts"
4,Excellent story,Telling this story in the person of a child is unique and a pleasure to read There is high drama in the sadness of Jewish persecution during the war and the beauty of a child's survival.
4,I recommend this book!,Page after page your heart goes out for this little girl. I cant help but wonder if the people of to day could be half as strong as the people in this book. Over all a very good book of a story that needed to be told.
3,Yellow Star by Jennifer Roy,"The book was well written but too depressing for me to really like it I,m speaking about the YelloI just finished the novel,Yellow Star by Jennifer Roy. The book was far too depressing to recommend it to other readers."
3,"Good, but not great","The story is inspirational, but the format will not appeal to all readers. If you (or your child) are expecting a traditional novel like I was, then ""Yellow Star"" may be disappointing.The book consists of a series of poems put together to tell a story. The book is written using very simple word choices and does not offer many descriptive details. I didn't care for this style and would have preferred a more traditional narrative or even a diary-style for the story."
4,Yellow Star,"Yellow Star by Jennifer Roy is about a young Jewish girl named Syvia Perimutter who is forced by the Nazis to live in a ghetto under impossible conditions during the Holocaust.In 1939 the Germans invaded Lodz, Poland and forced the Jewish population to live in a ghetto. 270,000 people where forced to live in these death threatening ways. At the end of the war, about 800 people survived, 12 being children. One of those 12 was Syvia. This story is about how Syvia Perimutter survived during WWII.Syvia's personality changes many times during the story. She is sad and lonely when she is told she can never leave the room. Syvia also goes from scared to hopeful and brave to happy as the story goes on.I like this book because it was exciting and helped me learn more about the conditions that people lived in during World War II."
4,A good read.,"This is a very moving story, one I found quite compelling. The plight of Jewish people in WWII has always touched me - this book reinforces many long-held beliefs and emotions of mine."
4,Good story of history,very good. Glad you wrote the story for her. Young adults and older should read so all can remember this period of history.
4,Yellow Star,This is a very good story by a young girl in the ghetto of Poland during WWII.I recommend it.
5,Heart wrenching story of survival,I would recommend this book to everyone. We should all know an never forget the horrors that the Jewish people endured. To forget is dangerous for us all.
3,Written for Whom?,"The title was too general. Unless one is into intelligent design, everyone on the planet is a Darwinian mutant. Who was this author trying to reach? Perhaps his old medical colleagues. At times it sounded like a textbook on genetics. But Peter should be given three stars for attempting to warn the world about tinkering with and modifying plant genes they don't really understand. However most readers can't digest the periodic table of elements to say nothing of the complexity of naked DNA vaccines, nucleotide sequences, genetic vectors, specie barriers, viruses, host cells and trans-gene expression.The book read more like a draft than a completed work. I'm sure a good screenwriter could present this book as a good flick on the big screen. The semi-happy ending, where only 400 died instead of 40,000, was definitely Hollywood."
4,page-turning suspense,"While I know little about the biology-side of existance, I felt that the Clement did an excellent job creating an air of realism and gave life to the possibilities he presented. All science fiction is about possibilities based on current science and technology.I could not put this book down and read the last 200 pages in one weekend. As a person concerned with my health and what I eat, this book made me wonder just what I'm buying in the grocery store.On top of that, Clement kept me guessing and changing my mind as to who the real mastermind behind the great conspiracy was. It was definitely worth my time and money."
3,expecting more,"ok, maybe im weird, but i wanted some ""mutant action""!! I'm almost finished and seems to be just the chase of the whistle blower....we know how all that works!! i want mutinish beings!!!!!"
2,Another fear-mongering slam against biotechnology.,"If you like having popular rhetoric slammed down your throat in the guise of a medical thriller, than this one should fit the bill. But if you have even a mild grip on the reality of the twenty first century, then this novel is more of an insult to the reader. I was quite surprised that a physician could write a novel filled with such unsubstantiated sensationalism--doing what one of his characters describes as ""shouting 'Fire' in a crowded movie theater.""I must admit that the 'suspense' and plot are better than average, but the unrelenting slams against genetic engineering and biotechnology get very tiring after the first 75 pages."
4,"Sheree's in it, nuff said!",Sheree North is my favorite. She's old now but notthen. She was hotter the Marilyn ever was. I wouldLOVE to have that seduction melting all over me!I'd give the movie five stars if she was in it longer
3,"OK, but that's all","The movie itself is better than the promotional materials suggest. ""The Outfit"" benefits from a really good cast, but lackluster direction and some unnecessary deviations from Richard Stark's book keep this from being a truly great film.Robert Duvall and Joe Don Baker are very good. Robert Ryan is excellent as a beleaguered crime boss, but Karen Black is rather so-so and a very young Joanna Cassidy (in her first credited film role) is rather wasted.It is clear this DVD was produced on the quick and cheap. Quality is just OK, and a lack of chapter stops or a 'scene selection' screen on the DVD is truly annoying. It's as if the folks who produced the DVD didn't even bother to actually watch the movie, just did a VHS - to - DVD transfer and slapped a label on it."
3,Several things in one book,"... Anyway, book is good, several methods are explained in one and the same book and strangely there are no too many such books to choose from. A bit pricey, when considering students. For students there are definitely much more price effective solutions to get information they need."
4,An interresting and easy-to-read introduction to an important subject,"This book is an accurate and interesting introduction to the subject of generational differences. It's divided into short chapters regarding different areas people from different generations view things differently, this makes the book valuable even if you haven't got time to read all of it (this, though, means that you'll have to read some explanations more than once if you read the entire book, it might feel a little bit repetitative).There are only two bad things about the book, in my opinion. The first is that it is a little too focused on work related subjects, at least for my purpose for reading it. The other thing is that the book is getting a bit old. I really hope that it's authors will make a new and updated edition soon..."
1,NO Detail Information,"Well I don't know what other people see in this book but it has NO detail information. An example of this is they tell you that you could create the template mailbox but it doesn't tell you how to exactly do this. That feature would be really helpfull if you had to add 1000 accounts. What this book is good for is to give you a good overview of exchange but for real life, I would go for something else. Anything else."
2,My guess would be: Bad.,"I found this book to be; Badly organized but not catastrophically, Total lack of in depth knowledge and know-how, almost totally worthless as a compendium, several hundred pages wasted on empty chatter and irrelevant fact on history and the world situation (some people might find these pages interesting, but I don't) and not at all measuring up to my hopes. Almost everything i know, i got from ""playing"" with Exchange in a sealed environment, and this book have been totally worthless to me."
5,WICKED GOOD READ!,"Forget any other Exchange book....this is the book...period! I didn't know a thing about Exchange...21 days later..I'm an Exchange guru...well not quite, but close."
1,Stay AWAY! Wish I had never bought it!,"I have had this thing for about 6 months and it has been in the shop 3 times already for bad hard drives. Yesterday the ""new"" hard drive put in under warranty AGAIN went bad. This thing has been in the shop more than it has been at my house. When it does work it is very slow, even setting the windows settings for high performance and no frills. I can't say one good thing about this laptop."
4,Good deal for the price,The laptop is feature wise quite nice though it lacks a few things- it has no internal microphone- keyboard is bit wierd- battery life is a bit short for a 6 cell battery.For the price-tag the laptop is a good buy.
1,Misleading,DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE. It does not run the new Aeors features despite having the required memory and Vista Premium O/S. It has the wrong graphic card. No where does Toshiba tell you this. Do not buy it.
3,Okay Laptop,"Was good for the price. crashed within 3 months so I re-installed the OS and partitioned the drive and it worked reasonably well for 3 years until the screen went bad and couldn't be replaced. Good, cheap laptop for school use."
1,Stay Away -- Hardrive problems -- Stay Away,"I have had this product for 2 years. I barely used it the first year b/c I was still using my old Dell (the laptop this Toshiba was supposed to replace), and I had to send the Toshiba to the shop for hardrive repair just before the warranty expired. After being in the shop of about 2 months, I got it back. Now it about 6 months later and the warranty has expired and I'm having the same problems. I've been researching the internet and this seems to be a common problem for these Toshiba's. I guess I'm back to my old Dell (which is still working)."
4,Good buy for web browsing an email only,OK for basic web browsing. Run MSConfig during set up to disable the Toshiba Start up add-ons. At best this is second PC only.Memory is below par for Vista Premium Home and the integrated video is minimalistic.Striped 75% of the Aero features and added another gig of ram to be able to run office 2007.
2,OK Laptop - Don't buy it to play games on,I bought this laptop thinking it had newer hardware and software Window Vista. Got it home. Everything started out fine. Tried to install two new games on it: NeverWinter Nights 2 & Oblivion. Forget about it. This laptop runs on a shared video card memory. All the newer games. Don't work with the Intel Graphic chips. They all want Nvidia or ATI dedicated cards with dedicated video memory. So now I'm stuck with an $800 dollar paper weight. As I wanted this laptop to do was some basic home office stuff and mainly games. So I do NOT recommend this system if you want to play an newer game available on the market.
1,THIS BOOK IS A PIECE OF TRASH,THIS is by far the worst book ever written on a person. If any of you are interested on the chapter on Rosie being gay don't buy the book Here are there reasons George says :Owns two motor cyclesOnly wears make-up onstageDoesn't shave her legs.Or chinDoesn't wear dresses or much jeweleryStill a self-confessed jockNot afraid of power tools.And lots more stupid reasons. I hated this book in fact don't buy it just look on the internet for all the information you need. Because acording to his bibliography that's where he got most of the information
2,Not the best book for a true Rosie fan,"This book is just a rumor filled book of junk. The chapter on her sexuality was distastefull as well as mean. We all love Rosie no matter what. She is an attractive women that diserves some respect. This was a poorly written book, with no taste. That only thing I enjoyed was the pics. There is no proof to any of the information, and I hope everyone realizes this."
4,Style and Comfort for a STEAL!!!,"I couldnt resist these shoes for the price...I've had good experience with Bandolino branded shoes. I have two other pairs that are stylish and very comfortable. Sure enough, this pair of boots are very comfortable too! The color is a great burnished bronze, that is a great neutral color to wear (plus metallics are in fashion again). The zip-up is easy, and the calf is roomy. I'm very happy with them, and would recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to spend 100's of dollars, but wants to get the look and comfort of expensive shoes!"
5,"Love, Love!",I love these leather boots and they are so sexy!nice heel and design back of boot is stunning.Ms. Row
5,This CD is the Must have for anyone who likes Patti,"I just picked up this CD and I enjoyed it so much. From the opening duet and all the way through the songs were just so good. I really enjoyed it. Listened to it 3 times in a row and was into it and singing along each time. Everyone in my office at work who likes Patti wants to get it now.If you have never heard On My Own, Stir It Up, New Attitude, When you Talk About Love, and Oh People (loved the video too) then you really must sit down, kick back and listen to a woman who can really sing (5 octaves).I have listened to the songs on the radio and TV a lot before and now I own some of the best singing ever. Love you Patti!"
3,the best of pattie labelle,I receieved my product in record time I was very pleased with that and the quality was well also.
5,Full Moon,This is definately on of Armand's greatest singles ever produced. It became an instant classic since it was first released. I think that every true fan of house music should have this track in their collection.
4,Good enough,"I got this for my moto e815. You need to hunt down all the drivers and software for it on your own if you want it to work well with the e815... The quality of the cable...well... it disconnects every couple minutes or so... but that was long enough for me to do a seem edit and so now I'll use bluetooth-obex to sync and transfer... which is all I needed it for. The charger also connected/disconnected constantly...making my phone beep every 10 seconds as it started to charge/not charge repeatedly. If you plan to use it for this purpose I recommend hunting down Moto phone tools 3.25b, e815 modded PST 7.11, SDmodified p2k seem, and the e815 usb drivers (usbmot2000.inf, and cdm1x.inf) Good luck"
3,"okay to use, but....",the software coming with the cable is very old and can not be used with MOTO E815. But the cable itself can be used to connect to the computer.
4,Great Toy,Bought this a couple of years ago for my for Christmas. He loved it at the time. Great for that 1-year to 18-month phase. But now we have it in the garage as an outside toy and all the neighbor kids love to play with it. It works with a lot of Hot Wheel cars too.
3,Inaccurate age range,"My son was 2.5 when he received this and played with it only a few times. I think it's a great, really cute toy, but once he saw the cars descend, he was done with it."
2,Not What it Appears to Be,"I purchased this item thinking the plastic was textured, but it was smooth with a peel off decal to stick to it to make it appear textured."
4,Sedated,"""Elevator music"" versions of Ramones songs? You Bet! In the tradition of101 Strings Play a Tribute to the BeatlesandThe Hollyridge Strings Play The Beach Boys Song Book, we now have ""The Nutley Brass Plays the Ramones Songbook"". In a way, this album is a parody of those old ""instrumental easy listening versions of rock songs"" albums. It has a few comical touches, like ""Chopsticks"" being banged out on piano in the middle of ""I Wanna Be Sedated"". But for the most part the songs are played relatively straight, with the humor coming from the idea of ""I can't believe somebody made elevator music versions of Ramones songs"". Thankfully, the arrangements here are much more imaginative than the ones on the old albums by the Hollyridge Strings and the like. I should mention that, in the retro spirit, this album is in mono. Recommended to Ramones fans that don't take things too seriously (and what Ramones fan does?). Oh, I should probably mention that this CD is only 23 and a half minutes long."
2,"Please, only for true Ramones fans...","I saw this as an okay album. Not a mistake, just a bit random. It's good to see how far The Ramones' influence has stretched, but this was not a good thing, and not a bad thing. The problem, mainly, is that the Nutley Brass didn't play as fast as they should and could have. I mean come on, they should have at least tried to match original album speed. I ain't asking for Live speed (God forbid they try). I'd say that if the back didn't have a Table of Contents on it, some of the songs would be hard to tell. Chinese Rocks was hard to tell, even with the name on the back.I do admit, I only got this to get another Ramones CD off my list. I plan on having all Ramones related albums one day, but I wouldn't have bought this otherwise. I suggest anmy non-Ramones fans to stay away.Thanks for reading and have a good day/night,Mikey."
5,The best!!!,"This is the best Stony Man book to come out since Dragonfire!! The sequel is good as well, but the first half rocks! There is plenty of plot to keep all of the characters busy without being thrown to the sidelines or shoved onto the back burner. The characterizations are spot on and the action just builds and builds. Also highly recommended is the Cutting Audio multicast version of the audiobooks--it will blow you away! (they have an online site where you can download the book)."
4,Spider Spud not a Dud,"Hasbro keeps up with the trends and what kids want. Mr. Potato Head Spider-Man was a great hit with my 4 1/4 year old great grandson who is a Spider-Man fan and a hit with me with the price. Mr. Potato Head's Spidy suit fits a little snug, perhaps from to many spuds (fries), but it is cute and I would recommend this toy."
4,Freaking awesome!,This begs to be hung from the ceiling upside down to recreate a certain scene from a certain movie.
5,my nephews buddy spider spud,my nephew loves his spider spud it is perfect it came in perfect condition he playes with it every chance he gets
5,Arcana Evolved. Evolution commencing,"Monte Cook's Arcana Evolved is an update to his excellent varient player's handbook Arcana Unearthed. Same world, same people, just an updated timeline. A new race, a new class, one huge change. Where AU is when the Giants are happily frolicing around the land, AE brings back the Dragons. Everything that is old again is new. If you enjoyed AU, get the book. It is filled with all the errata and clarifications. If you are new to the realm that Monte Cook has created, then buy this book. This book is a compilation of AU: a variant player's handbook, The Diamond Throne sourcebook and The DM screen w/ player's guide. A great value. Done in full color."
5,Hugely interesting and beautifully written,"Popular treatments of scientific and botanical subjects have been selling well over the past few years (Secret Life of Plants, Nathaniel's Nutmeg, Longitude, Fermat's Last Theorem, etc.), and this hugely interesting and beautifully written book goes some way to explaining why. Caffeine is the global drug, used in a multitude of forms by just about every society, but non-specialist consumers really know very little about the substance. The ""science and culture"" of caffeine - the story of how and why it achieved its prominence in our diet and its place in our lives - makes fascinating reading, and the illustrations are extremely well chosen. This will remain the standard work on the subject for very many years."
5,A few words about The World of Caffeine,"This book is a very interesting, well written and thoroughly researched work. It is extremely informative and reads in a style that is engaging while still maintaining a scholarly level.I would recommend the book to all who wish to learn nearly everything there is to know about caffeine.It is apparently the authors' debut work and, as such it is even more impressive. Bravo!"
3,Highly exhaustive and researched,"I first read about this book in a past issue of Wired and the author of the article included a few tidbits of information that would be found in the book. I, of course, must have missed it somewhere, but nontheless, this is a very well-researched, exhaustive book on the subject of caffeine. Being that it is very healthy in its information, it is very, very boring. This is not a book where I figure a person could actively sit in one place and read and read and read till they have finished with it. I must have had dropping eyelids more than 5 times. I am considering re-selling it, trying to earn back the $23 I wasted, but I might keep it on my bookshelf mostly for future research reasons."
3,Well-researched but somehow boring,"This book is really well-researched. All you ever wanted to know about caffeine is in this book. The problem is that the authors stuff the book with so many facts and quotes from other books/treatises that they make it unreadable. This is especially true for the historical part (first part of the book). If you want to know about the history of caffeine, I would not buy this book. The book also has a lot of very interesting statistics and facts, and just for that reason, I will keep it."
1,very weak and boring,A very weak and boring book. Don't be fooled: This book is NOT good. It's horrible. It's been packaged that way to make it sell.
1,Self hypnosis sleep CD,"This CD was totally useless for me. He has a pleasing voice, and the background music is fine, but the chatter is not helpful. Very little about relaxing, and a lot of New Age philosophy instead. I would send this back if it had cost more. This might be a personal preference, so maybe you will like it, can't say."
5,GREAT CD,"I got this CD because it has the song ""AT LAST"" on it.I'm getting it for Christmas so I haven't listened to the whole CD yet but I think I'm going to love it."
3,"Great For Starters, But Better Choices Are Out There","I've always looked at ""greatest hits"" albums as ""starter"" albums.A great way to sample the artists work, then decide whether you want to further explore (ie purchase)more from their body of work. This collection from Etta James serves the above premise to some degree. Although it is somewhat short in length (a trait common to all the 20th Century Masters releases) and doesn't contain some of her better ""blues"" work, it is decent way to sample Etta James's music; especially for someone on a budget. However, if you can afford a few extra bucks, I would highly recommend the ""Her Best : The Chess 50th Anniversary Collection"" ablum over this one. For a few extra bucks, you get 9 more tracks, better sound and better packaging. But for less than 5 bucks on zShops, this is not a bad purchase."
1,Look Elsewhere for the Blues,"The reviewers who pointed out that this disc is short on blues (mostly pop-influenced string arrangements)and short on music (less than 32 minutes playing time) wre absolutely right. If you want a single disc , go for ""Her Best"" (Chess, 1997), containing 20 of her best blues sides. The double disc ""The Essential Etta James"" (Chess, 1993) expands that to 44 cuts. Other excellent choices are ""Tell Mama: The Complete Muscle Shoals Sessions"" (MCA/Chess,2001) and her live masterpiece ""Etta James Rocks the House"" (MCA/Chess, 1964)."
2,Hardly her best,I was disappointed in this CD because it seems to be a compilation of her recordings that were clearly made for the pop market. It certainly isn't the blues that I associate with Etta James. My problem is with the title of the CD. A first-time buyer looking for a good cross-section of her music will be disappointed with this selection.
5,A Product of Its Time,"I read this series -- and especially this book -- when I was abuot ten. As an adult, I collected early editions.The series is politically incorrect and none of the issues would be relevant today.But there's a real fascination about reading these books as an adult. I like to imagine growing up in that era and the innocent fun they had. We can realize how limited their options were, but some of their core values (integrity, keeping a brave and optimistic outlook) hold today."
5,Long Legs Review,I've been wanting to read this book for quite a few years but could never find a decent copy to purchase. This book was in really good shape and was easy reading. It was interesting to read about some of the experiences of a flight attendant especially since I was married to one and a niece is currently a flight attendant.
5,Best FFL book ever,"As an American para of the same era as Simon Murray, and one who has had an interest in La Legion Etrangere since reading Beau Geste in the third grade, I found it absolutely unputdownable. It has also been published in French by Pygmalion Presse, Paris, and in that edition does double duty as an enjoyable read as well as an opportunity to improve one's French. If you have an interest in military history, politics of French Colonialism, or just want an evening's diversion reading an extraordinary journal of a middle class Englishman's survival and eventual success in a severe and foreign environment, you couldn't do better."
4,A challenging book for personal and group study,"Lots of excellent material in Bible study format. I did it with a group, and found that it worked well. But everyone needs to really dive in and do the reading!"
3,AWESOME HAIR!!!,"hey fellow fans,this is sicily again! I luv this dolls make-up and hair! She has that innocent, cute look because her make-up is really light and cute! Her hair has a great length and and she never loses her curly hair!!! My other madison, i decided to straighten it because it was really messy when i got her, but this madison is great! One thing, i think they need to change her hair sometimes, i mean, it always looks the same! Her hair's pretty, but it never changes! Anyway, that's what i think! I hope this review helps. But, she's really cool, her dress is sooo cute, her hair is fantastic, AND her make-up makes her look like an angel!Sicily #2 my scene fan"
5,Che Lives As They Never Wanted ....,"A must-have for any disciple of Che', an informative, inspiring and incredible documentary, culminating in heartbreaking footage of the ultimate sacrifice in Vallegrande."
4,"Good, but some weak points...",This DVD in my opinion was pretty good in the sense that it portrays Che Guevara as the man who he really was but I found that certain key acts of his life that were being explained in this DVD lacked the proper explenations and just leaves you wondering or wanting to further investigate the truth...Que Paso Aqui?
1,Is It A Travelogue or a Biography?,"If are interested in Che's journeys, then you'll appreciate this movie. But it's an insipid biography of his life.The problem is not merely that the film covers the most introductory aspects of Che's life. The principal problem is that the introduction offers no insight about Che that viewers cannot assume themselves without the film. Look at a pop poster of Che, make the usual cliché assumptions about a political radical and you'll have as much insight about Che as this film presents."
1,Che is nothing but a murderer,"I cannot believe people actually worship a cold blooded serial killer just like Stalin. He is not a hero or revolutionary icon, he is a murderer and it was about time that someone had caught this dimwit and executed him.He was also responsible for the torture of prisoners and anyone who had opposing views on the man was executed."
2,Not Worth It!,"If only I had been a movie star like Che. Kudos for great cinematography and excellant punch lines especially the ones about being the ""most idolized revolutionary of the 20th century"" and that ""capitalism exploits the poor"".While I may not have had movie star looks I was a far better actor that he was.For those in an a really revolutionary mood I suggest ""Reds"" and The Road to Serfdom both are more accurate portrails of the problems/failures of the communism/socialism systems."
2,Human hair dryer in box for pets,"This is nothing more than a hair dryer for humans in a box with a picture of a doggie on it. It is quieter than a regualr blow dryer - but dries with HEAT - which will dry out your dog's coat! Not good for dogs. I reutrned it, and gettign the metro forced air dryer instead."
3,Excellent Primer,"This was one of my first introductions to Modern Hebrew, and it is a powerful tool to improving communication. I thought the grammar section linked to a story and vocabulary list which was very helpful was a good way of introducing concepts to me. It covers the basic to intermediate level, and does a good job of enabling anyone the chance of being able to speak and understand reasonably well given that you practice with a native Hebrew speaker. I was overall happy with the purchase, it is however a pity that the answers to the exercises and a greater degree of English explanation that I felt was necessary is not present in this work."
1,Good Reading,"My husbands book, he has read it and loves the book. It is a well written , very interesting, easy reading"
3,good but not perfect,"This book is for the serious learner of Hebrew. Extensive verb drills, exercises, vocabulary.But with several serious flaws: no answer key, no accentuation of words which do not follow normal accent rules, vocabulary list in back of book is not really a bilingual vocabulary-but rather shows what chapter word first appears(not very useful!), exercises and readings are stilted and not practical for modern Hebrew(no idiomatic phrases nor everyday conversation expressions).If you can ignore the above short-comings, it is the best Modern Hebrew book out there today- (if only the Teach Yourself series would come out with their version of modern Hebrew..instead of Biblical!)"
5,Excellent Pace,"I chose this book as my textbook for my online Hebrew class at http://HebrewResources.com. The book is great, with one exception: there are few exercises. In other words it is not a workbook. Each chapter is 3 or 4 pages long, and there are 75 chapters. Each chapter introduces about 20 new vocabulary words. Several universities use this book as a textbook, and cover approximately 20 chapters for a first semester Hebrew courses. Thus, if you study one chapter per week, this book can carry you through 75 weeks of study, which is a great bargain!!! This book is modern Hebrew, not Biblicial (although there is a lot of overlap between the two). The book is not primarily a ""conversational Hebrew"" course. It does contain many elements of conversational as used in modern Hebrew; but it does NOT teach a lot of phrases like ""Hello, how are you"", ""Where is the bathroom"", and that kind of thing."
4,"Profiles, layouts, specs of 400+ sailboats. Great book!","Full of specs, profiles and layouts of hundreds of sailboats. A different boat model on each page. One of my ""most read"" books. I reference this book a couple of times each week. I never seem to tire of browsing this one. I also like the spiral binding."
1,molly,"i was under the impression this was an authentic burberry umbrella, when i received it it was a joke. don't be fooled, it reads burberrys on it. it was awful!!!"
1,I'm skeptical.,"I just returned from a Burberry store and shopped for umbrellas. I saw nothing without the metal handles and plaid loop emerging from that base handle. This looks like the many fakes I'm seeing on e-bay, etc. Too good to be true."
1,This is a counterfeit item. I have no idea why Amazon still has it.,"I do not understand why Amazon still has this item. I contacted customer support and told them that the umbrella is NOT a real Burberry and its not made in Italy. It has a tag ""Made in China"" and the quality is really poor, you can probably get a better fake in China town...This has been confirmed by several other customers who also recieved poorly made ""chinese version"". So the conclusion is ""STAY AWAY""!!! We probably need to report Amazon to Better Business Bureau for selling fake items."
3,Conga Player,"Great music, didn't care much for her singing. Excellent Conga player, I saw her playing with Jon Lucien, 4 or 5 great songs. This CD got a lot of air play here on a Jazz station, that's where I first heard a couple of the tunes from the CD, I had to go out and buy it. Looking forward to her next CD."
5,Hunting,"This book is a great hunting reference. It includes all upland game birds including all varieties of quail, pheasants, chukars, and doves. Charles Waterman shows how and where to hunt each of these species both with and without a dog. It's part of the Soeger Sportsman's Library."
3,"Good, but a bit bitter","Very healthy, but because of Omega oils probably, this is a bit bitter. Would be a big step to go from white pasta to this. Cooks well and gets nice and soft though. Would probably try Bionature first even though that does not get as soft as this, but does not have the bitter taste (although this has omega oils which is better for you)"
3,"Not a book, per se.....","but a collection of letters, notations, reports and the like from Civil War participants. As a chronicle, it is set up day by day, from 1861-1865, and offers one written piece per day from each side. No doubt it is in places very interesting, but it is not something I wanted to sit down and read through, nor is it something that would give the reader a cohesive sense of what was transpiring in the war on any given day. It is for me, rather, something to read when time is short."
5,Classic Unknown Blues CD,Stax didn't issue a whole lot of LP's in the sixties. This is a classic. Booker T and the MG's plus the Memphis Horns and Isaac Hayes are backing up Johhny on this fabulous debut. Every song is great.
1,Terrible book,"Not worth the paper it is printed onOne of the worst books I have ever read...and I read a lot. The author uses a well-worn plot: spies from Russia against the spies from US. Yet he cannot make any of it credible. Everything in this book conforms to your worst expectations. Shallow characters, stereotypical actions, simple plot.. The plot is easy to enough see from the beginning of the book...It has short sentences and a fluent writing style that make it an easy read...Still what a waste of time....I was interested in this book because of its context in late 50's space exploration....but I learned almost nothing on it from this book....If you want to read a good spy book, read John Carre. If you want to read a good book, read Hemingway or other equally great writers. Don't waste your time on this book."
3,"A decent, fun read. Forget the one stars","I've read Pillars of the Earth and found it fascinating. But to compare this book to that is unfair. Code to Zero was a fun read. Doesn't have the sophistication or depth of Pillars but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Was it a bit predictable? Yes but still, a worthwhile summer read on the beach"
4,"Gripping, Enjoyable read",An excellent gripping story about a man wakes up in a train station to find he has lost his memory. The journey as he pieces together his past is well written and an enjoyable easy read.
3,A Page Turner,"I don't agree with some of the negative reviews. I thought that this was a pretty good book. The suspense kept my interest. I enjoyed the story from the point of view of Lucas, the main character. I liked how the mystery was being unraveled as Lucas, who lost his memory, was discovering pieces of his identity. The plot had some fun twists and turns. The transitions between the past and present were smooth. Some of the characters could have been developed further. I had the feeling that the book may have been written in a hurry. And I was a little disappointed in the ending."
4,Cold War up close and personal,"This gripping thriller brings back the terrors of the Cold War as it follows four friends' lives after their Ivy-league college days. Follett curses his protagonist with amnesia, and follows his responses to this mysterious problem to reconstruct a saga of jealousy, betrayal, ideological commitment, and political ambition. He skillfully brings back the restrictions of social classs and behavioral codes of the times, nevertheless giving both the young men and young women action-filled parts to play. The novel effectively probes the issues of competing loyalties and loves, leaving it to the reader to identify with the best of these ambivalent heroes."
4,Dirty Work at Cape Canaveral,"It is 1958. A man awakens on the floor of the men's bathroom in Washington's Union Station and realizes that he has no memory. Is he the drunken bum that it appears, or is he someone else? As he works to restore his memory, he finds that he is scientist Claude Lucas, who holds a forgotten secret affecting America's future in space. It is hidden because someone deliberately erased his memory. But learning this brings peril. CIA agents pursue him, and they intend to kill him. While the countdown proceeds for America's desperate try for its first successful launch into space, Lucas uncovers the secret. Can he act in time to keep everything from blowing up? This story is not as powerful as Follett's recent Jackdaws, but it's a mighty fine thriller that will hold your attention. If you like spies and suspense, this is for you."
3,Predictably Follett,"Perhaps, his best work is Pillars of the Earth. It is unfair to compare this novel to that masterpiece. However, it would be nice if he returned to the level that he first accomplished in Eye of the Needle and Key to Rebecca.This has become what I expect from Follett - an interesting story lacking compelling characters that I could ever care about. This books follows the same unfulfilling road traveled by previous works such as the The Third Twin and the Hammer of Eden.The story centers around launch of Explorer I and the possibility of Soviet sabotage. I suppose I would have been more interested if Explorer were something more than an oversized weather baloon, but the Republic would have continued had the launch failed. The story moves along through subterfuge and deceit (some of it improbable).His novels have become predictable in terms of character and format and pace. If that's what you want this is a tolerable read."
2,Greatly disappointing,"Of course the protagonist lost not only his memory but had the misfortune to fall into an alternative universe where in 1958 there existed the concept of xeroxing documents along with Cadillac Eldorados and Ford Fiestas, which in our universe came along many years later. I too would have been as confused as our less-than-intrepid author, and I too would have lapsed into insipid dialog and unreal plot twists.Mr. Follett gives great credit at the end of the book to his researchers, etc., who helped him. Too bad none of them had the brains to do any research into contemporary history.For shame, Mr. Follett."
2,He's going to lose me if he keeps this up.,"The Third Twin was the beginning of Ken Follett's descent into mediocrity. The Hammer of Eden continued his decline. Code to Zero cemented it. It has trite diaglogue, is badly edited, lacks the detail of works like Eye of the Needle and The Key to Rebecca, and just plain stunk. The pages were double-spaced to make the book reach its required page length. One of the things I've most loved about his books was his ability to write vulnerable male characters and strong female characters. His characters were so thinly drawn as to be caricatures. Unless he goes back to being the writer he used to be, he's lost me. I doubt I will ever read him again."
1,"Mom, don't make me do it!","Amnesia is absolutely the most overused cliche in literature. I have never known anyone, who has ever known anyone, who has ever known anyone who has had amnesia. Ok - I know it exists, it is a medical fact. Still, this tool for creating a story is so tired, so pat, so ridiculous!! And how do the people in Luke's life react when they find out that he has amnesia? Is even a single one of them dubious, the least bit skeptical? No!! They don't question it for a second, but act like it happens everyday, and immediately begin launching into a description of what they know of Luke's background, as if they were giving a recipe for onion dip. I would not have read this book, knowing it was about amnesia, had not my mom given it to me for Christmas, knowing I like to read (used to like to read) Ken Follett books. No more, please!! Don't make me do it, Mom!!"
2,Flat and mediocre,"Ken Follett's name still sells books and that would be the only reason to consider this book. Peter's review below is dead-on - this is flat stuff - nothing like vintage Follett (Eye of the Needle, Key to Rebecca, Lie Down with Lions etc were very good).Either he has lost that touch or this is a rush job or ...The only reason to give it 2 stars is that it maintained the minimum interest necessary for me to complete it(not a very long book. A name other than Ken Follett and this would get a 1-star!Very very mediocre - character development is minimal as is the ""plot"" - if one can call it that. Do yourself a favor and give this one a wide berth."
2,Is Ken Follett ill?,"As a longtime fan of Ken Follett, I find his most recent work disturbingly lightweight. Specifically, is his interest in memory loss simply that of a professional writer, or is it a personal interest necessitated by his own loss of faculties? It is difficult to reconcile this effort with previous works, such as the splendid -- indeed, writing-textbook-quality -- ""The Man from St. Petersburg."" Or, ""Lie Down with Lions,"" or ""Pillars of the Earth."" Seriously, I had the feeling that it was written by ""a loved one,"" who tried his or her inept best to ghost in Follett's style, but fell dismally short of the mark. I was delighted as I began, disappointed as the book progressed, then angry, and finally appalled and fearful by book's-end. Ken Follett: If you're alive and well, please let your fans know. And if you're not alive and well, will the Inept Imposter please step forward to recieve the much-deserved lashes."
2,Good thing the night job is slow.,"Otherwise I wonder if I would have finished it. To be fair, if you had never read any of his really great works, it would probably be a good book. I, along with others, keep hoping for another 'Pillars of Fire.' This isn't it. I'm also becoming increasingly intolerant of factual errors. This is supposed to be the age of the internet after all and it doesn't take more than a few minutes to check some of these things. Don't the editors read this material before they publish it?"
2,Poor writing,"I have enjoyed many of Ken Follett's books. Sadly, I did not enjoy this one. It seemed as if it was written for a grade school student. To make matters worse, the characters did not react in realistic ways.All too often, the dialog goes something like this:Luke: ""Hi, are you my wife? I am glad to have found you. I have amnesia, and I can't remember anything. Sorry I have been gone for so long.""Wife: ""That's okay. I understand. What can I do for you?""While this may not be an exact quote, it is pretty close to what is in the book.Because of the ludicrous dialog, I just couldn't get into the book. The good thing is that it is a quick read."
3,Interesting Storyline But It Ain't Hitchcock,"It starts out like a Hitchcock film with a man waking up devoid of any memory or knowledge of his past or present and he has to piece his memory together while saving the space program in pretty short order. But I agree with previous reviewers in that Follett needed to spend a little more time on the previous life discovery process (maybe 200-300 pages more) because by rushing it he relied on too many coincidences and snap realizations.I will say that I did enjoy the read and it kept my interest because I wanted to see how it ended but he has done better. Check the book out from the library or borrow it from a friend, there are better books to purchase."
4,Not his best,"See storyline above.You can hardly go wrong by picking up a Follett book. He generally delivers top rated thrillers. I gave this book 4 stars because he's written a good story. The characters could have been established better, although with the flashbacks, you do get an idea of there personalities. This is definitely not his top of the line work, though it is better than most thriller writers. The author also does his research well. Throwing in tidbits about rocketry physics and mathematics, as well as the space program of 1958.An exciting story well worth the read, but not his best.Recommended."
1,Big Time Disappointment,"I don't know what happened to Ken Follett's writing but this book reads like it was written by a junior high school student. It's superficial, trite, and not worth the time. Having read some of Follett's previous books, such as Eye of the Needle and Pillars of the Earth, I had to wonder if this book was really written by him."
4,WOW,"I've read this book several times, and I always enjoy it. His ability to blend fact and fiction into a riviting plot keeps me coming back for more."
4,"Lots of action, and several appealing subplots, including romance.","Follett has a lot of gifts as an author. Rarely does his work hold together as a near masterpiece like his other book Pillars on the Earth. Code to Zero is great, and it is one of the better Follett books that I have read. The plotting is tight, and everything that happens moves us towards the ultimate goal of the rocket launch at Cape Canaveral. There are lots of action, and several appealing subplots, including romance. Yet I was upset in the end. What Collete's strength is, that he writes the characters with great depth and his books are easy to read and follow. If you're a Follett fan you'll have read this book anyway, if you're not, and you're a picky reader you won't like this."
2,ONE OF FOLLETT'S LESSER NOVELS,I'm a big fan of Follett's works so I was surprised that this turned out to be one of his lesser materials. The idea is interesting enough and the opening scene holds promise but I found it to be a lackluster presentation and after about 80 pages or so I gave up on the novel. It felt like a dumbed down novel in characters and plot demonstrations. Hard to go into more details without giving spoilers. If you want to see Follet at his height read PILLARS OF THE EARTH or THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE or THE KEY TO REBECCA. WHEN READ: November 2011; MY GRADE: C plus.
1,"Ken, wha' happen?","This is, frankly, a terrible book. It's made more so by the fact that Follett has written great books before (Pillars of the Earth, for instance)...so what the heck is he doing here? It is, at best, a first draft for any novelist. The plot: contrived. The characters: unbelievable. The writing: tepid, sophomoric. Whoever was editing this should be taken to task as well; there are obvious repetitions of the plot (like ""Pete's"" reasons for looking up to Anthony getting explained at least twice) that should have never made it to print.Ken, you're too good a writer to be churning out garbage like this. Take your time and give us something worthy of your talent and time."
3,Disappointed,"Very choppy with historical references to a point of being confusing (WWII, Space Race, Cold War scattered throughout). Character development very weak and outcome in many ways very predictable. Did like Billie!Felt like pieces of several other novels and movies somehow taped together. Found myself racing through the plot and simply disregarding the other fragments which had no added value. I know Follett is more capable then that.Take a walk on the beach, clean the slate and use the type of firepower you have.You got to be kidding me - swimming out to sea"
4,Fantastic Summer read,"I really don't understand all the negative reviews I've seen on this board. I read this book in 3 days (Very fast for me) because I simply could not put it down. The plot engages you from page 1, and twists and turns throughout the entire novel. I was riveted as I read Code to Zero!!This is a fantastic book to take along on vacation - it reads fast, and will definitely take your mind away from your day-to-day worries and hassles of work, etc. I loved the characters, the plot, and the theme, and will definitely go read some of Follett's earlier works.GREAT BOOK!!"
2,"Mildly entertaining, but that's all","I really enjoy Ken Follett's books and began this with enthusiasm. I settled quickly into the tempo of the book, but was thoroughly disappointed with the details which pad out the story - the environment, the history of the times, the fine details of the characters. This book is set in the scientific world of space exploration in the late 1950s, but it could be set anywhere, at any time. The only real references to the background subject matter are the headers in italics at the beginnings of the chapters - the book is remarkably light on research - so unlike his other great books.We follow the adventures of our hero who has lost his memory. Unfortunately, he finds this out and sorts out his life with remarkably little trauma and ease. He has a history of course, but even this colourful past is pat and unbelievable.This is quite a weak story that kept me entertained enough to finish the book, but no more. I was frankly disappointed."
2,"Flat characters, borrowed plot, awkward storytelling.","I really wanted to like this book - the premise of an amnesia victim struggling to find out who he is and what happened to him is, while not a new idea, a fun plot to read. But the flat characters never develop into people you can care about - and the flip-flopping of time lines to tell the story is awkward. The race for space with the Russians, amnesia, double agents, lost loves, cat and mouse games to stay alive - it's all here but it never comes together. Maybe Follett should have take a tip from Ludlum and gotten Gayle Lynds to co-write - perhaps then all the potential of this book would have come to fruition."
2,Please stop after the first 100 pages,"...and I wanted this to be good. I am fascinated by the idea of a man waking up and having no clue who or where he is. It started out great, but at some point turned into a series of car chases and simplistic dialogue. Hard to believe this is the same author who wrote Pillars of the Earth."
1,"Very disappointing, but becoming his standard","I am very disappointed that the Master who wrote Pillars of the Earth and Key to Rebecca should deliver such vapid drivel. This is Freshman Writing at its worst. After a series of exciting, well-researched and superbly written books, Mr. Follett has churned out Night Over Water and Code to Zero. He treats our nation's space secrets and an intense ...... relationship with the same surface brush, without depth and with infantile thought processes. I have now twice vowed not to buy any more of his books. I hope I keep my promise."
2,Not Follet's best work,"I've found Ken Follett's books to be ""hit or miss"", with this one in the ""miss"" category.This book comes across as more mass market trash than any of his other works, and his research was shoddy at best.The whole basis of the book was that the Russians were spying on the American Rocket program, which is a bit hard to fathom, as the Russians were far ahead of the Americans at that time. Korolyov and his team had developed the R5 and R7 by that time and didn't need Von Braun's help.His explanation of the Buzz Bomb is laughable.Overall, not one of his best. I suggest you try ""Lie down with Lions"" or perhaps ""The Pillars of the Earth""."
3,"A ""Made for TV"" novel...","""Eye of the Needle"" was one of my favorite spy novels, so I was excited when I received ""Code to Zero"" for Christmas. As others have said, it is an amazingly quick read and an interesting story, albeit remarkably similar to Ludlum's ""Bourne Identity.""The one thing that struck me throughout the book was that I felt like I was watching [reading] a made for TV movie. I suppose part of the reason could be the layout of the book - each chapter is one of three sub-stories, and you get a piece at a time. Since every third chapter (roughly) is a continuation of one sub-story, it's quite a page-turner. I think the other reason it felt like a ""Made for TV Movie"" is that the quality just wasn't there. ""Eye of the Needle"" was a much better book, and I would bet Follett spent twice as much time writing it.On an airplane? Need a ""quickie"" for a vacation? This is the book for you. A good story, a quick read, but not one you'll be thinking about after you put it back on your bookshelf."
4,"Fast, engrossing spy story","Ken Follet, in his usual style, tells a good, old-fashioned spy caper in ""Code to Zero"". Follett does not overload his stories with too many technical descriptions, nor does he insult the reader's intelligence; thereby creating a quick, entertaining read. Set during the time of the space race and Cold War of the 1950s, Follett dissects the loyalties among college friends who met and came of age at the dawn of World War II. Although predictable and littered with clichés, I still found it highly engrossing."
1,Terrible Disappointment,There is not anything anyone can say that would convince me that the author or this book is the same author of Key to Rebecca and Pillars of the Earth. This book was an insult at best - throughout the story the one thought that continually ran through my mind was 'Give me a break!'
5,Very Good,"This is definately a great suspense thriller written by a great writer. There can be no complaining about plot and character development, because both are handled very well by Mr. Follet in this one. From start to finish it delivers what it was written to deliver, suspense, action, and plenty of thrills."
1,Code To Zero Stars,"An amnesia victim, with no sense of his identity or personal history, goes to the library and, within an hour or two, determines that he is a rocket scientist. He pulls books from the shelves, determines that he understands many scientific principles, and out of all the known professions and occupations concludes that he is one of the world's top rocket scientists. C'mon !! This is ridiculous. Coincidence after coincidence makes this Follett spy-novel a concocted farce. This book does not come close to ""Eye of the Needle"" or ""Pillars of the Earth."""
3,"An engaging story, even if not his best","I found this account of space flight in the 1950's very entertaining. While the concept of wiping out someone's short term memory is hard to believe, I enjoyed the idea of trying to find out who you are by testing your knowledge and experiences. The hero, Luke, found out who he was too quickly, but the whole story has a quick and entertaining pace. Follett created an insight into the world of early space launches at Cape Kennedy and I enjoyed the action switching from D.C. to Alabama, to Florida. I bought this book for a long plane ride and was happily engaged for the trip. I echo the wishes of other reviewers that the characters should profit from more development, particularly Luke's wife. All in all, a worthwhile effort."
2,This one fell flat.,"""Code to Zero"" is set during the Cold War, and the US/Soviet space race in particular. It is the story of a group of friends at Harvard who become scientists and spies, spouses and friends. We begin with Luke, who wakes up in a men's room with no memory of who he is. Bit by bit, Luke figures things out and events come to a head at the launch of an American satellite.The story is by no means awful... but based on Follett's earlier, compelling, powerful storytelling, it is a disappointment. The characters are somewhat flat, the dialog is stilted, and the plot is simplistic.Follett certainly set himself a high bar with his earlier novels, which I do recommend highly. I was sorry that Code To Zero didn't meet that same standard. If this were my first Follett novel, I'd probably not pick up another... don't make that mistake, the others are very worthwhile!"
3,"Workmanlike, but far from Follett's best","This suspense novel, set in the late 1950's, is driven by a plan to sabotage the first American satellite launch. The principal characters have backgrounds in the OSS of World War Two. Beginning his story with a man suffering from amnesia, Follett works through the plot in a reliably workmanlike way, but without much flair. The purported consequences of a launch failure seem wildly exaggerated; failures were common in the early days of the space program, but did not cause the U.S. to give up on competing with the Soviet Union. Making the most heroic women members of minority groups while the villainess is from the white upper class smacks of modern day political correctness. Did American men of the 1950's really wear Chinos and say ""whatever?"""
3,pleasantly predictable,"Ken Follett does an excellent job at gaining the readers attention in the first couple of pages in ""Code to Zero"". Once you start it, you'll find it's a quick, easy read. Follett moves the story along at a nice pace. However, if you're in the market for something out of the ordinary, you won't find it here. Although one might argue that the characters are well developed, they are ho-hum individuals with little or no personality. I can't recall one good line from the entire book. Good news for those hunting for mindless entertainment, you've hit pay dirt!"
2,Disappointing,"This book disappointed the devout Follet fan in me. The book does have exciting moments, but its often very predictable, a trait definitely not desirable in any suspense books. The amnesia thing does seem interesting, but the author doesnt pull it off that well. I found Bourne Identity, (by Robert Ludlum) which has a similiar idea, immensely more exciting. I would recommend that to any avid reader of suspense. This book however is just okay."
3,I originally bought this book as a gift for someone else.,"The plot synopsis that I read interested me enough that I decided to read the book myself after the person I bought it for had finished the book. I'm not usually a spy/thriller fan, and have never before read any of Ken Follett's books - but I did enjoy this one. I found it entertaining, and was interested enough in the story and the characters to want to know what was going to happen next. I was particularly intrigued by the use of the U.S. space program as a major part of the story. I was too young to remember any of the major history that was a part of this story, but did follow the later NASA flights. And, I do very much remember the Apollo 11 flight."
1,No way!,"I have read all of Ken Follett's books and he is one of my favorite authors. NO WAY could the author who wrote ""Pillars of the Earth"" be the same author who wrote ""Code to Zero!"" So, I think it must be one of two possible explanations. 1) Ken Follett ran afoul of the CIA and suffered the same fate as ""Luke"".....he woke up one morning and couldn't remember anything, including how to write. Or 2) A high school student wrote the book and Ken signed his name. Considering the absurdity of the entire plot involving the memory loss, I would conclude the latter. Along with the inaccuracies, the characters and the plot are absurd and simplistic. A child could have predicted the outcome. Please, Mr. Follett, make your next book worthy of YOU!"
2,Nicely told but flawed premise and facts,"The spy story was told well and could have been a nice read if one could forget the absurd premise, overlook glaring historical inacuracies, and unbelievable happenstance.I guess, time to move on to another author. Too bad."
2,Disappointed with Follett,"I gave this 2 stars only because I expected more from Follett. The dialogue was sophomoric, the action was inconsistent (why would Anthony only erase Luke's memory instead of killing him as he did with other friends), and the development of characters was not up to Follett's usual fare. After reading ""The Pillars of the Earth"", which I thought was one of the better books I've read,this one was disappointing."
3,"Good story, not his best","I enjoyed this book. I read and own every one of Ken Follett's books. I especially liked the hero. I do question why two Harvard classmates of his would turn Soviet spy, however; more detail of how that occurred would have helped the credibility of this tale. And I also wonder whether the launch of the Explorer I--if it had failed--truly would have stymied the space program. I have a feeling we Americans would have tried again, without delay."
3,Attention to Detail?,"After all of the obvious research that the author did on rocket science, he blows it on American culture. Protagonist Luke wakes up in 1958 and steals a Ford Fiesta, a model not introduced in the United States until 1977. Neat trick, Luke. Maybe it was ""really"" a Ford Fairlane. Oh well, Shakespeare put chimneys in ancient Rome.As usual, Follet has crafted a pleasantly engaging read, but it does not hold a candle to Pillars of the Earth, Dangerous Fortune, et al."
2,ken who?,"if on the cover it is not shown 'ken follet' as author, how many copies this book will sell and how many review it will collect? luigi accomazzo italy"
3,"Not the best, not the worst","Although I read this book in two days and it really kept my interest, I was kind of disappointed. The character development was just not there in this book, and the main characters were always doing stupid things.Someone will have to explain to me why the main character would marry the woman he was not in love with after breaking up with the love of his life. Does anyone really do this? Things like that bothered me about this book.If you can get past that, you will enjoy this kind of mindless read.This is definetly not up to Ken Follett's usual standard, but then again neither was his last book. Hopefully he will pull out of this slump."
4,Follett does it again,I bought the book Saturday and a week later I had finished it. It leaves no room for putting it down and you're just turning one page after another to find out why this apparently nice main character Lucas has lost his memory. Follett has done his research about rockets very well and you feel you're right there following the breathtaking event of launching America's first rocket. Follett has a way of describing people and the settings in a very vivdly image and I didn't find it difficult to see the whole story running as a movie inside my head while I was reading. I gave it four stars though 'cause the ending is maybe a little too ordinary. But I can highly recommend Code to Zero
5,Follett at his near best.,"Well written. Easy read but very informative. Follett at his near best; he never fails to please, inform and engage the reader."
4,Fun Adventure,"I've read several novels by Ken Follett & have enjoyed them all. Code to zero is no exception. It starts off with Luke waking up on the floor in the mensroom ,dress as a bum & having no memory of who is & why he is there. It's a rollercoaster ride as you start to learn about Lukes past as he discovers links. It's a great book that keeps a fast pace & will keep you guessing well into the night. Pick up a copy of Code to zero & find out why Ken Follett is one of the best storytellers out there today."
2,"Ken Follett, please don't do this again!","This Follett is a mere shadow of his previous novels. I am a huge Ken Follett fan. I have read every one of his books and look forward to them. This book is written by a Ken Follett imposter! It is a huge disappointment with a ridiculous plot, featuring an incestuous bunch of people who are best buddies at Harvard and then segue into each other's lives forever after. They marry each other, they divorce each other, they plot and they plan. This book is very readable, a Follett trademark. But as the pages turn, I found myself getting angrier and angrier for being a sucker who bought this book in good faith and who was rewarded by junk. Such a poor effort that Follett, in the epilogue, mistates the moon walk as July 1968 and not the actual date of 1969."
3,"good idea, bad implementation","1 star for mr. follett and his creative juices coming up with the storyanother star for a fast paced novel that makes a good read on the planeand the last star for keeping me entertainedi withhold the last two stars: good but not great, and the other follet books are GREAT. also, i felt it was flat, i really like the idea of the story, but never felt it."
2,Little confusing,The whole book was totally different than what I am used to reading. It tended to jump around a bit to much and was semi-hard to follow at times. It needed to reenstated its points more often and not throw so much information at the reading in such a short period of time.
3,Good - but not Follett's Best,"I adore Ken Follett novels. I agree that he is the most romantic of all thriller writers. This one is well written, fluid, taut and touching at times. However, this does give the impression of having been written in a hurry. It is upto a standard - as most novels by the mature Ken Follett are - but falls short of doing adequate justice to the plot.I would give it around 3.5 stars."
4,Code To Zero Did Exactly What I Wanted It To Do,"I bought this book in an Airport when I was on a long lay-over. I read it in about 12 hours and it did exactly what I wanted it to do, it passed the time. Isn't that part of what all books are supposed to do? If the author keeps you entertained while you're reading the book, his/her job is done.The story line was very good, above-average in my opinion. I had never read Follete before as best-selling books aren't what I usually purchase.There were no slow moments in this book. I didn't analyze it for historical accuracy but taken purely as a work of fiction written for entertainment, it was very fulfilling.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something fun and exciting to read."
3,A Costly Conclusion.,"I gave CODE TO ZERO 3 stars, because it sucked me in. The plot starts out great. Guy loses his memory, and he must find out who he is. I found myself intrigued with what was actually happening in the story. But, a lousy and predictable ending cost FOLLETT two stars. Where's the drama? The Twist? Nothing! Straight as a board."
1,disappointed,"For the author of ""Pillars of the Earth"", ""On the wings of eagles"" this is a disappointig book. I bought it in the airport before a long intercontinental flight, thinking it would take me trough the flight. That was two weeks ago, I still didn't finish it. If you look for a cold war - time, spy novel, try something else. To bad for Follet."
3,Not as strong as it could be,"I agree with some of the others. This book is not one of Mr. Follet's strongest. The idea is a good one, and the retro aspect of the 40' and 50's could be a good one, but Mr. Follett does not take the time to explore it properly. The character development is a bit weak, and the plot is simplistic compared to earlier works by this author. It is entertaining though in it's own way, and it doesn't take very long to read it."
3,"Overdone amnesia but still a fun, fast-paced read","Code to Zero is an entertaining mystery-thriller that is relatively fast paced and keeps you guessing to a point. We first meet the protagonist waking from a sleep only to realize he suffers from amnesia. Slowly realizing his intelligence and his place in life, the reader follows him through Washington, DC to meet old friends from Harvard and a former love. Unbelievable, we follow him through interactions with the FBI/CIA and then to Nasa. We follow him from bum to ""potential suitor to save the country"". While the story gets rediculous, it is entertaining and fast paced, and fun to read."
2,"Nice, but not yet","I love most classical vocal music and sing in a choral group myself, so I was looking forward to hearing this ""child-wonder."" I have to say I was disappointed. She's still a child. One with a lovely voice that will hopefully be great one day. Let her grow up and develop her voice. Don't ruin her or her voice!"
4,It lived up to my expectations,"I don't care about her politics, but her voice is clear, hits the mark, and when she is given the right music, expressive (not always the case in a couple of later CDs and events.) This particular CD, however, has a lot of great choices for material; some arrangements could be better, true, but generally she delivers. Her voice is still young, reminiscent of a member of the Vienna Boys Choir. But if high, clear voices are part of the musical landscape you enjoy, you will get something memorable from this CD. I too hope she does not overdo it and damage her instrument..."
2,Okay but not my idea of the voice of an angel!,"Charlotte Church is okay and this CD is okay but when I hear her voice I don't think of an angel at all, now Sarah Brightman has a voice that makes me think of angels. Charlotte's not a bad singer and I think she has the potential to be a fantastic singer in a few years when she is older and her voice fully developed."
5,My favorite singer!,"Why those reviews commenting on her career and not the CD itself? Don't compare Charlotte with those grownup singers. She's better than all them to me because she sounds just like an angel. Charlotte's voice is more gentler and kinder. In Pie Jesu you feel loved by her voice, I cried through the whole tape and I don't cry for anything. My wife was surprised, she has never seen me express such emotions. Thanks Charlotte for bringing a little bit of heaven to me here on earth."
1,"""Voice of an Angel"" - So What?","I've been bought many classical recordings so that I didn't regret to buy. But this is the one that I regretted to buy it at the first time. She seems to set singing high notes above singing lyrics. Except for ""amazing grace,"" I hate this album.Don't buy it!"
5,My favorite singer!,"Why those reviews commenting on her career and not the CD itself? Don't compare C.C. with grownup singers. She's better than all them to me because she sounds more approachable. Polished opera divas sound very severe - like they're scolding you with their voice. C.C.'s voice is much kinder and gentler. In Pie Jesu you feel loved by her voice, not chastened. Opera buffs are used to that extreme sound but folks like me enjoy the sweetness of a C.C."
5,"a truly gifted child: ignore the naysayers, they're jealous","Charlotte Church has an beautiful voice. She sings like an angel. It is impossible to hear her music and not be moved by the overall feel of the thing. It's amazing the criticism posted here: it's all silly, and simply jealous. Of course Charlotte's technical skills will mature over the next twenty years: but really, if she's this terrific now, she's going to rank with the greatest ever then. Most people will enjoy this cd; it's a great mood enhancer. Charlott mmunicates a purity and innocence through the beauty of her voice; for this, thanks is extended. Good luck Charlotte, you have a tremendous careeer ahead of you."
1,no thanks,"not yet...why don't we wait a few years and see what she has left to give us. She's too young for such a big undertaking. It could seem like exploitation---but perhaps her destiny is to be a bright little shining star singing for all the dignitaries of the world, and making people very happy. She has the qualities that people love, she's young and she is a ""good little singer,"" but should not be putting such a strain on such a young voice. She may never have a career beyond these few ""wunderkind"" years, but no doubt she's made a lot of people very happy."
2,Sincere but thin,"Let Charlotte Church grow up please. Let's check again for her in about 10 yrs...doubtful that we will still be listening to her unless...she is allowed to mature, develop interpretive ability and have more heart than a boy-soprano. But then it could be that she joins the ranks of many, many good, professional singers who don't achieve the limelight.There is sincerity in her voice, she's cute... her voice crystal clear, but vapid and thin. It's good church music though and we applaud her love of music and singing."
1,"Unfortunate, More Predictable, Youthful Athleticism","Once again the music industries fascination with youthful athleticism has brought about another unfortunate record. It is time we got back to appreciating years of training, and living long enough to sing songs the way they were intended.I look forward to Charlotte Church's album after she has been further trained and gotten A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE.Overall the CD was, predictable and lacking any real human emotion. Much like an operatic Monster Truck pull."
1,a typical breathy mashed-pototoe sound loved by the British,"I wasn't the least impressed. As a professional singer ( have been for years, and having had a wonderful 6 octave range at seven years of age, and teachers wise enough to reign me in )and a teacher, I found raw ability, but not finesse. Too judgmental you say, well, it you are going to sell her like a ""professional"" she had better put out like one. Her diction is terrible, and quite frankly she sounded like a girl trying to sound like a boy soprano. She has lots of obvious flaws in her production -- a wobbling jaw when she sings loud notes, and a terrible habit of forcing and pulling the head back on the highest notes. Sadly, unless she gives up singing and starts to really train properly she will be only another drop in the pan. Interestingly, those who love her the most have no understanding of the music she sings. I hope that same mindset is not running her career."
1,A Mockery of the Art Form,"The girl may have some staying power, but the fact that singers such as Church and Bocelli have become a mainstay of opera lovers is a mockery of the art that I have grown to love. Church may have a cute voice, but she, like Bocelli, has no business calling herself an opera singer as she did at the Music awards. An opera singer is supposed to have great vibrato, virtuostic tone, and a true control of their voice. I feel a degree of monotone quality in Church's voice that leaves me bored and tired. This CD is a waste of time. Buy something by Cecilia Bartoli if you want some real singing."
3,"Beautiful voice, dull choice of songs","The fact that her voice is so beautiful compromises a lot for the choice of songs. Andrew Lloyd-Webber's Requiem Pie Jesu is beautiful but couldn't they find something more original, Ave Maria and songs like that are even worse. The welsh songs are a great choice. Altogether it is a album not to miss from a lady singer with a great future glancing ahead of her, but next time it might be better to chose some more original songs.Geert 't Jong, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"
2,Mystified by all the hoopla,"I read all the rave reviews, heard that the album was platinum, and thought I could not go wrong by buying this CD. Boy, was I wrong! Charlotte has a good voice but I don't like to spend my money on ""good for her age"" type music. She has trouble reaching and holding the highest notes in her range and just doesn't compete with major opera diva you might name."
2,a premature debut,"I don't think it's wise for Miss Church to receive so much hype at this moment. Although she has a pleasant appearance, there's nothing exceptional in her voice and singing. You may find many girls of her age who can actually sing better. It's better for to nurture her talents carefully rather than making such rash career decisions at such a tender age. Frankly, I'm bored by her singing after putting on the disc for a couple of times."
5,HEAVEN SENT!,"It is hard to express in words the depth of purity which transcends through Charlotte's voice. This CD will forever remain close to my heart. Heart! From heart to heart--that is the way a true artist should speak; Charlotte does. She's definitely a prodigy-very impressive.I love the way she sings in Latin yet inside the CD pamphlet it is translated in English for us to understand (not all the songs are in Latin, only about 1/3.) The first time I heard her was on television singing ""Pie Jesu."" I wasn't even watching; just doing chores in another room and I was drawn like a magnet into the room where the most beautiful voice I had ever heard was coming and sat down right in front of the television with my mouth dropped to the floor.I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages, but if you have an appreciation of classical music and/or opera this is not to be missed! Charlotte is like a breath of fresh ocean air to me. Allow her to transport you to your favorite place as well!"
4,Just Beautiful,7/28/99 Very engaging and beautiful. Her voice is still somewhat immature in some of the selections. I enjoyed listening to her on the PBS special recently and she has really grown into a fine performer.
3,Ms. Church needs more voice training and life experiences,"With the release of her PBS special, Ms. Church will soon become more popular, but this CD is uneven. While Ms. Church does well with high notes, she is less sure on the lower ones. In some cases, she sings the words without underlying emotion. Her reading of Danny Boy is an example. This song, involving an aging father saying goodbye to his son who is going off to war, is meant to be sung slowly, with emphasis on its melancholy lyrics. The arrangement is fast and the lyrics are sung routinely. I'm reminded of a line from Mr. Tanner, written and sung by Harry Chapin. The lyrics include the phrase: ""lacks the range of total color"" which seems to describe this CD. Ms. Church has been given the gift of a good voice which will benefit from further vocal training. As for showing that she understands the lyrics, this will come with time and more life experiences."
5,Truly the voice of an angel,"As a student of voice myself, I was surprised to hear the quality of charlotte's voice at such a young age. While there are imperfections in the quality of the recording itself, it's hard for me to turn down the recording based solely on that aspect. How seldom we hear from such a lovely young voice: Her tone quality is impecable. I thoughly enjoy this recording every time I listen to it, and I find myself with renewed zest for my own voice study. I can't wait for her to come out with a new record, I'll be first in ine to purchase it! She has an angelic voice, and I enjoy her truly inspirational choice of music liturature. Way to go, Charlotte!!!"
3,Amazing voice -- amazingly poor sound quality,"I read all the reviews before buying this CD, so I expected less than perfect sound quality, but I am surprised by how poor it actually is -- especially for a classical recording. Her voice is amazing, especially for someone so young, but the quality of the sound on the CD seriously detracts from the performance. It sounds fine in the car stereo, but a good home system will only bring out the imperfections. I hope her next CD is mastered better."
4,Beautiful Voice,"I really enjoyed the talented voice of Ms. Church on this CD. ""Pie Jesu"" is a soaringly beautiful, and emotional rendition of the song. The songs I really loved in addition to the previously mentioned are: ""Danny Boy"" ""I Vow to Thee, My Country"" and ""My Lagan Love"". The other songs weren't as impressive. They didn't really move me or stir me either musically or emotionally."
3,Another commentator,"Charlotte Church has a lovely voice, but I have to admit I was disappointed after all the rave reviews I had heard. She does not sing with the purity of the English choirboy tradition (though I'm sure she could if she dropped the vibratto) nor does she have the great voice of a diva (which would be inappropriate at her age anyway). Still, it seems Charlotte has opened the ears of many to choral music and traditional songs they would not otherwise have known or appreciated. I would not recommend this album to connoisseurs of either genre, but would gladly recommend it to anyone else."
5,crystal clear,"almost effortless. crystal clear voice. pure. I feel as if I were in heaven itself. For one so young to accomplish what charlotte has, is amazing. At such a young age. If a child will lead us then shouldn't a child have the voice of an angel?Pure talent!Beautiful voice, beautiful personality! Simply Amazing! I stand in awe!"
2,Has Potential-- I'll Wait and See,"""Voice of an Angel"" gives the listener a promise that one day Church will be a satisfying soprano. For now, however, her voice is slightly thin in the higher ranges and she lacks so much of the real emotion that makes the greatest sopranos so wonderful to hear. I believe that one day she will be among the best in the world. At present she is a very talented adolescent."
3,"Pleasant, but somewhat bland.","Aside from a few songs, they all sound pretty much alike. I won't likely buy another Charlotte Church cd anytime soon."
4,Quite Awsome,This album takes us places on earth we've never heard before. A voice that has come from another dimension. This and Angelic Piano are our favorite CD's.
1,"She's doing her best, I know, but..","Almost any professional singer I know could have made an identical record at the age of 12--but didn't, because it wrecks you to do so much singing so young. If you really want to hear classical singers, go to the opera, or buy an adult's records (I suggest Renee Fleming or Bryn Terfel). If you must hear a child, hear a boys' choir. Ms. Church's breathing, pitch, phrasing, artistry, etcetera will all get better eventually, I'm sure (if her voice isn't ruined in her formative years)."
