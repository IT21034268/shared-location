1,By-Pass,"My expectations for a better print than what I had in a collection were not met. In fact, it was a pretty washed out copy.The copy in the collection had some abrupt cuts that I thought the additional minutes in this version would correct. There were just more dialogue cards, not missing footage, to extend the time.Not an item I intend to keep."
5,A good introduction of the arts market,"Iain Robertson et al. is presenting this very sound introduction to the non-expert of the arts international market. It is a collection of articles from different authors; therefore expect a non-linear writing style, which is however easy to understand. It is written from the point of view of the curator, or of someone who stands outside the market as an observer. What one could find as missing, are other perspectives such as the artist themselves. Nevertheless, this book discusses a very wide range of the arts market and even includes chapters such as art crime. The reader can thus easily gain a very good (though theoretical) insight of how the arts market works and of who are the actors in the market.Five stars are awarded for this book, as I would recommend this book to all those who have an interest in learning how the arts market works and as this book delivers."
1,traitor,"Bob knovak knows who a traitor in the Bush Administration is. He gladly published the name of one of our own, his own, CIA operative for the sole purpose of partisanship. I don't mind partisan journalists, but as long as Knovak hides his secret, he is a traitor and I am ashamed to see he is still an active member of the American media."
3,Jason Miller all the way!!!,I must admit i bought this just because im a big Jason Miller fan and it's really hard to find his movies.I enjoyed it seeing him in action!
4,toy soldiers,this an ok film starring some well known faces in early roles and some you wont hear of again.A typical film of it's type but well worth a look.
4,Back to the Future rules,This animated movie helps to continue the saga of Back to the Future. Great video. You will enjoy it! Definatley a best buy for the true fan!
1,Not as good as expected,It worth as an overview of J2EE. But people who want to first step the product should try other stuff. The book is poor about examples and verbosy about business.
4,One of the good books with great examples,"This book covers a large number of j2ee apis in a coherent manner. It is a good reference book for every day use.Some parts of the book out dated with respected to technologies progress from it's publishing. The real life examples with oracle, weblogic, j2ee RI server is great help."
5,"Awesome- J2EE, CORBA, Web Services- it is all in here","The book is excellent for J2EE fundamentals and hands-on learning. It goes beyond just the basics and gives details about every thing you need to know about the J2EE specifications.--2011--Wow, it has been 4 years since I bought this book. Cannot say I have read it from cover to cover but I still go back to it to understand how J2EE works under the hood (almost).Excellent buy. Please read the web service security chapter thoroughly. JNDI is also discussed well here. Although it is time to learn Spring Framework now but never hurts to understand what it is based on. It is one of the few books that discussed both CORBA and RMI- fantastic really! The CD-ROM has additional content that is worth almost the same as the book.Good job Mr. Perrone and team."
2,Not for beginers!,"This book fails to actually teach anything. The author goes into long drawn out paragraphs and fails to say much. If you don't know J2EE, stay away from this book! If you are not great at J2EE and want to get better, don't buy this book! Only buy this if you want a refrence book, but it's not even good for that, IMO."
3,"Much too A/C, but what a great voice!","This album is produced to put Mitch Malloy into the Adult Contemporary format that was hot in the mid-1990's (think Martin Page). The production doesn't completely suit Malloy's style, which would ordinarily rock a little harder. That said, the guy can flat-out SING, so there are some beautiful tracks here. The first and last songs are particular stand-outs. This is well worth seeking out for melodic rock fans, but hard rockers might prefer either of Malloy's other two albums."
3,"Good for getting feel of the exam, not for solo study","This book is thick (over 1000 pages). It contains several practice exams for each subject exam. I am convinced that this book alone will not allow you to pass the exams, but should be used to point you in the right direction to seek more information. The preface recommends another REA book, the Clep General Examinations Review Book.I think the other reviewers oversold the book -- it only contains practice exams selected from a test population, with explainations for the answers. There is no guarantee that the questions in this book will be mirrored on the exam."
5,I love this one!,"I am not into the cowboy or bullriding thing, but I loved this movie. If you are a sports fanatic and still tender at heart, you will want to see this one. Luke Perry and Baldwin(I forget which it is)do a nice job. It is not the fastest moving movie, but in the end you will be shedding tears, and cheering at the same time."
5,8 Seconds - Love the movie.,This is an excellent movie for anyone who loves the Cowboy and bull riding life. This movie shows the reality of all of it and the movie is great.
5,A Precious Memory,"Lane gave his all and put his heart into bullriding, just as he put his heart into his family, his wife and above all God first. He had a dream and was able to see his dream and to live his dream, but our dream for him to go on was shortened. The movie ""8 Seconds"" made a dramatic impact on my life and I live life to the fullest and don't take time to enjoy the little things that mean the most. After watching the movie, doing research, and spending time going back into my teenage scrapbooks, I learned that I had liked him back when he first started riding, (even though I am older than him slightly).His family, his wife, his friends meant the world to him. I wish all them the best and I will do whatever it takes to keep his dream alive. Thank you."
5,The coolest guy in the world had to die.,Lane Frost was the best bull rider that I have ever seen. I was 2 years old when he was killed. Lane rode the best and tryed to do his best. He didn't need to prove to any one that he was the best because we could tell by his bull riding. This movie is such a tear jearker. I loved this movie.
5,Great movie,wit with very good bull riding scenes. Made me want to try to ride a bull but then i thought better about it.
5,Amazing!,"I recently watched ""8 Seconds"" for the first time without any real expectations. I like rodeos, but I wasn't sure how well they'd portray it in the movies. But instead I laughed, cryed, and loved every second of the movie. Lane Frost was an exceptional human and I think it is only fitting that he should be remembered by a video. I think he would have liked this tribute, I know I did."
5,That's why we call them heroes!,"8 Seconds may not have been the best among critics, but it has won a place in my heart forever. As Lane struggled with being ""a cowboy and a nice guy"" he showed us all the true happiness that comes with living your dream. That's what the movie is all about and the actors and actresses did an outstanding job. I laugh and cry (no, SOB) EVERY time I see this movie and I recommend it to anyone who still believes in heroes. Cowboy UP!"
5,a heart touching movie about a true hero,"this movie was a great movie and a real tear jerker. it doesn't matter how many times you watch it, you will cry everytime. the soundtrack on this movie is excellent, too, i listen to it all of the time. this movie makes everyone realize how hard it can be to be a bull rider sometimes."
5,The most touching movie ever about a legendary cowboy,"This movie really touched my heart. Lane Frost was the best bull rider in the world. This movie really gives you a feel for what life was like for Lane and also for a cowboy. I feel that the makers of the movie did a great job in making sure that the facts that they had were acurrate. It's a great movie and I think that everyone should see it because if you didn't know Lane Frost, then you are missing out. Everyone should see what a great cowboy and gentleman Lane is and I think that this movie has it all."
2,A B movie but not by design?,"Hey, the stunts are very well done, but nobody is going to believe Luke Perry is a bull-rider as he is just too weak and puny?The two main actors are just very bad and unbelievable as is the script in a lot of places. Cynthia Geary doesn't look like she could ride a golf cart without falling off,m let alone a quarter horse?The actual best actor in this movie is Steven Baldwin, the character actor,best friend of Lane Frost. The director should have ""Cowboy-ed up"".At least we see that Lane Frost died doing what he loved.I've lived in a Rodeo town most of my life:the real cowboys are both tough and strong."
1,Defective Item,"Although I am satisfied that the item did come in on time, I am disappointed that it is defective. I tried playing the disc on two different dvd players, and I also tried cleaning it, and still nothing would happen. This is one of my favorite country movies, and I was looking forward to seeing it."
1,swindled,"I gave it 1 star because it wouldn't let me give it 0 stars. This product is worthless to me since it won't even play in any DVD system I have. The disk won't even be recognized.... turns out I was sent a DVD with a different ""region code"" (like for Europe or some other place that isn't America) so no American systems are capable of playing it back.... what a waste of money"
5,Greatest true story of all time!,All I have to say about this movie is that it is outstanding. Really hits home and the heart. True story of a man with a dream to become world champion bull rider and live a new life.
5,"Excellent, knowledgeable perspective on a complex issue","This book is very readable and to the point. It provides a good introduction to the uninformed and causes those that think they understand it to reevaluate. He exposes the financial/political motives underlying much of the Y2K hype. Those that know the real severity of the problem are also those that benefit financially by it's being perceived as a BIG problem. I wish this book had been written 2 years ago, before so many were scared by the extremist books."
5,Fantastic,"Great album. Better than George jones. 50,000 names and cold hard truth make this album worth it. The other songs are good too"
2,"If you are looking for Carrie singing, don't buy this....",This is a beautiful CD but it is NOT Carrie Underwood singing. Country Piano Tribute is just that - piano music. I guess I had thought it would be Carrie singing with only piano accompanying her.
3,Better for the professional,"This is a really good book; however, it is written on a more professional level like another person said. If you are educated in college you can probably read and understand. If not, pass on it."
2,pirated DVD,Dont ever buy this DVD . It is absouletly not orginal one and no clarity of even vcd video even.!!!Terrible experiece first time from Amzaon!!!!
4,"Slow to get started, but good stuff","I think this book was originally published as separate volumes under different names, now brought together under a single heading. There is a slow build up to the good stuff, but it makes some very good points. The rating is only four because I think there are better alternatives out there, including Evangelism for Normal People. With that said, I thought this book valuable enough to re-purchase it (I loaned it out a few years ago and never got it back, so I bought it off Amazon, hence this review)."
4,Bigger than the picture,"Purchase this after looking for a gas container that will last; believe me it will last. The only remorse i have is that it is far bigger than the picture on amazon, bigger is fine if you will be using 5+ gallon per week, but it is heavy.... One other note... the safty feature that the ""goverment"" mandated tank sucks!!... this unit is not for use by my wife.... safty at your own expense i suppose...."
3,Runs small,"It is shorter on me than in the picture (I'm 5'9"")and I had to take out the side seams to make more room for my hips. The material is a nice quality and heavy enough to wear without a slip. I put a turtle neck sweater under it for winter and wore it with tights and boots. That made it an all-year-round look. I won't buy another one and only recommend this if you are petite."
2,Didn't like it then.......,"and I don't like it now. It is painful for me to say this because I am a huge EPMD fan but this album is horrible. This came out in 94'?!?!?!?! Look at the other albums that came out that year. Nas' Illmatic, Snoop's first joint, Outkast's first joint, etc. The point is some hot albums came out this year and PMD coming from his background should have fallen right in line with the hotness of that year. The lyrics are weak along with the beats. I thought maybe it was my mental state back then on why I didn't like this release. But I got the same feeling when I listened to it today. This album has no replay value what so ever. Amazingly, the second solo release from PMD is DOPE!!!!!"
5,This is an abstract sound!,"I would not listen to the negative vibes. Those, who can not rap, have to make irratic comments. I like this album because it is a different sound than most albums on the market. It tells people that you are not going to flow with their grooves but you own."
2,Too Little Too Smelly and Too Hard to Carry,I didn't care for these bags. The bags themselves are small. I have medium sized dogs. If you have a big dog with a lot to give: good luck. The bags also have an aweful perfume aroma that only adds to the effect of what your dog has already done for you. The Cylinder type dispenser is clunky and nearly useless.
5,A Must Have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This product is amazing, you will wonder how you ever lived without it. It is easy to use. We just use heaving whipping cream (no suger, nothing else) and it is wonderful! I use it in my coffee every morning!!!"
2,Handicapping Paradise,"I ordered this book with the hopes it would give me extensive details about accomodations, restaurants and attractions. The book delved somewhat into that area but still left me with a lot of questions as I ponder my upcoming trip to Hawaii. More ""meat"" is needed in this book.I have found more information on the internet regarding handicapped access in Hawaii than I found in this book."
4,"exelent content, too short","This book has a few great recipies that are easy to follow, and very TASTY! The cannabutter recipie is exelent, but personaly, I find that instead of two ounces of leaf, one ounce of flower tops and half the amount of butter they suggest, makes POTENT, POTENT butter, wich you can simply add to any pre-made brownie mix for exelent results. The only thing I found dissapointing was the length of the book, and the amount of recipies held there-in. It's main saving grace bieng the cannabutter recipie, wich can be used in any recipie that requires butter. All in all I'd say that this is a great book for those without a lot of experience in cannabis cookery, or for those who need a little refresher in the finer points of cooking this sacred herb."
2,"Looks good, but not much fun...","At first, I got excited that it doesn't require any batteries, as we use a lot of them in our house. But after we got the gun and tried it out, we quickly became disappointed with it. It is very VERY hard to blow bubbles out of it. You have to pull on that trigger for a long time until ANYTHING comes out. And most of the time it's the solution, not bubbles, the solution just runs out of the barrel. VERY hard to form bubbles with this gun for an adult, not to mention a 3,5-year-old kid. And keep in mind, it's 1 bubble at a time! You spend a minute working the trigger and then, if you're lucky, you'll get ONE bubble. So, it's a disappointment. I would recommend to invest in a battery-operated automatic bubble blower, that blows a lot of bubbles at once."
1,my 3 year old cant make bubbles,I have to agree with the other reviews . i to had a problem with the trigger also. i thought this would be a great toy. the no spill holster seems to work great.and the gun only shoots out 1 or 2 bubbles at a time. so my toddler and my dog got board
1,"Good Idea, Poor Toy","I loved the idea of this toy. However, it does not function. You have to pull the trigger quickly and the younger kids aren't coordinated enough to do this. When you do pull it quickly, there are maybe two or three bubbles blown. However, that is about 1 out of every 6 tries. I would not recommend."
2,"Great music, poor video","I have been to many Latin Jazz concerts, and some of the most beautiful things to see during a performance are how each musician plays and the dynamics of the group (ie. trumpet and conga solos). This video totally lacks these effects. Master congero Giovanni Hidalgo has some beautiful solos but are not shown during the video. The producers were too busy putting special effects and people dancing that block the performer. If you are looking to see performers play Latin Jazz or Latin Music in general, you might be better off watching Buena Vista Social Club or Calle 54 (Excellent choice. Producers should have learned from this video)."
5,Good product,Good product at a good price. Product is exactly as described. I will be purchasing additional cleaning patches soon and will purchase this product again.
2,Not as good as I hoped,"These are about 1/2 the price as the ones in my local outdoor store. They are also about 1/2 the quality, I end up using 2 times the amount if not more when cleaning. They are very thin and the threads come out easily. If your looking for cheap, look no further. You get what you pay for with these."
5,Only patches I will buy!,"Not too much to say these things are great! They soak up so much stuff I could not be happier. I have no issues with fibers being left behind. I just pull on all the edges and give a little shake to get any loose ends off, and nothing is left behind on my 1911. I will buy these again when my supply starts to run low."
4,really hold together,It seems that I'm always cleaning one gun or another. These patches really hold the dirt and you can use them to keep scrubbing and scrubbing. Best patches I have used so far
4,"RF connection doesn't work, bad technical support","This VCR have great feature for the price. It works enough well. It has to be used with RCA connection. RF connectors( in and out) are present. But output doesn't work and technical support of Samsung and repair centers are unable to get it work. Meaning you don't have a signal on the RF connector when you are playing a tape or selecting a specific channel.I should mention also Samsung technical support is very bad, they have big problem to understand this worldwide VCR. One technician even hang-up on me because it was close to the end of working day and didn't want to handle cases on this VCR..."
4,Excellent VCR while it lasts.....,"Even for the price, this is a brilliant VCR for use of all regions of video tapes. After a few years, the video heads WILL deteriorate to the point where you will constantly see small white lines on your TV screen which ruins the viewing pleasure."
2,Bad out of box experience,"Unfortunately the unit was defective right out of the box. When switched on, the motor made a loud noise, like it was racing.Samsung's customer support was difficult to contact, and did not get back to me prior to several follow-up calls.Furthermore, Samsung's website is arranged so that the nearest authorized service center appeared to be in suburban Baltimore - not very useful if one lives downtown in Washington, DC, and does not have a car. Further investigation showed that there are actually two repair sites in Washington, one in NE and the other in a Virginia suburb.Samsung clearly has quality and customer service problems that will prevent it from overtaking its Japanese rivals in the near future."
2,Keeps your room warm,"I have had the same snow problem as others describe in the reviews. I cleaned the heads -tried everything. One thing the unit does well is heat the room. Samsung produced a portable worldwide heater, capable of warming a small sized bedroom in just under an hour. If the VCR portion doesn't work for you, I recommend using it as a heater. Very satisfied with my heater purchase."
2,This deck ceased to work within 2 years.,"I read this review on the internet. Mine did the same thing.""This basically gives good video and conversion quality (I used to play PAL tapes on a NTSC system), but the problem is its poor durability. This deck ceased to work within 2 years, the LED of the ON switch being the only part still working. Opening the deck up revealed a darkened area on the board around a few components, which were apparently heated up so much during normal operation that they burned down. I have concluded that this is a design mistake. It seems Samsung did not get their basic circuitry right. If you buy this VCR, you had better have some repair experience and get your hands on a service manual."""
1,Worst VCR I ever owned,"The first impression was great. It played all of my PAL VHS tapes, and converted them with reasonable (not great, but I didn't expect it to be great) quality. Then, after about 6 months it started ""snowing"" and then the whole screen become filled with snow that it basically impossible to see anything on it now. I've also tried to use it to watch my PAL DVDs on NTSC TV, and noticed strange sound drops. Sometimes, for no reason, it would only show video and audio would be completely mute. I've had nothing but problems with it. Samsung *really* should've recalled this model. I would like file a lawsuit on behalf of all people who got fooled the same way as me with this VCR against Samsung. A friend of mine owned the same VCR and his died in less than a year. So you spend $300 on something that you hope would last for a long time and you get *this* instead?"
5,After all these years,"This VCR is simple to use and robust. The conversion quality is ok, probably better than with most other multi-standard in this price range and definitely better than my region-free DVD player, which produces pauses that are noticeable during fast movements.I have owned this VCR for 5 years now. I returned the first one under warranty for what I thought was a defect, but I now know was the Macrovision protection of my Sony VCR - I looped the signal through the other VCR before it reached the TV. The replacement has served us well for a long time - until my 2 year-old daughter force-fed it a Finding Nemo DVD. The DVD survived, the VCR did not. It does not load/unload cassettes properly anymore. I have been trying to figure out what the problem is, but the mechanics is complicated and fragile. I gave up and I am trying to replace it, only to find out that the sV-5000 is still the best choice out there. I will buy another one."
1,Broke after two weeks,"A complete piece of crap! Stopped working after two weeks, wouldn't eject tapes and destroyed one of my cassettes. Do not consider purchasing! I thought I was safe since it was a pretty expensive player."
2,it does not work for SECAM tapes...,"This VCR plays PAL tapes fine. I got tapes from England and Australia and they play fine with this VCR. However, it cannot play my SECAM tapes in color. All my french movies are played in black and white, and I am very disappointed. Can someone explain to me why this VCR does not work for SECAM tapes?"
1,Complete and utter garbage,"I used this VCR for about a year before it developed the ""snow"" problem mentioned by so many other reviewers. None of the suggested fixes worked at all. I'm stuck with a very expensive doorstop.Given the number of people who have reported this identical problem, I can only conclude that the SV-5000W is poorly engineered trash. I won't be buying any Samsung products in the future."
2,Poor playback quality,"The system is great for PAL tapes as we have tapes from Argentina and Australia - no problems to view them on an NTSC TV.However, on some NTSC tapes I found the playback quality bad, specifically the image jitters like it is missing frames. Especially bad seem to be tapes from Disney, Barbie as Rapunzel, The Beauty and the Beast, etc so I thought it may be a macrovision problem but I found out that Beauty and the Beast does not have macrovision protection. Cartoons such as Pokemon 3 were also bad. The tapes we were using were original tapes and when we play them on our other Sony video or Zenith video we have no problems so the problem is in the Samsung machine not the tapes. Disappointing for an ... video."
1,Score based on Quality and customer support experience,I got this device to view European PAL tapes on a NTSC TV set. With the price about 5 times of standard VCR it's obvious that one does not buy it to view NTSC tapes on a NTSC TV set.The quality of the conversation is low and does not satisfy the high price of the device (the image is flickering and areas of same color seem to be pulsating).Samsung customer support refered me to a repair location. I turned the device to the shop they recommended (back in July 2001) and I'm still waiting for a resolution (it's now mid Sept. 2001). Even though I contact Samsung customer support almost daily they do not offer a resolution or at least answers to my questions.
3,Why it doesn't work on SECAM - L (FRANCE),"To the folks who have had trouble using this unit for recording(or viewing) SECAM - L tapes, THIS UNIT WON'T DO IT - PER SAMSUNG. Buried on page 18 of the Owners Manual it clearly states ""*SECAM L (FRANCE) is not available on this VCR.I called Samsung and the confirmed. If you want to do SECAM L (France) you need to step up to the SV7000-W VCR. Supposedly it's about the same price according to Samsung Cus.Svc. but so far the only price I got was $190 higher !!! I'm still looking.The vendor I'm delaing with Elite Video recommended the EmersonEWW7070 (which amazon offers too) but I don't think the specs are the same. I don't think much of Emerson VCRs either (had 2other regular Emerson VCRs crap out) Hope this helps some of you."
2,"Great, but short-lived","A friend of mine and I were both impressed with the features of this system and each purchased one. We used it for NTSC as well as PAL videos, hooked up to a US TV. It was very flexible and offered a great set of features for the price. The high speed rewinding was also a bonus I appreciated. Each of our VCRs broke within 2 years of purchase. It's never a good time for your VCR to stop working, but additionally, repairing the device would have been more expensive than purchasing a new one. I will not purchase this item again and really hope that these features will be available in a reliable VCR in the future. I'm still frustrated and VCR-less (basically we just play our DVDs now). My friend purchased a multi-system TV and cheaper multi-VCR. This item is NOT reliable. I strongly suggest that you not purchase this VCR, unless you are willing to view it as disposable."
1,bad conversion quality--not worth the price!,"I have been very disappointed in this product. I bought it to make VHS copies of videos that I have made with my digital video camera and edited. Converting from NTSC gives a low quality product in general. There is a vibration or pulsation in all white or light colored areas which is VERY distracting. But worse than this, when I input from the NTSC video camera and make a copy on VHS (whether converting or not), there is a real problem with the audio. A buzz that intermittantly accompanies the sound--and it was this way straight out of the box. It makes for a very poor quality video and I paid over $500 for it 3 years ago. Unfortunately, I did nothing about it until after the warranty had expired. So I took it to a Samsung repair shop in Rome expecting to pay for the repairs myself. Unfortunately, that wasn't even an option. They told me that it was badly made from the start and there was nothing to be done about it. I feel burned!"
1,Very poor vcr,"Samsung just doesn't make a very good vcr. It has automatic tracking that just doesn't work, it goes in and out throughout play and on pre-recorded material. If your trying to find a spot your looking for this is not your vcr, you can't view the tape in fast forward or rewind, this unit cost $ 400 and my $ 60 dollar american made unit beats this one hands down."
2,Taped 60 tapes and then a $135 repair job...,"I bought this to help convert 250+ PAL VHS tapes to DVD. It was a bear to figure out how to set up - I am somewhere in the middle when it comes to technical know-how but this one was beyond me.I gave up and let it sit for a year and a half - a very expensive paperweight. Finally got it working, and 60 tapes in it turned to nothing but snow.Needless to say for the $300 price, I was NOT happy. 3 days and a $135 repair job later, I'm back in action. I have 150 tapes to go, and I am hoping and praying this thing lasts on me. I honestly don't expect it to...I am definetly dissapointed in this one. Seems like it needs a lot of massaging to get it to work right, and when it does work, it doesn't last. Unit runs hot - very hot. I leave it right by the A/C to help keep it cool. Blocking it with anything will most likely result in a very crispy unit!"
3,CD Slots,"Product appears to be good quality and looks great, but the slots for the CDs are different widths so the cd's rest at different angles. Uniform slot width would have been preferable."
5,A piece of art,"This Dvd is the best out of all of them, it comes with everything you need, and it never breaks. So buy this Dvd player and you get your money's worth."
3,HELP!,"Does anyone know the name of the song playing at Jake's after everyone left and it was just Patrick and Robin? Show date was 5/4/06. The only lyrics I could make out were ""We can live, we can love, and fly away"""
4,Help Needed,This CD is great but I wanted to find out if anyone new the name to a song that was played on General Hospital just last week. It was a song they played When Elizabeth & Ric decided to get married. If anyone knows the name or the artist that would be great.
3,Crazy Love,This is a great cd. But does anyone know who sang the song Crazy Love that played on the next day's episode after Sonny left Brenda at the altar. She was in the honeymoon suite thinking about Sonny and the crazy love song played. I know it was originally sung by Van Morrison but its not his version that plays. Pleas help me my email is cunei@hotmail.com
2,Dissappointing,"I am a huge GH fan, but this was a huge dissappointment!!! Don't waste your time or money ordering this one, skip it!!"
2,Looking for the song played at Luke & Laura's wedding,"Does anyone remember the song played at Luke & Laura's wedding, thought it might have been a Kenny G song, but I just cannot seem to locate it."
2,are you kidding ?,"it sucks ! the only good songs are the dave koz compositions ,whatever happened to the songs from the 80's the golden years of this soap ?"
2,Never edited?,"This book seems to have never been proof-read or edited. There were so many typos and words and sentences that just did not make sense! I think the author tried to save money and did the editing herself. Too bad. By the way, I did NOT order a ""rough copy."" I ordered a brand new one from Amazon.com themselves!The story has some very moving, sometimes horrifying stories in it, but it also has a lot of garbage about the author's big boobs, her boyfriends, etc.Not too mention, there is nothing to show that this book is factual. Author frequently mentions the newspapers that gave all the negative publicity to the nursing homes when they screwed up, but shows no clippings of these papers and makes no reference to anything that can be proven!I don't know about this one..."
5,What might have been...,"A fascinating expertly researched and written study of the growth of a culture and nation much ignored and unknown to Western readers. In many ways theGodparent of the American Democracy, Poland failed to achieve what the U.S.A.has for many reasons. A melting pot culture with the basic Political concept of a free society for many of it's citizens, Poland reached the high water mark in the mid 17th Century. Its decline and fall is told in great detail by Mr. Daviesand should probably be required reading all U.S. schools."
3,Surprisingly good late-QMS,"It ain't ""Happy Trails,"" and Cipollina, Freiberg, and Hopkins have all disappeared, but this is possibly the best of the Valenti-fronted QMS albums, in part because the band is really no longer pretending to be Quicksilver. It's Dino's show from first to last, with Duncan as sidekick, and some of the tunes (""Play My Guitar,"" ""Song For Frisco"") are as good as this team will produce. Of course, there's also some junk (""Out of My Mind,"" ""Rebel""), but most of the songs fall comfortably in between."
4,Quicksilver Without Cippolina?,"I first heard Quicksilver Messenger Service in the late sixties and still prefer the original line-up of John Cippolina, Gary Duncan, David Frieberg and Greg Elmore. In my opinion, their best album was the live 'Happy Trails.'As personnel began to mutate in later albums and Dino Valenti began to control the group's direction, I liked them less and less. However, this 1971 offering is a gem. From the double-tracked lead guitars of the first song, 'Hope,' on through, the writing is masterful and the musicianship exquisite. Duncan proves himself a capable guitarist without the idiosyncratic Cippolina. Recommended."
4,Buy this book you won't believe it !,A collection of stories of the odd things people do and lists that make you wounder how the human race has survived as long as it has.(we are a crazy species)A quick read
2,misleading,I thought this book would give insight on what a baby's different cries were for. It didn't do this. It only stated some obvious observations.
2,vitamin,Our dog won't eat them - the only way we can get them in him is to break them up and mix thoroughly with meat....then he avoids.
5,Good product,"This is a good nutritional product. Most of all, our dog seems to like it. The company was great and shipped promptly."
3,Dog vitamins,I decided to switch my Shiba Inu from his vet-prescribed vitamins as I wondered if they were contributing to his constant itching/scratching (first ingredient in those vitamins was wheat germ)-- he doesn't scratch as much now although I also started using a different shampoo and conditioner at about the same time so it's hard to pinpoint how much the change to Canine Plus affected him -- I do cut the tablets into quarters as he won't eat them otherwise.
1,Dog hated them,"only problem is my hound hates them and they are too big to feed like a pill, very disappointed in this product"
5,happy puppy,"These supplements seem to have the best balance of nutrients. My puppy thinks they are treats, and chews up his daily half tab without complaint."
5,What's Not to Like,"Take Ken Peplowski, the best jazz clarinetist playing today; hook him up with Howard Alden, a masterful guitarist; give them a set of songs ranging from Jelly Roll Morton's ""Why,"" to Lennie Tristano's ""Two Not One,"" from Bix Beiderbecke's, ""In the Dark,"" to Charlie Parker's ""Chasin' the Bird;"" put 'em in the Maybeck Recital Hall, (a redwood-lined performance space that barely seated 50 enthralled jazz lovers); and what do you get? You get this album!Albums like this are the reason that record companies go to the trouble of recording live music. The musicians are ""simpatico;"" the playing is uniformly inventive and technically excellent; the song selection nigh on perfect; Messrs Peplowski and Alden and the audience have a great time; and the sonics, (courtesy of Concord's field recording team), are excellent. What's not to like? And hey, you just can't have too many clarinet/guitar duos in your CD collection."
4,Very subtle...perhaps a bit too subtle,"In truth this is one of my favorite fragrances for men. It doesn't not have any of the strong and frankly overpowering musk of most colognes nor is it too sweet and girly that it leaves people ""wondering""...... Only gripe is that the fragrance does not last. After only a few hours the only way to get any remnant of the fragrance is to sniff hard at where you sprayed, but if you use on a regular basis, builds a nice, subtle after-smell, if that is a word..."
1,What Amazon sells isn't Bulgari,"I love the smell of Bulgari, but this isn't Bulgari. What I received from Amazon just smells like alcohol. When we checked with Bulgari, we were told that Amazon is not an authorized reseller of their products. I'm not sure what's going on, and Amazon has neglected my efforts to resolve this. Bulgari is still great, but don't expect to find that great sexy scent here."
3,De olor fuerte,"Hola, la colonia es de un olor bastante fuerte, rico olor pero a mi no me sirvió por el olor tan fuerte para los que problemas con los olores fuertes."
1,Gross,"This has a really disconcerting note in it. It makes me feel like I'm drinking a cold, savory beverage like V8. Despite it being nourishing your senses are telling you ""something's not right"". The odor reminds of boiled vegetables. It smells so similar to the ""extreme"" version that the difference is negligible. Like BLV and BLV Notte. There was no point in making both of them.Pour Homme is just plain gross."
2,Only for die-hard PECKINPAH fans!,This edition of Deadly Comapnions is a very poor excuse to release his movie for a newer audience. The film itself is a decent western and it is interesting for us that love Sam's films to see his first western. My main concern is the fact that the film is shown in full screen. This shows that even after his death he is still being mistreated by producers and production companies. Most of his film suffer very much from cropping so does this one. I dont mind that it lack any extras but you should at least be able to see it in it's proper ratio. Buy only if you want to see an early Peckinpah film that is real hard to get in these days.
5,VCI transfer is much better than others,"VCI Entertainment has released (February 2013) a new transfer (Roan Collection) of THE DEADLY COMPANIONS, and it is considerably better than the other issues of this classic Sam Peckinpah film. Like some other reviewers/purchasers, I had acquired this Western on other labels, with generally poor transfers. However, Amazon generally prints all reviews of one issue for other issues of the same film. In this case, however, I can recommend the VCI issue. Generally, VCI gives us the best possible quality, and this one is no exception."
4,Good Western,"This western stars Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith. Both are great in their own respects and they would be perfect in The Parent Trap. However, this movie is very different than any I have seen with either of them. It is very dark, with the characters being outcasts and joining together despite some hatred and tragic events that happen early. Many of the scenes are performed at night and in the desert to produce depressing looking shots. This is a good movie but it isn't a typical western."
3,Buy the German Special Edition DVD,"If you can play Region 2 / PAL - DVD's, the German special edition (out April 20th 2010) is the one for true Peckinpah fans: WideScreen 1:2,35, beautiful print. It's the first release with notable supplements: Featurette PASSION & POETRY - THE EARLY SAM (28 min.), Galleries with over 120 posters & stills...Peckinpah - fans might also be interested in my Peckinpah-documentary PASSION & POETRY - THE BALLAD OF SAM PECKINPAH. The 2 - disc DVD set (270 minutes, english language) is available from Amazon.de (Germany) or eBay UK. Check DVDtimes.co.uk for a review."
2,Atrocious video quality.,"I rented this on Amazon instant video because I'm a fan of Brian Keith and my mother is a fan of both Maureen O'Hara and Keith. The video quality is so poor we could hardly recognize them. It's like someone taped it off broadcast TV 25 years ago, then copied it from one VCR to another before selling it to Amazon. If it was a terrific movie I'd stand for that, but Peckinpah directs it like a low-budget spaghetti western. Maybe he had a low budget. I'm giving it two stars, one for O'Hara and one for Keith."
1,Deadly boring!,"This was Peckinpah's first directing job on a feature movie after directing some TV Westerns. The result is very poor. Bad storyline, bad acting - nothing much is working out well here. The director was well aware of it - but blamed it on the producers interference in the cutting procedure. Must be Maureen O'Hara's worst performance ever! Amazing, that the young director made the splended ""Ride the high country"" directly after this misfire!"
1,Don't waste your time!,"Remember when theaters used to show two movies at each showing, Usually there was what was termed an ""A"" movie that was a solid film, a ""B"" or low budget movie, shorts and cartoons.This film should have been listed as a ""F"" film for FORGET ABOUT WATCHING IT!"
3,i make my opinion about the DVD,"I bought this item and i have to say that i dont't see the movie (was a gift for someone else) but i see the main menu and is very poor, just the movie and the menus scene, nothing else, is true the DVD es very cheap, but i expect a little more for a clasic like this; a good thing is the CASE, is a Beauty Slim Case.----------Compe este item y no tengo nada que decir de la pelicula pues no la evisto (era un regalo), sin embargo puedo dar mi opinion respecto al DVD y les dire que lo encuentro bastante pobre, el menu solo tiene la pelicula y la seleccion de escenas, pero nada mas, ni banda sonora, ni biografia del director, ni sinopsis...nada, es verdad que es barato, pero esperaba algo mas. Algo a favor es la CAJA es una Caja de las delgadas (no habia visto una asi) tipo Slim Case, muy bonita y practica.((Escribe en tu idioma es mejor para todos))"
1,"Five stars for the movie, zero stars for the DVD","What a shameful presentation of the first great Peckinpah. 1961 the directorial debut of Sam the Man anticipated not only the Italo Western but most of the other great Westerns to come until Tombstone and Deadwood. The relation of a man who helps a mother to bury the son he killed is one of the strongest love stories ever filmed in Apache county and beyond. Two bruised souls shine bright in the dirt. Maureen O`Hara and Brian Keith, the deadly companions fully deserve a fully restored widescreen release."
3,"""Hating is a subject I know a little something about. You got to be careful it don't bite you back.""","METACOM was a minor VHS company that specialized in operatic and ballet performances. They also had a small catalog of public domain motion pictures.In THE DEADLY COMPANIONS, a would-be bank robber (Keith) accidentally shoots a dance hall girl's (O'Hara) child. To bury the boy alongside a father he never met, she's determined to travel alone across hostile Apache territory. The guilt-ridden killer and his two robber cohorts tag along.Author Sid Fleishman adapted his own novel for director Sam Peckinpah's big screen debut, which is elevated by superior cinematography and an unorthodox music score that includes Miss O'Hara's alto warbling of the film's theme..Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.2) The Deadly Companions (1961) - Maureen O'Hara/Brian Keith/Steve Cochran/Chill Wills/Strother Martin"
5,"CELINES, LA FLOR DEL MERENGUE!","Sin duda alguna Celines es una de las mejores merengueras de todos los tiempos. Este es su segundo disco como solista llamado ""La Flor Del Merengue"". De esta produccion sobresalen los temas ""Te Quiero"", ""Me Falta La Luz"", ""Perdono Pero Nunca Olvido"", y ""Amor Secreto"". Celines es una de las pocas merengueras que siempre se mantienen activas en el ambiente artistico. Celines tiene una voz hermosa que le permite grabar cualquier tipo de musica. Las otras producciones de Celines ""Libre"", ""Al Compas De Un Bolero"" (bolero), y la mas reciente ""Alma Morena"" son tambien de igual calidad como solo Celines sabe hacerlo. Mucho exito para Celines."
4,"Simple, useful tool","This is a simple to read book that has enough information to get the job done. Very quick to go through and create surf forecasts using free data, such as models that you can access on the web. Formulas are simplified, and accurate enough to gauge incoming swells, size, arrival times, etc. Graphics are a bit grainy, and URLs are a bit outdated (book was published in 2004). Overall though, a good tool for the price."
1,Barely worth reading,"This book is a mix of pseudo-science with some heavy handed environmental-green leanings. It spends a lot of time referencing old and out-of-date government websites and barely provides a realistic view of the actual steps that you need to follow to create a useful and accurate surf forecast.A lot of BS is spouts may have been somewhat tolerable if it had come wrapped in a better package. It is rather sloppily put together, the graphs and charts are basically photocopied from internet printouts.If you spend a few minutes poking around any surf forecasting website you can get more relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information about how to surf forecast for free. Don't waste your money on this book."
5,"could not locate R-7 in pet stores in STL,","i tried other ear cleaners.no good,they are missing some ingredients. and they have changed the brands in the pet stores ,just because it has a person in a lab jacket on the product does not stand for nothing, but this product R-7 works great, exact product as pictured, fast delivery, will order from them again.The packaging was great, within the box they put the bottle in a ziplock bag for protection."
5,The BEST ear cleaner out there,"I have 3 adult basset hounds and they require weekly ear cleanings. This is the only product I have ever used that works perfectly. It removes wax build up, dirt and odor and leaves a fresh scent. Other products are either too oily or just too expensive. I have bought this many times and will continue to use it. Thank you."
2,Waste of $$$,"Waste of money not 320. It sounds muffled in a system, buyers beware.I do not recommend. Slowed down and ruined."
4,Mystery Science #11,"Quick delivery-good and/or new condition. Haven't watch the whole DVD, but so far-it's very funny"
3,Indestrutible Man,"I am a 50's sci-fi collector. Some are great, some good and a few bad. I collect them all because they tell the whole story of 1950's sci-fi genre movies. Some you know will be great, others, you hav'nt seen good and some bad. So what! If you are a collector, as I am, they all are essential to your collection to get the ""whole"" picture. Knowing that, it's your decision. Lon Chaney,Jr did not attain the acting status he had in ""The Wolfman"" and some he made shortly thereafter. After ""Wolfman"" it was a gradual down hill slide for him. Knowing what I told you, it's your decision! R.R., Ruidoso, NM"
5,Mikey's gift,"a X-mas present for my son and he was very happy with it, thank you MS3TK for the many hearty laughs"
5,PUMA? WHERE'S PUMA?,"It's worth buying this set for ""Ring of Terror"" alone where the most likeable character is the cat named Puma. The poor kitty gets it's tail stepped on by his dorky owner at the beginning of the film but later is the ""cat""ylst in scaring the lead actor Moffitt to death. This has to be one of the lamest endings ever to a movie. We need more Joel episodes especially season 1 and season 0 from old KTMA days. The humor is more subtle. Joel seems like he's stoned in earlier episodes as well lending to more unique humor."
3,Volume 11: OK,"I don't have a lot of Mystery Science theater experience, but I've seen the official movie, and volumes 12 and 4, and i have to say that these 4 cannot touch those. This volume features joel instead of mike, I guess because its episodes are chronologically earlier, but i just didn't find them as funny as the ones ive seen with mike."
4,Too much Joel...,"I have bought EVERY one in the series, and as long as they are made I will buy them. After having time to watch the difference between Mike leading the show and Joel, Joel is boring. Mike was a writer and then stared as the lead. Mike's shows just seem to be a great deal funnier than the ones with Joel. There are too many episodes in this pack with Joel. I have watched the first 2 and the movies and the comedy are a bit boring. But I will keep watching and buying one of my all time favorite shows."
4,Love it,"I gave a bad revew to another MST3K set, so I am not a totally blinded reviewer of these sets. This one is up to the standard I expected. Fans are too quick to give these sets 5 star ratings, because being an MST3K fan requires a certain loyalty. You feel like you ""get it"" while other people don't.But, you won't even have to ""get it"" on this one. Very entertaining. I used this set to introduce my fiancee to MST3K. She is now a devoted fan, always asking when we are getting the next set. ""Soon"", I answer.....""Soon""."
3,"I couldn't finish it, so how can I rate it?","It might be a must read, but I regard it as a can't read. I could make it through about a quarter of the book - then I had to put it down. I already knew about the atrocities, but reading how they affected this particular person made them seem even more brutal."
4,Halocaust History Must Read!,"I met the wife of the survivor (whom is also a survivor) of the author of this book at the Museum in Washington DC. What an awesome experience to talk with survivors. The terrible things the Jewish people were put through is so disheartening. It is a shame that humans can treat other humans as they did. Written in diary format, a true must read!"
5,Buy and practice with confidance,"Some of the root Tibetan Mahayana Nyingmapa prayers from Guru Rinpoche / Padmasambhava and other Buddhist's teachers have finally been beautifully translated into English. This work of devotion took over 12 years of the author's time and serious Tibetan practice to manifest. Emaho! Buy with confidence.The translator's poetic and musical background capture the song-like nature of these liberating verses to now bring these rare treasures to a serious Tibetan student/practice. These verses will be highly valued by those still suffering committed brothers and sisters in need of pith instructions in English from the ""second Buddha.""Now no longer completely concealed and secret, may all beings find peace, enlightenment and happiness in this lifetime with this highly recommended work of faith and prayers.Future editions may be enhanced by provision of the Tibetan texts and a glossary of some of the more technical Tibetan terms?"
5,One Of My Childhood Favorites!,"Betty Bear's Birthday was one of my favorite picture books as a pre-schooler, and I am saddened to see that it is out of print. It's a very sweet story about a little bear named Betty who believes that everyone has forgotten her birthday until her friends surprise her with a special picnic. The illustrations are beautiful and remind me a bit of Japanese anime. If you are able to find this book, it's certainly a nice addition to any child's library."
2,Bulky designs,"I pre-ordered this book hoping it would provide lots of ideas and inspiration. The designs are bulky and blocky, and I have two boys and I would not put them in any of these designs. I own the Lesley Stanfield and Betty Barnden books and love them."
5,Click the buy button now!,"Rarely does an album come out that is a genre all its own. Owners of records by Taz DiGregorio, the Robbie Jay Band, Los Lonely Boys, etc. will understand what I am saying. Something so truely unique that it is its own thing, but so downright awesome that you'll love it and your friends that listen to all completely different genres will love it too. If you are in the central Ohio area, catch a show. You won't regret it."
1,Samsung DVD Model 711 - AVOID !! AVOID!! AVOID!!,My wife and I received this as a wedding gift and really apreciated the gesture at the time. We have now owned this miserable excuse for a DVD player for over a year and have successfully watched maybe 3 DVD's out of dozens without it skipping and refusing to play the disk. I've heard stories about the US versions of this player skipping and the European one doesn't but don't take a chance. It skips on new and used DVD's. I can't think of many things more frustrating than finally finding that movie you have been wanting to see for weeks in the video store and renting it only to have it stop playing 3/4 of the way through. ... Do yourself a favor - don't buy one of these.
3,Acceptable DVD Player,"This DVD Player is not that great but acceptable. I have not had any problem except it skips sometimes. OK for general use, I guess."
1,DEFECTIVE!!!!,"This very model of DVD player belongs to my roommate. It skips and freezes often, even on brand new DVDs. Sometimes, after removing a DVD from it, I noticed how hot the disc and player were. Of what I do know of electronics, I know that much heat should not be coming from a device that has only one small moving component.Having searched the web for possible solutions to this problem, I have come upon this page and have seen the exact same complaints from other people who have this player. This can only lead me to believe that the entire model is defective and should not be purchased.Please avoid the hassle of this poorly designed piece of machinery. Other DVD players may be more expensive, but at least they work."
2,Very Disappointing,"I recieved this DVD player for Christmas. I was very excited and got it hooked up with no trouble. The instructions for the setup and use of the features were simple. But, as I started to watch the X-Men I figured out I had no sound. I returned the product and returned home with one that had sound and picture. I got home and hooked up the player a second time. I started playing the movie again and about halfway through it it started to skip constantly. I thought it had to be the movie. I played another movie, the Matrix, and it played perfectly. I also played the Skulls which worked well. Then I tried to play The Cell today and about halfway through it it started to skip so badly that I had to stop the movie. This player obviously has something wrong with it. I am returning this player a second time tomorrow and am going to opt for a different and more reccomended player. Maybe I'll have a little more luck."
1,Not pleased at all,"I bought this model last year for quite a bit more than amazon is asking for. The first DVD I bought played perfect. The next four did not. I returned the DVDs, got them back home still didn't play. I had the same problem with the X-Men DVD. I still haven't been able to watch all of The Perfect Storm. I have approximately 20 DVDs and it plays about five of them with zero problems. If I could have ranked it no stars I would have. I plan on buying another one. Plainly put it does not work. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Nice features....that's if it decides to read your disc!,"I thought I received a great bargain when I bought this Samsung DVD player. When the machine finally decides to read the disc, there are many features such as slow motion, fast forward, 3D sound, etc. Beyond that, it had trouble reading a lot of the discs I have in my collection, and some of these discs aren't scratched, but brand new ones. Stay far away from this one!"
2,Christmas disapointment,"I received this DVD player for Christmas. It was fairly easy to set up. It played our first DVD perfectly. We then rented a DVD and noticed that the movie kept freezing up. We thought we had a bad DVD. It played several movies just fine, but it seems the more I used the player the more frequently the problems happened. It will not even play most of my music CD's. I have returned the player to Best Buy where we purchased it and I will now buy the Toshiba that most of the Amazon customers are recommening."
3,Service,I had a problem with the player reading our DVD's. I looked through my manual for troubleshooting and it gave you a very generic and simple (3) problems/solutions (i.e. make sure it's turned on...) There was no phone number in the manual for service type questions. The only number listed was that for a warranty. I then went on Samsung's webpage and it was difficult to navigate through their page. That was equally as frustrating. I eventually returned the player and purchased a Sony.I realize that the problem may have been with the individual player and not an inherent problem in all samsung's. But I mainly wanted to voice my displeasure with the lack of service and alert people to this fact.If I had been able to get some answers (whether I liked them or not) I would most likely have exchanged the DVD rather than return it for a different brand.
2,"Lou, Lou, Skip to my Lou","I am returning this player to the store where I purchased it. Every movie I've tried to play has either skipped or frozen, with the exception of the Little Mermaid 2. Very frustrating."
4,"Good, almost Great.","Got the DVD player yesterday, everything seemed to work great, except MP3s. However, it only skipped on a couple of them, mostly while I was navigating the menus while it was playing. I think that the skipping is probably related to the encoding of the MP3 itself though. The price is right!"
1,samsung dvd711 not what it's advertised to be,"the one i bought for my boyfriend as a christmas gift does not read burnable or rewriteable cd's, as the technical data says it was supposed to do, and it skipped pretty badly on several different dvd's, so I'm going to send it back...buyers beware!"
4,Great DVD Player (MP3 Player Also!!!!),"I bought this DVD player because I saw a review stating that it also Plays MP3s. And YES it does. It even has a small MP3 sigh light up on the front panel when MP3s are being played. Great Picture and excellent sound, and great Remote functionalities."
1,Many problems,"This model was unable to read and DVDs or CDs after being on for about 10 minutes. I have exchanged it and every one has done the same thing. I bought it at a Best Buy and they said many people had problems with this model for this reason as well as it not being able to play MP3 files (one of it's key features). Even in the manual, it says it can't read CD-R disks which would make it tough to play MP3s"
3,MP3 Player,"This is an ok product, especially for the low price. However, it is very complicated to the find files, menus, etc. that you are looking for. Basically you either have to spend 30 minutes trying to navigate your way through the complicated menus, or scroll through lists of hundreds of songs to find what you want. I would most likely spend an extra few dollars to get a better player."
5,Cures really fast,"Purchased a gallon for approx 1000 square feet of new grout. Could have easily got by with 1/2 gallon. Applied to grout and had absorbed in less than 5 minutes. Tested repellant with water, water did bead, but did allow some moisture through. I put on a second coat which also quickly absorbed and no penetration with water that time. Does not darken/lighten grout color, completely invisible. I also used on a very expensive floor medallion with contains black marble and limestone. Did not affect the color or the medallion at all. Applys quickly with a hobby brush. No problem with glazed tile showing contact with the sealer on the edges of tile. No shiny residue after it drys. Have not found any negatives about the product."
5,Great product! Provides great protection.,I did quite a bit of reading before I selected this sealant. Totally worth it. This provides good protection to the grout. I have light colored grout in the tiled area. Putting this sealant did not alter the color of the grouts. I was easy to wipe off from the tiles. I am very happy with my selection.
5,easy for the novice,I did a bunch of research before settling on Sealer's Choice Gold for my slate. I was still uneasy that I'd do it 'wrong'. It was very easy though and turned out water resistant in one coat-- though I plan to recoat when the tile is actually laid.
4,Good product,East to apply. Time will tell how good this product does the job. I'm optimistic.Would recommend based on what I know so far.
3,K,"Please note this movie has absolutely no sex in it. Not even a good imitation of sex. You will see a heart to cover her intimate area. So, there really is nothing erotic about this movie. Yes, it has a story which is interesting. Yes it has lots of whipping. Yes you see lots of breasts. But, if you want to see simulated sex scenes, buy another movie. They pretend to have sex by the man standing behind her with his pants on. Only one scene had a glimpse of a simulated sex scene between man and woman. Sorry, but I have seen R rated movies with sex scenes that were hotter.Movie was definitely worth watching once for the storyline."
2,"Lots of naked women, but lacking in excitement.","I've read and I've read and I've read all the reviews and all the people over the ages who have praised this flick as one of the best erotic films of all time, well PHOOEY!!! Let's just say I've seen a ton of them, and I wouldn't even rank this in the top 25. Lots of nudity and erotic situations, YES. Eroticism, NO! Boring and contrived plot, hard to watch it all the way through, as it's just doesn't hold ones interest. If you want real eroticism, check out Metzger's The Image instead, as it is one of the best."
3,Interesting look at bondage and discipline,"Somewhat shocking but interesting look at bondage and discipline. Educational to those new to the scene. Minimal focus on sex with a majority of attention paid to physical and mental bondage and discipline, dominance and submission. Movie ends with an interesting twist, like the circle of life in many ways."
3,Time does have its effect.,This film is vague as to why O chose to be so submissive and then shadow and dark are used in the scenes to cover the activities. The viewer is left empty by the scenes no close camera shots or vivid display of the sex encountered. Today's xxx videos are far more revealing with both why and what the characters are going through as they participate in this game of sexual submissiveness. Perhaps my taste has been spoiled by the time of my own birth.
1,DVD wouldn't play,"When I put this DVD in my player a message come on the screen saying ""cannot play DVD due to area restrictions"". What does this mean? Is it not supposed to be allowed to play in the US? Can I return it for a playable version? Your attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.David"
1,Will not work in DVD players,The first copy I bought would not play in any if the DVD players in my house. I sent it back and they sent me a new one. It will not play in anything except for my computer. I haven't sent it back yet.
1,Just... bad!,"All I can say is that my favorite French friend was right - this was a BAD movie. It was beautifully shot but slow, pretentious and just lame. Sure, lots of boobies but beyond that, few redeeming qualities. If you don't understand French, don't rent this one - you have a choice of French, or dub-over in English or Spanish but they didn't have the common sense to get subtitling so it just looks BAD. It's like a very long photoshoot."
3,Wonderful 'erotic' film,"At the time I thought this was a great DVD. However, there are no 'subtittles' at all. Otherwise, definitely worth having if you are a '007' fan. Thanks."
3,A bit clumsy,"Somehow, I was expecting better acting, knowing this would be a major undertaking based on a controversial book. Sadly, the film just doesn't work. There's no arguing Corrine Clery's beauty but Udo Kier is completely miscast."
3,"Coulda, Shoulda","This one could have been a lot better and should have been a lot sexier. It kinda misses the mark in all areas, except for the fact that if you can get a girl to watc it with you she'll probably be up for some sweating later on -- due to the erotic nature of the film. I'd like to contrast this with the ""New Sex Now"" video, which, while it is very low in production values, delivers a major payload in the content and expertise that it bestows upon lucky viewers. O, I wish this ""O"" had been something near as good as the book ""Story of O"" which was PHENOMENAL -- but alas, it woulda been nice."
1,Don't Waste The Money,"This DVD is nothing like the Story of O that I read and it makes no sense anyway. They throw a lot of scenes at you without expalining anything. The only reason I understood parts was because I had read the book. This DVD gives no insight, isn't even erotic, and would be plain confusing to anyone who didn't understand what the plot is suppose to be about. If you haven't read the book, your money is better spent on the book. Don't bother with this poorly filmed DVD, that once your done is really only fit as a coaster. 1 star was the lowest rating I could give, the true rating of this DVD is a -3 Stars."
1,No Star if it were possible,"I was so disappointed by this purchase and this film. Being a fan of the book I was very excited to see how they translated it on to film. What I found out is that they didn't translate it at all. They LOOSELY followed the story line and took the liberty to add and change which in my opinion, changed the story all together. I threw this movie away and would not reccomend it to any true Story of O fan."
1,The Hardest Soft-core Disappointment,"The movie's problem is that it takes itself entirely too seriously as a groundbreaking piece of cinema that would compliment the book. I was not watching it expecting dripping porn, but it verged on the unintentionally hilarious. My disappointment takes genre, decade and intent into complete consideration. Check out the film ""The Libertine"" for some sado-soft entertainment."
2,My Low Expectations Were Fully Met,"My rating is primarily based on the quality of the VHS tape. The video is pretty grainy; somewhat like taping off a TV using rabbit ears. I'd seen this movie on tape years ago and the quality was much better then. Perhaps I just happened to get a bad tape, or perhaps the current distributor does a poor job of transfering; either way, I'm disappointed in the video I received.I also found the movie itself a little dated (that didn't really surprise me). It just doesn't have the ability to either shock or excite (according to your own tastes) that it once did."
3,wish the camera angles were better,I wish that whipping and flogging scenes where more in depth. they were ok because of the sound effects and the whimpering but i actually want to see stripes and lashes on female flesh. and blood wouldn't ruin anything. if anybody has any suggestions on movies that i am missing out on some awesome flogging and whipping scenes of women bring it up. and make sure that the whipping/flogging scenes are lengthy and graphic.
2,you're better off reading the book,"The book is amazing; this movie adaptation is quite poor. Although the actress who plays O is quite beautiful, and there are some fairly erotic scenes, this movie is deeply flawed, and I can't recommend it. The plotline gets totally garbled, especially toward the end, to the point where it runs entirely contrary to the book's intention on several key philosophical and psychological points. Second, the actor who plays Stephen is absolutely one of the worst casting choices I've ever seen; doesn't fit the role one bit. So please, read the book. If you've already read the book and love it, it is probably worth your while to eventually see this film, but expect to be disappointed."
2,Movie Lover,"Something tells me that when this movie first came out, it must have been a sensation, now with porn freely available on the internet it is just a lengthy, repetitive bore.Sorry, that is all."
5,You are all wrong!,"This film has nothing to do with humiliation and pornography. This film is about love, but its also a tribute to the sweet art of sexual mind games. The Story of O explores a wide range of sexual fantasies and they must be understood as fantasies and nothing else. The author does not want you to think that any of this actually happened other than in her mind, and now it can happen in yours. For those of you who want to investigate your own mind and are not afraid to ask yourself some uncomfortable questions about your own sexuality will grow with this film. For those of you who does not want any of this, you can just sit back and enjoy some true exciting erotica. I recommend this to anyone, as long as you keep an open mind and do not expect some mindless porn flick, because this is everything but that."
4,Revisited and Loved it,"I was barely 19 and very naive the first time I saw this film - I was shocked. At first, it seemed to be the chronicle of the debasement and objectifying of the woman, O, by her lover. As the story went on, she triumphed by transforming submissiveness into receptiveness, and gains the somewhat grudging respect of her lover/master figure, who begins to see her as an human being worthy of being won. When I could think of what I'd seen, I was disturbed, but intrigued.I saw it again 20 years later and was blown away - taken on the surface it is still disturbing, but there is a tremendous power in how O copes with, and begins to influence the outcome of her circumstances. If you can watch with an open mind, this film is a treasure."
4,surprisingly sexy movie,"I first saw this film at the Old Santurce Paramount theater when it was first released in the 1970's. I was about 15 then and I was bored to death. Still I was curious to see how the movie would look to me today as a 41 year old. Well, it didn't bore me a at all. I found it to be a sexy, intelligent movie, much better than all the ""Emmanuelle"" movies of the era. The movie tries to say something about human relationships, something the Cinemax soft core movies of today avoid altogether.As for the cast Corinne Clery is jaw droppingly beautiful and Udo Kier is his usually strange self. The photography is excellent. I just wished there would have been more extras such as a commentary by someone such as Tim Lucas. Still this movie is worth a second look and will be a good addition to any erotic film fan's DVD library."
3,"""O""kay","Having read the book several years ago I had high hopes for this DVD. The story lines were similar. The book was very descriptive. I had hoped the movie would more closely parallel the book. It sorta did but sorta didn't. More was left to one's imagination in the DVD. Perhaps that was for the movie's rating. The DVD itself was a bit grainy. It was filmed years ago, but I would've thought that it could've been cleaned up a bit when transferred to DVD."
2,I don't get all the hoopla,"I saw the movie before I read the book, so I read the book (online thank goodness), I guess this could be re-titled ""What I Did For Love"". As I understand it the author wrote this as a series of letters to her lover because he said no woman could write like the Marques de Sade. So it seems it was a challenge and nothing more.I gave this 2 stars because the female lead wasn't bad and because the critic complained that it was disjointed, but it was no more disjointed than the book. I would have given it 1 more star but the ending of the movie wasn't even close to the book. SPOILER ALERT! O is abandoned by Sir Stephen and possibly kills herself, she was never in control, just grasping and desparate. Too bad. Nice soft-core porn tho'"
1,Histoire d'eau.,"This movie is more a curiosity than a ""chef d'oeuvre"" (French for masterpiece) of erotism. It hasn't aged very well either... It may have been a hit then, because it was one of the first of its kind - although I am not sure.Coming from my fellow French men, I was expecting a more sensual and passionate love story rather this 2 hours of voyeurism and sadomasochism. I found the movie rather boring, expect maybe for a few scenes. The total exploitation of a young woman for sex and pleasure will be very disturbing to some."
3,"""X"" it is not but more like a NC17","This movie is like your typical softcore porn. While back in the days it was released, it might of been provacative. In todays world, while still off the norm, you would expect to see it on late night cable.It seems to drag at times. So if your not into bondage, you might want to avoid this one. There are better bondage flixs out there that keep you interested in the story."
4,Set aside preconceptions if you can,"Most of us, myself included, have no frame of reference for legitimate sexual servitude. One of the true minority expressions of attraction, affection, and admiration, voluntary surrender of this degree is an almost ineffable experience. Like Anne Rice's Beauty series, The Story of O gives some insight into this world. In the age of feminism, the idea of such surrender is anathema, but following the story to the end we see that O is as much the master as is Stephen. In her perfect obedience, she enslaves the man who knows he will never find such perfect submission and is enchanted.The film is beautiful,as are the people. Taken as eye candy, it is worth the price, but is further and more complex.Recommended"
4,Almost perfect.....,"Just received the disc & finished watching the film. From my unofficial opinion if you have the standard dvd keep it, the blue ray version is only a slight improvement. I took away 1 star because there are dirt spots that shows up here & there through out the film. It appears that Somerville House did not have the original master print to transcribe the film to blue ray to completely remove all the imperfections in the film. Also the film was shot in soft focus so there is only so much room for upgrade in image quality. In closing if you have the standard dvd then stay with it but if you have extra $20.00 to spare then get the blue ray."
4,Fast forward review,"For sleaze fans there are a few minutes worth of excellent stuff here if you do the work of editing out the cutaways into cohesive scenes, but that shouldn't be a problem for porn fans, who are always on the cutting edge.We got four, count 'em, four girl-girl whipping scenes, two very brief and all reaction shots, but still effective. We got a wake her up, chain her up whipping scene, we got a branding (just reaction shots) and some other assorted nudity. Two full and two half stars for the girl-girl scenes and another for the other nastiness, along with a certain amount of credibility for mainstream film reality. I mean, it really looks like they're being whipped. Not like most euro sleaze where it's in slow motion or where the whip is a strip of a soft flannel blanket soaked in a little red food coloring to leave a mark, the ridiculous Jess Franco method."
5,Blu-ray Video and Audio Details,"This is a review of the video and audio on the Blu-ray version only.This looks like a direct transfer from the DVD to Blu-ray, rather than a new scan of the negative direct to high def Blu-ray. In addition, there are several scenes that are from the French version, with what appear to be new, high def white subtitles. These scenes MAY by new scans in high def from the negative, but I'm not sure. There may even be one of two of these scenes that did not appear in the original English version.The audio is generally OK (if low def and mono) except that there are several points lasting a few seconds each where there is a loud humming sound (although the dialog is still understandable).As for content, those who like this kind of thing will like this movie. Done with relatively high production values and with narrative and reasonably believable acting. Soft core but lots of full frontal female nudity."
4,A classic for adults,I was surprised. It had an excellent plot and the acting was just good enough. Me and my wife enoyed watching this when the kids went to sleep.
3,Faded Glory,"I can see where this might have hit the spot years ago, but the constant whippings, fuzzy video, and glazed look on everyones face proved to not meet expectations. Every man was either cruel or sadistic and the women all marched around like robots. Maybe some men found that nice but it made for vapid characters and rediculous situations. Some nice scenes, but not a classic."
1,unuseable,"Had to return, wrong format (for reg 2 users)Should of had a warning for shipping to a USA address. Could not view."
1,Didn't work!,"This DVD was in a format that could not be played on any DVD player in my home or two friends. I could only watch it on my computer. I ended up giving it away. Also, the wrap talked about it being a special edition box set that came with a book and yet I only got the DVD. Total waste of money for me."

1,"Rubbish, Trash, Garbage","I did't like this film. Men screwing women like bits of meat, men posessing womens minds and bodies. This is also why I did'nt find it erotic. But she gets her revenge in the end, this is also the best part."
4,This hits a mark!,"Given that censors can affect what finally makes it onto celluloid I am amazed this film ever made it into the public domain. okay, some may say its tame compared to other stuff but I haven't seen the other stuff! This film pretty much manages to capture the erotiscm of the book and when it works less well it tends to be in this places where the book falls over as well! Some scenes from the book have been cut I think but not to the detriment of the film. I expected this one to be a dog but it's not. If you like your erotica leather-edged you'll enjoy this one..."
3,Story of O,"I bought this at Amazon.com .The movie is as great as I remember from 30 years ago, but it only plays on my laptop. The ad said it was set to region 0 so it would play on any player, none of mine. I am keeping it and I will plug my laptop into the LCD TV to see it in a bigger screen. If you are in the USA make sure a DVD plays in our region.Update: this film did play on my oldest player, that I keep in the motor home. I think it is mpeg compatible."
3,WILL IT PLAY FOR YOU?,"I saw this film after it was released and have no comments regarding the content because it was purchased simply to add to my library of controversial legends. However, I did want one that would work and this one was almost returned instantly when it wouldn't play. It is interesting that three of my DVD players rejected the DVD with the message indicating that it will not play. I patiently went to a fourth player which was able to process the signal and I cataloged the DVD with that particular player. All four DVD players are less than two years old and this is the first DVD that would not work."
2,Where Is The Wisdom?,"I bought this book thinking I'd get a huge list of all of the wisdom of Confucius. But that was the least of what I got. I'm sure there is some wisdome in this book somewhere but the conversation and wording is terrible. It took me 10 minutes read a page, and read again, because I truly had no idea what was going on. Every once in a while, you will come across a straightforward statement that really means something. I'm thinking that this translation does a direct translation to English and it just doesn't fit together well.I think it may be my own intelligence that keeps me from following the wording of this book. Nothing sticks out as great wisdom to me. There is a section that has poems, which are really good, but they don't show me great wisdom. I believe that this book is only for advanced readers."
1,Worthless,"A disastrous work that perpetuates misinformation bout Confucius' life, strips the numbering off the Analects, loses half of them and throws the rest into a jumbled order presumably meant to read as a flowing narrative. Includes contemporary language, but many terms and phrases are badly chosen and clash with the overall tone of the work. Some passages are badly distorted; most of them read like dubbed dialogue in a martial-arts movie. Not recommended for anyone or anything, except as an example of what not to do. Wade-Giles romanization."
1,Not Good,"I know that when you buy a Halloween costume, it never looks as good as it does on the box. That's not a shock. But what was a shock was the total lack of quality in this shirt. It's thin, tiny, almost see-through, and somehow made of pure itching woven into a material. I knew within ten seconds that there was no way I could wear this thing."
5,must be read,"I have read many books about ISLAM and TERRORISM, thanks to the author I have upgraded my perspective and refreshed my faith.I just cant wait to read his new book.Everyone must read this book these days just before the Iraqi operation.Believe me its one of a kind thanks to AMAZON..."
1,Regret to purchase this book,"I got this book long time ago and never had a chance to read it. I recently got some time and want to learn how to use it, and I still have no idea how mysql work after reading for a few chapters. I end up reading the manual of mysql and found some other helpful tutorials online. If you are a beginner, this book does not provide any help."
1,"Yeah, right!","I find this to be a low level of professionalism from this author: ""First, I don't mind negative reviews; this is my 4th book"".To post a positive review to off set the candid reviews from others, I find that to be very amateurish.I have written the author in the past as she suggests only getting some nasty response back from her.If you want a great book on MySQL go with the MySQL Tutorial By Laura Thomson, Luke Welling.The book is written very well and has a 4.5 star rating with no pump from the authors."
3,RELIABLE BUT VERY NOISY....,"I purchased this unit for a single bedroom that has a variety of collectable antiques. My intention was to control humidity levels as part of an effort to preserve the antique items. While the unit operates well and is very reliable, the noise level is a REAL problem both in the bedroom and throughout the house. You can hear the unit rumbling throughout the entire house even though it sits in a far bedroom on the second floor. I would not recommend this product for main living areas or bedrooms. It would only be a good unit in a basement or storage area that few people live in on a daily basis. Otherwise the unit is very well made."
4,Fetilome for leaf miners,The product seems to function as listed.My citrus leaf miner infestation seems to have been brought to a crawl.Price versus amount is high.
5,BEST BOOK THIS YEAR!!!,This book is absolutely thorough and well done. This book NEEDS to be implemented in every health care curriculum. You will never regret picking up this book.
3,"OK, but he's got better stuff","This one is good, nothing great about it.His earlier work shows more style and uniqueness."
4,Very energetic and well done.,"This album, the second of his solo career does not let anyone down. I can best describe ths album as a swinging, ""Jubilee"" of music. It took a while for these songs to catch on to me but they eventually evolved into indespensible classics. The songs are very entertaining and uplifting to listen to. It couldn't start off better with any song other than ""Spider Fingers."" One of my personal favorite songs of the album is ""Country Doctor,"" but I would definately reserve my favorite for ""Walk in the Sun,"" it is a truely great masterpiece. This album is likely to please anyone who buys it."
4,Fun Stuff!,"This is one of those ablums that flies sheerly on the power of the music. The lyrics, it seems, are simply meant to be fun, not to be deep and meaningfull, but this does not cripple the album in the slightest. This is overall one of the most entertaining albums he had put out, with every song being pretty ""up."" In my opinion, the best song on here is Swing Street, just from the drums, and Spider Fingers, because I'm a pianist myself, and, well you can figure out the rest..."
4,The title of the CD is: PAWNS IN A CHESS GAME,"The actual name of this CD is: PAWNS IN A CHESS GAME.The artist name, Gods Original Gangstaz, is NOT the complete title. Amazon has been notified to correct this error."
1,Leaky Valve,"This drain cock is not the one pictured here. The one that ships from AntOnline has a rubber o-ring seal and knurled knob. The one I received leaks, and apparently AntOnline's policy is that I need to deal with the manufacturer or eat the cost and shipping for open products. Not good customer service."
3,Replacement?,"Item works fine, Not the exact replacement I was expecting, it doesn't fit properly in the stylus holder in the Palm"
2,Cheaply constructed stylus,"Immediately after inserting this new stylus into my Palm Tungsten e2, I felt it was not the same as the original. It does not fall naturally into its slot, but needs a helping push into it home position.But, the main problem is the threads on the black top immediately started stripping. Withing a week, it fell off. I solved the problem by super-gluing it back into place, since I don't need that pin-point tip to reset the Palm and I don't plan on using my Tungsten e2 much longer; I just upgraded to a smart phone.Metal Stylus for Palm (PalmOne) Tungsten E, E2 w/Black Tip-=- Craig A. Lance"
2,Not happy,"I received the first stylus in two pieces, with the back end broken off. It was replace, with shipment the same as the first. The second stylus appeard to be fine, but the first day I used it, the back end came off the first time I pulled it out of my Palm. Good thing Elmer's School Glue (when dried thoroughly) worked! Haven't had a problem since. However, the second day I used the stylus, the tip fell off! (Which is why it was replaced in the first place). Again - Elmer's School Glue! Are these things just pieces of junk?"
5,Do Androids Dream of Kosher Knishes?,"In Liquid Earth, advanced robots help humans deal with a reality that melts along a calm Main Street in Shrub Oak, New York. (Some of the robots are religious and seem to enjoy exotic ethnic foods.) Max, a detective, and his girlfriend Mink have to find the source of chronoplamsids that are causing reality fractures. I love some of the funny scenes with the haiku error messages, strange methods of prophecy, and android prostitutes and police. And the bizarre portrayal of God makes one think.....Has anyone been able to decrypt the strange symbolic code on page 128? In any case, buy this book so you can laugh and have your mind warped."
1,Unbelievable...,"What a joke. Weiser should get over herself. I'd give it 0 stars if I could, but, apparently, that isn't an option. What a piece of written garbage."
4,Came as advertised,Quality of book was exactly as advertised and book arrived faster than promised. This is precisely what I look for in buying a used book.
4,"Not for everyone, but good","I am not sure what to make of this book. I was entertained for the first 3/4 of it, but then it turned quite odd, making me wonder why I read the first 3/4. I'm exaggerating of course but I find the ending rather anti-climactic and odd, too open ended even for me to leave it up to my own imagination. It just left me indifferent.With that said, yes, the book was well written (It's Toni Morrison) and I would re-read it. I would recommend it selectively to people that love the odd and symbolic. It is for a lover of literature not the lover of the predictable formulaic novel. Now I remember why I had to write all those papers in college on her books."
4,Song of Solomon,"Song Of Solomon by Toni Morrison is a novel that tells a story about one man's quest for wealth that turns into a quest to understand himself. This journey not only teaches the main character, but the reader, the importance of being able to deal with your past in order to be able to soar. Perhaps the main lesson is : ""If you surrendered to the air, you could ride it."" While this novel may seem difficult to understand at first, everything does connect with eachother eventually, keeping you guessing until the very end. Morrison teaches lessons and shows the trouble African Americans face in a white world. Her writting style is mysterious and poetic, making reading the language of the book just as fun and captivating as understanding the plot and overall message."
2,eh,"I really enjoyed parts of this book, but the ending just smacked of triteness. I found it overall to be a contrived work."
3,i don't see what all the hubbub is about,"man, i am sorry guys, but i just didn't get that into it. i wasn't intimidated by the writing style- i wasn't impressed either. she had some good one line descriptions, but i don't think it is deserving of all the hoopla. i know i am going against the grain, but i wouldn't recommend it. it was a chore to finish."
2,Morrison explores males,"One of her easiest books to understand, it is also one of her more disapointing.It's a traditional coming of age story, boy must find who he is, what his identiy means in the world. He navigates non-communicative parents and black hole pasts.The characters are extreamily creative, vibrant and intreaguing. But the book does not have all the lyrical aspects of her other books and does not seem as deep or thought provoking as the others. But the book is a good way to start reading Morrison, whose style is extreamily difficult, because it is one of the most linear of her stories. But while it stays in a fairly straight line, there are places where she jumps around and you just have to have faith and read on knowing that she'll answer most of your questions eventually."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"Unfortunately, before I had ever picked up a Toni Morrison book, I had heard a great deal about her--the awards, the accolades from the press, the 60 minutes interview, the Oprah interview...I expected great things from this novel. The only reason I was even able to continue on after the first 50 pages was the belief that it had to get better. It never did. With the exception of the main character, the motivations were never understood, and the characters seemed flat and predictable. This book was not worthy of the reviews it got. I can't help but wonder if the (few) people who went to see ""Beloved"" left feeling the same way I did when I finished ""Song of Solomon."""
5,"Truly A Classic - From the Author of ""BrainChild""","I removed the ""Song Of Solomon"" from my aunt's bookshelf (where I have borrowed and read many books) many years ago. She let me borrow it. I read it in two nights. I remember coming home from school, quickly doing my homework, and rushing to see what happened next. When I got my first job, I purchased my own copy. I have, over the course of the years, purchased newer copies, but I still have my first copy. It is truly a classic, as are all of Toni Morrison's works."
4,"Good, but not Morrison's best...","SOS is certainly a wonderful book, as is nearly everything Toni Morrison has written--I have read four of her novels, and haven't yet been disappointed. However, I don't see it as her ""masterpiece."" I felt that Part Two seemed to drag on and on for too long until it became boring. Other than that, however, the rest of the book is captivating and, as usual, is phenomenally written. The ending is also wonderfully open-ended. Still, I don't think it's as good as BELOVED, THE BLUEST EYE, or even JAZZ, which I think is as good as anything else she has ever written, despite being so maddening. Despite its flaws, though, SOLOMON is still a fascinating, interesting read."
3,Shawns review is the bombdiggity word up to my homeboys,"I read almost all of this book but i had to put it down because it was not entertaining anymore. When i first started to read this book ""Song of Soloman"" i didnt really like it. I began reading it and it started to get better. About half way into it it got junk again. I dont really like the style of this authours' writing. It is too chunky and it doesnt flow that good. Although this author is highly praised i dont enjoy her work that much. This book was recommended to me by my mother. She loved and thought i would too. I would probably recommend this book to people that like a chunky style of writing and like to read stories that took place a long time ago."
2,Dense and slow going,"I read this book for the book club discussion group. It is dense and slow reading. I felt like I had 1000 pages read by the end. The end is so wierd, but then all of Morrison's novels are out of the ordinary, odd, and dark. I did get a smile from the author's insight into what happens to a black woman's ( or anyone's, I'm sure ) zest for working class jobs once she earns a Liberal Arts degree. ha ha"
1,Waste of time,"This book lacks the material necessary to warrant the time to read this book. This book attempts to make a point, but falls extremly short. The material is vulgar and inappropriate for younger readers. This book lacks the quality to keep the readers interest throughout the book. The names atempt to make a symbolic meaning, but openly contradicts itself thoughout. Furthermore,the book gives unrealistic portaryals of the people of the time period and the setting. I take direct offence from this book and the contents therein."
5,Astounding!,"I'm a junior in high school who had to read this novel for English class. I had heard mostly negative things concerning Toni Morrison and her writing style and was therefore not necessarily looking foraward to reading Song of Solomon. Please, however, pay no attention to the comments made by the ignorant readers who clearly failed to grasp the message of this rich, wonderful, engaging novel. While I'll admit that this is a complex, challenging piece of literature, it's nothing that the average reader can't handle. I promise you that if you approach this book with an open mind and a willingness to make an honest attempt at comprehending Toni Morrison's slightly abstract ideas, you will be richly rewarded and satisfied. I now consider Ms. Morrison to be one of my all-time favorite authors. I can't wait to read Beloved!"
4,Great Book,"This is one of my favorite books. I recommend that people read this before tackling any other Toni Morrison novels. I like this book better than her other novels because I could understand it more. I feel as if there is less symbolism here than in her other work. She is not as flowery here and uses more ""plain everyday language."" Overall, a great book. It is a good purchase for a home library."
3,The Power of Love,"Toni Morrison, in her novel Song of Solomon, describes the struggles and finally triumphs of Milkman Dead on his journey to find the family inheritance. But, more valuable than gold, what he discovers in the end is himself and the importance of cherishing his family heritage. As he travels through his self-discovery odyssey, he learns most importantly about love--love for himself, his black culture, and his family.In addition, Morrison writes in a language that appeals greatly to the reader. She makes connections from events in the beginning to those in the end through songs and stories--forms of expression to which most readers can relate. She uses symbolism, biblical references, and allusions to encourage the reader to think deeply about her novel.Overall, the novel is a wonderful read and in the end, Milkman allows himself to be swepted away by a very powerful love for life. ""For now he knew what Shalimar knew: If you surrendered to the air, you could ride it."""
3,Song of Soloman,"Fascinating mix of concepts, themes and guttural issues. The story keeps one's attention in its odd or strange focus on humanity."
5,The most introspective book ever written about human life.,"The Song of Solomon is one of the few books I have ever read that made me think so deeply about not only my own life but about the life of those around me. I could relate every character and experience in this book to one in my own life or the life of someone close to me. It painted a very distinct portrait of the African-American experience in America and the life struggle that so many of us face within our own communities and families. The Song of Solomon left me with so much to think about, long after I finished it. It is a timeless classic that will be savored and cherished for centuries to come."
2,Why?,"The accolades for Morrison's are not just over the top, they seriously misguided. Just because her writing is unreadable many think they have read something important. Oprah says its good and its impossible to understand - must be great. No, simply overinflated egos and very bad writing."
4,I see why she won the Nobel Prize,"Song of Solomon will be one of those books that will indeed leave an impact. It is truly a work of art. The story of Milkman's search for gold but finding something else of value is a remarkable one.It's hard to compare this book to her masterpiece Beloved. So, I won't try. On it's own, Song of Solomon is a worthy read."
3,I don't recommend it.,"I was forced to read this book for my English AP class, and was also forced to take a quiz and a test on it. It was unnecessarily vulgar and lacked a climax and a ""tying up of the loose ends."" While the characters were interesting, the male protagonist, Milkman, never undergoes a transformation; he remains the self-centered, self-possessed youth he was at the beginning. And contrary to my teacher's opinion, there is no proof in the novel that he finds true love with Sweet. In addition, how can you praise Toni Morrison, when in her interview with _60 Minutes_ she proclaims her racist views while at the same time wanting to be treated with equality?"
2,WHAT WAS THIS TRYING TO SAY?!!!!!!,"The first 50 pages or so it was really good, but beyond that point it got really slow and it just didn't make any sense and doesn't get to the point well enough. I felt that Toni could've done a lot better and should have been. I wouldn't recommened this book to any one. It's not worth the time or the effort to try to understand it."
5,History Is Identity?,"In Song of Solomon, Toni Morrison takes the view - a common one - that we have to know our history to know ourselves. I don't really agree but in this case it makes a great story. The characters in her novel don't make calculations or follow strategies: they do what they have to do. The history that motivates their actions is an emotional, personal one. Morrison's preoccupation with this personal history is reflected in her use of unusual names: names that are given ""from yearnings, gestures, flaws, events, mistakes, weaknesses . . . Macon Dead, Sing Byrd, Crowell Byrd, Pilate, Reba, Hagar, Magdalene, First Corinthians, Milkman, Guitar . . . ."" Her characters are powerful, larger-than-life people, and clashes between them quickly escalate to life-and-death struggles. At the same time, they have a great capacity for empathy and self-sacrifice. Highly recommended."
5,A Challenge and a Pleasure,"I found Morrison's novel to be one of the more challenging novels I have read, and it demanded a kind of attention from me that I have not received from many other authors. She adds a new spin onto the 20th Century American novel that catapults literature into a new genre. I found the characters to be complex, multi-dimensional, and far from perfect. The ""humanness"" of the characters, the sides of them which I could not always relate but could sympathize, kept me reading to find out where Morrison's journey would end. The greatest part about the novel was that the journey did not end, but rather, opened itself to a range of possibilties. This novel frustrates and tries the patience of the reader, but the end result is inspiring."
3,Strange but a good read,"Macon Dead the III was given the nickname ""Milkman"" when his mother was caught breastfeeding him well into his toddler years. Milkman is a self-absorbed arrogant man living off his fathers money and his grandfathers name. Completely oblivious to his surroundings, Milkman treats the women in his family like strangers. It wasn't until he meets his Aunt Pilate that he shows emotion and gratitude towards a family member. After hearing Pilate's stories of a family long lost, Milkman sparks a greedy interest to the family inheritance. In turn, he is spun into a journey that would teach him about family ties, commitment and love.The Story of family connections when we are well past the halfway point and the reader may struggle through the sub-plots. It is not until the very end that the reader can tie the beginning to the overall story. But stick with it, the stories and lessons they teach are well worth the read."
4,"Excellent, Heart Wrenching.","I don't usually like Toni Morrison novels. Not because I don't think they're good-- I think that Toni Morrison is one of the most talented writers of today. That's the problem. She finds her voice in these characters and channels more pain than I can bear in a novel. She creates these people too well; you're sucked in, and feel trapped, as they do.The novel itself is all of these things. The characters are so vivid that one feels as though they are talking to you. Their pain is so real, that one empathizes easily with them. from Macon Dead to Pilate, to Milkman, this novel chronicles a family over many generations- and their gut-wrenching pain as well.Did I like the novel? No. But do I think that it's worth reading? Absolutely."
5,The greatest novel I've ever read.,"This book is a challenging read but is worth it. Never has a book touched me like this one. After I read this book, I understand these characters and the lives they lead. I feel I know them better than I know myself. While some books end and I wish for more, this book is a satisfying full meal; it leaves you feeling complete."
5,The best book I've ever read!,"I have never been so intrigued by a book or an author the way that I was with this novel. Morrison tells the story so well; I feel as though she is my grandmother telling me a story of long ago. More than just entertainment, the novel taught me so much about life, and what it is cracked up to be."
2,I didn't get it.,"This book IS crazy. I had hoped to use Oprah's book club to get into reading. I read ""Song of Solomon"" and tried another one of her suggestions, but they were just too wierd. I have always read for the enjoyment of it. I don't want to have to analyze a book to try to figure out the underlying meaning. I figure if an author has anything worth saying, they should just spit it out, don't hide it in symbolism and expect people to interpret it the way you intend. I thought I understood this one until I got to the end, but it was beyond me."
3,Slow at first plot? then picked up,There was no plot at the beggining of this book and I found it quite boring. However as the book proceeded it got more and more interesting as questions were answered. However(again) I hated the character of Pilote she was too phony
5,Read the book and go to the web site!!,"Wow, what a great author. These books should be #1 on the bestsellers!! Now, you can also go to Wolf Moondance's homepage at wolfmoondanceauthor.com I recommend this author's books to EVERYONE!!"
2,Best smocked designs for dolls,I felt for 30.00 plus shipping was way to much for this book. I have not made any of the few dresses they gave you patterns in the book.
3,Chip off the Old Bop,"I like Buddy DeFranco. He is a fine clarinet player who has helped to elevate the status of the clarinet in modern jazz. I did, however, find this CD rather mechanical and monotonous. I have other recordings of his which have more flair and feeling. Tony Riley"
2,why is she relevant ?,"boring , left out huge chunks of her life ,what happenned with her son, did he get taken awaw, why? Alot of boring rambling from another junkie."
1,Didn't Like It,"I typically enjoy books about the music scene, but this one was offensive. The pretty girl I remember from the sixties turned out to be a real sleazy lady, not caring for herself or even for her own child.If you want sensationalism, this is perfect for you. As for me, no thanks. I don't read the National Enquirer, either."
4,An absorbing tale of a singular personality and her times...for the most part.,"She obviously had waaaayyy too much fun in the 60's and 70's so the book is a bit hazy, contradictory and disjointed at times. Having said that it certainly isn't boring. She was at the center of the musical/cultural crossfire hurricane for most of her youth and has produced an absorbing tragicomedy of an autobiography that's worth the time of anyone interested in her and/or the times and places she inhabited."
3,"Sometimes I believe her, sometimes I don't","Interesting mix of humorous self-effacement and over the top ego and self-promotion. Sometimes I'm just not sure how much the stories are true, since she claims she's just made stuff up in the past to make money. She seems to think that Dylan was more in love with her than with anyone. Nonetheless, if you love Stones, rock n roll, and her, you'll probably really like the book."
2,This book I COULD put down!!,II would pick it up & read it..some hard to follow..some boring..but I am still reading. I put it down for now.
4,Excellent bedtime reading ...,"from Preface of book: Wouldn't it be splendid if there were a story shop where one might purchase the right story for the right occasion? ---- thats what this book is --- a compilation of stories for K-primary age geared toward character building, spiritual growth & dealing with many different situations."
4,"Hello to the ""reality "" check","If you believe everything you hear from the Bush Administration, if you believe what your told by the media tycoons such as AOL/Time Warner - DON'T READ THIS BOOK!Seeming weened on the internet of unlimited exploration and assimilation, Metzger has an unquenchable thirst for those creative and daring personalities operating ""outside of the box"".With a charismatic passion for the lunatic fringe, Metzger suspends judgment and delves into the psychosis of individuals who dare to examine the means of normative thought production.Knowing first of Metzger's work as an interviewer as well as editor, I became aware of the illuminating and brilliant thinking of Douglas Rushkoff interpreting future media, along with the utopian dreams of Paul Laffoley and Peter Russell. It's true that Metzger ""participates"" rather than ""observe"", but he's clearing taking it all in, and so will you.No other source will give you such an overview of ""reality"" as it is meant to be in real time."
5,Fantastic!,"What a great dictionary! It's like a tiny Lewis and Short (same font I believe), having a few sources for each entry. The best ""on-the-go"" reference I've used yet.Lance"
2,Blank pages offset general excellence,"This dictionary has useful historical information as to usage. Especially helpful to one reading Sixth Century documents. However, the blank pages from the printing run made it less than optimal for use. Returned item."
2,Unreadable Dictionary The Reprinted Edition 2000,"Since I have read a lot of praises about this book I bought it and was astonished to find out that the font size is so small that I have needed a good magnifying glass to have been able to read it. Its other disadvantage is that it's lacking the English-Latin part, so what then, if someone needs to translate from English to Latin s/he should buy another dictionary. It's not a good bargain and I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book based on good reviews here, but I've been disappointed by it. I keep looking up words only to find later that their real definition isn't quite what this dictionary said. Also, at the top of each page, this dictionary doesn't print full guide words, but only their first three letters. For instance, page 352 is not ""ingluvies to inhio,"" but ""ing to inh."" I don't think this really makes things any easier, and it is annoying for words with common beginnings like ""con"" or ""pro."" There are 28 pages of ""con""!"
1,Worse dvd copy ever made,This has to be the worse copy of a movie I have ever seen. the quality is terrible sound and video looks like some grade school kid made it.
4,ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS ~~ REMASTERED,"This 1957 Roger Corman delight has always been one of my favorites as I Love the wonderful Atmosphere as well as the most corny monsters who are at least NOT as bad as the Big Bad Bird from THE DEADLY CLAW - another fun favorite - I was lucky enough to be able to record this gem off TCM so my copy is pretty nice But there is a RUMOR that sometime in 2010 it will be "" officially "" released to DVD with possible NOT OF THE EARTH - another 57 gem! IF this holds to be true all you Crab lovers will finally get your just desserts!!I have always liked the cast in this movie I think they do a solid good job IF they could keep everything the same BUT add with today's technology Crab Monsters this movie could be Spectacular! Anyway stay tuned and on the look-out as ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS MAY grace the video stores with a New & Improved DVD release!happy Viewing ~~"
3,a must for old sci-fi collectors,This movie is a little silly but it is part of the world of sci-fi that made drive-ins' special and fun
1,a complete waste of time & money,i thought it would be better than the cover indicated and i was wrong. if anything the cover was the best part. what i cannot understand is why something so terrible would cost as much as it did i thought for that price it would be fit to watch.
3,Just ok,"It fit well enough but the clips to hold it on are plastic and one never really stayed on at all. After driving with it for around 3mths, I got tired of having to pull up the one side where the clip never worked and now it just sits in my storage closet."
1,Los Bravos,Hello I'm from Spain. I wanted to do an aclaration: Pintalabios is not by the same Bravos ( the 60's spanish rock-pop band)
3,Black is Black,"I'm lookin' for Black is Black. This song is not included on this CD. It's the greatest hit of ""Los Bravos"". How can I buy it?"
2,Where are the Bravos?,"Amazon, ""Black is Black"" is one of the few songs sang by a rock group from Spain that became popular in US. Where are the real Bravos?"
3,interesting,good movie if you like the older classics - good acting - not on the top of the list but worth buying if the price is right.
3,Worth renting,Somewhat interesting story about a man who's life suddenly turns upside down. Barbara Hershey is hot!
2,Whatever Happened To Michael Sarrazin,"Not him personally, but whatever happened to his career? He seemed like such a fine actor in ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They"" and ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud."" He's fine in this film too but once again, the 70s version of the ""rebel"" who won't conform to society (or society that won't conform to him) seems a little dated. One just has to view this film in the proper perspective in order to enjoy it."
5,the pursuit of happiness,"i already knew what i was looking for, so i am very satisfied with the product . thank you"
2,The Pursuit Of Happiness,"The tape was a bit defective in that it had lines through it a lot of times and at times it would get large, then small then large, again, then to normal."
4,Works well,"It's been working for almost 2 years now, and no problems. It installed easily, and is quiet. Easy to hook up."
3,Circulon Elite Nonstick 8-inch Skillet,This skillet is not the same as the one I had previously. The design is different as far as the shape of the pan. Wish Circulon had not changed it.
5,Love Circulon Elite!,"After trying so many different brands of non-stick, Circulon Elite always stands out. The pans are heavier than others, however, they wear very well, cook amazing and their quality is definitely superior to some of the ones I have tried (T-fal, Emeril for All-Clad, Rachel Ray, and most recently Cuisinart's eco friendly cookware - this was especially smooth for the first few weeks but the coating wore off in no time!). I actually purchased the Circulon Elite Skillets in 8"" and 10"", I love the 12"" griddle and I bought the 5.5 quart pan. The lids are glass and clear and generally this collection of cookware is just good quality. I have no complaints so far and I probably will stick with this brand from now on."
1,what happened?,"I don't know what happened. This pot just disintegrated. We didn't put it in the dishwasher, just used a plastic sponge to clean it. We had to throw it out after about 3 months. Bummer."
3,feedback,"Fits well. Feels a little cheap but I guess it matches the price. The only thing I didn't like about it was it goes up on the sides, showing lovehandles. Overall nice though."
5,Excellent for developing a Greek New Testament vocabulary,"For anyone who would like to study the New Testament in its original language of Koine Greek, this is an excellent book for the English reader to develop his or her vocabulary in a systematic and natural way. This makes reading the Greek New Testament less cumbersome by helping to eliminate an overuse of a lexicon. The book is quite comprehensive. --Professor in New Testament Greek, The University of Biblical Studies and Seminary"
4,For Music Lovers Only,"This work is simply to be experienced. The vibes are passionate and limitless. Marion Meadows is truly one of the masters of the saxophone in the smooth jazz genre. The experience of the moods woven throughout is brilliant. Pay close attention to ""Marion's Theme"" and ""Body Rhythm""."
5,Such a Sweet Book,"Excited to give this to my daughter for Christmas, what a gem! Can't beat the classics! I have to be honest though, since its a gift we havent read it together yet, I read through it once and was happy with it"
5,Great Quality Makita Vibrator!,"We use these at work religiously. We currently own 4 of the 12 volt models, and just recently purchased the 18 volt LXT model. Being a concrete company that does alot of state work, we need alot of battery life, since 12-14 hour days without out a charger on hand are a bit hard on most battery powered tools.This vibrator really fit the bill for our needs! First of all the build quality is excellent, very durable through numerous drops and bumps...not to mention various employees sharing the 18 volt model (we all fight for it now)Light weight, which is nice when you gotta hold one of these up for long periods of time.Long battery life-we easily get a full days use out of the battery, or up to 2 weeks with off and on use (without a charge)I'm hoping to upgrade a few more 12 volt models with the powerful 18 volt model in the near future, and its certainly gonna be the LXT model from Makita!"
2,Do not be fooled - It's not the same guy!,"Before you buy or read this book, you should know that this is NOT the same author of _Teach_Them_Diligently_ or _The_Heart_of_Anger_. The author of this book is Louis A. Priolo, not Louis Paul Priolo. I made the mistake and found myself on a wild charismatic ride of Christians who must speak in tongues to be authentic Christians, Christians and even automobiles who can be demon-possessed and other tales colored by what I consider bad biblical discernment.I don't discount the story, but I do want people to be aware that this is not only a different author, but a different theology as well."
3,okay,"first, the remote is too bulky. the manufacturers could have elongated it, instead of making it expand in the front end. that is the only bad point of this appliance. the digital auto tracking is a great help when watching tv. you might not use the trilingual onscreen programming much, but it is a great thing to have. the 19-micron head is a great addition for when watching sporting events so you can watch the good plays in slow motion. this vcr is perfect to have, and the price makes it an even better deal."
4,Hugely overlooked in the states,"Obviously, judging by the total lack of comment here. State of Grace started with a remarkable debut EP that garnered the contract which produced this album, a really fine seamless mix of goth and shoegazer featuring the classically trained vocalist Sarah Simmonds. There are several excellent songs that stand out, but the album works best as a sonic experience to drift through, one of the best of the genre.Unfortunately, the follow up CD didn't work nearly as well and after that I can find no trace of the band or Sarah. But if you like anything like Delerium, that kind of thing, this will be right up your alley. I consider it an essential album, it's that good. Make it your business to seek it out in the cut out bins of the internet."
1,For all of you book burning freaks: here's one!,Thinking like this is what keeps society from fully offering women equal rights. Zero stars for this jerk.
2,poor quality control,"First let me say Amazon's customer service was amazingly GREAT! The monocular was just what I wanted.The problem was a bit of what appeared to be part of an insect wing floating in the eyepiece which would interupt you ability to see frequently. I sent it back and the replacement had the same problem. The second monocular was replaced with a 3rd with the same problem. Since all 3 had floating pieces of different shapes, Amazon concluded that it was a batch problem. Their refund of my money was fast and courteous as was each replacement. While the product was defective, you know you are safe spending money with Amazon and that you satisfaction is assured. GO AMAZON!"
2,"Cheap, cheesy, poor","My current mailbox is one of those ""old school metal ones"". I put it up ten years ago, and I've had to do minor maintenence on it twice since. I really thought that I was stepping into the new age with an all plastic unit... makes perfect sense for year-round trouble free use. HOWEVER! The mailbox was warped and faded right out of the box, and any meticulous effort to install a plumb 4x4 post is wasted... since you're covering it with a curved and distorted mailbox. It does go together very simply, and although it will probably last 629 years in a landfill, I don't expect it to last very long out at the street. Since receiving it, I've ""toured"" the neighborhood and looked at others, they're all warped too. I'm sure it'll serve well to get mail, but I was going for something that will also improve my yard appearance."
3,WOW Atlas,"Good product, do not understand though the additional 10 dollar charge just for a few book marks."
4,If you're looking for an actual atlas...,"and not a cheat book, this is what you want. My only regret is that the maps for the different zones are blown-up screen-shots from the game, rather than a higher-resolution form of the map. They're a bit blurry, but usable. There is information supplied for the location of NPCs and such, but for people hoping this was another form of strategy guide, you'll be disappointed. There is nothing showing plants or ore deposits, nor showing you what skins will drop from the mobs. For that, you're on your own."
1,Beyond poor,"I've had similar problems as other reviewers, most commonly the picture skipping...often to the point that the movie is unwatchable. Now, for the third time in as many months, the player has stopped reading discs altogether. The one-year manufacturer's warranty has expired, but thankfully I bought an extended warranty from the store. My advice: skip this player."
3,"Might be OK, we are having problems.","The one we purchased through Amazon does have an excessive skipping problem. The audio and video skip even during low impact compression. Sometimes it states that it can not read disk even though the disk is new and clean. With some fancy remote work, we can get it play the disk but only after a lot of time. It sounds to me as if there is a alignment issue due to shipping or QA. I think we may send it back."
4,Skipping?...I don't think so.,"After purchasing, I read the reviews and was quite apprehensive. I thought skipping would be a huge problem with this DVD player. Not so. I have watched 1 or 2 DVD's each week on it for the past 2 months and have only seen it skip twice. It was a minor inconvenience but it occured in the blink of an eye. Believe me, I hardly noticed it. I think it's a great DVD player and have had no other problems. I don't think skipping is caused by a problem with the DVD brand or type or the way it was made but maybe due to how it was handled during shipping. UPS isn't exactly always careful with how they handle packages. I have a broken dish as proof."
4,Great little DVD player!,"This is my first DVD player. I really like it. It's only skipped a couple of times so far (I've only had it for a little over a week). It played all of Disc 1 (seven episodes -- 3 1/2 hours) of the _Tenchi Muyo!_ Ultimate DVD Collection with no problems!! In fact, the only thing it has skipped on is _Gone With the Wind_.I would recommend this DVD player to anyone on a budget (like I am -- I'm in college!). It's a really good little player for the price."
3,Not too bad for the price,"FOr the price this thing is not too bad, as it did not give me any problems with some movies that notoriously do (matrix, wild wild west). It all depends on your budget. If you are a college student like me you cant afford to drop 500 beans on a really nice dvd player. However, this one will tide you over just fine till you start making some big bucks in the real world. Overall: 6.5 out of 10"
1,Steer clear of this one!,"The title really says it all: steer clear of this model. I encountered problems in almost every department. The image of DVD movies often froze for a brief moment, causing the visuals to appear jumpy. Sometimes this problem even got worse, making a movie totally unwatchable because the image looked so awful (jaggy, big blocks on the screen at times, constant freezing etc). It even occurred that the player would not accept a DVD disc, which had been played just an hour earlier on that same player. Even with regular audio cd's this wasn't a great player, often rejecting discs or skipping tracks. Biggest disappointment in a DVD player I've encountered so far. Steer clear of this junk and invest your money elsewhere, that's my 2 cents."
1,Don't Waste Your Money And Time!,"This thing is a piece of garbage. In the first six weeks, this excuse for a piece of equipment: (1) Displayed skips in the video an average of 8-10 times per disk, (2) Developed a mind of it's own and began randomly running through a wide variety of functions (including scene-skipping, pause, fast forward, etc.) after viewing any disk for more than about 30 minutes, (3) Displays arbitrary error messages, (4) Locks up the disk drawer (usually with a rented disk in it!) for an indeterminate period of time, usually DAYS. ""But it's 'low-cost',"" you say? ""These things are to be expected,"" you say? Hah! You couldn't GIVE me another Samsung product if you were giving away 10-dollar bills along with it!"
1,Poor performance and almost no support from Samsung,"I actually have the Samsung DVD709, and I thought that the skipping problem that player has would be worked out for this newer model, but judging by the reviews here I guess not! Also, their website does not address these issues, and only after speaking to a friend did I find out there was an upgrade for my player -- but after I got the upgrade, I discovered it wasn't the latest version, and both tech support and the service center gave me the runaround. SAMSUNG TECH SUPPORT STILL HAS NOT RESPONDED TO MY LATEST E-MAIL ASKING FOR HELP. I only bought a Samsung DVD player because I was very happy with an old Samsung TV I own. I also own a Toshiba SD1200 DVD Player, which has no problems at all. If you're looking for a DVD player, DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG. Please, don't put yourself through all the frustration I did. Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions."
2,SKPNG,"I bought this DVD for all the cool features it packs with its low price. It worked well for the first few DVDs I viewed. But then it started skipping. It not only skips a few frames, but entire scenes at times. The skipping is usually prominent when the DVD Player has been running for some time. I also recently got a laptop with a DVD ROM. I then put the DVD which was skipping in the Samsung DVD player into the laptop DVD ROM and it did not skip. So it is not happening just because the DVD may be bad. However, I liked the video quality and the zoom feature. The audio tends to be very low and I can barely make out the words at times. The remote although tiny is manageable. I would really be happy if Samsung has a fix for the skipping."
3,It Skips!,"I purchased this dvd player as my first, I brought it home and was able to set it up easy enough. I popped in my brand new Marx's brothers dvd and started watching... after about an hour I realized that it kept skipping at least once a minute. I thought it might be the dvd, even though it was brand new, so I rented a couple more. One of the dvd's wouldn't even play, and the other one skipped at least five times.I returned the samsung and purchased the Toshiba SD-1600 DVD-Video Player which is only $30 more, I set it up and played all three dvd's without any problems."
2,"Skips, Freezes, Pixelates","I bought the Samsung DVD611 DVD player about two weeks ago. I noticed that with the first couple of movies we watched the scene would freeze briefly or skip. Since we were watching rented DVD's, I figured they had gotten pretty scratched up. Last week, we bought a DVD and tried it out. It worked fine until about the middle of the movie. The scenes skipped, froze for several seconds, and pixelated over and over again. Needless to say, I'm sorry that I was swayed by the low price. I'm taking this one back as soon as possible and will be getting either the Toshiba or the Sony that everyone is raving about."
3,Frame skips make this player a miss,"I received a DVD611 recently as a birthday gift, but I'm returning it ... Every DVD that I've played in the machine has exhibited frame skips at least twice per movie. For me, this is annoying and disrupts the mood of a scene. I end up wondering where the skips will occur on each movie I play. The audio gain is also weak, at least through the analog RCA audio connectors (my TV doesn't support digital audio). I would recommend this machine only to uncritical neophytes for whom the low price is the primary purchase factor. They'll be impressed enough with the resolution and multiple connection options to disregard the skipping problem. However, if you think the machine's quirks would irritate you (as they did me), spend a little more money and move up to something else."
4,I really think this is a great little player!,"As a survivor of the Beta/VHS war, I waited as long as I could to take the dive into DVD. I really didn't have a lot of extra scratch and I am still jealous of my 1,000+ VHS titles, mostly studio editions. I figured that I had thirty days to let this baby prove itself and it did. The picture and sound are phenomenal on my 27"" SONY with SONY Pro-Logic Surround Processor. Skipping has been almost non-existent, even after heavy use (yes, there have been one or two very slight 'freezes' on most discs but the sound stays on track so it's not a major inconvenience). Try this machine...I think you'll love it!"
4,Nice basic unit for the bucks - and it IS DTS capable,"This is a no-frills player, but it does a nice job and offers lots of features - particularly DTS - at a very attractive price.Some reviewers have had problems with skipping, but I had this problem with only one movie, and it was a bad disc, not the player.The user interfaces could be better, and I wish they'd put more controls on the face of the unit instead of the remote (my four-year-old LOVES to hide daddy's DVD remote!), but overall I'd recommend this unit pretty highly.For the price, you can't go wrong...but for the same price you CAN go wrong with other units."
1,Samsung has skipping problems,"I got the Samsung DVD-709 as a gift and it seemed to play DVD's well until we rented ""Mystery Alaska."" There were several scenes where the player would skip and then freeze. We thought it might be the DVD, so we exchanged it for the same movie at Blockbuster and found the same problems. It would even skip in the exact same scenes.It has a lot of nice features like 32X FFWD and RWD. Also, 2X and 4X magnification. Not to mention DTS and Dolby Digital compatible. I just can't live with the skipping though.I guess with a lower price you compromise quality. Sticking with the larger name brands like Sony, Pioneer, Panasonic, Toshiba, or Sharp seem like a much better and safer bet."
3,DVD Player,"I found this to be marginal...OK to use as a second DVD player, perhaps in the bedroom. A little jittery, with occasional pauses, but still a crisp picture."
4,EXCELENTE PROMEDIO,"ESTE EQUIPO SIN ENTRAR EN DEMASIADAS DESCRIPCIONES Y CARACTERISTICAS QUE SOLO LAS ENTENDERIAN PERSONAS MUY INFORMADAS, SE PRESENTA COMO UNA MUY RECOMENDABLE OPCION DE COMPRA POR SU BRILLANTE EQUILIBRIO ENTRE SU BAJO PRECIO DE COMPRA Y LAS PRESTACIONES QUE SE LOGRAN"
4,Cry of the Innocent,I found this movie to be sad but to have a suspense thrill to it. Rod Taylor's family are killed. He looks for the people responsible. Along the way the are twists and turns. I enjoyed it.
3,Lavish illustrations but too few recipes,"I bought this book shortly after it first came out, in hopes of improving my Passover repertoire. Passover can be a true culinary challenge for those who keep kosher. No pasta, no pizza, no sandwiches--and two major ""dinner parties"" (seders) to give! There's nothing like a batch of new recipes to liven up the menu.Frankly, ""The Passover Table"" was a disappointment. The book only has forty-three recipes, and many of them are for old standbys like chicken soup, matzoh balls, chopped liver, roast chicken, and a very basic pot roast. For those, any Jewish cookbook will do. Friedland includes a number of interesting Sephardic recipes, but they're not enough to justify the price of the book. The illustrations are plentiful and generally very lovely, but their lavishness underlines the thinness of the content. As for the recipes themselves, I've had a 50-50 success rate for the ones I've tried, and I've had minor problems with most of them."
2,So-so....,"A second tier cookbook on an important subject. Nothing new here, nothing exciting, just a mediocre presentation. Too bad."
4,Sweet,"Disturbed, Chevelle, Taproot, and Unloco, not a very good combination, since the only awesome band is Disturbed in there. The only song I like from the other bands is 'The Red' by Chevelle. The Distrubed part was awesome, their cover for 'Fade To Black' was infallable, proving once again that they are the future of metal, shock-rocker Ozzy Osbourne was right."
5,Relaxed beats and excelent vocals,"I received this CD from my Dutch friend, and after 30 seconds I was hooked. The beats are so chill, they could almost fall into the trip-hop genre. The album is produced very well and every song brings its own little gift of musical joy. ""Seriously though,"" this is a really good album. If you like underground hip-hop or just good beats this is for you."
4,Great single volume history of Truman and the bomb,"This was an amazing book. My father is a history teacher and there were things in this book that not even he knew. Wainstock adeptly guides you through the Japanese situation in 1945, history about the bomb and the scientists who made it, the Potsdam Conference and Decleration and Truman's final decision. Packed with quotes from both the American and the Japanese this book is an unbiased account of the atomic bomb."
3,Always in good voice,"The man is always in good voice, and the band here is tight, although I don't really need the hoo-hah that goes with some live dates, like ""Hello-o!"", ""I can't hear you!"" and stuff like that.A friend told me that this CD would give me a full plate of ""If you're gonna step on my heart"" - type tunes, but this isn't it. From the audience reaction when he starts ""I Pity the Fool"", I think I'm not alone. But he even plays that up-tempo, and something short of full length.Anybody have any suggestions?"
5,I feel like I found buried treasure,"I, too, had searched for the Loretta Mason Potts book, long before the internet was invented. Since elementary school (in the late '50s) I thought of it as my favorite book. When I became an adult (with kidlike tastes, still), I went back to my elementary school to look for the book (still before the internet). No luck. They didn't even have a record of it. I thought I'd made it up, and forgot all about it. Until last night, as I was falling to sleep I searched my brain for the name of this book. I remembered the name. I woke up thinking about it. I haven't bought it yet, but I read it when I was a little girl and thought I'd lost the opportunity to read it again. Thank you Amazon, for offering this treasure of a book."
5,Impossible!! I wasn't dreaming!!,"Like so many of the others who have reviewed this book, I have wonderful memories of reading this during elementary school--at least a couple of times. I vividly remember reading this during Christmas time, curled up on our couch with the lights on the Christmas tree, reading this book for at least the second time. I even remember that the cover, without the dust jacket was a peachy-tan color. Alas, I don't recall alot of the plot, but I do know that I was able to retain the title with great clarity for over thirty years. My kids are too young to enjoy this book yet, so I will re-read it now and they can enjoy it in the furture. I am currently reading the Harry Potter set of books and that made me recall books that I wanted to read over and over again, as so many young Harry Potter fans want to do now. I am preaching to the choir I know, but Loretta Mason Potts is a wonderful book for those who loved fantasy as a kid and still enjoy the escape now!"
4,Well-made outdoor boot.,"This Danner boot could be called ""extreme"" quality. This is a fine boot, but beware, it is quite stiff and needs an extended breaking in period. I recommend the purchase of this boot as a solid hiking shoe, a work boot or even a barn boot. It is also one of the most attractive boots I have ever owned and I am complimented on it regularly."
2,They don't stick together very well,"These would be great if the magnets were stronger - as such they barely hold together. It doesn't help that the plastic is very slippery as well, the pieces easily slide off of each other. Building some of the larger, more complex shapes in the illustrations is very difficult."
3,Tricky to figure out,"The blocks fit a certain way. Hard to put pieces together without a lot of shifting around. Not the best on the market. But bright colors and different pattern card 'challenges'. All in all, just okay."
3,A Bit Tricky for Little Hands,"I bought these for my soon to be five year old nephew. While playing with him, I found the tiles to be tricky to put together without them collapsing in on themselves."
2,Not worth the price they ask for these cards,"I ordered 2 two deck poker cards. One of the decks had 2 cards that had black marks on both sides of the cards. The decks also felt gritty. They were not smooth, but were very slippery. My Mom has plastic cards that are very smooth and looked like half of the depth of the Da Vinci Ruote cards. I will be sending them back. This was very disappointing as I love my Mom's plastic cards, and I have been looking everywhere for some, I was hoping I had found what I was looking for. Very disappointing for the price they ask for them."
3,Hard case was broken,The hard case housing the two decks were in multiple pieces and the packaging was decrepit. I still give it 3 stars because the cards are holding up okay
5,Great cards,We love the cards and the card case. The cards are stiffer than our old ones and easy to shuffle and deal.
5,Playing Cards,Playing cards are of good quality and we are happy with them. Recommend them for ease of shuffling and handling.
3,Pigment is a bit off,"I like these cards--the price is right for sure. I have been using KEM cards for around 15-20 years and have managed to tear through several sets of those.It seems people do have their tastes, but I have noticed that my Da Vinci set seems to have printing with less ""pop"" (for lack of a better term). The reds not as deep, the blacks not as solid, and and the ornateness/detail in the pattern somehow just seems flat.They do, as others have mentioned, have a bit of a rougher texture to them--I'm not sure this is a plus or minus. Also I could not swear which are thicker--these or the KEMs. If pressed, I may say KEMs. But they are finished differently--the KEMs have a semi-gloss finish of sorts and these are more like eggshell.All in all, hardly a purchase I regret, and I would by more of these."
4,Warranty,"The cards are awesome. I love these cards, hands down the best cards i have ever played with. The only thing i can not agree with is the fact that Life time warranty is advertised but in actuality it is just replacement info that you have to pay for. Roughly a $1.50 per card. Not bad and i think is reasonable but shouldn't be advertised as life time warranty makes people think replacement card(s) for free."
5,Can't fool me---I'm Italian!!,OUTSTANDING and FABULOUS!!!!! Her recipes are so delicious and her cooking tips have allowed me to adapt my mother and grandmother's regional recipes into healthier versions. Try Ms. Woodruff's version of Tiramisu---I serve it often and it's to die for!!I collect all her cookbooks because the recipes taste authentic to the higher calorie ones. Good food is all about nutritional value and flavor. This book is a winner!!!
2,Portions are not accurate,"I made the Rigatoni in Spicy Olive Sause. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup of rigatoni. This is not enough to feed 2 people. The sauce 8 plum tomatoes chopped also was not enough. This is the only recipe I have made. I am not pleased. If the recipe was for one person, it should have said so."
4,Hot and Classic,"This is the first book I've picked up from Brava on a recommendation from a friend and *boy!* was I not disappointed.This contemporary story appeals to the most contemporary of girls. But the larger appeal is the classic guy/girl love story. Eric and Amanda are attracted to each other instantly, but both must keep perspective because of their business relationship. The deeper story contniues with both Eric and Amanda needing to overcome past hurts and this is where the classic storyline connects. The fact that both these characters appear to be alpha-beings make their characters a little too unbelievable sometimes, but the hurts they've experienced in the past is what makes this a realistic read. The intimate scenes were hot, the getting-to-know scenes were touching, and the peripheral players were funny. Glad to see this new author starting off with a bang!"
3,Drop the Thesaurus and back away slowly!,"The individual characters I love . . . The story line was great . . . the overuse of (as my grandmother would put it) 25 cent words REALLY got on my nerves. Who outside of an ivy league classroom actually uses the word ""emaciated"" in basic conversation with a friend your trying to cheer up. The overblown words kept pulling me out of the story. This was my first Lucy Monroe book and while the storyline appealed to me and I loved the characters, I will probably not be inclined to spend full price on another. Overall I would recommend this book to others, but with the warning that at certain times you are going to want to scream from the constant barrage of over-inflated writing."
3,meh,"I'm a little over what I think is halfway and the story has neither been bland nor captivating. The female lead is so insecure she is coming off as desperate in her efforts to gain approval...the worst part is her certainty about her feelings for him (love she calls it) when neither she nor even I, who is reading the book, know the characters well enough yet! at this point I'm just going through the pages so I can finish..."
5,Favorite!!,Lucy Monroe did an amazing job with this book. Amanda is sweet and relatable in the way that she tries to keep everything together after everything thats happened from her previous marriage and with her family. Simon enters as the smokin hot hero that shes really been waiting for. Hes sweet and caring and is determined to mke her understand how great she really is. If anyone knows where to find a man like Simon feel free to let me know.Overall great book.
2,Good tips but outdated photos,"The author gives some good tips on color, basic items to buy and styles but the photos are terrible. They are extremely outdated - who wears denim jeans with animal print and belts printed on them? Or jeans splattered with paint that look like a bad spinart project. The few photos that are in the book are very outdated. The author also trys to pair a scarf with everything. Maybe I'm too young for this book but I was trying to find something that would show me how to put together a professional look. I'm still looking."
5,"wonderful illustrations, and unusual story.","helps to show children that people in their family can be different, but you still love them."
2,Tito,"I got this just for ""I Like It Like That"" because I couldn't find the Blackout Allstars single anywhere. A lot of this release, Tito sounds like he's trying to be the Latin Barry White."
1,product not delivered,"Product was not shipped. A different product was received. When the wrong product was returned I asked to have the correct product shipped. There was no additional communication until I questioned almost a month later. I was told then that I was not being charged for the product, but my request to have it shipped to me was ignored."
4,Titus,"I really like this series ,very funny, but it doesn't have subtitles, I think is very important and necesary in all dvd's."
4,Very happy,"I LOVE Titus! I was very happy to get this!The price for it was not that great being it was used, but I was very happy to get it that I didn't care so much."
5,Up There With the Best,This is my initial acquaintance with Jimmy Bruno on disc and it won't be the last. He has an impeccable technique and is able to play rapid passages where each note is cleanly articulated. At the same time I personally was emotionally drawn in to the music and have been playing his disc over and over. It is nice to find some one who has been outside the awareness of most jazz enthusiasts and yet is a player of the first rank. A real find for me.
4,High class guitarplaying,"Jimmy Bruno is, no doubt, a very competent guitarplayer. But somtimes it seems to me, that it is more important to him to play solos in a very, very fast tempo, than to think of the ""music"" in his solos"
3,"If you are a fan of the early classic poetry of William Wordsworth, you will enjoy this small text.","As a long time lover of all kinds of poetry forms, I decided to order this particular long Ode poem of William Wordsworth. Having read several of his previous collections I looked forward to reading this volume. Probably the most famous stanza in this poem is number ten. ""Though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower; We will grieve not, rather find strength in what remains behind."" In fact, a movie came out with the title ""Splendor in the grass"" that helped make this particular Ode poem more popular.I do think the price is high for such a short poem book; nevertheless, for those who are fans of William Wordsworth poems will find value in this small volume. Poetry lovers will find this poem very meaningful as it relates to anyone's youth and the dream of immortality.Rating: 3 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Haiku Moments: How to read, write and enjoy haiku)"
2,Missed A LOT of exam areas,"First off, I found this an excellent reference book. I readit cover-to-cover and found it dense and full of usefulinformation. I intend to keep it at work for reference.However, this book was NOT useful for the Linux+ exam. I usedSelfTestSoftware.com's Linux+ material and this book and missedthe minimum passing score by two questions.I have four years UNIX admin experience (none on Linux) andan MS in Computer Science. What I don't have is a hardwarebackground, and that's what they're looking for here. Thereare a lot of references on the Internet to how many hardwarequestions there are on this test - believe it. This testreally seems meant for hardware tech guys and unless you'rewilling to study A+ certification books or have a bunch ofLinux experience I'd recommend going for a ""Linux"" certificationthrough one of the other companies, rather then this hybridcertification that is only considered a ""low-level entry Linuxcertification."""
3,"Ok reference, except for the typos and mistakes","I have 5 years of Unix experience, and several years of Linux experience. I bought this book...on sale. It's not worth the full price...Reading the book was pretty easy. Most examples are clear, the book is small and easy to read on the train.However, the downside to this book is the number of errors. Simple typos are forgivable, but there were problems with practice test questions, diagrams that contained errors, etc.What's even more frustrating is that Informit/Coriolis doesn't provide any Errata on their website, so I can't find a good explanation for some of their test questions."
1,Arrived Broken,"I'll come back and review this after the return process is done- It arrived broken. The packaging was shoddy for a ceramic pot. It is a beautiful item, and I'm going to purchase another one, but right now all I can review is how it arrived. So yes, I understand that I'm not reviewing the item. I'll do that after I get it"
5,Das ist wunderbar!!,Just the right thing for the woman who has everything. I received this as a gift and I simply love it. Wonderful sauerkraut!!!
1,"Poor shipping, no option for exchange","This item arrived broken, and there was no option for exchange. I've returned it via Amazon's (free) process, and will be ordering another one. Hopefully this one will make it safely."
3,Transcending transitions,"Covered in kitsch, it is still impossible to deny many of these dated compositions do not hold visionary moments- the fun is feeling those exact transitional moments, where corniness subsides and immortality resides."
3,50's film retro,"Listening to this album takes me back to the 50's. It's like being in a time warp! I like the way it was able to capture the sounds of things familiar, when things were simpler and music was full of everyday emotions."
5,SO easy to change,"Love this product, I had never changed a strut on a front wheel drive car before, and this one took me all of ten minutes to do. It just goes into place, you put the 5 bolts of nuts back, and you are done. It was a amazing"
2,practice test questions in back of book not on the test,"very disappointed when I took the test and did not see the type of questions in the book on the actual test. I concetrated on that more than the reading. Look for another book first before buying this. This book is informative, but did not prepare me well enough. I dont know if it was me or the book."
3,It gets the job done,"It's not a great book, but it gets the job done. Several questions even in the sample tests simply are not related to what you find in the text and the real test also has a number of questions that the book doesn't answer. No reason to learn the book by heart. Common sense counts for about 40-44 points (50 = pass). You'll be ok."
3,About 60-70 percent of the material was on target.,"The review material consisted of over 120 pages of dense information and three tests. Before I took the test, I would not have thought that any questions on the exam could possibly have been skirted over. I was wrong. Since the minimum score for credit is fairly low, I feel that this book is sufficient prepararion for the exam. The review material is so packed that you will feel that you have earned your credit after you get your scores."
3,Helpful but confusing,"Inasmuch this book covers the information on the clep exam, it fails to thoroughly explain many psychological concepts. (Refer to Santrock's Intro to Psychology for comprehensive explanations)Questions in sample tests are frequently confusing and lack clarity.I took the clep in August of 2000. There were NO questions on the brain, eyes or ears. Primary focus was on the theories of Piaget, Erikson and Freud. In addition to the aforementioned theorists, have a complete understanding of classical conditioning, operant conditioning and all the consequences attributed to an underpriveleged childhood.P.S. Know PKU"
3,Did OKAY in exam,"I did the CLEP exam today. I studied this book and did all the tests at the end, but also followed the advice of previous reviews and read other Psyc books. I did not do marvelously in the test, but I passed with 10 points to spare. So yes, it is great to use the practice exams and see which areas you need to brush up on, but definitely use supplement material - I used ""Infants, Children and Adolescents"" by Laura E. Berk, and found it very helpful and detailed (as well as interesting). Know the major psychologists and theories, and some biology."
4,Try this book - it won't hurt!,"I read this book cover to cover and paid attention to the detailed answers in the back. I also supplemented this with a college textbook, which I don't believe I needed...probably wasted my time. CLEP tests are not that difficult; they're well worth the $50 or so. I passed with 16 points above the required 50 and had 42 minutes left on the clock. I saved $350 and spared myself the 3 hours a week in the classroom plus study time. Be sure to make educated guesses on the questions you don't know, points aren't deducted for wrong answers anymore - who knows, you may even guess correctly!!Try it - I'm sure you'll pass, too! Good luck!"
4,I passed,"I did pass the exam. But a lot of the material in the book is not even covered in the exam. I would avoid the whole section on the brain,ears and skeletal system. Fortunately, I went to the collegeboard.com site and downloaded the study guide for that exam. I realized that only 5-7% of the exam dealt with the brain/ear so I didn't even bother to study for it.My advice would be to get the study guide from their website and use that as a guide. Good Luck!"
3,I wouldn't have passed without this book.,"I read the book twice, a chapter or two at a time during my lunch hour, and worked the review questions on the weekends until I felt comfortable with the material. It took me approximately two months. The bottom line is I wouldn't have passed the test without this book; it was my only real study guide. I knew very little on the topic when I started reading and in the end scored twelve points above the minimum needed. Just so you know...there were several topics on the exam that I did not see in the book, most were, but not all.Best of luck to you..."
1,Pulpy Fiction,"This book was like reading two books with different plots, one part slasher /killer book the other Nazi camp horror... neither of which were any good. Unless you like to waste your time reading pulp I would not recommend this book."
5,A Classic!,"I've got to admit that I've never really liked the music that U2 released after 1990. I thought their CDs during this time period were filled with some bad to mediocre songs mixed in with some gems.I received U2's ""Best of 1990-2000"" CD as a Christmas present and I was pleasantly surprised. It contains all the gems. I was so pleased that I went out and purchased the DVD.I had previously seen only four of the 16 video clips on the DVD so this was an eye-opener. I wasn't disappointed. I think this DVD will become a classic.If you purchase this DVD, there's an empty slot to store the limited promotional DVD ""The History Mix"" that is included with some of the ""The Best of 1990 - 2000"" CD."
1,a DVD full of (BED) surprises,"I've just bought the 1990-2000 DVD and it is full of (BED) surprises:I can't get the Dolby Digital sound on my DVD player, I can't play the DVD-Rom on my iMac G4 computer and there was a PAPER DVD inside the box. Isn't that something!!..."
1,As awful as it possibly might be,"And this is from someone who thinks that U2 music and lyrics are in the top echelon of rock music accomplishments, next to those of Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, Nirvana. Let me be frank here: these videos, with the exception of Wim's spot and the footage from the 1992 gig, are an evidence of total lack of creativity and spirit. Period."
2,Hello! What about the dolby digital format among others,I am a U2 die hard fanBut I really cannot understand this U2's tendency to produce black and white videos or use stereo audio formats.Bono we are in the 21st century BroYou better react or will be compleately out of timesPlease hear us
3,Okay quality,I am not sure whether the video was like that or its only this DVD but I couldn't find the quality to be great. I really love U2 songs but this DVD quality disappointed me.. I can give 3 stars only for the good collection of songs.
3,Hands full of mysteries...,"Nancy joins her sleuthing pals' mystery solving club for fun and attempts to solve 5 mysteries. Well, I admit that each mystery sounded exciting and intruiging, but was solved way too quickly with little thinking. They were not mind-bending or brain frying or anything that was very puzzling. the clues in each mystery were also way toooo obvious. However, the mysteries turn out to be linked in a way that is not very clear.You should still buy this book, if you have money to spare. It's simple and kind'a boring, but I guess it is still fairly okay."
5,Great fun,This brought back so many great memories. It made me laugh out loud constantly. I would recommend this to anyone who grew up watching PeeWee.
5,The Pee-wee Herman Show on Broadway,A must have for all Pee-Wee fans. It is good to see Pee is back!I hope there will be more of him.
4,Great Play for us Old School 80s guys,"I grew up with Pee Wee. He was an idol of mine, I don't think I would be the same if it wasn't for him. I own every episode of the Playhouse on DVD and his 2 movies, plus the original play that started it all. The only thing I didn't like about it was how the script was changed to make it ""dated"". The original play could be watched at any time to any generation and it would make sense. The new play brings in the internet and other technologies/jokes that date it to right now, so when I watch this again ten years from now it'll feel dated."
4,Perfect to Sing Along to!,"I was introduced to From Good Homes music only a year ago, but I have been hooked ever since. I was lucky enough to catch their last concert at Waterloo Village (8/99). Open Up the Sky is a great cd if you're: in a good mood, bad mood, and especially driving. It is upbeat and perfect to sing along to. Hope you enjoy it!"
2,Caution: Windows 98 only!!,"This book is only useful if you are hooking up PC's running Windows 98. If you have any other OS or want to connect to a Mac, this book is totally useless."
4,Good book for novices to get their home network running,"The title says it all. If you follow the steps given studiously, you should have no problems planning, purchasing and setting up your own home network, provided that you stick to the basic configuration of Win98, Ethernet, and dialup through the phone line/DSL connection. Nothing ""fancy"" like WLAN here. If this seems incredibly simple to you, there are thicker books out there.This is one book which can be read easily from cover to cover, not least because of the large typeface. I felt very comfortable with it; there is no feeling of being ""talked down to"", or being overtaxed with jargon. The many pictures enhance the user-friendliness, apart from those which are rather grainy in quality or which do not convey much useful information due to the lack of creative use of graphics."
3,Home Networking,Very good book visually. A bit older technology than I expected. Would definitely recommend to a novice at setting up a new network at home or in a small office...
2,Build Your Own Home Network,You learn more about networking in computers 101. To say follow the wizards is not enought. There is no help if something goes wrong. The book is not worth the money I will put it in the trash rather than sell it to someome else.
4,A funny book about cancer?,"This is Tania Katan's own story and she tells it with a wonderful balance of frankness, humor, and tenderness. Katan comes off as a ""whole"" person in her writings, which isn't something we often see with lesbian 'characters.' She's not just a lesbian or a cancer patient, but also a daughter, sister, lover, friend, coworker, student, etc. A great, fast read.[...]"
4,A different book ... a different perspective on cancer,"I saw a short article announcing the book's release in a magazine and thought it would be an interesting read, because you seldom see a humorous look at something we deem as ""not a joking matter"". WOW! Let me say, this book is more than just about someone getting cancer. It's about family and friendships and no matter how quirky your family is and how toxic some relationships are, you can still come out on top even when you've been hit not once, but twice with a life threatening disease. Tania is my hero. Very inspiring story. You'll find yourself scolding her in some parts and emphatically cheering her on in others. I definitely recommend this book. You will not regret it."
4,Short but not shallow - moving but not mushy,"Katan's story is not a typical breast cancer survivor success story - in part because she got hit twice, once at 21, and again ten years later, just when she thought all was well. Katan deftly shifts between flashback and present-day in comparing and contrasting her experience with each cancer and its removal. This is a easy read that will nevertheless leave an indelible impression."
5,Great Elvis tunes,"Three Elvis movies with great songs on all three. Flaming Star has some songs that really show off Elvis' early talents as does Wild In The Country. Follow that Dream is my favorite with every song a hit. This CD has to be in your collection, if not, get it. You will not be dissapointed if your an Elvis fan like myself. Of course if your an Elvis fan, you would already know these songs from other albums, thats what makes this triple feature so great all in one CD."
3,Stay single and save a dollar.,"What we have here are three Elvis soundtracks on one CD. The songs were recorded in 1960 and 1961. None of the movies are Elvis ""formula"" pictures, and they feature less songs than a typical Elvis movie.Flaming Staronly had four songs recorded for it. ""Flaming Star"" and ""Summer Kisses Winter Tears"" are very good songs. ""Britches"" and ""A Cane and a High Starched Collar"" are not very good songs.Wild in the Countryhad five songs recorded for it. All the songs are good. In particular, ""Lonely Man"" is a great ballad and ""I Slipped, I Stumbled, I Fell"" is a fun, goofy rocker.Follow That Dreamhad six songs recorded for it. The songs are good, although ""Sound Advice"" is somewhat weak. ""Follow That Dream"" is the best song, but ""Angel"" and ""What a Wonderful Life"" are almost as good.Elvis fans should enjoy this CD."
4,Great for sports,"The Marware case for the iPod Mini is a great product for the value. The armband is excellent, very comfortable - even for jogging or weight lifting.I have two small issues that bother me about this product:1. The case has an opening in the bottom for the iPod USB/Firwire cable. The plastic doesn't want to close well and constantly opens.2. The front cover has a place to store your earphones, which is very hard-pressed. It could be easier.Over all, the product is in high quality and very recommended!"
4,Kevlar for your ipod,"The sportsuit makes the mini larger, a fact you must come to terms with. If you want a case that accentuates the sleek, diminutive properties of your ipod, this ain't it.BUT, if you want to protect your investment, prolong its lifespan, and confidently carry your music without fear of damage, then the sportsuit is the product you have been looking for.With the cover off you still have significant protection for your ipod and unfettered access to the controls. With the cover on you have additional security as well handy storage for your earbuds, a feature sorely missing from most cases.If you want to emphasize how small and cute your ipod is, buy a Nano. If you want to protect your ipod and have it for a long long time,get a Marware SportSuit."
5,All the details you need,"I've just completed my first deck project, and it would not have been a success without this book. Not excessivly wordy, but to the point on every aspect of construction. Given patience, common sense, the right tools, and this book, you have everything you need to build a great deck. Other books give you some standard methods of construction, which are helpful as a reference, but this allows you to create something more than standard."
2,Can't Evaluate a Book By Its Cover,"This was an excellent book on building decks. However, I gave this a ** rating because I feel the cover photo was misleading. I wanted to build something very much like this photo. There was not one instruction or reference to this design in the book! There was one instruction for a seat and one for a flower box, but neither one was the design on the cover photo. There were several paragraphs about ""covering"" you deck, but they were general ""things to consider"" rather than specifics. Amazon allows a potential buyer to view some pages in a book but not others. I didn't find what I wanted in the ""allowed"" pages before I purchased, but I have noticed that the best information is frequently omitted in the Amazon preview pages. I am certain I can create a very similar design and drawing myself, but I could have done that without buying the book. Why was this cover chosen over an actual photo of one of the designs included in the book?"
5,top 10% of my building books,"An exceptional book with clear and through writing. I found very practical information covering areas I was unsure about. Some of the details, such as reducing wood decay over the long term, designing and building railings, and many little ""tricks"", I have not found elsewhere (and I have quite a few building books). After carefully studying the book I believe I build a deck up to professional standards."
2,"""a couple notches down""","Although i got hooked when i heard the score from the movie's preview i was disappointed when i got the album. For one, there's not much songs! They crammed the few songs in the first part of the film. i don't really care for the out-of-placed"" true to your heart"" - i'm a stevie fan though. of course, there's your usual pop fare served by a belting christina aguilera. i feel that lea's and donny's voice weren't showcased enough. This album is out there in my cd rack eating dust."
5,I think its the greatest soundtrack for disney ever made.,I think the review for this soundtrack because its the best soundtrack. I even like the movie cause is the best walt disney movie made. the movie was based on a Chinesse legend that's was makes a good story.
4,A good song!,"Mulan has a very nice soundtrack. The first time we watched it was when we were in a school camp. The soundtrack is a very lovely song. We like the version of Lea Solonge's ""Reflection."" The song which tells us about man is a very energetic song. We love hearing the sountrack of Mulan. The lyrics of the song is reasonable.="
2,THE SOUND & TEMPO OF THE SONG MULAN,"THE SOUND OF THE MULAN IS NOT SO GOOD.THE TEMPO IS TOO FAST FOR KIDS & ME TO HEAR.BUT,FOR ME THE SONG SHOULD BE A BIT SLOW LIKE A CLASSICAL SONGS.MAYBE THE SONG SHOULD PLAYED BY A GROUP OF ORCHERSTRA OR SYMPHONY BAND.THE CONDUCTOR OF THE BAND OR ORCHERSTRA SHOULD PLAN FIRST AND THEN START THE SONG OF THE MOVIE MULAN.SO I HOPE THE SONG WILL BE IMPROVED ON THE NEXT MOWIE OF MULAN MAYBE.BYE!BYE!"
5,Very entertaining...but historically incorrect,"A great, classic, ""girl power"" movie. But it's interesting to know that in reality, Mulan ended up committing suicide because the emperor wanted her to be one of his concubines."
1,A Poor Disney Effort,This is the worst Disney album in a long time. The songs lack any of the adult complexity that can be found in earlier Disney albums. The songs are cold and the lyrics sound as though they have been written by children rather than talented lyricists.They are songs that could capture your heart but fall short. Jerry Goldsmith's score is too heavy and never seems to lighten up for the subject matter. This album is one for the shelves at the store but not for your shelves at home.
1,Not very good! 1 Good Song on The Whole CD!!!.....,"The entire album stinks! Christina Aguilera's ""Reflection"" is the only song worth listening to! This CD is a waste of money; buying Christina's 1st album for ""Reflection"" would be better than this for that song!"
3,Incomplete - Not what I paid for,"I bought this soundtrack specifically for the ""Short Hair"" segment of the score for Mulan's decision, and I was sorely disappointed when it wasn't on the soundtrack. The only place I can get said track is from a site of questionable legality that's likely riddled with malware. While the rest of the soundtrack is good, I did not get my money's worth as I was cheated out of the score I paid for in the first place."
4,Excellent Soundtrack but . . .,"The sound track is excellent. Lea Solanga is outstanding and the selection of music is great. I found only one possible flaw and that was in the order of the tracks. I think it would been a much better flow if A Girl Worth Fighting For was followed by The Burned Out Village. As it stands now the song ends abruptly. The next track is True to Your Heart. The Burned Out Village should have followed ""Girl . . ."". The two are connected in the film so I think it proper that they be linked on the soundtrack. I think this is a big enough problem that I decided to downgrade my rating. A little more care and thought into the ordering of the selections would have made for a better soundtrack CD."
3,This is NOT the full score of the movie,"This was totally my fault for not checking the description better, but I thought this was the full score of thirty five songs. Not so. It has twelve songs.Sound quality is good, excellent even, but volume is soft in comparison to average soundtracks and other CDs. I had to turn it up 2 notches just to hear it from what is a normal 'easy to hear' volume on my machine, so probably about 4 notches altogether if I wanted to listen to it in an 'easy to hear' range."
5,Love this soundtrack!,"Great songs, great instrumentations, great vocals (Lea Salonga and Donny Osmond, in particular; Christina Aguilera was just plain trashy). Great CD to accompany a great film!"
3,Great music but some songs missing....,"This would be 5 stars except that there are two pivotal pieces of music that aren't on this soundtrack: The introduction music, when the calligraphic art is scrolling across the screen, and ""Mulan's Decision"", when she cuts off her hair, dons her father's armor and rides off into the night on her valiant steed. However, my DJ husband has made wonderful recordings of these two tracks straight from the DVD. That's a great way to get around it!"
4,"Great,, but most of the music pieces are missing!","I love this CD,...And also the ""Mulan's Decision"" one was sort of screwd up at the part when Mulan disguises herself as a boy. I can't really describe it. And also, Blossoms, is a bit out of place because they combine the music where the conscription notices are handed out to Mulan's village and when after Mulan's disguise is penetrated. They shouldn't have put those two together cuz they're in two totally different places in the move! ...the CD is fantastic."
4,Best song ever,"After listening to the disney movie song Mulan ""Honour To Us All"".We felt that the rythmn is like skipping very insteresting,especially when it talks about the acient china woman need to beared children and a man need to battle for their own country.The songs also talk about how the traditional chinese wedding is held.Other than that,we think that the composer had also made in a lot of effort and decision to suit the movie.We think that the melody is active that we would like to listen the song again and again."
3,Not as good as traditonal Disney songs,"Mulan was a great movie but the songs were some what a dissapointment. The music is ok and some of the battle scene music is exciting but this sound track lacks what the others have delivered. With only one real good song, title reflection performed by 98 and Stevie Wonder, I feel this album is not worth buying. Just go out and buy the single when it comes out....."
5,Best disney movie album!!,"This is BY FAR the BEST disney movie soundtrack since...EVER! The Songs are GREAT, the voices singing them are EXCELLENT, and the score is INCREDIBLE! This is even BETTER than Titanic or the Lord of the Rings music! Believe me, if you buy this you will NOT be disappointed!!!Peace out,T-bone!"
3,Even Jerry Goldsmith couldn't save the movie,The movie was horrible. Thank you Disney for another sterylized piece of junk culture. Not Even Jerry Goldsmith could save it. The instrumental music Mr. Goldsmith created is outstanding (he's been creating some of the best music in Hollywood for some time now). The songs however are pitiful. Only a Village People Fan or an 8-year-old could possiblly enjoy them.
5,"Mulan! In my opinion, Disney's best!","I've read the reviews from others about Disney's Mulan and I have to say the songs from this movie were absolutley amazing! The vocals of Donny Osmond and Lea Sangola stirred me down to the core. Osmond's song ""I'll Make a Man Out of You!"" was my absolute favorite. Sangola's ""Reflections"" is a beautiful ballad about Mulan's future and her dreams. The music is very good and I would recommend this soundtrack to anyone who has the time to listen to it, because once you start, you will never turn it off. You'll find your self running around your house with the vaccum singing, ""A girl worth fighting for!"" I seriously give this soundtrack a 10 out of 5 stars!"
2,Keep Mainstream Pop out of the Disney CDS,"Christina Aguilera has the most annoying and obnoxious voice. She makes the song sound tacky. I think they would have had much better taste had they marketed more of Lea Salonga, a true singing professional."
4,Inspiring!,"Well-crafted movie with a good soundtrack. I LOOOOOOOOVVVVVVE the song ""Reflection"" (Lea Salonga's version). The instrumental numbers (esp. ""Mulan Suite"") are also great.No need, indeed, for Christina Aguilera or 98 degrees here. The soundtrack is beautiful on its own and is better off without -- as someone put it -- 'bastardized' pop numbers."
5,It was AWESOME!!!!!!,"Mulan, both the movie and the music, was wonderful. The singers were wonderful. They brought the music to life. My favorite song would be the one Donny Osmond sings. It really brings the movie to life. It was very well written and definetly sung with feeling. I really enjoyed this movie and especially the music."
4,A review of the Mulan soundtrack,"The mulan soundtrack was very good other than when some of the characters are singing. All the real music is excellent, (and if it really matters) good in accordance with the movie."
4,Goldsmith's Score ROCKS - Why Bother With The Songs?,"Give credit to Disney...They not only created a moving and poignant animated film for all ages, but contracted with a composer who could actually do justice to the finished product. Hence, no Alan Menken...no Hans Zimmer...not even Rachel Portman (who was orignally supposed to do the score). Jerry Goldsmith's score portions are easily the best parts of this album; one gets the feeling there's a lot of his music missing from the CD. If that's the case, it's a pity they took up so much album time with those songs. Songs - 3 stars; Score - 5+++ stars."
3,I miss Alan Menken!,"Even in Hercules (in my opinion the least notable work Menken has done for Disney), Alan Menken beats Mulan's music hands down. The songs were too few and too long (with the exception of Reflection, which could have been longer), and they weren't the tuneful work that one has come to expect from Disney. Not that I wanted to hear ""Caucasian"" songs in a movie about China, but I think the songs could have been more memorable without losing the right feel. That said, Goldsmith's score is quite good and worth a listen. Go see the movie - it's incredible - but leave the soundtrack on the shelf. Buy Beauty and the Beast instead.I should comment that the voices are pretty well cast (arguably with the exception of Donny Osmond). Lea Salonga sings beautifully, without reprising her performance as Jasmine, and Mulan's three soldier friends are funny. Wish they had better lyrics to work with (Howard Ashman, I miss you too!)."
5,One of my favorites!!!,"I love this music! The songs ""Reflection"" and ""I'll make a man out of you"" are the best of them!! I actually don't have this soundtrack yet but am saving up for it. (With my current allowance I can't afford much at the moment.) BUY THIS SOUNDTRACK OR FACE MY WRATH!!!:)"
5,Magnificent Mars - magnificent book,This wonderful tome is a journey to the red planet in itself. It answers all the question one might have about Mars and many other questions one wouldn't think to ask. This book has immediately become a treasured possession for which I have much affection. Wonderful for all ages too; children can enjoy the generous and colorful photographs and adults can enjoy the imaginative and beautifully articulated science that explains this distant and mysterious world. Buy this book!
5,MAGNIFICENT MARS..Yes it is!,"I first became aware of Ken Croswell and his work, while attending a meeting of the Sonoma County Astonomical Society in Northern California. My opinion is that Ken is brilliant, and offers us amateur astronomers a glimpse into the details we don't see through our telescopes. This is a terrific work of research and dedication about our small neighboring planet MARS. Personally I found myself wandering over the martian surface through all the beautiful images in the book. Does life exist there?, I certainly hope so. But if it doesn't, maybe we will find the fossil remains one day!This is a large book that may not fit most book shelves. However, it is worth every penny. Enjoy, I did. Now I think I just might go back to MARS!!"
5,my husband will not put it down...again,"I bought this book for my Husband a few months ago. He quickly read it, at times laughing. As usual with my husband, he holds onto books, and redigests them again a few months later. Well, the night before last, he started re reading this book. And he won't put it down again. At times he is laughing, other times he is just impossible to talk to, because he is just so engrossed in the book.He has just asked me to order him another book by the same guy, so I guess he likes this author, and this book."
2,authors should follow their own advice,"This book was very poorly organized. Some chapters are overly long (like Chapter 8) and others should be completely eliminated because they have very little to do with the topic (Chapter 2). The authors are clear enough in their language and use good examples but the scope of the information is too broad. In trying to tie together the micro (psychological) and macro (political) elements of persuasion they bore and confuse readers. Ironically the end result isn't very persuasive. Not a single person in the ""Persuasion"" class I read this for class liked this book- including the professor."
4,Stunning fourth movement,"I am giving this one four stars rather than five because the sound quality is a little disappointing and overall I still prefer the Klemperer recording. That said, the 4th movement in this recording is one of the most moving and spectacular things I've ever heard come out of my speakers. As others have noted, the brass section is especially to be commended. If for no other reason, buy this one for the 4th movement. And get the tissues ready."
1,Oh - Zubin Mehta strikes again,"I wish Amazon would show the honest reviews first (on top). What can be said? Zubin the butcher destroyed this wonderful piece, as expected. I am not sure how he made it but he has absolutely no sense of timing, phrasing, expression. And worst part of all - he has absolutely no clue how to conduct. So the recommendation? STAY AWAY FROM THIS RECORDING!!"
1,bad recording,I received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping. I notified Amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem. I received a credit and Amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out. Thanks Billy Ledet
5,Great pan!!,This pan is great for pancakes and eggs. Haven't tried it for any thing else yet. My father-in-law had the pan at his house and we just loved it. So I looked into buying one for us. Department store price was up to $60 so I was quite delighted when I got it through Amazon for $20. I'm considering buying other circulon pans.
5,Very good for dosas(indian),"Was looking for something that makes good dosas. Read a review on Amazon that this one makes amazing dosas. They are right. It is amazing, non-stick, does not require oil at all...worth the bucks"
4,Works well at a reasonable price,"My husband eats eggs each morning, cooking 'em up in this pan. Heats evenly, excellent nonstick surface. With daily use (and the occasional inadvertent overheating) these pans last about 2.5 years -- best found so far. Would give 5 stars if they lasted longer."
5,Just what I needed!,"Wanted a pan to cook my mother's German Pancakes, and this fits the bill since my former pan had surface damage and food sticking. I learned something from the instructions I had not known: ie, not to use oil sprays on the surface. This griddle fairly heavy (not as much as iron skillet), heats well and evenly. Have since used for other purposes, too. Satisfied."
2,Handle broke after two weeks of use,"Like mentioned in the title, I had this pan for two weeks before the handle broke. All I did was lift the pan, and there wasn't that much weight in it. Amazon did send me a replacement, and I hope this one holds up well. The pan itself works nicely. When it says you don't have to use oil, you really don't have to use oil. It's amazing."
5,Excellent Crepe/Dosa pan!,"This is my 6th pan that i have bought in the last 2 years. The 6th pan not because it was not durable or anything wrong with it but i have gifted 5 other pans. But this was the first time i bought one to use it for myself. This is the best pan ever. My wife uses it to make Indian Dosas (crepes) and they come out crunchy and tasty. Very easy to clean and the quality, taste of the food is incomparable. I also have the 14 piece cookware from circulon and they are equally good. I would surely recommend this to anyone who needs tasty dosa/crepe"
5,Circulon rview,"I was initially skeptical of the pan's unique surface, the slightly raised circular ridges, and its ability to cleanly release food from the surface using a spatula for foods like fried eggs/pancakes, etc. But really, it works just fine. No problems and it cleans up easily. With its heavy duty construction, it looks like it should hold up well. I would recommend this pan to anyone needing a good, flat, non-stick pan of this size and utility."
4,Very solid,Good pan. It's made of thick aluminum so I don't think you can warp it under normal use. Very good nonstick material I make pancakes without any oil. Only draw back is the handle is too heavy and I had to cut it shorter so the pan would lay flat on the stove. This was not a problem for me but for some might be?
4,Great griddle!,Love this griddle; I always had a square griddle and decided on a round griddle for a change because I have a round burner on an electric stove; works great; nothing sticks. Makes great pancakes!
4,Love it!,I use it to make chapatis and crepes and love it. I went through a few griddles before finding the perfect one. It cooks evenly and easy to clean.
5,Buy it,"Awesome pan for Indian cooking. U name the Indian dishes that can be cooked on Pan and this can be used. Chapatis, Dosas, Fish fry's, chicken breast, any thing. No problem at all."
5,Gets the work done!,"So far, I've only used it to make crepes and melted cheese sandwiches. Loving it and not having a problem with scratches or sticking.My least favorite part about cooking is the cleaning that needs to be done afterwards. This griddle practically gets rid of that part for me."
4,Great video for kids,"What I like best about the video is the emphasis on old-fashioned values like practice, teamwork, and sportsmanship. The soccer instruction is solid, and my kids (8 and 6 years old) loved the story line that introduces the video. My kids enjoy practicing the drills they learned from the tape."
1,Not for congestive heart failure patients,If you need low sodium recipes then buy low sodium cookbooks. Since this was a heart healthy cookbook I thought I would be ok with it but not so. Sodium content per serving in most of the recipes is way too high. How can anything with loads of sodium be heart healthy?
2,menomonie,"Just got this book. Dissappointed in the fact it has no pictures of any of the recipes whatsoever and no where was that pointed out before ordering. Also, most of the recipes have an ingredient list an arm long with may ingredients things you will never use again. I have many other heart healthy books which are easier to follow and a lot more beautiful than this one. Sorry I ordered it."
5,The Healthy Heart Cookbook,"I am very pleased with my new cookbook. There are so many recipes and there are pictures of how they should look. I love that it tells the amounts of calories, sodium, fats, etc. that are in each serving.I am very pleased.Also, I am pleased (as always) with the prompt service I receive from Amazon. Whenever I order anything and they send notice of how long it will take to ship and be received; they are always right on!!"
1,DISASTER STRIKES,"I've read the book, and agree that it is terrible. The clear errors show Brejla's clear lack of care for his subject matter. If Matheson is such an important figure in Brejla's life, you would think he would care enough to get the information correct.I also find it interesting that the reviewer ""Meredith from Boulder, CO"" was able to post a reivew, as she is the author's daughter. I wonder if there is any bias in her review? I also wonder why Meredith from Co, Terry Brejla's dauther, wrote such a glowing review AFTER another (real) review trashed the book."
1,Blah blah blah blah,"Boring, makes no sense, and so horribly written.This was a self published piece. Someone tell this guy, he needs an editor.Mispelled words, everywhere.Does mr. Matheson even know what Brejla has done here, i tend to doubt it.From my point, this information is widely known, yet another piece of ""blah"" toadd to his collection of ""the worst material on amazon.com""Dont waste your money...i hear this guy is a quack"
5,Works Perfect,"It is hard to find an accurate description of this regulator, but it does exactly what it should. It is a bypass fuel pressure regulator. Install it anywhere between the pump and the carb/injectors/injector pump and it will send any excess fuel back to the tank. It can be used with gas or diesel.Good Product, bad descriptions."
4,Tradesmans Review,"Makita BGA 18v angle grinderAfter using several brands of cordless grinders its my oppinion that this grinder is ahead of he rest. The main thing with cordless grinders is battery useage. These babies suck the power out of the batteries but the makita seems to last longer. In saying that, over draining the batteries destroys batteries but the makita has a warning light that is in direct line of sight that flashes red when a new battey is required. Definately recommend this grinder."
4,Cordless Makita Grinder,"A fine tool, good weight and well balanced, so convenient to use, rather than stringing out an extension cord for quick needs. One caveat, when applying heavy pressure while grinding, the tool stops and has to be reset. Not a big deal, but a bit aggravating at times."
4,handy when you need it,"This tool has a feature which does not allow you to apply to much pressure on the tool, it will shut down the tool if the red light on the side is on to long, while it is helpful in regards to not overloading the motor, it is pretty sensitive. Still I like the tool, I can have it on my work bench always ready for a small job of cutting something or sharpening when I don't feel like taking out my corded version. The tool is well make and has an easy to use spindle lock. Over all I could recommend this tool."
1,Not recommended,"I own few Makita cordless and very happy with all of them BUT this one.Heavy, not enough power, eating battery really fast, the overload mec. is getting into action and shutting it down really quick with very little load.. I use it for small stuff but still - it simply doesn't do the job. Cheap price - yes, can be handy for light use - Yes, but nothing more than that. I am very disappointed... wish I could return it.."
4,Makita battery angle grinder,Nice product does not have the power of a corded unit but does a nice job when you need it
5,as good as it gets,"makita tools are my favorite,only because i have owned others. this angle grinder works as well for the battery life time as any of my corded grinders,so to be able to use it anywhere,puts it up there!"
3,A little underpowered,Nice for those quick little grinding jobs but easily overloads when pushed. Not a replacement for a real grinder but nice have if you are already an LXT guy.
1,I wish i bought a dewalt set first...,"I bought a four peace from makita 2 years ago. Everything worked for about a year then one-by-one they broke, just quit working or like the BGA452Z (the grinder). I can cut din-rail for an electrical panel and change my new batteries two times. NOW..my dewalt set i have,my buddies have, and the company i work for have WILL OUT PREFORM any tool from makita..I love my dewalts and my cheep makitas are in the trash..I should say i use my tools hard 5-6 days a week. To put a lamp together at home on your time buy makita.For long tool life and hard working by Dewalt and same time and money."
2,Problem grinder,"I have a set of the Makita LI-Ion tools and bought this later to supplement the kit. I got it on sale but still would not buy it again. It takes VERY little pressure to make this tool go into automatic shutoff. I have a Dewalt set also and hands down the Dewalt grinder a better tool. All of the other Makita tools in the set are fine, saw, sawzall, drills, impact all work well."
3,handy,"its handy to have- cuts bolts easily and fits hands well. it kills batteries a little quick, but its not really intended for heavy duty use. if you're into the makita system already, this is a good product. if not, then i'd consider the real expensive milwaukee"
5,18v Makita Cordless grinder,"This tool is a dream come true. I do a lot of repairs where I need a grinder maybe to cut a piece of threshold, metal pipe or anything in between. The BGA452Z is just what is needed for this purpose. I found mine at HD ... so, yeah, didn't buy it here. But the point is, it does deliver, but be aware is not going to be a heavy duty unit, it will cut out under heavy load. Light to medium duty is a safe bet. The batteries do drain quickly but for intermittent work, it will do.Needless to say, it is a Makita tool and it works like one."
5,I Like Makita Tools,Handy and convenient to work with without the incovenience of a power cord. Having batteries from other makita cordless tools the 'Bare Tool' option was great
3,No English subtitles,"The other commenter is correct -- this version is NTSC (compatible with USA televisions) but has NO English subtitles. Very annoying because there is a version in PAL (compatible with British televisions) that DOES have English subtitles. Since someone has done English subtitles, why aren't they on the NTSC version?? There is no reason why the NTSC version cannot have subtitles. The manufacturers of this are losing a pretty big market for no logical reason."
4,Hard to find but no English subtittles!,"I was not paying attention when I ordered this movie, it is in French with no subtitles. I remember watching it as a child on PBS with subtitles. Am very sad I don't speak French but will watch it non the less!"
5,This DVD has English Subs,"Let me clear up all the confusion of the former postings.This DVD has English subtitles, but you will have trouble playing it on a regular DVD player.There is no difficulty playing it on a computer however running Windows (don't know about MACS's...don't have one), and you can connect it to play on your HDTV with an HDMI cable.Simply download VLC media player, open the program, put in the disk and go into the Media File and select open disc. Then select English subs...(Anglais)...and you will enjoy it."
3,Pretty good.,Maybe not THE book on the subject but certainly a worthwhile read. I don't understand the one star reviews.
5,Life After Wabi Sabi,"If I could personaly thank Mr. Richard Powell, for the imence amount of good his work has done for me, I most certainly would. The fluid writing and insightful message of Wabi Sabi Simple has helped me put my life back on track. I can now enjoy life as it passes, each moment is worth more, I no longer worry about small things to the point at which i can no longer enjoy the good. Alot of the examples in this amazing book, such as changing orniments or pictures really does help to let you notice the surroundings in your own home, and you no longer feel as those every day is just like the last. So once again I would like to thank Mr. Powell for the good his book has done me and my family.Yours SincerlySir. Phillip Heyes III"
5,Compatible with DL123A and CR123A,"Since it isn't totally obvious from the product information, I thought I'd mention that this battery is compatible with the DL123A and CR123A batteries."
2,442 Enthusiast,"I found this book a disappointment. While it is unlikely that any book of this kind will be 100% error free, this one has at least one substantial oversight.I have a 1969 442, and I wanted to decipher the data plate on the body. My data plate, however, did not match the one depicted in the book. Ironically, on the back cover is an actual photograph of a '69 data plate, and it to does not match what is shown in the book either. I have a convertible, and the book says I should have a vinyl top. The back cover photograph also shows a particular code for upper body/top color which is isn't even listed in the '69 section. If '69 is this inaccurate, what about the rest of the years?I ended up logging on to (the net), and asking for help which I got the next day.I appreciate the effort in trying to show paint colors and upholstery materials, but I'm not sure this book is worth (it). I'm thinking about returning it."
2,very little info here,i purchased this book thinking it would provide me correct info on my 1967 442 but found out it contained very little usable information . I am trying to do a correct restoration on my car and found only a few pages on my model year with a few black and white photos of no great use . You can use the internet to decipher your cowl tag for free if that is what you are looking to do
5,Great pot!,This pot replaced our old Circulon pot that was almost 20 years old. This pot is definitely a step up from the regular Circulon line. It's much more heavy duty and the lid is really great and tight fitting. The non-stick coating seems very tough and the whole pot is very well made.
2,Lousy lid,"The pot itself is great. It's the perfect size and non-stick. However, the inside lip of the lid is a pain to clean."
5,Get this one instead of the Criterion edition,"I won't dwell on the wonderful qualities of this adaptation of Shaw's most famous theater piece. I won't tell you how superb the actors are. I won't insist that this film is a must for your collection. I'll simply recommend that you purchase this edition rather than paying a premium for the Criterion Collection DVD, which virtually the same disc. There are no extras on either, and spending up to twice as much for a brief essay on an insert is simply not reasonable."
5,Great Old Movie,"This is the classic old film based on G. B. Shaw's play that later was turned into the musical 'My Fair Lady'. This is the non-musical version with beautiful playing by Leslie Howard & Wendy Hiller. The only crabbing done by some people is that the ending is different from the play, but it's still a wonderful film. A must see for film buffs."
5,great movie,"better then My fair lady, the acting is great. Professor Higgens (?) is well portrayed and Miss Dolittlle is acted beautifully."
5,jazz doll,I'm a lover of old movies. I got this movie because I love My Fair Lady. I was not disappointed watching Pygmalion. It was very different in so many ways and very enjoyable. Pygmalion truly had my attention.
3,"Great workout, BUT . . .","I really like Donna Richardson's workouts, but if you're not used to ""dancing,"" this workout is going to be hard to pick up. The 2nd segment (with the kick ball changes) is really off, too. She teaches it one way but then when she combines the routine into one, she does it differently. She even screws up and looks behind her at her other instructors to check her direction! The shot of the camera angle is hard to follow sometimes, too, but once I learned the video that problem disappeared. It's still a good workout, but it took me many, many, tries to get it down -- and I took dance lessons from the time I was 5. I would recommend it if you're up for a challenge. The end toning routine (abs & arms) is awesome."
3,Couldn't get the routines down,"I spent most of my time trying to follow the combination of exercises and most times I did not get them. And the routintes change very fast. Unless you are really quick at picking up routines, this video will most likely frustrate you. The ab workout at the end was pretty decent."
3,Geared more towards the psychotherapist,"I've been contemplating psychotherapy for quite some time and I wanted to educate myself on this subject before I made a decision. The book is reader friendly and gives some interesting information on ""what to do and expect"" for the PSYCHOTHERAPIST, which seems to be the main focus of the author's writing. This became more and more apparent as I read along and I was somewhat bored and frustrated for not getting the information which was truly needed for myself. A good book for the person in this profession but not for the severely depressed consumer."
1,Profoundly basic and uninspired,"I have rarely been disappointed by books that highlight and develop the process of psychotherapy. I found this book to be ridiculously basic. Although it certainly does not harm anyone, this book does not contribute to the available literature or to the professional development of any unfortunate psychologists who add ""Talk is not enough"" to their library. I cannot imagine that this book would be helpful to clients or to therapists at any stage of training."
1,Caveat Emptor,"My first concern about this author's competence came on page four when he stated that he still passionately believes in psychotherapy. This hardly seems appropriate when there are so many concerns as to its effectiveness. I became even more alarmed when on page ten the author confessed that the book was highly anecdotal. I really became alarmed when I couldn't find any references. I became even more concerned when I couldn't find the phrases ""placebo effect"" or ""natural rate of recovery"" in the index. I was almost amused when he describes the therapeutic relationship as something quite extraordinary when I've found my years of therapy to have been of questionable value. Moreover, I found it laughable that the author believes that a therapist can objectively determine biases from self-reported data. It seems more likely that a therapist will project such biases."
3,It's very tricky,"If your car has minimum internal Damage to the rings, this product may help.Pour 1/4 bottle and drive for one mile.In my car the engine slowed down and in idle it shut down because the product it's to thick.So it's trial and error.If it works with 1/4 bottle then it's OK, you can add little more at the time, but do not use the entire bottle at once unless you engine is 5 liter or larger!"
4,describes gender differences in grieving in various cultures,"This is a quick-read book, explaining the differences in grieving between men and women in today's society. It also takes a look at how people grieved in past cultures, as well as cross-culture societies. It explains that today's society hides their true feelings of grief because we are afraid to touch upon this subject."
4,Terrific advice for worried 20-somethings,"Chris Ballard's book is smartly humorous, ironic and self-aare, and a great read for someone looking to find their calling."
3,Interesting but a little too muchdetail on not much for me ...,"The stories in this book are interesting, ten of them, but didnt hold my interest like some books like this. It to me is like an academic self help book. It is interesting in the stories of what some people have found to do, so not a total waste by any means but a little too much on the research side for me. Okay read but not one to keep you up all night."
4,Yummy,"This tea tastes great! I'm not sure if it really does promote urinary tract health, but it couldn't hurt. No caffeine."
4,Delightful,"I recently saw this movie again, and the music was wonderful. It is one of the movie sound tracks where each piece blends in to make you just sit back and listen to it again and again. Thoroughly ENJOYABLE!!"
4,Nicely put together,"I really only bought the soundtrack for the track ""Home Movies"" by Thomas Newman. It's a truly heartwrenching track and it seduced me to buy the entire album for it. The rest of the album is nice, but a little old fashioned for my taste. I'd recommend it to people who like the oldies/blues."
5,Gem from the Treasury of Sufi Mystical Compositions.,"This book is a wonderful read for everyone, whether new to the Writings of the founder of the Baha'i Faith, Baha'u'llah or not.It was written after Baha'u'llah spent 2 years in the wilderness praying and meditating on His mission, like many of the famous messengers from God in the past. This book together with ""The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah"" make up the most mystical and amoung the best loved Baha'i Writings.In ""The Seven Valleys"" Baha'u'llah writes about the seven stages of the lovers journey on his search for his Beloved: God. Each valley represents a plain of understanding such as Wonder, Love, Unity....I would recommend this book to everyone who is particularly seeking closeness to the spirit of God, and those who are beginning their research into the Writings of the Baha'i Faith."
1,Not much Malcolm,"This is typical of the modern style of documentary. Very little of the actual subject matter -Malcolm X, rarely shows up on his own tape. Instead of showing Malcolm himself speaking, they give us OTHER people telling us what a great speaker Malcolm was. Rather than having Malcolm explain himself, we have a variety of ""experts"" explaining Malcolm's beliefs. When you finish watching a tape like this, you can't understand what all the fuss over this guy is about. You don't get a sense of his personality or charisma.Its really annoying how John Henrick Clarke, Joseph X and others are allowed to speak sentence after sentence about Malcolm, but when a clip of Malcolm himself is shown, its often cut after only one sentence.A much better choice is ""Malcolm X: His Own Story as it Really Happened"" which was made back in 1972 when the trend in documentraies was to include as much of the original subject mattera as possible."
5,Engaging and Educational,"The American Experience is an excellent series on PBS. In my opinion, Malcolm X: Make It Plain, is one of the best of the entire series."
3,Not so dramatic,"Krips interpretes this opera too seriously like it is Wagner's. This recording lacks vitality and gaiety and the tempo is too slow.The cast is superb; Cesare Siepi is a virile and sensual Don though his voice is too dark for this baritone role. Ferando Corena is a top Leporello but compared to Giuseppe Tadei, he lacks poignancy and charm. Lisa della Casa is not a perfect Elvira here as she is too gentle and graceful not like a woman who's pursuing a love lost. Hilde Gueden as Zerlina is supreme. Anton Dermota as Don Ottavio is lyrical and moving but he is better in 'Furtwaengler Recording'. But, the decisive miscast is Suzanne Danco as 'Donna Anna'. Her coloratura is not so amusing and too heavy for Anna.Anyways this is not my first choice for Don Giovanni. I recommend Giulini's recording (EMI) which will top forever."
2,A Celebration,"This is not so much a sociological study as it is a celebration--of women, minorities, the working class, the downtrodden, the dispossessed, etc--against the evil white male patriarchy as represented by Yale University. Never mind that Yale is and was then among the most liberal and progressive institutions in our society, and never mind that the clerical and technical workers who brought Yale to its knees were incredibly privileged and well-compensated workers, with undemanding jobs for the most part and extensive benefits in every case. None of that fits into the authors' agenda so you won't be seeing anything of that kind in this book! Instead it's an elaborate jeremiad against our society's ""usual suspects"". Ho hum."
1,Narrow-minded or simple-minded?,"As this CD atests, Rick & Bubba's brand of intolerant and regressive 'humor' perpetuates ugly and unfortunate stereotypes of the South. Their disregard for those who don't share their political or religious views is hurtful and insulting to many, and they're not making any exceptions on 'Pull Our Finger'."
1,Refund,Delivery was refused and product returned to shipper and received by them 12/8/06; however Amazone and credit card company have not coordinated the refund as of this date 1/9/07.
2,Good Writing/Dubious Accuracy,"The book is well-written in a lively, engrossing style, but... Oh, dear... I found several factual errors within the first 22 pages. This was the part of the story I knew and had researched, so knew there were mistakes in fact. When I came to the part I wanted to learn about the previous errors cast doubts over what I was then reading. Even if the rest of the story is flawlessly accurate, I couldn't trust it. Truly a pity as the book is, otherwise, very well done.--since originally writing that, I've done more research on the subject and have gone back to the book... only to find more errors! Some are trivial (but would have been easy enough to get right) and some are significant."
5,"Tito's gonna be dead, and you'll be telling people...",i've been listening to him for years!I must admit that line from Stripes and the authorship credit on Abraxas induced me to buy this.I love it! Everyone should have some Tito... You cannot be still while listening to this.
5,It's a real gem!,"Miss George has written a gem of a book, full of rich, fully realized characters in a setting that is so well described that one can feel the heat rising like a warm, moist blanket. You will be drawn into this world full of secrets and warm family life!"
5,This One and Magic Life,"This book grabbed me by the heart as it revived long-forgotten memories and dreams of family, friends,life and living in the South. This book will join my select group of favorites and I will be telling all my friends about it. Thank you, Anne Carroll George!"
3,"If you have southern roots, you'll smile a lot.","If you understand/appreciate southern culture, you will enjoy this book. Finding your 80-yr old mother dressed for a funeral in a black dress and flip flops - well, what can I say?! This is a light read but fun for those of us who appreciate southern humor."
3,Best if you don't think too much...,"I was a fan of Anne George's 'Southern Sisters' mysteries and was anxious to read this unrelated novel of hers. It was a good story and a good read, but I was a bit disappointed in it, felt that it could have been so much more. The mystery was compelling but oddly resolved.But, all in all, it was a nice read , and I was sad to learn that Miss George passed away and that we will not be enjoying any more books by her."
5,Wish I could make it 6 stars!,"Like many readers, I have read several of the Southern Sisters mysteries, and was not sure what to expect with this novel. Each time I opened the book was like opening a lyrical gift. The story revolves around the life of a just-deceased artist, Artie, her survivors who have come to mourn her passing. The setting of a small Gulf of Mexico town is created perfectly. The characters have great depth. The plot tends to jump a bit in time (and space?), but in the end it lends credence to character development and plot. Interesting choice for title - quite suitable! What a beautiful line on p. 45, ""But Donnie knew what he had seen, and the memory stayed with him all his life like a blessing."" I believe this book will do the same for me."
2,This One and Magic Life,"Unlike the other Anne George novels of the Southern Sisters Mysteries, this book was harder to get into. By the 4th chapter I still could not figure out what was going on! I've put it down for now and will pick it up again later on."
3,I Love Anne George but...,"I love Anne George, but I didn't love this book. It involves murder, incest, and a seriously dysfunctional family. This might be a great read for some people, but I guess I expected it to have the same lighthearted feel of her Southern Sister's Mysteries. So if you're looking for the same thing that I was, I don't recommend this book."
2,Not my favorite,"I've enjoyed reading Anne Carroll George's Southern Sister mystery books and had hoped that this book would be as light and fun to read as they have been. It was syrupy, too sweet for me. I found it similar in style to Anne Rivers Siddons' Peachtree Road, but without the epic plot. This is beach book material."
2,Nice material... horrible stitching,"The material for this was what I expected when compared to other similar products: soft, doesn't bunch up when worn under tighter pants, yet, still machine-washable unlike silk. The problem is the stitching. They protrude out quite a bit and they're abrasive to the skin."
1,wickers - misleading and/or false advertising,"I ordered ""Softsilk"" because I wanted SILK. I payed $18 for a pair of boxers because I thought I was getting a deal on SILK. Not over priced 100% polyester. Polyester is not SILK. Silk is SILK. If I wanted polyester boxers, I'd have gone to any area store and bought them for $5.Now to return them, I have to repackage them, and I assume pay for postage. There is nothing here to let me know how to have my gift card credited either.This is more trouble than it's worth to me, so I'll just be sure to never buy anything from [...]I've seen this kind of thing with lots of companies. It's irresponsible at best and deceptive at worst. It's the responsibility of the company to not mislead their customers. After all, I didn't pay you with sea shells and call it money, did I?"
4,huge fun - highly recommended,"I've just finished this and am amazed by how much I enjoyed it - I'd bought it expecting to hate it but not so. It's very patchy but no more so than Conan Doyle's original stories, and the only really terrible bit is one effort by his son Adrian which is a complete failure, although a very involved thing about Scotland (which left me wondering, why couldn't he have just put the brooch in his pocket? - you'll know what I mean when you've read it) tries the patience rather. Best are the 'Purple Hand' and 'Second Stain' stories, both of which the man himself would have been very proud of, but all are honourable additions to the mythos, hugely enjoyable and very sensitive to the much-loved originals."
4,The Best of the Holmes Pastiche Collections,"Richard Lancelyn Green has examined nearly a century's worth of Holmesian pastiches and collected some of the very best in this book. Stories date from 1920 through the 1980's.Many pastiches try to parody or reinvent the originals, but theses stories affectionately recapture the flavor and tone of the canon."
4,tingly lube,"on behalf of someone who DOESN'T have sensitive skin, this lubricant feels great (minty, nothing new, but great nonetheless). the texture could be a little better, which is why i gave it a 4, but it tastes like peppermint...personally, i love it."
2,tingling=burning for sensitive skin,"I am a woman with sensitive skin. This stuff is probably ok for people without skin alleries and sensitive skin, but it was a nightmare for me. It contains menthol to provide the ""tingle,"" which burned like the Dickens and even washing with soap did not stop the pain. It didn't cause pain on my entire body, just in the vulvar area. It smells really good, is an ok consistency for a silicone lube, and the pump is convenient since it locks closed with a twist. My only complaint is the menthol."
1,Bad bad bad,I first tried Durex lubes -- or any lubes -- when I lived in the UK where they are everywhere because they are the main condom brand... it's available everywhere there and little else is. Then I returned to the States and could try the range of K-Y and other products available here. And that's when I realized how horrible and icky the Durex really is.
3,Not bad,I found this to be kind of mild. People are saying it burns and had to wash it off. Well there must be something wrong with them because I found to be rather weak. I could feel the coolness but that was it. Idid like it but thought it would be stronger of a feeling based on other reviews. I would buy it again.
1,Burning....NOT tingling,"My boyfriend and I used just a dab of this, and after a few seconds a burning sensation kicked in. The bottle says it should be a tingling sensation (which would have been fine), but this was a definite burning sensation instead. It felt as if I'd accidentally rubbed face wash (or maybe hot sauce) in that area. We kept doing our thing for a few minutes, but he found it totally distracting and for me it was counter-productive...I felt as if it was so unpleasant it made me go dry, which is pretty pathetic for a lube in my opinion.My boyfriend enjoys using a shower gel that has menthol in it, so he enjoys the minty tingling feel of the shower gel (including on those parts). This lubricant was nothing like that at all, despite that the active ingredient is also menthol.After we were done he said it felt like a rash. It took a lot of wiping and washing and probably ten minutes before it had calmed down enough for me to fall asleep."
1,DO NOT GET,"My husband and I have tried tons of different types of lubrication and NEVER have we had a reaction like this. We put it on and only about thirty seconds after the application, there was a burning like I've never felt before. I ended up leaping out of bed and running for a cold wash cloth. It took that, and a fifteen minute shower where I washed and washed and washed, before the burning calmed down a bit. Needless to say, it killed any hope of intimacy. If you're looking for something to use as an effective birth control, try this, because you definitely will not feel like having sex afterwards."
1,OUCH!,"My boyfriend and I tried this product. We both felt like we were on fire! It hurt a lot and we had to stop and wipe off a few times in a row to get as much off as we could and then we put a ton of normal lube on to get rid of the burning.If you do try this, use a very little amount!"
3,Doesn't tingle.,"Doesn't really tingle. Just sort of, makes everything warmer, but in an uncomfortable way. And it seems to not last very long either. Had to be reapplied several times for some sort of effect."
4,Favorite Travel Books,"These books are small and compact and give you the very brief outlines of the Top 10 things you need to know about all sorts of things - Parks, Family Activities, Shopping, Restaurants. If you are looking for a lot to read and indepth this is not it - but perfect for quick and easy!"
1,Too basic,"I was being cheap when I bought this book and it definitely shows. The book is very basic and just talks about that it feels good to stay dry and mommy,daddy,grandma,grandpa will be proud when the kid uses the potty. The free stuff I got from the diaper companies for PullUps and EasyUps was much more effective for my son."
2,Nothing new or different than other books we have,If it's your first potty training book then maybe it's OK. We have a few books and this one is no different than those.
5,BRILLIANT Album,"This will be, without a doubt, the best album you will ever have bought. Every song is unique and incredible, this is one you won't want to pass on."
3,A bit misleading..,"Of course, that's most likely my fault. I heard ""Le Disko"" for a commercial and hopped on the computer, found the band, and immediately thought ""every song must be like that..."" or at the very least, it had the same beautiful female vocal for every song.Wrong. I should've previewed each song and then I most likely would've just bought ""Le Disko"" the mp3 by itself instead of the CD. I found going through the CD first time around without 'prep' it feels like this severely emo guy who must've gotten kicked off Good Charlotte or something takes over each song - most songs are very melancholy, or sound it anyway. When the female vocal takes over, the songs have more of that riot grrl kick that I thought the CD would've had.Oh well. Still a good band I guess... but still, I'd suggest going over the song previews before buyin'."
4,(4.5 stars) Most satisfying CD I've purchased in a while,"Excellent synth rock. Luckily, I didn't hear the vapid Le Disko first, otherwise I would have ignored this band. Rainy Monday, You Are The One and Don't Cry Out caught my attention and more complicated songs like Starts With One and Chemistry of a Car Crash have maintained my interest. Buy the CD as mp3 files, ignore Le Disko and you'll have a great collection of songs."
2,LeDisko great rest not so much,All I can say is that I really hope whichever subset of the band is responsible for Le Disko dumps the rest of the band and soon.Edit: Check out Versant. :)
2,more of the same,"If you like indie synth-pop, this album sounds like a million other songs you heard before; but with better production. I mean that in the worst possible way. It really sounds like some trance artist produced a mix of various other synth-pop artists. I was not impressed."
5,"Great band, awesome CD, future stars.","I heard a couple of STG songs on the radio here in Boston and liked them. So I picked up the album, amazing. It has been a LONG time that I found an album that I could listen to from begining to end. I don't love every song but I find each song brings something different. Favorites are: Le Disko, Rainy Monday & Chemistry of a Car Crash. Also pickup their ""Stripped"" LP to hear some very cool remakes os ""Stripped"" & ""Nothing Compares to You."" Looking forward to ""Season of Poison"" coming out in November."
2,Pretty mediocre,"Just a day prior to listening to this CD for the first time, I listened to a CD from another new band I'd never heard of before, Persephone's Bees. Where I really enjoyed that disc (P's B's) and thought I'd discovered something, with STG I was very bored throughout the whole CD. They SOUND good, but there isn't one song on We Are Pilots that I would consider even close to being memorable. When the CD packaging is the best thing about a music release - and they have a very good CD package for We Are Pilots - that's a real bad situation."
4,magnificant debut,"This album is a m a z i n g. You've probally heard their song "" Le Disko"" on the radio and while that song is good it is no where near the best song on the cd.Their cd has a dark feel, almost like your driving around in the rain. Their lyrics are well written and their sound is very experimental and fresh.Great tracks: waiting, rainy mondays, chemistry of a car crash, and we are pilots.You may not get into the record at first, because the rest of cd doesn't sound much like their hit single, but give it a try- you'll loooove them=]"
3,A slow start to one of the best series ever,"Those readers who gave up after the first book gave up too quickly -- or were looking for the wrong kind of book. ""A Mirror of Her Dreams"" has very little in common with the depth, darkness and intense character exploration present in The Gap series. I admit, it starts off slowly, and there is a lot of misogyny in the novel -- rape, mental abuse, physical torture. But the brilliance of the writing is in revealing multiple sides to one personality as the series continues, weaving through plotlines to a fascinating conclusion. The reviewer who said that Donaldson was degrading women clearly never continued through the books where her strength, and that of several other women, is the kingpin upon which the machinations of the series hang. The Real Story serves to set up the rest of the books -- read it, but don't give up here -- the reward will come, better and better with each book."
5,Great story,"Simply one of the best, if not the best science fiction I have ever read. Stephen R. Donaldson is an excellent writer, but his entire Gap series is great. The first book has some brutal, sick moments, but it all comes together, and I think is necessary for the story to be what it is. The characters start off kind of shallow, especially in the first book. But, it's basically an overview, an introduction, backround. They quickly become more complex, and with Stephen R. Donaldson's writing style, ( In the Thomas Covenant books, he was a little over describing and melodramatic), it becomes his characters and thier trials. It just works. Also, he backs his futuristic technology, with what I consider very realistic, scientific explanations. I'm no physicist, but it sounds about right to me.Also, his characters to me, seemed very realistic. I just really liked these books."
3,Depressing but necessary beginning to an excellent series,"Donaldson sets the stage for the 'Gap Into Conflict' with this tiny novel, but it can also be read as a stand-alone. As a stand-alone it's depressing, as others have indicated, but as a series intro its darkness makes every victory of perseverence over evil in the later novels that more pronounced. A necessary if morose beginning to an overall excellent series."
5,"Not for ""fluff fantasy"" lovers","Donaldson continues his own unique brand of storytelling. Themes of suffering and redemption can be found throughout his works. While parts of ""The Real Story"" are stomach-churning in their detail and content, you are forced to keep reading just to convince yourself that all of the sacrifices are for something. Just what that ultimate redemption is will have to wait until the end of the series! But all of ""The Gap into..."" novels are riveting and emotionally-absorbing. The characters are simply mythic in that they are larger than life but filled with human flaws. Donaldson has never written a book that was trivial and this series continues that tradition. If you want heroes that always triumph and happy endings that gloss over reality, then go read something else."
4,Space Opera Returns,"Often the term ""space opera"" is taken as a derogatory comment about a particular piece of science fiction. That is not the case with Gap into Conflict. It is a space opera in the best possible sense, filled with adventure, larger than life heroes and non-stop action.Unlike Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, ""Gap"" is a story in the tradition of the early writers of science fiction. Set in a future where wealth is the only power, the conflict between good and evil has gone beyond Earth into the asteroid fields beyond the gap. The bad guys are really, really bad and even the ""good guys"" have their Achilles heal.If you're looking for an entertaining read this is it."
5,The first book in a soon to be classic series,"Donaldson does it again with the first book of ""The Gap"" series. His descriptions of Angus are both revolting and compelling. I have yet to read a more disgusting character than Angus Thermopyle. Totally void of any redeeming qualities, Donaldson has created the ultimate anti-hero. This book sets up most character development for the other novels that follow. Not as in depth as the first books from the ""Thomas Covenant"" series, but on par to be a 'must read' for any Donaldson fan. This series is not to be missed!"
2,This is Donaldson?! Are you sure?!,"I read this book after finishing Donaldson's series of Covenant books (all six, which took me an entire year), hoping for more of his genius in a different setting. All I can say is, if this book is anything like Donaldson's other science fiction books, he's much better at fantasy. The protagonist is Angus Thermopyle, a space pirate, a drunk, and an all around jerk. At first, I figured he would be the unlikely hero, that something would happen to change my opinion about the character. It didn't. If there were rednecks in outer space, Thermopyle is them. Maybe Donaldson's other scifi books are better, but I can't give this one more than 2 stars, which is probably more than it deserves."
4,"short, violent and juicy","Ah, a kind of book which perks my interest - short, violent and juicy.The story writing is original, taking the reader from the simplistic setting of a story on through all the details (nitty-gritty at times) and takes the reader to the same conclusion as was in the short, simplistic version.The characters are very distasteful , drawing me into the story. I like to have characters with flaws, big gapping flaws which are probed painfully again and again. Perfect, happy characters bite. The Real Story, while short, won't let a reader down if you're interested in the above."
3,"Overall good book, but it's SO BLEAK.","This book is somewhat like my life, bleak, and more bleak. It's good entertainment and interesting stuff, a good book, but oh so depressing. Read it anyway, cause it gets better in the sequels, and you won't understand the sequels unless you read this."
4,"I wanted to like, but I hated it, but I really like it.","I can't help hating the Characters. There isn't a single good person in the whole series. I'm not casting the first stone, I'm throwing a boulder. They make me so mad! Some parts are throughly drawn out. But if you read the ENTIRE series you will love it, it took me till the 3rd Book. In fact it's not a series, its a good book bound in 5 Issues. The tension just keeps building and building."
3,It's a ripoff until you read the Afterword,"When I finished The Real Story, I was disappointed. The extraordinary prose Donaldson exhibited in the Thomas Covenant series was missing. A short story had been expanded into a $7.00 book.But I had a bit of time on my hands, and decided to read the Afterword.Now I understand, and have just begun the second book in this series. I hope it lives up to the promise Donaldson made in The Real Story."
1,No Good,"There's a vein of rabid misogyny that runs through most of Donaldson's books. In some stories, such as the Mirror of her Dreams books, it's possible to overlook it. That is not the case in The Real Story. This book is basically a 300 page rape scene. I really can't recommend it."
2,Embarrassed to admit I read this,"I'm embarrassed to admit I read this. So why am I confessing? Maybe it's good therapy. Unbelievable characters. Trite dialog. Flat out stupid plot. And the worst thing is, the 4 book ""series"" that this begins isn't so much a series of 4 books, but 1 big lame book split into 4 installments. A real series would have distinct stories, a beginning and an end, with some sense of completion to each. This reads like a TV mini-series complete with a cliffhanger at the end of each night's episode.So, if I hated it so much, why 2 stars instead of 1? Somehow the author managed to trick me into reading every book. I got to the end of the first and thought ""oh that was awful, I have to read the next one.""Take my advice and avoid this like crack: it's easier never to start than to try to stop."
1,Deep Philosophical Point ...Not Made...sorry...weak,I did not find the story interesting at all. The book was recommended to me by a friend whose recommendations I will not take anymore.
3,Too contrived,"I was surprised at all the rave reviews of this book. I'm a huge fan of Donaldson, not only from his Tomas Covenant books, but from his much lighter ""Mordant's Need"" books.His first go at science fiction was a sight to behold, an ugly and disgusting world where everything makes you wretch and everyone is your enemy. All of the characters have huge flaws and proceed along paths that I can't imagine any sane person taking. I hated everyone in the book, and felt sorry for them at the same time. I couldn't read any more. If that's what Donaldson was attempting, I applaud him, but I won't read any more of these books."
4,"Uncomfortable, but worth getting through it",I had a hard time reading this. Stopped and started reading this several times. The brutality against the woman is difficult. Then you get past that and the story gets going. Then it's enjoyable to read and sets up for the next book.
2,I gave up...,This is pretty cheesy and salacious. Not worth spending the time. I gave up after a half-dozen chapters. Its not so much a science fiction novel as it is about exploitation of females. Don't waste your time.
1,I won't be reading the sequel,"I really wanted to like this book. I had just finished the ""Mirror of Her Dreams"" books, and loved them. But this one was almost painful to read. Donaldson's writing plunged into hack, striving for cleverness but failing. The plot was admittedly intriguing, but I had a strong sense of deja vu; where had I read this before? The characters seemed more plot devices, ""concepts,"" than real flesh-and-blood creatures: interesting, but never engaging. Finally, Donaldson continued his very disturbing and persistent (and, to me, pointless) trend of sexually threatening and abusing his ""heroines."" This book quenched my desire to read more into the Gap series, not to mention more Donaldson, as there are many other sci-fi books (and authors) with good story lines, but better writing and fewer offenses. If you have an incurable fascination with this author, you may like ""The Real Story;"" otherwise, there's not much to recommend."
2,Fantastic Series following a Real BAD Story!,"The first time that I read 'The Real Story' was the last time Iwould ever read it. It disgusted me so much that I almost neverpicked up the second book in the 'Gap Series'. What a greatmistake that would have been. Anyone who loves the'ThomasCovenant' series will love this epic as well.I am presently reading the series now for a third time. I juststart with book # 2 'Forbidden Knowledge'. The four othernovels in this series are 'CLASSIC' Donaldson! For theNOT faint of heart, I would advise a single reading of thisbook. It sets the story line so that you can effectivelyfollow the remainder of the story. It is possible toenjoy this series without ever reading this one book.Just don't miss the last four books! Youwill miss reading a Donaldson epic that will make you late forwork because you couldn't put it down."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"One policewoman, two pirates.A space policewoman, with a serious flaw - she gets sick during the type of travel required to cross interstellar distances - gets into trouble when the destroyer she serves on runs into a ruthless pirate.Enter another, more dashing, far less ugly pirate into a bleak story of capture and survival, along with the beginnings of a nasty alien plot."
2,Does this book stand alone,"I read this book, and ONLY this book out of this series. It was sub-par, so I didn't buy the rest. This book ends like a movie serial. I loved The Unbeliever series, and expected more from The Real Story.I sit here and read reviews of all the Gap books, but the reality is that this one is badly written. Perhaps the series is good, but I will never know because I disliked the writing style, the simplistic story, and the pulp ending of the first installment. If an author writes a bad novel, do they REALLY deserve to get more of your money? In this case, I didn't invest another [dollar] in the rest of the Gap books because the first was not very good. I recommend you do the same.... The Gap gets 2."
1,the one and one half books really stank!,"I can't for the life of me think the author of ""The Thomas Covenant Chronicles,"" and ""The Mirror of Her Dreams"" for which I've read seven plus times each is the same slug who wrote the forementioned books. What a waste of talent!"
1,Depressing,"This book was relentlessly disturbing, depraved and ultimately depressing. I'm not sure why I bothered finishing it."
1,I'll never read Donaldson again...,"I kept reading trying to get to the real story but kept winding up in the degradation of a woman and her treatment by ALL the characters as an object to further their own egos. I think Donaldson also uses Morn as an object, a way to cause conflict and to help show how degradation and humiliation affects the abuser and the viewer. The Covenant series didn't do much for women, the Mirror books claimed a female hero but repeatedly set her up for deliverance by either a man or an unexplainable event--she can't help herself or fulfill her destiny without help.The books made my stomach hurt. It was unacceptable and unredeeming violence against a person without serious reprecussion.I requested that these books be removed from the Juvenile Fiction section of our public library. That is a first for me."
1,Bad. Gratuitous violence done badly.,"It's really hard to care for these books. I'm currently trying to read the second of the series (I was hoping it would get better) and it's a struggle. It's far too easy to be distracted by something more interesting... like watching paint dry.If you like edgy, violent sci-fi, try Richard Morgan's Black Man (aka Thirteen). Lots of action and with some interesting social commentary.If you want a good space opera romp, try Alastair Reynolds, Iain M Banks or Peter F Hamilton.If you want to waste a few hours you'll never get back, read this."
1,Boring Book and a Half,"I read the first Thomas Covenant books and thought they were ok. So, I thought I'd give these a try. I gave up midway through the second book. Just didn't have enough action. According to some of the reviews, the action was just about to begin. Is that true? Did I give up too soon?"
1,Doesn't work,"I Purchased this product because they claim it will fix a slow leak in a co2 gun. It does not. Still leaks. May be good for lubrication, but will not fix leaks."
5,Oil for pellet gun,This oil is of the highest quality and a little goes a long ways. It is small and compact and can be stored anywhere.
5,Great stuff,I use this stuff to seal the CO2 cartridge on my Airsoft CO2 pistol and it really does the job. Before I started using it if I let the gun sit for a couple of days the CO2 would leak out. Now by putting a drop on the tip of every cartridge when I insert it I can leave the gun sit for weeks and it doesn't leak at all. This is surely a great product and worth every penny.
1,Crosman Pellgunoil,"I purchased this oil for a Gamo break barrel rifle. When it arrived there in bold letters was this note ""Not for use with break barrel air rifles"". Makes me wonder why this isn't noted in the product description.The instructions that came with the rifle were minimal at best."
2,Far Too Expensive,"I paid far too much for this item (pellgun oil). I found it at Walmart and academy Sports and Outdoors for $2.98. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Don't be fooled learn from my experience. At 5.98 for 1/4 ounce that would equate to nearly 24.00 an ounce. Get the point!"
5,Great oil for air guns,I purchased this item to go along with a Crosman air pistol for a Christmas present for a grandson. We have found that it performs well when used as the pellet gun manufacturer recommends. It helps the power and operation of the air pistol. I would recommend this to family and friends.
2,"WARNING: ""Not for break barrel rifles""","As others have said, but I did not notice, this is not for break barrel pellet rifles. I wish I had seen that in the product description!"
3,Oil,"Oil is oil,,,,what can I say,,,,,,,,,,,, the oil works like it was suppost too do,,,,oil is oil,,,,,,,,,no more than that,,,,,,,,,T..Y.."
5,Came quickly and makes my gun easier to pump,"I have a benjamin 392 and it is simple to maintain this rifle with my pellgunoil. Just put a drop or two of oil on the joints illustrated to you in the manual that came with the rifle, and you are all set. The manual instructs to oil every 250 shots or when it feels dry."
5,Keep you pellet gun alive,"This is easy to use. Put a drop on top of your CO2 cartridge before you put it into the gun. Do this every time. Your air rifle will last a lot longer if you do. A tube will likely last longer than you will, so it's a good value. Happy shooting!"
4,"expensive, but recommended by experts over plain oils","I considered using non-detergent 30 weight oil that some people use, but at a drop at a time, this tube will last a long time and it's easy and clean to dispense. No concern that it will mess up your gun either!"
2,Oops,"As previous review states, ""this is not for spring air rifles"". Well, i didn't read that before i bought this oil. I found out online that any oil placed in a spring air rifle can (and will) explode inside the chamber, similar to the combustion inside a diesel engine. Please add not for spring air rifles in the description Amazon."
3,Yes and No,"This oil does exactly what it is supposed to, it keeps the CO2 from leaking when putting in a new CO2 tank on my BB pistol and holds the air in when sitting for longer periods of time. As for the product itself the tube leaks all over the place. Used to keep in my dresser but found out there was sticky red fluid all over everything. IF YOU NEED THIS PRODUCT KEEP IN A PLASTIC BAG WHEN NOT IN USE!"
4,On Pellgunoil,It is a useful product to keep your CO2 airgun in a good condition. It prevents leaks and broken seals. One drop on the tip of the CO2 canister helps to lubricate the valve and to prevent damage on the airgun's seals. It helps to extend gun's life.
4,good delivery,This is a good quality oil for an air gun breech which is very important in a product of this nature.
4,Good but comparable to sewing machine oil.,"I got this for my 357 Magnum by Crosman. I was recommended sewing machine oil by a friend which does the same thing but decided against it in order to keep my warranty valid. It works well but I dislike having to search for a needle to open the thing when I first got it, and then the dropper wasn't very accurate. Its like how they sell popcorn at theaters, same stuff in stores (sewing machine oil) but they make it fancy and raise the price. Good marketing and profit strategy, Crosman!"
2,sophomoric or soporific? both!,"The deluge of both five- and one-star reviews precludes any sober assessment of this novel.Kudos to the author for his moxie and his admission of sabotaging the amazon reviews. Unlike many commentators, I have read the book. I discovered a flimsy structure, cringingly-poor dialogue, and an adolescent-level understanding of intertext, its importance, its subtlety. As it was a first novel, he will no doubt seek to improve (though not for pedantic boors like myself)"
2,Thinly-disguised autobiography including adolescent fantasy,"Although Warp's plot is a little thin, Lev's references to pop culture are amusing. He covered the Gen X waterfront pretty well. I would have liked to see him stretch himself a bit, though, perhaps with a reference to Nigel Molesworth instead of Terri Garr. And Lev, there are no women like Xanthe, OK?"
1,"Laughable, but not funny","""Warp"" features none of the wry intelligence and humor on display in Grossman's Salon essay. Thie first draft of a novel is an aimless, shallow tale told without insight or humor. The characters are unmemorable, the plot is nonexistant, and the dialogue is painfully cliched. I am truly disappointed that I wasted an afternoon reading this drivel."
2,Not a great book.,"I found ""Warp"" to be unreadably trite. The main character is extremely self-absorbed and the narration suffers from the author's arch media references. The novel has no plot, its characterization is weak, and its general tone is facile and somewhat sophomoric. I do not strongly recommend this book."
1,Nothing to write home about,"Read this book in thirty minutes standing up in a bookstore. Didn't seem to demand closer reading than that. Fair to middling, as they used to say."
5,Better than I Expected,"I was prepared for this to be another machismo leaking sci-fi thing like all the other books i borrow from my boyfriend, but this was actually good! I read it in one sitting and got all wrapped up in and even came back to order a copy for a friend who's birthday is coming up. It's not boring at all!"
5,Great Book for Excel Users,"This book is exactly what it describes itself to be: the User Manual which *should* have been included with the software. I originally found this title at my local library, and decided to buy my own copy within a week after having checked it out."
2,Lacking,"This book simply lacks behind most standard textbooks (Weingreen, Lambdin, Ross, LaSor,...) in terms of depth. Verbs are covered rather sparsely (one or two brief chapters), summary tables of verb patterns leave much to be desired and there is hardly any coverage of syntax and style. This was the first BH book (actually both the first and second volumes) I ever bought many years ago and I've hardly used them. I've tried to use them for self-study before I took up BH in college, but did not make much progress."
4,Well done!,"Steve Allen got together some very fine musicians for this date, and the excellent results show. Ken Peplowski (cl/ts), Glenn Zottola (tp), and Howard Alden (g) all contribute fine work on this CD. The rendition of Allen's ""Everyone can see how much I love you"" is the highlight here--a beautiful ballad done just right. A most enjoyable CD."
5,Steve Allen Plays Jazz Tonight,This is what a tight Jazz Ensemble is suppose to sound likeVery Good!

1,Don't bother with this product,I tried this product on two vehicles. It did not work on either of them. One leak was tiny at the rear main seal and the other was much worse and coming from multiple areas. Don't waste your money!
2,I thought it would be better...,"I'm not sure if it was the author's writing style or the book itself, but I found this book hard to follow. The author's writing style was choppy and her sentences just didn't seem to flow. I was constantly reading and re-reading; it was as if my brain was stuttering. I also thought complete chapters could be skipped because they were both not pertinent and boring. The book would still make total sense without them. I generally enjoy books of this nature, but this one just didn't do it for me."
2,"Apparently, you must be a caregiver to find this entertaining","Let me start off by saying that I have never had the experience of being a caregiver to someone with Alzheimer's. It seems this book has touched chords for many of those who have done so, God bless them. For me, having no experience with the disease, it was simply a cronicle of a selfish woman's journey through the most selfless of life's tasks. I didn't like Jeanne and I didn't feel sorry for her.She was selfish, bitter and uncaring - and that was before her mother developed Alzheimer's. She carried grudges and misguided opinions long after they were relevant in her life. I appreciated the honesty and certainly the glimpses into the harsh realities of life as a caregiver. However, I cannot recommend this book to anyone UNLESS they are dying to read the hopeless story of a woman who has given up on ever having any sort of a life. She doesn't try to have one. She never did."
2,"Most Mediocre Book I've Read This Year, So Far","Although it started off promisingly, the story didn't hold my interest, and the characters were unlikable. And the ending...? Irritatingly unsatisfying. I lovingly shelve most every book I read, a small tribute to the author and the hours of pleasure she/he has given me. But this one...? It has been deservedly tossed on a small stack of books to take to the used book store. Unknown, unpublished authors everywhere should take encouragement from this novel's publication: ""If M. A. Harper got 'Worst Day' published, there's hope for me!"""
1,Terrible!,"This is, without a doubt, one of the worst books I've read in recent memory. It reads like a painfully long book report on Buster Keaton written by a junior high school student: short, awkward, repetitive sentences chock full of misspellings, grammatical errors, overused superlatives, and excessive generalizations. As if that weren't enough to dissaude anyone from trying to read his work, the author included a plethora of factual errors as well. I'm ashamed our public library actually carries a book this bad, but at least I didn't waste any money on it."
1,Unbelievably HORRIBLE,"One question kept running through my mind as I read this book (or, rather, read the first half before I threw the thing out)....Did this author do any actual research for his information??? I noticed many glaring contradictions or falsehoods troughout the book, but chalked these up to the possibility of differing reports from interviewees. But, as soon as I read that DANNY KAYE starred in The Buster Keaton Story (actually starred Donald O'Connor), I promptly recycled the book and went in search of something (ANYTHING) better that may have been written about the greatest film comic of ANY time. Mr. Edwards, please stick to criticizing film....don't actually WRITE about it!"
3,Other reviewer is talking about the wrong book,"Dover Publications has an enormous selection of reproductions of books, many of the Lindberg Press, in its Charted Designs series. The other reviewer is talking about one of these books:Quick-And-Easy Christmas Charted Designs (Dover Needlework)Old-Fashioned Christmas Charted Designs (Dover Needlework)Charted Christmas Designs for Cross Stitch and Other Needlecrafts (Needlepoint)Christmas Needlepoint Designs Charted for Easy UseWhile they are perfectly fine books, because there are so many different titles, you're not well-served to hear about the wrong title. Anyway, this does have some nice designs although I have not made any. You may be inspired to pick up your needle and personalize your kitchen so check this out. They're good bargains."
4,Works well but made for Poulan Pro Tractors,"I ordered this for my Husqvarna 48"" Lawn Tractor, but this product is actually made by Poulan. Everything fit on the my tractor except the mounting bracket. I had to drill some holes in the bracket as well as heat and bend the fasteners that are made for the Poulan tractor to make it fit. However, once I got this on, the bagger itself works great."
3,Spirited in spite of spotty sloppiness,"Peter Maag's conducting is nothing but exciting, but sometimes he demands more of the orchestra than can humanly be possible. Yet, while there are moment when intonation or attack might make you wince a bit, there is such life in this recording that I would still recommend it as a prized archive. The Scottish Symphony is probably Mendelssohn's greatest, and Maag's interpretation of it revives its rough, rocky, rainy side - it is so full of spirit that you'd swear the faeries are still alive in that foggy northern country. The same can be said of Maag's conducting in Midsummer Night's Dream - so vivid that it takes you into Shakespeare's land, but so ambitious that the orchestra and especially the chorus can't quite make it.... Yet the enthusiasm of it all is inspiring and this is by far not a poor recording. Actually, its spirit should be an inspiration to all, music lovers and music professionals alike, in spite of its few flaws."
3,Breath Taking,"I read this book in two days. My names Amanda and I'm 15. This book is breath taking. It has suspense, adventure and romance. It starts out with a girl named Ivy Breedlove who feels left out of her famliy because she doesn't won't to be a lawyer like everyone else. She starts in on doing her history of the Breedloves and intervues everyone in the family except one person whom she is unable to find. Soon she traks her down and has to climb a mountain to get to her. While hiking up the mountain she runs into a guy named Jack and falls in love with him. After meeting her aunt she discovers her missing link and is faced with death. I suggest that you buy this book today, it's really good."
2,Not Great At All,"Usually I'm a fan of Joan Bauer books. But this one I couldn't even force myself to finish. It wasn't the story itself--at least, I don't think. The grammar was absolutely horrendous. I don't know if this book skipped the editor and they had a fourth grader type it, but there were mistakes on every page. I found it so frustrating I only made it halfway through.If you can stand the grammatical errors, you may enjoy this book--Joan Bauer has proven herself to be a good writer in the past. But the difficulty reading this book overpowers the story that may be there."
3,Backwater,"Backwater, by Joan Bauer was a good book. This book was about a young teenager, Ivy Breedlove, who was trying to find out about her family history. She wanted to be different from her family of lawyers, and when her family found out, they said she was like her Aunt Joesphine. Joesphine is a character who didnt care about what anyone thought of her, she also did not want to become a lawyer, and she ended up living in the mountains all alone, in her cabin with the birds."
4,Good Book!,"Thsi book is awesome! Stuck in a family that have been lawyers for generations, Ivy Breeedlove feels out of place. How couldn't she? For insted of wanting to be a lawyer, Ivy has a passion for history and wants more then anything to become a historian. When her Great Aunt asks her to complete the family history, Ivy jumps for her chance at finally starting to become a historian. Soon Ivy realizes that there is an aunt that no one talks about, another person who broke the mold of lawyers. An aunt who's missing a few screws and is stuck in the ""backwater."" It is then that Ivy, determined to find her aunt, sets out for a journey through the mountains and finds her aunt, as well as wolves, love, birds, and the danger that the mountain can bring. Read this book and become sucked in with the vivid descriptions and great dialouge."
4,More of an adventure!,"Bauer normally writes stories for the sake of telling a story, but this book had a character driven by her own will not of the events pushing her to take action."
3,"Okay, but not up to Bauer's usual standards","Not awful, but this book isn't up to Bauer's usual standards. The plot felt rushed, and in places it was very didactic... and obvious. Some funny commentary from the heroine, though. Read SQUASHED or RULES OF THE ROAD instead."
3,A Mediocre Anthology,"This collection of previously published articles is at times very funny, insightful, and a good primer on several financial issues that dominated the 1980's, but it can also be repetitive (many of the articles repeat jokes, anecdotes, and some even seem to be slightly altered version of previous articles)and is quite dated since the articles detail financial events and characters of the mid to late 1980's. I learned a fair amount about the savings and loan scandals, leveraged buy outs, and the Japanese economic miracle and collapse, and also enjoyed some amusing tales of financial excess, but I had to read through a lot of less than interesting pages to find those treasures. I would not recommend someone buy this book, but if you can find it in the library, it is certainly worth flipping through it."
2,The Money Culture is US?,"This is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness Lewis' early literary attempts. Although Lewis is a witty, scrutinizing, insightful, and overall entertaining writer, I think this book is highly overpriced. Most of the topics in this book cover financial/business culture issues that date back during the late eighties, so there's also a bit of historical perspective to it, when LBOs were a la mode, Donald Trump was making headlines, and Japan was considered a threat to the US economy and welfare...crazy thought. Go for Liar's Poker if you want to read Michael Lewis, that script is a jewel."
1,don't let liar's poker fool you,"I thoroughly enjoyed Liar's Poker. Having finished that, I picked up The Money Culture since I thought Michael Lewis did such a wonderful job with the previous book. Was I ever wrong. Buried deep within the holier-than-thou attitude was that slight trace of sarcasm that made Liar's Poker so great. Why did I ever pay for a collection of pure random thoughts? For a no-holds-barred look at the world of finance, I recommend Money Business and F.I.A.S.C.O."
3,Mostly only historic value.,"Articles published in different newspapers and magazines in the years 1980-1990 about major and lesser financial adventures.The best ones for me, were 'Eddie the Chop House Boy' - about a stock salesman who continues to take everybody for a ride at different broker houses and 'Taken for a ride on the Customer's yacht' about Louis Rukeyzer as emperor without clothes.Most articles have only historic value: the S & L scandal, Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken, the RJR Nabisco battle, the cornering of the bond market by Salomon brothers, the LBO mania (leveraged Rip-Off) and the end of the Japanese bull market (kamikaze capitalism).All articles written in an ironical or sarcastic style."
5,Good Holiday reading,This is an easygoing book to read while on holiday. You can pick up and put this book down at your own pace. Each chapter is unrelated.
4,One-Third of Book Worth Reading,"""The Money Culture"" are a compilation of magazine articles written in the period of Michael Lewis' life just after he had achieved status and fame with ""Liar's Poker"" and before he achieved everlasting status and fame with ""Moneyball."" Some of the articles are very fun to read, but they were written at a time before Lewis developed an attention span and so they do feel abrupt at times. The first part of the book about Wall Street does feel very relevant, and it's unnerving the similarities between today and the late eighties Wall Street -- it's as though no one took notice of the doomsday warnings about Wall Street back in the late eighties, and we're just digging a bigger hole for future generations. The last part of the book about Japan is boring and irrelevant, and not at all worth the effort.Michael Lewis has a fresh and irreverent sense of humor, and this book is still worth picking up."
2,Item does not match photo/description,"I should have read the other reviews more closely to realize that the boot slipper pictured and described is NOT what is being shipped in 2012. As mentioned by others, the product being shipped is Dearfoams Women's DF451 Bootie which has a large faux fur cuff around the ankle. It does not unfold up and is an ivory color - sure to show dirt and wear over time.I will not review the slippers actualy received - I'm not sure if I will keep or return them. But they are not the slippers I ordered, and I got no warning that I would receive something other than the pictured item."
3,Wrong item sent,"I researched the slipper I wanted and finally settled on getting the one I saw on Amazon. What I saw was not what came to me. The one I wanted had a high top that would cover the lower part of my leg, as I get cold easily. A Velour Boot slipper. The one I received was a moccasin type slipper that doesn't come up over that part of my leg.I am not happy with this item. It might be fine for someone who wanted this type.I do not!"
1,BEWARE!!!!,"I brought these slippers for my Mom for Christmas. They are nothing like the picture. This company misrepresent this item. The slipper were of poor quality and didn't look like the picture at all. When we call about the problem they said they would sent a return packing label. They lied about that, we waited 2 weeks no label, we called again and still no label. This looks hopeless"
5,Can recommend the DF402 as a better replacement.,"I had this slipper as shown and loved it but I wore out the soles so was looking for a replacement. When I found this on Amazon I was elated until I read the reviews that this is not the slipper being shipped and I did not like the style at all of the replacement. So I checked all over for the closest one style wise and found the Dearfoams Velour Boot with Frosted Fur Lining DF402. It does not have the ribbon with bow in front and the fur lining does not fill the inside as in this one, but it fits fine and is warm. It looks almost the same from a distance so I am pleased. I hope Dearfoams brings back this older model but in the meantime the DF402 is a good, similar replacement."
2,too small,I have size ten feet and they didn't feel comfortable in the product. Gave them to my sister who has smaller feet- 9 1/2
3,Not the missing link to a happy life you may be searching for,"After reading the other reviews for this book one might believe that this book is that ultimate self-help book in the pursuit of happiness that so many seek. Not so. The book has some nice considerations regarding trying not to sweat the small stuff but nothing that hasn't been published by others again and again. The section on diet is extreme. If you follow all of his diet recommendations I'm not sure what will be left for you to eat. The yoga poses that are in the book are fine but limited, it focuses much more on his philosophy than the physical aspect of yoga. If your looking for a book to read to de-stress you could read this book and it may help you. Then again there are hundreds of others that could serve the same purpose."
5,Excellent yoga book,"Very good book on Yoga philosophy. I didn't find the references to certain studies very scientific though. But as a philosophy book it's very well written. For example, my favorite quote from the book is:""The extent of a person's evolution is proportionate to their acceptance of the unacceptable""I'd recommend ""Happy Yoga"" even for people who have no intention of practicing the physical side of Yoga."
5,Really love this book,I was trying to find some yoga DVD's with Steve Ross but no luck that is when I found this book which is a really good one if ur into yoga and self help this is a must read at least I think so.
5,Excellent book to help you understand the gifts of yoga,"I love this book. It has already helped me change my perspective on life and appreciate my yoga practice more. It gives helpful tips, playlists, and instructions on specific yoga positions for certain sensations. It has really helped me to deepen my yoga practice and made me want to learn more."
2,For true yogi's,If you are a true yogi this book is more for you than if you do yoga on a casual basis. I do yoga a couple times a week and this book is to advanced for me. I had a tough time connecting to it though I did read it all the way through. So would recommend if you are wanting a deeper connection to yoga.
5,Happy Yoga,"Great Book!!! Contains some yoga postures but mostly gives really good advice on diet, lifestyles, outlooks, and inner peace. Lots of short and simple meditation exercises. Will change how you look at the world and all the beautiful things in it."
1,argh,"man, i bought this and i thought it would come with a mattress and it didn't. for this i think the company should at least have the courtesy to refund us or at least give us a free mattress, because buying another good mattress would cost about the same i paid for the FRAME... with NO MATTRESS!"
2,Buyers Beware!!,"This Futon Frame is pretty good, except for a few scratches and one piece that needed a little hammering, but please be aware that there is NO MATTRESS included with this Futon."
4,serves the purpose,"The actual curtain is not quite as full as the one shown. It serves the purpose, but I expected a little better quality. The beads are held by thin wire which sticks out where the beads separate too much. Most of the beads are very thin and some are already splitting. We'll see how well it holds out."
1,JUNK. Landfill. Loose Parts...Do not order these unless you want to assemble them yourself.,"I got these and remembered the saying ""you get what you pay for"" when I got them. Upon opening the box 2 strands fell to the floor that were not attached and others were coming loose. The seller BEWILD said I can pay to ship the defective items back to them for a refund. If a seller ships defective items they should pay for return shipping. Pay the extra $$ for a good set..."
1,Disappointed,"Sorry to report that I am disappointed with the quality of my beaded curtain. The banding on the top looks dirty and some of the strands of beads were broken on arrival.I, however, decided to keep the product because I was in urgent need to cover a space in my hallway which is highly visible. I have managed to make it work for now.Thanks,Kathleen"
2,product not as shown,"The beads and bamboo strands were inconsistent. One strand was missing all beads and bamboo, others were broken. In order to have one satisfactory panel, I had to restring 2 sets into one panel."
2,Not as expected,The bamboo beaded curtain looked much better in the photo than in person. There are very large spaces between each link of beads and it was about 6 inches shorter than the door. I had to use a backup curtain to make it look ok. Never going to order from these guys again.
4,Ichiyo School of design.,"Delightful 8 1/2"" X 5 3/4""(wide) paperback for Japanese flower arranging. There are 11 full page photographs that could be framed;18 pages of text for elegant and simple arrangements;and 37 pages of a yearly engagement calendar which could be copied and used for any year.The Ichiyo School was founded by Professor Meiko Kasuya"
4,Good buy for the bucks,"A pair of these were purchased to use on camping trips,,Weight is excellent and design is acceptable..Units arrived with normal "" China in a box packing"" ( some nicks, dents and scratches ) setup required a lot of "" tweeking "" especailly the handelbar assembly ... For a folder, its a good buy for the $$$ but don't expect to take it out of the box and ride off into the sunset without having to play with it first...."
4,"Easy, light with convienent mobility",Good product. No assembly was required. Very easy to fold and un fold. (Watch the process on Youtube) Does require a additional chord to tie up after folding. The side stand came off on first day. This was fixed quite comfortably as it only required some tightening.Cycle is a beauty and really light. Serves commuting purpose but definately not for the fast lane or long distance cycling. Overall an excellent product well worth the price.
3,You may need some improvements,"When I rode this bike first, my feeling was so sad because I had never felt such a bad ride quality. After my first riding, I bouht a $20 seat and $8 pedals. By adding these accessories, the quality was dramatically improved.Wheels of 16 inches are slightly small for me, and if I buy a next folding byke, I will select that of 20 inches."
5,Fun mini bike for kids and adults,"Fun mini bike. Easy to fold and unfold. Easy to transport. Good for paved road. Rear brake cable snapped during a 20 miles mountain bike ride in Grand Island, Michigan. Fortunately I had a repair kit to fix it. Front wheel was trapped by sand and I got thrown out once but bike did not break. Some people laughed when they saw me riding this little bike chasing my kids riding full size bikes."
2,Decent design - Poor Execution,"I put it together, but then the handlebar wouldn't come out easily for folding and puting in the trunk. Also, the shift mechanism in the rear wheel has very little clearance from the ground.Visually, the finish quality looks very good however.Not suitable for kids - the height is ok, but the reach for the handlebar is very awkward at low seat heights"
3,Demise of DCOM,"This book was meant to help readers do DCOM more efficiently. But after learning about the gory details and ever-shifting underlying plumbings which may well defeat all one's efforts, the only conclusion is DCOM should never be hyped. Java and .Net are the far better solutions. Don't even mention the DCOM security stuff that make it a hell across domains.Hey man, you should told us that DCOM deserve to be dead at the beginning. :-(COM is for desktop, period."
4,A good COM book,"This book borrow the format that made the Effective C++ popular. It presents 50 tips on COM. Its targeted audience is developers that have been using COM for a while. Prior knowledge of COM is expected for reading this book. In general, it provides very good tips but the only exception is the section about MTS. Maybe the tips are good but I do not know as I have never worked with MTS. That section contains 8 tips of the 50 tips of the book."
3,"Best vitamins, but the taste is horrible","I've tried most Emeregen C products and loved all of the flavors except this one.. I can't even describe how horrible it tastes (and leaves an aftertaste). It almost has a ""propane gas"" flavor to it, which is the best way I can describe the horrible flavor I experienced after drinking some of this.. I had to give the rest away. Oh well, I think i'll stick with the Raspberry and Tropical, which are by far the BEST flavors!"
1,Tastes Horrible,First let me say How much I generally LOVE Emergen-C. I have almost every flavor in my house and I drink 2-4 packets a day. I have a condition which requires lots of electrolytes and so I drink lots of fluids and Emergen-c. I prefer The tangerine and the Raspberry. Super Orange is good to. I bought this new Ruby Lemon Honey because a friend of mine was starting to get a cold and I wanted to try the new floavor. Its sounds yummy right? WRONG!!! It tastes and smells like the inside my my husbands workboots. I felt horrbile because she had never used Emergenc-c before and I raved about it for months. She let telling me how horrible it was and I did not believe her until I stated it and it was totally gross. I am not sure how this flavor even made it past a taste team. Please dont buy this flavor because it is really really horrible. I am taking it back to the store.
2,"Has good vitamins in it, but tastes ""eh,"" smells worse","I'll just say this:It has great vitamins in it, but try not to inhale when opening a packet. The smell is bad--like something vaguely sewer-esque, something fetid. Another Amazon reviewer said ""cat pee"" and I would say that comes closest. The taste is a lot less severe than the smell, but it certainly does not taste like ""Ruby Lemon Honey"" as the box claims. If you want all these extra nutrients, proceed with caution."
4,"Lots of vitamins and minerals, flavor is okay","I really like that it contains so many vitamins. Unlike the regular Emergen-C, this contains 100% your daily value of zinc. However, too much zinc makes me nauseous so I wouldn't take more than a couple of these in a day. The flavor isn't the best in my opinion. It's okay, but I like the Acai berry, tropical, or super orange flavors better. However, I think this would really be great to use while sick. I gave some to my 3.5 year old yesterday as she's had a bit of a cold (half a packet at a time). We'll see if it helps!"
3,"Tastes tolerable, smells like cat pee","Pro: I'm pretty sure that I averted a cold by taking this stuff.Con: The other reviewers are correct; this stuff smells awful. Luckily the taste isn't THAT bad, but it certainly smells like pet urine or something equally offensive."
2,This stuff tastes HORRIBLE!,"The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because it really works. Someone earlier said that this is the only flavor that works - wrong. Maybe for that person, but for this person, they all work equally well. This flavor just happens to be NASTY! I can't even open the envelope without gagging. It stinks. And then, it doesn't mix/dissolve very well. Every time you burp, you get a terrible aftertaste - and when you're sick, this doesn't help much.Emergen-C is awesome! Just steer clear of this flavor."
2,works but extremely gross tasting,"i have a really bad cold and a runny nose. so i thought drinking some emergency would help. so i bought this flavor, thinking it would taste great...i was DEAD WRONGmost horrible flavor ive ever tasted. leaves the nastiest aftertaste too. and even when you try to wash that taste away, you get it again every time you burp. and yes. it smells like some kind of nuclear gas or something. really... its not pleasant. but it does work. just dont get this flavor..."
2,"If it wasn't Grossman, it would get a 1 star","I adore the books written by David Grossman. This is, to my mind, by far: the worst he's ever done. It was panned in other countries for good reason: It's absolutely juvenile and puerile and all the run on sentences that worked in See:Under Love do not work here, in a story about Nothing, one lonely guy's neuroses. So, I think it's his name, a great writer's name, that is selling this book. Not the content. It's awful."
1,"Cliche, anyone?","My mother always told me you should read the first twenty pages of any novel to find out if it will be any good or not. However, after only fifteen pages of this book and a quick skim through the rest I have to say that I found it entirely unoriginal and disappointing. This novel fails to deliver even its premise (which should've sold itself)!Discriminating readers would do well to check it out from the library prior to purchasing."
4,Haunting and memorable,"Certainly not the easiest novel to get into, but with time and effort, ""Be My Knife"" packs an emotional punch that stays with the reader long after the last page has been turned. The narrative develops at a pace not unlike a snowball, gathering in intensity as it progresses ... and the final image burns itself deep into the reader's consciousness.A love story between two ordinary people (told only through impassioned letters) dealing with loss, disillusionment, and the everyday. ""Be My Knife"" haunts..."
2,caphalon saucepan,"I bought the calphalon one set previously and like that-but this pot is rough on the inside-very heavy and of course, you cannot mash potatoes in it-I was disappointed in my purchase-altho the buying part of it was easy and very quick--"
3,"Joan Rivers, Having a Baby Can Be a Scream","I was disappointed in this book. I thought it would be funnier but it actually was more informative than anything else. Any one having a baby would enjoy this, I think."
5,neck firming cream,I like the product and it helps smooth out the wrinkles quite well for the price.
5,"Outstanding, clear, practical","This book is a perfect companion for wannabe-evangelists, or simply to understand the mechanisms behind some kind of ""marketing"" efforts (such as Dallas Mavericks' or O'Reilly Media's) that can be unclear at first.I suggest it, a great purchase!"
5,A heart warming insight into successful corporations,"I approached this book with the thought ""another marketing fad"". I expected some practical advice, maybe some ready to implement procedures etc.Instead I indulged into an almost novel-like reading. Each chapter tells a story of a successful company (ranging from a multinational IBM to a small consultancy of 10 or so employees), who put an emphasis on being authentic and serving the customers instead of boosting their advertising budgets. And it paid off manifold.The book inspired me enormously. It does not bring a ready to use blueprint, it rather tells you to use your imagination and the knowledge of your customers to find the way to capitalize on it."
4,a book whose time has arrived,"McConnell and Huba encapsulate the essence of leveraging existing customers into third party endorsers to the outside world. As a marketing consultant, I found this book an informative and enjoyable read with real-life examples of proven strategies to ""spread the word!"" Recommended to any company who is serious about growing their business via keeping the customer in mind."
4,Non nova sed nove,"A great book in line with Guy Kawasaki's Selling the Dream. It's not just a me-too book.If you want your customer to become your best sales people, don't pass this book by. Invest in it and into Ben Mc Connell's Citizen Marketers: when the people are the message, as well as in Andy Sernovitz's Word of mouth marketing.If you're making an e-commerce website, you would simply be a fool not to study the subjects covered by this book. It can also actually be applied to any modern form of communicaton including blogs. The only (small) critic which may be presented is that the author's approach is top-down when good word of mouth is, most of the times, user-generated (see MySpace and YouTube)The author however did a really good job. Worth not only your money but devoting some of our precious life time to learn from it."
2,Not for small businesses!,"I run a small service office and found very little here.Made for ""bigger"" companies...75% of book are ""case studies"" of how others are doing what they recommend...which is very little concrete.Moove on..."
1,Has little to do with Creating Customer Evangelists,Creating Customer Evangelists has little about how to create Customer Evangelists. Lots of stories of lucky companies.
2,Misleading Title.,"Beautiful homes, but out of 211 pages of plans only 11 were under 1500 sq. ft. I wonder what size they thought ""small house plans"" were?"
3,"It really is ""for kitchen use only""","If you're looking for a grinder to use for your medical marijuana, this is not what you're looking for.It feels cheap and while it would work perfectly fine for breaking up your medication,the screen is too small for a kief catcher.I haven't used it yet, but i'm worried about using it because i don't want to lose valuable kief, i use it to cook with.If it's just for kitchen needs, I'm sure it works great.I'm not sure what rating to give this, as it doesn't suggest what you might actually be using it for, nor does it state strongly on here that's it's only for spices, and honestly most people who would buy this would only want it for one kind of herb, which isn't quite compatible with this product."
1,Awful.,"The grinder is great, and it works well. However, that is only when it comes in one piece. I recieved this grinder broken and out of working order. Anonying when this was to be a christmas present."
5,Video by Bongs N Pipes,"Length:: 0:21 MinsThis is a quick stop motion video of the grinder in action. I use it and stand behind it. It has help up for 3 years now. The peas I used are very hard so it will have no problems chewing through anything you throw at it. Sorry about the shoddy quality, Amazon will not let me upload in true quality..."
1,This book is loose leaf and doesn't have a binding,"I ordered this book for my class because it was the cheapest available. They don't explain why it's like fourty dollars less than the same edition. It arrived loose leaf without a binding and now I have to send it back and wait for a bound book to come, all the while I won't have my book to do my homework. (And I'm pretty sure I will get a gift card balance for a refund, not my money back which means Im out seventy dollars) If I were to keep this book I couldn't sell it back when I'm through with it which means its pretty much worthless unless you want to keep the book and don't mind it being in a three ring binder."
3,Cute songs!,"Some are a little hard for younger kids to follow along -- songs are pretty fast -- (my boys are 4 & 5), but good for kids 6 and up!"
5,Very cute CD,I was planning a road trip with a 2 year old so I figured some good music would be necessary. It took me a really long time to find songs that I thought would be perfect for my two year old and something that my husband and I wouldn't want to blow our brains out listening to. I came across this cd and sampled all of the songs and liked it a lot. For the price it's an excellent buy.
3,Selected songs are good,Overall the album is average. We just listen to ones that are good and skip the rest.
2,review,My daughter is 4 and it looks from the cover that it would have something to do with Mickey Mouse but it doesnt.It is not really even kid songs so I am not sure why there isa mickey mouse on the front.I thas songs from the 60s my daughter doesnt listen to it.
1,Yikes! At least a 9 on the parent irritation scale.,"I bought this CD for our 12-month-old son. He's not too interested in it. I think it would appeal more to the 3-6 year old crowd.Not only that, but the songs are pretty irritating. In fact, I've put it on about 3 times, but have never been able to bear listening to the whole thing. By the time it gets to The Spectrum Song, which is sung in a German accent with a lot of unnecessarily rolled R's, I'm ready to switch to something else. If you want a cute kid's album with silly songs, get John Lithgow's ""Singin' in the Bathtub."" I sing those songs to myself when I'm at work!"
2,I don't have but...,"Just looking at the picture, this machine seems to have problems. How the heck do you reach if you're a short person? I don't see steps! I also do not like the strange curves on the pull up bar; it should be straight with additional handles. No? Like I said, I don't have this machine, but I am looking for a pull up dip station. I don't think I would buy this one. It looks fancy in the picture but that's just that."
4,Another Gorman triumph!,"This prequel to The Day the Music Died isn't quite as good as the first book, but it's still very, very good. As usual, Gorman creates a fantastic, vivid cast of characters, each with their own particular quirks that place them just left of center, and sets them all down in a compelling murder mystery. The period detail seems to capture the 50s without being heavy-handed. Let's hope there are many more Sam McCain novels to come in the future."
3,Not terrible,"Right off the bat I have to say the writing style just didn't work for me. It tried to be conversational but I felt that it was just a little weird. People may well disagree with me and that's fine I just don't like it when the actual narration is written conversationally on top of conversational dialogue.I like the idea of this book but at the same time I think the namedropping of famous things and people leads into dangerous territory. When you rely heavily on ideas that aren't your own to make the story appealing you risk making it ... not appealing. This book definitely strayed into the ""not appealing"" territory on more than one occasion. I think the author was trying to be funny and I did laugh at parts but I think some of it really should have been dialed back.The story is OK. The plot is OK. The characters teeter. Those who are interested in the 50s may want to check it out but I'm not sure if it would appeal to a wider audience as it currently is."
5,One of the Definitive Trio Recordings of Vitro's,"I first heard Ms. Vitro 15 years ago in a small club in Manhatten. I realized recently that my recording of Softly is scatched..and I must have another!..This is a great vocal jazz cd. standards and great ballads, with Fred Hersch on piano, what could be better than that. This is a must for any vocal jazz fan. Vitro is one of the best. Lilian Frean"
3,Not That Great,"This album is a disappointment for me, mostly because I find Morse's interpretation of Rhoads' guitar work to be mediocre. I also find Jimmy Barnes vocals a poor match for the material. Daisley and Kerslake doing this record is as bad as Sharon Osbourne pulling them off the original releases of Blizzard and Diary all IMHO of course.I like the Randy Rhoads Tribute CD better than this, for the Ozzy covers anyway..."
2,"It uses VELCRO, ugh!","No where in the item description does it say that it uses Velcro to keep the wallet closed. I feel like a twelve year old whenever I go to pay for something. It makes that loud separating Velcro noise every friggin' time. And unfortunately for me, it's not an ""amazon.com"" product, so the return process isn't as simple. I've been using it since 09/2007 and it still looks new, so that's a plus. And the outer edge is a harder material that just doesn't seem like hemp, though I'm not an expert and it could be. There is a plastic cover on the one side (inside) to hold your DL or other identification."
5,as described,"good, informative book. this was purchased for a class i was taking on genocide. it is interesting and useful, helped out with the class a lot"
2,Not a Garden Delight,"Workable, but tedious novel. Characters are not well developed and the plot is tedious and often unnecessarily confusing. Uneven story line with irrelevant sidebars. Needs a good edit."
2,audio version of Snow Garden,Reader goodStory line intrigingCharacters were extremely disfunctional... which put a real downer on the whole experience....Won't listen to it a 2nd time...In fact the audiobook is an instant donation to my local library... someone else may like it...
5,Leaves me wanting more..,"Having read both of Christopher's novels,I am definitely a fan, follower and am inspired by his honesty and truths.I love his ability to bring you right into the emotion and passion.At night we close our doors to the world and Christopher allows us to open them with emotion and understanding.I want more!"
4,"Good story, just takes a while to get going..","Being a fan of Anne Rice's books, I was automatically interested when I heard her son had taken up the family craft. While I thought A Density of Souls was a bit on the thin side (I read it in under 3 hours) I still enjoyed it and looked forward to more from Christopher.Bottom line: this book was good.. not great, but good. Mr. Rice is clearly still developing his story-telling skills and character development ideas, but this book was much better in terms of both than his first. He has a clear sense of suspense building and plot twists (some of them are a bit much to swallow) .. and while I did get somewhat bored in the course of reading the book, I never lost interest.It's awesome to see someone so young be so capable at writing and showing an interest in it. Instead of knocking him down for the areas he's still developing, I will continue supporting his books. I look forward to reading his third."
5,"""I'm just here because of the brochure.""","Fantastic novel. Absolutely fantastic. Editing, not so much. Lost a whole star because of it!!!I read this book after Rice was recommended to me by a friend who shares my love of all things book-related. I'm not typically a big fan of the thriller-mystery type, but I was immediately infatuated with this book. Rice has a unique and dry writing style that I fell in love with.His editor, however, should be shot. There were quite a few grammatical and editorial errors that should not have slid past anyone, but because it was a great read, I let it slide. However, in the future, I may just have to write a letter. :)Great read. Great style. Great."
2,The Snow Garden- Keep Trying,"Having read almost all of Anne Rice's books, I had to try Christopher Rice's The Snow Garden. Although it was an interesting story, the ending was somewhat unsatisfying. Also, having some gay characters gave the story interest, but having so many of them seemed forced and detracted from the story line. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the way Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights is featured throughtout this novel worked well. The way that it influenced the characters, however, seemed a bit far-fetched."
1,Horrible,"Incredibly T...E...D...I...O...U...S... I have seldom had so much trouble finishing a book. I was just so bored. I don't deny that college students have lots of pointless, meandering conversations about philosophy and the future. I just don't care to read them word for word. Then there was the plot, which just fizzled. Once you find out what happens to the characters, you'll not only be confused, you just won't care. Save your money and read something by Anne Rice instead."
4,Well...,"I was a HUGE fan of A Density of souls, but this book was just not up to par. It was good....but it seemed like a 16yr old wrote this.The story it self was good, but the evolution was minimal and it just seemed i read and read forever before getting anywhere.All in all, i think you should read this book, but don't get too excited over it, or you'll be throughly disappointed.(i give it a 4 b/c i can't give it a 3.5..)You should definately read this before DofS if at all possible.You should also check out Poppy Z. Brite if you like Chris.You should read Lost Souls or Drawing Blood by Poppy even if you don't like Chris."
2,who did the proofreading??,"I have to admit i am only up to page 50... but this is absolutely the worst editing in a ""real"" book i have ever seen. I am reading an Advanced Reading Copy and at first thought that was the reason for misspelled words, incomplete nonsensical sentences etc... But i just read your readers' reviews and apparently that is not the case.. The book is just poorly edited... I have a hard time really getting into the story since just about every page has an error. Needless to say it is very annoying.... maybe i will try to muddle thru but (how does this happen?????)"
4,Sophomore Effort Worth the Read,"Although Christopher Rice's 2nd novel isn't as good or ""charged"" with passion as his first, ""A Density of Souls,"" it does still reflect Rice's excellent writing style. His ability of visual description and dropping the clues to the reader throughout the entire book is astounding. He dangles the information in front of you and you're left with always wanting more. None of the characters are especially likeable once you find out their secrets and pasts, but Rice does have you interested in each and every one of their lives as you unravel the mysteries. This reader for one can't wait until Rice's 3rd novel...whatever it may be."
1,This novel gets a Raspberry from me,"Disappointing, disappointing, and what do you know, disappointing! That just about sums up my feelings towards this book after doggedly ploughing through the entire thing. Obviously, literary talent isn't hereditary in the Rice family. I havn't read crime thrillers since many moons ago, so when I decided to pick one up again and decided on Snow Garden, I thought I was in for a night of exciting action. I was proven wrong. By the time I had gotten through a quarter of the book, I knew it was a lost cause. Granted, one shouldn't be expecting beautiful lyrical prose in thrillers and in-depth character delineation, but surely one shouldn't be served with truckloads of surfacial details (e.g. about art), attempts at creating multitudious oh-so-quirky homosexual relationships and a plot that sinks to abysmal depths!! Seriously, if Chris Rice has any writing ability at all, I hope he shows it soon. This novel is a very disappointing showcase of his talent (if any)."
1,Give it a miss!,"The Snow Garden is one of the worst reads I've had this year. The distinct lack of editing proved to be a huge stumbling block. Rice does not yet have the sophistication to be able to keep multiple plot lines running and this results in characters who seem to be motivated by schitzophrenic tendencies when this is clearly not the auhor's intent. When the characters do behave rationally they are one dimentional and I found none of them believable or even remotely likable. This is particularly true of the main character. My final complaint would be that too many characters are gay. This is also a problem I had with his first novel which, in comparison, was a far better piece of work. I think the publisher has given Rice a lot slack because of his name, which pretty much guarantees turning the company a profit. I am skeptical that a first of second time writer would get this published without having a mother who's so well known."
1,Slow and Boring,"I have no doubt that Christopher Rice has talent but you wouldn't know it much from this novel. It's so boring. Nothing happens. I actually managed to get half way through the book and was so bored with it, I just stopped. NOTHING HAPPENS...Certainly if it did, it was someplace after the middle of the book!"
2,Thriller not very thrilling,"After reading Christopher Rice's first book, I was expecting another good one. Yet, I was very disappointed with this book. It was too much of guessing who did what and why they did it. I was left feeling confused as to the motivations behind some of the characters actions. Not enough of the characters' past was revealed, which did not help explain their psychological problems. At the end, the reader is left feeling as if so much has happened yet nothing was resolved."
3,A writer on his way...,"I just finished The Snow Garden and like Density of Souls, I found it interesting but both novels were confusing in many places and a lot of reasons ""why"" events were happening were never brought to light. We needed to know more about Jesse, whom I feel stole the show. Although some of the plots get twisted up within themselves, I believe that Christopher is on his way to becoming a good writer. He's young and just getting started - he will grow into his stories."
4,Great Read,"I've read both of Christopher Rice' novels and they are both excellent reads. The characters, plot pacing and suspense are all well enough. My only wish would be to see slightly more believable finales. Of course, maybe the slightly-unrealistic dramatics are what make it interesting.....In any case, it's a great book."
2,Hate to say it...but don't waste your time or money.,I had a very hard time finishing this book. I was hoping that it would deliver much more with him being the son of well known writers...I was wrong. To me the characters were bland and not well-rounded. The plot didn't make sense to me either. Overall I just felt it was written by someone not very experienced. I will give Christopher Rice another try but I'm going to wait for him to have a couple more books under his belt.
3,Too bad to be good - too serious to be good [stuff],"This book kept me reading, but it makes me wonder, how old is this kid, 15? ... I think it could've been much more redeeming if the characters were at least LIKEABLE. Kathryn is an extremely boring non-personality - it's like Rice couldn't make up his mind whether she was supposed to be a tough chick or a sweet, naive, prudish ""chipmunk."" April's point of existence is to stand around and observe and make comments about Kathryn and Randall. Randall is...what? A huckster? An orphan, it goes no where. And I mean, there are too many villains - who's really the bad guy - Jesse, the grad student, or Michael Price??? Too many psychos in one place to be believable. All in all, Rice really couldn't seem to decide on the POINT. As I got further and further toward the end, I got more and more anxious, wondering - how can he tie up all these loose ends and bring it all together to make sense in just 100 pages...and he never did."
4,A great second novel...,"Chris' novels (all two of them) have a habit of setting up these extremely detailed worlds, with characters that you really get to know and care about. Then, towards the end of his novels he brings those worlds crashing down with twists in the character's histories that wern't revealed-- sometimes not even to the characters themselves. It's a neat device to use, and it keeps the last third of the book VERY fast paced and riveting. I enjoyed Snow Garden alot. It had a wonderous level of detail in the writing. My only hope for his next book would be that he sneaks in some hints of what's to come earlier on so I can look back and go ""OH YEAH! That's what that meant."" Nice work Chris!"
1,BORED ME TO TEARS.....,"This was the most boring book i have ever read....after reading 3 chapters of boring chatter about homosexual lovers i put this book down. I had high hopes for the son of anne rice but the story never took off, like a bad B movie it just went on and on and on.."
4,The Snow Garden,"Having enjoyed Density of Souls I was pleased to find this book as equally as enthralling. Publishers reviews seem less then flattering. My advice, ignore them and read the reader reviews. I read this book in a day, having been unable to put it down. I think that is the best compliment anyone can make about a novel. I felt cold and menanced in the hieght of the Australian summer, such is the skill of this young writer.I hope there a many novels to come."
3,A whimpering second novel,"The second Rice novel is something of a mystery again. Rice weaves gay and straight characters in such a way that, while his main characters are gay, his novel resembles fiction written by straight authors in that the sexuality of the character is only part of the story. Neither book is a gay book.The novel involves several freshmen at a prestigious eastern university, who are trying to adjust to college life. Some are not what they appear. Jesse, Kathryn and Randall are hiding things from their past. Unfortunately, these hidden secrets, once revealed, are not all that compelling. The mystery part of the novel involves accidents that may have been murders. And these are never really clarified.The book engages the characters in engrossing conversation, but the characterization does not seem to move. Jesse Lowry, for one, is intriguing, but is dispatched with his secrets not fully explored.Rice's first novel has more power in its mystery. This novel whimpers."
3,Left me wilted,"I admire Christopher Rice's courage in embracing a set of gay characters. However, I was disappointed overall with this novel. I thought I would be up all night reading this work after getting ""hooked"" from the prologue; and I did stay intrigued for awhile. But, I found the writer simply tried to put too many plots going on that didn't tie together. I found myself hurrying to finish the book-not because I was anxious to see what was going to happen, but because I had other things I was more interested in reading after this book lost its fizzle. I agree with another reviewer that the editing was very poorly done. (I noticed in one spot that Paula, the dead wife's sister, was referred to as Lisa, the dead wife in addition to the other mistake mentioned in the other review.) If your book budget is limited, I would skip this one."
2,Christopher could learn from dear ole Mom,"I reviewed Rice's first book , whcih I thought had some problems, but compared to The Snow Garden, his first novel is a Pulitzer in disguise.I think Rice's talent as a writer is evident, but the plot and pacing is just all wrong. I was put off by the twist ending. Instead of being surprised, I felt manipulated.I also hope Rice fires his editor. At one point Randall grabs Tim's belt (while Tim is only wearing boxers, mind you) and toward the end the novel Ken approaches the closet, turns into Tim and then turns back in Ken. Supernatural forces? Naw, just baaaaad editing.I will give Rice one more shot. I read his books in nearly one sitting (no doubt because there is so little there), and I sincerely wish him luck in the future. I just hope he lets his Mom read his stuff first, like any good kid.My two cents."
1,Not worth the time,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It's boring, the story line was terrible, and there were numerous grammar mistakes (at least 100)."
4,if you're not expecting much...,"if you're really not expecting much from this book, then it's not all that bad. Wandering through barnes and noble one day i stumbled on this book and became bretty interested to see if he actually had any talent as a writer, or if he was just going off of his last name.Well, I don't think he is a horrible writer, and honestly i don't find the book to be that horrible. I however wasn't expecting much so that probably has a lot to do with it. The information on the back cover was horrible misleading I honestly thought the book was going to be about something completely different. Also the editing was pretty horrilbe too, I suppose he can't really be blamed for that completely.I think if Rice just sharpens his story telling skills he'll grow up to be a real good author, currently however his novels are decent enough if you're just looking for a quick read with no real thinking involved (I read this book in one evening with no difficulties)"
3,A Good Read,"My first encounter with Christopher Rice left me feeling like the money was well spent. Not the most prolific writer, he certainly has a way with words and I found myself drawn in by the story and the characters. At times it was difficult to discern which was present day and what was a flashback, but I still kept on.The plot devices are often sketchy, and the characters seem very stereotypical, but it's worth the money if you can find it in paperback. I am inclined to pick up the first novel and see how it compares, and also to see what he is able to do in the future."
2,Same old themes,This is Rice's weakest novel by far. If you are going to make implausible situations seem real. then you need to believe in the characters' voices and trust them. I could not warm up to the character who walks away from one life and is able to start anew under a new alias.
4,"""Mi Confidente"" de Corrine. EXELENTE!!!","Este disco de Corrine es exelente. Una produccion de RMM Records dirigida por Ralph Mercado e Isidro Infante. Corrine tiene un estilo de salsa unico. Temas como ""Figurate"", ""Mi Confidente"", y el gran exito ""Uno De Dos"" a duo con Michael Stuart son una verdadera pieza de salsa moderna. Corrine una exelente cantante con una gran calidad interpretativa."
5,outstanding,"A reading group friend brought this book to a meeting for us to look at. I was immediately taken by the gorgeous art work, and surprised that it was a work by Ricky Nelson's ex-wife, Kristn. I remembered her from her days on the old ""Ozzie and Harriet"" show, but had no idea that she was a talented artist. I was intrigued by the idea that the book included both her art, and selections from her many years of journaling. This book did not disappoint. It was an absorbing art experience, as well as a look at all of the changes we all experience as we move through our lives. I wish she would publish another book that continues her journey through her art and her life."
5,Where Are You Kris?,"I still take this book out from our huge home library -- sorry, we have a lot of books -- to look at Kris'paintings and the subtle words that tell about her life.Ricky was my first love. I was seven years old when I first heard him sing ""Travellin' Man"" and the family meant so much to me as a child. I know they weren't real now, and Rick and Kris' children are all grown and Ozzie and Harriet are long gone. But... Is Kris still painting? Where are you, Kris? Remember Saint Martin of Tours in Brentwood?"
5,Must have album,"This is a great album from a great voice, each song has a special meaning to me. Each song send a letter to someone out their must have album"
3,I prefered the original edition,"I don't like the larger size of this revised edition, it doesn't fit with the others in the series now. And I don't like the new cartoon-like illustrations. I know they need to update the information in science books but there was no need for a new size nor new, less appealing, illustrations. That said, I love this series - it answers so many questions curious children have about the world clearly and simply. My son ate them up when he was about 4."
3,good for kids just learning about the solar system,"I have a 5 yr old that loves anything to do with space. I got older (adult) books from the library about the solar system and he learned tons of info. When we got this book he was excited but he didn't end up learning anything new. The book mostly talks about the relationship of the planets to the sun, their order, if they're hot or cold. They grouped the planets together stating which ones were hot or cold but didn't individually talk the planets other than saying you can see Mars early in the evening and Earth is the life planet."
5,Out Of This Place,"I got this book for the boy I nanny for. He is on this kick about anything to with outer space. He loves it, and I don't get sick of reading it to him. Good buy if you love space."
3,Pretty good but not great,This is quite large and will not fit many fixtures. It is supposed to be high CRI (Color Rendering Index) but a Minolta spectrum tester shows a lot of green and it is deficient in red and blue. The 5100K is nice and it is overall a good value.
3,O.K. but don't last as long as state,"These bulbs did the job. Their small size allowed concentrated light with a tiny profile, fitting perfectly my needs. The negative is they did not last anywhere near 10,000 hours, though the newer LEDs don't last as long as they are suppose to either. When these bulbs blew, I purchased then again anyways."
5,"POST-PUNK that pulverizes,not preaches","this is it ladies and germs,this is godflesh(r.i.p. you sexy cyborgs) covering WIRE.....this is FUGAZI dropping the politics but not the pretense or power....if the melvins for some ungodly reason became a LIARS cover band...it might come close to sounding what is (ATF) assaulting my senses as my vision blurs and my fingers tremble...all you gotta know is ALEX ""PROPER/BOMBASTIC DRUM SOUND"" NEWPORT not only produces/mixes this but FRONTS it as well...and if that means nothing to you i hear HOT TOPIC is having a sale on BRAND NEW hoodies...."
2,Okay...but...,"I was hoping for a more ""traditional"" style dissection of the themes and events in 'The Invisibles'. Or at least some more in-depth interviews regarding the series. To be fair, the new Grant Morrison interview is pretty good, and it is nice to have the annotations in one volume (opposed to the online sources like Jaybabcock.com and Barbelith.com), but I guess I was expecting a more serious, perhaps even literary, view of the series."
5,"A fun, irreverent read!","What a fun book! Other series guides seem to be pompous, overly reverent affairs, but a cheeky tone (on the part of both the writers and their interviewees) make 'Anarchy for the Masses' a breath of fresh air. 'The Invisibles' is a series open to many interpretations, and wisely the authors shy from providing one, opting instead to provide tools for fans to make up their own minds. The interviews are good, tracking the creation of the comic book with a sometimes-unexpected honesty. If you're a Grant Morrison fan, you've got to read the huge interview here. The definitive look at 'The Invisibles!' If only these guys had written that ponderous 'Sandman' book..."
4,a helpful read.,"i haven't finished reading this book yet, but it helps to tie up all the little things i didn't quite catch about the invisibles. also it includes a list of all the books that are referenced in the invisibles, which i think i'll have to read next."
2,George is great,"This CD seems pretty good, however, I have experienced difficulty getting it to play. I have had to clean it numerous times to get songs to play properly. It was sealed when received in a plastic wrapping, but w/o the seal along the edge. Price was good, maybe too good."
4,nice introduction to rings and fields,"This text presents an introduction to rings and fields at an undergraduate level and corresponds to that portion of a course on abstract algebra that covers rings and fields. As with other titles in the S.U.M. series, this text has a nice selection of exercises accompanied by worked solutions, making the text helpful for unguided study.The Kindle edition is presented using the mobi flowable text format rather than the print replica format and the result is quite disappointing as is too often the case with attempts to present mathematical material in eReader formats. The typesetting suffers from bad line wraps on inline formulae, orphaned headings for theorems, incorrect indenting of material and so on. All of these conspire to convert what is a nicely typeset work in physical print to an annoying and irritating eBook experience."
3,Good and bad,"Red is the best of Ellis's 3-parter blitz. It promises much early and delivers late. As to why it was paired with TSW, easily the worst of the 3-parters, i can only assume there's a surfeit of whisky going around at Wildstorm HQ. TSW's plot key is a clever idea, but it's just not enough to hold up the messy story, and the art is muddled and just too busy. A rare Ellis misstep.Red is the story of a retired CIA assassin brought back into activity by a misguided bureaucrat. Tokyo Storm Warning is Battling Seizure Robots with a twist."
3,Not excellent but great study guide...,"This book is a great study guide for the CLEP Sociology examination BUT I strongly suggest that another textbook be used as a backup for additional reference. I found that the explanations in the back of the book provided more details than the chapters.I'm going to take a chance and purchase REA's History to the United States I.Good Luck!!!By the way, I passed the CLEP Introduction to Sociology on the first try."
3,OK but somehow lacking,"I took the test and passed- which I am happy for. But this book did not cover many of the sociologists who were on the exam. This book is designed to give an overview but I would recommend getting a good college textbook in addition to this and do a little indepth reading on the major players.Not only do you have to know the theories and terms, you have to know HOW to apply them.All in all- gives good direction..."
3,The Best Test Preparation for the CLEP Introductory Sociolog,"An ok study guide for the money. Only about 25% of the questions I recognized, anyway I passed the exam with high 50's."
5,"Memorize, memorize, memorize","I bought this book and took the test in 02/01.After three weeks in which I read the book front to back and memorized all 300 qustions I took the test and past with an 90% score. This was my second attempt at a CLEP, and as before felt very comfortable during the exam. Keep in mind that any questions you do not recognize, skip. If you guess it may cost you.Good luck."
4,great book for clep; not enough info,"OK the book is great as far as about 1/2 of the questions on the test. I took it a week ago and passed just using this book with a 62. The whole time I was taking the test I thought I was going to fail for sure, because the test has a ton of questions not even covered in this book.I suggest buying this book, studying the questions and answers, and going to college board or another college website and taking their practice tests too. By the way....INDIA is the country closest associated with the caste system :-)"
1,rip off,Not the edition I ordered. Has markings all throughout the book. I think I got a different one than I ordered. Do not trust Internationalbooks.
3,Best Test Preparation for the CLEP Introductory Sociology,"The summary sections of this book were very brief, however, the sample test questions include all the correct answers. I found the answers and their explanations to be the most helpful part of the book. I would recommend this book to others."
5,All you need to pass the CLEP Sociology exam,"With this book alone you can take and pass the CLEP Intro to Sociology exam. I have never taken a Sociology course. I bought this book, studied it for a couple of weeks and passed the test. The important thing with the REA books is to not only read the study guide part, but also read and re-read the explanations to the answers for the practice exams. In fact, I think the explanations for the practice tests were more useful and comprehensive than the study text itself! Get the book. Study it. You will pass the test."
2,Good but not all you will need,"This book provides some a outline to sociology. However, it does not prepare you for the difficulty level of the CLEP exam. This book is informative, but will set your expectations of the exam too low."
5,GORGEOUS,"Very Beautiful and very believable. Super comfortable. I am actually going to purchase a second band, to flank the other side of my wedding band!"
5,Georgeous... Everything about Eden is georgeous!!!,"If you ever got the opportunity to see Eden perform in person, you are truly blessed. Her musical talent is unrelenting in it's ability to capture you and not let go!!! Once you put her CD's in your player, you're not going to want to pull them out for a long, long time! From her hauntingly beautiful ballads, to her fun style with songs like, ""Everything I've Got Belongs To You"", I haven't spent a Sunday morning without her!!!Eden, we miss you in Chi-town!!!Keep singing... Please!!!"
4,Great Pot,"I had one of these before I got divorced. My exwife took it when we seperated. I had been given a cheap...scratch that...not so cheap set from somewhere, which included all sorts of little extras, and it was all stainless steel. Problem was, I couldn't get the flame anywhere between full blast and off. To top it all off, every single fondue dish burned to the bottom of the pot. That went in the trash after about 3 uses, and I ordered my simpler Circulon Fondue Pot. Nothing sticks, clean up is easy, and the flame stays just where I want it. It was worth spending less money."
3,"great fondue pot, flimsy burner","the actual pot is of good quality, and the non-stick coating works great. it has a small design flaw; the screw that holds the handle sticks out on the inside of the pot and is hard to clean.the really weak part of the package is the burner. it's a low-quality el-cheapo flimsy thing. in my case, the plastic part of the lid fell of the moment I took it out of the box. what's worse, it's only made for fuel paste, not burning alcohol. not only is fuel paste many times more expensive, it's also much harder to get - many supermarkets don't carry it, so be prepared to run across town to find some before you can enjoy your fondue."
5,retrospective,"This album is a subtle masterpiece. I've had it for years, and I appreciate it more every time I listen. Very emotional, melodic. The songs are melancholy but hopeful. It's a bit like looking wistfully back on childhood dreams that have been lost among pressing adult concerns. The album is often run down, described as ""pretty good dance music"". If you listen, you may see past this surface. Give it a try :)"
3,Planning a project - Projecting a plan !,"I haven't bought this book. But from the book title itself, i can assume its contents - somehow !. Seems to be a good book and it should be with every Java beginner. (Not in hands only - But in their minds too !). I wish the publisher all success in their future ventures..Thank you."
5,"This is the ""User Manual"" for living","Susan Thesenga writes clearly in an honest and down-to-Earth way. This book has the capacity to change a life.Although you can read this book any way you want, for me this wasn't a read it once and put it on the shelf kind of book.Every time I've read it I've come away with another ""Ah HA!"" concerning the distortions and truths of my life. If you've found this book while browsing the web, I suggest it may have found you! Go for it!"
3,Stamps,The stamp holder works very well. I was disappointed at the number of stamps it holds. I by stamps by the rolls of 100. This holder is too small to hold a roll that size.
4,A Tuneful 50s show,"It seems easy to dish Happy Hunting, Ethel Merman wasn't that happy in it and didn't get along with her co star Fernando Lamas, the song writers were untried and never wrote another show, and on and on. But..........the cast album has always been one of my guilty pleasures, something I love to listen to, and have since I was a little boy and a friend of mine's mother had it. As much as Ms. Merman said she didn't care for the score, it provided her with yet another indelible number for her repetoire, Gee But Its Good to Be Here, which along with Mutual Admiration Society, Mr. Livingston, New Fangled Tango, and If'n make for a rather fun score. Merman was in teriffic voice when this album was made, and everything about it was professional. True, the story is tied to an event that is now ancient history and therefore probably not revivable in any way, but still the cast album is a load of fun. Would that some of the shows being written today had songs this good."
2,"OK, but...","Nice looking socks, but they are so paper thin and light I don't imagine they will last long. I figured these socks would be better quality with the Tommy Hilfiger name attached to them. Guess not."
2,Not Impressive Socks,"Socks does not stay up and you will be constantly pulling them up; the socks are comfortable, but the slippage is not worth the comfort."
2,Not elastic enough,"These socks are perfect for those who want a tight fit. If you are looking for an elastic pair, look elsewhere."
3,What?,"This is missing a LOT! So many things are missing it's easier to figure out what it has than what it's missing. A few things missing that come to mind are the new version of the carousel of progress, both versions of Golden Dream, any Light Magic music, short version of The Main Street Electrical Parade, and Makin' Memories. These can all be found on other albums but this is nowhere near close to complete."
5,A Musical History of Disneyland,I gave this boxed CD set to my 11 1/2 year old grandson for Christmas (something that was on his wish list; he is a huge Disney fan). He absolutely loves it. I enjoy listening to it as well. The book that comes with it is also nice.
5,I go to Disneyland now whenever I want to...,"After numerous visits over my lifetime to Disneyland, I can go whenever I want with this CD set. I received it as a gift and it's really a wonderful set. Highly recommend to any and all Disney fans!"
4,Received 3 days before it was expect,I rate it with 4 star because the book is wrote.I received 3 days before the date they put.
4,. Thank you Amazon,"the book is clean, new and same as what it said on the website.Thank you Amazon ."
2,Covers material but rambles badly,"Larry Crow apparently knows a great deal about Remington, its guns, its history and how to disassemble and assemble a 870 shotgun, rifles, and some 22s. He covers the disassembly and assembly, but it is interspersed with history, discussion of other guns, and future course information among other things. He shows various steps with a gun and a factory cutaway (a helpful thing), but occasionally does not position the gun so you can see the parts he is talking about. There is a camera operator he talks to that should recognize this situation but he doesn't. I have not watched the course through, so I don't know if he covers it completely or not. I find the course very tedious to watch.If you will follow the manual that comes with the gun carefully, it should cover what you need to know, at least the basics for a 12 gauge. I bought a 20 gauge, got the 12 gauge manual. There are some differences which I find to be significant (you decide)."
4,What could be more funny than clueless Russians?,"I enjoyed this book. The story of the Russian fleet's journey to Tsushima reads like a black tragicomedy. This fleet which couldn't navigate consistently, maintain a formation, or even keep order among their crews was expected to travel to the other side of the world and defeat the battle-hardened Japanese Imperial Navy. Even to one unfamiliar with the outcome of the Russo-Japanese War, it very quickly becomes evident what the outcome of this battle will be. While The Fleet That Had To Die is the story of a fleet's journey to its death, this somber aspect of the book is frequently overshadowed by the hilarity of the clueless Russians. Their blunders on their way around the world are side-splitting."
2,Not as advertised,I didn't know I was receiving an acoustic version. I bought the cd because I'm taking a french course and wanted to hear people singing french.
2,"Comme-ci, comme ca...","Although the instrumentals are nice, this CD wasn't quite what I thought it would be. For some reason I thought the songs would be sung, but instead it's all instrumental. If that's what you prefer, then you probably would enjoy this CD... I was just looking for something that included the lyrics; I wanted a collection of classic French songs sung by the original artists. This is definitely not it... guess I didn't do my homework. C'est la vie!"
3,not quite La Francais,I was not over thrilled with the cd. It did some justice to theFrench music but not to the extent that accordians are used.Instead of this cd I would recommend Sur Le Pave by The Magic Accordians of Adriano.
4,Tres Romantic,"I love French music classics, this CD has most of them. I actually bought this CD for my significant other and we listen to it most of the time. If you like the old-Frech touch and romance in music I would recommend the CD. Good Listening."
1,Too much like elevator music,"While the songs on this disc are generally recognized as French, the performances are too flowery. The flowery nature detracts from the overall French experience. It is not what I expected at all, especially based on the other Amazon reviews. The arrangements on this disc remind me of elevator music."
4,A French Collection,"I purchased this CD with another CD that was strictly French Accordian music. This CD contains many French classics, but it won't remind you ""street music"" you actually hear in Paris. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys classic music, especially when it's French."
1,Too old school no singing. if your over 70 you may like it.,Looked fresh and new. but the sound was a very 50 style with no singing. Darn wanted it to be good.
4,Romantic for sure,"Listening to this CD transports me to a cafe in Paris no matter where I am. Very enjoyable. I play it over and over. Highly recommend it. Listen to it with or without someone you ""love."""
4,Make your courtyard french,"This is just what I was looking for,an intrumental cd to transform my courtyard into a french cafe,"
5,C'est L'Amour,"Whether or not you've ever been to France, this warm and sunny collection will transport you there! Many of the selections are very familiar to American listeners. The great mood music keeps on coming. With so many wonderful tunes, this item delivers terrific value for the money."
2,BIG LETDOWN,Not what i expected at all. I could not find a clear explanation to improvisation. highly unrecommended
3,Typical murder mystery,"This is more about style than substance. I enjoyed all of the classic mystery elements, from the detective's incessant yelling to the lady journalist's relentless pursuit of ""the scoop."" Visual quality is pretty good--except for Boris Karloff's makeup. That's just laughable. Overall, this is an entertaining flick, but it doesn't hold a lot of surprises."
4,Part of the Mr. Wong series,"Based on Q. Wiley's leaves inevitable Oriental detective Mr. Wong, Boris Karloff is called upon by his detective friend to solve the murder of undercover detective Dan O'Grady that includes smuggling. James Lee Wong informs Capt. Bill Street (Grant Withers) that he can only help if it has something to do with the Orient. He is assured that it does have something to do with Chinatown in San Francisco and that's as close as you need to get to the Orient. They're both assisted by the feisty beautiful newspaper reporter Roberta 'Bobbie' Logan (Marjorie Reynolds.) So once again Mr. Wong puts his life on the line."
2,disappointed,"Was eager to read this book because Chuck Palahniuk raved about it. Found it rather BORING. I didn't find it stimulating or emotional, as suggested by his recommendation. Could just be me though-I will not pretend to be an expert! Her language has good flow and the words painted good pictures as you read, but I guess it was just missing that... special spark for me."
2,"Great sentences, poor stories","I picked up ""Reasons to Live"" based on Chuck Palahniuk's sterling recommendation in his book ""Stranger than Fiction."" Hempel's collection contains 15 short stories -- very short as the pieces average about 8 pages each.Her writing is very clever (as promised), but left me uninterested. The tiny length of each story made the characters and their situations too opaque to care about. Hempel can certainly write a great sentence, but not a great story.One footnote: ""Celia is Back"" clearly mirrors a story Palahniuk tells about his own father. I must admit to wondering if some of the high praise came from personal association more than objective evaluation."
1,i strike out again!,"boy, am i in the middle of a reading slump. a whole chain of dull books have fallen into my hands lately, and this is one of them. I recently got a book entitled: ""1001 books you must read before you die,"" and this was one of the 1001 books listed. it is the 4th book i have read based on the recommendations of ""1001 books..."" and i am now afraid to move on to a 5th suggestion. this little book of stories was about as far from a ""must read"" book as i can imagine. cookie-cutter writers workshop pieces that are pretentious and absolutely unmemorable. the only thing i liked about this book was that it was short."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"Final Copy is a superbly original mystery, set in the world of journalism. Addy, the main character, is wonderfully developed, someone I'd love to know in real life, with her great sense of humor, intelligence, and human frailities I could definitely relate to. The supporting cast are just as well drawn, the writing is top notch, and the plot is intriguing. The ending really knocked me for a loop! Hopefully, Final Copy is only the beginning of many more Addy McNeil mysteries."
4,Investigative Reporter Provides New Twist for Mystery,"I thoroughly enjoyed this break from the typical mystery genre. Told from the viewpoint of an investigative journalist, this mystery unravels around the protagonist at the same time her life is just getting under control. Jan Brogan's novel is impossible to put down, as each turn in the story propels the reader on to a new, and sometimes erroneous, conclusion. Reporter Addie herself provides the ultimate surprise ending, and all at once the reader realizes it's the only choice she ever really had. Have a great time reading this one, and keep your eye out for Brogan's next. Personally, I can't wait."
5,A Kind Cut,"I didn't particularly like shopping for a pair of scissors in the women's cosmetic aisle, but that's where such small, personal scissors are kept. Someone shopping online might hesitate to buy an item not seen in the flesh, so to speak. These scissors are indeed 3 and a half inches in length, are light, and are easy to handle. The blunted tips and curved blades are nice safety features. For trimming facial hair or even fingernails, these scissors perform wonderfully. For clipping toenails I still use the large, toenail clippers.I'm very happy with these scissors and would make this purchase again."
4,target review,"I like that there are 2 different targets, one on each side. I don't like that the paper is pretty thin and tears too easily. The Gamo targets are better in that respect."
1,what,THIS PRODUCT might be okay if I GOT IT! COMPLAINT SENT NO REPLY X TWO! CAN I GET SOMEONE TO LISTEN?
3,"I like, like this cd more, more than any other by D.M.","I guess i'm in the minority with this opinion, but this is by far the best cd that I have ever heard from Dave Mckenna. It is a very exciting cd. It has already become my favorite cd by Dave.On this cd Dave plays a lot of my favorite songs. He uses great control to not mess up these songs. He does improvise a little, but not to any extreme. He gives most of the songs a nice taste.You jazz fans out there, listen up. This cd is one that you will cherish. Please give this cd a chance.Recommendation: Buy this cd and enjoy!"
2,Good if you have no management schooling,This book is probably great if you have no management schooling but if you do it's just going to be a long repetitious review.
3,GOOD PRODUCT,GOOD PRODUCT FOR A NORMAL HAIR. MINE IS KIND OF DRY SO IT LEAVES MY HAIR A BIT UNMANAGEABLE...WITHOUT A GOOD CONDITIONER I WILL SAY DONT USE THIS IF YOUR HAIR IS DRY OR WITH ANY CHEMICAL TREATMENT.
2,Slow and boring movie.,"Despite the great cast, this movie is very slow and not much of a plot. Great to see Nick Nolte, John Heard and Sissy Spacek however."
5,Between endless worlds!,"After Rivers Gonna Rise, Peter Baumann ex-Tangerine Dream begun collaborating with O'Hearn by producing and mixing his albums. The ex-dreamers influence can be found strongly in this album, Ancient Dreams and Indigo. The music here is getting close to new age, darker, moodier but still not missing the joyous and playful elements of Rivers.. or El Dorado particularly on ""Forever the Optimist"". Every track here has an impact on the listener depending on the interpretation and only PH can do it. Many of the songs here will carry you to the apex and then drop you gliding with satisfaction. An example is 87 Dream of a lifetime. This music was my life sountrack 20 years ago, in my moments of solitude I play the tape cassete now that I have it on cd the memories come in full vividness. The music here is timeless as best portrayed by the cover of a world over dry land. The world is hope and joy and the crack land is the melancholic side of this album."
2,A Worthy Effort,"Thatcher (first or last name?) finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time and thus engages the reader in a fast-paced motorcycle journey through biker bars and murder. Knowing little about motorcycles and even less about biker bars, it was a great introduction to that world.This book screams for an editor--someone to put the Thesaurus back on the shelf, someone to suggest more natural turns-of-phrase. However, the story doesn't need much work. The many twists did not lead where I expected--except the last turn. The ending was contrived. The suspense ended with a laugh."
4,"Very sweet story, but sometimes difficult to read","This is really a lovely book. The story is sweet..a nice extension of the original Twinkle, Twinkle song. The illustration are just lovely, and somehow shiny on the page, making my one year old love to touch them. My only caveats are that some of the lyrics/words are written in gold ink, and that makes them difficult to see in certain lights. Also, when you sing it, make sure to set a fast enough pace, or else it is a LONG book! Because it's so sweet and serene, it's easy to start off slow and cuddly, but by about the 4th page, you're losing their attention and your patience. Overall I'd recommend..it's just beautiful to look at. I also like that the pages are paper, but a little thickier -- sturdy enough for little hands to turn and thumb through without tearing."
3,Difficult to read!!!,I agree - why did this product get such high reviews? There is print that is absolutely impossible to read (i.e. dark print on dark background) - what type of publishing company would allow this? Save you money for other books to share with your child... I wish I had!
5,Love it!,This is a wonderful bedtime story for young ones. The illustrations are nice and the pages are nice and sturdy.Only very minor complaint is a couple pages have gold writing on a dark blue background and it can be a little hard to read unless the lights are on.But soon enough you will have the book memorized and it won't matter...a very cute and catchy nighttime story and certainly a keeper!3 of my daughter's 5 favorite bedtime stories are by this author.
2,Difficult to see words,"I'm not sure why everyone loves this book so much. There are at least three pages on which there is extremely dark lettering on a very dark background. Whoever made the decision to mix these colors made a terrible mistake. It's to the point where you literally can not read it comfortably and there is no way my son will be able to try to read it by himself... he won't even be able to see the words! Maybe if the next printing has light colored text on the dark backgrounds it could be better, but as it is now, this book fails at its main purpose: it is impossible to read."
5,"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, I Didn't Know You Traveled So","Far. This is a delightful continuation of the nursery song ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."" Through the ten additional verses, a wish is granted and a small impish girl is taken on a trip through our solar system, and ends up back safe in her bed. This book has vivid, colorful,eye catching and amusing illustrations. It is a must for the young readers library."
5,Great stress busting book - good idea for Xmas stockings,"I'm a father and thought this would be great to entertain my kids whilst travelling next year. That'll certainly work but it's also a good adult fun book with various 'how too's' like; How to phone in well to work, How to switch off the telly, How to have piggy-back fights etc. Certainly worth the cash - I know a few members of my family who'll be getting a stress busting copy this Xmas. Top bananas."
4,Pleasantly simple,I am set to wondering whether the previous reviewer has heard of the phrase 'tongue in cheek'.
1,Too sticky-sweet :(,"These are gross, plain and simple. The banana overpowers everything while tasting completely fake and preserved and just plain nasty. The coconut variety is much better."
5,An Icon as Human,"There is a statement at the end of the book by one of Woody's children comparing Woody to Lincoln. The comparison was how certain individuals become mythological cultural icons, yet were actually mere human beings.This book was an easy read and very entertaining. Oh, perhaps I no longer worship Woody as much as I once did, but knowing about his many faults only makes for a more interesting story. How can a person fight so much for all of humanity, yet be such a poor husband or father? Thinking about this I recognize that this has been the case with many great people. Good read."
5,Perfect fit!!!,"I just received the case today. This case is a perfect fit for my DMC-FX01 camera. The leather material and the inside soft material are good too. The color is a bit darker than shown on the picture, but regardless it still looks stylish and cute."
3,Not up to par with the old masters,"I bought this album on the strength of the reviews here and brief samples available for download. I love Exotica music, but once you've got some Denny, Lyman, and Baxter, it's tough to find anything contemporary that comes close. Well, this does come close, but it's just not quite there. There are a couple things in particular that got in the way of my enjoying this album. The first and biggest complaint is the over-reliance on synthesized instruments, which you don't totally get the feel of in the Amazon samples. A bongo drum track and synthesized vibes make me think of a recording studio, not a tropical paradise. Also, some of the vocals sounded a little tinny and grating to me. From now on I'll stick to the work of the past masters. If you are considering buying, I'd recommend going to the Don Tiki website and listening to some of the samples there. They are longer than the Amazon samples and will give you a better feeling for what the music really sounds like."
5,"This CD is VERY exotic and a ""must-have!""","While visiting Hawaii on vacation, I took a gamble on the hip tiki-style cover and soon realized that I had found a gem among the fodder. These sultry and exotic beats will transport you to that tiki-torched lounge by the lagoon, while sipping your Mai-Tai. This is it!"
5,Ultimate Driving Music,"I saw them play at the Hawai'ian International Jazz Festival, and immediately bought the CD after the concert.... played it in the rental cars driving all over the Islands... Drove down Chain of Craters Road to it, drove around rainforests, around O'ahu, to the piers on Maui to get to a snorkeling expedition.... perfect. Now I play it whenever I have a long drive... I hate to drive, and long drives are a real drain.... not with this in the CD player. Had a friend in the car with me recently... and she fell in love with the CD too... and is likely ordering a copy for herself soon."
4,"Interesting, timely information","I bought this book for a course, but I found it very easy to read and very interesting. They keep everything up-to-date so it's best to buy the book when it first comes out (at the beginning of the year). By the time the end of the year comes around, the book loses its power, and you need the new year's edition. But I would buy it again, it is a great source of information."
5,new old skool,"the real gem as with most of formats albums and tunes, isn't the beats, the loops or grabs, but Abdominal. with lyrics that slip and slide with grace and amazing speed, hes the shining star on formats tracks. with a new buddy d-sisive (british), a new star is born. orginally a roadie for J5, many styles and influences have grown within formats albums. he brings new hope for a young generation. seriously just buy the album, drop the acts, u'll be bloody suprised, im open minded but this is party popin, back-seat banging fun at its best."
4,hard tech step,"this cd is great for the kid that's just getting into jungle...this will show you the world of the only type of jungle that matters, tech/hard/evil-step...if you don't have the opps to see a live set, and get free demos at jungle parties every week like i do, then deff buy this cd. the bass lines are grungier as always, and the tempo is up there! buy this!"
3,Decent Import From England,Some hard techstepping jungle. The Dj does make a few (slight) wrecks on this cd.
1,Completely wrong product,I ordered a Sylvania H6054LL Halogen Plus Headlight in a Red Box. What I recieved was a standard Wagner Halogen H6054 in a Blue Box. But because I need these headlights now I have chosen to install them. I probably will not buy from here again.Stephen Skeen
2,"Okay, but nowhere near as good as its predecessors","This book is okay, but nowhere near as good as its predecessors. It is comprised of short stories -- often rather verbose short stories -- rather than the short, meaningful passages in the earlier Chicken Soup books. The earlier books are studded with post-it stickers saving the innumerable passages I want to reread or frame, and I frequently think back to those wonderful passages. Not these -- there isn't a single post-it sticker in the entire book, and I'm donating it to the charity fair since there's nothing worth rereading. To be fair, I suppose that this might prove helpful to someone overwhelmed by insurmountable problems and in need of reading sappy boring story after sappy boring story -- but I, myself, was much more humbled and inspired by the earlier volumes."
3,"Above most servings, but still far below the first one","Perhaps the words ""for the Unsinkable Soul"" had misled me to over expect, I was quite disappointed. The stories are relatively plain and uninteresting. It's a complete stereotype of the first three servings, but with much less glamour and appeal.In case you are still very satisfied with the third serving, which I believe only people who had completed the first three servings would look for a book like this, go for it. If you had already been tired of the third one after the first two, this book is not for you."
5,Ancient Dreams The best of the New Age era,"I share the same enthusiasm as my fellow reviewers here. For a short period of time in the 80's we had New Age music. Which of course was a subjective category. It encompassed all sorts of kinds of musical styles ( usually instrumental). Patrick O Hearn might have held the title as the best of this era.Wonderful soothing synthesizers with crashing, primitive percussions along with exotic flutes and other musical instruments from around the world tied together in a transfixing musical combination carrying the music along winding through your imagination. Turn off the lights and let yourself experience this CD with your imagination. Even after all these years I find this CD better than ever. Time has not dated it. It sounds as fresh and introspective as ever."
1,Do NOT buy this!!!!,"I purchased this DVD to help my son with his math. The DVD was likely filmed in some guy's basement. I kid you not. There is NO production value. A Joe Pesci looking man standing in front of a plate of glass writing algebra equations on it. That is it. I though it would be a Bill Nye sort of approach to math. Not at all. The DVD says professor X2 is ""Wacky"" and ""Eccentric"". This consists entirely of him raising his eyebrows and throwing his hands up in the air. He is downright scary at times. BORING. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!"
4,Buena muestra de poesía barroca,"Una excelente producción culterana de poesía amorosa, escrita por la ""Décima Musa"", Juana de Asbaje, transmutada en monja por obra y gracia de la época contrarreformista. Se ofrece aquí una sarta correctamente elegida de estrofas clásicas de la mejor poesía española, con graciosos juegos de palabras, dilogías sorprendentes, ""conceptos"", metáforas asombrosas, etc. El esplendor de la lengua española y la frescura y gracia de una intensa voz femenina."
4,Approximate English translation,"An excellent, cultured, lovely publication of poetry, written by the ""Tenth Muse"", Juana de Asbaje, a nun changed by work and the grace of the Counter-Reformation. A chosen classic collection of the best of female Spanish poetry is offered here, with graceful word games, surprising dilogues, ""concepts"", amazing metaphors, etc. The splendor of the Spanish language and the freshness and grace of an intense feminine voice."
3,"Great poet, spicy translation","The translation of the poems here are just a bit of a stretch, I think. I'd rather read less extrapolation and more proximity to the literal, especially when I begin to feel the translators may have had their own agenda. They may have made the poet's words a bit too explicit. Having said that, Sor Juana is simply magnificent, in this rendering too."
3,its alright,Smaller then i thought but it fits my basic wire set up. But otherwise it durable and it has a space a peice on the top for my business cards too which is nice so i dont forget em!
5,Bag of Holding,"It is a Nice, though, durable bag that swallow everything i need for my small PA system in one gulp:1 Kustom PA501 Behringer zenyx 502 mixer4 Mics (3 in a plastic hardcase)1 Portable DVD player1 ART MP Mic pre-ampSennhiser headphonesPower cords & surge protector, Mic cords for all the aboveI cant find anything to complain about with this. I plan on buying a second one for another PA 50 rig"
1,Underwhelmed,"I purchased this bag to carry my two American DJ Starball effects lights. I had anticipated a heavily padded bag and was fairly underwhelmed when I received it. I then tried placing the effects units in a $6.00 Trader Joe's insulated grocery bag, which has a lot more room (handy for tossing in the power cords) and is as padded as the Arriba, if not a bit more padded. Live and learn."
4,Awesome design but drags a bit,"I love the character designs in this series. Though still clearly rooted in typical Japanese cartoon character design, the characters have a very modern feel which is mixed with a seventies anime nostalgia. The result being a very clean, stripped down, at times almost Bruce Timm / Batman the animated series style.Being a comic book artist myself I can really appreciate the work put in to make these characters look so good.But, the story isn't quite as cool. It's fun to watch, don't get me wrong! It's very enjoyable but, at times, it begins to drag. However, this is due to the first DVD being so action packed. This batch of episodes are more character driven with fewer giant robots and space battles. Thankfully, the characters are very likable. Just be ready for a change of pace after the first DVD.All in all, this is still one of my favorite ""anime"" DVDs and hope to get the whole series eventually."
5,Two of the best players in Jazz,"This live performance demonstrates that the best musicians do not need to spend months in the studio to produce a masterpiece. This was part of one evening at Berkeley's Maybeck Recital Hall where Alan and Gary played an exquisite performance. The songs were written by a variety of songwriters, including Alan, Cole Porter, Charlie Parker, and the incomparable Tadd Dameron. Every time I listen to this recording I hear something new. It is so rare to hear two musicians work with each other with such sensitivity. If I could keep only one recording from my collection, this would be it."
4,Karloff pulls it off!,"The two main characters in this movie are twin brothers, both played by Boris Karloff. One is pure evil, the other is unbelievably kind. Only an actor of high talent could give credibility to either of these two extremes - Karloff plays both of them perfectly! I would've never thought Karloff had such range, having only seen him in ""monster"" movies like THE MUMMY and FRANKENSTEIN. He does it with what appears to be no effort at all. It's an interesting tale - though it does get a little bogged down in some spots. The special effects are also first-rate, considering the year in which it was filmed. Sit back and enjoy a real master at work!"
1,Written for five year olds who can read.,"After 70 pages of really trying to like this book I threw it and another unread Carol Higgins Clark book in the wastebasket, lest some poor unsusupecting person happen to find them and waste her time. This ""author"" insults her reader by explaining the obvious. For example, she tells us that the protagonist is bored by the airline attendant's canned speech, and then she proceeds to quote the speech. Duh, Carol, even five-year olds know this speech!"
5,Unputdownable,"This is one of my most beloved websites ever, and after voraciously devouring CHC's ""Snagged"", my first Regan Reilly mystery, I was utterly aghast at the unbelievable one-starred review. I believed this book to be one of the best mysteries I've ever read. And I've read neary 300, and I think I'd know a lemon when I spotted one. CHC keeps the suspense moving right along, the story is...usnagged, unsnared, unhitched, hurtles along the pages like a wildfire. Okay, so the ending is just a tad too pat, a tad too perfect, but it's still a great novel. She writes like her mother, in the same classy, almost elegant style. I, personally, think CHC is a much better novelist than actress. Do yourself a good deed and pick up a paperback copy of ""Snagged"". You'll be sure to enjoy it."
1,snagged,"I have read many of Carol Higgens Clark books and loved them. This not so much. This must be one of her first books which I did not realize. I am reading it just to find out how it ends, but I must say I skip over many pages as is boring. I usually like alot of characters, but these are confusing to me."
3,ok,Wish she were as good a writer as her mom. I enjoy her mom's books so much. They are easy reads.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3,Mistakes ruin the good read!,"While I am liking the stories in Carol Higgins Clark's book, I am shocked that a book can be sold with so many mistakes in spelling. The stories are well written and a great light read. But there is one major detraction in all her books so far. Obvious mistakes in each of her first three books make searching out the real word comical. 111 is substituted for I'll several times, main character's names are hyphenated various ways, or mangled badly....it's just surprising that books purchased on a Kindle can't be corrected before being sent out digitally. I can't wait to start the next book to see how badly the spelling errors can be in a book for sale."
3,"Fast, Fun Read!","The second in the series, this book has main character Regan Reilly in the middle of another predicament. While in Miami for a weekend wedding, her uncle is also trying to sell the patent on some apparently amazing pantyhose at a convention in town. Throw in the tension builder that the uncle is trying to earn enough money from the patent sale so that he can buy the retirement home where he lives with his friends before they are kicked out on Monday. Regan doesn't do nearly as much sleuthing in this story as she did in book one, and she saves the day at the last second but not really because she's a private investigator. As in the previous book, the plot gets bogged down a little in the middle and then has a rushed ending where all the loose ends are neatly tied up. Not necessarily convincing, but still a fun read."
1,Surprised and disappointed,I started reading Carol because I am so fond of her mother's writing. I am quite surprised and very disappointed that she has chosen to take the Lord's name in vain in this book. I enjoyed her first book but am not sure I will read any more!
2,very fast light read,"If you need to kill some time in a waiting room, I recommend this light reading. The book reads quickly , I like the wriing style, and overall the story is ""fun""... as fun as senior citizens watching Matlock daily in the nursing home. There is no real violence so it is very sedate and you'll be able to go to sleep without checking under the bed. The suspense really revolves around the sale of the pantyhose rather than the characters being killed. Overall, if you need to forget your troubles, dive into this book which requires minimal brain activity."
4,Great Cozy,"I think Carol Higgins Clark's work has been unfairly compared to her mothers'. Mary Higgins Clark's novels are suspenseful and heart stopping. The creme de le creme of the genre. Her daughter's books are cozies - great to relax on the couch in front of a fire with a nice cup of tea. Snagged had the right mix of mystery AND humor (those indestructable pantyhose are a hoot!). I think she proves that though she may not be her mother, she is a top notch writer."
1,In a word - INSULTING,"This book is insulting to readers of average to above-average intelligence.To say it is difficult to get published is one of the understatements of the century. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to get published these days. Average writers can forget it. Good writers, probably not. Great writers, maybe... just maybe, if your agent and the publisher are in a good mood.Therefore, you don't see much drivel making it to print anymore. I don't even know if this book is good enough to be called drivel. The immature writing is below sub-par and the characters are so flimsy that they don't even qualify as ""cardboard"". Even the basic premise of the book is so thin, it should never even have been made into a short story.But I guess, when your mother is one of the most exhaulted mystery writers of all time, you're allowed to vomit text on to a page and expect to get it printed. Must be nice."
2,The pantyhose aren't the only ones running....,You may find yourself running to the trashcan to toss this clunker. It is a passable diversion while sitting at the beach or riding public transportation (though only if you don't have some better written mindless book available) but that is about it.Is literary talent a product of nature or nurture? Apparently neither.
1,"Snagged, but not Fleeced","Even children would find this book simplistic and moronic. Who exactly is this author writing for? I see that her next book (Fleeced) has had its publication date delayed.... maybe her publisher finally wised up. It's a shame that Carol Higgins Clark has to trade off the good name of her mother, Mary Higgins Clark. Snagged tries to be funny but falls flat. The plot is paper thin and you feel like you've ingested junk food after wading through this clunker. And these one word titles (Decked, Twanged, Snagged, Fleeced) smack of some big marketing promotion to lure us into a purchase that we normally wouldn't make."
4,WOW !!,I see from the other reviews that people either LOVE this book or HATE this book! I think its fun and written well -- I canNOT agree with those that put it down. Read it and see for yourself.
5,The Best Instrumental CD I've Ever Heard,"I have been a fan of Patrick O'Hearn for over 10 years. ""El Dorado"" was my first exposure to his music and I still believe it to be his best. Unlike keyboard artists such as Vangelis, O'Hearn integrates electronic instruments with acoustic, creating a ""landscape"" of sound that is truly extraordinary. The ""rain stick"" on the title track is a perfect example of how he so masterfully intigrates primitive, acoustic instruments with the electronic. With songs like ""Delicate,"" I have heard no other artist who can musically set a mood of such deep serenity. All of O'Hearn's CDs are worth owning, but this one remains my all-time favorite."
2,"Subtitled ""El Siesta""","This CD is a re-issue. I have listened to the previous cassette release at least once a year since it came out over five years ago. Unfortunately, it has all been for naught because I cannot convince myself that any track in this album is worth cueing up - and believe me I have tried. O'Hearn is not effective at teleporting us to his exotic titles, entertaining us with the remarkable sounds of his equipment, nor impressing us with musical genius. What's left? Can I dance to it? Not if I am sober. The only positive thing I can say (which keeps the 2nd star in this review alive) is O'Hearn's background electronics can be somewhat intriguing at times. But the empty simplicity of the melodic line insults our intelligence. The mind drifts off the music quickly, as it does not earn our attention. If you are an O'Hearn fan, this is bottom-drawer O'Hearn. At best you can use El Dorado as party background music - as long as there are other CDs in the player in random track play mode."
4,very fast shipping,"Nana soundtrack wasn't what I thought it was... you know a soundtrack. When you think of a soundtrack you think it will have the songs that were in the show, movie, etc. this did have those things just not the main songs like the opening or ending songs [which is what I wanted] they should have put some sample songs or at less wrote what kind of song where on this cd. There are 44 songs on this cd but only the last song had any words in it.just a note: that last song [#44] sounds like I've heared it before on the radio but of couse in english.the reason why I gave this a 4 star rate is because I should have looked on other sites to see if they had any sample songs and because the shipping was fast."
5,Two Inspiring Books for the Thinking Person,"During the early summer, two of my best friends, both women in their 40's, died of breast cancer. I searched for books that would offer me help with my grieving, and a perspective on what I was going through. Most of the books I found were long on faith and hope, and short on thought.And then I discovered two books, both recently published, that saved my life. These were Harold Kushner's ""The Lord is My Shepherd"" and Dennis Shulman's ""The Genius of Genesis."" I thank Harold Kushner and Dennis Shulman for giving me a way of understanding life and death in a broader context.Both of these books tenderly guided me toward understanding and healing, and, for this, I am grateful."
2,"Sadly, this is a message that further divides the world","I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today. He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.Why define the world as divided so in the first place? Terrorists are people too. Nature is people too. Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in ""good"" and ""evil"" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world. Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion. Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided."
3,A Fan Souvenier...,"This book while featuring some brand new images that I hadn't seen before in detail, still stuck with the same images that can be seen briefly in the Harry Potter trailers. There are really no new images, like those that will be seen in the Vanity Fair issue coming up. However, it's a nice collector's editon for die hard fans like my daughter. It will be nice for her to have and keep so when she grows up she can show her children how fanatical she was towards this book. It's just a nice fan souvenier in the end."
3,OK but not the best,"This is OK but I like toys better. Personally I wouldn't buy this. I mean, once you hang them up all they do is sit there. It's not as good as other things."
1,Absolute Junk,"This is the worst tent I have ever owned. I am not new to camping in a tent. I was a boy scout as a kid and have spent many rainy nights in a tent. I received this tent as a wedding gift a few years ago, and it is very roomy...I'll give it that, but when the rain comes it leaks like crazy. Even if there is an excess amount of dew in the morning you'll get wet. I think the problem lies in how the tent poles come together at the top center of the tent. The connector piece touches the rain fly and wicks the water in. The top of the tent without the rain fly is screen mesh. So when the water wicks in it runs down the screen, pools up, and eventually falls through. I even added a seam sealer to the rain fly, and water still came through."
1,Piece of junk,"Would never buy another tent from Target. They wouldn't take it back. Had it in the first rain while using it a few months after purchasing, had between 2 and 4 gallons of water in it by morning. Luckily we could get inside a house. All our stuff was soaked."
5,Gotta have it!,"I am surprised, I didn't know that Lucie could sing. And sing she does! She has a wonderful ""quality"" to her voice, and I can't wait to buy the CD. Only wish that the samples were longer."
1,This cd had the potential but...........,"Before I bought this cd I had always wondered what Lucie's voice would sound like. Now I know! Bad news, her voice is not that appealing. It appears that Lucie was a bundle of nerves while singing on this cd. On every track I noticed that her voice quivered. Surely this is not her normal sound?For the brighter side of this cd, her repertoire was good. Her arrangements were ok. Her voice I thought had a lot of potential. What a shame this potential didn't shine through.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
4,Not Sure What Galaxy T5-g 5-button is?,"I bought this CD umpteen years ago when it was Recovery Live! and it rocks. If you are a Great White fan this CD is a must have from the early days before Once Bitten, etc."
3,Why?,"The book was good and all, but why does it always have to be the heroine that constantly has to grovel at the hero's feet and ask for a shred of feeling from him? And the hero wouldn't have, exactly, liked the heroine after she returned from Boston if she hadn't turned out to be a good-looking chick. Besides that, the book was a good read."
2,Ouch this one hurt.,"I give Ms. Coffman 2 stars instead of one because first of all she took the time to try to write a love story and secondly she had the basis of a good story. The problem for me is the way she writes. Her characters conversations are so silly. They don't build the characters personalities. As a matter of fact I almost feel embarrassed for them. The whole character developments left me lacking. I also think it is so completely stupid to assume that we are going to fall for a character such as Lizzie, when she is nothing but a smart mouthed brat. Tavis, well now he was just plain and simple a jerk. He never inspired in me anything but comtempt. If Lizzie was portrayed to be so smart, why could she not see Tavis for what he truly was? Yuk! What a very dull story. I only finished it (truly by skipping over half of it) because I hate to start a book and not finish it."
3,good movie bad dvd quality,"I always enjoyed watching this film during the early 1950's.I had an old ingolsorand power drill that looked like the cyclotram. Why is the quality so bad. I have a vrc copy that in much better? They must have made the DVD from the worst copy they could find.During the 1960's and 1970's my brother and I were convinced that hollywood must have burned the original of this film, so I was delighted that a copy showed up. It is a great concept and kind of spooky and depressing, after all, it is dark under the earth, and should not be as cozy as a back lit cave as shown in the 1959 Journey to the Center of the Earth, which is another favority of mine anyway.I only hope that in the future they will remake this with a better original print!!!!! Maybe they did burn the original print!!!"
4,DoH!,"I made a mistake.... bought this and then remembered that I already had a copy of this film - it was one of the movies in the ""100 Movie Pack Sci-Fi Classics"" mega pack. Anyway, this seems to be a slightly better copy of the film, plus the one 'extra"" is a slideshow catalog of movie posters that Alpha Video offers which I found interesting.As several of the other reviewers mentioned, this is a 1950's take on the 'Journey to the Center of the Earth"" story. I like old b/w movies like this, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars."
5,Good Quality Companionship,"In 1987, the author boarded a flight to Damascus to spend three months pursuing a dream as a travel writer. No hotels-and-sightseeing dilettante, he kept extensive notes as he traveled the streets and visited homes and offices in a country that in that year was far more security-conscious than the one he found when he returned in early 2001. He writes candidly, sometimes quoting at too much length, but quickly shows himself to be good company for a reader. His intrepid honesty and sincere desire to illuminate grassroots realities of a nation too often branded with stereotypes are admirable. DD"
3,Before there were blogs....,"Davis' travelogue of his two visits to Syria would have been much more appropriate as an amateur travel blog than a +200 page book. Davis tends to sensationalize the stories of his first visit to Syria in order to create suspense and excitement. Most of his ""captivating"" encounters stem from his inherent and unfounded suspicions of the Syrian police and the fact he does not know a lick of Arabic. Perhaps this review is overly critical, but, in my opinion the genre of privileged Westerners heading off to some ""intimidating"" and ""unknown"" foreign land for a few months and then writing about their experiences has been overdone."
4,"Good cast, great score","Great sound. full, ruch orchestrations. Good actor-singers. Alfred Drake, Lee Venora especially good in recording of Lincoln Center production. Score based on themes of Borodin. Silly story, but some good songs that made the pop charts and had lives outside the context of the show: ""And This Is My Beloved,"" ""Baubles, Bangles and Beads,"" ""Stranger in Paradise,"""
4,The Best Yet,"The gist of this scathing essay is old hat. It is, however, by far the most accurate work on the most arrogant people in the West. Mr. Chesnoff leaves one big fly in his foie gras: If he lives in France strictly for work purposes, well, he should clearly say so. Instead, most of his book is a pityless attack on what, to him, is obviously one big pain in his derriere. He concludes sounding like a real-estate agent, exclaiming what a wonderful life he leads in his idyllic little French village, bantering with the yocals over their anti-Americanism. When one of them asks him why he continues to live in France (American translation: Put up or shut up), he shoots back with the hackneyed response that France has beautiful women and great wine--hardly a professional comeback in vue of this vitriolic essay."
5,"Quick read, insightful",This book was better than I thought it would be. Chesnoff gave me just the right amount of information. I have met Frenchmen in and outside of France. I also know people who have lived in Francophone countries in Africa. This book gives context to things I have learned from these experiences.This book didn't changed my somewhat negative view of the French. But it did help clarify and deepen my knowledge of their society.
1,Ridicule,I always wonder why people write this kind of stupid books. Maybe because they find people even more stupid to buy and read them ...I think that this book's title should be: My unpleasant neighbors - why they can't stand me-and why the feeling is mutual. Chesnoff would at least write on a topic he knows.
1,Hooey,"I just saw this guy on Fox news and reckon this is just about the biggest bunch of hooey I've ever heard. You can sum up his thesis with the following: ""they don't agree with us, therefore they are bad."" Give me a break. Buying into this lowbrow kind of thinking is exactly why an entire nation could possibly not stand us. Please, people...is it too much to ask for us to exercise some critical thinking?"
5,Love this product.,"I'm so sad that these herbal pacs are not available. I have purchased them many times and was hoping to purchase more for this Christmas season. I use the old, no longer smelly one, as a warmer for my bed during the winter months. My husband is using his as a cold pac for a foot injury. They are wonderful."
4,Barbadian Star,"It is a musical blend of the most moving rhythms to ever have been recorded. Her first single is catchy and starts any party going into full swing.Although this is her first album, she has signed with a prestigious record label that takes care of its people. I expect more hits from her in the near future."
1,Another Generic signing by Jay Z,"another Beyonce clone Signed up by Jay Z&it shows.""Pon De Replay"" been played over&over again&again but that song gets on my nerves.after that Her Lite Vocals just don't add anything&the Music here is your standard fare.pretty boring Album."
2,"No originality, just another dance album.","At least this album doesn't have ""Unfaithful"", so it gets 2 stars instead of 1. Seriously though, what house would you want to roll up to, pickin up yo friends listening to this junk? Might as well put Beyonce in, at least she's classy and has a better vocal range on ballads."
5,the first album from this great singers,"right now this is my favorite singers and is her first album, came in a plastic cover and new, and came on time by mail in my place i haven't found this one and i get from amazon, thanks"
3,Not her best!,"I don't know what I expected from her first CD, but this wasn't it. Only one song that I really like on there."
4,Great Debut,"I was just given this cd as a gift today, and I really like it. She's very versatile in the style of her songs, and that is always a great thing. I personally do not think there are any fillers on the cd; well, maybe 1 (the ""Thug"" song), but even THAT song isn't TERRIBLE. She's 17, this is her first cd, and I think it is hot. Some reviewers said that she appears ""unenthused"" when she performs, and has no emotion in her voice when she sings. Give her a minute. She's just getting warmed up. I hope her career soars. Go get the cd. Support Rihanna!"
3,Enjoyable and Fun.,"You would imagine that she would be a one hit wonder. Her first single, ""Pon De Replay"" even samples the handclap that is notorious for leading to one hit wonders. (Must I remind you of Lumidee?) But actually, this CD has some pretty good material.This album has some great songs like ""Here I Go Again"", ""If It's Lovin' That You Want"" and ""Music of the Sun"". Her voice is not the best, but she works with what she's got and produces wonderful harmonizing. There are one or two filler tracks, yes, like ""Willing To Wait"", but this CD has a lot more good material than bad, and is an enjoyable album."
3,talented yet overrated,"she's really beautiful and she could sing, and I respect her for being proud of her carribbean cultural roots and incorporating it into her music. However she sounds like beyonce at times and even looks like her(though much more natural looking than her), and pon de replay, though a good song, was overplayed all over the place just as sean paul's shake that thing was overplayed a couple years ago and he couldn't reclaim that success. I wouldn't be surprised if the same thing happened to rhianna and she became a flash in the pan, but she seems talented and passionate about her music so I hope she continues to release hot dance songs and with her next album, experiment with even more world music with a new image to keep the public interested."
2,Music of the sun,Well I liked a few songs on 'Music of the sun' and as someone from her country of birth I'm glad that she has been able to reach such heady heights.However this cd is a bit really too all over the place..two hip hop songs here...too reggae pieces here..a slow jam over there....Oh and Rihanna if you read this i'd like you to get a lawyer and get that Combermere Concert footage from 2003 (I think) off the air back here in Barbados. I'll be honest and say that you sound really aweful..you look good on stage but you sound terrible.Not dissing YOu intentionaly but just giving you some advice..you dont really want that kinda thing on the air now that you've got image rights and all those kinda things to check for.
3,"Rhianna, Rihanna!!!",So this is who Stevie Nix has been singing about all these years. I'll have to say I'm slightly disappointed.
2,"A Descent album , nothing special","After listing to this album 2 times I have come to the conclusion this artist maybe a ""One hit Wonder"". Nothing really special about this cd some of the beats are on point but not really what I expected to see. Music of the sun however is a intresting title in itself, maybe implying you have to only listin to it during the day for it to sound good. That being said this album should be nothing more then a download, dont waste money. For some real Hip-Hop see Kanye West latest Masterpiece Late Registration."
1,"boring, weak talent, and quite tarty","rihanna is such a tart, she sets a bad example for people, wearing such revealing clothes in her new video. her voice is terrible weak, and she has got no talent, she is just a generic beyonce wannabe, and thats a bad thing, because beyonce is nasty. so if u want a bad influence like this tart, if not, get something like norah jones. ""sunrise sunrise, feels like morning in your eyes"", ""oooh oooh oooh oooh ooh"""
3,just another young girl...,"Rihanna is a cute girl, but there are so many other singers just like her. I don't see much originality in her. She seems like Ciara's little sister who wants to be like her. Her hit Pon de Replay is fun and catchy, but that's all there is to it. If you're expecting more songs like that troughout the album, then you'll be very dissappointed. The other songs are boring."
4,Vintage Rihanna,"I got more into Rihanna with her more recent music; this is definitely from an era before she'd evolved into more dance-driven, bass-heavy music. It really shows her Barbados roots. However, ""Pon de Replay"" has held up well, and her voice is beautiful."
5,Great album,"My Girl loves it, it was a great gift for the holidays, and it came on time, like day before. cool"
3,Turn This Up,"I feel embaressed saying I'm digging her music (she's only 17), but DAMN she's good. The beats are reggae, the singing is R&B, and the attitude is Hip Hop. Great production on the faster tracks like ""Pon De Replay"" (both versions), ""If It's Lovin' That You Want"", ""You Don't Love Me"" and ""Let Me"". Remove the slower songs, like ""Willing to Wait"", and you have a pretty solid debut. I'm looking forward to the follow-up. More dancehall please."
4,Pretty good,"(I'm 16, just didn't want to go through all that registering stuff)It's not as good as I thought it was going to be. I borrowed it from a friend hoping the songs would be like Pon de Replay. Some were, but mainly the ones where another person was featured. I'm not a big fan of slow songs, but hers weren't half bad where I skipped right over them. I listened to almost all of them, and that's good for me because I get SO easily distracted when it comes to music.My absolute favorites are:1. Pon de Replay2. No you don't love me (No, No, No)3. That La, la, la4. Let me5. Rush6. There's a thug in my lifeThe Pon de Replay remix was alright. My favorite remix of the song though, is featuring A.P., but it's innapropriate to put on a non-parental advisory cd. However, this cd is definitely worth buying."
3,Well Balance Effort,"Ok, Rihanna can't really sing that well. Although some would say Mary J. Blige couldn't even sing when she first came out but her material was great and her singing got better over-time. Rihanna is the same the material on this album is very nice. Lot of beautiful songs...the stand out track for me is #10 RUSH, OMG if you got a good stereo system in your car and at home play that. It is so driven and the beat, vocal production, guest rapper it is what a song should be well balance and and enjoyment for your ears listening pleasure. Most of the songs on here are really well balance as well. This album is a good pick up for anyone who enjoys good flow and quality sound. Not so much for the singing but for what she is singing about. Great effort really enjoyable."
5,Niice Liive Album,Mmm dis album is pretty sikk styll..unbelievably sikk...i love it. it worth buyin i ain know why somes r hating. maybe she has 2 crap songz buh its all good
5,Rihannas first album..,This girl came out swinging with her first single Pon De Replay. Her first single is awesome and very dancy. The rest of the album is also quite good aswell. If your looking for a fun dancy album you've come to the right place. Good Cd
2,No replay!,"I bought this on a whim. I liked ""Pon De Replay"" (until it was WAY played out) and thought I would give it a chance. I should have stuck with my gut instincts. It is just not good. She has a decent voice (I don't see how people could possibly compare her voice to Beyonce'.....NO WAY!) but, she was just given crap songs' to record. They all sound so generic especially the island sounding songs. The ONLY other song on here that I like besides ""Pon De Replay"" is ""That La La La"". Other than that leave it on the shelve or do some serious sampling before you purchase it."
4,This Is Hot,"I love this Cd i though i would only love Pon De Replay my favorite tracks are If Love Is What You Want, Rush,That La La la,The Last Time, and You don't love me. Who ever produced this is raw as hell everyone should have this CD"
5,The Best,"I don't know for good or for bad, this book is the best book of all 7 Dark Tower Series. The magical drawing of the three characters of their not so ordinary lives scattered throgh 20 century lead to interesting events that happen along the way, including the romance between Eddie and Sussanna and reconsiliation of Gunsligher and the boy, adventures of Susanna's split personality, meeting of new villans and just explosure of the outside world.This book has become my favorite not only in the collection, but also out of all other Stephen King's works, though I enjoyed ""The Talisman"" and Dark Tower Book III too."
3,"Its OK, but not up to par",I was expecting a little more from this book following The Gunslinger (which was fantastic). The Drawing of the Three should have been combined with The Gunslinger or The Watelands to form one book. The..Three seems to be the 'middle' of a book. It picks up where The Gunslinger leaves off and that's about it. There is no real beginning to the book and no real end. There is not much plot for the story and the small bit of plot that there is is VERY strange. I'm hoping that the Wastelands will tie the first three books together.
4,enjoyed it,I hac a hard time puting the book down the only thing I did not like about the book was that it jumped around a lot
5,-****-,"You can't find a better mix of fantasy and horror than the Dark Tower series. This book flawlessly continues the plot from the first book, The Gunslinger, where it picks up a couple of hours after Roland has ""killed"" Walter, the man in black. Roland, suffering from a life-threating bite (poisonous) from the lobstrosiities, has to bring a coccaine junkie, a schizophrenic woman, and a relentless killer into his world and use their help to reach the tower. In order to do this, he has to, in effect, take over them by commanding what to do through their minds. Occasionally, he has to physically transport himself to their world. Iwon't say anything else; I've probably ruined the surprise for you already. Phil Hale's drawings are a nice touch"
4,DT starts here,"This book was better than the first by a long shot. Here we start to learn about the characters more and about the Dark Tower. Long in parts but well worth the read. Am reading the 3rd in the series now and that one is fantastic, stick with this book and you will be blown away by the next installment!"
4,la,this is a great book not the best of the dark tower books this books main purpos is to introduce the main charecters and thats why this book is not only great but important
5,Another great book from SK,It's a Steven King book...buy it....(that line tells you pretty much everything you need to know)
4,A highly imaginative (and entertaining) work,"The Drawing of The Three is a highly imaginative story, fast-paced, and hence simply un-put-down-able. It cross different world/space/time/characters, and is highly interwovened that it is a story with many good (and surprising) twisted. Unlike the first volume, the Gunslinger, now the Dark Tower plot is getting (a little bit) clear in Stephen King's mind, and hence this volume is much easier to read than the first volume.Nobody can create such a story combining action/fantasy/epic/.....better than Stephen King, and he is a real master."
4,"The Drawing of the Three (The Dark Tower, Book 2)",This is a well written book by a good author. It (he) does a good job following the preset story line that was laided out in the first book. This cohesion is achieved in part by the use of the same reader for the whole series. It will leave you wanting to go onto the third book in the series. Enjoy the listening of this book.
3,Weaker than the first,"I really enjoyed the first book so naturally I picked up a copy of The Drawing. I was a little disappointed with this one. Most of the story seems to take place walking across a beach, during which Roland is sick or nearly dying a majority of the time. And while I enjoyed Eddie as a new addition, I thought that Odetta was too weak of a character and Detta was a little over the top. I suppose that's what King was going for but I just didn't care for it. Regardless I'll give the third book a chance and hopefully King will get back on track with Roland's mission to the Tower."
5,Rmd King,"The Dark Tower series ...WOW! KING has done it again. My Daughter turned me on to tthe Dark Tower series. & I intend to continue reading them through to Dark Tower VII. It's hard not to. You will find yourself wondering through the day what Roland & his ka-tete are doing right now. Again, it's hard not to. Almost as hard to set the book down. Stephen King, you've done it again. A true master."
2,Aaargh,"Growing up, I read every book King wrote in his early career; and loved them all.This is supposedly his ""masterpiece"". Unfortunately, it felt like required reading in high school. Ponderous, difficult, over-bearing and (frankly) boring.This is a visceral, personal reaction. Based on the other reviews, many may like it. I habitually read for pleasure. Books that are relatively easy on the intellect, and this book isn't. I have enough mental challenges in the real world. If you want escapist fiction, this may not be right for you.An analogy; its like being at a business dinner in Asia, eating a delicacy that tastes aweful. All the locals at the table are treasuring the feast, and you're fighting to keep your gurge down."
3,original printing,This copy was old with a musty smell and yellowing pages. No missing or torn pages. Cover is cracked with fading colors but intact and will survive many readings.
3,good book,Ive yet to finish it. I like the series. Nice thing about ebooks is that they are always available to read.
5,The best of the DT series!,"This is by far my favorite book of The Dark Tower series. The f**king imagery throughout this book is incredible (prime example is when Roland enters Eddy's body for the first time on the plane and Roland describes what he sees) and the level of suspense is un-nerving at times (especially at the beginning of the book with the lobstrosities and later during the shoot out where Eddy is naked)This by far the best straight up story telling of all the DT book, and the most original. The character development in this book outshines that of most books i've read. The only thing that sucks about The Drawing of the Three is the fact that the next 5 books of the series are disappointingly not as bad ass. (with maybe the exception of Wizard and Glass)"
4,Fantastic!,"I was really questioning whether to continue after reading the gunslinger, but now I'm glad I did. I couldn't put this one down and I look forward to the third book. I have to be fair and say that some of the wording can be a bit confusing. It may be the effect he was going for with different people and different slang, but I found myself rereading a few paragraphs trying to understand if some things were typos or not."
5,Good Listening!,"I make a lot of car trips and I love Stephen King, so I purchased the whole Gunslinger series. It is a great way to have the miles go by in a very entertaining way! Sometimes, I wished I had more miles to go because I wanted to hear more!"
5,Exceptional!,"I believe this is Stephen King at his best. It picks up right where the amazing 'Gunslinger' leaves off and sets you up perfectly to continue on the journey. There are more characters and they develop wonderfully, making this new installment even fuller in content. If you enjoyed the chapter in 'The Gunslinger' where Roland meets Jake and finds out where Jake came from, then you will love this book. It delves even deeper into this phenomenon and takes you even further into the twisting connections of this universe. The foreshadowing of the challenges ahead and the ultimate goal are still a bit hazy, but they are a perfect tease to keep you racing through to 'The Waste Lands.' If you have not read this book, you should. Start with 'The Gunslinger' and just go."
3,After A Bumpy Start...,"Well at least now I'm hooked. I've read a lot of Stephen King. In fact, the only major hole in my King library is The Dark Tower. After The Gunslinger I didn't know if I'd make it; I probably will now. I can't say I think this is the guy at his best. It still feels like a very young writer attacking Big Ideas Through Horror Literature, but there are more than just a few flashes of excitement that make it all worthwhile. Even though the narrative is a bit . . . um . . . Too Too King-y at times, it's a Red Bull of a book, and goes down fast and hard (that sounds much dirtier than I meant...). So, I'll take a break and come back for Part 3 and just see what happens..."
4,Much better than the first!,"As I was reading this book, I kept thinking to myself, ""Thank goodness this book is so much better!"" ""The Gunslinger"" was just okay for me, and at times, just dragged. But this book moved at a faster pace. There was also humor (names Roland thought or misheard for modern day things) and action (gun shots, fights with lobstrosities). If you were not impressed with ""The Gunslinger"" and was questioning reading the rest of the series, give this book a chance."
3,"Okay, but nothing special","I can't give a glowing review for what I felt was a very mediocre book. The writing was a bit plodding at times, and I only found the plot barely interesting enough to finish the book."
4,Better Than The First,"The Drawing of the Three is the second volume in Stephen King's famous Dark Tower series. The novel is better than the first book in the series, The Gunslinger, mostly because of the rich characters which King intoduces in the novel. Eddie Dean is a fascinating character. Funny and to the point, and by the end of the novel, demanding and hopeless at the same time. Odetta Holmes is one of the better female characters King has created in his time. Even Jack Mort, who is only in the novel for the final three chapters is interesting in his devilish way. The novel consists of many periods of desert and nothing much but talking and thinking from the characters, but that's what makes the book good. We like the characters so much, that they can talk about virtually nothing for ten pages, and we don't even care. Roland, the last gunslinger, continues to fascinate me as he continues his quest to the Dark Tower. I must say, that I am now intersted, and ready for the rest of the journey."
5,I'll never look at a lobster the same again.,"Stephen King's second book in the Dark Tower Series grabs you so fast you will not be able to put it down. Right off the bat, our hero gets seriously hurt by freaky lobsters who continue to wreak havoc throughout the story. Roland somehow pulls himself together long enough to go through a door which is like a time warp and find Eddie Dean. Eddie is the prisoner that was on one of the tarot cards that the man in black foretold of. King was brilliant with the whole Eddie Dean story and the way he worked Roland into Eddies's time and place. Roland will go through two more doors for the drawing of the three and you will find that this gunslinger does have a heart. This is King at his best."
5,A Shock back to the King,"After a rocky start, King pulls you in with my second favorite of the whole series. This book is able to combine the character development and non-stop action needed to become a great thriller. It also left me afraid of Lobstrosities and split personality women. I am afraid that you have to read The Gunslinger to get to this one but you will be thoroughly rewarded."
2,Not King's best...,"I love Stpehen King's books. I like to get first ed, and get them the day the come out. But as for The Dark Tower books so far...UG!The Drawing of the Three is a smidge better then The Gunsliger...but not by much. I found this book to be very dull and the char are thin at best. They have no developement, not like King's other books.This is the story of the last gunslinger (I just love that name :O) ) and how he builds his team in search of The Dark Tower. I found this book to be slow to read...it's like I was walking through mud. The only reason i want to read the seires, is that his next book (The Black House) makes references to this series and I want to keep up with what's going on.I'd say read this book if you want to, but only if you want to."
1,King's at his worst,"I could barely even make it through this book, it was so boring. It just carries on and on. This was by far the worst of the dark tower series so far. I have to say I did enjoy The Gunslinger and The Waste Lands very much. If you want to read a good book like The Waste Lands, then your going to have to make it through this-GOOD LUCK!"
1,Weak,"After a friend highly recommended the Dark Tower series to me, I trudged through The Gunslinger promising myself to keep my expectations low in accordance with the author's plea to look beyond the first book. Unfortunately, I found The Drawing of the Three to be one of the weakest stories I've ever read. I think the best description has already been stated elsewhere in these reviews...dull.I guess this must be one of those series that you either love or hate. For those who enjoy a good fantasy series of the likes of Goodkind, Jordan, Brooks, Feist, Donaldson, and Herbert, I strongly suggest that you look elsewhere. Unlike Roland, the span of time that I wasted reading this book means a lot to me."
1,THE WRONG BOOK!!!,"After finishing the first of the Dark Tower - The Gunslinger, series I was looking forward to receiving the second book, The Drawing of the Three. When I opened the package there it was, but I don't care for dust jackets, so I removed it from the new book. The actual book under the dust jacket was The Song of Susannah, which is the same size as The Drawing of the Three. I am confident that this mistake is the exception, and would appreciate being sent a mailer to return the duplicate book, and receive the correct book. Thank you for you assistance with this matter. Ian McCurdy"
1,best of the worst,"this book had at least a glimmer of hope. by far the best book of the worst king books ever written.boring, stupid. monotinous,waste of time and money. that is the kindest review i can come up with for drawing the three. if you go ahead and continue after this book you must be as desparate as i was for something good to read, you will not find it in the dark tower. you might try the farseer trilogy by robin hobb, now their is a good author. i will never read another king book untill he pays me back the 40 dollars i wasted on th 4 dark tower books."
4,Great,"The Drawing of the Three is the continuing adventures of Roland who is on a quest to find the Dark Tower, a Tower with magical powers. In the second story of the series we find Roland going through time and places to gather the other ""gunslingers"" and a ""gunslinger in training"". One by one all three new characters come across to Roland's plane of existance. A woman, A drug addict, and a boy. To be able to go back were they came from they are forced to join Roland on his journey to Dark Tower to find a way back. Throughout, the story we find a growing respect, friendship, and love between all 4 of the characters as they journey towards the Dark Tower."
3,Deprivation and torture!,"Good basic story from Mr. King, but boy do those people suffer. I suppose I should read the next one."
2,"Stephen King's ""The Drawing Of The Three""","I found this book as compulsive to read as other king novels, but it was lacking in substance. Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed it, but it read like a bad '80's sci-fi movie, and the use of colloquialisms and conversational narration was annoying and at times redundant. As with some of King's other books, he has come up with a great idea but failed to endow it with the story it deserves. Hopefully King will do more justice to the next installment in the series, and redeem Roland in this world.If you want to read a Stephen King novel I suggest one of the greats like ""The Shining"" or ""The Green Mile"". If, however, you are a hardcore King fan, this book would probably appeal to you more than it did to me."
2,Dark Tower leaning,The promising start of the Dark Tower saga in The Gunslinger is aborted in this clunker.
4,More Characters!,The Drawing of the Three is another excellent book in the series. I appreciate that King adds more characters to the story instead of just sticking with the gunslinger. Each character is very well done.
3,Leave Me Hanging,"This book has taken a decline from the first. The first book saw much action and started quite a plot. However, this book took me a few months to read because I would pick it up, read a couple pages, and get bored with it. The whole middle of the book was long winded. There was much that could have been taken out. The concept was great, but there was just a bunch of unnecessary stuff. However, I am still going to trudge threw and try to read them all."
2,The Border Legion.,"It was a bit slow to start but as I got into it, it got better. I like western books but this was very disappointing."
5,Zane Grey Classic,Well developed characters and plot. Delves into the depravity of some men who are not made accountable as well as the workings of the conscience in others.
3,the border legion,It was a very typical Zane Grey book. I enjoyed it as I like his work. I got the impression it was a romance in a western setting.
5,Very informative and enjoyable.,Excellent introduction to some basic priciples of the science volcanology and the to the scientists who work in this field every day. This movie is informative and very well filmed. The material is also presented with a certain sense of tasteful humor.
5,The sensational Gene Harris!,"Gene Harris was one of the greatest jazz pianists of XX century.I think this CD captures some of his best recordings, so thatI would like to give it 10 stars!Listen this CD. Perhaps it is named ""A Little Piece of Heaven"" because Gene is playing now directly from the Heaven for you."
2,Not Hot Or Spicy,"First time this past week trying this brand of injectable marinade and was very dissapointed. The marinade didn't seem to impart any spicy favor at all to the turkey. Extra downside, the marinade made the inside of the turkey a scary red color.Should have stuck with tony's brand."
5,"Sharp, witty, sad","In a myriad of SF-writers, Brian Aldiss has always stood out because of his ability to infuse typical genre scenarios with unique imagination and gentle irony, and The Dark Light Years is the author at his best. The plot follows humanity's first contac with an alien race called the Utods, an intelligent, gentle people who think technology is a strange Idea and socialize using their excrements(!). Aldiss turns this scenario into a humorous but but bleak fable about human nature, with lots of sideways glances at heavy philosophical themes like the nature of communication, religion and progress. A great book, halfway between Ellison and Asimov. Thoroughly recommended."
2,I can't figure it out.,"I don't know , Brian Aldis is a great writer , he wrote masterpieces like ""The Long Afternoon On Earth"" and ""Space , Time And Netaniel"" but this book is just horrible.It's REALLY dated , totaly flat charecters , childish aliens , and the story itself is pretty bad.I like most of his work , and he does have ingenius sparks sometimes , but this book is lame! For some good read of Aldis you should try ""the interpreter"" or ""The Long Afternoon On Earth""."
2,Review,"If you are looking for a book with ideas of ""pueblo style"" or southwestern adobe style homes, this is not it. The cover is misleading, leading you to believe this book contains many if not all, this style. There are only a few (count 3 or 4) plans in the true pueblo style."
2,Still searching for good Southwestern House Plans,"Although the book does have a few Pueblo-style plans like those featured on the front and back cover, very little of the book is devoted to them. Most of the houses it contains are what I would term as fairly traditional, nonsouthwestern houses; their tile roofs seem to be the basis for their inclusion. I have yet to find a good collection or two of southwestern plans. Most of the floor plans were unappealing to me as well."
2,Southwest Home Plans - There must be something better,"It's the best I've found for true SW style homeplans, but many of the plans are not SW -- just houses with tile roofs. They're all 2,000 sq. ft & up, many twice that size, which puts them out of reach for me (too expensive to build)"
3,thorough but wish there were photos,"i like to look through this book and learn, but without photos, i feel i'm constantly going online to see photos of various critters."
4,I know these guys,"Support these guys. i go to church with dan and paul (the guitar and vocals guy from australia, and the drummer respectivly) and they are some of the nicest coolest guys you'll ever meet. I've been down since the T-1 and Slow Down Turbo days and they just keep getting better. Thier EP is also a totaly tubular record. My only gripe is that so many ladies love paul and that dan is such a friggen sexy man. Dont bring a date to one of thier shows because you'l leave alone. I'm not sure about gavin or phil (mainly just because i dont know them personaly) but dan and paul are both amazing musicians. If you ever get the chance to you should see them lead worship, there is just something about these guys that works. Weather its playing to crouds of guys in girl pants and other such emo attire or playing thier cute little hearts out for God, these guys are good. Keep up the good work guys, and ill see ya on sunday."
5,buy this album!!,"Ive been going to see This Providence since February of 2004 and since then theyve grown so much as a band! Their new stuff is amazing!! I find myself listening to it over and over.. if you buy this cd it'll end up staying in your cd player for a long time!!Besids loving all of the tracks, my favorites are track 1 ""Well Versed in the Ways of the World"" and track 6 ""Certain Words in Uncertain Times""so go right now and buy this album!!! :)"
5,Super Pans,"These are the best pans that I have ever owned. Well made, non stick, look great. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a great price for super quality!"
2,Hugely disappointed..,"The cookware is a good set, and the pans are beautifully designed and cook well, however this set does not contain a 3qt saucepan or a steamer..ridiculous for the price I paid for it. Not having a 3qt saucepan means I cannot cook large quantities of pasta..I have searched all over the internet to get the missing 3 qt saucepan and every website I go to says the item is no longer available or out of stock. I feel like just throwing the whole thing in the rubbish and buying another set with the full saucepan set and steamer. It's a pity because it is a really nice design, Circulon what are you thinking making sets like this?? Unfortunately as I've never bought cookware before, I somehow didn't notice/realise it did not contain the large saucepan. Very very annoyed..."
4,Great cookware at a great price.,"TheCirculon Elite Hard Anodized Nonstick 10-Piece Cookware Setwas just as I expected. I like the dark finish, as stainless gets grungy and stained quickly. The pans are not overly heavy, but solid, and hold the heat well. Shipping was free, and I got my set within a week of ordering it. That's remarkable - because I live on an island in Alaska, and we rely on Internet shopping and mail order. There are often extra costs tacked on for shipping & handling, or companies simply ""don't ship to Alaska""."
1,Not as described,"After reading all of the reviews, I was so anxious and happy to hear the UPS truck pull up tonight, knowing that it would be my Circulon cookware being delivered. After unpacking the cookware, the 1st thing I noticed was the label on the frying pan, stating that the pans were coated with Dupont's Autograph Nonstick coating...Nowhere in the description of this product on Amazon's site did it say that there was a Dupont nonstick coating on this cookware!While researching the ""anodizing"" process, I was led to believe that the metal was hardened and ""that"" was what made it nonstick, not a chemical coating from Dupont's Teflon family.If Amazon had properly described this product as having the Dupont Autograph Coating, I would not have bought it in the first place. That is why I am returning it and the return shipping cost should be paid by Amazon as well as correcting the description of this product for others who are Teflon/chemically sensitive and save them this same disappointment!"
5,SO GREAT I BOUGHT A 2ND SET FOR OUR MOTORHOME!,"I was first introduced to Circulon cookware when I had to replace the 8 qt. stockpot from my ""professional cookware set"" I had purchased from a home and garden show. The non-stick inside of my existing stockpot was peeling. I liked the looks of the Circulon and since have bought the 10 piece ""Elite"" at an after Christmas Retail Sale. I rave about this cookware to everyone. I am from Louisiana and love to cook and this makes cooking even more fun!Last year when we became motorhome owners, the only cookware I would consider was a another set of Circulon Elite! After looking at what the retail sales had to offer, I decided to check out my old reliable AMAZON and as always found exactly what I needed at a much better price! AMAZON ROCKS!You will not be disappointed in any circulon product or AMAZON. I also purchased the 14 inch stir fry pan and use it at least weekly! It is fantastic for one dish meals!"
2,5 years in...,"Amazon states I bought these pans on Sept 21, 2006, so I can assume I started using them shortly thereafter. I am now looking for new cookware, which should give you an idea of how durable these are. We eat out often too. So these may have been used an average of 2-3 times a week?The ridges in the pans/pots don't get clean. At the bottom of my pan, the ridges are brown. I can't get them clean. In both of my pots, the non-stick is pealing. The only thing still going about this set are the lids. Nothing wrong with the lids...oh, except the rubber slides on one lid.So, I'm not impressed."
3,"Bit flimsy, but good value for the money","These pans are a bit thinner than I expected, but that is probably not a surprise, given the value price."
5,Great product!,"I love them! They're really easy to clean and make cooking a breeze! Plus, I heard that they offer lifetime warrenty!"
5,Finally I've got a full set.,I've owned the wok and 5 !/2qt. pasta pot for years and found I use them a lot. I also ordered the 12 saute pan and 3qt sauce pan.I now have a real nice set I hope will last forever.They are so easy to clean and I hope this set works like the Elite pots and pans I have already.I'm sure they will.No more scrubbing to keep my old stainless steel pans looking good. Thanks Amazon for the super fast shipping.
5,"Great Product, Incredible Price",This product is great and the price offered is unbeatable. i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new set of cookware
4,Excellent Training Material but a Misleading Title,"Provides excellent professional level training in the fundamentals. Lakers as coaches lend credibility to the material. However, the title Fast Break is misleading. A coach seeking fast break plays Lakers style to incorporate into his or her practice regimen will be disappointed."
4,memories,"This re-release brings back alot of great early 80's memories. Sheenas' vocals soar on this cd. This fans' favorites - ""telephone lines"", ""not worth the hurt"", a little tenderness"", ""you could have been with me"", & ""when he shines"". Next vh-1 divas should include Sheena & Olivia Newton-John. Anyone listening?"
4,INTRIGUING - GREAT PLOT,"Intriguing story line. A CIA assassin, (Brown) decides that he has had enough and backs out on his last hit. He gets involved with the daughter of his target.However, being able to retire from the agency is a little more difficult than he imagines with surprising consequences. Brown is, as usual, very good as Michael Grant.Beautiful scenery, set in the hills of New Mexico.When is the sequel????"
4,The Pentagon - It's More Mundane Than You Thought,"This delightful book imparts great technical and historical data while simultaneously giving your sense of humor a terrific workout. The big, beleaguered building comes alive with purpose and structure thanks to the well-written and thoroughly researched text. Suddenly the geometric monster fits neatly into the tapestry of American foreign policy and the reader is given a window onto the foibles and passions of the thousands of citizens who enter the monolith each day. I highly recommend this fascinating book to anyone who has ever wondered about the importance of the Pentagon, and the impact of the strategies that emanate from it."
5,Love Kliban,I love the B Kliban series. Didn't think i would find these after they died in my house in a flood. Great Quality
4,Never ceases to amuse....,I fell in love with Kilban's absurd humor back in the 1970's and still find it fresh after all these years. I gave this copy as a gift and it was well received.
2,Great book for people with a demented sort of humor..,"Well, actually not that great. Go with The Far Side or Calvin & Hobbes or Anything Else before you go with this book.The titlees are hard to read, the art is OK to say the most, and the humor is horrible... Don't waste your money.."
4,The Beauty of the Marsh,"Not many people can write this kind of book - it's about Tony Florio's love affair with the marsh. He lived his life on the Delaware marsh,worked there, brought his wife there, raised his children there (if you want to find out how to get your kids away from the screen and into nature this is the book for you)and met all kinds of unforgetable characters there - including the furry and feathered kind. He worked as a biologist for the state's wildlife agency for 38 years, and lived 32 of those years in a remote area of Delaware's marshland - a place unspoiled by the relentless development of today. Read this book, find out what a ""progger"" is, and what life was like in an earlier era in Delaware's beautiful and unpredictable marsh.Beth ShockleyEditor, Outdoor Delaware magazine"
2,craptastic platic,Understand this is a plastic filter that will negate the image quality of any decent lens. I use this as a last resort for images that will be converted to black and white.Color-shift of the plastic is too dramatic for its use in my color capture.For the price... eh... whatever.
2,Very Disappointing,"I borrowed a Roto-Zip on one or more occasions and I liked it. I was very happy when I received one as a gift. I was very disappointed though when I used the cut-off attachment and I could not get the cut-off wheel off! The lock down button went in, but could not keep the unit from spinning. The plastic had parted to the side. Now I will have to go through the aggravation of getting it repaired, or even better, sending it back. Thanks for wasting my time ROTO-ZIP! I'll stick to my angle grinder."
4,Good but...,These were tasty and the only reason I bought them was because they were on sale for 11.88. This made them a reasonable price per bar. Otherwise in my opinion they are too expensive. Also I believe they were offering a super saver on shipping and I combined it with other items so I didn't pay any shipping.They are gluten free and at least this flavor had good taste. Always a nice bonus with something healthy. They are a little high in carbs for one serving but they are all natural. They did seem to take a bit longer to arrive then other things I've ordered.
5,Very tasty,"Of all the kind bars I've tried, this is my favorite. Nice big chunks of macadamia nuts, very yummy."
3,Not That Great,"This also-ran bar is fulfilling at best. Tastier bars have been made using the same horrifying fat content. Instead of concentrating the fat in the nuts, most of the fat is used to hold the sticky bar together, leaving you feeling greasy after. Greasy, mediocre taste, high fat content... you're better off just sending a direct donation to OneVoice, because the consequences of consuming this bar just aren't worth it."
5,Wonderful,"I can't say enough good about this book. If you enjoy reading romance, you'll love In the Midnight Rain. Ruth Wind has written a compelling story about two wounded people who come to terms with their losses, their pasts and each other. This books is wonderful and I can't wait for Ms. Wind's next one. I loved every word."
5,A Must Read!!,"In the Midnight Rain transported me to the south to a beautiful land and beautiful blues music. This is a very, very good love story with a mystery to boot. This is a book I will definitely reread in the years to come. 5+ stars!!!! Happy reading everybody."
3,Wonderful,This was a wonderful love story. With a little mystery in it. Nice weekend book if you're traveling or just want a short little summer book to read.
4,"Easy, relaxing read",The characters were interesting and just different enough from other similar books to keep your attention. The several back stories and connecting them to the present and not really knowing where exactly it all fit in kept me reading way too late many nights!
4,Okay,I might re-read. Maybe just not too exciting. I wouldn't buy it again though. Just too bland and I like more excitement!
4,Surprised...,"While browsing the ""free"" books, this was #1 on the list...I didn't read any reviews prior to my purchase, something I've never done before.I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! From the very beginning, I was reading every line...that is the biggest compliment I can give any author! There are not many books that I read where I don't skim paragraphs, so when I say I read every line, that's big.Although predictable in many ways, I like the characters, story development and the story was laid out well enough and I can easily see this becoming a made-for-TV movie.I'm glad I have been introduced to this author....very talented story teller!"
4,So much more than a romance,"This book was great. I little intrigue, a great plot, but also really wonderful characters. Some of it is a little far fetched but I thought it was really great."
3,thanks,enjoying my products apps are working good and neck scarf is soft and pretty. Book for my kindle was ok
1,Couldn't get into it!,I only got through a few chapters and I could not get into this book. It started way to slow and I couldn't stick with it. I actually did not finish this and erased from my kindle device completely. Did not enjoy it!
3,more romance than mystery,While I enjoyed parts of this book it started as a slow read and to much of the book was based on sex and sexual innuendo. If you are looking for a clean read as I was then this book definetly isn't for you.
4,Mystery wrapped in romance,"The blending of romance and mystery in this book reminds me to some extent of some of the Nora Roberts romance/mystery books I've liked. I am more of a mystery reader so some of the romance elements were a bit more than I'd have preferred, especially the finale of the romance. However, the writing was lush and lyrical, giving a wonderful feel of place and the mystery plot was interesting and given a number of unexpected twists along the storyline.The characters were well done, not just the lead characters and supporting characters, but many of the minor characters as well. Nostalgic, as befits a biographer researching the life of a blues singer from 40 years ago, with an excellent feel of both the place and the time.This was a nice change of pace read for me and I would certainly try other books by this author."
5,Loved the story and the author's writing style,"This story was completely capitvating. I loved the setting and I loved Blue's southern drawl and endearments so associated with the deep south. I could see him and feel his depth of emotion. The characters in this book were so well defined and easily seen in the mind's eye. This is a very fine author. Someone who reads lot of books just knows when an author is special and Barbara Samuel is special. Her ability to describe the seen and the emotion of the characters involved, well about perfect. I will be rearding her again, her words draw the reader into the story and keep you there to the finish."
3,In the midnight rain,"I enjoyed the story line, romance with some mystery mixed in which kept me reading. It just seemed to end abruptly and unexpected since my Kindle said I was only 75% done. I would recommend this book if you are looking for a quick read with romance and steamy love scenes."
4,Held my interest throughout,The characters immediately caught my interest. It is stories within a story. The author was able to keep the endings of the stories a mystery until the end. An enjoyable read.
1,Worst book,This is not what I would call a mystery. I skipped more pages than I read. Not interested in details of seduction and all the description of their love? life. The mystery part takes 10th place in this book. I bought it based on reviews where no one said it was a romance novel. Great mystery definitely not. Will not get any more books by this author. Please reviewers say it as it is.
2,too political and impossible dates,"The book has impossible timing,these people are suppose to remember 1968 and still be in their thirties chatting online in music forums??? Then the author has to throw in her politics, claiming Republicans aren't real people etc... So tired of liberals never letting entertainment be about entertainment and not about pushing their impossible champagne socialism. The Characters are all the same, bland, and not realistic, the plot is obvious, though she does write well, her story is not thought out."
4,This book is written from experience not research,"My husband and I are some of the many who have come to enjoy Vegas as a quick getaway. We both really enjoy places with stories to tell, and many have been told about Vegas. This book is the author's recollections of Vegas from the early 50's to the early 90's and the changes he experienced. I commend him on keeping the stories to what he had first-hand knowledge of and not elaborating by filling in with what those of us who've read on Vegas before, already know. It's interesting to get different perspectives on the good old yarns."
1,No taste,I wanted to try the BreathRX mints. So I did. Cost me more in shippingthan the product cost. And ended up they don't have a good taste or a taste at all. Will stick with the mints I already have.DS in Castro Valley
3,Hmm...what exactly did I just read?,"This book is totally different than what I was expecting. I was expecting a true crime recollection from an actual childhood murderer. What I got was a wild, drug-influenced, sex and murder-filled wall of words. It is simply the oddest book I have ever read. I'm not saying the book was horrible, and I feel privileged to have read it for some reason, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you happen to be actively seeking it out, then you will read it regardless."
5,Clic Readers,The Clic Readers work well. My husband likes how they are always there when you need them. Great experience with the vendor.
3,click glasses,Not as functional as i thought they'd be. Can't put them in a case to protect them. Can't wear them in bed very well. Just my opinion.
1,NEVER RECEIVED,ORDERED FROM AMAZON BUT NEVER RECEIVED THEM .OUT $ 57.00 I WANT BE ORDERING FROM AMAZON AGAIN.
3,Spectacles for the nerd in all of us,"Don't expect pretty. These specs aren't that, not by a long shot.You can probably expect your spouse to turn up her (or his) nose once you put them on. Mine did. And I knew what she was thinking: tacky.But they are neat in a nerdy sort of way. You'd have to be psychotic to lose them, which is helpful for space cadets like me. And when you pull them apart at the bridge, small children think you are magical.One thing, though. If the size of your head rivals a pumpkin like mine does, these specs will be a tight fit."
3,Pretty Color but doesn't do for reading in bed,"I bought the glasses hoping that I would be able to use them after some upcoming surgery. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that instead of being pliable similar to many string arrangements for hanging glasses off one's neck, these are rigid. Consequently, when I tried to use them in bed the rigid ""string"" meant that the glasses were several inches away from my eyes and unusable when I'm lying down.These glasses are fine for daytime activities, but they won't do for reading in bed, reading at the beach, or similar situations."
4,hairy problem,"These glasses are a great idea. However, they do not work with long hair. The back ""strap"" of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose (so you can see over them for distance). Long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back, making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes. I guess most people who need reading glasses don't have long hair?"
3,Not as useful as I'd hoped,"I've had these for six months, and have concluded I don't like them. They don't lay flat against my head if reading in bed, and yes, I know the sides expand. The most irritating factor is the magnets pinch the skin right above the bridge. Save your money. Yes, it's a novelty, but there are much better solutions out there."
3,clicks,The concept of the clics reading glasses is great!! The only problem is that they are designed for someone with a large head. I bought them for my partner for Christmas and they are not adjustable enough to fit his head!!
4,Cool and Handy,"I first saw this type on the CSI New York TV show. I thought they were a very cool idea, but didn't know where to look for them. When I found them here, I decided to try them. I admit the stiff back (not like the flexible string type) took a little getting used to. But once you do, I don't think you'll want to go without. I use mine at work for computer, reading and close up work. When I don't need them, they just hang on my neck, and I can flip back the lens section so they don't click together. I don't ever forget where they are, but sometimes forget to take them off before going home. They are so light you can forget they are hanging there. I would recommend this style of reading glasses, and if you purchase a pair, be warned you will get a lot of comments and questions from the people around you!"
2,clic too small,"Clic glasses good in some aspects but for people with a little larger head the adjustable frames could use about an inch more, they are too tight on the head. People with a lot of hair or thick hair will experience the same problem, will not order any more until they adjust properly"
2,Beware...,"I wear a 7 3/8 hat and these will not fit, not even close. Seems that the manufacturer makes a ""long"" model also and recommend that is what I need. FYI"
2,Small,These are too small for my head. I don't know if they make a larger size but these things are too small. Yes these do adjust but they just do not adjust enough to fit me. So for kids or small heads they should work fine but since they do not fit me and no size options are offered.... I have to give them a poor review.
5,clic adjustable readers,these glasses are great had them for a long time about a year . use them a lot great when ya have to take them off a lot just pull apart an drop around neck . people while out ask about them an a lot wont them great product
3,Returned it after a few days,Had to get the XXL version and my head is not that big so .... YOu may need to consider that if you order.
4,Good for me and a conversation starter,"As some have said, the glasses are a little tight for someone like me with a melon head, but they are still usable (and I do have a very large head). The lenses are very good and provide a sharp view which is sometimes a problem with some store-bought glasses. The blue color of the pair I bought is striking without being overbearing and have generated multiple comments from even random passersby. I also found them to be very sturdy when I have gotten them caught on a bag strap I was removing from over my head. Sturdy, good-looking and good value. The only reason I don't give five stars is for the tight fit, which is partially my fault because of my oversize genes, but the company should have taken that into account. Otherwise, I recommend whole-heartedly."
5,Best reading glasses I've found,These are easy to wear-almost invisible (clear version) and work very well in all situations. The lenses are interchangable SO I order one pair in each magnification I need (1.25 and 1.75) and switch the lenses. PERFECT!People ask me about them all the time. The tinted version is great for the beach and the computer screen.I should bring extra pairs on my sales trips and make a few extra bucks. Buy these! You'll love them.
2,No Long-Haired Wearers,"I have hair to the nape of my neck and when I wear these glasses, ithey either compress my hair and I look goofy, or if I tuck the arms under my hair, it sticks up and I look goofier. These are great in theory, but they are probably best for those who have short hair or are bald."
1,Not for those with hair,I bought 2 pair of these and returned both. Cool looking but not on. They don't work with long hair- duh. And my husband's head is too big.
2,Clic reading glasses,"I have 2 pairs of these type of reading glasses but I never thought I would have to return a pair. I got a pair for my husband and they fit too snug. I never thought to check his size before I ordered them.If they can make a size wider they would be a perfect fit. Otherwise they are great.CliC Adjustable Front Connect Reader, 1.50 Strength, Tortoise Frame"
3,size matters,"I loved the look and operation of these reading glasses. However, I find the normal size is quite tight on the temples and side of the face. This is probably ok for most women. I notice that on the clic website, they have a long version for men. Hopefully this size is wider as well. I could not find this size available on this site."
3,Very cheaply made,"I could not belive how cheaply made this coat was. The coat fabric is very light and does not offer any protection from rain or wind,... I returned the coat"
4,The real reason to buy the CD,"Take nothing away from ""Nowhere Fast"", but the real and true reason to pick up this CD is for the 2 songs by The Blasters. ""One Bad Stud"" is one of my favorite songs and while I don't know too much about the band what I have found out is that it appears that this might be the only way to get this song. I might not know everything about The Blasters but I know I love that song. Damn fine song!!!"
4,good sound for a good movie,"Not enough appreciated by the public, still one hot action movie of the '80s."
5,An unknown classic...,"Streets of Fire is one of those movies where the movie itself may be mediocre, but the soundtrack is incredible. Fire Inc's ""Nowhere Fast"" and ""Tonight is What It Means To Be Young"" are classic examples of 80's rock and ""One Bad Stud"" is a great combination of rockabilly and swing.One thing that is notable about Streets of Fire is the debt that many Japanese animation fans owe it... Streets of Fire (and it's soundtrack) were the inspiration for the anime classic _Bubblegum Crisis_."
5,Cheesy 80's music but I love it,Highlights the Meatloaf-esque (unsurprising as written and produced by Jim Steinman) Nowhere Fast and Tonight is What it Means to be Young. Also the Stevie Nicks penned Sorcerer amd Dan Hartman's I Can Dream About You. The movie was crap but the soundtrack is great.
2,"""Sorcerer"" track is a real disapointment.....","The ""Sorcerer"" track on this CD is nothing like the movie rendition. Completely different singer, different altogether and not even close. If that was one of your favorite moments in the movie and you want to capture it again, do not buy this CD. I rate the CD a 2 only because everything else on this CD seemed to be true to the movie's music. A bummer for me."
4,Streets of fire rocks!!,"When I saw the movie 'Streets of fire,' I didn't like the story as much as the music...the music is AWSOME!! This stuff (especially the songs performed by Fire Inc.) is really good!! Certainly worth the money if you like good rock music!!"
4,Awesome!!!,"Who is Fire Inc.? They are awesome!!! And who doesn't love Dan Hartman's ""I Can Dream About You?"" This sountrack has doo wop, rock, bluesy type songs. It's complete. And the movie isn't bad either!"
5,Cool!,"What can I say. It got here fast, works like it should and I have no complaints. I love this album. Awesome!"
4,"Eclectic Songs, Good Soundtrack","This is an old iconic rock CD. If you're into the campy film, great. The sound track is better than the movie."
3,A blast from the past.,"Loved this movie and the music as a young teenager. Pure 'guilty pleasure' buy. If you remember it, you should pick up the DVD and CD, though it would be really damn nice if Amazon would add the movie to the Prime catalog."
4,Great Old Fashioned Fun,"Michael Pare & Willem Dafoe really bring back the old days with their hero versus villain story. Each time that I watch this movie, I am captured by the music as time passes quickly as I am on the edge of my seat awaiting the next move."
5,A lost Steinman is gold!,"Some people have knocked this mix of soundtrack of the movie, but being a Jim Steinman fan, I still love the disc. OK, some of the 80's electronic sound is too pop and click for my taste anymore, but the Steiny compositions are masterfully delivered and as symphonic as pop music can get: the kind of stuff that can send chills up a spine. My CD came by way of the UK import; if you can nail it here at these prices, man, why wait? Tonight is what it means to be young..."
3,streets of fire,"I loved the movie, but was disappointed when they did'nt use Stoney and the guys on the bus for ""Countdown To Love"" on the CD.Where can I find out who the members of Fire Inc. are? Nowhere Fast and TIWIMTBY are the Bomb ! I give the movie ""5 stars"" but the CD ""3 stars"" because I felt cheated that ""Countdown To Love"" was not even close to being as good as it was in the movie."
5,Why wasn't Springsteen on this?,"He even has a song called ""Streets of Fire""Telling me they couldn't pay the rights? Should be the theme song during the opening credit sceneI really like the wide range of songs on the album, just wish the Boss had made it"
2,"Yeah, but without Diane Lane . . .",". . . moving around in that red dress, it doesn't quite make it. Seriously the two ""Fire"" songs are quite good. The last song is your basic rock and roll anthem, big wall of sound, and really great vocals (not Lane of course, but she lip syncs with the best of 'em). It's all very dated now."
1,NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER,"I never received this order. When I contacted the store to request tracking info, I was informed that it was sent via the USPS and did not have a tracking number. I was also told that I had to give it at least 21 days to deliver? I could have sworn when it was purchased, I was told 7-10 days. The store who sold it did not appear at all to be concerned that I did not receive what was purchased. Subsequently, they never responded to my request for a refund. I'm very dissapointed woth this companyh nad have quit using Amazon as a result."
5,First review incorrect,"The first reviewer stated that he could not regulate the clutch on this driver and that the clicking was kind of loud - um, it's an impact driver - that's how they work, it's not a clutch that ratchets, that is the impact mechanism working - that's why there is twice the torque in an impact driver as in a standard driver-drill... This impact driver is stronger than almost all other brands, and actually is not as loud as most other brands."
5,Very good product,The impact driver charges fast and lasts a long time on each charge. Does everything I wanted it to do very well.
1,A promo rip-off,"I was really disappointed with this book. It has none of the scripts or sample marketing materials promised. Klein wants to sell you a bunch of his other items: seminar kits, tapes, brochures to hand out, etc...all listed in his ""appendix"". The info given is so general it is of little use...you would have to spend money on his other items to really find out anything. Don't buy this if you are looking for a real guide to marketing to senior citizens...is is not here !!"
5,Marketing Financial Servises to Seniors,Although I've been working with seniors for the last 10 plus years I haven't focused my marketing efforts on them. After reading Larry's book I'm going to make the senior market my primary focus and I'm putting together a comprehensive marketing plan based on Larry's recommendations.
5,Heavenly Voice!,I love the music and I love his voice. The best Arab singer and very good looking as well!
1,shameful quality,"I cannot express my extreme disappointment in this set. DO NOT SPEND THE MONEY ON IT. It is simply not worth it. The picture quality is horrendous, most episodes are not viewable at all. I felt like I'd gotten conned. Pick up some of the other less expensive discs and you'll be much happier. One note however, it seems to be a common thread that the earlier episodes have not translated well to dvd, so be careful and read the reviews."
2,Classis East Side Kids move.,"This is in reference to the Alpha Video version.This is a classic east side kid's move where the kids help out the poor little rich boy who gets himself in a jamb. If you like the East side kids, like I do, you'll like this movie. The DVD and sound quality are terrible. You can barely see the picture at some points and the sound is scratchy to say the least. It appears it was just copied from the old films. I guess you can't expect too much for the price. There is a re-mastered copy of this video by Digiview Productions so make sure you buy that version. I haven't seen it yet but it has to be better than this one."
5,"Future D.J. Keep those records spinning, oh yeah!!!","ok, most people don't understand this group, but they were great during their time.(1976-79) They combined the big band sound of the 1940's with disco. The sounds is that of happier times and the stories of their music are wonderful. Ms. Cory Daye had such a wonderful, clear and distinct voice. She was just absoulutely wonderful. This is part of our musical history to never be repeated again."
5,Distinctive Jazz Sound for the AGES!!,"Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band has been a marquee to the hip-hop community. Thanks to them for blessing artist like Ghostfact Killah of Wu Tang Clan with the nice samples. My favorite peice is ""Sunshowers"". The originality of the sound effects were on point. Not to mention the timing with the instruments in how they conjoin together."
4,An oldy but a goody,"I grew up with this stuff, and still love to hear it today, it is still just as good, creating that big band sound was an inspiration, I only wish I could have seen them perform etc in NYC. So many younger friends who have never even heard of the band are always so impressed!!"
5,"""Transistor Madness!""","I'd waited for years before this collection came out! I always liked ""Cherchez La Femme,"" but the song that grabbed my attention was ""Transistor Madness!"" When I heard that song the first time, I made up my mind to go to ""Big Ben's Records and Tapes"" to get my copy. Man, that was 28 years ago, where does the time go! Their writing, musicianship and performing were top notch. The Big Band sound juxtapose to Disco and Latin sounds were fresh and definitely different. To put it simply, they had skills to pay those bills! Folks, the price is right, get a copy and see what those of us who know are talking about! My rating: A solid FIVE STARS for the Very Best of Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band!!!"
4,MAMBO DOWN MEMORY LANE,wE REALLY ENJOYED BEING ABLE TO ONCE AGAIN EXPERIENCE THE SONGS WE LOVED ALL ON ONE CD.
4,Pleasant surprise,"I brought this album strictly for the track ""Cherchez la Femme/Se Si Bon."" I was happy to find a few other good songs I liked on the album."
3,Celtic Tree Signs,"This is a good enough book for what it is - the description of Celtic Tree signs and the characteristics of the trees themselves! However, I had hoped more for folklore or customs surrounding the trees - something that connected the trees to the people of certain birth signs, locations, ages (such as the middle ages) and how they impacted (if they did) daily life.So if you are looking for medicinal uses, superstitions, historical theories, in short how these tree calendar/signs impacted a culture, it doesn't really fit the bill in my opinion."
4,Swinging Christmas,"While Phil Driscoll may not be a household name, this is one CD that should be in EVERY house!The CD is a tad heavy on the vocals for my taste, but Phil's voice/style makes the wait for the trumpet solos enjoyable.For anyone who enjoys GREAT Christmas music and/or for someone who seeks a sample of Phil Driscoll's talent without buying a ""religious"" CD.. this is it!Track after track of traditional Christmas songs sung and played by Phil in a Big Band format."
1,Crap,"I bought these for my 17 month old. They fit him perfectly. Due to the fact that they aer listed as ""snow boots"" I naturally assumed that they would be good for outside, in the snow. Way off.... He wore them in the snow once. He also had snow pants on. The shoes were soaked right through to his socks. Paying upwards of $30 for a pair of shoes that are mis-advertised as ""snow boots"" is ridiculous. List them for what they are - cold weather slippers!Since I already wrote his name on the back of them (day care child) I can't return them! I could not be more irritated!"
4,cute Winter boot,I bought these for my nephew who is 14 months old. The Med. size fits him perfectly. They are warm and furry on the inside keeping his little feet warm in the Winter. They are pretty stylish I must say...he has gotten lots of compliments on them.Only negative thing is that when the bottom of these boots get wet they become very slippery (on hardwood floors). Little ones just learning to walk may end up taking a spill...
5,Historical Account,"This book has made a profound impact on my life and has been an inspiration to our entire household. I began reading it aloud to my 9 year old daughter, and I was moved to research this extraordinary tale. This is the classic account of events that led to the formation of the British and Foreign Bible Society (now Bible Society) in 1804. It paints a picture of the life and times of Mary Jones and her burning desire to read and know the Word of God. Her inspiring story has been reprinted many times, but was originally written by Mary E. Ropes in 1882. This is a humbling story that needs to be told. May there be a revival in our day to treasure the Ancient, Living Word of God."
2,Inspiring story but poorly written,"I read this to my 11yo son and 13yo daughter as part of the SonLight Curriculum. The story is inspiring, no doubt, and educates the reader on the value of the Bible. In our Bible saturated society we are too flippant in that lesson. Since my kids are not extra-ordinary like Mary (rather ordinary) and content to sit through a 2 hour sermon, they had a hard time empathizing with her. As stated in a previous review, the author tends to lose the reader with rabbit trails that feel endless and meaningless about other characters. I hope a more imaginatve author takes this inpiring true story and weaves it into a fictional historical novel thereby spreading the word about Mary, the need to value God's word and proving that christains CAN write good books."
1,Never use one word when you can add 10.,I read as far as page 574 (of 974) and would have given up a lot sooner if I wasn't reading it for a bookgroup discussion. The concepts and plot of this book would be interesting but the writing style made me nauseous. There is just too much unnecessary detail and irrelevant addition to make it interesting. It also makes it confusing and interferes with the main themes and plot.It would be a good exercise for someone learning English to take parts of this book and summarize them down into less words. (If someone did that with the whole book it might be an enjoyable read.)This was my first attempt at reading Dostoevsky and probably my last.
5,Makes some pointed observations about genetics,"The future of the human race and its probes into genetics is considered in The Impact Of The Gene, a title that deftly blends the history of genetic research with an informative discussion of future trends of geneticbased technologies. From the initial establishment of genetics as a science by a 19th century friar to latest advancements by genetics which have affected everyday life, The Impact Of The Gene makes some pointed observations about genetics and its influence on our world."
4,"Funny, intelligent and a great read","Important message and achingly funny too. Ben hammers you with his assault on multi-national companies, California neurosis andmass consumerism.Makes you think and laugh at the same time. I actually laughed out loud with the thought of the ""Hitler trial"" thanks to DNA which was suspended due to a fight on TV rights. I was on a train at the time which is very embarrassing."
4,Satirical view of consumerism and the cure for it all.,"Elton continues on his theme of the past decade pounding all who deserve it (and some who don't) with satirical wit that is difficult to find these days. Master of pun and riposte, Ben Elton gives us all a bit to contemplate when we just have to have that new car, island, or national forest. Not quite as hilarious as Stark, but well worth the read"
3,Socially satirical,"Another environmental theme ,as in 'Stark', also dominates this book -giving it the base for its satire. Business is taking over playing ratings games over environmental terrorism v's self-preservation. Elton takes the mickey out of society for its loss independant thought and the way we rely on others to make decisions for us( even if it is against our better judgement ). Ultimately it is the people who make their own choices and not to be led astray by media who suceed in this novel. Its a tricky an interesting situation in which one hopes if in the same siutation would make the better judgement. It's very light hearted and fun , with comical side tracking."
2,Perhaps he should stick to television.,"Stark was excellent and Gridlock was good. This is poor. Nothing is compelling about this book. No surprises, not a very good story line, not inspiring, it's not even funny! If you don't buy one Ben Elton book, don't buy this one."
3,Guide to X-files Rerun Watcher,"UFO Hunters Handbook is a book for kids. It is written in a sarcastic teacherlike way. If you have a kid that is a UFO buff, than this is a right book to encourage his passion. But if you are older than 12, than you will have to pass it.Caroline Tiger used many sources for this book and most of them are movies like Close Encounter of the Firs Kind and E.T.It is a guide to someone who newer heard of UFO's and extraterrestrials or for someone who just started watching a rerun of X-files for the first time.I expected more of it."
3,Good overview of Alexandria,"Short book that covers four eras of the history of Alexanfria-Greek, Roman, Christian, Muslim through today. Brief, not much detail or analysis, but a good overview."
3,Fair information,"Book okay for tourists who look straight ahead at all times and only see the monuments. I saw the less traveled streets, the people, and the real Egypt."
2,Not Enough Information,"It's clearly written and is clearly aimed at the novice. I'd advise people to see how much they can learn from the program help rather than spend the money on this one. You'll probably need a book but you'll need one that's more comprehensive.In spite of its actual length, the book seems like it's 20 pages long. It's a friendly, very basic, intro to Access. Unfortunately it's going to leave a lot of beginners hanging when they encounter the myriad real world situations the book doesn't cover. I would not advise buying this book without a reference manual to go with it. Example: I wanted to know the syntax for quoting character strings in comparisons. Nothing. In fact all of the comparison and selection by value examples in the book use numbers or dates."
1,Not what I had expected,"This book leaves alot to be desired. Cover to cover, It seemed way too brief. I felt like I was being coached through a few topics that could be figured out by just playing around with the program. Im confused as to why the authors felt it necessary to sacrifice so many trees in order to offer a step by step walk-through of how to use the program's various wizard modes. It seems to me that anyone could open up access and walk themselves through the wizard without reading any of this book. The other 25%-35% of the book that does cover the design view is way to0 brief to be of any use. You barely get a taste of what's out there. Basically you feel like your still.... searching for the ""Missing"" information."
5,That honey on the cover says a lot about the rec - er - CD,"I'm lucky enough to live near Carol, and be somewhat of a groupie. This is my favorite album of hers. The mature sound of her voice is better now than when she was younger. But this record (yes I'm showing my age as well)shows her voice in its very top form. And the song selection is fabulous. One Morning in May is my particular favorite. Overall the lyrics of loves remembered and existing long term loves further kindled is really rich in the thoughts they bring to mind, while the music really swings, even in the slower tempo songs.I know the Ballad Essentials series was meant as introductory records, but trust me, for the best sample of the most unsung singer in history, take it Sweet & Slow!"
2,Ditto... Don't Bother,"I couldn't agree more with the other 2-Star Review. Don't bother adding this to your collection. While John Goodall illustrates gorgeous books, the plot on this one is seriously lacking -- and not worth the greatly overpriced cost. Don't let the cute cover featuring an adorable mouse maiden in Renaissance garb fool you. I bought this for my 4-year-old daughter who absolutely adores Goodall's other classics: ""Shrewbettina's Birthday,"" ""Naughty Nancy Goes to School,"" and ""The Midnight Adventures of Kelly, Dot & Esmeralda."" This one, however, not only fell flat, but the images of the bats and dragon scared her to the point where we had to put the book away for some time before she was willing to look at it again -- and this is a child who is not easily scared. If you like wordless books, and aren't familiar with Goodall's other classics, the best to start with are ""Shrewbettina's Birthday"" and the ""Midnight Adventures of Kelly, Dot & Esmeralda."""
1,Im guilty.. read desciption,Thought I was buying a knife. For $5.00 plus $3.95 .. Total price of $8.95. I will check on returning.
4,Does The Job,Has all the important conversion ends you'll ever need while traveling in Europe. Worked great for me on my last trip.
5,Rocking and dreamy ... a perfect combination in an album,"""4"" is Foreigner's masterpiece. When it was released, it was a huge success and Foreigner ruled the airwaves. I played my LP until it wore out, and then I wore out the cassette. Thank God CDs are more reliable because this is an album I'll always want in my collection. The album provides a perfect balance of rocking songs (""Jukebox Hero,"" ""Break it Up"" and ""Urgent"") and dreamy ballads (""Waiting for a Girl Like You"" and ""Girl on the Moon""). How ""Girl on the Moon"" never became a huge hit just baffles me. It's a haunting and unforgettable song with brilliant synth work."
5,Another Great Album,Foreigner was always good. They had talent. My favorite song is Waiting for a Girl Like You. It just gives me love. Girl On The Moon is the same too. Great.Buy it now.
5,4 for Foreigner,"1. This group has produced some excellent, emotionally charged music, and this CD is a showcase of their best work.2. My raves for the faves include Juke Box Hero,Waiting for a Girl Like You, and I'm Gonna Win.3. No one listening to this music is going to doze off while it's on.4. Waiting for a Girl Like You is SO good, it is reprised in a ""nearly unplugged"" version, as is Juke Box Hero.You WILL like these cuts!"
4,A Great Album But Maybe Not The Best One I've Heard,"This is a great Foreigner LP. I love a few of these songson this album, the best song is probably I'm GONNA Win. My otherfavorites on this LP are the classics Jukebox Hero, Waiting for agirl like You, Urgent, & Girl on the Moon. But other than that itis rather got 5 good songs, and 5 bad songs. But anyway....recommended as best Foreigner album."
5,DVD Audio version (Must read),Apart from the CD and Vinyl version. The original Master sounds completely different. The CD and Vinyl version are over emphasized in the upper midrange and high frequencies. Even the cheapest equipment can hear the difference. It's that noticeable. If you want to hear the DVD-Audio version then I'd suggest you have a good system because the studio album is completely flat in a sense of equalization. Cheap system you will want to raise the upper mids and high frequencies. You can get it for far much less on HDtracks (under $20)at 24 bit/96Khz.
1,TRASH,FOREIGNER ARE THE WORST OF THE WORST.THEY ARE THE PITS AS THEY HAVE PRODUCED SUCH AWFUL SONGS SUCH AS WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU WHICH SUCKS.AVOID THIS AND GET ANY ALBUMS FROM PINK FLOYD INSTEAD.
1,Get any Beatles cd instead,"Waiting for a girl like you,you suck!!!.You and foreigner are the most stupid S@#T I have ever encountered,so just shut up and make sure that you buy ABBEY ROADS from the Beatles instead of the horrible album.LED ZEPPELIN ARE LEGENDS."
1,"TERRIBLE,TERRIBLE,TERRIBLE,TERRIBLE","WOW,HOW CAN ANYONE LIKE SUCH A HORRIBLE BAND.LOU GRAMM SOUNDS LIKE A DECAPITATED DUCK IN PAIN.EACH AND EVERY SONG IS A JOKE ESPECIALLY WIATING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU AND JUKE BOX HERO.THIS BAND IS AS BAD AS NIRVANA AND GUNS AND ROSES.DONT EVEN MAKE THE MISTAKE OF LISTENING TO THIS C@#P.GET LED ZEPPELIN'S DEBUT ALBUM INSTEAD.RIDE THE LIGHTNING"
3,A complete sell out to top '4'-ty pop!,"What were they trying to do? Mick Jones, your lead singer is Lou Gramm, not Blondie! Where did you get the idea to offer top-40 synth-pop to your fans? Oh wait! This album has made you millions and millions ($$$$$). Sorry Mick, now I understand. Now with Al and Ian out the way nothing should stop you getting Lou to sing watered down soft pop / synth pop.Okay, that is unfair, begins with a pretty good pop-rock song called 'Night Life', (which actually has the same lyrical theme as a Donna Summer song from the year before, also called 'Night Life'). That is followed by an even better 'Juke Box Hero' a stadium rock anthem about the biggest fans, aspiring rock stars.Foreigner shouldn't rock all the time, but the remaining music is fairly bland top 40 music, with only a few cuts making a real impression. Rating ** 1/2."
5,A Letter to 'Waiting For A Girl Like You'.,"Dear Waiting For A Girl Like You,I'm really in love with you. And would you please come to the phone? I would like for you to come to my house to play with me.That could be so sweet. I have been thinking of you since Christmas 2005. I feel kind of sad because I love you. You aremy sweet girlfriend. And if you could help me avoid Metallica,that could be great. What kind of music are you into? AnywayI hope you're doing well and I will see you soon. And always,give me a long hug or kiss each night before you tell me 'GoodNight' and I will be thinking of you and the times we had myfriend. Take care,Whirligig."
1,As I have not received this album yet I must honestly,confess that I despise rock music and that I purchased this CD for my girlfriend as she likes this kind of music. Perhaps I can write a review for her since she is getting this from amazon through me.
1,Not worth it,"Don't waste your money--put it towards an Elizabeth Zimmerman, Barbara Walker, Sally Melville or Melanie Falik book instead. I didn't find 1 pattern in here that I would use--it was either too complicated, impractical, dated looking or had a ridiculous guage."
5,Unvarnished Look at a Queen B,"While I've never been a fan of Katharine Hepburn's, I've always admired the work of James Robert Parish, and he does not disappoint in this richly detailed biography of the 4-time Oscarwinner. He takes us, step-by-step, from her birth in 1907, through her dysfunctional family life, her affairs with men and women, her unprofessional and immature behavior with colleagues, her attempts to rewrite her life story, to her passing in 2003."
1,Ruined By Rumor Mongering,"I was thrilled to find a new biography of Hepburn because she's such an intriguing personna. In this book, however, Parrish puts forth many rumors and hearsay as fact without bothering to back them up. This ruined what could have been an interesting bio for anyone curious about the Katharine Hepburn outside of the stage lots. Save your money and look elsewhere."
1,Don't believe the jacket!,"The books jacket says that it is well researched. In fact it is, but all the stuff about Kate and being bisexual is a matter of opinion. He never gives concrete information and uses what he does find he twist around to work in his favor. Although it is a good book for Kate facts, don't believe anything about her being bisexual."
5,These are the BEST!,"If you like Asiago cheese....these are a must have. Bought these the first time in Las Vegas, absolutely loved them, me and my friend. We searched for these for some time and finally found them. We HIGHLY recommend these to any and all Asiago lovers!!"
2,Very average,I read this book a number of years ago and lost it and bought it again. Now I know why I lost it. It doesn't say much that you can't already get from just reading the relevant passages on your own. Some of his exegesis is shaky at best. If you need to give this to a lay person that is getting introduced to the idea of church discipline it might be helpful.
3,Veeerrrryyyy Basic,"If you have a camera with any manual settings and know how to use them this book may be too basic for you. As another reviewer mentioned the images are poor quality, which can make it difficult to discern the point being made.If you're new to photography in general this isn't a bad book. If you're beyond that look elsewhere."
3,okay,"I listened to the CD but really wasn't that impressed. I LOVE their first CD, and I was expecting more from this one. I did really like ""merry christmas, happy holidays"" however."
5,Album lives up to expectation of ANY true NSYNC fan.,All I have to say it WOW. THis CD truly captures the talent of these 5 hot guys...their voices and harmonies really blend together to make this CD a treasure! (JC has the voice of an angel..) It really does put you in a holiday mood ! i recommend anyone who likes NSYNC to go out and buy it because you wont regret it. promise! peace and happy holidays to everyone!
5,THIS CD ROX! *NSYNC IS AWESOME!,This CD is sooooo great! I love it! This shows how different they are from the Backstreet Boys. I could never see the BSB doing an a cappella version of 'O Holy Night' at least not as good as these 5 very hot guys can do it! YEAH! NSYNC ROX!
5,THIS IS A GREAT CD!!,This CD is wonderful...it's not real cheesy like other crhistmas CDs...it's upbeat like N SYNC's music...I love it! I'm actually listening to it right now...it is something you can listen too all the time I feel because if you aren't listening to the words( which I do anyways) you can't really tell it's christmas music...once again this is a wonderful CD!
5,"It's great, a wonderful buy for Christmas!","This album is as great as their first work, only this time the songs deal with Christmas! The soul they put into their work never ceases to amaze me. Yeah, some people say that they're just ""another boy band,"" but I think they really work hard at what they do. Their songs can be great for any occasion. This album is a great example of this. Some songs make you want to cry, some make you smile and welcome the wonderful Christmas season. Two words for anyone who loves N Sync and Christmas: BUY IT!!"
5,A mix of old faves with some kickin' new songs!!,"Hey guys! I bought the CD the day it came out, and I listen to it everyday to and from college. It puts me in a great Christmas spirit and I sing at the top of my lungs while I'm driving and its playing! I really enjoy ""Love's in our hearts on Christmas"" and ""Kiss me at Midnight""... but I love the a cappella version of ""O Holy Night"". Ok, I've said all I wanna say, its a great albulm, and kepp up the great work guys!! -- Heather, 18"
5,Best Xmas CD in a long time. Something for everyone!,"This is the most awesome Christmas CD released in a very long time. The new stuff is great with the same *N Sync heart and soul that makes them stand out. The traditional songs are recognizeable but again with the *N Sync sound that sets them apart from the same old tired recordings we hear time after time. My 5 yo daughter, 15 yo sister, 50 yo mother and 70 yo grandfather all love it - something for everyone!"
5,It has been Christma in my house since the CD was released.,The album is great. I especially love the romantic lyrics. I just pretent that they're singing them to me. The guys voices are great. Justin has the sexiest voice. The guys and the CD are great.
5,"""Home for Christmas"" expresses different meanings","I love the idea of a Christmas album (for one thing, it proves depth of ""teen stars"" in some popular groups), and I love the sound of 'N Sync's Christmas album. I started to cry when I opened up the album booklet and read that some of the group members made a point to acknowledge Jesus Christ, the real reason for the season. While coming ""home for Christmas"" is a sweet idea that should hold true forever (keeping in touch with family and such) I find that it also can represent one's personal spiritual path. Coming ""home for Christmas"" can mean, for me at least, to realize the truth of the holiday and to take this time of year to wake up, change your ways, and return back to God, your true home. Thank God for these people, who are bold enough to state their religion publicly and live it, and may they provide an example for some fans to discover their own spirituality. Merry Christmas!"
4,The Best Christmas CD!,"Well done N'Sync. This cd is very good, better then 98 degrees lame try. Here are my favourites:Home For ChristmasMerry Christmas, Happy HolidaysIt's ChristmasO Holy NightKiss Me At MidnightThe other songs were ok. This CD is the best to whack on Christmas day when you are opening presents or eating Chrissy dinner. Well I know it sure will be at my house!"
