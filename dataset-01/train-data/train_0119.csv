3,"WORKS, BUT...","I've been struggling with heel pain from plantar fasciitis. I had high hopes for this product, having previously used the more cast-like products which are too immobilizing. This is far less constricting and even lets you get up to walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Unfortunately there is a BUT coming. If I adjust the velcro on my foot with even a little bit of pressure (which is needed) I wake up with tingling in my toes. No matter how much I try adjusting the pressure it doesn't seem to help. I'd love to give this product 5 stars, because it does help, but I can't."
4,Plantar Fascitis Relief,"I was surprised how easy and effective this little device was for helping alleviate my chronic PF symptoms. After years of boxing, jumping rope and running, my feet were a mess. By the time I finally went in and got my diagnosis, my PF tendon was swollen to twice it's normal size. I tried everything from ice, heat, salves, and even regular shots of cortisone, to no avail. This thing works pretty well. I alternate feet from night to night. 2 consecutive nights usually does the trick."
4,Helps a lot with Plantar Facia!,"Really has worked wonders. I've been wearing it everynight for about 3 weeks now. I'm finally able to start running again. I was living with the pain everyday and wasn't running for about two months. After wearing it for two weeks, I was able to run the Army 10-miler. Even now after a hard run, I still hobble a bit the morning after - but it's not nearly as bad as it once was. I would buy this in conjunction with the foot rocker. You have stretch out the muscle quite a bit, but this splint helps much more than I ever expected."
1,Jagged Little Swill,"This album confirmed all of my worst suspicions about Alanis Morissette. Jagged Little Pill was a landmark not only for Alanis, but for millions upon millions of other people. What she wants to consider a commemoration is more like a travesty. The vocals are downright awful here, not giving the listener any indication of emotion. Alanis has taken a masterpiece and dragged it through the mud. I was a tremendous fan of Alanis Morissette even as millions of others deserted her over the years, but this has pushed me past my threshold. Shame on her for desecrating something so beautiful for the sake of money."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzz,This album is more boring than a Sarah McLachlan one and that's saying a lot. Alanis can't sing anymore and she's ruined what was a great album by creating silly acoustic versions that aren't worth your time. I just wish she'd realize she's washed up and only a select few actually care about her anymore.
1,Make it STOP!!!!!,"Like a bad recurring nightmare, here she comes again, screeching and howling her way through this set of self-obsessed, navel-gazing songs that attack the ears like a blast of pins. Owch! Forced to do some 'remote officing' at a internet hotspot at the local Starbucks this week, I am beaten into a pulp by this grating CD which is on a non-stop loop. The perfect spot for it actually, a crass, corporate slice of muzak - shows that she has no artistic integrity left - but must hop up and down on the same spot she wore out years ago. Tragic."
1,Um...why bother?,The original Jagged Little Pill was awesome and is still one of my absolute favourites....this is a lack-luster warmed up version of it - almost like a parody of the original and ironically put out by the same edgey terrific artist who put the original Jagged Little Pill out....this is just.....stale. I'd love to hear some NEW stuff from Alanis - enough of this warmed up unplugged stuff please....!
2,Why did this need to be done?,"A generally uninspired album. Listening to this you can tell the only reason that anyone would ever rerecord their largest selling record is a yearning to be as successful now as they were then.All that being said the new acoustic Head Over Feet is a great new take on the song, and is definately worth listening to."
2,An absolute waste of money,"I was foolish enough to pay $18.99 (BEFORE taxes) for this at Starbucks thinking I'd once again fall in love with Morissette's classic ""Jagged Little Pill"" album. Instead of enjoying her acoustic spin on her breakthrough CD I was bored to tears with the bland arrangements and horrible singing. Alanis has lost what little passion she had left and it's quite obvious that is a filler album and not an ode to the album that made her one of the most influential singers in recent history."
5,A slow down remake of the original,"A great concept, the original Jagged Little Pill was the best album Alanis ever put out. It's no surprise that she's decided to revamp the album, considering that none of her other albums won her anything special, except Jagged Little Pill. The original was a young and bitter girl; this new acoustic version shows the softer side of Alanis, while still getting her point across. If only she could create new albums that run along the lines of Jagged Little Pill, because all the other ones are nothing compared to this."
5,Worth The Money,"Some are saying there's no use in buying this album if you already have the studio album. I strongly disagree. This album is worthwhile to have. Not only do the songs sound refreshing after many years of the studio versions, but I think the acoustic is more beautiful and shows Alanis' more mature vocals after all these years.I know many will hate me for saying this, but I actually prefer the acoustic over the studio album. I just love what she has done with the songs on here, and actually prefer many of the tracks acoustic over the studio ones. Like All I Really Want, Perfect and Mary Jane I much prefer on this album and actually enjoy more than I did on the original. Don't get me wrong, I still have many tracks from the original I love, but to say there is no use in buying this album is insane to me. It's an excellent album any Alanis fan needs.5/5"
3,Nice Spin on Classic Songs,"When this CD came out last year, I asked myself WHY? Then I decided, WHY NOT? How many artists can claim to having one of the top selling albums of all time? Especially with an emotional impact as ""Jagged Little Pill"".The acoustic version offers great spins on ""All I Really Want"", ""Perfect"", ""Hand In My Pocket"", ""Mary Jane"", ""Ironic"", ""Not The Doctor"" and ""Wake Up"".Especially nice to hear Alanis and Glen Ballard collaborate again...hope they do so again, in the future.Not an essential purchase, but a must for fellow Lani fans."
3,not as good as the original,"The songs as still wonderful in their Alanis-ness, but they aren't different enough from the originals to be a must-have item. The melodies are slightly different, and the musicianship is more organic sounding, but the vocals sound less emotional. Worth listening to, but not a must-have."
5,a+++,"10 years ago Alanis Morissette's ""Jagged Little Pill"" was a powerhouse of a hit. Its catchy tunes and phrasing were captivating, but its hard-hitting lyrics made it a standout on the music scene. The re-release of this album in an acoustic format allows Ms. Morissette's lyrics to stand front and center and they are every bit as powerful and thought-provoking today as they were when they were new. For fans, this is akin to a drive down a familiar country road or slipping into a well-worn, well-loved bulky sweater. For newcomers, this is an introduction to one of the premier songwriters of the last 3 decades.A great album when originally released, but the acoustic version is actually much better. Excellent production, seems to capture the true energy and emotion of the songs, and her vocal performance is an A+."
2,Not worth bothering with,"I hedge that I've heard only Ironic and Hand in my Pocket on this album but those versions are sub-par. The songs in their original format should not he acousticized (is that a word?). A total remix of Jagged little pill (great album) would have been wonderful--something like what Linkin Park did with Reanimation or Sarah Mclachlan did with her Rarities album, but this is just a plain cash grab and worth skipping."
4,Wood Spring Clothespins,"I was pleased with the quick delivery of my clothespins. I also ordered a clothesline and pin holder and was pleased to be able to use all of these together to go a little greener. If anyone would like to do something to save energy, this is a good way to do that."
2,Penley 027 50 pack wook spring clothespin,Penley 027 50 pack Wood Spring ClothespinThey're cheaply made and flimsy. I would never have bought them if I had touched them. Typical junk made in China.
2,"Not ""Made in USA"" as shown","Ad shows Made in USA on Bag , ones that I received were Made in China. BEWARE!!!"
2,Cheap springs,"I bought the pack of 50 for line-drying; half a dozen loads of laundry later, I'm down 10 from where I started. The spring coils are cheap and have very little pressure. The springs also shift so much that unless you use pliers to crunch them back together (constantly), they snap on the line. I'm tired of re-washing clothes that fell in the dirt! The place I bought them (small town, only option) only carries that brand, so I'll be doing the replacement shopping online."
2,fall apart easily,"These clothespin fall apart easily and damage your clothing. The ends that slide over the clothing are not smooth. Since it is only a cheap product, I did not take the effort to get my money back."
2,Mixed review. Will not purchase again.,"I purchased two bags of these at our local hardware store. One bag was fine. The clothespins were sturdy and strong. The other bag was not. The springs continued to pop off. Neither bag was suitable for delicates as none of the pins had been sanded where they grip the clothing, so nylon garments snagged on them. It is hit or miss with this brand. Some of the pins are fine for sturdy materials and others are not.From what I have seen, all wooden pegs and most platic ones, are made in China now. They simply do not last. It is unfortunate."
4,A fine book about a concerning subject,"Unfortunately, this is the only book that deals with completely with the death of Anna Mae Aquash. Very informative and very disturbing at times, it will leave you demanding justice and wanting to know more. By itself, this book is slighlty incomplete. However, along with the absolutely necessary ""In the Spirit of Crazy Horse"" and along with the Anna Mae Aquash sites at Dickshovel.com, you will begin to truly appreciate the direness of the situation, even 25 years after Anna Mae's death. Peace be with you."
4,"""ok, but wanted different information""","The book was thoughtfully written and was a very easy read. I was hoping it was going to be a biographical sketch of Anna Mae Aquash's life, but much of it read like a summary of The American Indian Movement, The Wounded Knee Occupation, FBI corruption in the 1960s and 1970s, and violence on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Although Anna Mae was involved in all of these themes of the time, very little was written about her work and involvement. The beginning and end of the book was a detailed description about Anna Mae and her life and death which was extremely sad. If you have never read about The American Indian Movement or the events that define much of it you will really like this book. If you are knowledgeable about those times, this book will leave you with empty questions and wanting to read more about Anna Mae herself. I feel another book needs to be written about her life that develops from where this book started."
3,"Great Q's, but fix the CD...","The questions in this material are excellent, and better than Kaplan's Qbank. The problem with the material is that the CD has too many problems, as it was designed quite unthoughtfully. After purchasing the cd and book, the chances of going through all 1400 Qs is an impossibility without redoing other questions again and again. It is an inefficient way to study, and big set back to the materials. I highly recommend buying this material but they really need to fix the CD."
2,What a waste of money... Do not buy!!!!!,"First of all let me just say that the question you get on the book are repeated to you on the cd-rom, so for those of you thinking, like I did, that you're getting a total of 1400 questions, YOU'RE NOT. Second of all, the cd-rom doesn't have a save option so you'll be repeting questions each time you use it and you'll never do them all because of that. Third, the questions are either way to easy or impresively hard to find in your regular study reviews. And finally,to DAVE BROWN in Tempe AZ, the guy who wrote the first review on this book here: next time try and check everything about a item (book in this case) before you give it 5 stars, cause most people read these reviews and follow advise, and in this case yours sucked big time."
2,arm pocket has changed,"I have previously owned 2 of these but now it is larger. The wrist is about 1"" larger in diameter and it about 3/4"" wider. The material is also lighter. I prefer the earlier type. I love the arm pocket concept and I have worn one daily for about 5 years in place of carrying a purse, but this is too large for me and I have worn out the old one. I will miss it!!"
5,"big and expensive but hurrah, it WORKS!","The problem with most wrist wallets is that unless you have a huge wrist, when you fasten them to your wrist, the wallet contours to your wrist and you don't have much continuous FLAT space to accommodate 3"" car key. The result is not only uncomfortable, unsightly, but also untenable because the pointed end of the key is bound to make a hole in the fabric sooner or later.This is the only wrist wallet Amazon carries that lists its actual width as being 3.75"" --- which would be ample for 95% of keys out there. Don't know if it has a terry liner to soak up sweat while exercising though, since it's not being marketed as a ""sports"" accessory but more of a travel accessory."
1,penlight,"I should say, at the start, that I repel anything with batteries or electrical power. That said, I am free to write that this penlight didn't last very long. The clicking end that turns the light on and off would click, but not turn the light off. In the middle of the night when you're trying not to wake a sick, sleeping child, clicking a penlight 100 times isn't ideal. I ended up having to leave the light on, forgetting about it, and letting it die. Then, I went to the supply room and got the cheap one. If you do not repel technology and want something that looks a little classier, this penlight is fine. Good luck."
4,Oldie but goodie,The first six or seven minutes are a travelogue of Rome and worth the price of the DVD. Frank Sinatra sings the title song. Just sit back and enjoy. The story is dated but that's half the fun.
4,Three Coins in the Fountain,"A delightful love story though the male superiority overtones may be somewhat distasteful to today's modern woman. I enjoyed it for it'ssimplicity, no sex or nudity, hard crime, blood, bad language...."
3,a gorgeous travelogue & interesting insight into social mores of 50 years ago,"there are worse ways to wile away an evening than revisiting this (in its own way) fascinating look at the 1950s. this is not the world of douglas sirk, tho it may have many of the same characteristics. its a world where independent women wind up with the guys they love, and everybody manages to dress well. the movie is gorgeous to watch, a prime example of how cinemascope was utilized to lure fans who were deserting their weekly movie habit in favor of television. a great travelogue for roma and its environs, and of course theres that infectious theme music which youll never shake."
3,THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN,I LIKED THIS MOVIE BUT I THOUGHT THE REMAKE WITH LONI ANDERSON WAS MUCH BETTER. I'D LIKE TO BUY THAT VERSION BUT DONT SEE IT LISTED. ANY SUGGESTIONS?
2,Predictable and boring...,"I found myself fast forwarding through some scenes in this film hoping to get to the good parts, which never materialized. How is it that in a city of millions of people the streets of Rome were empty? How did Anita get to park her car at the entrance of the international airport? How did she park the car next to the Trevi Fountain on a street so narrow cars can't get through and so crowded with people 24/7? Come on, half of this film was probably shot on a Hollywood studio back lot. If you want the real deal romantic comedy get Roman Holiday and see the sights as they are even today. Three Coins was a waste of my money."
3,hilariously trashy romantic fantasy,"It's not up to ""Rome Adventure"" in awfulness, since it doesn't have Troy Donahue in it (a terrible oversight), but it does have Louis Jordan as some sort of Italian (!) royalty. It's a very pretty movie that makes as little sense as ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" and ""The Best of Everything"" (two other bloviated triumphs by the same director). Anyway, it's a terrible movie, and I really like it, although I think that TBOE is the better piece of trash (the ending is even more jaw-droppingly astonishing than this one)."
1,Here's my two cents about Three Coins...,"I must go easier on this film than I would like seeing as it was made in the 50s. Being 19, I'm sure I can't appreciate the calm and painfully cheesy medea of that era. Still, I AM a fan of old movies and enjoy the laid back plots of the older days. O brother. This plot was certainly laid back - in fact, I think it laid all the way back and went to sleep! Three girls fall for three guys. The end! Each girl ended up with the first guy they liked, no surprises or intrigues. There was a gliche to each relationship, but it was ironed out smoothly before you could actually figure out what the big deal was. Two of the men were goony dreamboats, madly in love with their American beauties. The other was a cranky boss who tried terribly hard to be endearing but missed the mark by a mile. Quite predicatable, extremely boring... stick with the good oldies such as Born Yesterday, On The Town, Roman Holiday and the like."
1,BORING TRASH,"This movie is just plain trash, and I don't mean that in a good way. It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a melodrama and it might've been good if they'd stuck to one or the other. As it is, it's just a painfully boring, poorly-scripted movie that did have occasional bursts of excellence (although if you blink, you'd miss 'em), but not enough to make it worth watching. Even the Italian scenery isn't worth the price of a rental, and certainly not worth the cost of actually buying it. If you're looking for Italy, you'd do better watching a travel video-- it'd probably be more interesting than this movie, anyways."
4,Three Coins in the Fountain,"Having seen this movie when I was in high school (many years ago) I bought the DVD to enjoy with my 15 year old granddaughter. She enjoys the ""oldies"" and we have a grand time watching them togeether. Lots of glorious scenery and a warm hearted story with no foul language."
5,Three Coins in a Fountain,This film was instumental in my current wife droppin three coins in the Trevi Fountain in hope that I might propose to her! In 2009 my son was encourage to do the same when we were there! He is currently engaged to be married and we just celebrated our 40th wedding anni!versary
3,"NOT A ""BLOCKBUSTER""","I remembered this movie from when I was a kid and thought that my mom would enjoy it since she can' really relate to many of the current movies. This movies is really long and drawn out. There are, like another reviewer said, great scenes of Italy, but all in all a ""yawn."""
5,The Gothic Cathedral,"What a magnificent book. After being totally enthralled with Pillars of the Earth (in book and TV movie), my husband was surprised and thrilled to receive this book. It's educational and beautifully portrays the unbelievable architecture of the past centuries. A truly worthy addition to our historical library."
2,"Close, but a long way to go!","Bought this gun hoping that it would give me great glue. The shape, fit, feel are all very comfortable. Switchable hi/low switch separate from on/off switch was great. Color changing LED to tell you when it's ready was great. Trigger and glue feed work really well. My gripes and they're big: it takes forever to heat up and and you can only get a small amount of glue through it before you have to wait for a while for it to heat up more glue. Even on the high setting. Dremel has what could be a GREAT hot glue gun, but it's significantly underpowered."
1,ALBUM TITLE IS IN POOR TASTE,"Hollywood, CA (March 18th 2004) - The label Horizon-Italy has recently released an unapproved album titled Burning House of Love. This album is not approved by GREAT WHITE. Rather the band condemns this release and asks all fans and friends not to purchase this album. They feel that the label is insensitive to the victims of the fire and are trying to capitalize on a tragic situation. This type of practice is called repackaging - record companies take previously released songs, put on a new cover with a new title.The band and their attorneys are working on stopping this release, as it is being sold under the GREAT WHITE name without GREAT WHITE'S permission. GREAT WHITE wants to apologize for any discomfort this may have caused, as they found out about this release much the same way as the fans - via the internet. It was of great shock to the GW camp."
1,A sad state of business,Reading the above reviews and just plain common sense would have me believe this is not a real release. Certainly not new material. I have no doubt the band would not release such a title. Think before you buy.
1,Boring,"Bassist Billy Sheehan, keyboardist John Novello, and drummer Dennis Chambers just sit there and play through a set of ten jazz-fusion style instrumental numbers. There's no denying their talent at their respective instruments, but combined together it's rather boring."
5,God in All worlds,"Lucinda Vardey's anthology of contemporary spiritual writing has been a gift to me since I received it in 1996, the year my son died of AIDS. I found so much healing in the words contained in this book and have used as a meditative tool and confort since my son's death. I espceially liked her chapters on death and on awe."
5,This is the book!,I have hundreds of books on fruit/vegetable decorating..Well nothing beats this! If I would be able to pick only one this would be it!!
4,Other Version of the Same Book,Just for your information: In 1980 Rider published this book (Zen: Merging of East and West) in paperback under the title 'Zen: Dawn in the West'.
5,love it,i chose this cd because i had it 6 years ago and someone broke into my car and stole it thank you amarzon makin it possible for me to replace it/
5,Good for Serbian winters!,"Bought these for a friend who lives in Belgrade, Serbia, and works outside during the winter. Her report is they are well made and are standing up, so far, to the tough wear and tear that she is putting them through. They are warm in deep snow and are comfortable with even the thickest socks. The light color is easy to clean because of the finish on the exterior; dirt and grime just wash away with mild soap and a little scrubbing with a soft brush. Sturdy, warm boot with excellent workmanship."
5,You Too Can Be Delivered: Keys to Walking in Personal Deliverance,"This is an excellent book to read about how other's were delivered from a situation. It gives you the courage to believe that if it happened for that person, it can happen for me too. I am glad I bought this book and hope to be able to share it with others in the near future."
5,Excellent,"This book is pretty good if I do say so myself. I have been looking for a book about supernatural beings and paranormal entities for a while now, so I had to get this book when I so it. I'm glad to say that it didn't dissapoint me. Everything from ghosts, bigfoot, werewolf and sea-type creatures to the creatures of fairy, demons and alien type figures. And this book didn't overly sensationalize things either. For instance, the section on vampires makes it fairly clear that MOST vampire cases are simply people who thrive off of warm blood.... not necessarily the sexy, super-powerful undead beings shown in hollywood. It also talks about the reality of demons and how they do indeed manifest themselves and sometimes harass people in physical ways but that there are many ""human"" monsters who are simply possessed by these ill beings. All in all, this book is excellent for those who take any sort of interest in the world beyond."
3,Always Time,"There is always this romantic idea of previous loves in other lives meeting again, of love intertwined through the ages. Some of the most romantic stories, books and movies have used this premise.Kay Hooper uses this idea to write of Alex; a former lady lion tamer who just happens to still have her toothless harmless pussycat of a lion living with her and her present and past love Noah. They meet and dream of their former lives and of course fall in love again.All great romances are unrealistic, in that they are so rare, but they are wonderful to read about.This book doesn't have the amount of pre-life flashbacks I would have enjoyed reading about and the depth is simplistic on both characters and descriptions of the world around them. I wish there was more concentration on that, especially of their lives before; but the book was a nice read and a certain escape from the world around most readers."
4,Quick Classic Read by a Favorite Author,"This is a very quick read. That can be both a pro and a con for me, but I must have picked this book up at just the right time.I loved that it was fairly simple, basic read. I enjoyed their story very much. It was romantic, amusing, and just the perfect kind of book for a rainy Fall afternoon."
4,novel,The book was good. It was good for a quick read and exactly what it was advertised as. I didn't like it as well as Kay Hooper's usual books.
5,They Don't come Much Better,"This author has been very prolific over the years and I would rate this the best book of the bunch. With his co-author he has set out to make the book as interesting and colourful as possible. This is a plant finders dream and until recently there was nothing else that came close to it. The pictures are excellent and the text informative. There are masses of information for the hobbyist, truly something new for everyone. I only wish I could get a copy of it for my collection. Copies seem to be few and far between in England and the sellers who have it on Amazon.com do not ship to the UK. I digress. This book filled a huge void created by the books published before it. If you do not have a copy try and get one."
2,cuts with no handle,Cuts great if only I can keep the handle on the blade. There is a cheap plastic button that holds the handle onto the blade... well its not holding and never did!
5,Innovative,"On Power , Dissent and Racism gives a clear and thoughtful summary on Chomsky's opinions to present day problems. Chomsky's commentary on anti Semitism and racism are informative and as usual enlightening. I highly recommend this film to Chomsky lovers as well as to anyone who would like to have an introduction to one of the greatest minds of all times. A+!"
4,ha-ha bruce wayne,"Honestly, this natas wouldn't give a sh*t about some cRAP album. This is actually real music with instruments and thought put into it. That other stuff is just what I said before...cRAP music. No real skill involved with that type of music in my opinion."
1,not original,"this is not the rap group Natas, these fakers ripped off their name, and i would not call this music, it is pathetic, don't get this spanish trash mixed up with the REAL natas."
4,bossa electrica,"not just another boss-a-troniq release! Sounds quite fresh for a Lounge, Break'n'bossa and all Brazilectro lover! It will go to my collection and if you like jazzy, downtempo Brasilian beats it's just the record you should listen to. Smooth and catchy but not popular music, moving from acustic to electronic sound. Hope that somebody who knows anything about this record writes a review with all the important data. For me it's just an extraordinary one."
2,Yaawn,"Oh, sorry, I fell asleep! Had a hard time staying awake threw this one. Just seems like another novel with a happy little ending, Ho...Humm... so predictable! It would have been nice to see real life struggles, such as, due to her ex husband not paying taxes, the IRS came after her, resulting in putting a lean on her home, took her IRA account, (retirement fund) and lost her job! What in the world would she do then along with her inner turmoil with her sister death and fathers meaness. If we are going to have problems,lets have some real ones (money) that we all can relate to!"
3,not good for the beginners.,"I was required to buy this book because of my professor. However, I could not understand the book easily. I am not recommending this book for the SAS beginners. Maybe, they should look at other books. If they know about SAS, they may buy and analyze it, pretty cheap and good book for the later steps."
4,Nice book but you need to know the subject!,This is a nice book if you know the subject from another book ! - otherwise the explanation is limited.
2,Not that great of a book,Uselfull for experienced people in the field. You are expected to know the subject early on. the book mostly provied an example for each of the subjects and explains them tersly. This wasen't what i expected
1,Brooklyn Style Politics and the Lady DA,"A truly boring book, more propaganda than legal theory. Ms. Pirro manages to write a most frivolous and banal story even with the services of a ""co-author"". I can only imagine what the writing would have been like had she actually taken the time to write it herself. We assume lawyers should be able to write reasonably cogent, coherent arguments but apparently Ms. Pirro's law school didn't emphasize writing as an art form. A complete waste of time and money!"
1,Sally Jane Raphael and Jeanine Pirro.,"What do sally Jane Raphael and Jeannine Pirro have in common? Apparently quite a bit. They are both good behind the camera with their false smiles and faux sincerity. They are both great at twisting facts and destorting the truth. They are both narcissists in love with their image. They are both so driven for fame that they would easily sell their souls and their children's souls to achieve it. And last, but not least, neither one of them can write without a co-author. I spent good money on a very dull and frivolous book, how can I get my money back!"
1,"TERRIBLE ,MUST BE NON FICTION","HATED IT ,SEEMS TO BE SELF ENDEARING FOR AN ARROGANT FAN BASE,I DIDNT SEEM TO COME ACROSS ANYTHING RELATING TO HER TRIP TO FL. WHERE SHE WAS SITED FOR ENDULGING HERSELF WITH EXOTIC CARS,ETC.NORE HER RESEMBLANCE TO THE CHARACTER IN CAPE FEAR,SHE STILL THINKS THE FBI ARE STEALTHALLY STALKING HER,THROUGH THE PHONES, AND WIRES IN HER CAR RADIO,SHE RELIES TO HEAVILLY ON PUBLICITY AND ,WELL, ETC."
4,"Greatest Hits? Well, not really.","The song list is correct, but the cover shown is not the same as the CD I received. I suspect that this has been released several times, with different covers. Great music. Some of the tracks are live versions, not the studio hits."
4,Wonderful introduction,"This is a basic introduction on a very large and complex history. Broken up chronologically and further by dynasty, the structure of this book lends a coherence that is very easy to understand. It is a wonderful way to gain a greater understanding of Islamic art and how its influences have shaped art history."
5,"This book is the best gift for the Holliday season and all year around for your friends, family and anybody else you care about.","Dr. Shalts M.D., D.Ht. a homeopath with 20 + years of clinical and academic experience is also a Trustee of the American Institute of Homeopathy and a Vice-President of the National Center for homeopathy. Somehow he managed to find a time from his busy schedule to write a guide book on a subject of Homeopathy. And what a gem it is! Although addressed to parents implying ""pediatric"" applications this book is clearly a guide for adults on how to maintain physical and mental health for their children and for themselves.The book is written in lucid stile by using clear and precise language equally understandable to and acceptable by different segments of reading public such as regular folks as well as seasoned biomedical professionals"
2,there are better books out there,"I really wanted to like this book as it got good reviews. Being a parent with above average intelligence, I figured I could really use this book. I was wrong. The author does give a very good history of homeopathy, but otherwise the book is disorganized, hard to follow and hard to use. I wanted a guide to help a novice (me)navigate the homeopathy offerings at wholefoods - this was not the book."
3,A product that has a future ... but just not there yet.,"Add fairly good add-on and support for Power Point presentations, but it does currently have limited things to offer.after the initial impressive presentation and probably after you've downloaded the 15-day trial version, you'll begin to rethink your initial views of the software.It does work and can indeed brighten up presentations. But in my honest opinion as a presentation skills coach and trainer, I would say that the software has potential but is not quite there yet in terms of wowing and retaining that initial impression you get when you come across it.Try the 15-day trial first before you commit to any purchase decision. It'll help you make up your mind better."
1,Too robust for machines older than a year,"I use PowerPoint a great deal as a teacher and thought this would upgrade my presentations. Unfortunately, every one of my computers had insufficient video memory to allow the software to work. For now, it sits on my shelf until I can purchase more powerful equipment. Certainly not for the casual user. It isn't the magic black box that will make you a star."
1,DEADWARE: Does NOT work in Vista...,"...and Adobe as ZERO plans to EVER support Vista. It's a seriously great program, though, if you're planning to use XP for the rest of your life (smirk). I'm VERY disappointed in Adobe for dangling hope in their user forums for well over a year before finally pulling the plug forever."
5,My son sleeps with this book,Need I say more? We'll have to buy another copy when this one wears out! No words but a thoroughly enjoyable story. I look forward to more from this author
4,A Lushly Detailed Wordless Fantasy,"A lushly detailed, wordless picture book about a boy on a field trip to the Empire State Building who is befriended by a sentient cloud. The cloud sneaks him into the cloud factory assigned for his sector of the planet, and some funny adventures ensue. Some of Wiesner's dreamlike fantasy stories are surreal in an Alice-in-Wonderland way - depending on the reader, it could be wonderful or disorienting. This one is mostly fun, and is very funny. The only potentially concerning element is that the boy sneaks onto the cloud factory property, and gets in trouble for it while the grownups running the show are shown to be a little silly. For a child with authority issues this book might help to feed a rebellious heart. Aside from this, the wonderful artwork, the masterful use of images to tell the story without words, and the strikingly original story concept makes this worth having."
3,Just okay.,"Let me first make sure everyone understands that THERE ARE NO WORDS in this book. This is truly just a story based upon pictures. With that said, I think it is a wonderful idea to create a book in which children are allowed to make up their own stories based upon what they see, and find messages in thoughtful illustrations. I just didn't have the same enthusiasm the other readers had for these illustrations, and neither did my children. They are interesting to look through once, but I am not thrilled with how they are sized and layed out on a page, in addition to the manner in which they are drawn. The imagination in this book is truly unique, and I give it credit for that. I just don't think it deserves a five star rating."
4,Ever Wonder Where Clouds Come From?,"What would happen if a boy made friends with a cloud? In the picture book Sector 7, (Clarion, 1999), David Weisner explores that question by launching the reader into the fantastical journey of a young boy and a restless cloud. Together, they explore Sector 7, the factory that dispatches clouds. While there, he helps the clouds secretly revolt against their boring old shapes by giving each cloud a sea creature to imitate. But will he get away before the Sector 7 staff catches him? A thrilling adventure that uses no words, the reader will be captivated by each panoramic watercolor illustration of the cold steel of Sector 7 and of the sky filled with creatures from the deep seas. The illustrations tell the story with ease, Weisner sometimes using a comic book style to move the reader through his tale. This book is a feast for the eyes and readers will not be able to resist cheering for the boy and his rambunctious cloud friend."
5,A Lesson in Dreaming,"My 19-month-old absolutely adores this book. I was a little surprised at first as the storyline is pretty complex, but the very rich illustrations spark his imagination. My husband and I have immensely enjoyed creating a narrative around the characters in the book, but sometimes also just sit with him as he flips through the book and looks at the pictures. Do not hesitate to buy this book. This book may not promote pure reading skills (no words), but it teaches a child how to dream."
5,"This is beautiful, soothing music.. you will love it!","Cheryl has a beautiful voice, even her speaking voice is soothing! The arrangements are beautiful. This is beautiful and peaceful; I highly recommend it!"
4,Fast Reading,"If you feel like getting a little ""spooked"" and you don't have much time, this is a great book. The author hooks you right from the start and the writing is quick paced so the action moves right along. I had a hard time putting it down until I found out how it all ended!"
4,As an actor -- it reaches a bit far,"Speaking as an actor who has done college productions of both ""The Complete Works of William Shakespeare"" and ""The Complete History of America,"" let me start by saying this script is just as funny, if not funnier, than the previous two. However, speaking as someone who is performance-minded, I gotta think this one goes a bit overboard. It's not the controversy -- heck, I'm Catholic myself and the jokes don't bother me -- but some of the bits included require a bit more skill than your average person has. What if no one in your production can play the accordion? Or the piano? Or balance a ladder on his chin? And while I enjoyed learning to make balloon animals for ""The Complete History of America,"" who the heck do you call to teach you how to juggle flaming torches? Still, it really is a fun script and I only wish I had the opportunity to watch these guys perform it in person."
1,Not worthprice!,"I was VERY disappointed in this CD. THe songs were poor, the singers were WORSE!I don'tknow what happened to the SMC? Other CD""s were very good!"
2,No Engineering,"While this crusher primitively demonstrates the function of a lever, that's almost all it's good for. For one, the can stack constantly jams the next can up behind the piston during use. This does not subside by simply reducing the amount of ""crush"" you apply to the previous can; the following can tips back and stands up behind the piston. As mashing the lever back and forth does little to unjam things, we are now reduced to a one-can-at-a-time scenario. I paid twice as much as I could have for other single can models.Finally, even with a healthy coat of lithium grease on the piston guides, this crusher ground right through it's ""powder coated"" finish after only a couple of uses."
4,Good can crusher,"This is the successor to the one I bought many years ago, now worn out. As with the old one, I found I needed to grease the rails on which the plunger slides. I also greased the holes where the plunger bail attaches to the handle. Had I done the latter with the old one, it would probably still be working, but it broke where it wore through.I also found that I had to bend the ends of the plunger bail where it goes into the holes in the handle, or it would slip out near the end of travel.Once you've done all that, it's a very good can crusher."
3,Construction is weak,"I bought this multi-can crusher and mounted it in my garage. After loading it up for the first time, a pull on the handle did not result in a crushed can. It resulted in the handle popping out of the mechanism. After bending the ends inward a bit, the product can now crush cans. It feels quite flimsy when crushing a can."
2,Cheaply engineered,"After doing about 4 dozen cans, the handle started to bend and spread at the pivot and the bail wire for the crusher plate started to slip out. After that it's trash. Recommend Dial Industries can crusher made from polystyrene. Its better designed, holds 10 cans and half the price."
3,Can Crusher,"This product is adequate for your typical home use. It's problems consist of outdated design & worksmanship. For example, in the past, all the cans were basically the same size making the multi-can stack very nice; but now some cans are smaller, some are larger, throwing off the whole idea of the ""Cage"" or ""shute"" loading system. Also, too much pressure on the handle will bow it and pop the handle out."
4,Crusher,"This is a great can crusher, that easily crushes. It also holds multiple cans which allows you to crush multiple cans in a shorter amount of time."
5,Works Great!,This is a well made sturdy product and it works as advertized right out of the box. I had read some reviews before buying that said they had to do a minor modification to get the cans to feed correctly into the crushing chamber. Mine worked flawlessly without modification.
2,Jams Easily,Crushes cans OK but you have to stop and clear jams every few cans. Cans larger than 12 oz. do not fit.
3,Great concept but there is room for improvement,"When there are several cans in the crusher, the crusher tends to flip the next can to be crushed up into the others causing a ""jam"". This can be fixed easily enough with some alteration to the crushing base but obviously would prefer to have had it correct from the manufacturer."
2,Don't waste your money,"We bought this one to replace a cheap one that lasted berely 2 weeks. We read all the reviews and decided that it would fit our needs and all the comments gave it raving reviews. We purchased it on June 28, 2012 and before August 28, 2012 it just fell apart. A big waste of money because now we have to buy a third one.Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and really get a decent one that will last for more 2 months."
5,Melissa is awesome!,"I scrubbed through the movie to find my friend Melissa, who I found at about minute 58 driving a jeep behind the hero's jeep. They pull up to a stop sign almost together. We get a good look at Melissa who is looking morose. What a star!"
4,Superwinch Mount Kit,The Superwinch Mount Kit was the correct mount for my Honda 350 Rancher. Easy to install. No problems with shipment and received all parts necessary.
4,Mehhh,"This was an ok read , I would recommend it to someone who was unfamiliar with the law of God and how he set up provisions for the leaders, and the poor through tithing although in my opinion there are some issues that look intentionally left out, yet all in all pretty good."
5,Read it.,"Thought provoking. Upsetting. Revolutionary. A must read for anyone who has always known something's a little off about tithing. Giving yes, tithing legalistically to the church, NO!"
1,Not for beginners at all...,"If you don't already know the names of the poses and know how to get into them instantly, then don't purchase this video. The instructor speaks very fast and I had a hard time understanding what he was saying. Also, there was no explanation as to how to get into a pose and I had to keep looking at the television to see if I was doing it correctly (ignoring my breathing because there was no time for it) and by the time I got into what I thought was the correct pose, he was already changing poses in a fast manner. In less than five minutes, I had to shut it off and sit in child's pose to breathe slowly and collect my racing thoughts. I am pleased to say that I was promptly issued a refund."
4,Well done!,I've been doing Pilates for years. I wanted to try something different. So I went for this Yoga video. I was not disappointed. My biggest beef (being a guy) is the overly medically enhanced women that show up in lots of fitness videos and instructors that go so fast you struggle to keep up with them. This has neither. It features both a guy and girl (neither of which that I can tell have been overly medically enhanced) and both regular and advanced moves. I was/am very pleasantly surprised at how well this was done!
2,Not For Beginners,"I am new to yoga and I found this video difficult to use. The audio and video quality are mediocre. The speaker talks too fast and does not describe the poses well. The video was shot at a bit of a distance making it difficult to see the detail what the instructors are doing, such as how they place their feet and hands."
5,A Spiritual Classic,"The Problem of God is a deceptive book. Slight in pages, it presents as a modest group of lectures on Biblical experiences of God. In fact, the book may well represent one of the most profound meditations on God and man's reaction to God produced by the modern church. I first read this book while in seminary. I find that I return to its insights again and again."
2,a little disappointed,"I am getting German lessons from a friend who is from Austria. I thought this CD would be good to get my 15 month old daughter started also, but it was a real disappointment. I had my Austrian friend take a look at it and she said that some of the words on the teaching guide have wrong spelling and others are not words that are used when talking to babies.Overall it is something you could get free online. The numbers and colours are good to know, but then again, you can get that online for free."
5,KitchenAid Pasta Attachments,"The product fits all KitchenAid stand mixers and requires the food grinder attachment. It permits the user to make many kinds of fresh pasta quickly. Make sure your dough mixture isn't too dry, or the plastic pieces might break."
5,Perfect,Exactly what I wanted and was at a fantastic price. I will use this a lot and absolutely love it.
4,Kitchenaid pasta makers,"I bought this for my wife (she wanted to try making her own pasta & ravioli). Everything worked great, but it took just a little practice to get the hang of the ravioli maker."
5,Great Product,"This product makes homemade pasta easy and delicious, a must have for the home cook. You can make the dough in your mixer, then just attach the roller and make your sheets, then cut. I really like the fact I can make the sheets the thickness that I like and there are many cut size options.The only downside is you can only roll out a small amount of dough at a time so it's a bit time consuming but well worth. Haven't used the ravioli attachment and it does tell you in the directions to take a practice run or two first so sounds a little complex."
5,Amazing,these attachments have made this single dad into a pasta making pro in no time! There is no comparison between fresh and store bought pasta. My picky eater son is constantly asking for seconds and thirds!!
1,"Cheesy orchestral disco-jazz, with some unexpected greatness","What is going on in the lowlands? This is the second of 2 recordings I have heard which feature great saxophonists in front of a Danish orchestral big band (the other being Ronnie Cuber's ""Love For Sale""), and both of them are so cheesey they'd give Wallace & Gromit lactose intolerance. Stan Getz plays with his typical late-period eloquence and assuredness, and occasionally manages to lift the level of this music to acceptable. Most of the time, however, he is bogged down behind a barrage of synthesizers and violins that simply offend the senses. For those Getz completists out there, knock yourself out. Everybody else - run far, far away."
5,The Thinking Person's Tom Clancy,"Don't miss this. I work in the ""industry"" and this work is accurate, timely and frightening.It's not ""if""...but ""when""......"
4,Listen To This!,"A retrospective of Acid Jazz, CD #1 is really a meditation on why musicians love & revere 1970's soul. Its worth the price of admission to hear ""Sunship"", described in the liner notes as influenced by Herbie Hancock. House Divas will wonder (and mourn!) when we heard it last at the Paradise Garage. God rest & bless your soul, Larry Levan! Mother Earth gives a credible nod on ""Apple Green"", trippy and soulful, to the Isley Brothers via AWB, Stephen Bishop, & other blue-eyed soul crooners. Yes, back when blue-eyed soul did not mean Boy Bands from the Mall of America. I've worn a groove in ""Apple Green""...if grooves can be worn in digital media. CD #2 warrants being CD #2. That is to say I've listened to it several times and wished (on even more occasions) that it was part of another collection. Its o.k., but its uneven not nearly as riveting as the first CD. Buy this and groove around your apartment."
2,Absolute Copy,It's an easy job to make us feel good about ourselves. Mister Pino succeed's in doing that as he succeeds to copy old theories from NLP and predestination. The only destination for this book is in the toilet or to my beloved mother in law.
5,Good insights from a good man,"Robert's book offers some powerful insights into the nature of people and, how they can control their lives.Robert is a man who cares very much about people - and thrives on helping them grow to their potential.His warm and caring nature are reflected in the pages of his acheivement. A real gem with insights at every turn."
5,Absolute Victory is a book with depth,My friend recommended Absolute Victory to me and I thank her! Pino strikes a cord with every insight about life. Each time when I pick up this book and read it again it gives me new insights that I just need at the very moment. The book is a hologram of life. Worthwhile!
5,Great Book!!!!,"Must Pick This one up, it is a great book and will keep your on th edge of your seat and wanting more. The Storyline is good and everything is put together just right for an interesting, but easy reading experience. Great book for road trips and ""pick up"" reading."
1,Doesn't work!!!,"I bought this and sent it back that day, it wouldn't work on my computer or my car or I tried my home Cd player and nothing. They sent me a new one and guess what...still doesn't work!!!! A waste!!"
5,Best collection ever!,"If you enjoy classical music, then this is the set for you. It includes the best pieces from all periods of Western Classical music. I played many of these pieces in my high school orchestra. It is nice hearing them all in one collection."
4,Sounds good to me.,"Bought this CD to calm and relax myself after a hard days work. CD seems like a great collection to me. It's got a lot of songs that I recognize and some that I don't. It does sooth me a bit after the the many stresses of everyday life.I'm not really a classical music nut like ""Frasier Crane"" so I'm not sure how much merit I can bring to the table with this review. But I think it's great..!!!"
4,Tickled Pink,"I recently received this set as a gift, and I can't describe how excited I was. It's a great little set, and the pieces included are varied. I loved the inclusion of the Hallelujah Chorus (my family, however, is less enthused due to my excitedly singing along) but missed such pieces as the 1812 Overture and Flight of the Valkyrie. I am not a person learned in music, I am more familiar with the commonly-played, recognizable by the masses music, but the opportunity to become familiar with different pieces here is truly a gift."
3,They are OK,"These gloves are OK. I bought them 2 years ago here in Amazon and have use them quite few times. They are good though a bit uncomfortable.If you are not playing pro, these are more than fine."
3,Relaxing but ...,The nature sounds are ok but somehow they dont feel natural. The streams sound rather like computer generated.
1,Looks good but...,I bought one for my team but it was slow - lost a minute or two every couple of days. I returned it and got another - same deal. Buy one if you don't need it to be accurate and don't mind resetting it a couple of time a week.
1,The Absolute Worst Thing I Have Ever Read,"I have been reviewing books for some time, but I have to say this is the absolute worst thing I have ever read. The author (and I use that term VERY loosely) apparently had a bitter divorce and has used his anger toward the ex-wife as a means to debase all women.The arrogance is astounding. From the misogynistic thread that runs rampant throughout the text to the obvious cruelty, it is truly a sad commentary on where we have gone as a society."
1,Sad,Ditto. Arrogance is definitely the right word when describing this text. I thought the caveman mentality went out with leg warmers. It makes me ashamed to be a man when I see garbage like this floating around.
4,Compelling Mess,"The fact that WICKETT's REMEDY is readable and often compelling proves Ms. Goldberg's talent as a writer. The book simply put is a mess comprised of straight narrative, letters, period newspaper clippings, comments from the ""dead"" that run along the book's margins, newsletters, brochures and memos. Time shifts haphazardly and it's not always clear where Ms. Goldberg is going with either plot or theme. Still, by some magic a coherent informative story emerges for the patient reader. The ending is not satisfactory since too many storylines are left unfinished and the book just seems to stop. Even though the book is set during a flu epidemic and many sympathetic characters meet tragic ends, WICKETT'S REMEDY is a more positive and hopeful book than Ms. Goldberg's previous book BEE SEASON which was an utterly depressing look at family dysfunction and insanity tossed with some mysticism."
2,Was there a plot?,"While ""Wickett's Remedey"" was very readable and engaging, I found myself wondering when the book was going to come into focus. It seemed to have no ending, just an end. I was very dissapointed. I did; however, enjoy the marginal comments by the dead. I thought that was very original and insightful. I would try another of her books."
1,A Disappointing Read,"While this novel was on a subject that I usually find rather interesting, I found the work itself to be lacking. The ""whisperings"" in the margins only distract the reader and provide little to no substance to the work. Additionally, the subplot involving the origin of the popular soda recipe could have been better developed. Overall, I would not recommend this book unless you really are sick and stuck on the couch, but even then it won't make you feel much better."
3,A bit thin,"I am ambivalent about Wickett's Remedy. (I read the paperback. I understand she rewrote it from the hard cover edition.) I enjoyed the historical setting. Myla Godberg did a good job of evoking the period of the Influenza epidemic. I got a good sense for the setting as well and could well accept her premise. The margin notes were, I thought, one of the most clever and effective literary devices I've encountered. Wish I'd thought of it!However, there was something about the way the threads of this story were woven together that was unsatisfying. Or perhaps it is that they weren't, in fact, woven together very well. I wonder if, having set the stage for this complicated novel, she struggled to make it work. And then, suddenly, it was just over. As I said - unsatisfying. It wasn't a bad book, but it wasn't all that great."
2,"Creative, but confusing","There are numerous delightful aspects to this novel, especially the attention to historical detail and the ingenious ""whisperings"" in the margins.Unfortunately, Goldberg has added so many different strands that the ultimate work doesn't hang together well. There are too many different story lines, and as a result I found myself ignoring one that later proved relevant, and distracting by the irrelevant story of QD Soda. It was unfortunate, because the central themes, the story of Lydia Wickett in 1917-18, the Gallups Island experiment, and the role of memory and history, were all wonderful. They just got buried under the weight of all the other strands. If QD Soda had been edited out, one might have been able to appreciate the newspaper articles and other tidbits; as it was, it became an overly busy patchwork, hard to appreciate much of anything."
2,Remedy Lacks Great Original Ingredients,"Goldberg's first novel, Bee Season, was one of the best firsts I'd read in years. Instead of sticking with what worked beautifully the first time around, Goldberg resorted to a couple of clunky contrivances to spoil the formula in Wickett's Remedy. The novel starts out strong, with interesting characters and a compelling historical story line. Sadly, the interruptions of Goldberg's annoying margin commentary and the inscrutable QD Soda newsletter provide nothing more than a distraction. And by the end of the novel, even the story line gives out, stranded along with the protagonist, Lydia Wickett, on an island where both the good work she hopes to do and the story Goldberg begins with such promise amount to nothing much."
3,not engaging,"I loved Myla Goldberg's Bee Season and eagerly awaited her next novel. Unfortunately, Wickett's Remedy is clever at best. (I can't speak of the whole book, only of the first several chapters which I read). The main character Lydia seems strangely passive and passionless in response to her suitor's odd but successful courtship. The tone faintly suggests, ""She is just a character in a novel""; everything seems like a clever device, or an opening for a clever device. The prose is somewhat belabored. I had to stutter-read, returning to the same sentence twice, to absorb the information it conveyed. Too bad that I couldn't just be ""absorbed"" as I was by Bee Season."
3,This is the 2nd volume!!!,"NOTE: This is the second volume, not the entire book. You either need to order the first volume, as well, or order the entire textbook from another website. I'm disappointed that Amazon doesn't seem to have the first volume or the entire book available. I've never had any problems ordering and getting the correct textbook from Amazon until now. This isn't exactly the seller's fault that I got the wrong book, but they should note in the title that this is the second volume, so buyers realize this and make sure they are ordering the correct materials."
5,Delivered Just as Described,This book was delivered in a timely manner and was just as described in the solicitation to buy. It even appears to be autographed though that was not mentioned in the product description.
1,See a Doctor,I had severe Back and leg pain and took this product with no relief. I got an MRI which showed a lumbar disk causing nerve pressure.If you experience Sciatica type pains go see a spine Doctor as you possibly have a herinated disk.
1,WTF?,"Disappointing, lacking consistancy and flow, too much going on in regards to style, no focus.Why?I pity the fool that buys this."
4,good stuff,"Too bad they aren't around any more! They were a cool band, aside from the fact that the lyrics to almost all of the songs were all about how awesome the singer is."
5,Crayon Soap -- Very Fruity and Fun!,"I think that the other reviewers are missing the point and being very hopeful. First, the description clearly states that these are SOAPS -- not crayons. Second, I don't think it's fair to complain that the soaps didn't provide ""hours"" of fun in the tub. Who leaves their kids in the tub for ""hours"" at a time, anyway!For us, these are great soaps. The little ones around here think they're fun because they are very fragrant and the colors make the bath water tinted. Frankly, for me, anything that keeps them in the tub longer makes my job of getting them clean easier!I like these soaps a lot and the little ones do too! You should also try the bubble bath. That's a BIG hit around here. All the Canus products are..."
2,Not that much fun.,"The product description says, ""For hours of fun in the tub, bathe and play..."". I don't know how a child is supposed to play with these 'crayon soaps'. Although the description does not say the crayons draw on the tub, we assumed that 'hours of play with crayon soaps' meant we could draw on the tub. My daughter played with them the first time and said they were broke. Now on the up side the scents are good and they do create a very nice lather for washing. But I would not recommend this product if you want 'play time'."
3,Comics.,"For people who read comic books, you'll love this movie. Filled with great fighting sequences, this movie is lacking any plot really. As the title reveals no plot either, this is a beat 'em up movie. There are some noteworthy, bordering on legendary actors in this movie, has English 5.1 version, excellent presentation. As I said, it lacks any good story or plot. Also it is not real martial arts, but computer animation sequences mostly. Not a bad movie for fans, otherwise not too memorable for martial arts lovers."
4,"Fun, action-packed martial arts film with pretty boys kicking butt!","Awesome martial arts choreography, matched with characters you do grow to care about, this film - if you sort of check your brain at the door, and just have fun with it - is one of the most way-cool ways to spend two hours. Two brothers, separated from the martial arts training school they lived in when the older one was forced to leave with his mother, grow up on the opposite sides of good and evil (so to speak) ... until the ultimate challenge of a very powerful bad guy may just be what brings them together again, if they're going to take him down for good."
5,Dragon tiger gate,I enjoyed the movie but the dub part it failed to meet my expectations like most movies that gets transferred into English from a different language. Which ruined some of the movie for me but other then that I loved it.
5,"Amazing, Must HAVE!!!","For those who never seen this movie, prepare to be amaze [...] Not to mention seeing them get kicked flying up in the air like popping popcorn. 3 guys each with their own fighting techniques show some cool kung fu fighting styles. If you really like fighting movie, this is the movie for you or perhaps anybody.. I gotta say this is my favorite movie, even though I got mine in 2007 with english subbed. Trust me, I am really picky at good movie!!!!"
4,Dragon Tiger Gate,"Normally, when I watched a movie of this style, I never take it seriously whether it is real or how's about story. I only take it as relaxibly to be entertained of its action. However, despite the content of the movie which is, for me, I think it is worst of all other Chinese kung-fu movies, but I really enjoyed the quality of image of this movie from BD as well as the sound quality of DTS-HD 7.1 channels, better than other wester movies of this kind."
4,crouching hidden dragon tiger,"I like this new generation of martial films because the older ones got boring and cliche. Although i hate high flying CGI crap but this is a bit more on-the-ground fighting. It has a Matrix appeal because of the special effects such as the hard hitting punches or kicks that knocks the opponent through a wall or floor. It is very fast-paced in action. The storyline is great, especially the ""flashback"" scenes that gave it some depth. Ususally kungfu films have alot more action and less substance but in this film it is balanced. Thank god it didn't have a storyline where the good guys have to save a kidnapped girl. I gave it four stars because it didn't get in depth with the supporting characters as i was hoping. Overall, i rented it and bought it the same day and i don't regret it."
3,Decent blu-ray of a decent comic book movie...,"not a lot of 3-D pop, but good audio. Taking into consideration that this is based on a comic book, the fighting is exaggerated but fun. if you like this movie, then the blu-ray is the best version out there as of this writing. the AVS blu-ray tier forum has this correctly placed in its list as a silver or B+ placement in PQ/AQ."
5,Dragon Tiger Gate,"I gotta say this is one of THE BEST martial arts movies of all time... man if you like Donnie Yen's movies, then I guarantee, that this one is gonna impress you even more. one of Donnie Yen's BEST EVER MADE... I love the fight scenes and the story is just as good as the fights... I would recomend this to everyone who like Donnie Yen's movie collections. this is a ""Must Have"" movie...just love it."
4,Dragon Tiger Gate (Blu Ray},Dragon Tiger Gate [Blu-ray] Excellent fight scenes. Beautifully filmed and executed. the sound track is great. I saw this on dvd originally and couldn't wait to own it on Blu Ray. If you decide to give it a peek do get the Blu Ray disc. It is well worth buying and owning.
3,Dragon Tiger Gate (Special Edition),1st time I play this video the sound was so bad that even with the volume all the way up I could barely hear it. 2nd time sound was ok & the dialogue was in English so I understood what was being said. 3rd time I watched all is in some oriental language so I can no longer understand what they are saying? Be care when ordering this with keeping in mind the problems I have provided for you to be aware of here. I read several review Before buying this video & all pretty much said the same thing that I am saying here!
4,Fun!! Just bring a little suspension of disbelief.,"I loved the teahouse fight scene. The camera play was hilarious. Throughout the movie, the aesthetic design of various scenes were quite impressive.The only criticism I have for this movie is the heroes' hair. I know, I have to keep reminding myself that they are all based on comic book characters, therefore they can all have exactly the same haircut along with names like ""Dragon,"" ""Tiger,"" & ""Turbo."" But I could only take the suspension of disbelief so far. It ended right at the hair.One last gem: in the last fight scene there is one profile shot of ""Dragon"" as he extends his right arm & points at the Bad Guy. His musculature was exceptional, even to my bodybuilder brother on the next couch. In subsequent shots, it appeared that that was not Photoshopped. Good game, Donnie."

1,Dragon Tiger Gate,"Dragon Tiger Gate is based on a martial arts comic book of the same title popular in the seventies and eighties.I rate this movie at one star as it might be of interest to fans of Donnie Yuen and/or fans of martial arts. If you are neither, then steer well clear. Dragon Tiger Gate just has all the bad parts of Hong Kong Cinema including a script so bad that it ruins the whole endeavour."
1,unhappy,"My order delivered fairly quickly, but when I received it I could not watch the movie. I did receive a refund."
4,Armchair Travel,"Fernie and his best friend are world travelers in this book of poetry. Each poem is approximately 1 page long, and is about a different world location - San Francisco, Japan, Australia, Kenya, etc. I felt that the book captured a bit of each place through the poems, and that they were humorous and fun as well. For someone with an interest in poetry, geography, travel, or humor, this book would be a great gift idea or introduction to these topics. I generally dislike reading poetry but was drawn into this book because of the cute drawings and theme of travel. It was quite a nice read, although the final page - about California geography didn't seem to fit. Recommended."
5,rugged shakespeare,I had an overpriced Arden Shakespeare copy of the play. The spine broke. I have known Oxford was as good for lower price and prefer the notes. The Arden text is more authoritative but the physical (Oxford) book is better.
2,Big-Don's Review of a Shakespeare Classic,"This story was, as the name suggests, a tragedy. This was one of Shakespeares' more weak works. I recommend this for only the real ""die-hard"" Shakespeare fan, but for the rest of you, I would pass."
4,"Can't rank it with his best, but still a worthy read.","With its scenes of war and mobs, CORIOLANUS is a work best expirienced on the stage, of course, being one of his least popular plays, it doesn't get produced too often.The only killing Coriolanus does is on the battle field, but he still comes off as a much less likable character than the murdering Hamlet or Macbeth because Coriolanus spends much of the play berating the citizens of Rome. CORIOLANUS has often been called Shakespeare's manifesto against democracy because of this, but the play is much more complex than that. Yes, it's a play about the fickleness of the masses, but it's also about leaders who don't perform their responsibilities either.The play is much more political than emotional, and therefore not one I'll return to often, but its political statements are as timely today as they were 400 years ago, if not moreso."
1,Not for Kindle,"The commentary is modern and relevant, and the play itself is a masterwork: it challenges the audience directly with the character of Gaius Martius Coriolanus, who derives his being from war. It is a very great play, worthy of long and careful study. But the Kindle edition is essentially unreadable: it's impossible to tell the length of lines, since all is presented in scarcely differentiated blocks of text which, alarmingly, change sizes are you're reading. There are no notes to explain terms. The apparatus considered essential for modern readers is lost in the transition to Kindle format. (Try to find any act-scene-line combination: it's almost impossible). The Kindle is pretty slick, but the formatting of Shakespeare's play is beond this device. Buy the paperback; or let me know if you find a Kindle-compatible version that preserve stage direction, notes on the text, and the proper division of lines."
1,Gave me a rash,if you have sensitive skin dont even try it - I like the smell but it gave me a rash and does not work
1,Hampton!,"Browse this website for Lionel Hampton, find the detail page of a CD that interests you and even sports his picture, order it, when you get it, find out that LH had no part in this recording, which is just by some other group playing his pieces. This is what'll happen to you if you order this CD. Be warned. My ""one-star"" rating was only given because, apparently, there's no way of rating in the negative."
4,Does the job,It does the job and is very sturdy and very simple to put up and take down. But it is VERY heavy at over 50lbs so not portable.
1,Music for Right Wingers,"Jeff Steele is a right wing, reactionary, judgmental type Christian. The lyrics of his songs reflect that attitude. Also, the vocals are boring. Their unison is poor and their blend is not good.If you want really good Southern Gospel music, leave this one alone. Go get something by the Gaither Vocal Band or the Palmetto State Quartet. If you wanted mixed vocals try the Hoppers or the McKameys. Those groups are all better vocally, and they have a better attitude."
4,Touchdown!,"""Heading into next week's showdown"" I just bought copies for prizes for my superbowl party - I know it will be a ""slam dunk."""
5,Pastoral - another great book by Nevil Shute,"I just can't stop reading Shute's books! And Pastoral was another terrific book! Although I was a so-called post-war baby, born after WWII in 1951, I never made the connection between my birth and the war years. Pastoral gave me insight into the years just prior to my birth. I enjoyed the flying that was woven into this story. Pastoral takes one to the brink of disaster and then ... well, read the book!"
3,Great book!,"""From an Oxfordshire air base, Wellington bombers fly missions into Germany. Only a handful of crews have survived the war long enough to become experienced. Peter Marshall is captain of one crew. When he falls in love with Gervase, her rebuff nearly costs him his concentration and life. Their relationship blossoms when he has only five more missions to go. As they tick by, tension mounts."
3,Sea Wolf,"The Sea wolf was a well written story of a writer in San Francisco named Humphrey. He was swept overboard a ferry and was rescued by a ship called The Ghost and for months dealt with the hardships of a violently abusive captain and untrusting seal hunters. But he also learned the way of sea life and how to stand on his own two feet for once. I found this book a pretty good read because of the story line and how this one character survived being on the ship with such a raw and violent captain. The only thing that I found hard to comprehend was the advanced vocabulary when the main character would describe something or someone, just because I didn’t know many of the words and it made me lose my spot in some parts. Other than the diction I thought the book was a well written novel about sea life and love."
4,Not His Best but very entertaining,"This book differs somewhat from London's other novels. One thing that is great for a younger reader is that the book is written through the main character's perspective, which makes understanding him easier for the reader. The events that occur in the first 100 pages come fast one after the other leaving the reader wondering what could possibly come next, and then to me as well as some other reviewers the novel begins to slow down especially with the entrance of the female. Overall the story is great and the characters are easy to understand, and London's writing style makes it simple to enjoy."
2,Not what I expected,"I didn't know anything about Jack London or The Sea Wolf, but I knew the story was set in a nautical setting so I decided to read it. The story started off very exciting but then slowed down to a near crawl for most of the middle. There never was really any climax what so ever; I was looking for it the entire book but never found it. The plot was very predictable. I knew exactly what would happen the entire time which really ruined it for me. The ending was very cheesy and predictable. The protagonist is basically a wuss, and his extremely feminine viewpoint and talking style quickly became irritating. The book is LITTERED with nautical and sailing terms and half the time I didn't know what the narrator was talking about. The book isn't the best read I've experienced. I'll probably be staying away from Jack London from now on."
4,A good tale,"Other reviewers have given plenty of descriptions, so I won't bother. Suffice it to say it was a good story about a man finding himself under harsh conditions."
2,This book is boring............,"I have to read this book for summer vacation. I didn't think that this book is long but this book, at the start out, is extremely boring. I have absolutely no idea what the people or characters in the books were saying. I hardly went through the first page before my brain started to ask in confusion with the question, ""what""? I seriously would not recommend this book for students under 16."
2,Seawolf,"My son needed this book for assigned reading at school. The book quality itself is as with any new book, perfect. As for the story line, like I said, it was assigned reading. Jack London has written some classic stories, but I can't say they are considered to be among the books that your child ""just can't put down"" while reading.. (except for the fact that we won't let them put it down until they are done with the assignment) My son is in 6th grade, but I believe this book is most likely for 8th grade or higher when given as assigned reading for school, since he goes to a gifted school. They typically read books 2 - 3 grade years ahead in his classes. It will go on the book shelf in our home library among the classics, though not among the most cherished for enjoyment."
1,This book stunk!,"This book was pointless and was a waste of time. Larsen places no value in life. The discussions of this book make it a deep, boring, can't keep your eyes open book. Stay away from this one. The summary calls it an adventure when the most exciting thing they did was sit in front of each other and sharpen knives."
1,Horrible,"If I could give this book 0 stars I would. It is boring and irritating. The pointlessness baffels me, I couldn't stand picking it up and trying to force myself to finish it. Whenever I would stop reading it for a while I would find myself extremely depressed. I do not recomend this book."
2,Ughh,"Let me say that again: ughh.A good book, all told, but exceedingly dull and almost impossible to get through. Apparently, Jack London's writing style does not suit me."
4,"now that's what I call ""writing.""",The Sea Wolf is a real classic. Jack London could put some amazingly descriptive sentences together.
4,Sea Encounters,"An excallent novel filled with great adventure. It has a classic story of an intimidating Captain, a rowdy crew, and a rich man turned cabin boy. They encounter many interesting situations while on their coyage the the seal hunting site. I highly recommend this novel if you have already read White Fang."
5,In Case You Think This Is Outdated....,"This book will never be outdated because it captures the unchanging face of human archetypes that have pervaded stories of all cultures in all times. These characters are people we know, or would like to know, or have already known. Plot and structure advance the story and strengthen the on going themes and subplot. I will not divulge more here except to say that even John Wayne who played Wolf Larsen in the film version looks small next to the actual character. Get this book; do not miss this book."
5,Great adventure story!,"What a great adventure story. I skimmed a bit on the philosophical parts, but overall I loved the story."
4,Intelligent met the brutal,"I actually enjoyed reading this book. This story played out well through a voyage across the sea towards Japan in search of seal skins. The author did well with presenting drama, a villain, a hero and a good love story. I gave four stars because there were some drawn out parts of the book, but not so much that it took away from the character of the book. I would recommend this book."
5,The Sea Wolf,"OUTSTANDING!!!! Couldn't put it down. Having spent five years in our modern Navy even I had some difficulty with the nautical terms from so long ago but was able to get passed that because of the extraordinary writing. The narration angle was awesome, the characters very exciting, the event and scenery projected into my mind as I went from page to page was riveting. With all that, the most amazing thing about this book is that Mr. London could write an entire book about life at sea with a deranged captain and dinghy crew, actually draw you into that small vessel as if you were living, working, eating and sailing with those men, and yet not a single profane word. A superb classic for readers of any age, my only regret is I didn't read it years ago."
3,Solid adventure story.,It has been many years since I've read any Jack London and it was good to get back in the adventure story groove. He does paint a good visual in one's mind of the settings even with the 19th century language. The story moves along pretty well although some of the flowery romantic speech seem to drag for me. The conclusion was sufficiently satisfying and it is suitable reading for young readers.
1,It was not well written and the plot did not develop well.,The book was boring and did not hold my interest
5,concretizes Gandhi's ideas,"I liked this book because it makes Gandhi's ideas concrete and specific. He talks about how to handle specific situations, and explains his thinking - for example, his view of picketing. Specific examples of how to handle specific situations give you more insight into what non-violent resistence and non-cooperation really mean as applied to real life situations. After reading this book, you have a much better sense of how to apply Gandhi's ideas, versus just an overview of his ideas as abstraction."
5,Gandhi,I helped a high school student write a research paper about how Gandhi's method of nonviolent resistance freed India from the british. The teacher loved it and had her present it to the whole class. She got an A on the paper and in the class. Great background for the Jewel in the Crown PBS series.
2,Interesting story but lacks punch,"Take this same plot and put it in the hands of a talent such as James Lee Burke or Earl Emerson and you would have the makings of a masterpiece. Unfortunately this author's skill is not quite up to his imagination. It surely isn't the worst writing I've come across, not by a long stretch; in fact, it's good enough that I would strongly encourage the author to continue working at his craft, with some emphasis on character development, story arc and avoiding cliches. I am not averse to buying another book from this author, particularly if the author works on these issues."
5,Great series,"I really enjoy this series and have the first two sets of the travels already. Fun to watch and see the ""real"" America"
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money on this product. I can't recommend them because the fabric isn't stretchy enough to give that nice sexy contour and for the same reason they are not comfortable. For some strange reason they also have two layers of fabric. This is quite unnecessary since one reason to wear thongs is to reveal a bit more than regular underwear and therefore it's nice if they are slightly see thru.
5,A Must-Have Overview Of Airpower's Hardware History,"I'll try to avoid repeating what everybody else has said so far, but add to the discussion the fact that the volume here is a newer edition of the ""Rand McNally Encyclopedia of Military Aircraft"" from the Eighties, updated to the end of the past Century with new material about aircraft from the Eighties and Nineties."
4,The Ultimate Military Aviation Reference,"A must for aviation enthusiasts. I've got several dated editions of Angellucci's aviation reference books. I think no aviation enthusiast should be without a copy of this most excellent reference book. The color pictures come to life, and it is packed with relavent statistics, data, and pull-charts which are teeming with information. The only criticism I have is that after glancing through this most recent edition in a book store... it doesn't seem to have any new aircraft. The Joint Strike Fighter and the F-22 Raptor come to mind."
3,A 3.5 rating,"The two main positives, to me, are the characters and their relationships with each other and those around them, and the sense of place created by the author. When he describes riding through deep, freezing snow, I'm ready to reach for a blanket. But the best thing is that this is a good, basic, who-dun-it mystery. I shall definitely keep following this series."
3,Average book,"While this book is not terrible, it is simply average. I will not be reading any of the other books in the series. I bought this book b/c I enjoy mysteries and enjoy the time period. Disappointing."
3,Not convinced that this is actually good for you but it works!!!,I have had problems with my digestion for years. I was a Renew Life user for a while and went on the internet to see what else was available. I tried this and the way it works on me is mostly erruptive! But it does seem to work. Not sure this is such a healthy way to expel what is building up in the intestine but it feels better than the alternative.
1,not all they said it was,"I did just what the directions said and all the cleanse did is give me the runs, not uncontrollable. I did not see anything abnormal or feel like it was doing what it claimed it does. For the money an expensive laxative!!!"
1,Didn't work for me,Either my bowels are in better shape than I thought or the product does not work for me. Basically caused my stomach to churn for 8 hours then out came water. I was afraid to use this on days I work because my position will not allow me to run to the restroom every 2 hours.
1,side effects and non-responsive seller,"This product made me feel alarmingly ill at the dose recommended, causing me to have safety concerns about which I will do some research of my own. You might want to beware of this seller --initially they not respond to my email at all, then upon sending 2 more, asking about the satisfaction guaranteed policy, they finally responded saying that once you have opened it they will not consider refunding (even though the Oxy Powder company has a money back guarantee). After that they did not reply at all to further questions on my part."
1,stay close to the bathroom,"I bought oxy-powder with hi hopes, but just taking the first 4 pills gave me constant wet stools, I had diarrhea all the time, just fluid, no solid stools"
2,Does not work,"This product did not at all. Once I started to use it, I began to become constipated, and had to use a laxitive to get a bowel movement. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Total waste of money..........,Total waste of money..........Oxy-Powder Colon Cleanse.......does zero nothing like throwing money in the trash...Did nothing for me....my work for others but not me!~
4,Gurgle Gurgle,"I use this product all the time. I only gave 4 stars because a few years ago I noticed a change in the way it reacted with my body. Loud gurgles started happening that could be heard from across the room. Never did this before, so I looked at the bottle and noticed the lable was different. So I compared the ingredients with an older one I had and noticed they were not exactly the same. When I called Oxy-Powder they said nothing had changed. So now I try to live with the LOUD Gurgles from within me, and sometimes giggles of small children.....So, it works- Just liked it better without the noises."
1,Complete waste of money,"This product is a complete waste of money. It does nothing more than a normal laxative can do, however the side effects are a lot worse. This product causes severe bloating and cramping. As the manufacturer tells you, it also causes loose stools. Don't expect to travel far from a bathroom while you use this product -- you need to have it close by at all times, as your ability to hold your bowel movements in for longer than 30 seconds will be extremely compromised. Also, if you have a work out routine -- completely forget about doing it while on Oxy Powder -- you will not be able to work out for longer than 5 minutes without running to the bathroom. This is a complete waste of money."
2,Laxative,"This is an expensive laxative. You will get the same results with cheaper options like Swiss Kriss, Miralax, magnesium citrate or eating handfuls of Concord grapes."
4,Oxy powder does what it promises,"I was afraid to start the oxy powder because I had never done a cleanse before, but it was just as the product stated. Take 4 capsules and 8 oz of water before bed. The next day it worked just as stated - (liquified stools). After a few days I had to increase the dosage to get the same amount of ""movements"" a day. After I finished my cleanse, I continued to be regular.Make sure you get up early so you have enough time to take care of business- you get warning but not too much.I will use to keep regular- I would recommend to people with regularity issues."
4,"weird stuff, but it works for me","I've suffered from constipation for several years, even gone 3 weeks before with no bowel movement at all! and after trying pretty much everything ( Colonix, Natures Secret Super Cleanse, Fiber formulas, colon hydrotherapy, cascara, senna, aloe lax, Natural Calm etc. etc.) this is the product that is helping me the most. I don't get any more cramping or other discomfort than I did with senna or cascara, and every day I get rid of a little more than the previous b.m. My situation was caused by cassein and gluten intolerance, which I just recently discovered. Also tension is a culprit, massage can help. And my toxicity headaches went away after replacing my old silver fillings in my teeth. There is a significant amount of mercury in those. There's my experiences with this abdominal curse, hope it helps someone!"
5,The best out there... Amazing results,"I had tried a couple of products and normally do not bother to write reviews. After taking this product as described, I had to come and write a review for this one. I works wonders. Let me put it this way: It works the way it says it will. I did feel the difference and would higly recommend this to anyone who wants to reclaim their health and vitality. I followed this with the Cayce apple diet a couple of weeks later(http://www.areclinic.org/articles.asp?articleid=62) and the results were amazing in my case. I am (was) healthy and do exercise atleast 3to4 days a week, 5' 10"" and 165lb before doing this. After this and the apple diet, my weight dropped to 153lb. For a person who was not even thinking/planning on losing weight, that is awesome results and a super bonus :-). As I said I was healthy before I undertook this and after this, I feel a lot lighter and cleaner and even more healthier....."
5,This stuff really works.......,"Oxy-powder is different from all other cleanse products out there. This does not have bulky fiber or herbs. It's just a few simple ingredients, and it works sometimes in a hour, and without a mess. Very smooth. If you take too much then your bowels will liquefy, so take a capsule or two to test for your needs. And also Amazon has the best price if you comparison shop."
1,Horrible side effects,"I've been taking Oxy Powder for 3 days, following all the prescribed recommendations (including the healthy diet). I don't know how it works for other people, but for me it causes a very obvious diarrhea. It makes me go to the restroom a couple of hours after I eat anything, I clearly see the pieces of what I ate in what comes out. I feel dehydrated (in spite of drinking lots of water), dizzy, and have a very bad headache. Will not take it any more and will call them tomorrow to request a refund.This bad experience also made me browse for medical research article on colon cleansing. Surprisingly, I could not find any.... On the contrary, it seems that our colon is typically nice, pink and clean, and no doctors or pathologists have ever observed a mucous plaque or anything of this kind. So I am not sure whether to trust the whole industry of colon cleansing products in general..."
1,A Waste of Money and a Trip to the Doctor,"I took this about a year ago, and I almost ended up in the emergency room. I was stuck in the bathroom at work for at least 15 mintues, with cramps that were so severe, I couldn't even STAND UP and pull up my pants.I went directly to my doctor's office when the cramps subsided- afraid I had done permanent damage by being stupid enough to take these pills. (and I took the recommended dosage). Luckily, the cramps didn't come back and I threw away the remaining pills."
3,"Works, but overpriced","I gave this product 3 stars because although it does what it advertises, Oxypowder is really nothing but an overpriced laxative you could buy at your local drugstore.Tried this out and did the 7 day cleanse per the directions. It definitely did what it advertised. Wasn't horrible to where I had to run to the bathroom all day, but I definitely went a lot more than usual, and I DID feel better afterwards.However... all it really consists of is magnesium oxide. You can buy magnesium oxide pills at a vitamin shop for WAY less the price... and at least for me, it has the same affect. Magnesium citrate does as well."
1,AVOID!!!,"I ignored the bad reviews. Now I realize my mistake. Oxy-Powder is not for everybody, and has the potential of making you very sick. Not worth it."
1,Not what I expected,"I followed the directions exactly and the day after I started I was living in the bathroom with water running out of me. Not sure why, but I stopped because I couldn't be confined to my house and bathroom. I tried it again some months later, and again, the same thing. Needless to say, I got very frustrated and threw these away."
2,no lo recomiendo,take it for two days caused me not continue to take more. just got gas and diarrhea. expect otherwise. not recommended at all. very disappointed. The page says you'll have loose stools but I almost defecated water.
5,GREAT Product,"Amazing product, work as advertised. Well worth the price, and has made significant improvements in my family's colon health. Have suggested to many friends!"
5,I lost 10 pounds!!,"This product is great!!! With my own diet I lost 30 pounds and the forth month with oxy powder I lost the last 10 from size 16 to size 8. Now it has been 1 year again I again 15 pounds, I am trying to loose at least 10, again, and this product do it pain less and quickly. After this experience you do not only loose weight, you fill lighter and skin feels smooth like a baby. Drink all the water you may can. I recommend it 100%"
5,"The best, and only product that doesn't cause cramps or side effects!","I have been a once a week person for my whole life. (more than 50 years) I have tried over the counter solutions, prescriptions, high fiber with lots of water, I did it all. This is the only product to use. I have done the cleanse once and would like to do it again. I take this product once or twice a week and feel great."
4,Seems very effective for some,"I was really excited about getting this product based on other people's reviews. It doesn't seem quite as effective for me. If I take two pills I don't end up going at all (without them I usually move at least once). If I take 3, things are too loose and I get bloated. I made sure to dring a lot of water as other reviewers suggested. I also supplemented with hcl pills thinking that maybe was an issue. Neither seemed to make a difference. However, I did notice my body liked these better than herbal pills. I was hoping this would make me more consistently regular but I think I'll have to reserve it only for times when I'm constipated. You may be one of the people it works really well for though."
4,it works,"this product does what it says. unfortunately, if you stop taking it(for me anyway) i go back to being unregular. but i do maintenance every now and again. arrived on time"
1,"It was reviewed as one of the best, but worse than ever","I am very skeptical about all the hype about our colons and the toxins that are lurking. I decided to try a cleanser and this one claimed to be one of the best. The dose suggested is if I remember correctly, 4 pills at bedtime and if you did not get results, then you were to increase your dose to 6 pills. After the first night I got sick. Lets just say that I could not stop going to the bathroom. If I wanted to do that, then I would just eat a huge plate of mexican food. After this experience I doubt I will try another one."
4,works great but gives pretty bad cramps.,"I gave it to my husband for 6 days and from the first day, it worked good for him. He saw black stool his frist day (next morning). He said he was pretty shocked on how much stool was coming out of him when he thought he was a pretty regular guy. He was definitely going a lot more than usual.He even felt his pants a little looser around the waist and his eating habits were the same."
1,Oxy Powder,"Oxy-Powder Colon CleanseThis product is nothing more than a souped up laxative. Do not waste your money. It does not de-toxify or regulate. The product claims to produce three to five bowel movements the next day. It took three days to have any effect and then only produced one movement, and resulted in sever diarrhea later. I was left feeling the same afterward as I did before taking the product. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,It works just fine...,"I've used several bottles of this and I think it works just fine. Usually, I go through a bottle between Thanksgiving and New Year's to keep all that holiday goodness moving on down the line, so to speak. I've only gone through the recommended ""cleanse"" once or twice but and it seems to work pretty good there as well. My only complaint would be the large number of pills you have to take for an effective dose (I'm up to 6-8!) and it never has worked on deflating the pooch around my gut. I can feel clean inside, but there still is a sensation of bloatedness at the same time. Weird. In any event, I will definitely use it again and would recommend it to others. As far as the comments on it just giving you the runs...READ THE LABEL! It says right on there that your stool will be loose and explains why."
5,DEFINITELY WORKS - I used it 3x's LOVE IT,"This product definitely works. Expect loosed and watery stool, but the results are great. My husband and me both love it. We have used is three times and we love the results. This product is well worth the money and gets results. If you want the REAL CLEANSE, go with this. IT WORKS.I used Earth's Bounty Oxy Colon Cleanse and it is a WASTE OF MONEY. It's cheap and you get what you pay for in that is doesn't work well."
3,YIKES!,"I have dealt with constipation quite a bit so I decided to try a colon cleanser. Sometimes only having a bm once a week! I don't like how laxatives work. So, I bought oxypowder. The first night at 4 pills did nothing the next day, so the second night I increased to 5 pills. I definately was able to go the next day, so the next evening I took the same 5 pills at bedtime. By 4AM I was running to the toilet. Every two hours, uncontrollable urges to go and ended up missing work because of it. I could barely hold it in! AWFUL! doesn't seem right to me for it to be pouring out of me. Think I will go down two pills tonight but if I keep on having this turn out, I will stop. Cant afford to miss work."
2,Just so so.,"I have to say I was a little dissapointed with this book. Some of it was interesting but, all in all, her story was kind of dull. There were really no combat stories to talk about so she just whines about how female soldiers are objectified by the male soldiers, how bad the lack of hygiene & privacy is, yada, yada, yada. I thank her for serving our country but not for writing this book. It's nothing to write home about."
1,As a female Army medic...,"I found this book hard to read because of my dislike for the author. At the start of the story, we learn that she quits her civilian job because of problems with a female supervisor, which is a running theme throughout the whole book. Every female higher up (hell every female in the book) she dislikes because they are insanely incompetent. As a soldier, I understand crappy leadership, but women in our Army don't become SSG or higher by acting retarded and unmotivated. I feel like a good female soldier would highlight their female leaders skills and motivation, instead of making outrageous statements about them. This author seriously doesn't know how to look up to and respect other females without being jealous and hateful."
4,Be a journalist!,"I have Read `Ik hou meer van mijn geweer dan van jou' in Just one night. As a Dutch journalist - especially on military matters - I just want to say: Kayla Williams, if you want to be journalists - as you have written in your book - just do it...!! Most of the time we hear in Europe that the U.S.-army has so many women, and everything is getting well. Williams shows us the other side of the medal. I think there will be a long en winding road before women are fully accepted in every army in the world."
1,A waste of time for me and a shame for the Army,"As a German Police Officer, I was excited to hear about the Army Life in war of a woman`s point of view. - And I only got a big dissapointment.The experiences she`s telling about is not really a big, new impression to me, the usual circumstances for all uniformed members serving in an unimormed unit. An interesting book for civilists perhaps.But the stylistic way: Her associal language type, her self-heroic adventures (is there anyone who expects a 3-star-hotel in a war and is complaining about sleeping in bag on the floor for weeks?),and especially her adventures of drugs and sex, should not be published in a representative`s book of the Army. What should the reader think about?A bad girl, of ill repute? Or a bad Army?I`m sure there are more possibilities to show the Army`s life.I`m wondering about how she`s got the permission of her supervisor in the Army to publish ""her story""."
1,PLEASE?!?!?!,"I have the luxury of having known the author while in the service, and witnessed first hand how empowered she could be. Very impressive! All the F-Bombs and subjective morality in the world doesn't make her any more of a soldier than anyone else.I remember how shortly after she was drafted...no...wait?!?If I need my memoirs written in such a way as to make me appear like John Wayne, I might call the author. If I'm looking for someone to get my back in the foxhole I'll call a soldier."
4,Love My Rifle More Than You,What a way to look into a woman's views of military life.. So many woman can understand what & how she felt.
2,Loved The Title,"Not really much more than a light gloss on her time in the service. It has an ""as told to"" feel (which I know it was, but some of that type disguise it better). I was left thinking, ""Is that it?"" meaning, was this really worthy of being a book other than the fact that it's a ""soldier's story"" and ""a woman soldier's story"".Read it in one sitting. So there's that. Otherwise, if you're interested in a history of female combat experiences in Iraq, I'd wait for the other books I know are coming out of this period of our history."
1,Don't buy this book....it's full of nauseating pathetic drivel.,"This book is TERRIBLE. Do not buy it. She is a self-important whiny, complaining girl who is wrapped up in her own flaming s***. My wife was an Arabic translator for the Marine Corps, she read this book....with great difficulty. I had to endure swearing and words of annoyance and angry outbursts from her nearly every other page as she did, at the stupidity she found within its cover. She thought it wasn't worth the pages it was printed on.Perhaps civilians out there will read it and think its some wonderful stirring epic describing the female experience in combat and the military. It's not. Quite the opposite. Strong female narratives on war are few and far between, and I would certainly not include this book in those rare numbers.Don't waste your money, or your time...if you're unfortunate enough to receive it as a gift, use it as starter for your next campfire."
5,She Deserves A Medal!,"The very essence of what she writes about, is exactly what has needed to be said. I also am glad how she said it, uninhibited. She's a hero in my book for having the guts to bring to the light what the Army continually tries to keep covered up--that female soldiers are looked upon and used primarily for sex (whether anyone likes it or not). She further impressed me by admitting to using this to her advantage. What beautiful honesty!"
3,Not too deep,"I was hoping that this book would provide some insight on females in today's military. It does provide some perspective and a few eye-opening anecdotes, but nothing exceptionally deep. Additionally, the writing style is colloquial, which, although providing a more 'down to earth' feel, does get a little grating at times. A quick read and worth it for one person's account of the military."
3,Disappointing,"I read this book with great interest because both Williams and I were deployed witht he 101st and I thought it would be interesting to see the war from another 101st soldier's perspective. What I got was angry, wondering really, what war did Williams go to. I spent my year the only female in an all male unit and did not once get groped, leered at, or attacked. I went out everyday with the guys and was expected to pull my weight. The only part of William's book I found myself connecting with was the last chapter about coming home. That chapter was spot on. Otherwise William's story is not a accurate description of what it is like to be female in the military but should be subtitled The Story of One Young Female Soldier in the Army."
1,Love to Hear Myself Talk,"As a fellow Arabic linguist and female Iraq war vet, I was disappointed to see such a shallow portrayal of the struggles of women in combat. Ms. Williams, although making some pithy comments on Army leadership, does not show much integrity in her own behavior. When female soldiers flirt, take advantage of their gender, and participate in or refuse to object to the crude behavior of their comrades, they reinforce those habits. Having trained with Ms. Williams a few years back, I had hoped for a fresh perspective on the war, as well as some maturity gained by her experiences. It is far too easy to poke fun and criticize, but how about taking responsibility, speaking up, or becoming an honorable leader? This memoir shows a lot of raw emotion and promise, but it is not backed up by any moral or emotional depth."
1,Poor representation of women serving in Iraq,"As a woman Army Nurse Corps captain deployed in Iraq, with 17 years prior active duty enlisted service, I was dismayed to read Ms Williams account of her experiences, which seem more self-absorbed and immature than a representation of the brave, professional female soldiers and Marines that I have encountered here. I'm sure sexual advances and offenses occur here in Iraq, as they do all over the world in any organization, but I also know that if a woman in the military presents herself professionally and performs her job well, her male counterparts treat her with respect and not as cheaply as Ms Williams' book implies. When I read the book, I was hoping for a woman soldier's tale of being a true soldier and how her tour in Iraq helped facilitate that, as it has for many of us. I am proud to be a soldier and I actually do love my M16, much more than this book, which attempts to revive stereotypes I'd hoped we'd overcome."
3,Patchy but worth reading,This book really needs some good editing as at times we are left wanting more as ideas are left hanging. Still Williams does provide some excellent insights into what life was like in Iraq. It's very candid and she doesn't always come across as a likeable character. If you are interested in first hand accounts of women's service in the Army this book is definitely worth reading.
1,A Setback For Women In The Military...Like Me,"I have been in the Army for just over a decade. I have been deployed to Iraq and I'm sure I'll deploy at at least a couple more times before I retire. Personally, I found this book completely infuriating! Williams made money by fueling stereotypes that put woman back into the stone age. Contrary to what she would have you believe, not all male soldiers are trying to get into the pants of any willing female. Not that it never happens, but I would not consider it the norm. The majority of soldiers...men and women... are hardworking, self sacrificing individuals. The men I deployed with were very protective of the females, almost the the point of being annoying.This book went back and forth between Williams bragging about how eduacated and wonderful she thinks she is, and making a mockery of women in the Armed Forces.Please don't waste your time getting this book! If you do...please remember not to believe everything you read."
1,Love My Ego More Than You.,"Awful. As a female vet of Operation: Iraqi Freedom, I'm saddened to hear a voice like Williams' being heralded as the one to reify the collective military women's experience of Iraq. Snotty and snobbish, her prose is dull and stilted, and the experiences she describes are pretty ordinary, even outside a combat zone. If you believe you've a war story worth publishing, it seems like you should have a little ""trigger time"" to back it up. Williams' has none; all of her stories regard being a white blonde, having boobs, how dirty dust can make you, and throwing rocks at one another to pass time. She never lost a friend to gunfire, was never injured, and saw only one violent episode: a man who'd stumbled into a clearly marked minefield. This is a combat memoir? Hardly. These are the crude complaints of a person with a bone to pick with the Army and America for being ordinary while she thinks she's too special for either."
4,Great Read,"I read the reviews by a few active duty females and most were pretty bad. Some said the Sgt Williams made military women look bad. I am here to say that they are wrong. I am an active duty male and I can say that this is one of the most fair military stories that I have ever read. Good book, not what I expected."
2,Boring,"I skipped a lot of pages because I was bored. I found her lack of empathy for her fellow soldiers sad. I enjoyed Meichelbock's female perspective book much more. It was honest, endearing, and a whole lot more fun to read."
2,Female and foul-mouthed in the Army.,"I enjoyed this book more for my parallel experience of being a female soldier and linguist than for any real literary merit. Williams has a very jaded, negative view of the Army. For someone who was supposedly ""so educated"", her constant foul language was off-putting. Was she unable to find better words to express herself? What annoyed me most was the narcissistic tone of the whole book. The Army is about ""us"" and ""we"", the squad/platoon/company/etc, not ""I"" and ""me"", the individual.Having seen the comment that someone wished they could have read what she did during those 12-hour shifts, I must add that she had to submit the manuscript for classification review (for security purposes) before being allowed to send it to the publisher."
3,A unique point of view,"I got really interested in reading this book after hearing a couple interviews with the author on NPR. The perspective is unique and if you haven't read many first account soldier reports on the conditions in Iraq, this is worth reading. But it's uniqueness, that of being from a woman soldier, is not as compelling a story as it sounded in the interviews. Not sorry I took the time to read it, but didn't live up to my expectations in total."
3,It is an enigma depending on how you look at it.,"After reading all the reviews on this book (and I did read all of them), I had to read the book. After reading the book, I have concluded that I agree with almost all the reviewers - on both sides of the fence.I think this is a book worth reading, as long as you realize that it is only one woman's perspective (and, in some cases, only her opinion) and, that is not necessarily representative of the military or military personal in general. And, of course, providing you have an interest in the subject matter.I would advise getting the book from the library rather than spending money for it."
2,"""Is there something alive in here?""","An intriguing premise, decent special effects, and a competent musical score can't quite overcome this film's disjointed plot, amateur acting, slow pacing, and (at times) hilariously bad dialogue. A nice try, with some quirky originality, but ""The Suitcase"" for me was mostly lost luggage."
3,The SuitCase,Good micro budget film with interesting and unexpected plot twists.Visual FX where very inventive as well. Keep up the good work.
1,Garbage,"I purchased this item at CompUSA. What a mistake. It worked for a couple of weeks, then all of a sudden it stopped working. Support told me to reinstall it, but that did not work. Support was not very helpfull and had no other options to get the product working again. [...]"
4,A nice little blast from the past,"Ok, in the early 90s such English bands like Happy Mondays, Blur, Stone Roses, The Charlatans etc ruled the roost. There was a whole second tier of the so called ""Manchester"" sound (I take some liberty here by grouping bands on sound not city) encompassing groups like The Wendys, The Farm, The Dylans, Northside etc etc.A neatly produced little gem by Ian Broudie, Gobbledygook has some great tracks. It's easy to get lost in the blissed out drumming/guitar strumming of ""Pulling My Fingers Off"". ""Sun's Gonna Shine for Me Soon"" is a sweeping longer track. The jangle is especially interesting in songs like ""I Want You and I Want Your Friend"" and my favorite album track ""Half Pie"".If you like the Stone Roses and The Charlatans, beginning your exploration of second tier Manchester with The Wendys is a great choice, especially for 33 cents."
2,Doesn't stay on,"This cream just doesn't stay on, which renders it useless as a barrier cream as far as I can tell. It's too creamy and wipes right off. My daughter got a very nasty diaper rash and I couldn't figure out why her rash wasn't improving despite medication. Thankfully, I ran out of Mustela and had to buy something quick at the local store. Once I switched to Desitin, improvement began immediately, and you can understand why. Desitin is 40% zinc oxide and very thick. It doesn't all rub off on the diaper the second you put it back on, unlike this stuff. As a new mom, I didn't know the difference, but now I do. I'm hopeful that this will help other new moms too.I just don't recommend this product if a rash has already developed. Perhaps as a preventative measure, it works fine."
1,Please consider this BEFORE you buy it!,"AH-HEM! First of all, it's just under an hour long for all four seasons![major disappointment for me]. Secondly I live in Illinois where grape vines are yet to be seen by my eyes, and are certainly NOT a symbol for autumn. I thought they might show autumn being a ton of maple trees and deciduous forests-instead they show a bunch of grapes and an overly fat white bird perchimg over a ghoulish swamp. Winter was OK at best, spring was a bunch of flowers, and summer was the best one and it wasn't worth buying! I was trying, when I bought this, to get a blu ray that would capture all four seasons in one, instead, I get this cheaply done ""swampscape"". Unless I start living somewhere on the EAST COAST I don't think I'll ever watch it again [maybe for laughs]!!"
2,POOR Blu-ray image-quality with NO music variation on selected scenes,"I've seen many other nature and travel videos, e.g., Art Wolfe's Travel to the Edge and BBC's Earth series. in regular DVD format with much better HD image-quality than this Blu-ray format of The Four Seasons. Even PBS nature programs at HD-TV channel have much better image-quality. The videography of many post-card pretty landscapes was only as ordinary as many tourists' travel videos. As to the music, unless you 'Play All' the whole video from beginning to end, there's no variation of the musical score for each scene selected from the menu --- the same music accompaniment at the first scene is played repeatedly in a loop for every other season selection, which becomes boring after a while. Two stars only for the soothing instrumental music with no selection option."
3,Not His Best Work,"Sure This Was Ok, But Compared To The Quality That I've Come To Expect From Him, He Could Do Much Better"
1,Watch OUt!,"Watch out! Once you place this order, you can't go back and change it. Amazon is now allowing other vendors to sell their products on Amazon. While Amazon gets your money and sends it to the vender, it does not provide the ability to you to change or cancel an order; you have to contact the vendors directly yourself, which can be quite troublesome as each vendor has a different method and policy. If you think you are dealing with Amazon, think again!"
1,Be Careful! Not the original recordings!,"As is typical of Madacy productss, the songs on this CD for the most part are not the original recordings made in 1966. They are by ""the original artists"" (whatever that might mean), and they're not necessarily bad (for the most part), but they're different enough in some cases that you may be disappointed. Madacy compounds this problem, in my opinion, by not indicating very clearly that what they're up to. In any event, be forewarned."
5,"A straight, to the point book. Fabulous!",Very straight and to the point. I like this one better than the Conversations with God series! It is much more direct and to the point! A wonderful book and a MUST READ for all metaphysicians!
5,Life Changing,Love Without Conditions is by far the most important book I have read this life time. It is a totally life changing experience and assistsanyone who reads it in grasping the joy of a God of Unconditional Love.I have recommended this book to literarlly hundreds of people who haveall had the same experience. I read it over and over again.
2,Waaaaaaaaayyyyyy too preachy!,"Although there is good advice on forgiveness, the writing style is waaaaaaaaayyyyyy to preachy for me. It seems like almost every sentence contains the word, ""you."" You do this, you do that, you think this, you don't think that, you fear this, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you. Perhaps the book would have a different impact on me if I were a lapsed Catholic, but the message is greatly diminished by the style."
1,Did not work with my Laptop,"Bought the battery, the shipping and delivery was fast, but the battery did not work with my Toshiba Satellite M35X-S149 laptop - could not be charged and the laptop power utility could not recognize it. Don't know if it was particular battery defect or some general problem with vendor.(The battery type and shape matches the original one).I'm returning it.1/17/2008: update:Got another one - comp did recognize it and charges it.Alex."
4,52 Heavy Truck marques on 96 glossy pages,"This 1983 pictorial came to me as a very pleasant surprise, covering 52 major world wide truck brands and presenting them nicely in both color and black and white on glossy paper. This book is a huge improvement on the earlier Consumer Guide book entitled 'Big Trucks' published in 1979.Some of the best examples of these brands are depicted... examples include International's Transtar Eagle Brougham, and White's Road Commander II, Western Star's flashy cabover, and these pictures are a blend of both showroom and working examples.Text is concise yet does justice to each brand and describes models and their activities throughout the world.Well worth hunting down."
4,Ar23 Wheels,"Despite product description stating wheels do not come with center caps - they in fact DID. The came with the Smooth chrome steel center cap as in the product image.The wheels came as described well packaged, no issues with tire balance etc.**Beware on 2 of the wheels the center cap came dislodged in the package and damaged the finish on the wheel"
3,Generally nice recording,"The recording of Ave Maria is beautiful. For lack of a better analogy, I would have to say that this piece is like lasagna - it's so delicious it's hard to screw it up. The recordings of the impromptu's are less than wonderful. They seem to lack a certain polish and brilliance, which does not do them justice. However, this CD provides a nice intro to Schubert. The cut of Ave Maria is worth the price of admisson alone."
4,Some of Williams Best,"I love all three plays. William's characters are driven by enthrolling energy and emotion. Also, the power stuggles of the characters adds a lot to the play. He relies heavily on the stereotypes of Southern people, but does not overdo it. All the plays leave the reader with a bundle of emotions on their hand"
3,A near-total disaster.,"Although I'm a HUGE Angela Bofill fan, I must (sadly) say that this was her most lacklustre and uninspired album. Why? The heavily overproduced dance tracks ""Can't Slow Down"", ""Who Knows You Better"", ""Love Me For Today"" and ""This Is The Start"" are simply her all-time worst recordings--they were totally inappropriate for her and the results were truly disastrous. The only tracks which justify buying this album are the hauntingly gorgeous ballads ""No Love In Sight"", ""You're Always There"" and the title track (all of which compare favorably to the classic ballads which were the hallmark of her previous works)."
1,Elementary Principls of Economics,I am very very unhappy i have not received this book and i really wanted it. Your system sucks because i do not know who to speak to about this problem. Victor Padgett
2,OLD,"This item was in poor condition upon arrival, much worse than what it was listed. Also, not the seller's fault, but this manual is old, probably out-dated information for the Life & Health Insurance Exam. I had to order the current manual and state law book from KAPLAN... I wasted money and lots of time on this product, but it was admittedly all my fault."
4,"Very informative, yet, somewhat shallow",The film is a great introduction for the un-initiated in the current state of affairs in China. I visited China about 5 times now and the film did not show much that I did not know. I wish it went deeper in the fabric and the mentality of the Chinese society.I also recommendChina's Century of Humiliationfor a much more comprehensive look at the historical background that still shapes the ideology of the Chinese leaders today.
2,Perugina Milk Chocolate w/Cappucino Bar,"I used to love Perugina's Baci, so I decided to try this since I've never had their milk chocolate. Somehow I was just not impressed with this bar. It wasn't overly sweet, which is always good in my opinion, but there was something missing. Ritter Sport has a milk chocolate cappucino bar which is better, but is a little sweet for my taste. Before trying this one, you may want to try the one by Ritter Sport."
5,n essential for a decacent flourless chocolate cake,Hard to find...this particular chocolate is an essential in creating a marvelous flourless second-to-none chocolate cake.
3,"""I say old chap! How Jolly!""","I read this immediately after reading ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"" and found ""John Macnab"" the more enjoyable of the two. Buchan does a great job of describing the Scottish landscape but, in what I suppose is a case of art imitating life, I couldn't help seeing the characters as actors in an old b/w English movie! It made me want to read more about gillies and game-keepers so my next book was ""Lady Chatterly's Lover""! I say!"
1,Pretentious,"If your idea of a novel is something with a plot and conversations, this is not the book for you. This is 400-some pages of rambling, in which nothing really happens. The first 270 pages are filled with what the thoughts of Alice Pinkerton as she gets ready for church, the last 100 or so are her thoughts that evening as she readies for bed. On top of not actually being about anything, this book commits the sin of being pretentious. Ooh, I know who Trilby is, ooh, I know what Lewis Carroll wrote other than the Alice books, ooh, I've read a lot of obscure and not so obscure plays. If you enjoy the unfocused ramblings of the mad, or you like playing find the literary reference, buy the book. If you want a plot and character development, look elsewhere."
2,It's ok at first but trying to find a upd.ate to make it current is bad,"I found this device for about $325.00, and needed it for a trip up north,it started out fine at first but when I got into Maryland area it was real bad.Nothing would come up current and I got lost several times.I tried to find ways to up date my device but I can't seem to get anywere yet.If any one can help with this matter please e-mail me at nightworld1313@yahoo.com. Cobra mafg. sure puts a hold on any help,and trying to find updates, try for your selfs, you'll see what I'm going through."
2,Some nice features..but,"I bought this GPS for a trip from Maine to Florida. Although it took me on a good route through CT and gave me detailed info about upcoming turns, this thing took me through the middle of Washingon DC during morning rush hour. When I got to Florida, for some unknown reason this thing wouldn't tell me the next turn until I had passed the intersection. I'm better off with Mapquest."
1,Don't get this item,"I tried to use the COBRA and was disapointed. We tried to look for restaurants and the three places we tried were not in the system. When we tried to enter a restaurant we knew was at a certain location, the COBRA did not recognize the place we were looking for. Also, the unit told us to go to the ""highlighted street"" after entering a selected restaurant but did not direct us (as a gps should) to the street. One street we were directed to was not an actual street and had rocks across the road so we could not drive down the street and had to redirect ourselves another way."
2,Not everything it says it is...,"For the most part the GPS works just fine. It's late on telling you to turn sometimes. This Cobra has no idea if there is road construction, or any warning of them and no re-route instructions.I purchased this model for the traffic light warning system, which is terrible, it does not deliver what is promised. I went to the company's web site and down loaded an update, the only update they offer. It still worked so poorly, that I just wanted to take the whole thing back.If your going to buy a GPS for going places, do not buy this one. If you want to know where the speed and traffic cameras are? You better just pay attention, this model warns you at about 30% of those devices and often too late."
2,"Starts out ok, but doesn't last long","When I first tried out this GPS, I was quite happy with it. It was very simple to use, easy to learn and really just plug and go. It got us halfway to Big Bear from LA, but then got us lost because the freeways had closed. I found it to be accurate in some places, and truly not in others. It froze up quite a few times, and wouldn't turn on SEVERAL times, only to turn on a minute later. The time it takes to start up is fine, only about a minute and you're already ""navigating."" However, sometimes it just lags and, again, freezes up. Had I written a review the first day I got it, I would have given it at least 4 stars for the ease of use. Now that I've had it a week, I'm returning it, and am going back to using mapquest. It's just not worth 300 something dollars. Perhaps I'll try another GPS system when we're taking another trip, but for now, this one is definitely going back."
1,gps cobra dont work,gps cobra did not work high pitch sound and screen didn't come on they didnt check to be shere it worked before they shipped it..
5,DVD EZMaker USB2.0 is exactly what I was looking for,"I have a P4 2.4G system with 512meg memory with USB2.0 ports. This DVD EZMaker USB2.0 converted my old hi-8 tapes (graduation, wedding, cruises, birthday parties, ...) into good quality DVD's at a breeze with S-video connection. It transferrs the S-video inputs from my old Sony Hi-8 camcorder, Panasonc VCR, and Pioneer DVD player to VCD (for old VHS tapes) and DVD (for hi-8 tapes and DVD disc backups) very smoothly.The resulted video quality is really a pleasure to watch. I am very happy with it."
4,Thumps Up. took me 10 mins to make it up and running,"Pros: Compact/Simple/Easy to install. Device was detected on my first attempt and the resolution is also great. Works with Windows Movie Creator software.Cons: Software Interface. Provided software crashed when I had the USB plugged in. Have to unplug & launch the software again. So, be ready to do in-&-out."
4,Great value - easy to use,"This device was a breeze to install and works well in capturing video from my DVR as well as my camcorder. The only problem I have encountered is with the included MovieShop 6.5 software. I am running Windows XP and my system meets all the requirements. However, even with a clean install, the Movieshop program simply does not run on my computer. Luckily, I have another video editing and DVD burning program that easily integrates with the files I capture with this device. I suspect there is some conflict between the included MovieShop program and a pre-existing one on my computer. However, I have neither the time nor the patience to troubleshoot this problem.The video quality is good, although I find the sound to be a bit distorted."
4,A Good Product for Compatible Systems,"Why am I giving this little piece of hardware a four star when I actually had to send it back?For two reasons:One: GREAT tech support-via email- knowledgeable, prompt and helpfulTwo: Great video capture.Unfortunately my laptop did not support the sound input. This could be a problem as one user has noted, that there was lack of synchronicity.So, perhaps a new model with video and sound together!"
1,Video Audio Synchronization,"I worked for hours, followed all of Avermedia's reccomendations to optimize my cpu. I have a new 3ghz Dell and I could never get the audio to match the video. In the captured video the person would speak, 3 second later I hear them."
4,Good for Amatures,"I was't realy looking for any thing professional as idont have enogh time to spend on doing DVD movies.With the EZ maker i did great stuff and reccomend it to any business man who doesnt have enogh time to convirt DVD on a very professional level.It is very easy to use and very friendly.Regards,Omar Sukhon"
5,First Try At Video Capturing,"I got my Avermedia DVD EZMaker USB 2.0 and installed it and it worked like a charm. VERY easy to use. The software that came with it, however, is not that easy and I'll need some practice before I can use it. It has some features I would like to utilize, but that will come later. In the meantime, I'm using the device to capture my analog video to Windows Movie Maker and it's the easiest new hardware I've ever had. All I have to do is plug it in and it works!! No problems. I like the idea of not having to open my pc case."
4,works but some bugs,"UPDATE-- 12/18/05- Unit quit working already, cheaply made, wish I wouldn't have ordered this, can't get my money back now. But tech support is good, I am sending it back, just wish I could get my money instead of a replacement.I had trouble getting it to work. Hubby plugged and unplugged it fromthe back of the computer, then it finally worked and the computer recognized it. I had email customer support and they did reply each time in a timely manner. (I did downlod the newer driver from their site before installing the dvd EZmaker system.)It is so slow though- real time downloading the movie from vcr, so 2 hour movie takes 2 hours. Then the software doesn't edit very well (not enough options and hard to understand) so I used windows movie maker to edit but used the software that came with this to burn it to dvd. And this is a slow process also. All together it takes me about 4-5 hours for a 2 hour movie from vhs to dvd."
2,Poor DVD Quality!,"I have been extremely frustrated with this capture device. I received the DVD EZMaker USB2.0 for Christmas and have not successfully used it to copy an analog home video to DVD without the video quality degrading anytime the camera was moved. Seems to do OK for VCDs, but I bought it to do DVDs! Also, realize that it will not capture analog video in *.AVI format - only MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 formats or direct to DVD & VCD. I tried to use the MovieMaker software included to convert to *AVI, but it was extremely poor quality. I also tried to import the MPEG-2 files into Pinnacle Studio 8, but could not successfully edit them with that package either."
1,A Nightmare!,"Couldn't wait to get this after reading all the reviews, except of course the one. I thought...""gee, must not be too hard to work""...alas the one negative review here was my nightmare! It just wouldn't work. I uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted, thought I had it at one point.......then couldn't find the software anywhere. It never did locate the software! I think I'll try Pinnacle where there were no good reviews! That's what my friend has and it works well. First time reviews have let me down...except of course the one!"
1,Stay Away,"First, the quality of the image is horrible. It does support the S-Video, but the quality of output is even worse than the 8mm, not even close to Hi8. I don't think my computer limits the performance. I am using P4 2.8G,with 512 MB ram.Second, the software provided has very limited function. It doesn't even has the split and combine function. Record audio track is impossible. With only a few effects to add on.Finally, the price is ok. DON'T EXPECT MUCH."
3,"Life With Elizabeth, not what the package states.","The rear cover of the packaging indicates that this contains episodes of ""The Betty White Show"", Betty's 1977 sitcom. It actually contains three episodes of her 1950's sitcom, ""Life With Elizabeth""."
4,OSS and the French Maquis,"OSS and the French MaquisW. J. Morgan's work ""The OSS and I"" is presented basically in two parts. The first part of the book deals with some of the tests given in England to prospective spies, saboteurs and guerrilla leaders from some of the Allied countries in World War II. The rest of the book covers the author's guerrilla activities with the French Maguis. This book should be of special interest to Special Operation Forces personnel and readers interested in the assessment and selection of men for special activities, with emphasis on the reactions of men to danger, simulated and actual. Overall a very interesting and good read for such a dated book."
1,Ordered something and got something els,I ordered new front break shoes and got used rear break shoes. Waste of money if returned because it will cost more than the item price.
3,An ok Begginers book!,"I'm a 15 year old male and i wanted to get into witchcraft, so i bought this book. It's an ok book but most of the spells are meant to be cast by females. Most of the hate spells are directed toward men. And what is a GUFFAH BAG?????? Most of the items you have to use, you can't find anywhere or don't know where to get them. Overall, this book is an Intermediate book. You have to know a little bit about what you are doing. AND IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO CONTACT SARAH LYDDON MORRISON, PLEASE EMAIL ME. Thanks"
2,Don't Bother,"While some of the spells may work, the revealing of darker magic is not Wicca. If you are looking for true Wicca, try Scott Cunningham or Gerina Dunwich. There are many fine Wiccan books out, but this isn't one of them."
1,Someone please turn this woman into a frog!,While this was probably the best (and by that I just mean this one wasn't full of death spells the author had never tried before or references to God's wrath against homosexuals) I don't think it's a very good spellbook. Many of the bad reviews come from the more conservative Wiccans but I would say that even if you are a non-wiccan this book is useless. Even if you are ok with delving a litle into the dark side (not everyone believes in the rule of three) there are better books out there that deal with this. Embracing The Moon by Yasmine Galenorn was a great book that included sexually charged spells and spells to mete out justice. The only peple who might like this bok are those who already have a background with either Polynesian or West African magic (but if they do they are probably ahead of Morrison's work already).
2,"A solid sourcebook for some, but not I.","I own all three of Sarah's spellbooks, and I find them amusing and occasionally useful. Her 'voice' is delightful. But remember, Sarah is *not* Wiccan, nor has she ever claimed to be. Those that are Wiccan should take the time to consider before trying any of Sarah's spell. I did think that this book would be an excellent springboard into studies of Yoruban and Hawaiian magick, if your tastes run that way. Blessings."
1,NOT REAL WITCHCRAFT!,My God!! What is wrong with this woman?! She knows nothing about real Witchcraft. I think she needs to do a little more reading herself!
3,Australian SF Reader,"Exploratory spaceships from Earth are crewed by digitised personalities. 110 years after it left, one such ship encounters alien ships.These almost miraculously build a bunch of orbital towers in space. Some of the crew inhabit android bodies to go and investigate.It turns out that these amazing alien devices have been left so that only one man can use them, probably the most dysfunctional personality they have.One of the uses for this technology is FTL travel, so the ship can return to Earth. Their planet has been decimated by AI and not many humans are left.Most of those that are have taken on some posthuman traits themselves."
5,A gift or a curse?,"A engram crew of a survey ship runs into an alien race that likes to leave gifts. This gifts take many forms, mostly in the form of information or high-tech wonders. But the aliens don't stick around, but just dump the gifts and leave.Can they be trusted? Or are they just paranoid? Do they have REASON to be paranoid?The gifts, from a faster-than-light ship to a library full of information about the galaxy, all seem too perfect. Was the survey ship just at the right place at the right time, or is there something more happening?This is a hard science fiction adventure, a first contact novel and a dangerous mystery all in one. Can Peter Alander figure out what to do? Can he help humanity, made up of people who look at him as nothing more then a flawed program, or will he end up failing it?I enjoyed the novel very much and really found the idea that most of the characters are not even living beings, if defined by our standards, to be a nice touch."
3,The end of the world in more ways than one.,"This is the first book in the Orphans of Earth trilogy. These are Science Fiction rather than Science Fantasy novels. A lot of thought has gone into the science behind this story of a sudden gift of alien advanced technology and the destruction of earth and humanity as we know it.I have to say that I found this book slow going, especially in the early chapters. I wasn't expecting a novel that was so heavily science based. In the end I found this a well written story, with some very clever technological ideas, but at the same time a rather depressing book about a possible future for earth. We see our home destroyed in more ways than one and not just by aliens.If you are after a real SF novel with well thought out science to back up an apocalyptic story then this book is for you - but I'm not sure its really my favourite type of story"
5,Love and hate,I have been reading Science Fiction for 45 years and this is one of the best hard Science Fiction novels I have ever read. It is also one of the most depressing. I won't spoil it for you by telling you why except to say that you may look differently at your computer and at technological research after you finish the book.
5,Another great one from Dix and Williams,"Having thourouhly enjoyed the Evergence series, I was thrilled to see another book by Dix and Williams. This book (hopefully the first in a series) is NOT a clone of their previous series. There is a different kind of action here, yet no less gripping in my opinion. I was drawn in within the first chapter and the book continued to fill my head with questions and provoked some interesting thoughts on some age old concepts involving our species. This book had a kind of ""Michael Crichton"" feel to it, a group of scientists trying to unravel a mysterious something. I intentionally am not putting any story details in my review, as that will be for each person to discover on thier own. I will say that just like Evergence, I had trouble putting the book down each night and am anxiously awaiting the next book. Dix and Williams have a knack for creating lush environments in which their interesting characters can interact.Keep em comin guys! You rock!"
2,Not particularly good,"This book is full of half realized fantastical ideas that it doesn't back up at all.It pretty much loses its own thread and concentrates on some kind of existential crisis that the fake people in the bookshould have learned to live with before being sent on a long space mission.The technology is magical with no explanation at all.And the ending while impressive, is depressing and meaningless, leaving one with vast sense of dissatisfaction.This novel should have had an EDITOR who might have pushed the authors to work a little harder and back up their half formed concepts.Why would I want to read a trilogy, if they are all as tedious as this one ?"
4,As Concise as Russian history can be,"Pipes' history book is a well formatted and interesting look at this period of Russian history.A great tool for professors that are trying to find something that will hold the attention of students without sacrificing the needed information in the Russian Revolutionary period.This period of Russian history (as with most periods) is full of many confusing names, complex patterns and social happenings. Pipes' look at the period keeps things concise and lets the fascination inherent in this topic shine through for itself.An excellent read for people interested in Russian history that are looking for something concrete but digestable."
2,Not as great as it sounds.,"I read this book and I have to say, I'm unimpressed. The man's bias gets in the way of objective reporting of what happened. This guy has such a disgust of Bolshevism he lets in get in the way. Fortunately for me, I had read more accurate histories of the early USSR before I read this one, and thus was able to find out the truths this one is woefully lacking in. Don't read this book; Read Trotsky's history of the Russian Revolution, and I've found E.H.Carr's book to be good as well. This is too biased."
4,"Large Print ""Gift from the Sea""","I ordered this large print edition and another older one found on Amazon. This print was not as large as the other edition I ordered, but I was glad just to have found this book in large print."
2,Loved the first several pages,As the book progressed I found it tiresome. Same type of thing over and over--just didnt want to read it anymore.
4,Favorite Book,Very Comtemplative and written after the Lindbergh kidnapping about how Anne went to the sea and pondered the meaning of each shell to help her heal after losing her baby. I highly recommend this book.
2,Damaged Book Cover,"The 50th Anniversary Edition would have been a nice book with a beautiful cover design, except the paper book cover was very wrinkled. It made for a disappointing gift. It was not wrinkled in transit but due to poor quality control at Amazon."
3,A reissue,"Gift From The Sea was first published in 1955 and was the best-selling nonfiction book of the year with 80 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list. I'm discovering it for the first time. It's simply lovely and is deserving of this new 50th Anniversary edition of 130 pages.It is obvious that the sea and the beach were an integral part of Ann Morrow Lindbergh's life as her writings are full of references to them.Gift From The Sea is a woman's poetic reflection about the challenges we all face in our relationships with our family, friends, the world and ourselves. They are her thoughts and ideas but are universal when thinking about the human condition.The introduction is written by Anne Morrow Lindbergh's son Reeve. Even 50 years after it was written, it continues to be fresh and filled with wisdom. It's a book to be read, savored and read again."
5,Inspirational...Peaceful...Serene,"I am an author myself. Recently, a woman who had purchased two of my books mentioned to me that my style of writing reminded her of this little gem of a book titled Gift from the Sea by Anne Morrow Lindbergh. As soon as she shared this comment with me, I quickly jotted down the title and name of the author. I had every desire to get my hands on this book to discover if I could spot any similarities.My review today will not be as long as my typical book reviews. I can only say thank you to Anne Morrow Lindbergh for sharing her wonderful gift with the world. I would also like to say thank you to the woman who honored me by putting me in the same league as this gifted author. I am deeply moved to be compared even in the remotest way to such an inspirational, talented, deep-thinking author as Anne Morrow Lindbergh...it renders me almost speechless. What a fine compliment indeed!"
5,A must read for forward thinking women,Thank you Anne Morrow Lindbergh for this lovely book that reads like poetry. It is amazing how so many of the inward and societal struggles Lindbergh so eloquently writes about continue to be issues for women as they try to define their roles and be true to themselves.
5,Fantastic book! She is one super woman!,"Couldn't put this book down! Ready to re-read it again. So up-to-date. She has a way with words and expressing so beautifully, the thoughts of so many. Where is she today? What is she doing?"
4,reflections on marriage,"Enjoyed this book, even though it has been published for some time. Interesting insights into thestages of a marriage."
4,Gift From the Sea,"I was introduced to this book by my mother-in-law, who gave me her tattered copy from the 1960s. It was a wonderful gift to receive as a new mother, and the lessons in the book are timeless. I wanted to share this with some special friends who were not familiar with her book, and the 50th anniversary edition was beautiful. Thank you Anne Morrow Lindbergh for your words of wisdom that still ring true for all women who at times struggle to define themselves as they journey through life as wife, mother, and professional."
1,Gift from the Sea,"I ordered this as a new book, but the one I received had a handwritten note in ink from a mother to her daughter on the first page. In addition, the book was very small, not the size of the usual softcover books I previously ordered."
3,A Gift for Your Mom...,Listed as a 'summer read' in a local magazine list - I hadn't heard of this book. I picked it up and finished it from one afternoon into the next morning. And -- there was nothing surprising or new to be found here in the book - the pace at which its written and the uncomplicated natural way Lindbergh examines her life and her impressions of life's stages will have me passing this book on to many people in my life.
3,book for the beach,"I think mrs. Lindbergh thinks too much. She is educated to the max, andenjoys intellectual musings. She seems to be concerned about people not spending enough time alone, especially women. I think this book would have been better if given to my wife for a gift, that she could read at the beach while camping. I do not recommend it for men."
2,publication quality,I ordered 6 copies of this classic book to give as gifts. Two of the six were printed with pages upside down and/or not cut so the book was not readable.
2,Gifts from the sea,The photo of the book clearly shows the book and cardboard sleeve that the book belongs in. I received a book without the sleeve. This is not what I had purchased.
2,Hardly touching,This book came very highly recommended by two friends who are avid book readers. However I hate to admit that the book did not move me as much as my friends claimed that it moved them. I was more interested about the background references to the author's personal life and how the book came into being. That I would have read voraciously. The book is short but I don't intend to read it again to see what I missed. I believe a book either moves you or it doesn't. This particular book despite other rave reviews did not move me despite my great affinity for the sea and women writers. I wonder if perhaps if the book would have touched me differently if I read it in the beach rather than on a plane which I did.
2,Not for the practical,"I found this book frustrating and annoying. It was, for my taste, filled with too much non-productive lamentation. Perhaps I could have read farther, but I could not relate to this woman's feelings when I am quite satisfied with my already simplified, purpose-driven life. (This is not a reference to the popular book by a similar title.)"
5,Wonderful Book,This is a wonderful book that is as current today as when it was written. Anne Morrow Lindbergh is a role model for today's woman and it seems amazing that this was written fifty years ago. This book is a delight to read and would make a wonderful gift.
4,A meditation,"As beautiful and peaceful as any enlightened meditation, Gift from the Sea is a special joy in itself, and also serves as a delightful introduction to the wisdom and personality of Anne Morrow Lindbergh."
5,A must read for every woman,"I read this book about 40 years ago (and several times after that). I love how Mrs. Lindbergh spoke to any woman about life, love, children and loss. I seemed to have lost my copy during a move a few years ago and decided to replace it after all these years. It's as relevant today as it was 40 years ago and I can apply to my life today. She writes clearly and passionately. I'm buying copies for my daughters."
3,It's okay...,"I haven't finished the book yet, because it is pretty blah...its not even a long book! Its a relaxing read. Maybe it will get better as I go on."
4,Intellectual stimulation.,"I have to admit that I have a problem with finishing books, and so I did not completely finish reading this book. That aside, the majority of the book that I actually read was absolutely fantastic. It made me think about who I am on the outside in contrast to who I am on the inside. It was absolutely intellectually stimulating. I would recommend this book for all ages."
1,Disappointed.,Not what I thought it would be. I like a plot from real life or from a good creation. Not much on philosophy.
5,Truly a gift to anyone who reads it!,"This is my new favorite book of the summer... when I usually reads books like this, I like to highlight passages that are especially meaningful to me, however, in this case, the entire book would have been filled with highlighting. Every page seemed to speak to my soul in ways that were totally unexpected."
5,Gift from the Sea,"This book, like no other, has me constantly reading and re-reading it's pages. I, too, am in love with the ocean and am in search for solitude. To get away and reflect on the world around me and the world within me. Although I am unable to achieve this wonderful form of solitude in real life,I am able to when reading this book. Having been born the year after it was first published, it amazes me how relevant ""Gift from the Sea"" still is. The relationships, feelings, and insights all hit home."
2,The lives of Great Composters,I didnt care for this book much. Maybe it was just me. I have a love for art and music. But this just was not what i was looking for...
2,Shallow and boring,"I am a great Julian Simon / Björn Lomborg fan, but this book has a limited number of mostly useless diagrams, especially from non-US perspective. But any other Simon book."
4,"Good information, but sometimes frustrating","There is much excellent information here to gladden the heart of people who are gloomily convinced--as I once was--that the world is going to hell in a handbasket.This book is obviously intended as a reference guide. As such, sometimes the material seems a little shallow. And while very meticulously documented, on occasion the source citations are a little too vague for my tastes. For example, a chart on water pollution trends (on page 189) only cites the ""various years"" of the Council on Environmental Quality's Annual Report, and only shows numbers for 1972, 1982, and 1992, without showing us clearly whether an actual trend is visible.Despite these minor flaws, this is an excellent reference guide showing the often startlingly positive outlook for humanity on planet earth. It's a good reference that's worth having on your shelf."
2,Bad Miles,This is as if Miles hired the Prince band and left on tour WITHOUT telling then to change the tunes of their previous boss. This sounds more dated than anything Miles ever did (including his 40s and 50s stuff!). The sounds the keyboard player picks are laughable by now! the horrendous 'groove' bass lines are annoying and repetitive to the point of elevator and supermarket muzak quality. The only one that really 'plays' and still has a sound worth hearing is Miles. Don't waste your hard earned dollar on this plastic Madonna and Michael Jackson influenced stuff. Miles has a ton of other much more interesting albums (start backwards from 'the man with the horn').
5,I LOVE THIS CD......,"and I don't ""get"" Miles Davis. Since my music collection is 75% jazz, I feel I should love Miles Davis. I don't; I want to; I try; but I don't. That said, I love this CD. #1 reason: ""Human Nature"" with the solo by by Kenny Garrett. If you're depressed, play this cut; if you're in love, play this cut. To me, its sounds like the essence of life: love/hate, triumph/defeat. If you want to know if you're still alive, play this cut. #2 reason: While it seems to me the music is obviously well packaged by a consummate professional to appeal to the jazz masses, it's still emotional, unique music that anyone from borderline jazz enthusiast to certifiable Jazz Addict can enjoy. I guess it's that Miles genius that I dont' get that's the answer."
5,The Best General Physics Book Ever Written,"You'll learn more about quantum physics from this book than from any other, short of a college course with mathematical content. Read it. Give it to children. Amplify it's educational effect. Make the world a better place."
5,Want to know how light work?,"Dick Feynman is unbelievable. He pretty much rapped up QED - the contemporary theory of light in a book that isn't even thick enough to take the wobble out of my nightstand. Even if you're the lay off the street with even no elementary school education, you HAVE TO read this book. For ever afterwards you will literaly see light differently."
5,Another excellent book by Feynman,"To me Feynman is right up there with Albert Einstein. I love is fearlessness and is desire to see the truth. The Buddha and Feynman are probably enjoying a good laugh. I recommend his other book "" What do you care what other people think""."
3,Oh what might have been ...,"John Emms, co-winner of the 1997 British Championship plays the Nimzo-Indian himself and has attempted to write a 'road map' for us lesser fry. He only partly succeeded. The games are mostly modern - good enough. The diagrams are clear - OK. The notes are opinionated at times - no complaints here; I like a guy who can stand up for himself. Best of all he gives us a quiz at the back to see if we were paying attention - good stuff! But ... the quiz could have been longer; the recommended reply for Black vs. e3 is ... b6 only. There are many other valid tries but Emms glosses over them, and even admits that he had reservations about ... b6 while writing his book ,,,hmmmm.. And we are subjected to some tired replays of famous games including Botwinnik-Capablanca, AVRO '38 and Johner-Niemzowitsch, Dresden '26. Both fine games to be sure, but published many times before. All in all I think he dropped the ball ..."
3,buggy,"Great sounds, easy to use interface. However, it brought my perfectly tuned PC to its knees. From the beginning it was a challenge to install and register the product. If you read a warning that pretty much says you make one wrong move and you could be re-installing your OS - you know something's bad. After the installation, things seemed to work ok, untill I either ran a scan on my computer, or left the computer on for awhile. In about 30 min machine freezes.I removed gigastudio from my main PC, and I'm installing it on a dedicated machine - I thought I finally could do without MIDI cables, but not this time."
2,Very disappointing,I was very disappointed in this CD. The arrangements were skimpy - not asfull sounding as I had hoped.
1,AWFUL- GAVE ME A HEADACHE,"OMG What a hack job. You can get all of this and more, plus much better dialogue watching anything from Michael Tsarion"
3,Who Stole the Page Numbers?,"Why is it that page numbers are so often left off when a book is converted to electronic format? Page numbers help people to have conversations about books-you know the old dictum ""Are we on the same page?"". If one intends to use a book like this for academic purposes, it is impossible without page numbers.As far as the other formatting errors suggested below, none appear when reading via the Kindle software for Mac."
1,Psychology not philosophy,This is a book of psychology. For someone looking for a philosophy it is almost unreadable. I would say skip and go to other Russell's philosophical works.
4,good price for such a good package,"everything is great ,mark hanson' transcript very clear on each arrangement. only thing that caused evryone sad is many song in cd not present in the book."
5,Excellent overview of all issues related to stalking,"The mixed reviews so far are split between victims wanting something that reflects their experience and academics wanting the most up-to-date research findings. This book is not really to aid victims as much as it is to bolster the understanding of those who might be trying to serve their needs and assess their level of danger. It is academic in tone and that is off-putting to some. But these articles were designed for presentation at the regular stalking conference in Los Angeles so the tone fits the venue. I found it very informative and helpful in threat assessment, understanding different types of stalkers and what works to deter them. Victims can best use the information designed to help psychologically deter stalkers by robbing them of their pay-off--attention. It also explains that intermittent response is most likely to INCREASE stalking activity--as in slot machine payoffs."
1,"great book, BAD MOVIE",They took a great book and turned it into an unwatchable movie. any fan of John Fante (author of the book) should not see this.. IT WAS HORRIBLE. i wish there was someway to go back and take the name off of it. READ THE BOOK by Fante. dont watch the movie
5,Perfect for Tourists and Locals,"I really enjoy the Frommer's book series. It is great for both tourists visiting for a weekend, and also those who recently relocated to a new city. This book is immeasurably helpful and well structured."
1,Overpriced and low quality materials,"The trailer was intended to be used on a farm to transport a 150 gallon water tank to refill water tubs in the horse pastures. The product was easy enough to assemble despite the sketchy diagram provided in the box. The first problem quickly appeared after the first rain. You would expect an agricultural trailer to be properly coated for prolonged outdoor use, but rust spots appeared within a few days of the rainy weather. Within 3 months, one of the tires went flat despite very limited use. A local service station told me that the inner tube could not be repaired because the tire had significant dry rot - after only 3 months!! I checked the remaining tires; each had varying degrees of dry rot. Of course, all were labeled 'made in China.' The trailer cost almost $400 with shipping. It should have been made much better."
3,Utility Wagon,"Good points are the lack of a bed allows for custon design of the carrying surface useful for specialized equipment. I have one set up for a mobile trap and skeet range and buying a second for a 55 gallon water tank. With the frame at the wheel center line a lower center of garvity is achieved and care must be taken to ensure the fron wheel turning radis is not restricted.Bad points include the wheel axils are steel on steel, no bearings. The lack of a pull handle makes any long distance pulling by tractor rather than hand. The weight of the wagon frame and that of the attached equipment furtehr require machine towing. Not for highway use."
4,Good low budget movie/ with good laughs!!,"This movie is a low budget film, so if you are hung up on quailty in a film-- dont bother, But if you want some Good laughs and fun with your family and friends, then i recommend you get this movie. You have to have a sense of HUMOR for this film! I laugh so hard through this movie. Its about a Man who is gay and he turns his life around and decide he doesnt want to be gay anymore, but his mate is upset and all the ladies at Church start to like him and they start throwing there self at him, but the chick that he is intrested in doesnt buy it!! Then there is this lady in the film whos son is a drug dealer and he goes in the Chruch and shows out and start attacking people and I think he tryed to rob them! But Long story short, the man gets out of Jail and decide he wants revenge!! Like i said if you have a Sense of Humor- Buy it! If you dont like low budget films with ok actors- Dont buy it!!"
1,NOT WORTH THE STAR I GAVE IT,"DONT EVEN waste your time on this crap. acting horrible, cast no better, and who filmed this???"
5,chopin,Chopin is my favorite. I can listen to his music all day long. He revolutionized music. He is by far the greatest of all the composers. His fingers must have been made from rubber. His music will take you to places in your brain you did not know existed. BRAVO.
2,Arrived broken,"I ordered a medium reptile den for my leopard gecko as part of his new desert terrarium setup. The den arrived today broken in several pieces although the packaging was undamaged & it was well packed. It looks to be an interesting item but does appear to be rather fragile so I'm rethinking if this will work for me as I'm worried that my cats might knock the outer piece off & break it. My other concern is that the item has a really strong resin smell. I assume this would dissipate with washing & time, but I wouldn't want my gecko coming into contact with it until this odor had gone."
3,Breathing Fire,"I know I cannot ask much for what I paid for this movie and considering that I bought it for my brother. He told me that this movie do not have a good quality image/picture. It looked kind of dark, maybe is just because is an old movie, but because was an oldie he really wanted to see this movie and enjoyed it."
2,Sequel is lacking,Personally I found this sequel to be a far cry from the enthralling tale that was Knight Life. The narrative jumps around and it seems that David tries to hard to incorporate several other mythological literature heroes into the tale.The result is a storyline that doesn't flow and has no clear objective. I found myself struggling just to finish the book.Definitely a disappointment from the witty tales we are used to from this author.
2,One Knight Only -NOT a good sequel.,"I enjoyed the first book,(Knight Life) and was eager to read this one. It was a definite disappointment. I kept looking for more story after it had stopped- I can't say finished,because ""finish"" implies an ending and a resolution and neither of these were included in the book I read. Did Mr. David just get tired and quit writing? Did the publisher leave out some of the book? I don't know, but I'm VERY glad I borrowed it from the library before buying it."
2,"King Arthur, President","In ""One Knight Only"" Arthur Penn (the King Arthur modernized) once again must go on a quest for the Holy Grail to save the live of his wife Gwen (King Arthur's queen reincarnated).Slightly less humorous and a few shades darker than the first installment in David's trilogy, Arthur faces the legendary Gilgamesh in an effort to capture the Holy Grail. David obviously has researched his legendary characters, but those less versed in world mythology may be left slightly in the dark.My major problem with this novel was the use of italics passages for what I felt unapparent reasons. It disrupts the story and changes the tense of the story. All in all, though, it's worth a read, and I will be purchasing the third book in the series."
4,Really liked it.,"I found this book and the entire series very entertaining.The whole concept is intriging.Touches on secret societies and religion.Action, drama, comedy all in one book."
5,An Enjoyable Yet Comprehensive Read Well Illustrated,"This book has been a trusted overview source for my own research. The work consists of some twenty-four well written chapters prepared by leading professional historians, notably including Richard Maxwell Brown and Anne M. Butler. One need not agree with all the political and cultural perspectives presented here to appreciate the breadth and quality of the scholarship.The one and only drawback is the use of bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter in lieu of a consolidated bibliography. That said, the chronologies, maps, tables and illustrations supplementing the text make this book a real bargain for anyone fascinated by the American West."
1,Nonsense,"Mr. Chapman is unreadable. I'm kind of wondering if he was high on bath salts when he penned this literary abortion. If you were in a bind, the pages would manage as a viable substitute for toilet paper."
3,"If You Liked ""Queenie""...","If you liked ""Queenie"", you would hope to like ""Curtain"", but you'll be disappointed. It's a less-entertaining companion piece. This time, the central characters are based (at first) on still more people from Uncle Alex's wartime L.A. and London: Olivier and Leigh; their stage colleagues; Danny Kaye; a Billy Rose type. The structure is too close to ""Queenie"", the plot is too contrived, and the stars are quite tiresome over too many pages. There's a lot about the Magic of the Theatre, but the only memorable laughs and tears are in the scenes with the two Bad Guys; you'll wish it were their book instead. As in his memoirs, Korda may be too calm and too nice to be a great writer, though the talent is there; he's a butter knife when you want a dagger."
3,Not what I was looking for.,This was not what I really wanted. But will use them anyway. I was looking for a heavier glove liner.
4,Not Stylish but Keeps Me Warm,These glove liners may not look like much but they certainly keep my hands warm. I put them under a pair of 180s and my hands stay warm for the 5-8 hours I am outside at work.
5,Love these!,I wore these in the Marines...they are awesome. I wear them under my regular gloves and when you need your fingers for minor things like buttons or zippers these keep your hands warm with your gloves off. Love em.
2,Nothing special,These did nothing special and they started to come apart almost immediately. I certainly hope that these are not supplied to our men in uniform. They deserve much better.
2,eh,I used this to hold a molding on a faux fireplace i was building and ended up just hammering the pieces on because the glue alone would not hold.
5,There isn't any better wood glue than Titebond,The only thing to say is Titebond is the best wood glue available. I have friends who build and repair guitars professionally and it is all they use. Titebond is the gold standard for fine woodworking. I have been using it for year. If it is used correctly any failure is usually in the wood fiber itself. If you have any trouble it is probably because you are using the wrong type of adhesive for the wrong application. Titebond should always be used on bare sanded wood and clamped under moderate to heavy pressure for 6-8 hours.
5,Beautiful Bollywood Love Story,"Bollywood fans enjoy films like this one because they feature beautiful people in beautiful costumes and singing beautiful songs set agasint spectacular scenery. Chori Chori has all that and more. Ajay Devgan is taken aback when his marriage proposal to Sonali Bendre is turned down. The house he was buidling for their life together is abandonded - until Rani Mukerjee needs a place to live and makes her way to it after a chance meeting with Ajay. Rani uses the cover story of an impending marriage, which delights Ajay's extended family ... and seems to renew Sonali's interest in him. Ajay and Rani begin to ""pretend to be in love"" which leads to real love, but will either of them admit it? There are hints of Hollywood films here, but this is so much more enjoyable and satisfying. A great love story and a wonderful intro to Bollywood movies."
3,More info please,"While every transaction with Amazon has been flawless, this great dvd of a celtic festival in Goderich, Ontario, Canada was nice, but left me wanting more information on the artists who appeared on the DVD. Perhaps the festival promoters could write an enclosure for future DVDs telling a little about the performers; where they originated, how long they have been performing, contact information for individual performers, etc. I wished each performing solo or group talked a bit so I could learn more. However, the performances were varied and interesting, the sound was good and all left me wanting to know more. I will research the festival and hopefully attend future ones to find out what the DVD left me hungry for. I originally thought these were from the Celtic Colours festival in Nova Scotia, but enjoyed it nonetheless."
5,Far Too Jones - the best new band out there!,"Far Too Jones is destined for greatness. They have a sound that's both unique and at the same time, familiar. These five guys are true musicians, and the CD ""Picture Postcard Walls"" is a work of art that no one should miss out on. We know from personal experience that these are great guys, who deserve all the success they will have."
4,excellent band!!!,"I see this young band from Raleigh, North Carolina hitting it big with their latest release. Songs flow from rock to the rhythmic love song. Look for this band to do big things!!"
2,Vivaldi RV565,We receiverd the disc in time and in good condition but it appeared we had ordered the wrong disc (did nit contain te desired music) and decided to leave it with that.
2,i bought a gun for $0.57 and it was better then this one,"definetly took them 50 cents to make this cheap pieace of crap. don't waste your money unless its for kids, then by all means purchase it"
3,Bought as a gift,"Bought as a gift for someone, he had wanted to use it for practicing. It leaves from pretty nasty welts."
5,Excellent CD,This is a great CD. This project spotlights the solid vocals of Assurance. It is a must have for any southern gospel music fan.
3,Stick with Marriner's ASMF recordings,"These performance aren't bad but Marriner's later recordings with his own orchestra (the ASMF) have better playing and sound as well as more energy. Marriner may seem lightweight compared to some other performances but I find it refreshing, and Marriner never gets bogged down as so many others do."
3,Wonderful book,"The book has beautiful pictures, beads, and illustrations, but it's title, I found it not easy. The instructions on how to complete the projects were not complete, and as a beginner, I found it frustrating to follow along with the instructions. There were no step by step pictures for you to follow along, just to name a few problems I had with the book. It is a beautiful book, but I didn't find it easy."
3,Beautiful Photo Examples,"Just like the previous reviewer, I too expected to learn some beading basics from this book. After reading some of the instructions on the first page I stopped and thought, ""What are they talking about?"" and read it again but still didn't understand the beading lingo. The next chapter is on making your own glass beads. I STILL wanted to know what all the different beads, wires, pliers, clasps, etc were used for. I had enough trouble knowing what a glass bead looked like in the store so didn't feel ready to invest in tools to make them."
4,Slightly disappointed,"This was sent as a gift so I did not see it. It arrived in a timely manner but I was offered free gift wrap with a personal note. When it arrived, it was not wrapped and there was no note. I was disappointed."
3,The unusual world of M.C Escher,"Many words come to mind when attempting to describe the work of Dutch artist M.C Escher: surreal, haunting, mysterious, dream-like.Escher is best known for his exploration of the boundaries between art and reality (""Drawing Hands"", ""Reptiles"", ""Print Gallery""), and for his distortion of everday objects and mathematical experimentation with geometric shapes, patterns and perspectives (too many of his paintings to number). His best and most characteristic works, including ""Depth"" (1955), ""Stars"" (1948), and (naturally), ""Other World"" (1946) are highly imaginative, creating a fantastic and indescribable dream-universe all their own, one which must ultimately be experienced in order to be fully appreciated."
2,not like original,"I wore Ma Griffe over 40 years ago (I'm old, LOL) and I loved it. I have not been able to find the original again. The problem might be that the original did not fit all women. Many of my friends tried it and said it did not smell the same on them as it did on me. I read somewhere that Carven changed its formula to make it better for more women. Loved it then, do not love it now. Changed to Chanel No. 5."
2,Could be better...,"Okay, a LOT better. Some of the recordings sound horrible (especially St. Louis Blues, yick!). Most of these songs can be found with better quality, especially on the Ken Burn's JAZZ series Louis Armstrong CD. If you're a newbie to jazz, this wouldn't be bad to pick up, mostly due to the price, but if you're looking for a great CD to compliment an already-sizeable collection, give this one a pass."
2,forgettable,"compare this album to roach's work with percussionist metcalfe on ""serpent's lair"" and you'll see the vital importance of persussion in tribal/trance. the tribal melodies on their own can't take it to the higher meditative level, and without the focus and energy provided by percussion the whole thing degenerates into nothing special. where the ""serpent's lair"" was brilliant and finds a permanent space in the CD changer, ""origins"" will get the obligatory 2 plays before it's retired to the CD stack."
1,Disappointed with delivery,"I sent this candy bar to my mother in FL via Amazon/Prime; and it arrived melted and all broken up. I think I'm more disappointed than she was. It may be a small gift, but it cost enough for a candy bar. I sent her one at Christmas, but I guess it was cooler then. Still, the company should know how to ship things in and to warmer weather. I need to know how to get a refund. More than likely, she threw it all out, knowing her."
1,"Could this be the same guy that made ""Let It Be""?","It is shocking to see how far Westerberg has slipped since making ""Tim."" Most of these songs are painful to listen to and that is not because he is writing about tragedies, but because he is tragic!"
3,"sadly, not much staying power","this is the first bargain bin album i've purchased in a while that actually exceeded my expectations. of course, that wasn't very difficult. the last couple replacements albums are nearly unlistenably boring, and knowing that westerberg's solo career wasn't all that highly praised, i didn't know what to expect. but 14 songs is easily better than any replacements record since pleased to meet me. there's an energy here those last few releases were missing, the energy of a man beginning all over again with his crazy 80s days behind him. the melodies are classic, the delivery is sharp, this is a well-above-average collection of rock 'n' roll songs. and much easier to enjoy in the context of westerberg's career, before and after."
3,A Letdown But Still Worthwhile,"When you are a Replacements fan, you have slightly higher expectations for the debut solo CD from the band's genius songwriter and lead singer. There are hints of greatness here and there...the bluster and snide contempt of ""World Class Fad"" is classic Westerberg, while ""Black Eyed Susan"" and ""First Glimmer"" are sad-eyed reflections that follow in All Shook Down's direction. I found myself humming along to ""Things"" and ""Mannequin Shop"", and ""Knockin On Mine"" rocks. That said, the rest of the album is really below par."
4,very respectable,"For the most part, Westerberg's solo debut is on par with most of his albums with the Replacements. Of course, there are a few duds (""Even Here We Are"", ""Things"", ""Glimmer of Light""), but for the most part, it's a fast paced album that just plain rocks."
2,Not so Good,"This album is disapointing! Without the chemistry of the rest of the replacements behind him the songs sound bland. There are a couple good songs but they all fall short of replacements quality material. The writing is weak for the majority of the songs too. If you want a good post-replacemets solo recond get Tommy Stinson's ""Village Gorillia Head"" or the Bash and Pop they're excelent."
5,uncertain certitude and 14 little songs,"""14 Songs"", an apt title for someone constantly stating the obvious in often revelatory ways, has been part of my life for over a decade. I remember the day I bought it...summer before freshman year in high school and miniture golf would never cut it again. All those hormones and songs such as ""First Glimmer"" and ""Runaway Wind"", quite a heady mix. I latched onto the cynicism of ""World Class Fad"", ""Dice Behind Your Shades"" and, really, the whole album. ""Things"" though, remains the melancholic lament that rings true over and over whenever i'm love sick. It's the parts more than the whole, whatever that means, that make this the bluest and truest album I own."
5,"Lad , a dog",One of my all time favorite authors! This is Terhune at his finest! If you love dogs you'll love this fast moving exciting novel!
4,For dog lovers and children,I really enjoyed this book. I read to my children and they really liked it.Lisa Cohoe
4,One of the great dog books ...,"As long as you can ignore the bigotry of the author (he was a rich, white aristocrat of the pre WWI variety, so he was a snob and a bigot), his writing about the nobility of dogs, his ability to make them live in your mind is still unsurpassed. The author wouldn't pass a modern ""political correctness"" test, but if you love dogs and you are mature enough to understand that authors are people and thus flawed, this is a book you should NOT miss."
1,Great story. Terrible edition.,"I love this story. I read it as a child and wanted to share it with my 11 year old daughter. I bought the General Books LLC (October 14, 2010) edition only to find that there are so many typos and errors in the text that it is practically unreadable. This copy was robotically scanned in (99% accuracy, unless a page is missing or two pages are stuck together during the process) and printed using Optical Character Recognition software (again, only 99% accurate, worse if the book used to scan was old or worn). No human ever proofread this book and there are so many errors, it became difficult to even read the text at all and took away much of the fluidity and grace of the story. So by all means, buy this book, it is a classic, timeless story. But please buy a different edition. One proofed by human eyes. This one is an embarrassment to publishing houses everywhere."
2,Typical throwaway,"2 1/2Yet another in the never-ending onslaught of modern progressive rock letdowns providing typically watered up, easy listening rock, whereas (also typically) few instrumental segments provide the only obvious musical substance behind the awkwardly obscure fan concert."
5,this pay per view was great but the kimbo slice vs tank abbott was the worst fight on the card,elitexc is my favorite MMA Promotion and this pay per view was great it showed the return of Tank Abbott as he fought kimbo slice. Kimbo slice is my favorite Fighter but he did not do much in this fight and i thought this was the worst fight on this card.
3,Variations on same box set,"FYI - The copy of Nightmare Worlds I have (copyright on box shows 2006) does not have The Return Of Dr. Mabuse (W Ger/France/Italy 1961) - Lex Barker but instead has The Severed Arm (1973) - Deborah Walley.So, if you are specifically buying this box set for The Return Of Dr. Mabuse, beware that you may get a version which does not have this specific movie.All other titles are the same as listed in the product description and other reviews."
1,Do NOT BUY if...,"Do not buy this item if you have any appreciation for video transfer. On many of the movies the sound and video quality is terrible.On several movies it looks like someone made the video transfer from videotaping the movies while watching them on television.Don't make the mistake I made. In hindsight, I would only purchase this collection if I found it in a dollar bin sale, which is most likely where these Mill Creek collections will be in a year or so."
3,an okay collection for the $$. too bad the quality whomps.,"I am a huge fan of cheesy horror/sci-fi movies and while these flicks are all public domain and can be watched for free online I decided to pick up this box-set for big-screen viewing. First off you get what you pay for. Don't expect to be truly terrified or mesmerized. But if you enjoy cheesy plots, bad special affects, and over-acting, and can stomach the sometimes deplorable film quality than you will enjoy this pack. Beware the nudity/sex in a few of them especially if you've got kiddies running around. I had to toss a few of the discs myself."
2,"""The War Game"" is NOT part of this set","Buyers Beware - The Amazon editorial review has the Oscar winning ""THE WAR GAME"" listed as one of the movies in this set. This is not the case - it is not one of the 50 movies on the discs."
2,1978 thriller film..,"A man in town for a convention gets lost while trying to return to his hotel room after seeing a woman and ends up being taken in by a mortician to wait out a storm. To pass the time, the mortician shows the man four recently deceased people and begins to tell him how each person ended up as an occupant of one of his coffins."

4,SO BAD THEY'RE GREAT,"what do some of these people expect for 50 movies for $14.95 ? i expected REALLY bad movies and thats exactly what i got .these are the kind of movies i remember watcing on tv late on a saturday nite when i was a kid. i just got this set, so far i've watched 2 of the movies. one of the great things is that when i looked up these two movies online , i found one of them on dvd for $7.98 and the other for $12.95. thats over $ 20 for just two of them if bought seperately and i got 50 for $ 14.95. how can anyone complain ? if you expect more than bad movies don't buy these sets but if you love bad movies its a great buy . i plan on buying a lot more of these sets"
1,Poor quality overrides cheesy fun factor,"All these are public domain movies with low production values. It's basically the same stuff that was shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000 but without the comments. I happen to like a cheesy movie now and again and am quite able to yell out my own quips with my friends. However, the DVD's are bad. By bad I mean that they blur out in digital green squares. Others in the set were watched once then not able to be watched again. The DVD player tried to index to the menu for a minute and ejected it. They remind me of the old Goodtimes videos of the 80's that had tracking lines no matter where you set the dial. These could be a fun bit of cheesy movie value but it's lost by the poor quality DVD's that wear out quickly and become unreadable."
1,Total waste of time and money too!,"Again, the picture and sound quality is a torture for the eye and ear! The colors are grey and green. It's a very very bad VHS tape picture, black on the edges! Very ugly!"
3,Missing title,"Despite it being listed on the outside of the box, the 1976 TVM ""THE DISAPPEARACE OF FLIGHT 412"" is not included in the set (at least it's not on any of the disc jackets). Instead the BBC drama WAR GAME is added. Was this a last minute change that didn't result in the box being reprinted???"
1,Bad movies - no entertainment value,"Let me start by saying I LOVE old bad movies. Plan 9? Gold! These movies...are horrible! Boring, poor quality, poor lighting, poor acting (not the good kind of poor acting, just plain bad!). Of the 50 movies I found at most 4 that were worth watching, and even some of those were bad at best. I have other of the ""50 movies"" and this is the worst of them. Save your money, really."
2,Poor selection and horrible production values,"First, read the list of titles carefully. This compilation, with a few exceptions, really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. Even for those of us who enjoy the occasional home matinee populated by aliens with zippers in their skin and earthly heroes wearing plastic fishbowls on their heads may find that many of these films are just too cheesy to be tolerable.Annoyingly, the compilers have done--so far as I can tell--absolutely no clean up on either the visuals or the sound. As a result, some of the films are scratched, dirty, and difficult to understand.All in all, a disappointing collection. Dirt cheap, though. Caveat emptor."
5,A must for everybody into Ancient Greek Religion.,Totally agree with Silja Harel's review. An excellent book by an expert on the subject.The Greek translation is also very good.
5,A great read!,"What a great read! I discovered McAleer's book after a buddy's recommendation. I love well-written series infused with humor and wit. Double Endorsement is not only a delight to read, but zooms along at a Nascar pace. From the clever PI to his able colleague to the blonde babe who lights up the pages, the characters lend sizzle and flash. A yummy treat, I'm looking forward to the author's next outing."
5,"Splendid, Fun, Read!","NEW YORK TIMES bestseller of THE FRENCH CONNECTION, Robin Moore, calls Andrew McAleer's DOUBLE ENDORSEMENT ""An intricate and original private eye mystery. Andrew McAleer's DOUBLE ENDORSEMENT grips the reader's attention from start to finish and is one of the most humorous novels I've read in a long, long time. A wit and pace reminiscent of P.G. Wodehouse."" And I think Moore is right on target. Rex Stout fans will particularly take delight in this mystery novel. Enjoy!"
4,Just Plain Buggy!,"My sons enjoyed this book tremendously. I heard the word ""cool"" come out of thier mouths more than once. The pictures were very detailed. It was easy for my first grader to read."
5,Practical Spiritualiy,"This book is a gift to those individuals seeking balance, meaning and authenticity in their personal and business lives.The reader will learn how to access his or her own creative energy and inner-wisdom.As students and practitioners of Dr. Jue's Quantum Decision Making paradigm we have experienced first hand profound and transformational life enhancing change both in our inter-personal and business relationships.Conrad and Patricia Wilkinson,Attorneys and business ownersWilkinson & Wilkinson, A.P.C."
5,Time Well Spent,"This is the most important book available today for executives who are wrestling with the balance of spiritual practice and bottom-line values in Corporate America. This book serves as an excellent guidebook for those who are sensitive to the value of time-honored spiritual practices as core to the success of their organization but who also want practical steps to re-introduce those values within the corporate setting. It describes perfectly the need for a re-awakening of spiritual growth and provides a blueprint for insight within the organization and within the person. As the co-founder of Madre Coffee & Tea, I grew personally from the guidance offered and have implemented many of the techniques within our organization."
4,"Add to your ""how to"" reading library for business & life","We are living in a time when ethics are suspect at best and ""successful"" individuals are looking for more ""fulfillment"". Ron Jue and Dick Wedemeyer have written a remarkable book that can put the reader on a more enlightened and authentic path, not only in business, but in life as well."
2,basic information,"This book does not contain as much detail as I would have expected from such a highly rated text. While it is informative, as a resource it is not terribly useful. There is little detail packed into the scant 163 pages offered here. Overpriced."
2,Coverking Seat Covers - Volvo S80,"This review has two ratings. First, Coverking products do fit well and feel wonderful. Readjusted them once already, may have to continue that. They don't seem to stay put very well. Maybe a piece of that non-slip stuff used under rugs will work. Now the second part, less complimentary. Their web site does say that ""...include everything that is needed --....console covers..."". That is where this company is advertising falsely and incorrectly. I ordered these because my leather front console is peeling. It was not included in the order and, as dealt with by the wonderful people at Autobarn (***** 5 star rating for their efforts), I have been informed that the console covers are ONLY for consoles that fold up into a seat. This is not so stated on the Coverking website. I may return these as I am dissatisfied at the remaining ""bad"" leather in my car, although the seat looks much better now. Maybe I should have used an actual store."
1,Features Sound Good but...,"I bought this camera to test it as a security camera for a store I own. The camera sounds good if you look at all the features it has but when I hooked it up I found the software to be pretty bad. I'm a software engineer so maybe I expect too much but when you open the software and it takes up the full screen without a minimize button, i consider that pretty bad. Not to mention the software is not very intuitive at all and pretty difficult to work with.I also found that the picture quality was pretty poor as well. I have not worked with too many cameras but I have seen low price webcams with better pictures quality than this. And when you factor in the price, then it really is not worth it."
1,Buggy wireless,"Even after an upgrade to the newest firmware, the wireless connection was buggy. The included ""IP configuration"" tool never found the camera even after it had obtained an IP address from my router. I had to use the DHCP table from my router to find the camera's IP address. I eventually got it connected to my wireless network (40b WEP, DHCP), but after about 10min it killed all of my wireless connections. Worked ok when connected to wired ethernet network (except that the config util couldn't find the camera). Returning it ASAP."
2,Make sure you have lots of light,"Bought this for use as a baby monitor; as it turns out, when we close the curtains and turn off the lights for her daytime nap, it gets so dark that the camera is useless. We didn't think it wsa that dark, but color cameras need a decent amount of light to work with, and much more than you'd think. Obviously that would keep her awake, hence defeating the concept of baby monitor while she's sleeping.I returned it and am now looking for a decent B&W one."
3,Boot Review,"I like the style but I was surprised at the weight of the boot, I really didn't expect it to be as heavy as it is. Also, they looked prettier in the picture..."
4,i like it,"i was alil scared because it look soo big, but when i tried it out it was still big but it was pretty good , but i wish would have got it alil smaller."
5,doc johnson dildo,this was a good deal. doc johnson is a good brand. priced right and according to my wife it does the job. lifelike and durable. good service.
5,Easily Interpreting the Tarot Deck with Superior Home Video,"This is a great video! This tape shows you how to easily understand and interpret the true meanings of each card within the Tarot deck. Presented in colorful, artistic and attractive settings with soft, soothing music to create the most desired moods. The interpreter will guide you through the divinative meanings, allowing each individual to discover their own ability to read and understand the cards. The true essence of the Tarot comes from within the reader, as well as the individual asking the reader to interpret the information found in the cards."
5,Great for wider width little feet.,"I bought a pair of these for my ""bam-bam"" who unfortunately has ""Barney Rubble feet"" like his Grandpa which are very wide accompanied by a high arch (the best of both worlds, right?) I've worn Hi-Tecs before in fire/rescue work and was familiar w/ the brand, but had never purchased any of their kids stuff, especially sandals. I should have known better because these are absolutely PERFECT for the hard to fit tall/wide footed kids who would rather go barefoot because most shoes are too uncomfortable for them. The velcro closures give incredible flexibility w/ or w/o socks and the soles are durable and non-slip. As far as ""comfortability"" goes, he wouldn't take them off, if that tells you anything."
1,Terrible to be used as a textbook,"While the book is informative and the opposite of a John Douglas book, it is terrible to be used as a textbook in a classroom. The book has numerous grammatical and spelling errors, and if that isn't enough to irritate a student that has received bad grades on papers for the same issue, it is fully opinionated. Not sure why someone writing a textbook would fill it with opinions instead of facts, but Keppel did it! On top of that, it is the same information repeated several different ways over the course of chapters in it. If you are a professor/instructor, please continue looking for a better book - your students would appreciate it. If you are a student, bring these complaints to light to your professors/instructors and ask them to use a different book - your classmates will appreciate you!"
1,KINDLE EDITION: UNNECESSARY RIPOFF!,"The hardcover book sells for approximately $45. The Kindle edition for approximately $39. Yet the digital book avoids all the publication and distribution and inventory costs. One can only conclude that the publisher is making an unreasonable profit and is not willing to offer the public digital books in the spirit of reducing costs for the consumer and making more books available to persons who otherwise would not be able to afford them. Shame on them.The above comments do NOT pertain to the book's content, i.e. the information contained in this book."
5,For the love of baseball,A fellow baseball fan recommended this book to my husband to read. It is not a new book but a great story and the first book I hsve seen my husband really get into and finish.
5,"Very nice compilation, Low volume on a few CDs",The set gives a very good idea on the work of these famous composers. Great value!The recording vol is low on a few CDs like the Wagner one.
4,How Can You Go Wrong?,"I downloaded this album in mp3 format yesterday. While I obviously haven't had a chance to listen to everything, the tracks I have listened to so far are wonderful. 106 tracks for 2 dollars? How could I have passed up an awesome value like that? It's great."
5,Great music for a great price!,"We got this set for our infant daughter. We play the CDs in the evening when we are getting her ready for bed. The music is soothing and the CD quality is great. I bought a used set of CDs, but would never know since all the CDs looked brand new and couple hadn't been opened yet. Very happy with the purchase!"
4,Decent collection to get started with,"No big names here, but a quick collection. I like the Strauss CD a lot."
1,Great Music... but I would like the other 70% of it....,"So I downloaded this today and the 29 songs that I received sound great! I'm sure the other 75 that didn't download correctly after trying twice sound great too. I mean, I know that I only spent $2.00, but I was really looking forward to this. Does any one know what I may be able to do to get these downloaded files into my I-Tunes? As of right now, they are in my downloaded music file listed at 75 variations of AMZ###.tmp and I cannot open them. (Ex: Clicking on AMZ73C8.tmp takes me to Windows can't open file without know what file to open it with... um... I-Tunes, like the other 29 that worked?) I am a bit of a computer idiot, so I apologize if this is a dumb question,... but can anyone help me? Thanks"
4,Composer list for tracks,"Mozart - tracks 1 to 11 (Nachtmusik to Cassation K99),Bach - tracks 12 to 25 (Suite No. 4 to Violin Concerto No. 2),Beethoven - tracks 26 to 35 (Symphony No. 5 to Egmont Overture),Strauss - tracks 36 to 43 (Die Fledermaus to Gypsy Baron einzugmarsch),Wagner - tracks 44 to 51 (Tannhauser overture to Tannhauser guests),Tchaikovsky - tracks 52 to 61 (Piano Concerto No. 1 to Eugene Onegin),Vivaldi - tracks 62 to 70 (Spring to Winter),Chopin - tracks 71 to 85 (Scherzo No. 1 to Mazurka No. 4),Schubert - tracks 86 to 95 (Ave Maria to Unfinished Symphony),Verdi - tracks 96 to 106 (Nabucco overture to La forza Overture)"
5,A Nutcracker for a lifetime.,"This is a recording that claims for a reissue. Incredibly judged, this is aNutcracker that really transports the listener to the original tale's world.Based on a german tale, this is really played in a german-dance style. TheStaatskapelle Dresden sounds magnificent and conductor Hans Vonk shows thebest of his art through this recording. Unforgettable and the one to get."
2,won't stay put,"we're starting to have a pretty big collection of geotrax items and I love most all of their construction quality but this one let us down, geotrax usually connect pieces together by a clipping system very solid and sturdy, small kids have difficulties putting them together or taking them apart, I do like that so there is no need to go help put it back together every other minute.but on this one, no idea why, they choose to change the system for a ""kinda fit in"" slide in, it keep detaching itself from the main circuit every time a car or train try to go through, it is very frustrating for my 3y old and for me...beside that yes, sure, door open, track turn to put the truck into parking space etc, but overall frustrating, especially as I don't get it... why did they had to mess it up?!"
3,Fun B movie,"They overdid the intro. The story wants to be complex but in reality its a simple story.It's a hack and combination of Star Wars, Macross, and other sci-fi movies.A lot of action here. Space battles with decent SPX. Definitely worth a watch. But keep in mind - it accomplishes its mission to be a good B movie.Just don't expect a Star Wars."
3,Humanity's End (2009),"When a distant race called the Nephilim makes it their task to erase humanity from the face of the galaxy, it's up to one man and one woman on a remote planet to avoid death and give humankind a fresh start. The task isn't easy with the ultraviolent Nephilim and another hybrid race known as the Konstrukts bent on destroying them.Overall, I enjoyed this film. The emotional tone was a little too ""campy"" for me personally, which took away from the (potential) drama of the film. The special effects were well done, and the cinematography was well-done as well. Editing was sharp. The actors did a fine job. The story was interesting as well. As another reviewer has noted, the film does deal with the primal themes of survival, and lost love amid the action scenes.sci-fi fans should enjoy this.."
1,Don't even rent or buy it!,"This movie is a terrible production! The audio in the introduction of the movie is awful!The video is terrible, I felt I was watching a PC computer game. The acting is bad. The special effects are terrible bad!You watch this movie, you will feel you went back in time ten years when the technology in movie making was catching up.DON'T RENT IT OR BUY IT!I will give it -2 **"
5,A GREAT BLEND,ORNETTE COLEMAN IS A GENIUS.THIS ALBUM IS FANTASTIC FROM START TO FINISH.ORNETTE&GROUP SOUND INCREDIBLE HERE.THE MUSIC here has alot of Color&Texture.
5,Remastered Change,"This is a classic recording, only slightly less compelling than Coleman's SHAPE OF JAZZ TO COME. If you like SHAPE, you'll certainly like CHANGE. These of course were recorded within a few months of each other, by the same legendary group (Coleman, Cherry, Haden, Higgins). To these ears, this remastered version is a big improvement (higher resolution) over the original CD. Same goes for the remastered version of SHAPE. These are both from the ATLANTIC MASTERS series (Warner Jazz), made in Germany. I haven't heard the much more expensive Japanese imports, but I expect the German ones may be hard to beat. The only downside is that you almost need a microscope to read the liner notes, and there's quite a bit to read."
5,classic,"I origionally bought this record along with ""Shape of Jazz to Come"" in 1981. It would be stating the obvious to say these are classics. Surely, everyone who has experienced the joy, humor, and meloncholy inherent in this music, has come to the same conclusion. I continue to be struck by the telepathic-like interplay between members of the group. I feel like I owe each of them a debt of graditude for expanding my musical universe. This music is beautiful and a gracious gift from four masters of thier craft. You really should buy it."
3,not as comfortable as others,"I have used the boppy and my brest friend pillows, saw the viva and thought it would be great. I found it not as comfortable as my brest friend and harder to use because of the straps. The back pillow was not easy to get the right amount of air to be comfortable. It's an okay product but I prefer the my brest friend pillow."
3,Boat railer,"Had to putit together, which was alot of work!!! I like the trailer but have reservations about recommending to others because having to put it together!!!"
2,Forgot to describe the action,"I have read,and bought all of the series. I was disappointed, when comparing with the others in the series. Much time is spent in describing minute details, but when it comes to action, such as the battle at the taking of the shore installation, it is all condensed into a few paragraphs. It is as if including the battle was an afterthought. Because it is a continuation of the series, it is worth reading, but is disappointing."
2,Asleep at the Watch,"Immerse yourself once again in the seafaring adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin as they roam the almost unexplored oceans of the early 17th century, and participate in the bittersweet ""liberation"" of Chile. The 85 year-old O'Brian's flawless dialogue and meticulous attention to detail makes this book -- like the rest of the series -- a historical tour de force. Unfortunately after 20 previous books, Aubrey and Maturin have few surprises left, and hundreds of pages filled with the impenetrable politics and minutia of daily naval life may be as stupefying as Dr. Maturin's regular doses of laudanum and hellebore for readers unaware that a great naval battle invariably lurks in the closing pages. O'Brian addicts will welcome another chance to visit their favorite characters, but people new to O'Brian should visit the earlier, fresher books of the series -- say ""The Far Side Of The World.""-- Auralgo"
3,Not one of O'Brian's best,"While certainly not a bad book, Blue at the mizzen is not one of the most interesting in the Aubrey/Maturin series. There is not a lot of action or tension in our hero's adventures in South America. Jack Aubrey is increasingly distant, and we get the majority of the story from Maturin. Even so, Maturin's espionage activities are somewhat less than gripping. I've heard rumors that this is the last book in the series, but there are a ton of things left unresolved, and I find It hard to believe that O'Brian would end the series this way."
2,Blue at Half-Staff,"A disappointing series of vignettes with major gaps in the story line. As a retired naval officer I'm aware that there is very little reportable during a long sea voyage, but the author hasn't provided bridges between the events he does report. Maturin seems the main character in this one. Hopefully, the next book (and I presume there's one in the works as ""Blue at the Mizzen"" appears only at the next-to-last page of this one) will be better."
3,best of the last half dozen,"The last 6 or so of this series haven't been as good as the others- but with this, hopefully last in the series,O'Brian goes out on somewhat of a high.The series has seemed hastily written & devoid of life- good time to end"
3,So disappointed after waiting so eagerly.,"I have read (and re-read) as well as listened to Patrick Tull's narrations of all the previous 19 volumes in the series and still find excitement, drama, and humor that makes me laugh out loud or say Huzzay! However this book was a great disppointment. It lacked the full involvement of many characters, the humor and the light-hearted exchanges between Aubrey and Maturin. Too much was conveyed through Stephen's over long letters to Christine. Without the war, the battle scenes were boring. I'm sorry to say that after skipping through page after page I finally put the book down and can't bring myself to finish it. But I still gave it 3 stars - O'Brian is the best writer of historical fiction to date and the first 19 novels will always be my favorites. I would love to see PBS do these stories in a television series."
3,Did O'Brian truly write the whole thing?,"I don't know about this one--many of the earlier chapters felt to me as if someone listed all the O'Brian quirks and twists of language and then trotted out the characters and pasted them in here and there. It did not truly sing of Patrick O'Brian. I was disappointed that while Maturin seemingly narrates throughout the book, his usual curmudgeonly and unkempt personality rarely showed. It was ""Stephen Lite"", especially considering losing Diana and dealing with a very distant Jack.(No matter how tired a contrivance it was, I always enjoyed Jack's roaring bad puns, red face and passion for puddings!) The last few books have been less engaging, too, but I heard O'Brian's voice much less in Blue at the Mizzen than in any of them. I realize the trials of age may dim that creativity we have come to expect. I faithfully finished the book (it improved later). I wish Mr. O'Brian well."
3,"Better than Hornblover, but-","Unlike Forrester O'Brian has really done his homework. His books are really informative.Forrerster follows the straight Tory ticket and O'Brian, does not.Of course the Hornblower series started in the thirties when England still had an empire. The Aubrey/Mathurin series on the other hand started in 1969 when England had lost its empire and democracy had become respectable.This is one of the later volumes and not as good as the first."
3,The Stone Diaries...,"An interesting and easy read. I wouldn't put it in the category of one of the great reads in my life, but it was alright. I liked the fact that you followed a character throughout her life and the reality of that life. Not all ups or downs, but a combination that we can all relate to. This was the first Carol Sheilds novel I have read and while I was expecting a little more from someone with such a great reputation, I would read her works again."
3,"Beautifully written, but hollow at the core","I have to agree with the reader who expressed astonishment at the awarding of the Pulitzer to this novel. I did find it to be evocatively written, and enjoyed the decription of the central character, Daisy, in part by how she thinks that others perceive her. Nevertheless, I failed to find Daisy at all compelling. I evaluate the quality of a book by how much it resonates with me after I've done reading it. After I finished ""The Stone Diaries"", it completely disappeared, leaving only a faint sense of disappointment."
3,Very mixed!,"At times, this was an enjoyable, very interesting journey through one woman's life, through each decade of the 1900s. At others, it becomes a little odd, with the tangents about some of the other family members and distant relatives. The writing style switches narrators and tenses quite often, until at the final pages there was a reference made in the first person by a narrator whose name I did not even know. It's never a confusing book, just sometimes frustrating. Overall, the journey through the lives of the characters is special and I did not feel the lesser for having read it."
1,Don't waste your time,"Tediously written, incredibly boring tale of a woman of no particular interest to whom virtually nothing happens. Godawful."
5,Great saga of the 20th century woman,"OK, I'm teach literature, so I'm not your average reader, but Stone Diaries ranks in my top five for modern women's fiction. Be patient with this novel; Shields rewards her readers with terrific insights and humor, and her breadth of knowledge and wisdom is astonishing. I've read it just once, but it remains in prominent place on my overloaded shelves so I can get back to it soon. The other four of my favorite 20th century novels about women: Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway; Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God; Drabble's Peppered Moth or Seven Sisters; and Atwood's Cat's Eye."
4,wonderful recording,"I finally picked up this book-on-tape at my library, after passing it by a million times. I've read a few of the book reviews, many of which I agree with completely (the positive reviews, that is), but I just wanted to add an enthusiastic recommendation of the recorded book. I've never heard Alyss Bresnahan read before--I've since discovered she's read mostly children's books--but I'll be looking for anything she does in the future. She would certainly rank in the top three readers I've ever encountered. The perfect voice for Daisy's story. I keep looking for excuses to drive so I can listen some more."
3,The life story of a woman... enjoyed by a man,"I have no intention of being sexist when I say this, but this is a woman's book. Simply put, it tells the complete life story of a woman entirely from a woman's point of view. However basic I have made it sound, I do want to impress upon you that I was taken by its style nonetheless. It changes and matures with the main character until in the end as Daisy is growing senile, the writing becomes obscure. Her death is told in an 'obituary' format of sorts. I loved this idea. Even though I am not a woman, it helped me get into the character's head and 'live' her life just as she experienced it. Good writing. Worth a Pulitzer prize..? What else was written that year? I'll have to check."
2,Could Be Better,"This is a well-written novel with great imagery and intersting characters. However, the technique that Shields used to abolish characters was instant and unprofessional. All of the characters killed during the novel experienced their demise instantly as if Shields was desperate to discontinue them in the story line."
1,Marked Disgust.,"I am 31 years old and consider myself an avid reader. This book sat on my shelves for over a decade, when, after growing impatient for my next library ""hold"", I picked it up hoping to discover the classic that society and the cover claimed it to be. 137 pages into the book I grew tired of the author's attempt to shock the reader with what I am sure, she thought, was a realistic view of character development. I begged the pages for more, but found mostly boring descriptions that lacked imagination and were evidence enough to know that she had never seen nor contemplated the surroundings she portrayed. Worse? They were interrupted by the occasional sexual obscurities that seemed to plague all of the male characters in her book. Decidedly a waste of time."
1,I just can't believe this crappy novel won a Pulitzer Prize!,"The reasons this novel sucked were many and varied:It was unbelievably, maddeningly slow-paced. The plot and characters were all very boring. The author switches back and forth in time, causing confusion to the reader. The author switches tenses; also confusing. Even for that time period the characters names were all stupid except Daisy. There was very little dialogue and much dull, overblown narration. The novel's pretension and silly names reminded me painfully of a Toni Morrison novel.I wasn't surprised that the audiobook was opened and closed by the stodgy puffed-up voice of George Guidall, but I was disappointed that the usually wonderful Alyssa Bresnahan narrated this colossal waste of time."
3,"Yawn , Yawn , Yawn","The book is sort of a ""Chick Book "" as in ""Check Flick"".Feels something like the airing of the family laundry... with pictures.Passionate about petunias might be an alternative title?The writing isn't at all bad, but the material is aboutvery forgettable people.My mostly California normal familymakes these people seem emotionally retarded.Who are judging this trash as Pulitzer Prize worthy anyway?I had to actually force myself to finish reading it:it kept putting me to sleep."
2,"Grabs your attention, then drones on, and on, and on...","This book starts out as a page turner, but then I found myself turning some pages without completely reading each one. I had to force myself to finish the last few chapters. The first third had a lot of potential, but the story lost it's flair after Daisy gets married for the second time. Skip this one."
1,Author Ever-Present (Too Bad I didn't care for her company),"Every fiction writer must play the role of God. However most writers are subtle about it, silently leading the reader to his own (but also the writer's) conclusion. There is no subtlety in Miss Shields. She hits you over the head with her overly analytical philosophy, and even on some of the most mundane things. Her characters never flushed out as real, but rather paper dolls to look at. I will soon forget I ever read Stone Diaries, but I will never forget Miss Shields."
1,BAD.,"There are certain books you read that make you stop and think: ""Lower than rock bottom. There never was a worse book written. Never."" During those dark times, you gullibly believe that. Then, turn around and there it is!!! A puff of smoke! Magic! Something comes along that's even worse. Such was the case with this novel. Boring, inexcusably long, overly complex, vulgar. To be very eloquent: BAD. Just plain BAD. BAD BOOK. BAD. Um, I didn't like it in case my point wasn't clear. (I'm a traitor to my country!)"
1,You'll hate the protagonist,"The protagonist is sappy. She cannot make a clean decision and when she does you no longer care. The writing was too experimental. It was hard to follow and awkward. The story is completely uninteresting. The title ""Stone Diary"" would've been better because it is essentially the lifestory of a rock. A woman who is boring, writing that is dull and gray, and hard to get through."
2,At least I finished it.,"A book has to be really terrible for me not to finish it and I did get through it...barely. The writing was creative, but the story was just too nowhere and just strange for me. I didn't care about any of the characters...even Daisy. Not enough story, but a creative telling nonetheless."
3,books on tape are good,"It wasn't the best book in the world and it wasn't the worst, but it kept my attention as a book on tape while I filed papers at work. The one thing I didn't understand was that at the begining of the book, Daisy was speaking in first person. After that, the narrator refered to Daisy in 3rd person. If anyone could comment on that for me, please email me at glittergrrrl@juno.com"
4,It's a biography for many ordinary woman around us,"Many people wasn't sure of what's going to happen to him/her and why he/she do cetain things along varies stages of his/her life. The story switches between different perspective (which is one of the theme) simply because though many people intended to be a good mother, daughter etc, she/he really means a different entity to that different people. And this is quite true a fact that this is why a single person have slightly different reaction/action to different people and circumstances.Side notes: The story become much more entertaining after you absorbed the characters after reading it for a while.This is the story of so many ordinary people in the world."
2,Much over-rated and empty at the core!,"The Stone Diaries is a book that seemed wonderfully well-written and engrossing at first. The more I read, however, the less I cared about the characters. Couldn't finish the book and felt that it's praise was undeserved. A very empty book!"
3,The test of time,"There are times, when reading a book, I find myself thinking ""this is just great!"" And sometimes it IS great. Other times distance provides perspective. My book club keeps a list of the books we've read. I like to look back on the books a year later and ask ""do you feel the same way?""I enjoyed this book as I read it, but I didn't think it was ""great"". I thought it very readable. I didn't think the technique always worked. I wasn't totally captivated by the character and her story. I wasn't burning to know what would happen in her life. It was pleasant. A nice summer read.Now I am looking back on the book to see if it has stood the test of time. And I find it an utterly forgettable book. Obviously my tastes are not in sync with that of the Pulitzer Committee"
3,"Wonderful prose, dull story","This is a fictitious autobiography of Daisy Stone Goodwill, born at the beginning of the 20th century and living until the late 90's. I really must be becoming terribly thick as I can't (except for the fluid writing style) think why this book would win a Pulitzer Prize (1995) The lady in question went through her rather ordinary life, raising children, coping with a marriage which, like most, had its ups and downs, and generally just taking one day at a time, one event at a time, without questioning or wondering if that's all there is. I know that when I'm starting to find a book tedious, I tend to rush through it..perhaps that was my mistake, but why linger when nothing's happening..life's too short!"
1,BORING!,"What on earth were the Pulitzer prize folks thinking? There surely were better books written in 1995! Our book club had a tough time getting through this one - in fact some did not finish it. This is an incredibly mundane book about a bunch of dull, humdrum nobodys! I get the ""honor"" of writing our book review each month and usually have no difficulty finding the right words to describe the experience. However, I find I am too much of a lady to say those words for this book experience on a public website! THE END!"
3,nothing much,"This book was so unremarkable, that I have forgotten (really) that I had read it and tried to read it again! It was difficult to understand the Pulitzer Prize, especially compared to other winners. It tells the life of an ordinary woman (a strong woman, but not special), and is written well enough to be read with pleasure and without stumbling, but there is nothing to it. Or maybe I just didn't connect to the characters and events described there. No particular disappointment, but no impact on me whatsoever. I have still to read a book by Carol Shields to get convinced that she is as good as her fame claims."
1,"An extremely slow, boring, confusing book!","This was an extremely dull, uninteresting book to me. I kept on reading it thinking I would surely come to the reason this book was recomended to me---but I did not. I was not able to finish the book either. I would rather be doing anything than reading a dull pointles book."
3,Smashing beginning that dwindles to little stones,"A very able, deft, sensitive writer, whose substance kind of peters out as the book progresses. The first section -- birth, background, mother's death -- is brilliant, outstanding, but there's a gradual decline thereafter as the book chases for meaning. One reviewer describes Shields as having begun as a miniaturist, and her impact doesn't quite hold together as the canvas grows. But the book is well worth reading, if only for that beginning."
2,Unmitigated Boredom,"I am sorry to report that I found this Pulitzer Prize-winning book to be hours and hours of unmitigated boredom. I cannot imagine what the Prize committee was thinking. It was every bit as bad at ""The Hours,"" another prize-winning book not worth the time to read."
5,good seller,I received the book quickly and it was in the condition the seller described it as. Thank you.
3,The Stone Diaries,"Realizing that this book is a Pulitzer Prize winner, I was anxious to read it. I was somewhat impressed with the way it was presented, but I still found the book extremely far fetched even as fiction. There were so many coincidences in the book. It had its moments, but it is not a book I would want to read again."
3,An okay book,"The book started out great, I kept thinking how I would recommend it to my friends and relatives. Lots of reality in this character study of a woman with ups and downs, but got kind of flakey in the final chapters."
3,Disappointing for most of us in our book club,"Most of us were disappointed and left unmoved by this novel. There was no poetry in the language, no excitement, no happiness, nothing admirable in the characters. Only two of us in the book club said that ""Stone Diaries"" was intended to examine a life, and then tell the reader that this ordinariness was valuable; that like Daisy's, there are millions of ordinary lives that are not appreciated. There were mainly two ratings: either a 2 or a 4.5 out of 5."
3,Just ok,"I'm not sure really what to think of this book. The description makes it sound like it is told from Daisy's point of view, but really it is not. It almost like an outsider wrote it that knew everything about Daisy. While I liked the book, I felt next to nothing for Daisy herself. I found those surrounding her to be far more interesting. They gave the story life. Thankfully you get a few clips of the story told from varying viewpoints. I got the most from the letters, etc that are throughout the story. I kept hoping the Daisy would eventually find something to tie her to this world. Most people I think go through life trying to make their mark, something that says they were here long after they're gone. With Daisy it was like she knew she would never been remembered, so why try. She even felt her children and grandchildren would eventually forget about her. She was content to just exist for the moment. It was not depressing, I just felt sorry for her. Still, not a bad story."
4,Symbolism,"Did anyone pick up on the symbolism in this book? Man=stone, emotionally distant. Woman=plant, life. At the end of the story, the granddaughter and grandson are looking for a rock that contains plant life, or the combination of the stone and the plant. How many other symbolic plant/stone references did you find?"
3,an account of different phases every womenencounter,"Reading through the pages of the book is like questioning to myself whether or not I am living my life to the fullest.Whether or not I regretted every decision I so far made.The book which lucidly narrates the life of Daisy Flett gives a refreshing idea to the readers about how our decisions and choices affect our present lives.About how we revolutionized ourselves in every endeavours we embark.It shows the ups and downs of life and makes you wonder about your own perspectives on it.A book like ""The Stone Diaries"" will surely make you review your own life."
4,A THOUGHFUL STORY,"As a man, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this story of women's lives. Some readers might say that the book was not very dramatic. I would agree, but in that regard it is like my life. It made me think about how my life story would sound. The main character also reminded me of my mother who grew up in the Midwest and lived a worthwhile life. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and recommend it to readers who are interested in a thoughtful story"
1,THIS won the Pulitzer??????,"Terribly written and pretentious book. The standards for the Pulitzer Prize in fiction have dropped dramatically. I tried to read this book, but it did not keep my attention. I actually finished, but it never got any better. Experimental trash. Don't waste your time."
3,"Elegant Writing, Dull Story.","With respect to the Pulitzer Prize, one cannot deny that Carol Shield's writing is elegant and highly readable. The story, however, of Daisy Goodwill was not very interesting to me. A fan of historical fiction, it had a true ring to time and place, but I wanted more.Born under extraordinary circumstances to a woman who died in childbirth and either didn't know she was pregnant or simply kept her pregnancy a secret inside her obese body, I felt the story started out with great potential. It's just that the narrator, going in an out of first person, is all over the place with the timeline and it never picked up a sustainable pace compelling me to read on-even after 100 pages.Highly disappointing."
3,Not entertainment,"This was an interesting book. The writing was in depth and well written. This is a story of Daisy from the time of birth to her death. The thing I liked about this book was it was written not only from Daisy's perception, but from the people around her's perception. How she touched each of their lives, what kind of an impact she made on the world, and how the circumstances of her life impacted her. It makes me think of when I die, the things I'll have wished for, the impact I may have had, and if I'm really ready to die. The author does a fascinating job of weaving the characters in and out of Daisy's life.The thing that made this a 3 star only was it didn't ""engage"" me, I like being entertained, and this book was thought provoking, well written but not entertaining."
2,This just didn't capture my attention,"I was not very interested in the story until about halfway through. For a few chapters it was funny, then it lost my interest again quickly. It jumps around and seems to be written from many different points of view. Could have been much more captivating."
4,enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly - it uses a delightful tone of voice that makes you take joy in the ordinariness and simplicity of life: of a garden, of a life-long craft. It is a splendidly crafted book in which Carol Shields shines as a writer.Shields says many things about life, society, and fulfillment in the process, but in the end, this story is simply about the life of an ordinary woman."
2,not quite,"I thought the pictures in the middle were confusing and un-nessecary to the story. I felt that the story she wanted to tell got lost in the story she tried to tell. All in all, it just didn't work for me."
4,Good selection,"I'm really enjoying the selection and the diversity of this CD! I got it yesterday for a birthday gift and am very surprised. Seems like Hillsongs kind of got in a musical rut--but there are several different singers, writters, and styles.... songs are singable and usable in a worship setting which is refreshing. Bridget"
4,Classics are best in some cases!,"I have burned through three different editions of Stone Soup, not liking each one (one had ugly weird illustrations, one was too sappy and rhyming, one was too modern and snotty) until I decided to try out the classic, Caldecott Honor version.WHAT a change. THESE are the classic illustrations most of us grew up with. THESE are the soldiers and the peasants we read about. THIS is the story I'm keeping for my nieces. The telling isn't too clever, or too silly, or too watered-down, or too grown-up. The illustrations are neither too slick or too consciously old-fashioned. (Sheesh, I feel like I'm reviewing Goldilocks here!) I love it, love it, love it!Please remember that this is a bit of a lengthy book for the smaller kids."
4,Entertaining as hell,"Weiss achieves difficult combination of unlikable charachters with sympathetic plights. Hell on Wheels makes you think about your dark side, about what you would do and what you would forgive. Not to mention, it's entertaining as hell. Weiss is a master."
4,Wheelchair bound man reviews his life and circumstances,"Originally published several years ago, this is the story of a man recalling through therapy of sculpture how he became wheelchair bound and his feelings on being a disabled athlete. Very funny and rather sad in places, anyone who enjoyed his Roaches Have No King (a.k.a. Unnatural Selection) book will enjoy it."
5,"GREAT!!! If you want to learn Director, LOOK NO FURTHER!",I got this book the day after ordering it and it has never shut since. I have never used anything from Macromedia before and was intimidated by the complexity of the software. This book broke it down easily without insulting me and I felt immediatly comfortable with the software after the 2nd lesson. After the second day I was able to create multimedia movies that stunned my friends and co-workers. If you want to learn Director get this book and don't think twice. KUDOS!!!!
1,Dissapointed,"Well, I don't recommend this book as it is just a repeat or a restructure at best of the help that comes with Director 7. This makes sense because it's the same people writing the help."
2,Authorized by not the best,"macromedia's Authorized series of books are fine if you must learn by being hand-held through a series of steps throughout. Unfortunately, you miss out on the context of what you're doing if you just follow steps. A much better book, especially for the beginner, is Roberts/Gross's Director X Demystified. That book assumes that you want to learn the whys and not just the by-the-numbers hows of multimedia development. Demystified also covers Lingo in much more depth."
2,Mindless Tutorials,"I bought this book for a class that I was taking in Director. This was the textbook that we used in the class, and after using it, I was not satisfied.This book consists of tutorials that you perform, which increase in difficulty as you progress. However, instead of teaching you Director and Lingo, and how to use them, this book just has you do mindless tutorials. Sure, it tries to explain a few things along the way, but for the most part, you just follow directions, and do the tutorials.I learned a whole lot more about how to use Director and Lingo from Director 7 Demystified. It explained things in clear terms, and taught you how to USE the program, instead of just telling you what to do next for the tutorial. Demystified is also a vast reference for Director and Lingo, whereas once you go through the tutorials in this book, you will probably never come back to it.If you are trying to learn Director, I would definitely go with Director 7 Demystified."
3,Good or Fair book,"Like the one dissenting voice in this collection of rave reviews, i would like to point out that although this is a fair to good book for beginners, it does repeat elements in every chapter ,(representing them as new...as if the chapters were not written consequently) which in the end represents a waste of ink and paper and information for those who have shelled big bucks for this book ($90 Canadian!) However, i did like the book, it did a good job of coddling the reader through the beginning phase of using this program. I just feel a little unhappy that what with the size of this book, and cost, it didnpt impart more in the way of useful information beyond the basics. That said, if one is scared of programs such as director, and apphrehensive of thier skills regarding using a programs such as Director. This is an excellent book for a complete beginner at any type of multimedia program."
5,Very Powerful and Moving,"Ivo Andric possessed a gift that few writers have had. He was able to put historic facts in a readable almost mystifying format that made this book a master piece, even though the word is now terribly overused, The Bridge on The Drina is a master piece and Andric is a masterful story teller as he is a writer. The story that Andric presents is a powerfully moving story and is based on historic fact. It does not only give the reader a better perspective to view the conflicts in the Balkans of the 90's and the recent Kosovo trouble, but it also supplies the reader with a better understanding of a conflict that traces it's roots to the 14th century, that can be used in understanding war's and conflicts based on ethnicity and religions else where."
4,Excellent historical review of the Balkans,Andric does an excellent job in presenting his novel. I engoyed the characters of the story. The book is about a little tiny town called visegrad isolated from the world. The harsh reality of growing countries invade the peaceful town. And at the center is the bridge that spans across the Drina. The citiznes lives revolves around the bridge. With the bridge comes outside influence that will forever change the town.
5,Worthy,"Mr. Andric wrote a masterpiece. I purchased and read this little gem during the Balkan crisis of the 90's and quickly purchased and read The Bosnian Chronicles. Of the two, this book is far superior. For a translation, the language is persuasive and compelling. Very highly recommended."
5,Sublime historic novel!,This work was the first opus to introduce me into Andric world . This Literature Nobel (1960) painted with his admirable and surprising style all the essential moods of his beloved country.He is an author of deep honesty and conviction . Acquire it and I swear you that you will be engaged from the first page.
4,Interesting,"The writing style of this book originally kind of turned me off from it, but at the same time, the Bridge on the Drina is an excellent insight into life in the troubled Balkans. I was especially touched by some of the stories in here, especially the ones that involve the Serb solider going off to war, about to be separated with his girl forever. I was even more happy with the great perspective it gave on life in Bosnia, from the beginning of Turkish rule to the absolute collapse during WWI. Don't even think about talking about Balkan politics if you haven't read this book!"
4,"Epic, but long time span makes it hard to get into any character (except the bridge!)","PROS:- Won the Nobel Prize (so it can't suck).- An epic whirlwind through Balkan history.- Not overtly anti-Turkish/Muslim.- Great symbolism with the bridge.CONS:- Because he covers hundreds of years, there is not one character that sticks through the novel that you can really sink your teeth into.- Reader feels more like a browser - not deeply attached to anyone or anything.- Translation seem awkward at timesCONCLUSION: If you're interested in Balkan history and perspectives, this is a must-read. It's pretty balanced. Those who feel it's anti-Muslim are a bit overly sensitive, so if you are a sensitive type, beware."
5,A Balkan Masterpiece!!,"This book is better than all the recently-written books by the ""Balkan experts"" on former Yugoslavia. Not only does it help us understand the history of Bosnia, but --because it's a great literary work-- it provides us with insights into the human condition."
5,Best book,"Andric,is a bosnian Serb.And he described people and conditions in Bosnia perfectlly.He did research on Bosnian history for 20 years before he wrote this book.He is great Serb writter and Nobel prize winner!"
1,Worst Used Book Yet!!!!,"The book was missing numerous pages which, for a college student, could cost you your grade in a course. The state it was ""acceptable,"" but when a book is missing pages 271-272, and then 281-308...THAT IS NOT ""ACCEPTABLE"" UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, YOU SHOULD NOT BE SELLING A BOOK LIKE THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE! I have bought other used books on Amazon numerous time, but this is the first, I even had to but a new copy just the other day so I can get those pages and be prepared for a paper I will have to write on the book. Never buy from these people unless the guarantee that all the pages are in the book."
3,Not a masterpiece,"This is a serious, even compelling work of historical fiction, but it is not a masterpiece. It is far too episodic, and more importantly, does not fully bring to history the richness and passion and aesthetic power of literature. For example, the putative climax, the destruction of the bridge is extremely weak, even without purpose.There is an interesting parallel (perhaps not coincidental)between the beginning of The Bridge on the Drina and Kadare's The Three-Arched Bridge. It almost seems as if Kadare took elements of the first few chapters of Andric's book and transformed it into what is in fact a literary masterpiece of Balkan history; certainly deserving of the Nobel prize."
2,read carefully,Beautifully written pan-Serbian novel. Not to be read as an unbiased history of the region or a tool for insight into the causes behind the war against Bosnia.
3,I've only just begun,"As he was in the process of dying, a dear friend told me about the stone bridge across the Drina. He was in a sweet, subtle morphine induced state of mind,and his tale about the Drina was compelling, well told, and a perfect metephore for the journey he was now taking...... Once, he had crossed the Drina, read the book and was taken with things that stay, things that remain and prevail. Now, a year later, I am reading about the Bridge on the Drina -- it is dense, heavy with fact, and the voice is thick with Eastern European song. I have put the book down for now, perferring to remember the story of the bridge, of the people, of the country told by my dear friend on a clear winter's night, bedside, a few weeks before his death. But I will pick up the book again, one day. I hope."
4,"historicallly very interesting,i liked it","insight into a time and place i found very compelling, i would recommend it to anyone interested in that period"
5,Author-on-Author,"I am so pleased to see Andri&#263;'s name praised here.While in high school we studied him for 33 hours, and Dostoevsky only a few.Then I have read most of his books - in our language. It is incomparable...I have also crossed THE BRIDGE ON THE DRINA many times. I can still ""see"" the gruesome impaling of Radovan...I remember other stories too: how a long line of people patiently waited for their throats to be cut and their bodies thrown over into Drina red with their blood...That was during the WWII...It is an amazing feeling to see this book here. I am so proud.Thanks everybody for reading and recommending it!"
5,One of the best portrayals of Balkans in literature,"A lifelong Slavicist with particular love for the former Yugoslavia drove me to this book early in my studies of the Balkans. I read the book with no particular appreciation for what I was reading several years ago, and I recently reread it (it is definitely a book that warrants rereading for its attention to detail, its excellent descriptions, and its ability to shed light on the history of the Balkan region-- particularly for those, like me, who are not native to the region.) I traveled to the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Croatia) last year, and after having been there, I gained a whole new appreciation for this book. The most fitting way to describe it is to say that it is vivid, alive, and enduring. I loved it. It tells the story of a noble and fascinating people and culture."
3,"Praise for the book, doubt about the translation","I have the book in the original. Edwards' translation is terrible. He has not only a dubious aesthetic sense, but his grasp of the Serbian language is wanting. In places the translation is literal; in places it is wrong. There is scarcely a line of dialogue translated flawlessly. I recommend keeping all this in mind when reading.On the other hand, Andric's chronicle is all it aspires to be. It is a careful description of the famous Bosnian town where he spent his childhood, the town that hugs the bridge that Mehmed-pasha Sokolovichi built. Naturally, the portion of it which intersects his life, and which consists of the twenty-two years that pass from 1892 to 1914, will be found more interesting than the rest, in my opinion; but Andric knows his weakness, and the bulk of the book lies just in that portion."
1,a great waste of time,"Not an interesting book. Just to respond to few of the reviewers (who are probably servs/serbs) Bosnia is not an artificial creation. It is there to stay whether the servs like it or not. How can someone live with people (such as the servs) whose only cultural legacy is that of terror and ethnic cleansing. Remember Vukovar, Srebrenica and most recently Kosova, just to name a few places where one can learn about servian cultural legacy. By the way Ivo Andric was not a serv he was a Croat"
1,Great looking paperweight,I have numerous Colibri lighters (I collect as well as use) and only 1 that continues to function properly. In other words they don't light. I take very good care of my things and use high quality triple refined butane. I have an Edge that I paid $90 for and after 9 months quit working. I sent it back for service and because I didn't have my receipt I had to pony up $69 to have it repaired. Six months later it quit working? Needless to say I will never buy another Colibri lighter again!
4,a must for tom waits fans.,"this is a thoroughly enjoyable book consisting of all things tom waits: interviews, reviews, articles, and such. mr waits comments on his approach to songwriting were the most consistently interesting aspect of the book for me and should be of great interest (for freshness of/and or off-kilter approach to song building) to all aspiring songsters. lacking a biography or autobiography, the world, for now, will have to make do with this well done book for an insight into this amazing artist."
4,If Tom's Work Intrigues You....,Tom Waits is enigmatic and flies under the commercial music radar. His work is interesting and deals with a part of life few people really care to discover. It's cool to read anything about Tom and try to discover what makes him tick. He's a human-interest story. The thing I think is weird about the book is that it seems most of the authors adopt a writing style imitative of Wait's work. It makes the authors seem pretentious and unauthentically(word?) bohemian. It is interesting reading because of the subject matter.
5,Great idea!,"Ah ha! This is a nice book idea. Tom Waits is a genius and has been for a very long time -- which I now know because of this compilation of pieces about him. It's well thought out and nicely put together. Oh, and there is a foreword by Frank Black -- another genius in my opinion."
4,Fine Product but...,"I purchased six of these from Amazon along with four of the double pull outs and a wastebasket pull out. All were well built, strong and (for the most part) easy to install. I would caution the homeowner to watch out for the leading edge of the rack closest to the cabinet door. This edge is sharp steel and if the door is not open 90 degrees or more, will gouge the wood. I solved this by gluing strips of felt to the leading edge where it would hit the door but I think the manufacturer should have included rubber bumpers for that location."
4,Corelli and Tebaldi toghether,"If you like Corelli, don't hesitate to get this. If you like Tebaldi, don't hesitate to get this. If you like both of them, then of course don't hesitate to get this. This is a glimpse at two legends on stage together. Past their prime? Yes. But even at that there is enough left over for some really beautiful sounds. Just listen to Corelli in ""O bell'occhi di fata"" or ""Sogno soave"" how he caresses the words. The sound is noisy but it quiets down when the singing starts and is quite listenable.Don't listen to the other reviewer. He is obviously not a fan.I gave it 4 stars because of the noisy sound."
4,"Progress Lighting P3539-42, Searbrook","It's looks great. It's very detailed, and not that golden, so I like it that way.Like others, I did not like the fact that it's made from plastic( I gave it 4 stars for that reason), but one can hardly tell."
2,"Terrible, but it gets the job done...decently.",This rack just arrived today and it was a PAIN to put together. The instructions were cheap too. I wouldn't recommend setting it on carpet because it's incredably wobbly. Some of the bars on the shelves are bowing upward too.This is not what I had expected but it gets the job done I guess. I have about 50 CDs on it right now and it's sitting on a big piece of tile.I'd recommend looking at other media storage racks and not this one.
5,A good book of California life.,The collection of short stories covers a view of California life at the time of writing - especially in the rural areas.
5,One Of Steinbeck's Best,"I purchased The Pastures Of Heaven because I never read this book and heard that it was good. I understand that The Pastures of Heaven is one of his best works. I don't think there is a bad John Steinbeck book. I have read most of his works and have enjoyed every book. I love Steinbeck's characters and the time and location of his stories are always interesting and entertaining. The feeling, style and language of the 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's are perfectly captured in his books. There is always a moral or biblical tie in his novels and it's fun to try to figure out the real plot of the novel. I am looking forward to reading this book and know that it will be a work of art."
5,A great collection of thoughts,Steinbeck at his best.This is a collection of short stories loosely connected that paint a picture of a California slowly maturing from its infancy to its adolescence.Well worth the read.
4,good reading,"This book is about the author's life among reindeer herders in Siberia. It mostly documents the devastating results of collectivization on their culture, especially family life. With the fall of Communism, the situation has not changed appreciably, as their lives are irrevocably disrupted and they still suffer from bureaucracy. One is left with a profound sadness at the herder's situation. The book is well-written and the author is obviously sympathetic to the native peoples and their plight."
1,For a very very limited audience,This book is NOT like a novel it's like a textbook. You will not find this interesting unless you have a liking to caribou.
3,Napoleon and Josephine,"The illustrations in this paper doll book are lovely and colorful, reflecting the return to luxury after the horrors of the French revolution.It's a pity that the paper used is not card, but rather softer paper with card used only for the cover and dolls.The costumes are well drawn with great attention to detail, however Josephine has a pregnant silhouette, which was not the shape of women's fashion during the time. The preganant look is ironic since the reason Napoleon divorced her was her inability to conceive a child by him."
4,Good gloves,"I like these gloves very much. They are light, fit very well, and very comfortable. You don't loose very much feeling from wearing them. 85% cow hide leather, 5% nylon, 5% aeroprene, 5% syn leather. Lining 100% polyester. All the protection on the knuckles and fingers is foam based and flexible. I have not taken a spill on them yet but they should do the job nicely. Made in china. You always get what you pay for. But I think these are a good value. They are much more expensive at my local stores."
2,Okay they nice,With in one week the wrist area was getting tore from me just trying to put them on. The palm area does seem like there is enough protection. They do breath well and are not that great in the cold wind. It was an impulse buy and I will not be buying another Joe Rocket Product.
3,Deadly Dull But Essential,"I had a hard time rating this book since it is so incredibly, teutonically dull, but at the same time I don't want to sell my copy since it is chock full of the kind of detail that serious students of the history of WW2 require. So as a reference book it is 5 star while as entertainment it has no stars, hence the compromise of 3 stars overall. Read ""Condemned to Live"" by Franz Frisch or Hans Von Luck's ""Panzer Commander"", among many others, if you are interested in the experiences of German soldiers in WW2. Keep this one on the shelf along with Manstein's ""Lost Victories"" if you are a serious student of military history and need some heavy detail and your German isn't up to reading the original after action reports and reams of other documents that the Wehrmacht left behind."
4,Useful reference book,"As like others, I also recommend this text for it's overall content and subject matter. This is a helpful reference book for daily engineering applications. But - users should be aware that there are some basic mistakes in the book. The book is very user friendly to locate formulas and items. Address; the technical mistakes, and I would give if a five star rating."
4,Still useful,"Wasn't acceptable for book return at my school, so bear that in mind before purchasing. Still using this after graduation as reference."
2,Downhill,"Roark would turn over in his grave if he reviewed what Young and Budynas have done to his fine work. Roark, 4th Edition is the last of his works. The tables were clear and easy to read. If you can find one, new or used, I would strongly recommend a 4th Edition copy."
3,Junior does not have the quality that senior had.,"While this volume is about 30% larger than my 5th edition, it has some glaring errors. When you get pointed to a table, you will not find tables with that number. The tables are titled but not numbered according to the referring item. Major PITB trying to figure out if the table that I found was the correct one."
5,Well Thought Out Upgrade from Previous Editions,"I have three editions of this book: the classic 4th edition, the useless 5th edition and this, the 7th edition.The 4th edition has simple format, is easy to use, but lacks methods for more sophisticated hand analyses and is sparse on explanations. The 5th is best used for a doorstop.This edition is an excellent combination of the usefullness of the 4th edition with modern and more advanced methods.The layout of each section has excellent explanatory material and provides the simple 4th edition type equations backed with more involved/advanced formulas which are very useful.My hat is off to the authors. This is probably the best reference for those nasty stress and deflection hand calculations we all have to do from time to time."
5,Excellent resource,Roark's has been and remains an excellent resource for the structural engineer and designer regardless of the edition. This is a referance I use on a daily basis. Typically the first book I reach for.
5,Lots of fun,These dishes were perfect for adding a little fun to dinner. They looked even better than the pictures.
4,Book review,"This book is very good. It is historical accurate about the fall of the Persian Empire. At the beginning of the book, it is very long but detail of the main character and his past life. It has a great detail of his new life and how he must live. You can really relate to the character because he has an array of emotions and other strong feelings. The book makes you feel that your are their because the main character describes all the battles and the palaces and the situation he in to survive and meet new friendsI give this book to thumbs up for being really detailed and a great connection with the main character"
5,History was never so sexy,"Before you see the two movies about Alexander the Great, especially the lush-looking Oliver Stone one (the exotic Angelina Jolie plays Alexander's mother), read this boo kas well as PLUTARCH'S LIVES, from which much of the good gossip about Alexander is taken.In Mary Renault's richly woven novel with words that conjure up ancient battlefields and royal boudoirs, Alexander the Great's sandal tracks come to us by way of his eunuch lover, Bagoas, who as a Persian has to contend with Greek arrogance, Alexander's marriage to Roxane, and most of all with Al's more educated lover Hephaestion--as Nathan Lane quipped in ""The Birdcage,"" ""Talk about gays in the military!""Bagoas, torn from his family and without a formal education, nevertheless becomes a wise observer and chronicler of Alexander's exploits, and more importantly the very human side of the man. A beautiful tender love story and retelling of history."
4,Heroic portrait of a hero.,"There are many interpretations of Alexander the Great, from an alcoholic megalomaniac & murderous military genius at one extreme to Mary Renault's interpretation at the other. But whether Mary Renault's interpretation is the right one or not is beside the point. Her poertrayal is entirely convincing within the limits set by her, and her Alexander and his supporting caste is entirely convincing. Being true to the inner world of her novels makes her a great historical novelist. Hence I reccommend highly her trilogy (particularly this and the previous one). Those interested in a contrary interpretation should try Peter Green's biography 'Alexander of Macedon', also an excellent read."
5,One of my favorites!,"I love this book. Mary Renault is a serious scholar of Alexander the Great but also writes historical fiction based on historical characters and events of the times. The Persian Boy is Bagoas, a Persian eunech. We follow Bagoas through his family's demise and his subsequent castration to his elevation as the Great King Darius' concubine. After Darius' assassination at the hands of traitorous friends, Bagoas is taken to meet Alexander. He becomes his lover and friend and follows Alexander until his death. This is a richly written novel, full of description and lively characters. It is one of my favorite novels of the last 10 years and I recommend it highly!"
5,Excellent and touching.,A very well written book which grabs the reader and won't let go until the last page. This will be one of those books that I will re-read many times over the course of my life.
3,Okay read,"So I finally snatched this novel off my friend's shelf and read the old tethered paperback. It was a sloggish go at first. I tried three times, finally had enough time to sink my teeth into it. I'd say better about it if I didn't feel that I was being written down to. I suppose the erudite style might work for some seeking higher end literature--and I can certainly understand the desire for that with the slew of poorly written novels out there today--but this was the other extreme. Wish I could have liked it more."
4,"Outstanding 5th, Dull 6th","Way back in 1990 I bought my first CD player and a few minutes later I bought this CD. I really cannot believe that I am the first person to review it. Anyway, this CD has a great performance and a mediocre one. The great one is the 5th Symphony by Kurt Sanderling. It has tremendous forward momentum, beautiful lyricism when needed (slow movement) and great passion. And unlike the famous Carlos Kleiber recording, the slow movement is not rushed. The Pastoral is quite dull, although well played. But for the very low marketplace price, this CD is well worth it."
2,Disappointing.,"I was completely taken in by the rave reviews Sanderling's performance received, both here and elsewhere. What I heard sounded glib and superficial where it should be weighty; ponderous where it should take flight. Normally I would recommend Sanderling's work without a second thought, but he was definitely having an off day here.Perhaps because of lowered expectations, I didn't find the Kegel performance as disappointing. No thrills, but nothing I would call bad, either. In fact, I thought it got better as it went along; the last two movements were pretty good.Oh, well, at least the CD didn't cost me very much."
4,Bolo The Ghetto Child: So Much Pain,"Bolo could never have had any exposure, as this album is not well known and has been overlooked. Personally, I commend him for his effort on this one. Bolo is a real rapper with consciousness, and he can kick a decent rhyme or two. He flips lyrics of ghetto tales, anger, love, struggle, dreams and ambitions... and in a way, he touches you... He reminds me of 2pac in some ways with how his lyrics touch, yet Bolo is on a different level. The beats are not the usual, he is from Nashville TN, but a couple of the beats have a kind of New York sound to them. Regardless of how I can possibly describe them, they are nice the whole way through, and overall this is a tight, slept on example of a fine hip hop album that's on a conscious gangsta level. Definately pick it up if you get the chance, because it's worth your time."
2,No better than the first one.,This book was no better than the first version. Don't waste your money you're not missing anything.
3,PLEASE NOTE THE COPYRIGHT DATE,"Remember that ISC2 rewrote the exam in 2007/2008 - I'm not sure that this book is the most up-to-date version of their exam guide. Do your homework, which I can see you've already started by reading these reviews.New changes to the test are also forthcoming - do a google search or check out the Shon Harris blog on Amazon.Best of luck in achieving your certification!"
4,"Great overview, a few bugs though","This is a great overview of the CBK, presented by experts in each domain. The quality is good overall, but some of the chapters are a little choppy and contain typo and consistency errors (these are few and far between, though). The material is presented as a scholarly writing (as it should be) and isn't really appropriate for someone brand-new to the security field. This serves as a great reference guide for a CISSP (especially for the wealth of references in Law and Ethics domain)."
3,Window Lock - normal shiping method Fed Ex ??,"This lock cost only a dollar however the ""normal"" shipping method is automatically Fed ex costing $6. I could not find this little handy lock in my town of San Diego, Ca where I looked in 4 different well known home improvement & home discount type stores. Received in 3 days in fine shape ordered one other lock. Make sure to check window measurements or the lock may NOT fit.Flo"
4,Good Purchase,I bought this as gift for my wife as she enjoys the program. The first and 3rd seasons played fine on my DVD player and are fine. The second season discs would not play on my DVD player though. From looking at the covers on each DVD it appears they are a recorded set not an original. I was however able to play them on my PC which is hooked up to my HDTV so we watched them that way but the quality was poor and not HD. We are still enjoying the third season. For the price of all three seasons it was worth it.
5,Heros,These were a birthday present for my husband and he opened them even before I got home. They were shipped much earlier than expected. Thank you! Still shrink wrapped and all!
3,Comet (Doomsday Journals),"Yes I would recommend it because it is easy to understand, and it is easy to get into. It is about a professor named Andrew Wolinski, and he made up this theory about comets, but no one would believe him. He finally proved them wrong after he was dead"
5,Great Slipper,I purchased the slippers last year and they have held up very well. They are comfortable and I wear them all the time even outside. They are well made and I think it will last a long time.
5,moccasin slippers,I have been very pleased with my slippers. They are easy to step into and have been very durable. Not one negative comment.
4,Quite Nice,"These slipper shoes seems true to size, and they look quite good once the lace is darkened with a permanent magic marker; otherwise there is too much contrast and they look cheap. Once the laces are darkened, they look good."
4,comfort on a shoestring,"Shearling is cushier and the laces are thin & patently pseudo rawhide. Nonetheless these slippers are comfortable, light weight and good looking. If they only last a couple of years and need a spenco insert for better padding, they are still a bargain. Would (will) buy again anytime."
1,Break just looking at them,"I cannot believe what I have been through trying to buy slippers for my husband. After searching several department stores, I finally found these. With wide width available they were a perfect fit. He had them for about a week when they ripped at the lacing, causing a large hole in the top of the shoe near the toe. I returned them and had a second pair sent. I thought maybe there was just a defect in the first pair.He had the second pair about a month, with little wear, maybe an hour or so a night. This time the lacing broke at the bow. Now the lacing has loosened and is coming out of the grommets. He had to tie it back together just to keep it from falling apart.I will definitely be returning these and DO NOT WANT ANOTHER PAIR. Going to try Lands End now."
4,"Nice product, good price...","It was a little difficult to gauge the proper size, so mine ended up being a little loose. Still, they are a pretty close fit despite the guessing. They are comfortable, warm, and have a useful amount of traction on surfaces like a kitchen floor. Beyond that... *shrug* Definitely satisfied with the value for money so far. If it lasts for a couple of years I'd upgrade the rating to five stars."
1,Not cushy enough,I bought these for my husband but they just weren't as comfy as I hoped. I've sent them back and found another pair for half this price and much more comfortable.
2,15 months - rawhide lace broke,"Whoever heard of a rawhide lace breaking? It broke in two places. I have been wearing moccasins for about 35 years, and have never experienced a broken lace before. Unfortunately, nobody in my area has rawhide laces, so now the moc's are basically unusable, as without the lace it flops around as I walk."
4,Runs big,My boyfriend is 12 but he is swimming in the size 12. I got the wide version but didn't think that would make the length any different.
4,yay,"These slippers are terrific...sturdy sole, soft inside. AND they arrived just DAYS after I ordered them. thanks. I would buy more."
4,like very much,"have never been much of a slipper guy, but now at 62 yo look for the easy way..plus being daibetic, these make the nurses happy."
2,Cheap quality for a slipper that's not cheap,"I was excited when the slippers arrived, but they were a huge let-down. Everything except the uppers, even the ""leather"" strings are fake. I'm okay with synthetic materials, but I expect to be able to tie a bow in my new shoe strings without breaking them. They broke the instant I gave a tug to tighten the bow. It wasn't a hard tug. That's when I noticed they don't even look real. The lining looks fake as well, and looks like it would wear out in no time. They just don't look or feel like high quality, and with stuff breaking within 20 seconds of my putting them on, I felt sort of ripped-off. With this experience, I contacted Amazon and arranged a return. UPS just picked them up, and my experience with Amazon, at least, has been good. I just ordered a different slipper that costs a little more and made in USA instead of China. I was tempted to rate these slippers 1 star but I was feeling generous today."
2,Split Seams - Unhappy Hubby,"I have bought these slippers in Navy for a few years, but this last pair has split at the seam near the toe area. My husband had probably only worn them for three weeks...can't return them now. He can still get a little wear out of them, but he is very disappointed. Not sure where to find a suitable match in Navy without paying alot more, but most likely will not buy these again for fear of the same thing happening again."
2,fall apart,We have purchased these slippers for several years and were always happy with them until this year. They changed the cording that weaves the front of the slipper together. Both of the new pairs we bought fell apart after a couple of weeks of use. The suede was cut too small to handle the larger laces.
1,"Ripped - January 6, 2007",I purchased these slippers for my son as a Christmas present. The stitching ripped through the suede after ond day of wear. I am very disappointed.
4,slippers,These slippers are ok! Since they cost 14.99 I did not expect too much. Fit was tight at first. absolutely no arch support. but thats ok!
1,Had to return it,"My father wears slippers that are much too long for him; I live in fear that he'll fall down the stairs due to their excessive length. Unfortunately, these slippers, like every other pair I've tried to purchase for him, were too narrow in spite of their 5E width. I hope I can find something for him before he is injured. At 85, he can scarcely afford a fall due to too-long slippers."
1,"Fatal Flaw - ""Rawhide Lacing"" breaks immediately","UPDATE:I bought brown rawhide laces on ebay (color doesn't match exactly). I can pull as hard as I can on them and they don't break.It's NOT easy to thread the new rawhide through the holes, especially the four holes on the top of the shoes where they get tied.Buy 18"" or 24"" laces to replace the junk they came with. 12"" is probably too short, but they can be ""knotted"" (not nicely tied) if that's all you have.I wouldn't buy these if I were you.---------------------------------I don't know if the lacing in this is real or fake rawhide, but it breaks as soon as you pull on it slightly.Without the lacing that goes around where you put the foot in the shoe, it's VERY loose and can't be worn.I suppose I can try to find some laces somewhere, but this is crazy. You'd think there would be SOME quality control. There is none."
4,They were a gift.,"I have no idea how they fit or how they are holding up, but the recipient was pleased when he saw them."
2,Moccasin slipper for a gift,These slippers are well made and great for the price. I originally bought them because they were listed as having a EE width but they are not any wider than the ones found in the stores with a regular width.
4,Sol Weinstein's First,"This was the first in a long string of Borscht Belt parodies created by Sol Weinstein (not his real name) in the 1960s and 1970s. Here, his creation Israel Bond naviagtes some treacherous territory as he uproots the enemies he only wished he had...The style was inimitable. We can only hope for a continuation of this tradition in the future."
3,a bit too much at times,"An entertaining book! Miller is probably the most cynical person in the universe. Only problem I had with the book is that this author rants on in a mystical sort of way every now and then, and then it spans a few pages at a time. I found these ""rants"" incomprehensible, I did not care for them."
3,"not what I expected, Boring","I had heard and read that this was an inspirational boo depsite the vulgariy and sex. I found it boring witha lot of nonsense. There was some vulgariyty and sexual description which at the time may have bordered onpornography. There were some comments on corporate Americ and America in general that hold true today. Not a coming of gae story or inpirational as I had expected. Boring and slow read. I give it a n ok rating only because it was very cheap,\."
2,Not what I expected,"Although this is suppose to be a classic, I struggled to get through it. The plot is boring and may have been exciting 50 years ago. Not what I expected."
3,I struggled... but I get it,"I get why people love this book and I understand why some do not. I am exactly in the middle. There are times where Miller's story telling is completely engaging and there are other times when his rants are too cumbersome and egotistical. I told everyone how much I disliked the book and then realized that I was talking about this book more than most I have read. It definitely hits a cord and like most great books, it makes you think. This book is provocative and based on the period of time, it is amazing that Miller was so advanced. I will read this book again and see if it has a different impact on me...."
3,Tropically boring,"I bought this because James Frey said it was such an influential book for him, but I just couldn't get into it. It has stood the test of time -- so maybe this is not the review you should count on to purchase!"
3,Definitely not for everyone!,"It's fascinating and a wonderful read but most people won't enjoy the anti-America commentary and many women find the graphic sexual content offensive. It is also not a masterpiece as far as a plot. For the most part it doesn't really have one. I, myself, throughly enjoyed reading it for about 3/4 of the book but after awhile I began to lose interest in the character."
2,A narcissistic book,"The first chapter is extremely long and simply dedicated to words and flaunting himself. Mr. Miller admits he loves words and he sure does, too bad he does not have the same love for plots. The second chapter is a teenager-like bragging of his sexual exploits, for which he loses his gift for words as the most common are 4-letters either to describe the act itself or the female anatomy. It's all about HIS pleasure. No concern about HERS. My guess is that his bragging is based on insufficient experience or he would find the long descriptions he reserves for the city buildings and cornices. But then, I admit I did not read to the end."
2,has not held up into the 21st century,"looking back during the period of time when Miller wrote this may have invoked more of a edgier feel for thebook. analageous to hearing lenny bruce today, miller doesnt shock or hold the attention for me these days. more of a description of life in brooklyn and manhattan and a distance from some of the sexual stuff would have this book a better read."
1,What is the point of this book?,"I am 17 and I got this book at the school library. I have found three main themes the author seems to be putting out: the main character tells the story of a tragic death, the main character complains incomprehenisibly about America, the main character rates the female anatomy in relation to it's personality. This book has absolutely no plot or even a story line, it is simply the ramblings of a sexually disfunctional person."
5,The magic filling,"Elbert, a slightly-built boy, receives a filling from his dentist that is made of a new alloy. The filling acts as a receiver for radio stations at first, then develops into mind reading. This is the story of a 14 year old boy who has big dreams to play football. Because of his size, the coach doesn't even consider putting him on the team. But with injuries and Elbert's own perserverance, his dream comes true."
1,The blue bleeds,"I wore this shirt one time. When I washed it, the blue from the shoulders bled all over the white of the shirt. It looks awful and I will never be able to wear it again. What a waist of money!"
5,Vintage science fiction.,"Classic 1950 space fiction, with foreword by Martin Greenburg, introduction by Willy Ley, and including stories by Manly Wade Wellman, Robert Moore Williams, Lewis Padgett, Harry Walton, A. E. Van Vogt (""Far Centaurus""), Hal Clement (""Cold Front""), and Murray Leinster."
1,A Boring and Confuse book,"I'm very disapointed with this book. It's very, very boring. When she stop describing the place and beggins the story, you're almost sleeping... Then, when the story envolves you, She jump 30 years and start all the description again, with the son's and daughters of the first couple. I really don't like it. I'm disapointed because I LOVED all Janet Dailey's books (well, til now)."
5,THE GREAT ALONE,"Have read it several times and lost my copy. I enjoyed it even more re-reading it. RB Port Huron, Mi"
5,Stunning,"The author excels on all levels. His description is not only accurate but lyrical; his characters are finely drawn; the plot is intricate and complex. The intent is clear: the missionaries are portrayed as being self-righteous and hypocritical. Only the child can make the true connection with the natives, and he becomes a sacrificial lamb. Moon emerges as an Adam figure, seeking his destiny and finding it at last by losing himself in the universe. What a magnificent book!"
3,magnolia,"It was disappointing to find commercials included in the DVD that I purchased. They should have been edited out. The extra time could then have been better used to show more of the area or more comments on pairing the food and wine. I understand commercials on TV, but I resent having to buy them."
2,disapointed,"For the price of this dvd I wasn't impressed at all. I have several in my collection including Windsor Pilates and 10 Minute Solution; with varying degrees of intensity. I was looking to increase the effectiveness of my workout and already own one foam roller dvd that is very intense. When I received this DVD I was very disapointed; the reps are so short that by the time you start to feel anything the instructor moves onto something else. I think that out of the entire workout there was one exercise that felt like it was working. I would've GLADLY returned it if I could have, but DVD's can only be returned unopened. Don't waste your money, and by a less expensive/more effective DVD!"
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"10 CD's of beautiful pieces of classical music, digitally recorded for only 20 bucks sounds very good. I decided to buy this CD set because of very good price. But, what you will get for your money? Noting special, believe me! I was very disappointed with some performances, but sound quality of some tracks is even worst. Disc No. 6 is one of the most poorly recorded and engineered CD's I have ever heard. I can't believe that this CD is digitally recorded. So, forgot price and look somewhere else. I can recommend this CD box set to absolutely beginners only."
1,Stone Fell Out,"The ring looks nice - the spinning action is kinda fun - but the stone fell out within the 1st week - and looked like other stones were shortly to fall out as well...i was surprised because i have never had a problem with Silver Insanity's quality of goods before - but they responded quickly to my claim and offered either refund or exchange. Although, I AM upset that I have to pay to ship it back. This is a defective item and they should've offered to pay the shipping."
3,"looks great, may fail quickly, and could damage your laptop","I purchased two of these items. The item looks great and does work. That gets it 2 stars. If the laptop sits on a solid surface and the cord/plug sits straight behind it and you do not unplug/plug/move the laptop or connection then it should squeak by at the bare minimum level. The cord and strain relief at the connections are flimsy and will fail quickly. More concerning is the plug you push into the computer. The plug wobbles in the socket and sits at a slight angle when connected. My concern is that it is going to damage the laptop socket. This far outweighs any benefit you may get from it. Maybe as an emergency, ""use and toss"", and that is a weak maybe."
1,Defective Charger,I ordered a charger for my Vaio and worked for 2 days. After that the thing does not even light up. Terrible quality. Please do not buy this kind of charger spend a little more money and get the original. The return cost will be more than the price I paid for this product.
2,cheap,the cord from that goes from the the wall to the black box failed after two weeks. at least it only costs $5 on amazon for a replacement for that!
1,Didnt work for me,"When i this arrived i plugged it in and the light on the charger turned on, but when i plugged it into my laptop nothing happened i left it plugged in for an hour and nothing happened. i returned it and got my money back."
1,Would not buy from this seller again!,I had the adapter for two days and the cable cover pulled away from the ends. I have had to buy another one already.
4,Outstanding,Works just like it was advertised its got me up and running. I will be sure to pass the word this is where chargers should be bought.
1,Cheap product,"This charger was fine for about two weeks. Despite the very short cord, it did work. Then it stopped charging suddenly and hasn't worked since. A very cheap product that is not even worth the low price that you pay."
1,bad!,none of the parts fit together! the plug that goes on the wall doesnt fit on the charger and the part that plugs into the computer fell apart...
1,Not the product in the picture. DO NOT BUY!,The first one I bought just several weeks ago caught on FIRE and melted down in 1/2 almost catching my carpet on fire with it. Electrical order that filled the house was horrible and had to throw it out the back door.I ordered another mistakenly thinking it was the picture displayed and not realizing it was the same company for 3 times the price of the first one. It is a generic charger that says replacable and is nothing they advertised from pic to description. I'm really upset!!! in attempts to contact them now and haven't got a response yet. Gonna have to wait until MOnday to call directly. I've never had an issue on Amazon with any purchases and I buy frequently on other products. This was a complete LIE!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QC7OZG/ref=ox_ya_os_product
1,Terrible,This thing is not what they advertised--it looks completely different from the picture. It doesn't fit right in the laptop and only works if you jiggle it around some and have it in a certain position. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE GUYS! It may cost less but it won't work well for your laptop. I even e-mailed to see if I could return it and they never responded.
1,Lasted less than 90 days,"I bought this November 2, 2010. It died tonight (January 19, 2011). Less than 90 days...garbage! It didn't even fit properly into the laptop when it DID work!"
1,Don't DOit,"SUCKS. REally sucks. Fourth Sony Vaio Charger to have crapped out on me...but the people at Sony don't care. I hope this message finds you before you buy a Sony Vaio or a charger, although I don't know what to do now that my computer won't work after two Amazon purchases."
3,"Same title, different record","This CD is not, as indicated, a reissue of the 1962 LP, ""The Queen Of Country Music."" The songs are completely different, although they may be tracks taken from the 'Sixties... But they are definitely not the same songs that were on the original album."
1,Leave a classic alone!,"I bought this DVD because I wanted the Popeye cartoons I watched as a child. What I got was cartoons with cheap sound effects dubbed over the top. Why in the world would anyone want to add ""surround sound effects"" to a Popeye cartoon? It's not the Matrix, it's Popeye! The added sounds are at a higher volume level than the original backround soundtrack. They are extremely noticable and very annoying. The ironic part is the left surround channel is softer than the right and often cuts out completely. You're better off waiting until a ""pure"" version is released on DVD or get it on VHS. What a waste of money."
1,Ditto!,I just want to second the motion that this DVD is a waste of money. I think the team that put this audio track together checked out a special effects record from their local public library. The stuff is unecessary and sounds terrible.
1,"Wait, Warner Brothers WILL restore Popeye in 2007!",Warner Brothers is in the process of restoring the classic B&W and Color Popeye Cartoons for a July 31 2007 DVD release. Original Paramount main & end titles will be a part of the restoration. All mastered from pristine 35mm nitrate negatives (with original soundtracks).
3,Not my favorite Barefoot Contessa book.,"I absolutely hate to give anything than a 5-star review for an Ina Garten book but I didn't love this one and not because I didn't love the recipes. I presumed that this book would be more focussed on finger foods, cute canapes and serving large groups of people, such as the recipes inMartha Stewart's Hors d'Oeuvres Handbook. Most of Ina's other books seem to serve 8 people and this one is no different, serving 8 people is not that hard, it's the 20 plus parties that I find tricky! I'm always looking for new books for large crowds and this one isn't that book, unless of course you can afford to serve full sized lobster rolls for 40..."
5,Love this cookbook!,I really love this cookbook. I have been reading some reviews about the high temperatureand smoke coming from the oven. this is actually a wonderful technique for roasting meats that many chefs know about. You MUST make sure that you have an impecably clean oven!
4,Barefoot Contessa Parties!,"We haven't had Ina on TV here in Australia for that long, but she is gathering a huge following. Loved the recipes in the book but thought the book would contain more helpful hints, surely she has learnt many valuable trouble shooting/time saving/setting up techniques over the years. The book was good though, I would recommend it for anyone looking for a great collection of her wonderful recipes. Lesley Garard Queensland Australia."
2,Fun but intimidating,"She's a lively writer and her general attitude (don't work so hard that you nod off during the main course) is surely welcome. But there's little here for those of moderate means. Can you afford beef tenderloin for eight? And who eats this much, anyway? If you've got more splash than cash, try Prue Leith's Dinner Parties."
4,This is now my 2nd favorite cookbook!,"It doesn't top her first book, but boy, it's close! My only complaint about the book is that it's a little hard to find the recipes by category (looking for an entree? you'll have to search under poultry, seafood, etc... in the index) so I give it 4 stars, not 5. However, there is no complaint about the recipes themselves! Just like in her first book, everything I've made from this has turned out beautifully. AND, as a bonus, that beautiful looking lemon cake pictured in the dessert trays from the first book, but sadly not listed as a recipe, is included in this book. Ina Garten is my hero! I only wish the Barefoot Contessa store wasn't on the other side of the country."
2,you shouldn't believe your own success,"First off, yes, I like Ina Garten's books--and her cooking. Most of the recipes here are simple; the food, satisfying. But this book is too enamored with its own success. Most egregious are the listed recipes that are not found in the book, but are simply referenced to her first book. Savvy marketing, no doubt. It makes sure you buy both books. But irritating, nonetheless. And there's just so much rank sloppiness going on. The party for twenty? Look at the yield in the recipes--some are for 6 people, some are for 8, others, more. So what do you do if you're indeed having twenty over? Someone, I think, just slapped together a bunch of recipes and thought, well, we're already a success. Why sweat the details?"
5,"Barefoot Contessa ""Parties""","I own all of the Barefoot Contessa Cookbooks. How can anyone go wrong with Ina Garten's recipes? It is impossible to goof with her easy to follow instructions, excellent ingredients and books!Looking forward to the delivery of her latest November 2012, ""Foolproof"" to add to my library.Parties is a wonderful collection of just the right dishes to serve at home or to bring to a friend's home. I've been cooking my way through her books, and have a very happy hubby to prove it! ""Parties"" is one of my favorites!I wouldn't hesitate purchasing this book. Cooking these recipes makes me look really good as a home cook to my family and friends, as they really enjoy what I serve!"
1,Don't bother,Beautiful book with lots of great pictures of old recipes. I didn't find one recipe that I would make that I don't already. It is an older book and there are plenty of more up to date books that reflect the newer trends in food.
3,Planning to visit the Hamptons?,"There are some good recipes in this book. There are also several that require exotic ingredients not easily found in the Midwest, where I live. As for the party suggestions, it turns out that Ms. Garten holds parties in the Hamptons, supplied by her specialty cooking store. No one I know is going to have a party that remotely resembles hers, including me. The book may be worth the Amazon price for the handful of really good recipes. Don't look to it for party planning -- if you want this kind of a shindig, hire a caterer."
2,Not necessary for library,"Although I have enjoyed the beautiful photographs in her new cookbook I was disappointed in the cooking portion. It is not a book the serious cook would need for their bookshelf. Many of the recipes are variations of those found in her friends homes and restaurants. I was looking for a more original approach to her entertaining and found it lacking. Unfortunately it appears to have been written for her fame rather the cooking. With only 84-85 recipes in the entire book, I would have hoped to find something besides 'Mac and Cheese'."
2,FGFV's Thoughts,I was very disappointed with this book. I thought it certainly was pricey and I expected much more then full page photographs of people I don't know and don't care to. Also I felt the childrens section was a total waste of space and paper. I am looking foward to some different ideas as I have seen so many of the receipes on her TV show which I do enjoy.
5,Good food doesn't have to take hours,"Ina has a way of simplifying cooking and producing dishes with exceptional flavor. I've tried several recipes and all have been met with rave reviews. I have so enjoyed this book, I bought her other three."
3,"More of a lifestyle than a cookbook, but fun to look through","This book has gorgeous photos and is fun, but it's not really designed for a regular person's life. Garten's idea of parties, which she writes in the introduction, are mostly small gatherings. This means that the book isn't very helpful for larger groups.There are some tips on organizing the party, but not as much I would have liked, such as a timeline of how when to prepare things. Of course, when you are only doing a small party this isn't as important, but even for the tea for 25 she doesn't tell you how you should store things or what you should make first and last.My major complaint would probably be the cost of the recipes. Wow. This book is about how we might like to entertain our closest and dearest friends if we had a vacation house in the Hamptons and a BMW (oh wait...). So, really the book is about an ideal lifestyle most of us just wish we had.It's a fun read and has some interesting recipe ideas, but is not all that practical."
5,Entertaining without the headache,"I love this book. I have used the recipes countless times. Especially the one with shrimp and mango salsa. Roasted pork, endive salad with avocado, pesto, delicious....I so agree with her entertaining philosophy, entertaining friends especially, is about enjoying each other's company better experience when you have delicious food...!"
5,Interesting piece of history,As a resident of Louisiana I found this book to be very informative & enjoyable! My daughter used this as a reference for a history project. (She won first place!) Her project was on 'The History Of Barksdale AFB'. The judges found it impressive that one of her references was written by her Uncle Shawn(my brother)! So our family is proud of him & my daughter greatly appreciated the help he provided her with!
1,Terribly written,"The photos are decent, but the book is terribly written, I'm afraid. Much of the text seems as if it was penned by a fifth-grader. The good people of Barksdale deserve better than this."
5,The true war experience,"Winston Groom captures the essence of the Viet Nam war in this remarkable book. As you travel with these soldiers to Viet Nam and into battle, you feel all the emotions that made this war so controversial. Groom's writing is so vivid that it brings the war right to your doorstep where it can't be ignored or misunderstood. A powerful must-read. Once you start Better Times than These, you won't be able to put it down. And after you've read it, you won't be able to get it out of your mind."
3,Quick Review,"Winston Groom's (the man who wrote ""Forrest Gump"") first book. Set in the Summer of 1966, Billy Kahn is a college student who is enlisted into the Marines for the Vietnam war. The story begins with Billy getting on board a troop transport bound for Asia, following his rise up the ranks to becoming company commander. Just as Billy is reaching the pinnacle of his military career, he is dragged into a moral dilemma that leaves him at a major crossroad.From family and friends protesting their actions at home, girlfriends abandoning them via letter, and the tragic deaths of their fellow soldiers the book does not pull punches with the hopes, passions and tragedies of the realities of soldiers fighting the Vietnam war."
5,The definitive tragicomic novel on the Vietnam War,"Winston Groom's own personal experience as a soldier in Vietnam clearly shows through in ""Better Times Than These,"" and lends the same degree of authenticity captured so vividly by Philip Caputo in ""A Rumor of War."" Groom intruduces his readers to a variety of characters that are all to real and familiar to every Vietnam Vet - from Spudhead Miter, the slow, backward southern farm boy, to the cold and callous, cigar smoking Colonel Patch. ""Better Times Than These"" recounts all the passions of a nation, the personal tragedies of its families, and the brutal realities that are a part of every war. I highly recommend you read this book. And when you're finished, give your friends a wonderful gift by sharing it with them."
2,So-so. Realism a no-go.,"Typical of early novels to come out of Vietnam, Better Times Than These deals more with shallow characters and stereotypes than real people. The author's later stuff is far more substantive."
4,an early and good novel about Vietnam,"I picked up this book in a ""remaindered"" bin, never realizing that it would one day be a valued first edition by the creator of Mr. Gump--no great testimony, in my opinion. For the time, it was certainly the best of the Vietnam novels, though later books have left a deeper impress on me, most especially ""The Things That They Carried."" But you'd do well to have this one on the shelf also. -- Dan Ford"
2,don't bother,"PSU connector is unstable, gets disonnected very easily and that is NOT a good thing when doing data transfer.Also, if you throw away the paperwork (as I did), good luck getting this thing open without it. The only end that has screws is actually *not* the one that opens up, as I found out the hard way. I am still trying to get my HDD out of this thing. AVOID AVOID AVOID, spend your money on another brand!"
1,You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear,"I have never enjoyed the writings of George MacDonald, and even though Lewis tried to select ""the best of"" with his anthology, I did not benefit from reading this book. The fine introduction by Lewis is what prevents this book from receiving a rating of 1. Don't bother buying this unless you want to read what Lewis wrote."
5,Having not read this particular book...,"Maybe it's too easy to take one thing that someone says (anyone says) and not make sense from it once it's out of context. I recommend reading MacDonald in context. His insight is impeachable if you're goal is to know God and be known by God. Otherwise, MacDonald's goal was never to write a theological treatise. Then again, neither was this Jesus' goal when he was here. ""heptazane"" (review above) should beware of being so flippant with things he doesn't fully understand."
3,Gems from George,"Although I have never read George MacDonald before, I figured if he is one of the more influential writers for C.S. Lewis, that I could certainly check out his ""best of"" book.The intro from Lewis is wonderful, and explains his regarding MacDonald as ""his master."" Lewis says that he has never written a book in which he hasn't quoted from MacDonald, and one can see after reading this book how many of Lewis' thoughts may have been shaped by MacDonald.My favorite entry in the anthology is entitled ""The Knowledge of God,"" and reads:To say Thou art God, without knowing what the Thou means -- of what use is it? God is a name only, except we know God."
2,Tragic,"It took me forever to read this novel because it is very, very descriptive and very long. I also found the story very depressing even though it is truly very well written.The story starts in the hills of Kentucky during World War II and Gertie is trying to get her sick child down the mountain to a doctor. She is a strong willed woman who will do anything for her children.The story progresses from the mountains of Kentucky to Detroit, where Gertie's husband take a factory job. Gertie leaves the Kentucky home that she loves due to her mother's nagging and her husband's insistence.From there the story goes down hill and never returns to anything good for Gertie or her family. The story is a treatise on city versus the country and also on industrialization and farming.I can not recommend it since it was so depressing, with one tragedy after another and because it was very tedious reading."
2,Just plain depressing!,"If you want to walk away from a book feeling hopeless and sad, by all means, read this book! You just keep waiting for the book to make a turn around, but the character's life just becomes worse and worse! And the book is so long and terribly detailed! The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I do believe the author accurately portrayed the harshness of life for a family in innercity Detroit during World War II. However, I would not recommend this book to anyone!"
1,waste of time!,"I could care less about this book being depressing as that is the only thing that made the read realistic for a person trying to live in an urban city where things are much more expensive, and work much more fast paced then Gertie's(main character)original country home. The book was far too detailed. For God sakes one does not have to have specific step by step detail on every doll carved, or every pointless digresing thought."
5,heartbreaking/ by donna hunnicutt,"I cannot think when i have read something that has affected me in quite this way. a controlling mother, told to be subservient to her husband, follow him to michigan to work in steel mills during WW11. she loved this old farm, bought it with her own saved money. gave it up, went to the hellhole that was michigan during this time period; practically cardboard houses, too small, filthy, alleyways always dangerous. she lost her daughter to a train, cutting off both her legs. read and understand why wood carving kept this wonderful woman sane. another son left to go back to kentucky and she was thankful i know. well worth the price and its well worth your time to read it."
5,Required Reading,"I read Dollmaker over twenty years ago and have never forgotten its message. I feel all women should be required to read this important story. It shows that the strength, courage and faith that women use daily in everyday life is taken for granted by some but cherished and passed on by others. This book makes you grow in ways that are not easy to describe."
4,Crucial American Literature,"I will not go so far as to say Arnow is another Hawthorne. But what I will say is that this novel deserves a place in the American Museum of Literature for several reasons. First of all, Arnow presents us with dramatic images. Also, she creates an excellent picture of a country family who is forced out of their element. She then shows all the outside perseucution they are subject to. And perhaps this is her biggest accomplishment. Ever since the dawn of the novel, family disputes have been a major theme. This family faces so many problems from the outside, that they DO NOT have the luxury of going through a family dispute. Arnow masterfully shows us the different problems the different characters face and they suffer as a family. At first, I was a bit worried because of the size of this book. But the truth is it is never boring. Not only does this book belong in the museum of Women's Writing, but it also belongs in the museum of American Classics."
5,"Unusual, Gut-wrenching, Great Book","I read Harriet Arnow's book, ""Hunters Horn"" first and knew I wanted to read more of this skillful author's work. I obtained the paperback book, ""The Dollmaker"", and was completely absorbed in it beginning with the very first sentence. When I got to the chapter about the little daughter and the tragic event that happened to her, I literally sobbed. This is a book of human nature - I have never known people like the characters in this book, but I lived every moment with them. I wouldn't recommend the book to just anyone - it takes an individual with a certain sensitivity to appreciate it."
4,The Dollmaker was Excellent,I think this book was excellent. I have seen other comments about how the writer should have turned the characters lives around. But this book was more nonfiction than fiction if you think about it.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read novels with some truth in the words written.
3,Descent of Inanna,"The Descent of InannaIn the Descent of Inanna, there are two sisters, one who is the goddess of heaven and earth and the other who is the goddess of the underground. Inanna is somewhat tricked into visiting her sister in the underworld, but it's more like a trap. The father of both girls sends someone down to save Inanna.In this story I see an aspect of sibling rivalry. The two sisters seem to be trying to out-do each other, like most siblings do. This is still a current thing that happens between siblings.I also feel like the descent could have a double meaning. It's not just her physical journey but also her mental journey into the darkness."
5,"Great shape, Packed well, Arrived timely","Have not read this yet, But the fact it arrived on time, in great shape, and packed nicely; is enough for me for a research material book I intend to use thoroughly."
5,"Inanna, queen of heaven and earth","Excellent book for those who love history,especialy history from the dawn of civilization!If you ever wanted a time machine....here it is!"
3,Inanna Queen of Heaven,Inanna is about the Sumerian goddess of fertility and the grain. This epic is one of sacred love and worship. It celebrates the goddess religion. This epic predates that of the Iliad and the Bible and yet it predicts the great flood and other events in both. If you wish to read a book rich in Sumerian culture this is the epic for you. It gives a sense of what life was like in one of the very first cultures on earth. Reading Inanna by Wolkstein will broaden your horizons and give you an enjoyable read.
1,Dissapointed.,"The color is different from what it looks, it is golden but has some pink in it. I've never used it because of the color."
1,Did not work,"Do not quite understand why, because the write-up states that the battery is appropriate for an AT&T 2419 phone, but neither of the the 2 batteries I purchased work in my phone."
5,Excellent evaluation and explanation of the autopsy report,"Wecht gives an excellent explanation in layman's terms of the autopsy report. His findings were based on the available information, before press. His scenario is most likely the real reason she was accidently killed."
4,read this one first.,"I just finish reading this book, which I found really good. As a non american I think it helps to understand more about what really happend. I'm now reading the one that the parents wrote and then after I will read this one again. Maybe then I will have a clear idea."
2,"Too much opinion,not enough facts.","This book is disappointing.I found there to be too much in the way of the authors opinions and not enough fact to back it up. Everyone has their own opinions on what happenes to poor Jonbenet Ramsey but I was interested in an unbiased account of what went on.I did not feel I got this from this book.I wouldn't recommend this account to those who are interested in facts and evidence,not another personal opinion.I did'nt find this book to be as well written as expected.Look elsewhere for the facts."
3,good read,"Cyril Wecht is a forensic pathologist and known for some extraordinary findings. He is opinionated, direct and straight forward. He makes good sense of autopsy facts yet, he is speculative in his conclusions. Interestingly, Wecht came to his conclusion almost immediately after seeing the first photographs from the Globe and never swayed. My cope was signed by Wecht and behavior is in line with his hand writing. In my upcoming book ""the principle of lying is telling the truth, just not the whole truth"", the JonBenet Ramsey case will be discussed and the elusive S.B.T.C [sic no dot] revealed. And no, my conclusions are not the same as Cyril Wecht's."
4,Too Much Chest-Pounding By Dr. Wecht!,"Overall, I think this is a very good book and I am not questioning Dr. Wecht's qualifications, his work or his conclusions.I think that the book could have been improved by some small editing to minimize the effusive gushing over Dr. Wecht's accomplishments.I don't know if this was done by the co-author or by Dr. Wecht himself, but the laudatory comments read like someone bragging in a high school yearbook. The language used to attempt to glorify Dr. Wecht had the opposite effect on me. I felt it was overdone, childish and unnecessary.However, other than that, I think this is a very sensible, readable book, and I do recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Ramsey case."
2,DISAPPOINTED!!!!,A disappointing book to read...all the information stated in the book was not factual. The information was pulled from tabloids and news articles. ...who reported it first....I think people are buying this book because of Dr Wecht...don't waste your money...We all know who the real killer is! And it isn't mommy and daddy!
2,his conclusions stretch too much too far.,Techncally an outsider who's credentials are mostly in contradicting other's opinions. He also gave unrelated details of the Ramsey's life the sole purpose seemed to be to bias the reader against the Ramseys.
2,JUST ANOTHER THEORY!!,Thought I would find some new information in this book...Disappointed! Nothing that Ialready new! The only real new information is in the book A LITTLE GIRLS DREAM? Read this! You will become flabergasted at the pageant stoies! I now understand why this little girl is so famous...
1,Biased and Unprofessional!,"If you followed the tabloids version of this horrific murder, you DON'T need to read this book. Left unmentioned or unanswered: There was DNA found under her fingernails AND there was DNA found on her clothes THAT DID NOT match anyone in her family!!!!!! I hope the Ramsey's are proved innocent , then like other victims' famiy's have done, change the laws to ""OUTLAW THE MEDIA FROM EVER CONVICTING ANYONE BEFORE A JURY HAS A SAY!"
1,dont waste your money,"this book wasnt up to my expectations so im not even going to waste my time writing much in this review.basically this book is titled""who killed jonbenet ramsey?""but all it really talks about is the autopsy report and the anuthors views on who killed jonbenet and why.basically if youve read the newspaper articles youve read all that this book contains.dont waste your money on this book-its all been said before"
1,BORING!! BORING!!!,Should have went to the super market and picked up a tabloid! At least the tabloids tell you something different each week! This book tells you nothing that the tabloids already haven't told you. I've been told to pick up A LITTLE GIRLS DREAM can't find it????
2,"Boring, Badly written, Tabloid quality.","Simply stated, this book reveals nothing new and the ideas presented aren't even organized coherently. 95% of this book is ""filler."" Save your money."
2,NOTHING NEW!!,I should have saved my money. There was nothing I already knew. The title of the book is exactly what it states.
3,DISAPPOINTED!!,"Thought we were going to be able to find out who murdered Jonbenet! Save your money..... It's nothing but leftovers from newspaper and magazine articles. All you need to know is the last paragraph...the book asks the same question, ""Who Killed Jonbenet Ramsey""?"
1,GIVE ME A BREAK!!! NOTHING NEW!!,Give me a break!! Mr Wecht did not reveal who killed JonBenet Ramsey..All he did was repeat what we had already heard and read!! And he displayed the autopsy report....Pick up the Globe or National Enquirer...they will tell you more than this book did!
2,WHO KILLED JONBENET RAMSEY???????,"That's what we all want to know!! There is nothing new here! Quite disappointed. This book is a waste of time! Read the tabloids, at least they can keep up with the Ramseys!"
2,"Gripping Story, Flawed Logic","This book is well-presented, as a mystery, it's impossible to put down. However, the proposed solution to the crime, purported to be based on forensic evidence (the author's supposed specialty), is illogical, in that ""autoerotic"" acts are by definition not performed by one person upon another! Yet another book with a theory which bends the facts in order to support itself."
1,two months no magazine,"While my credit card was charged right away, I have never received an issue of this magazine. How about a refund?"
1,still waiting,"I ordered this magazine at the end of November and still have not received my first issue. I like this magazine when I buy it from the store so if I ever receive it in the mail, I know it will be a good deal"
1,"Well, where's the magazine?","I ordered this magazine 8/3/09.It is now 9/8/09.I still have not received one issue of this magazine.So I think even one star is inappropriate.by the way,Where's my magazine?"
1,Don't even bother,"Like the 30 other reviewers who have rated these jerks one star, I also took advantage of their Black Friday subscription and I'm still empty handed nearly 3 months later. I don't want to deter anyone from taking advantage of great magazine deals through Amazon--- I was very pleased with my subscriptions to Marie Claire, Glamour, Oprah, and Entertainment Weekly. They were all delivered promptly. I work at a retailer that sells magazines and there have been two People StyleWatches issued since Black Friday. And still.... nothing. At this point, assuming I ever get my subscription, it wouldn't even be a year. All I know is that not only is People dropping the ball, but so is Amazon. They obviously have a lot of unhappy customers on their hands. I was pleased with my other subscriptions, but I will no longer go through Amazon for this stuff because of their inability to handle poor customer service from their vendors."
5,My favorite style mag,"Say what you will about InStyle (which I subscribe to as well), I consider People stylewatch a better alternative if you are trying to choose between the two and don't happen to have a six-figure income. People style watch tries to keep it within my means. They don't just highlight designer brands of clothes, shoes and handbags but also review beauty, hair and fashion products that you can buy at drugstores or target. They have a section on cheap chic - where they copy a designer look on a budget which I enjoy. So for frugal fashionistas, this is a great companion. I wait for mine to arrive every month and am always delighted to find it in the mailbox. Makes my day."
1,I Have Yet to Receive It,I actually love the magazine which is why I ordered but 2 months later......where is it?
2,People Style Watch,"I subscribed to People magazine form Amazon on November 30, 2009 and as of today Febuary 1, 2010 I haven't yet received it. I'm very disapointed with Amazon and People magazine. I would like someone to email me an anwser!"
2,Where are the magazines?,"I ordered this magazine on Cyber Monday after Thanksgiving, and I still have not received and magazines yet. Where are they at? Today is Feb 1st 2010."
1,Never Received,"I recieved the other 2 magazines I signed up for -- but crickets on this one.2 out 3 ain't bad.I don't think so,.Either send the magazine, or refund the money !!!"
1,Has not arrived,"I would love to review it, however I ordered it back in November and it's now the last day in January and it still is not here."
1,Where's my magazine?,"So I ordered this magazine along with Cosmo and Sport's Illustrated on November 29th. It is now Jan 28th and still not one issue. I would love to give this 5 stars since I think it will be a fantastic magazine, but I can't because I don't have it :-/"
2,Did not ask for auto renewal!,"I did not ask for auto renewal when I subscribedto this magazine last Christmas for my daughter.I wrote Amazon telling them they should not presumeI wanted my subscription automatically renewed.I think the magazine is very ""busy."" Lots of goodideas, but the layout is jammed with too many picsand too much info. Despite my objections to the layout,however, I probably would have renewed if I couldhave done it myself."
1,Did not receive yet,The only reason im ranking it so low is that i did not receive a one issue yet...i purchased it in november and february is here and nothing is happening...i dont know how is the communication between the amazon and magazine issuer...please make it right!
1,Trouble in the processing department?,"I was looking forward to reading People magazine, but I have been disappointed so far. I placed the order in November of 2009 and feel that they have had ample time to process my order, because it is now February 2010. I have yet to receive the first copy. It is quite irritating because the company had no problems collecting the debt. Go figure! Still waiting!"
3,Used to be better....,"When this magazine only came out 4 times a year I found it to be very informative, and I always picked it up to see what the next season's trends were going to be. Now that it is produced every month I feel like they have to stretch to fill the pages, and things get repeated."
1,Guys beware!,"I bought this as a gift for my wife because of an amazon price reduction and recommendation.... WOW what a mistake. Its my own fault but I thought this was the real People magazine and not the style version, My wife was very disappointed and I looked like a fool when she opened up the mail box. Apparently this magazine is a huge rip off and now I'm stuck with a years worth of a magazine that I cant even give away! Guys make sure you read the entire description, not just the quick Caps!"
4,<3,I've only recieved one issue but I like the Magazine. I hadn't read it before but for $5 it's worth it
1,disappointed,"Despite numerous e-mails to everyone concerned, I have received no response from anyone as to why this magazine has never showed up. I have yet to receive even one issue and repeated inquiries go unanswered, however, they have my money. It would be nice to be able to write a review, however that is not possible at this time until someone finds my missing magazine."
1,Yet to receive 1st issue,"I ordered 3 magazine subscriptions & have received the 1st issue of one, 2 issues of another but yet to receive the 1st issue of People StyleWatch. 1-star rating is too high for such slow service!"
5,Love this magazine,I've been getting this magazine for a couple of years now and I absolutely love it. I can know what is in style and what isn't and I can rest assured that I will always look as good as possible.
2,great magazine... but I haven't recieved any issue yet!,"I purchased this magazine more than 2 months ago and I haven't recieved any issue, I contact the seller and the answer was: "" there's more demand that we can handle, so expect your issue in february or march"" that's crazy to wait so long to get a magazine! The price is not so good like other deals here in amazon of $5 a year.. but I guess I will have to cancel the order and buy it at the news stand."
1,Empty Mailbox!,"The title of this magazine is now beyond ironic. Each day at the mailbox is literally a People StyleWatch watch! I ordered this on 30 Nov 2009 and it's now 25 Feb 2010. I've gotten zero response in all attempts to reach customer service. It's annoying and I will boycott this publisher (Time, Inc.) in terms of any new subscriptions or renewals.I do give credit to Amazon for making it somewhat easy to try to get in touch with customer service and for giving us a forum in which to make our complaints. Thanks!"
1,Took 3 months for my first issue to arrive,I ordered the magazine subscription black Friday weekend because of the great deal for a years subscription. It was supposed to arrive in about 6-8 weeks. I kept checking back to see the approx date it would arrive and it kept getting pushed back farther and farther. Its now mid February and I just received my first issue (March) 2 days ago. And my 1-year subscription expires in Jan 2011. So apparently a year is only 10 months now. Hmm. Very disappointed with how long it took to get here. Definitely will not be ordering another magazine through Amazon.
1,Still Waiting,"Like other reviewers, I am still waiting to receive my first issue. I purchased this product on 12/01/2009, but I have yet to get my first copy & today is 2/06/10. Amazon, Please help us in getting the product we paid for."
3,just an opinion,"Have read every thing Robert Crais has written, some twice and loved every bit of them. After waiting two years for Forgotten Man I am sorry to say I am dissappointed.Harry Bosch being my all time favorite series and Elvis and Jack Reacher running a close second, but this book leaves a lot to be desired.Carol Starkey was developed nicely and now look what he's done to her. Straighten her out and definately get rid of the pain in the butt Lucy and we will be back on track. I do believe the best of the series is L A Reguiem.I have never written before but I just had to say something this time.irene"
4,Worked as advertised,"Took this with me snorkeling the north shore in Oahu HI. Worked as advertised. It's a little hard to change the camera setting with this on while underwater, but for what it is I would certainly recommend this."
5,waterproof camera case,"Keeps my camera dry and easy to use. I have used it for snorkeling, boat trips, and around the pool. People saw it on a recent vacation to Costa Rica and wanted to know where I got it."
5,"Intelligient, Punishing, Exceptional : this is breach",It's Me God by breach is one of the best indie/doom metal albums ever. The album has moments of pure punishing riffage and drum work while relieving this with moments of sheer meloncholy. The band uses a great deal of layers and utilizes other instruments such as the tamborine and drum circles which adds to the overall effectiveness. The vocals are exceptionally well done and from the heart err...throat I suppose. This band has a great deal of talent and it shows...if you are a metal/metalcore/hardcore/indie fan...you owe it to yourself to check out this album!
1,Breach.,"I was looking for Breach from Flemington, NJ. Man those guys could rock. Especially the lead singer."
5,The most wonderful captivating book ever! Rest in Peace Judy,"I was just devistated to know that Judy went through this terrible disease not only as written in this book, but again. She lost her life to cancer. This book is not only uplifting spiritually, Judy wrote this book so well, you felt you were by her side through the whole ordeal.This book was dedicated to her husband Pierre Asti who I have the wonderful pleasure of knowing and after reading it, you will know why Judy wrote ""God's man every step of the journey."""
3,not recommended,"I love her other books, but this one is contains too much sex and is not very interesting. I would recommend one of her others."
5,Wonnderful reading,"THis author captures the essence of British Society to a ""T"". Most interesting reading for her American friends. Hard to put them down."
3,Mixed feelings,"I liked the Lytton trilogy, but this book caused mixed feelings: it is unrealistic -- all these perfect looking women, and sex scenes are just childish -- the author likes to show off her knowledge about sex terminology and love making. The storyline is great, but author is overdoing a lot."
4,A fascinating story by a nuclear pioneer,"Robert Serber was J. Robert Oppenheimer's student, friend, and first recruit for the atomic bomb laboratory at Los Alamos. Serber recounts this, as well as the most of the rest of his life, in an engaging informal style. I wish he'd been a little more forthcoming about his and Oppenheimer's politics, but even the little bit he tells adds vital new information to these subjects. He also recaptures how the A-bomb project looked to people who were AT WAR, who actually had to choose between killing the enemy and letting their countrymen be killed. Highly Recommended."
2,not worth the money,first time i ordered the item i was pleasantly surprised each chocolate was filled nicely with burbon and had a strong burbon taste. second time i ordered the item there was very little if any burbon in the chocolate. attempted to contact the seller and had no response. don't waste your money on this expensive item
4,"Intelligent satire, but lacked the last step to greatness for me.","Intelligent, droll, well made study of one man remaking himself as a hero under the cover of war.Poses interesting questions about identity and truth, and how we all invent ourselves.Some terrific cinematography, and a solid lead performance by Mathieu Kassovitz.However, something was missing for me emotionally. Sometimes the ideas seemed heavy handed,and other times, motives and characters underdeveloped.However, enough smart critics and viewers I admire saw this as a near masterpiece, that I'd be open to taking another look."
3,Is this really digital?,"I love the movie. Too bad this DVD version is so bad. The disk contains nothing but the movie itself (not even subtitles), and even the movie itself is in a very poor condition. I find that peculiar as I think the movie deserves a lot more. You should be able to download subtitles from the web."
5,Amazing and intelligent film!!!,"I love french films, but when I saw Un hero tres discret I was speechless :) in this movie Mathieu Kassovitz plays a salesman who wants to be a hero (with the less effort possible) so he leaves everything and goes to Paris.There, he mets really interesting people and begins to create his own heroic story. The things he does (in a really charming way) makes you want him to success.Of course there are holes in his history and some suspect of him, but he has to accept that he doesn't belong to that life 'cause he has to make really hard decisions. And he suffers for that.I highly recommend this film, it's a great price and you won't regret it :)"
2,Good price...but short on interpretation,"This collection is a good bargain for people who want to be introduced to the romantic classical music. The 10 CD really contain a great deal of music. However, the playing falls short. The playing was dry and boring, with little hint of emotion involved in the performance. To be honest, even most of the bargain CDs I find in K-mart have much better playing than this. I never fast forwarded or skipped as many tracks on a classical CD as I did on this one. If you just want to hear a large selection of pieces regardless of the playing, then get this. But if interpretation and playing matters for you, there are better bets else where. The ""Millenium Top 40"" is also a collection, but the pieces there are actually beautifully played. Naxos' Romantic Pieces for Piano Collection are also a good deal."
3,A lot of music,This grouping of music is OK but it doesn't grab me and make me want to play it over and over like most of my other CDs. There's something about the accoustics or the audio of the CDs that doesn't blend with my other CDs. The sound is recorded too quiet or low to be played with other CDs unless I'm able to adjust the volume for each different CD. I'm not real thrilled with this purchase but I do listen to this group of CDs at times.
2,"Sorry, dude, but there's only one Barry White","I'm usually open to trying out anything where Maurice Starr is involved (he wrote all the songs on this album), because he's been a force behind a lot of the music that I grew up with. Despite his rich legacy, this is one album that's pretty well deserving of its obscurity. Starr tries his best as always with the songwriting, and some credit must be given to Rick Wes's backing crew for creating some lush, nicely textured backgrounds here (including saxophone work by Gerald Albright and backing vocals by Margo Thunder of the 80s girl group 9.9). However, whoever actually let RW himself take the mike should be spanked. He speaks too much (and in an annoying monotone fashion at that), he's not much better at singing, and his deliberate Barry White knock-off would probably have White turning over in his grave.Not grossly disgusting, but not recommended for anyone other than hardcore Maurice Starr fans."
3,Kinda Junky,"Suntune gauges are not what they used to be. I had problems with the oil pressure gauge in this set. It would stick at about 20 psi both directions. When you started the engine, it would stick, and you had to tap on it to get it going past 20 psi. Then when you shut the engine off, it would stick on 20 psi on the way down. I was set to return it, got a RMA and everything, but it was a hassle to remove it, after I spent a couple hours putting it in. Then the thing got broke in after a couple of weeks, and the sticking problem occurred less often. Now it does not happen at all anymore. The light bulbs that come with it (for dash lights) are very dim, I would say yellow. I probably would not buy these again, but they are working now, and I do like the black face and hot orange needles."
5,Fun and Engaging Reading,"It's pretty hard to go wrong with a novel by Josi Kilpack and this one does not disappoint. If you're looking for something completely enjoyable to relax with, To Have or To Hold is a great choice. The characters are likable and believable, even if the circumstance here definitely isn't one that would happen everyday!Have some fun and read this book!Victoria Gunther[...]"
5,To Have or to Hold,I really like the author's style and I have read 3 other books by her. She keeps your interest right from the start and that is what makes a good book.
2,"Engaging writing, misrepresentation of the Goddess","This is my first reading of Nalo Hopkinson's writing. Although, I find the book engaging to some degree, I get really turned off by the misrepresentation of the Goddesses Ezili and Het-Hru (mistakenly called Hathor--the wellknown Greek name for the Goddess). If you're writing from the perspective of the people who originally worshipped the goddess, at least get her name culturally correct. It would lend more authenticity to the storytelling. The limitations given to Ezili in the story are painful to read (a goddess trapped inside a human?? A goddess being birthed in the 1800s??). Sorry doesn't sit right or fly right with me. The modern vulgar language used by the goddesses are insulting and disturbing. I was excited to read this book. I was dissappointed. Nalo is a talented writer. I give the writing 4 stars, however, because of the way the goddesses and African descended women are presented in the story, 2 star rating overall."
5,Lots of Great Music... Cheap!,"This is a ten CD box set with a huge number of great classical piano pieces. Most are played by Jeno Jando, who gets high marks from the Penguin Guide to Compact Discs and DVDs (highly recommended in its own right for the novice and experienced classical music CD buyer) for his playing on budget labels. You will recognize many of the pieces and they will serve as a jumping off point for additional exploration of classical piano. At roughly $2 each, you can't lose!"
1,Very unimpressed,"The weight change is nice but as you hold the mouse and put pressure on the top, the weight releases up into your hand. The physical size of the mouse is too small, it does not feel comfortable. The cable is very stiff and lies in loops across the desk. After several ejections of the weight, many small pieces of plastic were broken off and were discarded. I expect that to be called a gamer's mouse all these deficiencies need to be corrected. Very annoying - I returned what was left of the mouse and received my money back and all this trouble was in two weeks time, save your money and get a logitech mouse."
1,Not impressive at all,"I didn't find the shape of this mouse particularly ergonomic. maybe it would be better for gaming, but i doubt the angular shape had any intent other than to look cool. right out of the box, there was a little rattle inside and i unscrewed things to find a little plastic nubbin broken off. the main problem is that after a few weeks, it developed a problem where it will double click on a single-click-- not every time but frequently enough to be really annoying."
2,Work well at last 1mounth,"Man I'm very disapoit about this mouse, I'm a gamer and after 1 mounth of using the left button star to fail and as you know on a game or web brouse this become a disaster, creative should make a better product like their sound cards.I gonna by a Logitech, they had a better experince on mouse area"
2,Good concept- poor build quality. Avoid like the plague.,"I bought this mouse for gaming a couple months ago and have really enjoyed it's features, particularly the on-the-fly resolution adjustment. I don't think the third button has a real use, however. The real problem lies in the fact that the left mouse button has become nearly useless. Every other click now either goes unregistered or double-clicks. This is apparently a very common issue, as I have discovered a lot of online forums concerned with this issue. I've gone back to my Dell optical, and will probably never buy a Creative mouse again."
1,Do not buy this mouse,"I have had this mouse for exactly 5 weeks. On the 35th day (5 days earlier I could have gotten a refund) this mouse broke.Reading other people's review of this mouse, I can see that I am not the only one.DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE."
3,Not the best... just ok,"I bought this mouse for my dad for playing counter-strike. He seems to like it, but he had a laptop mini mouse... so anything is an improvement. I have a Razer Deathadder, and the 1010 mouse just doesnt compare. The mouse is comfy, but doesnt track as well. Anoter problem I ran into was the 3rd and 4th buttons dont work in the game... Maybe its just me, but its pretty lame to have extra buttons that dont work. If ur not cheap, go for a Razer instead... ~Viperbird~"
1,Does Not Last,"I loved this mouse for a good 6 months - then the left clicker began to fail. After a month of slowly failing, it died all together. As others have said before me - this mouse is great for a while but not a smart purchase."
1,left clicking is terrible after 2 months,"I bought two of these mice for about $10 (together), 2 months ago. It was great for a while but about a week ago started mistaking my single clicks as double clicks. By now, BOTH of them are COMPLETE DISASTERS. They both mistake double clicks for single clicks, and I CANNOT GAME AT ALL! By now, it's a disaster. ""The man himself at QuakeCon. Jonathan ""Fatal1ty"" Wendel is the brains behind the Creative Fatal1ty 1010."" Next time (very soon), I'm going to buy a mouse designed by an engineer, not a gamer. Learned my lesson :-("
2,Worked great for a while,"Worked great for a while (couple months), but then the left button stopped responding to each click. That happening to a game mouse really hinders your survivability. It takes an average of 3 clicks before the mouse responds in-game, no matter how the settings are."
3,Just ok...it is a mouse...,"There are 5 buttons so for hard-core gamers, this mouse may answer your needs...however the mouse physically is I think too small to fit in your hands comfortably. After a few hours of gaming, my hand gets a little stiff. The cable is also shorter than I'd like - but for the price can't complain!"
2,Not as good as I would have hoped.,"I have a Logitech G5 and just received the 1010. Here are my first impressions:It slides nice and I like the larger mouse feel. I think the 3rd finger button would come in handy once I got used to it.It feels cheap. The weight rattles as the mouse moves and the button clicks are LOUD.I prefer the speed adjustment of the G5 rather than the 1010. The 1010's is just one button that you use to rotate through the speeds rather than, as on the G5, up/down buttons.The thumb button is oddly placed and kind of hard to push.I really do like the feel of it in my hand, and it slides really smooth. It beats the G5 in this area. Also, I have an ICEMAT mouse pad, the the laser G5 will not work on it."
4,Nice and Unique gift,"If you have struggled like I have trying to figure out what to give your significant other after several Valentine's Days, this is the perfect solution! Problem is, you can really only give it once. Unless you are going for a full dozen..hmmm."
2,Meh...,"title says it all...!nothing extraordinary about these roses.Stiff like a rock, brittle like a stale cookie, stinky like nail polishthere is no real way to keep them in a bundle to give as a bouquet.I kinda regret this buy, cuz i bought the dozen!"
5,Great Coffeee Maker,If you want a coffee maker that is built like a tank the KitchenAid Pro coffeemaker is a great choice. I have owned the coffee maker for 7 months and am very pleased with it.It brews a great cup of coffee.Despite what some have said the coffee maker is extremely well made and built like a commerical unit--it weighs over 20 pounds.The manual is well written and the machine is easy to program.It is very quiet and typically takes 6 to 8 minutes to brew depending on how fine you grind your coffee.1)If you do buy this machine do get the gold basket filter--the coffeedoes taste better with it.2) Also consider buying the water filter.My only complaint is that the warming plate that the carafe sits on keeps the coffee too hot and it will become rancid if it kept on too long.If you can afford it this is a great machine to have.
4,"Worth it, but...........","I love this coffee maker. Coffee stays really hot and it is the way it's supposed to taste. I only have two problems...and don't know if anyone else has this....the ""on"" button sticks and I have to manually return it to upright position and , when pouring, the spout leaks all over. I can overlook those two things for the way the coffee tastes (the most important thing)...however....it can be annoying."
1,Carafe leaks - Buy a Bunn,"The carafe leaks when you pour coffee into your cup, as well as pouring water into the machine - to make the coffee. Poor carafe design. I spent over $300.00 for this machine! It is sad that engineers could overlook such and important component! The spout on the carafe, regardless of how the carafe is placed, leaks water when pouring. I am going back to my Bunn, which is a superior product in my opinion."
4,Something for everyone,"Indeed, this book has something for everyone. No matter what your age or outlook, this delightful book is a favorite. From the vivid drawings to the hilarious text, it's perfect. Parents won't get tired of reading this one over and over because you laugh at something everytime. My three children are in their twenties and still insist that I put this book out each Christmas. I think all children can relate to ""burned blueberry binkies"" and if Santa will get their letter on time. Unless you're a Scrooge, you'll love this book!"
5,Loved it!,"This book is chock full of the cutest pictures, and has a great tale of the pig family's adventures in getting ready for christmas!"
4,it gets better!,"The last page, for me, was a nice change. The story gets stronger as the book progresses and I found it difficult to put the book down. Brian has an eye for detail and it shows! I highly recommend reading The last page!"
3,"Tough circumstances, tougher characters","In ""The Last Page,"" Palmer combats the toughest of circumstances, with even tougher characters. His characters must deal with love, death and the life that remains. Palmer's most significant strength in his debut novel, to me, is his strong grasp of place and attention to detail. He specifically does a good job of setting his scenes in Tacoma favorites.Economy: Palmer's novel, however, is quite wordy and underpunctuated, which makes for fairly slow reading, including a need for quite a bit of re-reading.Also I thought there was a number of points in the novel when action was summarized rather than actually developed, which cheats the characters and the story.""The Last Page,"" however, is peppered with gems, as Palmer's characters not only grapple with the meaning of love, but with themselves."
1,dominique,"i am still waiting for this item so far its been 1 month, so i cannot rate this item, ups is making a trace...so thats it"
2,Definitely not college level,"I bought this textbook because it was required for a class I took. I've since dropped the class and returned the book, good riddance. Maybe the expected level of education has plummeted since I finished school 3 years ago, but this was an early high school level book AT BEST. Yes, the pictures are colourful and pretty, but they were also gigantic, taking up entire half-pages in some places. That's called padding. The type size was enormous (more padding) and most of the textbook was just a not-that-brief summary of the bible text - you might as well just read the bible itself.This book is for COMPLETE BEGINNERS who have never picked up the bible and probably never plan on doing so in the future after reading this book. (But then why even buy this book in the first place?) What you're paying for when you buy this book is pretty pictures and the heavy, glossy paper, not quality information. For that, try another book."
3,Good info,Book in great condition. I like the easy way the old testament is divided and explained as a whole. Pictures good.Older publicatiion so some commentaries I think would be different in view of the current world events.
4,Great Design; Poor Reliability,"""Over the years we have purchased a great many Insteon products from Smarthome. I have to say that the Insteon design concept is really great -- our entire home runs on it -- but the failure rate is really very difficult to live with; devices cease working very frequently -- for example, this is the third 2430 we have purchased -- and, as if that wasn't bad enough, Smarthome refuses to stand behind these products... They simply will not exchange them. We are already commited to the Insteon array of products (eg. see order below) but, frankly, I wish that there was an alternative to Smarthome. """
3,Insteon glimmer,"I recently purchased the Insteon lighting starter kit. I was impressed with the ease of setup and functionality. The controller worked well with the supplied lamp modules and my legacy X10 network. However, the controller does not allow for discret control of more than 5 modules. Most of of us who have used X10 for sometime enjoy discret control of a minimum of 16 modules. Insteon allows for scene control of multiple modules, but discret control of only 5 units. I am sure there will be additional controllers in the future to allow for more flexible control, but I feel it was shortsighted to release the product without this type of controller already available. I am ready to return the system based upon it's limited range at present."
3,Need Other Items Also!!,"Be careful!.. Although really nice and cool,.. do some research, because you will need other parts that are needed to synchronize this product with your lights, appliances, etc."
5,The most complete reference for Biblical Hebrew syntax,"This is the best reference work for Biblical Hebrew (BH) syntax. There are other syntax references for BH, but none this thorough by a long shot. They all have their place and fulfill their own function, but in terms of a definite reference guide, this is the one. It's a pretty hefty volume and will certainly keep the reader busy for some time.... Beginners might want to check out Arnold/Choi's or Williams's work, which are essentially abbreviated or simplified versions of this one."
5,Standard Grammar for the Biblical Hebrew Syntax,This Grammar offers a new non traditional view on the problems of the Biblical Hebrew syntax. It is indispensable for those who want to understand the Hebrew biblical text on the professional level.
2,Use Caution when relying on this work,"This work is an interesting volume. Useful for understanding that there is syntax in the Hebrew language, but not exactly for understanding how that syntax functions. Waltke O'Connor's categories are often misleading, and their examples don't always show what they want them to show."
5,great acting,"Worth multiple viewings as these two stars are at their best, besides who doesn't like redemption when you can get it?"
3,Well done but painful,This is a masterpiece no doubt. The acting is fantastic. The story intelligent. The setting amazing. I'm only giving it 3 stars because if I was asked by a close friend if s/he should watch this I would say no - because it's too painful. There's enough pain in the world already.
4,Excellent film mais adaptation incomplète du roman,"Sans aucun doute, c'est l'un des meillers films de son temps. Mais il m'a toujours laissé un got d'inachevé. Car si le roman est un chef-d'oeuvre, le film lui, se contente souvent de quelques clichés et de longues minutes de silence qui ajoutent rarement de l'intensité au film. À quand la suite du film (Banco)?"
5,Truley breathtaking...,"Gotta watch it!!ITs a movie that will amke you laugh, cry, make you sad and or happy.It will take you through all emotional levels.Old FLick but quality history.Based on the true events of a French Prisoner.Dustin hoffman was Brilliant!!and Steve McQueen!!Good one"
5,Absolutely Incredible!!,"This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Dustin Hoffman's Best, in my opinion. An absolute classic, which should be part of any collection."
5,Papillon,I think it is the best movie that Steve McQueen made. Explained the prison system in French Guinea. Great movie.
4,A DVD review,"An extremely well done video transfer to DVD, especially for a movie of this age. Some newer movie transfers to DVD have a lot of scratches and blotches. Some interesting documentaries featuring the person the movie was based on. Probably the best value on DVD around."
4,"Josh,s comments of Papillon movie.","This film is well made,great location scenery,though somewhat disturbing also,Steve Mcqueen who plays Papillon, goes through tremedous hell,making things worse is the fact, that Papillon is really innocent,he must endure starvation,islolation,and maybe even worse..the fact he realizes through halluicnation dream that his life was wasted,this is a point in the movie that makes a person take notice,don,t waste your life,however the character is not totally a (waste) as Mcqueen,s character demonstrates his resilents,peresistence, and human spirit,despite the odds,that brings him and co-star Dustin Hoffman to somewhat epic ending."
3,FINE PERFORMANCES IN AN AVERAGE FILM!,"Franklin J. Schaffner's ""Papillon"" is one of those movies that you will only see once. Despite the film's epic scope, it is overly long and slow. Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffmann do give great performances, but the characters are pretty much there as an afterthought, swallowed in the bowels of this slow art film. There are definitely moments in the film that could've been removed, and the main story wouldn't suffer.Recommended only for Hoffman and McQueen fans. As for others, I recommend another film from Franklin J. Schaffner: ""Patton.""Movie/DVD Grade: C+"
1,ZzZzZzZ...,"after wasting 3 or so hours watching this film i feel as if it is the single dumbest film ever made, Now don't get me wrong the acting of Steve McQueen and Mr. Dustin Hoffman were simply amazing but just the story of the show was so boring and i do understand it is a true story but leave it at that, god bless butterfly boy and good for him for making it to freedom but no need to make such a boring story into a movie or even a book."
5,fluttering towards an oscar - surely,"I've seen Papillon three or four times now, and every time I watch it, it improves. Surely this is Steve's best acting performance. The second scene in the prison cell is surely one that has been mimicked time and time again in films over the years. Such an impression the film had on me that I have backed a racehorse four times with the name Papillon in the last few years. Readers in the UK will know that Papillon won the grand national this year, no one knows how Steve never won the oscar for his performance."
5,One of the best movies ever!,"I saw the movie for the first time when I was about 12 yrs old and loved it! Now at 34 yrs old I 've probably seen this movie now about 40 times and each time is as good as the first!Since then about 2 years ago I was finally able to get a copy of the book ""Papillon"" by Henri Charriere (Papillon) in English and found this book to be also one of the best books I've ever read! Yes the movie has it's differences and to be exactly like the book it would of been another hour longer(which I would of had no problem with). If you like movies about history, people overcoming great odds,human bonding and even adventure this movie has it all.This movie is not only a MUST see it is a MUST own!!!"
3,Long...,"While the movie was well-made, it was long, and I was surprised at the content for a movie rated PG. Not family friendly as it contains nudity and sexual situations."
4,Well functioning for price,"I purchased this product to use as my office phone with Skype while I work at home with my baby. I was worried that such a cheap phone would not work well, especially with a wireless connection. But I have had absolutely no problems. There is a relatively lengthly cord attached to the phone, & it's more comfortable to hold then my cell phone. Nice display. The only complaints I have with it is the Skype interface/settings, but that isn't the phones fault. I do wish some of the phone settings themselves were easier to discern by the graphics. I'll have to look at the manual to figure them out. All in all a good phone, especially for the price."
3,works purty good,"so far i haven't had any problems with this phone. the software surprisingly integrated easily. the phone is lighter than i had expected, and i'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. all functions are clear and user friendly. the only problem i have is that the little rubber thingy on the side of the phone that's supposed to cover an input for headphones is really flimsy and kinda annoying, so i just cut it off. i got it for 22 bucks, and certainly can't complain. i wanted to experiment with a peripheral for using skype, before investing in more expensive hardware, and am pleased."
4,Great guide for the basics of any martial art.,"Sifu Burt Richardson breaks down the concepts of Jeet Kune Do so that martial artists of all disciplines can better understand the holistic approach to the study of martial arts. Burton starts with philosophy and tactics, then gives a detailed explanation of the five categories. He concludes by illustrating how these concepts can be applied through hundreds of photos. This book in not about a particular system, but how the individual martial artist can practice more efficiently and with greater understanding than ever before."
3,Shows some good techniques,"This is a fair-good book that shows some good techniques for a variety of attacks. However it should outline sections on takedowns, blocks/parries, and finishes. If you know little about defense then I suggest that you get another book/video first."
1,Weak,Not the best work on JKD. Padded with pictures this book does convey the essence of JKD Concepts but I was looking for more of a techniques oriented text. Try Entering to Trapping to Grappling by Hartsell if you're like me and want to see some techniques you can add to your repetoire.
4,Confused,In my opinion no one can express what jeet kune do is really about except the master Bruce Lee himself since he never really got into the hardcore aspects of it before his tragic death. All these people who think they know Jeet Kune Do have no idea that what they do know could be no more then the 2nd class of it. The real tragic part is no one alive knows the full art of Jeet Kune Do since his son passed away. He hadnt taught anyone long enough for anyone alive to know all of Jeet Kune Do.
1,Don't waste your time,"This downloadable book is only 10 pages when you get rid of all of the advertising for the other books from the same company.There are a couple of 'nuggets' of information in there but they are general in nature.""Keep your eye on the business value. The CTO's fundamentalrole is reducing the risk and ensuring that the investment intechnology produces the appropriate business benefits.

4,A FUN READ,"This mystery was a fun read. It felt like I was actually inside the ""action"". Characters were well-defined and interesting."
5,BEST BOOK EVER,"This was the best book ever, funny with a lot of adventures and action a must read. don't forget to read book 2 coyote season"
1,"Unreliable, stops working for no reason...but it's a pretty color.","I'm posting another bad review for this Ortho sprayer, in the hopes that Ortho may someday get the message and fix their product. Basically, after a few uses, the integrity of the vacuum mechanism breaks down for no particular reason, water comes gushing from the plastic trigger housing, and no more of the chemical mixes with the water. ...so you end up spraying plain water for twenty minutes before you realize it. I'm going to check the Gilmour sprayer, it looks to have eight stars here on Amazon."
1,Don't buy it,"I suggest you don't buy this piece of junk. I followed the instructions trying to apply an Ortho weed killer, which suggested the use of this sprayer. The liquid level never changed during the whole time I sprayed (about 3,000 ft2), so basically I waste my time.The sprayer was new and I checked that the nozzle was not plugged, so no excuse for Ortho."
1,Accuracy a Big Question,"This is a great sprayer in concept, just one unit to accurately deliver many products that have different mix rates. I am not convinced the dial system is very accurate.I have 12,500sf of lawn to spray. It should take 2 1/2 bottles of Weed-B-Gone. Instead, it takes 8 bottles! I just bought a new one and Weed-B-Gone runs through it at the same rate--about three times faster than it should."
1,"Horrible product, stay away - you have been warned!","I bought this product as it was one of the cheapest sprayers and the saying ""You get what you pay for"" applies totally to this product. The product worked for a few days. I don't even think it was mixing the proportions right when it was working, the Ortho insecticide concentrate that went into it ended in a few minutes - it was supposed to make 16 gallons and last a while, however I am sure it ended in like 5 mins or so of spraying. Not only did I waste my money on this spray product, my whole insecticide was also wasted. Stay away from this horribly engineered product."
1,Didn't work at all,Bought one of these at Ace Hardware. Hooked it up to the hose and it worked for about 20 seconds before water started gushing out a hole in the back of the sprayer attachment. Wasn't able to tighten the hose any further or stop the leak. Ended up returning it.
1,another disatisfied customer,"The first year I used it it worked fine. I left insecticidal soap/water mix in it over the winter. So I guess I have no right to complain, but I just wasted an hour spraying before I noticed that the level of the mixture had not gone down in the reservoir."
1,Good for one use only,"I bought one at Lowes. I used it once and it seemed to work ok, then I rinsed it well, then later that day tried to use it again, and a bunch of water leaked out of the device. I took it back to Lowes and got a replacement. I used this one once, and then when I filled it with water to rinse it out, it leaked exactly like the other one did. We have been using these things for years and they used to be great, but now they do seem to be junk."
3,I'm glad I had hose washers sitting around...,"I bought this sprayer at one of those home improvement warehouse stores near my home. I wanted to save some money by buying concentrate for all of the random weed control, fertilizer, pesticide, etc that I use. The cheap plastic construction didn't really bother me at first because everything is cheap and plastic these days.The first thing I noticed was that when I connected the hose and turned it on, it sprayed out the back of the sprayer more than out of the front. Luckily I bought some hose washers a few weeks before and used one of the round ones that goes on the male end of the hose and it stopped the leaking for the most part. It still does leak back when I turn the hose off and relieve the pressure for some reason, but that doesn't bother me too much.The application was simple and the one bottle of concentrate saves me alot of money over buying the individual ready to use bottles so I'm still giving it 3 stars."
1,Same problem,"Unit leaks below the trigger, bought another one and had the same problem, Ortho must be run by bean counters to sell such junk. Gave it One star because I can't give Zero."
1,JUNK,"Unlike some one-star reviewers (and yeah, why doesn't Amazon offer the option of NO star?), I didn't even get one full use out of my brand-new sprayer. It gave two weak spritzes - one could hardly call spraying what it did - then leaked water out of the handle near the hose end and expired. The only liquid emanating from it was the leak.Seriously, if Ortho had a business conscience (OK, OK, I know it's an oxymoron), they'd reimburse all purchasers for this piece of crap. Their reputation just fell off a cliff in my estimation!"
1,Waste of Time,I agree with Robert Horton's review under the amazon.com Editorial Review section. Save your money and find another film to sit through.
1,StoOpiD,This movie was just completely ridiculous and stupid. There were two good things in it. One was the performance of Alan Rickman and the other was seeing Duschkue (sp?) in various stages of undress. It was full of plot holes and things that just didn't make sense. One example a guy that can put an entire car together in an hour. And then the reason he did was totally stupid as when the remote control car was driven thru the wall he could have simply took the bag out of the hatch and drove the same car out of the store. There was no reason to have the second car or to have to put it together like they did.This movie was just dumb.
4,A Cute Little Book,"Give Me Grace is billed as a way for your child to grown in their faith. We received this little book a few years ago from our friends when we adopted our first child, Grace. Each page is painted in acrylics with striking colors and is done so much like a lower elementary student. This gives it a warm feeling that matches the simple rhymed verses extremely well. Each day is represented by different kinds of flowers, and the pictures depict children doing a variety of activities. The pages with the children always show them with animals doing an assortment of peaceful activities. The last page ends with, ""In the wonder of each day, let me live a holy way."" I always remind my girls that this can only be done in Christ."
5,Pleasing Prayers for Children,"The charming prayers, one for each day of the week, are a good way to help children develop gratitude. They express simple sweet thoughts of thankfulness to our creator, and the illustrations go with the prayers nicely. The choice of words and phrases add to the appeal."
1,The unquiet are nauseated readers,"This garbage was supposed to be science fiction. If your knowledge of genetics lets you believe a ""mutation"" could cause human offspring to become a superstrong vampire, with no defects, in one generation, this may be the book for you -- I couldn't hack it. The setting was like a jungle filled with tigers -- no other animals. Serious SF does not have battlefleets without civilizations and industry supporting them -- economics have to be considered. If the characters have no constraints as to where they go or what they do, it's a fantasy, not science fiction."
4,"A real step forward, but downside is handle opens very wide","These pliers work very well and adjust automatically (awesome!), but the downside is the handle must open very wide compared to my old Craftsman usa-made visegrip. The width plus rather slippery handles make me usually have to use two hands to span the distance (I have average-sized man hands). The 7inch needle nose pliers from the same company seem to be better in this regard as they are smaller.I might add some grip-tape to the lower handle so one or two fingers could find a purchase and start closing it."
3,"Works, however......","While the self adjusting feature works fine, the handles open up so wide that you have to use two hands to close them. You might has well use regular vise grips that require only one hand."
2,RIP OFF! Buy the Wal-Mart version for $10 less.,"I give it 2 stars because they do protect your eyes, but as for the rest; they have the same cheap sticker on the lens as they have on their cheap tape measure. But do they look cool you ask? No. They remind me of the type the Dentist gives me so he doesn't drop his scraper in my eyeball. Buy something cheaper from Wal-Mart, Lowes, or Home Depot. Better way to spend your money and it will save you $10."
1,Tax Evasion for Dummies,Here's good reading while you are doing 10-15 years for tax evasion. Get an accountant and forget about trying to outsmart the IRS. There is nothing the IRS doesn't want you to know. The problem is it is way more than you will ever know. Tax codes are the number one killer of trees.
1,Part of the Problem,"The author wants us all to be Type A Taxpayers by always following the advice of a professional (such as himself) -- rather than being Type C (self sufficient, argumentative, etc.)Even if this book represents the best advice -- it still falls in the category of another boring tax guide. It succeeds only as further proof that the tax code is intentionally confusing and unfair -- designed to serve not only the government, but the tax industry of arrogant CPAs and attorneys"
4,Good Value,"This is a great set for a small space. It was delivered promptly and easy to assemble. The only problem I actually had with this was the loose bolts inside the box, I lost one of the bolts because it fell out of the box. Be careful when opening after delivery. Everything lined up well and the item looks exactly like the picture, very pleasing. Would definitely recommend."
2,Doesn't work that well...,I use a lot of garlic for cooking and I've been wanting a peeler. I was disappointed that this peeler did not really get the peel off. Save a couple bucks- just pop your garlic cloves in the microwave for 10 seconds. Peel comes off easy!
1,Beware -- does not work with GigE!,"As of this writing, there was no mention in the description for this device that it does not support Gigabit Ethernet. If you want to use on GigE (as well as 10/100), then you want the 3001G model, NOT this one!"
3,Could have been better,"A HALF DECENT BOOK ABOUT AN SS SOLDIERS COMBAT, PRE AND POST WAR EXPERIENCE.The book starts off very slow and boring about the authors home life pre military days but once you get through that his combat experiences are actually good and interesting, for these reason three stars tops"
4,Yeah It's Good,"Good book, parts of the book are enthralling and vivid. Overall not up to 5 stars, however."
2,"A naive ""I didn't know anything"" German private story","The author tells a rather disappointing story abouth when he was a humble and simplistic soldier, proud of the ""good branch of SS"", despite hiding it during captivity for obvious reasons and ignoring his father's advice not to join the SS for the ""things they are doing here"". Another German soldier that ""didn't know anything""... Impressive is that the author insisted that war was ""Europe fighting against bolshevism"", ignoring all the nations invaded by Germany and validating that thought with the fact that non-Germans from invaded countries were joining SS for obscure reasons..."
4,Seeing the Waffen-SS ambiguously!,"Totally different book from my normal genre and thats what really worked for me. It's not a fast paced page turner but it kept you in the stadium. The biggest difference is that it gives you a totally different outlook of the ""Waffen-SS"". I'm used to reading it from the enemies point of view. As I seen, these warriors, no different than me (USMC), were dedicated to their country. They were disciplined, dedicated, loyal soldiers. A different warrior than the brutal SS, killing innocents and the like. These men frowned at the idealisms of most of the SS and showed an opposite side to their counterpart. I'm glad I read this book to see this side of the Waffen-SS and I'm thankful the author wrote this memoir for all to see."
3,It's okay ...,"""When a 20-year old Waffen-SS veteran of eighteen months of combat against the Soviets and Americans is confronted with the awful, undeniable truth of the Holocaust, ..."" blahblahblah - I don't like ""political correct"" books/media.The truth is not political correct!"
3,Pleasant Surprise,"Nice little story written by a surprisingly good writer and former soldier of an SS Mountain Regiment. He takes the reader from his indoctrinated youth to an area very often ignored in WWII battle histories; Karelia. Written while a PW and recounted in the years during so, it is a nice look into the viewpoint of someone who gave all of his heart for his fellow soldiers and the ""anti-Bolshevist"" cause, only to be confronted with the horrors done by many SS troops in other theaters of war. The price really isn't justified as the book is just over 200 pages and the maps look very amateurish: probably kicked out on a standard PC."
3,brand new book is defective,"I have receive this book in brand new condition. However, some pages were missing - misprinted and blank ! What a shock ! even thought I got a full refund for this book, I still am unable to read those missing pages.. and it was 8 pages that was misprint, not just one, Sigh !"
5,Youthful Idealism Betrayed,Every country and every generation there is always that group of idealist young people who go charging forward to Save the World and to promote 'Socical Justice' and in the end learn the hard way the awful abomination they have actually served while leaving a path of destruction in their wake.The author served in the SS but could just as easily been part of any radical leftist group from the sixties forward to today.It begins with his idealist youth going forward to serve his country and ends with him in allied captivity learning just exactly what evil he and his fellow soldiers had really been fighting for.A most insightful memoir I recomend to all young people with visions of great causes they wish to fight for.
3,Good but could be better,Fun and informative but after only a few times playing the content was all used up! Not enough to keep my little animal lover interested for long. Could have been much more than it is! Appropriate for young children.
4,Good brass tube,I could not find any brass tubing this size at my local hardware. The item was shipped fast and was as described.
1,No THrill Here,Poorly constructed movie bordering on the absurd. Characters made no sense at times and the acting was really bad.Don't waste your time unless you have absolutely nothing else do.
1,uh.............what???,"I've popped this movie in my dvd player on so many occasions trying to watch some D-rate horror movie from a $5-for-4 movie titles combo pack. Each time, I lose interest once the pregnant white trash couple trying to sell their baby to some yuppies starts fighting with...each other and/or The Yuppies who want to buy their white trash baby? I honestly have no clue, because I know that's when the ""action"" is supposed to begin, but honestly, it never comes. Even at the end of the movie when there's supposed to be some suspense and tension between the catty women and one of the dudes is crazy or something, nothing happens, I still didn't care, and I still didn't know what the hell was going on aside from White Trash Mom has been narrating this story to some trucker who picked her up on the side of the road. Credits roll with sappy--not scary!--music, and I don't even know what I just did with 90 minutes of my life."
2,Had no idea what this was about,"I got this for a friend who loves Jeffery Donovan, we were confused the entire time and felt like idiots when it ended. If you have to google what the real meaning is then they didn't do a good job getting the message across."
2,Just ok,"Too many European ""stars"" and few united states stars. Those of us who remember the eighties can remember american starlets in the nude"
2,The only 80's in this dvd is the Music,"After having purchased the Saucy 70's vol. 1 I was super pleased. Out of curiousity I purchased the 80's edition and I am certainly not impressed. There is no dialouge narrative, the scenes are short and cut up, there's quite a few actresses that don't even bare all."
3,Enjoyed It Some,"The celebs are mostly people I do not know and the reproduction is of poor quality, but shows what it says it will."
5,collection,"I have a collection of UNBUILT figures related to World War 2. I do not collect these items as toys nor do I build them. I will say that a purchase of a ""TAMIYA"" model is worth the price and time. Sorry I could not be of more help."
5,VERY REALISTIC AND HART WARMING STORY LOVED IT!!!!!!!,"This book tells how things realy were back then. When Mr.Robinson told his story, he did not sugar coat anything. You don't find this in alot of the other books that were written about the Nego Leagues. I highly recommend this to book to any baseball fan."
2,taste bad,"The product might work, but it doesnt taste that good, so it's hard to drink. It's better if you mix it with the actual fruit. The are a few recipes on the box that give you some pretty good ideas, but even with that it's not the best tasting smoothy"
5,What a talent for one so young,"I have had Gareth's album now since it was first released in the UK in the Autumn and not a day has gone by when I have not played it. The balance of ballads, and upbeat pop songs is perfect and the whole album flows from track to track. Gareth's voice for an artist so young (is he really only 18) shows such versitility and depth, I know this guy will be on the music scene for a long time to come. Thoroughly enjoyable, definately a MUST HAVE!"
3,it's okay,"I'm not really a big fan of this kind of pop, so when I heard his first song, ""Anyone One Of Us"", I first tought this [stinks] and switched to another channel. But than I saw the clip on tv en you know, it was in Venezia and cuz I've been there this easter I watched his clip and in the main time, I heard his song for the first time for real and later, I saw him in Top Of The Pops and I was sold. His voice is sooooooo great that I have forgotten that I hate his music!!!! He is the best singer - after Marco Borsato, Kurt Cobain (etc) - anyway, better than the winner from Idols in GB!!! (he was 2nd, how is that possible?????)so buy it!!!!"
4,Wow,"I was impressed by the amount of fast numbers on this cd. I loved the upbeat songs and just adored the slow ones. ""Too Serious too soon"" is a great hit. So is "" Downtown"" it just keeps me going! If you haven't bought this yet. Go for it. Also if you like POP you will love this cd."
4,OOOO RAH,"A very readable history of the USMC written by Victor Krulak, who served honorably throughout his enitire life. He share's insights as to political hurdles in it's history as well as sharing first hand knowledge reguarding USMC leadership throughout his tenure. A related book, which enlightened me about the author, is Brute a biography. I wouldn't have believed a biography about a person here to for unknown to me could be so interresting and informative!"
2,"Great Seller, and about the book","The Order was great, it came quickly to me in great condition while I was in the middle of deployment. This shipped to me when I was halfway around the world and for a good price too. The seller was nothing but professional. But the book isn't so great. Yes, unfortunately it is the Commadant's choice book for the reading list, but it is dull and put me to sleep plenty of times, and I love reading. There were only two chapters of the book that I actually enjoyed."
4,Lots of interesting anecdotes,The general served for many years and remembers many interesting tidbits personally and relates information about subjects that are usually a snooze for me in a way that kept me interested throughout.
1,Worst Marine Corps book...,"By far this is the worst book on Marine Corps history I have read. As a avid reader, history enthusiast, and a Marine. I had a extremely hard time reading this. Even in the field I found reading ""On Combat"" a much better read. Not just the fact it was much better written, but much more useful knowledge contained within it's pages.The only reason I would recommend this book is to a fellow Marine. Reason being, someone with stars on their collar said it should be on the commandant's reading list. My advice to them is to suffer through it. has to be done for the check in the box."
5,First to Fight: An Inside View of the U.S. Marine Corps,"My mother married a Marine QMSgt. and had never been away from home in Lousiana. The first transfer they made was to theVirgin Islands. St Croix to be explicit and that was where I was born.That was the beginning of a rather unique life. So I was born and raised in the Marine Corps. Where my Dad went we went with him and I heard hints of so much that General Krulak wrote about and added to a lot that I had heard. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, laughed in parts of it and understood other parts better.This book might not interest people who have never lived in the ServiceWe lived in South Carolina, LA, Haiti, Hawaii and Calif. We were in Hawaii when Pearl Harbor was attackedI wouldn't trade lives with anyone. This book was a joy to read.Thank you Amazon!!"
4,Good Intro the USMC,"I would recommend this book to anyone seeking to learn about the US Marine Corps. It is a good overview of the history behind the USMC, and illustrates the mentality of Marines. It is good background for anyone who is a fan of military history and wants to better understand the differences in the way the Marine Corps fights (expeditionary) versus the Army (occupation). Or at least understanding where the line used to be. I further recommend the book for anyone in the Army trying to understand some of the growing pains as we seek to shift to more of an expeditionary force.Krulak does a masterful job of blending his own personal journey and experiences in with the Marine Corps' history. I intended to read this book slowly over the course of several weeks, but found that I was hesitant to put the book down at the end of each chapter and finished much sooner than I had planned."
4,Highly Recommended,This book has been recommended to me numerous times by a whole slew of senior Marine Corps officers. It provides a well rounded picture of the USMC.
5,The Patchwork Girl of Oz (Books of Wonder),"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (Books of Wonder) by L. Frank Baum being the 7th title in the oz series is also the strongest and best developed story so far and here we have a new feisty and strong willed charachter addded to oz, i.e., the patchwork girl which is a doll come to life with a wonderfully free spirited personality and basically steals the show in this magnificient story where we also get to meet Dorothy, Ozma, the scarecrow and tin man to mention a few of the old and beloved charachters. I can not say enough good things about the patchwork girl since she is nice breath of fresh air in oz and her way of looking at things is quite refreshing and new to an otherwise quite stale mindset. This is a splendid series and I can not wait to read the next book."
3,A must for fans of Oz,"I was surprised to find out that Baum himself had made a go at putting Oz on the screen, only to be frustrated in his attempts to get his work seen in the tightly controlled film market. When I saw it for rent, I had to to see it for myself.It's colorful, ambitious, and has a very positive view of human nature. Heck, the title character is pretty feminist, even by today's standards.This film, made for kids, is probably best seen by older Oz fans who can look past the technical limitations of the age and see just how Baum himself wanted Oz to look on film."
4,Wonderful addition to the world of Oz....,"I was impressed again by the land of Oz.. a great chapter reader for school children, or any adult that lives a lil fantasy and imagination."
4,The personal story of a NOK*,"*NOK = Next Of Kin. This diary-like book is authored by the surviving brother of a World War II casualty from the wreck of the HMT Rhona. The Rhona's story is one of the war's best kept and tragic secrets and Bennett's book, while it could have benefitted from more extensive editing, is a moving tribute to his brother and the other 1,000+ men who perished when she was attacked. Interesting, bittersweet reading."
5,"heartbreaking, ultimately heartwarming too","This is a Must readif you are interested in the artisitic community , in Russiawhose endurance was un imaginable during these times..This is also a love story. Very much so.Surprisingly, not without humour& astonishing testament of friendship.Their creativity, miraculous amidst so much strife.Here is a witness, hersOne of the truly important and fascinating memoirs of the 20th centuryYou won't be boredbut maybe amazed......"
3,Slow but interesting Historical Content,"Yesterday I finally finished this memoir by N Mandelstam about her husband, the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam. The book, however, to me felt less like a biography of a person then a memoir of a time. The Mandelstam's lived through a terrible period during the reign of Stalin. The historical information was, in parts, new to me, but I found the book itself ponderous to get through. Very late in the book the author actually gives some insight into how M (as she refers to him) composed his poetry, but I would have liked to have known more about the man as a poet rather than the intricacies of where they had to hid on any given day. I guess I was looking for more Anne Frank in a sense.This is a memoir I would suggest more for those interested in Russian history rather than poets (like myself)."
3,Sorry to dissent; but it isn't as good as their first,"This is this version of Seatrain's second album. Their self-titled albumn is, in my opinion, simply better that this. So I can't give this five stars.Don't get me wrong. Seatrain is a great group. I bought both of their albumns when they came out in the 70's, and loved them both. The combination of country style lyrics and guitars, with rock elements, and even some jazzy improvization is unique, creative, and works very well.But if you are looking for an introduction to Seatrain, go with their self-titled albumn first."
3,Strictly for Lawyers,"This book is an overview and critique of constitutional doctrine in areas such as federalism, freedom of speech, and equal protection. Fried writes economically, has argued constitutional cases before the Supreme Court, and offers fascinating insights into the nature of constitutional adjudication. However, the reader should know that Fried's analysis is narrowly legal, and almost devoid of historical, biographical, or political context. In fact, the discussion is so abstract that readers without a constitutional law background will have difficulty following the analysis at many points. On the other hand, readers who stay abreast of these issues will enjoy the book. (I'm a former lawyer.)"
1,I'd rather be doing anything else...,This book is entirely too complex to understand. It tends to jump from topic to topic without ever clearly explaining the various factions involved in regulating children's television content and programming. Hendershot succeeds in being both condescending and boring in her approach to the study of children's television.
1,Worse than worthless!,Oil seeps from the windows on the sides. Had to keepa towel under it to protect the surface where it wasplaced. I threw it out. Does not rate high enoughfor the 1 star I am obliged to give it for thisreview.
1,18/8 stainless steel oil canister,"This is a made in India, 18/8 stainless steel and not 18/10 as described. The lid does not close tightly and an irregular closing line seen. The weight is quite nice but far from the kind of quality seen in Calphalon products. Nice design but I wish the workmanship is finer."
3,nice colour and accents but initially tight,"The colour and design of this show is very smart and versatile, and I have received loads of complements for it. I am generally satisfied with the purchase, except on the first couple of wears, the shoe is not soft enough and gave my feet sores. Stretched it a bit, and hopefully now good to go!"
2,COMMON SENSE STUFF,"Book is full of common sense ideas and stories from various people including the author about child rearing. Since the book is somewhat sold as Christian or Biblical approach to nurturing a child, I find the NUMEROUS uses of of the term and reference to ""magic"" inappropriate. For example phrases similar to sprinkle magic dust, magic spray, mommies make magic are commonplace througout the book. I would have returned the book however since I live overseas I would have paid just about the purchase price to do so. Skip this one - I prefer Creative Correction, Bringing Up Boys or Mom's Everything Book for Daughters."
5,Extra Sections!,"I love these colored pages! I also purchased the colored tabs and then put matching sheets behind each one (I am a little OCD, I like things like this). Anyway, four new sections were born and my planner took on a new level of organisation and usefulness.Not much else to say, at the end of the day, it is colored paper that fits!"
3,Not the best cartoon about Australia,"I have seen better cartoons about Australia, 'Fern Gully' is a funny and dramatic, but sometimes slowly and long musical experience, that could have been cut down.An old treewitch is released, and now it's up to the beautyful fairy Crysta, and her friends to fight it with their magical power.It's worth watching for some, if you like the natural message of this movie."
2,"Good intentions, disappointing result","It is unfortunate that with such good intentions, this film is hard to watch because of ugly animation and too many clichés! I hoped to find a good film for children, to raise awareness about respecting the environment, and had to force myself to stay until the end of this movie. Hope something better will be made soon: we need this kind of theme, but with quality, beauty, real humor and finesse."
1,"Earth-Worshiping, Brainwashing Propaganda Nothing More","Released in 1992 this movie was part of the modern-day ""Green Movement"" that is now the unofficial Official Secular Religion. It is PURE PROPAGANDA from start to finish.Leaving aside the obviously Pagan elements, the major message here is that human beings are bad and that our very existence is a threat to Mother Nature. Every human in the movie is only interested in destroying the forest for profit. Never mind that wood is used so that we have homes to live in, never mind that all industry provides job so that we can pay for those homes, that does not fit with the Leftist narrative. Humans are always the problem.Next is the production value of the movie itself. My guess is that they spent all their money hiring Robin Williams because the animation and story are sub-par. The music is horrible as well.There simply is not one single positive thing to say about this movie. Other than it serves as an example of what NOT to make."
1,"Preachy, boring, uninspired and","scary in places for little kids. And the music is really bad.I genuinely do not understand why anyone likes this. The story simply isn't engaging for many kids. Either they're too young and don't get the scary parts or they're older and realize how lame it is, and bad the music is. My little boy turned it off about 15-20 minutes into it. We replaced it with Tarzan which is infinitely better. I do realize some kids may like this. I just don't know any of those kids.Nor is this something that adults could enjoy. The animation is not up to the level of other similar movies. Even if you can get past Robin Williams' grating voice, the story is simplistic almost to the point of stupdity. Good animated movies should be enjoyed by both adults and children. I can't imagine any adult anywhere sitting thorugh this drek."
4,nicely done,"Very cute and takes a real look at what people are doing to the enviornment. Hopefully, more people will look at the impact ""humans"" have and what we can do to keep the earth livable."
4,Cute kids movie about saving the rain forest.,"This was my sister's favorite movie when she was 7 years old, so I picked up the remastered DVD for her for her 27th birthday. Not the most exciting movie ever, but it has a good message about taking care of our forests and treating all living things with respect. I was a bit old for it when it came out, but I liked the character ""Batty"", an eccentric bat that had escaped from an animal testing facility, voiced by Robin William. Silly little bat!"
4,Great for kids,"I have to say that some of the previous reviews seem a bit jaded. I first saw this movie as a kid, and I still love it today. Yes, the plot isn't brilliant, yes it's predictable, but it's a movie *for kids* who don't tend to over-analyze that stuff like adults do. The music is fun, the characters are entertaining and the basic principle is good. Yes the animation is ""two dimensional"" but it's done in the old style, hand drawn, so you have to appreciate the work that went into it. All in all, it's a great movie to watch with kids, or as a family event. Don't take it to literally and you'll enjoy it."
4,Great little kid movie,We found this movie in a bargen bin and my 3 year old seems to really like it. Many of the reviewers said Hexxus was too scary for young children but when my daughter saw it she just asked us what he was is fine with identifying it as naughty slime that hurts trees and water. She's now watched this movie several times since we bought it and she doesn't seem phased by Hexxus at all. She is however being really nice to all the plants and trees outside. This movie is a bit preachy for an adult but this kind of cartoon seems to be meant for little kids and if my daughter has to watch a cartoon I'd rather it have some sort of positive lesson rather than no point whatsoever. The main song isn't very good at all and I could have done with out the fairy and human kissing cause that was just weird but in a 3 year olds eyes this movie is entertaining and apparently mildly eductional.
4,Frankenfurter as Black Evil Toxic Waste,"The review for this movie on Amazon says it's an ""Environmentally friendly animated film with a strong message that doesn't club anyone over the head"" WHAT? This movie smacked me right in the face with its blatantly unadulterated political correctness! Let's not pretend that it doesn't. That out of the way, I will say that I LOVE this movie. I saw this in the theater with about 6 other people, all adults and all 7 of us came out of there really happy with it. I have to make a confession though, I am a bit biased, because I love anything, with Tim Curry in it, he could star in the life story of the guy who invented dental floss and I would watch it with glee. That aside, Robin Williams does steal the show with Batty; Hexxus is in a close second. This is one of those rare movies that I will watch maybe once a year, I love when I have to baby-sit and they pick this one out, I thank baby Jesus that they didn't pick out Scooby Doo again."
5,kids love it,kids love it. nice illustrations. good story. nice packaging. good for babysitting the little ones. box fits well in the rack with other dvd's
2,DVD won't play,I had hoped the seller would respond to my post but he did not. I will be cautious from now on about buying from a seller that does not leave contact information.The main DVD in the package is defective and the movie won't play. The one with the extras does play. For the cost it doesn't seem worth it to mail it back.
4,Decent Film...,"I like this movie, even though as a kid hexxus scared me...ALOT. Tim Currey's voice...makes me think of IT so much...and as a kid, IT was my sum of all fears. Anyway, I'm curious if anyone else feels Batty Koda seems like a humorous version of The Plague Dog's Snitter...c'mon...there's way to much similar between the two..."
3,I agree,"I agree with the last reviewer. When I saw this as a young child, the character of Hexxus scared me too. It really left a fairly permanent impression on my brain. Another such movie that freaked me out was The Secret of NIMH. You should at least watch this movie with your children instead of using it as a babysitter."
3,blu-ray has good color but...,shows a lot of scratches throughout the movie. This is why I don't mind paying a bit more for Disney blu-rays. They always restore the movie before putting it on blu ray.
3,movie,finally got her. looking forward to sharing this movie with the next generation. I hope she likes it as much as the last.
5,my favorite cartoon,this cartoon movie has a great meaning behind it. i am 27 years old and this has beena foavorite of mine for many years. i watched it alot when i was a kid and am glad to share it with my 2 children. hoping that they will get the meaning in the movie too.
1,This movie is not really that good.,"I honestly don't know why people like this movie so much. The animation is poor, the songs are just dreadful(acid rain falling down like egg chow mein-seriously!!), and the story is extremely one sided. All destruction is portrayed as being bad. There is only one line in the film that suggests that there needs to be a balance between creation and destruction. The portable lumber mill is just ridiculous; that is not how forests are cleared. If you want to teach children about the horrors of clear cutting, explain it to them in a logical way. If you want to teach them the importance of environmentalism, show them ""Princess Mononoke."""
1,Only you can prevent Ferngully,"This film stinks. Its so preachy like Captain Planet. The characters are uninspired. It also has too many scientific and geographical inaccuracies like the smog coming to life. Even Ren & Stimpy made more sense then this. Batty Koda's rapping sounds like an Eminem song,sung by M&Ms. It tries soo hard to teach us to save the rainforest,it ends up failing in the end. It's also riddled with many mindless filler moments. Think of how many trees they had to kill to make the papers to draw on to make this movie. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
1,a disturbing movie,"this movie is diturbing and weird. It doesn't make sense at all, boaring, dull, nothing happens. Unrealistic and not fun for kids.0 STARS!!!!"
1,Hated it!,**** you Ferngully! Do NOT watch it. The idea of this movie is idiotic. (If u are a boy like me!)
5,Fern Gully,"This is a lesser-known yet no less worthy classic. It provides a good moral for children (save the rainforests), while remaining entertaining and enjoyable. The early '90s lingo will make you laugh (thoroughly bodacious dude), and the whimsical ""Batty"" will, too. But then he's voiced by Robin Williams and when isn't Robbin Williams good for a laugh? Two thumbs way up for this likeable family film."
5,Really good movie,"I watched this movie when I was a little girl and loved and I still enjoy watching it. It's so much better then the crap on TV these days. I would recommend it to anyone. Robin Williams is a hoot in this, and there are so many good lines."
4,educationally enchanting,my granddaughter who is 7 loved this video. i also enjoyed it. it gives you a perspective on how we're encroaching on what should be protected.
5,Great movie,"This was one of my favourite movies when I was growing up. The story plot is fantastic, the songs are beautiful, the whole movie is amazing from start to finish. If you have children, buy this movie, for it's sure to be a family favourite. And if you don't, buy the movie anyways! It's a wonderful movie for people of any age."
4,lizzy loves it,"My grandaughter has had color preference since birth. This book is among the ""bed books"" when she sleeps at MeMas'. Ella knows what she likes and sticks to her guns. The rest of the family has a different opinion - but honor hers. Ellas friends ""get it too"". Toddler validation. Who can argue?"
1,Slippery Shoes,"These shoes looked great, but performed very poorly. Spikes came with these shoes, but they were not permitted on any of the tracks in our area. The plastic bottoms wore down after the second competitive track meet. After that, she slid every time she tried to run or jump while wearing them. They are useless to her now."
2,perugina classic white chocolate bar,About equal to the Lindt white chocolate bar available at Walmart for less. Not as good as the Lindt white chocolate truffles.
5,my favorite white chocolate,"I've tried over 20 different white chocolate bars and this is my favorite by a good margin. My search for good white chocolate began years ago when I realized the caffeine in dark chocolate would sometimes give me a migraine. White chocolate has much less caffeine that dark chocolate but its also a struggle to find a tasty white chocolate bar--they just don't get the same love dark chocolate does. Most white chocolate doesn't taste like chocolate (rather they taste like vanilla and sugar) but this white chocolate has a distinct, rich chocolatey flavor. Its not the same flavor as dark chocolate but its a great flavor in its own right. Its my favorite white chocolate so far."
2,There's a sucker born every minute......,"Seriously, who invented this toy? It looks like a mixing bowl with wings and two holes in the front. Give your kid a mixing bowl from your kitchen and save yourself $30. I promise you your kid won't sit in it (although it does make a great weapon when thrown across the room, as I recently discovered when my 2 year old flung it at breakneck speed). Makes a great step stool for toddlers to climb on to forbidden surfaces, too. As you can tell, I don't care much for this toy. I am picturing the manufacturer of this toy laughing all the way to the bank!"
3,"Incomplete ""Complete"" Pond Kit","You have to love a product that calls itself ""Complete Pond Kit"" that in step four of the instructions asks you to use a separately purchased ""Beckett's Pond Underlayment"" before using included liner. Sigh..."
2,half good...,The liner is what was expected. However the flow of the pump is not what would be needed for a pond. I would certainly suggest buying the pump and liner seperattly and decide on your own water feature after the pond is set up.
3,Not totally satisfied,"I got the product in good time and everything was in perfect condition when I got it. However, after only 2 weeks of running the pump it went out. I tried to contact the seller and I was never able to get a response from them. I ended up having to go to the local Home Depot to buy a replacement. :/"
4,I Like,Arrived as described and appears to be of good quality. Many bags in this package and overall was a decent price for what you get.
5,Good for builders and hoarders alike.,"the bags are good quality, strong, and does the job great. If you are a builder then you can put your pieces you are replacing or swapping out in the bags for safety and if you are merely storing you can do the same thing. They made me feel easier with my graphics card. They can hold some pretty decent pieces. A high end graphics card being one of those."
5,This is a great CD,"I haven't heard many recordings of Mozart's Overtures, but this is the best that I have heard. Hans Vonk and the orchestra do a wonderful job on this CD. I highly recommend this CD for it's price and the great music that it has on it."
1,Danger! Danger!,My wife bought this chair for me and I was really looking forward to relaxing on our patio in it. The first time I sat in it I was very pleased with how comfortable it was. The second time I sat in it the rear legs buckled and I was dumped on my back on the concrete. The chair is supposedly rated for 300 lbs; I'm 6-2 and 250 lbs. If you're a bigger guy and you buy this chair you better have an ice pack and a good chiropractor on stand-by.
4,Trigun Cross,"I bought this having a much different image in mind. It's made with durable, heavy metal. The detail is beautiful, but the back side is dissapointing. There is no detail whatsoever on the backside, just a flat surface. It doesnt look anywhere near as cool when the cross flips over and all you see is the flat side.The chain it was on was very nice, and it looks very durable. If both sides had been detailed so beautiful, I would have given it a 5. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, but it could of been better."
4,Not bad,I bought this just because I wanted something to remind me of the Trigun series besides the series themselves. I like the detail and the chain but I was expecting it to have the same amount of detail on the back of the cross. It's nothing more then a flat smooth piece on the back.
4,Great Item,"I bought this necklace at an anime convention. Beautiful necklace. My only problem is when I let my brother wear it, it looked like he was wearing a chocker. The chain is too short!"
5,Really nice ring for the value. I wanted something shiny for myself not just white gold. And this really does it.,This ring is really great and person who sold this is Katarina's in New York. And it's something that's better than simple white gold ring most people might settle with. Why should girls have all the fun?
5,DIVINE JACKIE VOCALS,"This is a re-issue of Jackie's original 1963 LP 'Merry Christmas From Jackie Wilson'. As ever, Jackie's vocals are class absolute. On this CD Jackie performs with care and beauty and retains the original beauty of the all-famous songs. All too often Christmas versions are jazzed up and messed around losing the original feel of the song. Not so with this LP - all arrangements are tastefully produced. This is an album where Jackie slays the likes of Perry Como, Nat King Cole and any other singer you care to mention. I don't just play this around Christmas time - I play it in the heat of the Summer also! So this gets a big thumbs-up from me - Jackie you truly were CLASS."
1,Awful!,I tried to listen to the album a second time and couldn't bear it. I cannot think of another word other than awful to say how bad this album is. I love Jackie Wilson and was excited to see this CD. He sounds as if he was out drinking all night before he recorded this album.
4,Emerging with the Evangelicals,"Fairly done. Carson always impressed me ever since I visited his class when shopping around for a Seminary to attend in the mid 70s. A lexical mind bordering on brilliant at his worse, Carson engages in the topic in a fashion that will allow you to make a decision. He does make some claims but tells you when he does that. It is a well done guide book to the movement. Personally, I think he nails the topic rather well and helps to validate to the movment some essentials which they do lack. In my own book, ""Under Orders: A Spiritual Handbook for Military Personnel"" available here on Amazon too, I also engage the post-modern phenomenon associated with the thinking process of our culture today. While my emphasis is on practical theology, I essentially affirm Carson's viewpoint in my own words, ""post modern thought brings much to the table but needs the balance of sacred text and historical precedence for continuity and orthodoxy."" In all, good stuff and worth having!"
2,Good but hard to read,This book is for the intellect. It was very hard to keep my mind on the facts. There were too many difficult sentences and words to make this interesting and informative for me. Sorry! But I am sure it is truthful.
5,Relativizing the Relativizers,"D.A. Carson's treatment of the presuppositions behind the 'emerging church' movement is thoughtful, well-reasoned, respectful, and un-compromising. This book is highly recommend for anyone who is wrestling with contextualizing the Gospel in post-modern/post-liberal environs."
3,"Important reading, with a grain of salt","The cautions put forth in this book are good ones, and I think emerging church types would do well to read them. At the same time there is a good deal of misunderstanding here when it comes to the emerging church, and some of the beliefs and practices attributed to the emerging church are not ones that I have encountered."
1,Where's the Conversing,"If Carson actually cared about being open to new ideas and transformation within the Church, he would actually reach out to key figures in the Emergent conversation rather than taking things out of contexts of particular books. The title of the book demonstrates his complete ignorance, as there is not such thing as ""the emergent church."" Emergent is a conversation, re-evaluating and deconstructing our traditions and ""traditional"" approaches that is theological, ecclesial, and missional. Carson and other ivory-tower theologians can wear their suits and ties and sit in their offices all day and correct people when they stray from ""orthodoxy,"" but until i see these guys get their hands dirty and get serious about addressing major problems in the evangelicalworld they inhabit I can't take them seriously (which may be a fault of mine- sorry Don)."
1,"Narrow, Shallow and Not Very Conversant","Honestly I am dissappointed by professor Carson's 2nd rate engagement with the emerging/missional shift. He has many assumptions which he does not bring to the fore front and seems very sure that the Bible is a completely objective arbiter of truth. Yet the Bible is an interpreted and living text. We should all howl at Evangelicalism for burying the Scriptures under a plethora of big church programs and self-help, 1-2-3 psychologizing for a consumer culture. Mind you the emerging movement is being birthed out of a generation that grew up in boomer churches. I find it intriguing that D.A. Carson probably would not have a problem with John Wesley or Jonathan Edwards...but when God's Spirit moves out side Carson's sacred cows all of a suden we're possibly facing a cultish/apostate church?"
1,Diappointed!,"I ordered this game from Amazon.com. They sent it to me via their merchant J&R Music World. It was advertised as being Windows XP compatible. However, after I installed the game and noticed that it wasn't compatible did I see that the box states that the product was meant for Windows 95/98/Me. I have written to J&R Music World and I am hoping that I will get a full refund. I am greatly surprised, due to having had much wonderful experience with Amazon.com. So..be careful when ordering P.C games. I noticed on Amazon's refund policy they will not give a refund if the item has been removed from plastic cover. In my case (faulty advertising) I believe I should get a refund. BE CAREFUL !!"
5,The Best Original Series Show,This was the best show for the original series. I couldn't believe it when Spock 'killed' Kirk. Then his reaction when he saw Kirk was alive was so funny. I'm just surprised Bones controlled himself from teasing Spock for it.
4,Cool espionage show!,"Starts off crazy, but turns into an interesting show.I'm not that fond the Spock in love idea, but the rest of the episode is a winner."
4,A good way to learn what these dirty words mean.,I bought this book while I was working at a bookstore about 5 years ago. I just found it while moving and studied it during the move and found it facinating to learn exactly what some derogatory words mean. Get this book if you can.
3,Cow Allergy...,"I""m sure this is a great product, but if your baby has the slightest milk allergy, do not use this for them. My daughter didn't do well on any cow dairy, and I figured this would be different, but it wasn't. So I had to use Natren non dairy probiotics."
2,Why Shoot the Teacher,This is a lovely film which I first saw years ago. I was very excited to see it was now available on DVD. However prospective buyers should know that the quality of the transfer is extremely poor. Neither the picture nor the sound is to an acceptable standard.
1,"Great film, poor recording","This is a wonderful film. Even after reading the warnings from other viewers, I sent for WHY SHOOT THE TEACHER thinking I could deal with it's imperfections but found I couldn't. It's of such poor quality, I had the stop watching after a few minutes, it was just too distracting. Pity, it's a film that deserves to be in every serious DVD collection."
1,"Hitler's ""Bible""","In 1934 one of Hitler's staff members wrote to Leon Whitney of the American Eugenics Society and asked in the name of the Fuhrer for a copy of Whitney's recently published book, The Case for Sterilization. Whitney complied immediately, and shortly thereafter received a personal letter of thanks from Adolf Hitler. In his unpublished autobiography, Whitney reported a conversation he had with Madison Grant about the letter from the Fuhrer. Because he thought Grant might be interested in Hitler's letter he showed it to him during their next meeting. Grant only smiled, reached for a folder on his desk, and gave Whitney a letter from Hitler to read. In this, Hitler thanked Grant for writing The Passing of the Great Race and said that ""the book was his Bible.""Wonderful book..."
4,canyon winter,"I read this book about five years ago as an adult, a school librarian. I lost track of the title and have been haunted by the book ever since. Tonight I found the title, tomorrow, I will order it for my library. It will fill the adventure nitch in my school library, along the lines of Paulsen's Hatchet, but even more unforgetable because of the hermit."
5,My favorite book as a kid....,"This is the most amazing story of a young child who has to learn quickly and grow up fast. It also teaches a lot about living off of the land. I read this book over 20 years ago and when I finally saw it in print last year again, I had to buy a copy so that I have one. Whether you are a Girl Scout a Boy Scout or just someone who likes adventure it is a must. I recommend it to anyone who loves the outdoors and adventure. If I could have I would have given it 7 stars."
5,Canyon Winter,"I this this is a wonderful book. It teaches respect, bravery, honesty, perseverance, trust, and protecting what you love, like a virgin forest from loggers. I think that everyone should read this book. I would be more helpful, though, if you lowered the price. I had a little trouble buying it. I hope everyone else who read this review will buy the book from you. CANYON WINTER!!!"
4,Wells' social fiction,"Love and Mr. Lewisham is the story of a young man who seeks to better himself and achieve glory through educational achievements. His love life, however, derails this ambition in several different ways. This is Wells' exploration of the dilemmas of the young man torn between career and relationship. Wells fans will realize that the ending of the book did not mirror his actual feelings/behavior on marriage."
2,Muslims' Butt Whooped,"Here is another retelling of the Crusades which saw Muslims' butts kicked by Christian Knights Templar and Teotonic knights. The outcome of the Crusades- blacks, etc are a minority, no one really is 100 percent anything, everything's a British territory. The low rating is because it's nothing special, just a run of the mill library rental."
3,My last Golden Earring album.,"Golden Earring ""N.E.W.S."" #107 (1984).My last album I ever got from Golden Earring. ""N.E.W.S."", is a fairly good release. I really enjoyed ""When the Lady Smiles"", #76 hot 100, the title track and ""Enough Is Enough"". The band is still going today, 50 years on!"
3,"Good, not great","If you are on board with Golden Earring's 70s and 80s output, then this is a good addition to your collection. As with most of GE's albums, about half the songs are good, the rest are OK. There are a few cringe-worthy moments, as with most of GE's albums, but enough good to balance it out."
4,"""Right Next To Me"" is the best!",I first heard this song about 10 years ago. It is one of the most touching love tunes! I've been trying to get this album for years. Was told it was no longer available. Lo and behold here it is!
4,A great 101-level marketing comic for non or new marketers,"I have been using this book/comic for a several years to give some high level fun-reading view on Marketing to non, new or aspiring marketeers. It works great and really help them get a good overview of ALL the aspects of marketing. That marketing is not marcom or advertising it's much much more."
4,The one that turned me on to this band...,"Even know, some thirty plus years later I can still remember the first moment I heard the song ""Prologue"" come out of a schoolmates speakers. When Annie Haslam started to sing I was hooked on this band and the rest is history. This band is just about perfect IMHO. Annies vocals and the other bandmembers compliment one another to a tee."
4,A Prologue to a great career,This is not the best album by Renaissance but it's an interesting and entertaining one.
1,Harduf's Transliterated English - Yiddish Dictionary,This book never arrived! Where is it????Miriam Stein
1,Shoddy Mastering,"This is a review of the sound quality only, look to the other reviewers for thoughts on the music. The recording and mixing are quite good. Unfortunately, the sound was trod upon during mastering. In an effort to get the average volume as close to peak volume as possible, the engineer introduced distortion, and tonnes of digital clipping. Every drum hit suffers from this problem. Also when the music swells, instead of having an increase in volume all you get is an increase in distortion. The dynamic range has been destroyed, the recording stays within 3 dB of max throughout. A definite ""loudness war"" victim.You might still enjoy it though if you listen to your music in a noisy car."
5,Great shirt,This shirt has held up well to washing and still looks gorgeous. The only complaint I have is the high cost of shipping.
5,A Must Have For All Toddlers!,My daughter is 15 months old and LOVES this series. Although I do not think it is the most exciting book (and she has tons!) kids LOVE it. The pictures are simple but colorful and the text is easy for her to understand. She picks out this book night after night. I would very highly recommended any of this series.
1,The 39 Steps DVD,"The 39 Steps is one of my favorite Hitchcock films! The story, the action, the locationsAll great stuff from the master of suspense! Too bad the DVD wont play. I returned itfor another copy, now the new copy will not play the last 20 minutes.Time to try another vendor."
5,wow,"I love this doll's dress. It's design is so cool. And I love her hair,it's so shiny and silky! And her make-up is pretty awesome too."
5,Absolutely brilliant and well written,"Dr. Tice, in this easy to read essay on Mormonism, manages to convey how devoutly she once believed in the religion, and also how much she loves her family and respects their beliefs. The fact that she felt this way and was still able to leave the church shows incredible courage on her part. The book seems to be a fair and balanced accounting rather than a ""hate"" piece, which probably would have been the easier path to take after finally leaving the fold."
1,"A very ""THIN"" book","This is a very thin book, both from the perspective of the number of pages and from the ideas presented. There are many references to Dr. Tice's scholerly PhD work, but this book (pamphlet) only alludes to the depth of her research and her writing and thoughts. Dr. Tice also seems to have a hard time deciding if she wants an emotional, ""Why I left Mormonism"" book, or if she wants a true peek ""Inside the Mormon Mind"" like she promises. In the end, both objectives come up short--or THIN."
2,hummmm.,looks more like a brushed aluminum. how ever the paint did not last after a few washes of the truck and a 2 months the paint is actually fading away.
5,Nalgene Bladder held up well,The Nalgene bladder held up very well during the 11 days my son had on the trail. I would recommend this product as reasonably priced and reliable.
2,Bladder Leaks - Beware,"I purchased this bladder based on the mainly positive reviews from others (at least back then) with the purpose of taking it with me backpacking at my local state park. It started leaking on the trail coming back to the trailhead. My lower back was completely soaked. I tried to take as much air out of the bladder as I could before putting it in my pack, but to no avail. This is a defective product, and I threw it out last week. It seems like the ones made by camelbak are better quality so I'm going to try one of those and hopefully I won't have the leaking issue again."
2,Hose came off connector and leaked water all inside my pack,"On the 4th day of a 12 day backpacking trip, the clear hose pulled off from the black connector when I was inserting the bladder back into my pack. Water flooded the bottom of my pack. Fortunately, my sleeping bag was in a water proof compression sack and was stayed dry. The hose needs some kind of clamp on it to prevent this. From then on, I had to be super careful to make sure the hose did not pull off again when reinserting the bladder into my pack.Despite that, the detachable hose (where it is supposed to detach) and handle are great features to have. I did like not having to unthread the hose to refill. There was also no detectable plastic taste."
1,Pretty junky,"Handle breaks frequently, the tube melted for some unexplained reason, and will have to be completely replaced. Initially I had to trim the tube to get a better fit on the fitting at the bottom where it connects to the bladder itself. The old interface betwen tube and connector had become stretched out and I had never used it before."
1,bad bad design,The hose attachment is very loose and it came apart twice after filling it up with ~3L of water. All the water leaked in my backpack and caused a LOT of frustration!
2,Nalgene bladder,"The product claimed to have a standard Nalgene cap. I assumed it would then fit my filter for backpacking which fits onto my Nalgene bottles. Well, it didn't. I guess their are multiple types of ""standard"" Nalgene caps. This was returned."
5,Excellent Design,"I just received this as a replacement for my Outdoor Products pack. It has certain features which make it superior to any other bladder that I've owned or seen: a wide mouth which makes loading ice very easy (I had to send the Platypus back because the narrow opening made loading ice near impossible); the cap is the easiest on an off that I have encountered; the tube has a nice quick-connect design which automatically shuts off; the mouthpiece has an on/off function; and the handle feature makes filling, emptying and cleaning much easier. I'm ordering a second to replace my wife's camelbak bladder.I'm very pleased with this product."
5,Nalgene,The bladder seems to work well. There have been no leaks. I did what one person suggested and put some lemon juice in it the first time to get rid of any plastic taste. There appears to me to be no after taste. It appears to be a well-made product.
2,Weak hose connection - lots of leaks,"I purchased the 2 L. bladder in May, 2011 and use it daily on my bike commute. By August the hose connection with the bladder had become weak, and began to easily slide off. As noted by other reviewers, this dumps all the water from the hose into the bottom of your pack. I solved the problem by tightening a zip tie around the connection with pliers. Unfortunately now the mouthpiece leaks instead. I expected more from a Nalgene product."
4,Great but could be better,"I really wanted to find this bladder perfect, as I have used Nalgene products for years and love all of them. Overall, this bladder is pretty good, with only a few small complaints.The mouthpiece leaks sometimes. It's nice that it has a ""closed"" position, from which it does not leak, but if it's in the ""open"" position, then I usually feel water dribbling down my leg. I have to open and close the mouthpiece every time I use the bladder, which is a bit inconvenient.The magnetic clip is a great idea for keeping the mouthpiece accessible, but it keeps falling off the pack. I might just end up permanently attaching it to my most-often-used backpack.The bladder does leak if compressed at the bottom (from the hose connection site), but I think that's common to most bladders. Had to find that out the hard way :)"
2,Leaked during second backpacking trip,"I purchased the Nalgene 3 liter hydration bladder for backpacking. On my first trip to Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky, I had no problems with it. It worked perfectly, no leaks and an ease to use. However on my second backpacking trip this past August to Dolly Sods Wilderness in West Virginia, the hydration bladder leaked like crazy. It soaked my backpack with water and made the trip a bit less enjoyable, hydration-wise. At the end of the weekend trip, I just filled my bottle from the creek and used my Aquamira Frontier Bottle Filter, another Amazon.com purchase, which worked great.I believe the leak is from the attachment of the hose to the plastic bladder. I'm not sure what to do next trip if there is anything I can do to salvage the bladder from leaking. If anyone has an idea, please post it. Other than the leak, it is a good bladder but leaking is a major concern."
1,Dead on arrival,"Well, you could say this was dead on arrival.As soon as I filled it up with water, it began leaking. When I went to take a drink, leaked more. Bad seal where the hose connects to the bladder. And because it leaked on me on the most important day I needed it, I now refuse to buy any Nalgene products."
1,It leaks,What can I say to a leaking Bladder?What can I say to a leaking Bladder??What can I say to a leaking Bladder???
2,Not as Expected,"The product received was actually only 1L, not the 1.5L, and the top of the bladder has 2 wholes instead of the hook as the original camelbaks, so it is impossible to hang in the bag-pouch, which makes the whole bag uncomfortable...and since I had to order it to friends in the EU who were coming out to meet me in Africa, I have no other options... Should provide either a better description of the product, or revamp the product to be more compatible with it's intended use."
2,"Amazon, you are NOT shipping the Get A Grip","If you want the Nalgene Get-A-Grip, don't order it from Amazon. They are shipping the Nalgene Reservoir which does not have the handle that the Get-A-Grip does.Like other customers before me, I received the Nalgene CXC Reservoir bladder, not the ""Get A Grip"" model. I didn't order the Reservoir. Amazon you either need to change your product description to match the bladder you are actually selling, or send the correct product."
1,IT LEAKS!,"Just to beat home a point, ITS LEAKS! This was my very first bladder I had ever purchased and didn't want to go with an expensive camelbak. It leaked right out of the box. Upon further inspection it was at the plastic u-bend junction where you stick the hose in....that goes into the bladder itself. It was cracked. A very minute crack at that, but it leaked NONSTOP. I tried to duck tape it, try to even wax it over, but none of these solutions worked. I eventually returned it and chalked it up as defective item, but not so sure anymore since other people are saying it leaks too. Design flaw possibly? I eventually bought a camelbak and instead of there being space (or a U-bend), its one solid piece. Maybe nalgene should try that and they would have a competitive product for sure!"
1,Piece of garbage,Do not buy. Filled it once and it soaked all of my backpacking gear. Not a great start to my trip. Will deinitely return this absolute piece of garbage. Nalgene should be ashamed of themselves.
5,great bladder,"This bladder is pretty awesome. I used it to go on a 3 day hike through the Big Cypress Swamp in South Florida. Not only did it hold up well with about 35 lbs of gear inside the bag this bladder was in, but it stayed pretty cool despite the sun beating down on us. It warmed up by the end of the day, but I really can't complain when it's about 85 degrees outside and the water remains ""room temp"" in the heat of the day. It is quite durable."
4,Great bladder but keep away from cats,"I loved this product when it worked, However after staying with a few different friends over the past couple months, every one of their cat's found it and riddled it with tiny holes! I'll probably buy it again but make sure it's kept out of reach of animals, they really seem to love it for some reason!"
3,Okay for daily use!,"The bladder is okay if you use up the water daily and wash it and dry it but if you plan on storing water for 2-3 days or longer, don't believe this statement on the amazon page ""Contains Nalgene Aquaguard anti-microbial formula which helps prevent growth of bacteria and mold"". I am not sure if i would really want to reuse it after seeing black mold in the bladder since there is really no way to properly drain it. But again it is a good product if you use this pack for daily use only."
2,leaks,The first three times were great. Then it started to leak where the hose connects to the bag. That was an easy fix. Just tied some twine around it super tight. That leak stopped. But then I noticed it was leaking where the bag connects to the filling ring. Sorry I don't know the technical terms. The leak is bad enough so the bottom of my shirt is almost dripping after three hours of being on my back. I'll still use it for short hikes where I don't have to worry about stuff in my pack getting wet.
2,Hose attachment DISASTER,"I was very excited to purchase my nalgene bladder, considering camelbak to be grossly overrated. I am currently abroad and brought my 2 liter bladder with me to make carrying water while backpacking and traveling much easier. But to my dismay, the second time I used it, the hose flat out came off of the attachment to the bladder. 2 liters of water soaking my hostel dorm floor, and pack, later...I realized what the problem was and was more than disgruntled. I tried reattaching the hose and filling it up another time, with the same result. The hose simply will not stay attached to the bladder attachment, and this results in wet packs, wet backs, and no water left to drink. All around bad news. I would not recommend this bladder and I will be returning mine upon my return to the States.PS if anyone has any quick fixes for this, i'm all ears. Not going to be back home for another five months so I need to think of a way to fix this...and fast.Thanks."
5,Practical Advice From a Great Mystic!,"Fenelon's thoughts as presented in this devotional classic are remarkably practical and applicable today just as in the 17th century! He covers such subjects as the use of time, recreation in the Christian life, facing temptation, and knowing God's presence. Part 2 of this book is a simple yet profound look at the creation doctorine, justice, atomement, and divine love - not as a systematic theology, but as a living faith. Fine inspiration for Christians who hunger and thirst after righteousness!"
2,I'm not thrilled.,"The candle itself is fine and smells great. It's the description of the item on-line I have a problem with. It said it comes in three sizes: small, medium, and large with no actual weight or dimension listed. I ordered a large candle for $28.00 and what I got was an 8 oz size. So, I suppose their ""large"" size is 8 oz for $28.00. Either I got ripped off, or their ""small"" candle is the size of a pea!"
5,Works Great!,Very easy to setup and works great! Have not tried it with a wireless keyboard or mouse.
4,works fine,"After a couple weeks I haven't yet run into any hiccups, but note I haven't exercised the sound swapping aspect (no need). I was able to easily & quickly change the hot-key swap sequence to 2x CTRL, which is much more convenient to hit than SCOLL LOCK. My mouse is ps/2 plugged into a belkin ps2=>usb adapter plugged into the KVM; no problems there. Very good product overall.Two minor quibbles:1) as documented, there's no button to make the swap; a keyboard sequence is the only way, which somewhat annoys my spouse2) as undocumented (I think), the usb ports on the keyboard become non-functional when the keyboard is plugged in to the KVM. I had hoped to have 2 mice in the setup (my ergo one plugged into the KVM, and my spouse's traditional one plugged into the KVM'ed keyboard), but no dice; indeed, I can't get *any* device to work from the keyboard ports: ipod, printer, external drive, silly little keyboard vacuum, etc."
2,Caution: This unit will not work with a Bluetooth wireless keyboard and probably will not work with any wireless keyboard.,I bought this device so I can switch between my desktop and my laptop computer. When I hooked it up I found the hot keys would not work and there is no software or manual way to switch. If I powered down both computers the unit would recognize the first one to come up but there was no way to get it to switch to the other computer. I called Cables To Go technical support and was told it would not work with my Bluetooth desktop.Also you should know that the USB ports are 1.1 not 2.0. This is probably OK for a mouse and/or keyboard but if you intend on hooking up any other USB devices to it you do not want this unit.
5,Laserlight 15878,"This is a wonderful CD. The Clarinet Quintet is perhaps the greatest of all Mozart's chamber works, K285 is the best of the 4 flute quartets, K80 is his first string quartet, an astonishing work for a child of 14, and K15, written in London when he was only 8, is charming. But my purpose in writing this review is to warn the buyer that he can't be sure what he's getting, as Laserlight has given the catalogue number 15878 to two different products. Just look at the cover of the CD, it's not the CD I just described! I have bought 3 as presents, and in each case the cover and the CD itself said it was string quartets K464 & K465, but when played it was the CD I have reviewed. Those 2 string quartets are also great, so if you really get them you should be happy."
5,A Children's Classic That Will Not Let You Down,"As many others have said here, this is an adorable children's classic that has been read by many children for many decades.I have fond memories of reading this book as a classroom assignment in fourth grade.My oldest son is now in first grade, and I am helping him read this book on his own. We take turns, he reads 3 paragraphs, then it's my turn to read 3 paragraphs.There are many valuable lessons that can be learned from this book. It is about real-life issues such as life, love, boredom, and death. It even provides a lesson in vocabulary, as Wilbur is always asking Charlotte what the big words that she uses mean.This is a perfect book for children ages 6-12. I wish more parents could spend time reading books like this to their children in place of the time that gets spent playing video games and watching TV.This book is a wonderful addition to all the other children's classics that make our world a better place!"
5,Charlotte' Web: A Study of Life,"Charlotte's Web is a wonderufl tale of a young girl, a wonderful spider, and her precious pig, Wilbur. Charlotte saves Wilbur's life and the book is a beautiful story of friendship, love, and loyalty. It truly is a book of life, in that all of the animal characters mirror people in this world who face the challenge of living their lives each day. It also is a tender story of the love of a young girl and a very smart spider who together instill self esteem and dignity in their friend Wilbur. As an elementary school teacher, this book is in my Top Ten Read-Aloud list.Written by Bob Townsend"
4,great,"Charlotte's Web Tyler SiudzinskiWouldn't it be cool to be a character in a book? If I was a character in Charlotte's Web, I'd be Templeton. Why you ask? Templeton likes to eat and if you know me I like to eat. He asks people if they're going to eat the rest of they're food and I do the same. So we have a couple thing in common and that's why I'd want to be Templeton."
5,Special Read Along Version,"The Special Read Along Edition of this classic is designed in size and print to be read along with your child.The 47 black-and-white drawings by Garth Williams bring the story to life. 8 1/2"" x 11"". For all ages. 184 pages. Hardcover."
5,"Re-acquainting with ""Charlotte's Web""","What can one say? This absolutely wonderful children's story deserves to be told and retold, and editions of it should always be coming along. This edition is a great one."
5,Charlotte's Web,"Charlotte's Web E.B. White, 1952, 184pp.By E.B. White 0-06-440055-7Charlotte's Web is about a pig that was born in spring and as a runt. He was smaller than all the other pigs and they would leave the little pig out of everything. Fern, the little girl, saved this pig when her father tried to kill it. Fern wouldn't let that happen, so she keep the pig as a pet. She named him Wilbur and he lived at Fern's uncle's house across the street. Then it was close to winter.

I found the girl's determination and the spider's hard work very inspiring. I recommend this awesome book to people of all ages."""
5,One of the sweetest children's parables ever written,"Before running out with your child to see the recently released movie - take the time to share this wonderfully timeless, touching and human story with your child(ren) in book form. There is always something lost in translation from one media to another - I urge you to at least remind yourself what has been traded off to make a movie of it!"
5,Classic Story,"Charlotte's Web is a book about friendship which encompasses all the good characteristics of a classic story: adventure, comedy, drama, miracles, compassion and love, life and death. I believe E.B. White did a remarkable job in creating a story that would be loved by adults and children alike for many, many years."
4,Catch This Book Right Now!,"Charlotte's Web by E.B. WhiteHey everybody, this book is just for you! It's about a spider named Charlotte trying to save a pig named Wilbur. Also there's a girl that can talk to animals named Fern.This book is great; I couldn't put it down. It was very exciting finding out what happen to Wilbur!I think that the author tried to tell us just because you're small doesn't mean you can't do a big job."
5,True friends are forever !!!,"This book tells us the story of two friends, a pig and a spider. It is a touching and realistic story although the characters are fictional. The spider, Charlotte is a loyal and truthful friend. The pig, Wilbur is very naive. It tells us the importance of friendship. True friends can last for a lifetime. I highly recommend this book to everyone, young and old."
4,Friendship Between Animals,"It's a novel about a pig and a spider who saved the pig.I recommend this book to everybody in the world cos' you'll learn how the spider risked her life for her friend, Wilbur,the pig and how to treasure your friendship between you and your friends around you.You will also learn why friendship is important."
5,The book shows a heartwarming friendship between 2 animals.,"This is a book of 2 friends named Charlotte & Wilbur.It touches your heart as you read.We think Charlotte is loyal,sincere and kindhearted whereas Wilbur is just naive and kind.We want to recommend this book to the people from all walks of life!!!"

5,Excellent classic for All Children,"An enduring classic through the years. A book that should be on every young child's shelf. A story of life and loss as shared by a spider and a pig. Wonderful book! A must read!Evelyn Horan - teacher/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book OneJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book Two"
1,The Audiotape/CD Version,"Warning! E.B. White's narration of his own charming novel is horrid! The truth dawned on me when, as I listened to the author's introduction, he said ""I will read it to you now"" in a most flat, monotone voice. I didn't yawn with boredom through the first chapter, I screamed! (I don't think I made it through Chapter Two.) Caveat emptor.It doesn't even deserve one star; Amazon's reviewer form wouldn't let me submit this with no stars."
2,Not in color!!!,"My son needed this book fast. I was pleased to find the book in hard cover and color. Unfortunately, when we received the book it was not in color. I ended up having to go all over town looking for it. Book was in mint condition, but not color. Disappointed."
4,Good condition,"The book arrived in exellent condition; my only disappointment is that it took longer than usual to arrive - about 3 weeks, I think. Otherwise, no problems."
5,Wonderful Classic Book,I bought this for my youngest granddaughter. I have read this to my two daughters and my two older grandddaughters. It's a family tradition. A beautiful story.
4,Charlotte's Web,"Charlotte's Web is a great story where a pig who is the runt of a litter is saved when Fern begs the farmer to let it live. Wilbur, the little pig, and Fern become best friends. Wilbur soon makes friends with all the other animals on the farm but gets lonely as Fern gets old because he doesn't see her as often and that's when he meets Charlotte. When Wilbur finds out that he is going to be killed and eaten, Charlotte decides to help him by saying wonderful things about him in her web, like some pig, terrific, and radiant. When she does this, it keeps Wilbur from being killed. Wilbur eventually goes to the fair and wins first prize for the best pig all because of Charlotte. The sad part is in the end Charlotte ends up dying but Wilbur takes care of her eggs so that all her babies can hatch.Charlotte was the best friend Wilbur could ever have! This story is sad in the end but it is fun to read and exciting."
5,I read the book and I liked it a lot its a nice book.,I recomend the book to kids it is a realy nice book.Mybook is about Fern.She is a girl that saves a little pigs life.
5,Great Children's Book,"I enjoyed reading this book when I was a child, but now that I read it as an adult I think I like it even more. This is a charming story that all children should be exposed to at some point in their life."
4,I loved the book.,It was the best book I ever read.I liked the part when Wilber got fat.I wonder why Papa tried to kill Wilber?I also wonder how Charlotte made those webs?
5,A very enjoyable book for all ages to read.,"This story is especially a good read for children - it involves many sweet little animals which I am sure all children would be attracted to. Even though this story is sad towards the end, it is made happy again, because lots of Charlotte's little babies are born."
4,charlotte's web,"The novel is called charlotte's web. what it talks about is apig name is willber. He lives in a barn. He was a presnt from a person to thise kid. One day he meats a spider. The spiders name is charlotte.Yhe pig would try running away alot because he was always sad and stuff.The spider was always talking the pig out of the bad things he would always want to do.Like for example when he was running awy she would always talk to the pig about bad things.He runs away and he goes to a vestable, and the pigone a prize for the fatest pig. Then later that day the pig went to a bar and then later that day the spider charlotte died because her eggs ate her. i Really enjoyed reading that book"
2,I liked this book.,I liked this book because it is funny. I liked the way they came up with the characters. My favirote part is when the pig wins first place.
2,"No I did not like the book, becaue,I didn't like the charact",The book was very long. Nothing was good about it. My favorite part was when Wilbur got a bronze metal.
2,"A ""Classic""","Through my many years of reading, writing, playing, watching and whatever else you could think of that involved the media, never have I stumbled across a book so childish that I could call it a true ""could've."" Though this book was memorable in its own right, the storytelling of E.B. White never struck me as ""amazing"", more or less interesting. The adventures of a girl and a farm could've been something very fun and interesting, had the plot been less childish. Though the concept of death is very well portrayed, I feel that it is a little too much for those under the age of 8 who have not fully accepted that concept, and though E.B. White has been known to write good books, in my book, he went a couple inches short of a foot."
1,Pure drivel,"This book was absolutely the worst thing I ever read. My children were scared, horrified, and bored. I found the book to pontificate needlessly, to overdress otherwise humorous and warm situations with disgusting psycho-sexual overtones, and to instill, in myself (at least for a day) and my children (forever?), a feelingof hollow sadness and bitterness at this calous author."
1,Children will hate it,"I read this book when I was 10, and it is one of the dumbest books of my youth. It really isn't anything special. But the thing I hate the most is this; How come they praise the pig for being special when the spider should be the one getting the attention?!?! Kids will hate this book, including me and the whole 5th grade. Also, Kids will not pick up on any morals; adults will not find it interesting either."
5,Never read it before,"I'm 53 and had never read it before. I bought it because my 1 yr old granddaughter said ""Hi Ya!"" to a spider. I was delighted that the book introduced the new word ""salutations"" when saying hello to Charlotte. Also a good story for my 5 yr old granddaughter who has had to deal with the death of 2 pets and a beloved great grandpa."
5,A Life Lesson,"Every year I read Charlotte's Web to the kindergarten class, I am amazed at how engaged they are (and how engaged I am) in the story. Much of it stems from the barnyard setting-a place where few of our children spend much time. It's just plain fascinating for them. Then there's the suspense of what will happen to Wilbur, the pig, what will Charlotte do with her web and, ultimately, what will happen to Charlotte herself. The novel teaches many life lessons in a charming, but practical way. To be cliche, E.B. White has spun a strong web that will hold its reader forever.Bernardette CostaAuthor, The Six Colorful Annies"
4,A pig and A spider freinds?,"A pig and a spider best freinds. In this book a pig and a spider are best frinds. Their names are Wilbur and Charlotte. This took place when a penny was a lot like $1. Wilbur owner was thinking about to kill Wilbur. The pig did not want to die so Charlotte writes words in her web so people would think that the pig was special. Fern did not want him to die because Wilbur was her first pet to take care of. I recommend people to read this book because it is exciting and enjoyable but at the end it is also sad. This book is called ""Charlott's Web and the aurtor is E.W. White. Go out and look for it and read it."
4,Hayley's Webby review,"Charlotte's WebCharlotte's Web is a fabulous book! Fern is an eight year old farm girl who saw her dad attempting to unfairly kill a runt piglet, and she ended up keeping the piglet she named Wilbur. One spring day, Wilbur, the main character, got old enough; he got sold to Uncle Homer and lived in his barn, the setting.On a lonely day, Wilbur excitedly met Charlotte. The next day, an old grumpy sheep told Wilbur they were going to devour hoim for Christmas, the story problem.When it was time to pay the fare at the fair, Fern played with Henry Fussy, too. In the next day, Charlotte met a pig named Uncle whose fat was sure to win the event. Will Wilbur make it past winter by wining first place?This book is very heart warming! Please read this book. I recommend this book to any one and any age!""Amagon raeders, I enjoyed this book."" I say. It is very interesting, touching, and sad."
5,I <3 this book,"About a young girl named Fern who raises a young hog and decides to name him Wilber. When cold comes he is sold to Homer Zuckerman (Fern's uncle). A great book about friendship and care and a spider named Charlotte who met Wilber and cared for him. When Charlotte is dead Wilber takes care of her eggs, her egg sac and her babies. From start to end its a great book."
4,charlottes web- My book of the millenium,As a child i was read this book by my teacher and i really enjoyed it. It is a great novel and shows a great friendship between a pig and a spider. They get up to all sorts of things. This is a great book for all the family and can read from many levels. E.B. White deserves 8/10 for his compasionate novel.
5,Charolette's Web,"I'm a 7th grader at Osawatomie,Kansas and I thought that this book was great for little kids that can learn how to be responsible. Some things I like about this book was when Wilbur meets new friends at the farm and when Wilbur gets there and doesn't even notice Charolette, and then about a couple scences later he looks up and he sees her. After a little while Wilbur finally says something about her web. Somethings I dislike about this book is that Wilbur had to go stay with other pigs that he didn't even know. The part I realy didn't like was when the little girl threw a tempertantrum and ran out the door to go find her pig. I would recommend this book to my aunt because she lives on the farm and she likes pigs. If you like pigs, well this is the book for you."
3,Charlotts Web,"This is a good book it is about a pig runt but a girl saves it. She sales to her uncle the pig meets a spider and they become friends. All sorts of good things happened to the pig while they were good friends. Charlotte, the spider, made an egg sack and died. Wilbur, the pig, took care of the egg sack until the baby spiders hatched. This is a good story, to find out more about it I think you should read it."
4,"Charlotte, you are welcome in my home anytime, sweetie!","I read this delightful book about twice a year. The spider is my favorite. The friendship that the spider forms with the pig helped me to overcome my phobia of insects. I was recently traumatized in a life-threatening incident involving a spider, a small meatloaf and a spark plug, but this story really helped me to get over that hump. Now, with the help of this lovely book, I feel like I, too, can make friends with spiders. But pigs are nice to eat, too! Hee hee. Before I end, I would like to ""shout-out"" to my sister Krissy! She is a hoot."
2,Charlotte's Webb,"The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great. Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape. An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette."
4,Charlotte's web : Comment from 27 years old guy,"I read this book about 15 years ago as part of the assignment when I was in school. Last week, when I tried to organize my books. I accidentally found ""Charlotte's Web"". I began reading this book again and quickly finish within 2 days. The relationship between Wilber and Charlotte would be a good lesson for children. Without the help from Charlotte, WIlber would definitely be killed and even finally it was a little bit sad, but it is the way of life. I wouldn't go for the detail of the story, you should read it yourself. This book is beautifully written and easy to understand. Other animals in the farm also made the story sometimes funny. It will give a lot of imagination for children. By the way I'm now 27 but still enjoy this such wonderful story."
4,Charlotte`s Web,"The book is called Charlotte`s Web. It`s about a pig name Wilber who almost died at birth, but was saved. Now Wilbur lives in the Zuckerman`s barn and he made some new animal friends and a spider, named Charlotte. Charlotte helps him in anyway she can so that he can be safe and happy.What I enjoyed about the book was that some parts of the book were sad and happy. It was happy when he became friend with Charlotte and she helped him. It was sad was when Charlotte had eggs and a few days later she died; and did not get to see her baby spiders.Other people should read this book because it`s a good book about a pig and a spider who help and care for each other along the way."
3,Good story,"Having a dual form of dyslexia I did not learn to read until later in life. Thus I never read children's books while a child. Maybe that is why I read so many still today. I read this as part of a children's literature course in university.It is an interesting book, about friendship, commitment, compassion, change and death. As such it deals with a lot of the big questions of life in ways a child can grasp.For me the most moving part was when Wilber confessed to Charlotte that he did not like the thought of her as a blood sucker, towards the end of her life. Only true friends can be that open and honest.The book is a powerful tale of true friendship and how our close friends can transform not only us but those around us."
5,Buy this for your children,"My boys love the original movie (their favorite part is when Templeton pigs out at the fair), and I decided to buy the book to read to them. They enjoy the story and I think the fact that they've seen the animated film helps, since they're smaller. It's also a great read for little older ones. For some reason children especially enjoy farm or barnyard stories and Charlotte's Web really delves into the characters, which my children love."
5,CHARLOTTES WEB!,"I have read a book called Charlottes Web, and I think that anyone can read it. The story is about how a pig finds his way to a farm. Wilbur has a lot to learn about manners, behavior, and life itself. All the animals in the farm help him achieve this. This is one of the best books by E.B White!!!"
5,A Touching Tale,"Charlotte's Web is a wonderful book for all readers, young and old. This touching tale teaches about the importance and values of friendship, as well as the pain of losing a loved one. The reality behind the events that occur allow the audience to relate to the plot. The sense of loneliness and being without friends and even the event of losing someone that is close to you are all very real events that can occur in any person's life. I recommend this story as a read aloud story or as one to read on your own. I plan to read more stories by this author since I love this one so much!"
4,the best book E.B.White has ever written,The reason I really enjoyed this book is that Fern is alot like me. Fern lived a farm and her family raised pigs and other animals. Fern seems like she would be really nice to meet and she has a great imagination.
5,one of the best,"I'm 31 and still can't get over this book. I read it in my twenties (although I saw the movie as a kid) and still pick it up every year to read. Why? Because it's one of the best books--ever.E.B. White knows how to tell a story. Wilbur and Charlotte are two of the most memorable characters in all of literature. Put them in the same boat as Dorthy and Toto, Ma and Tom Joad, and Holden and Phoebe. Mr. White has written a beautiful book about friendship and redemption, and I found the Christian imagery to be facinating.There are lots of books out there, and if one had to choose the top 50 books in the history of the world, this would be one of them. I've read quite a few novels, but nothing in recent memory was as simple or profound as this little book. It's not just for kids, it's for all people.Also recommended: How to Lose Your Faith in Divinity School"
4,Charlotte`s Web,Itis a very good book. And it is about a runt pig that almost gets killed. The pigs name is Wilbur. And the author name is E.B. White . The illustrator is Garth Willam. I like this book because it was interesting to me.
4,Charlottes Web-VR,"I read this book in the third grade, and through the years it has always been one of my favorites. This book reminded me of how important true friendship is and it made me appreciate alot of the friendships in my life."
5,All-time favorite,"Charlotte's Web is one of my all-time favorite books. The characters seem so real, even though most of them are talking animals! You will become very attached to Charlotte and Wilbur as you read along. Will Charlotte be able to help Wilbur in the fight for his life?"
5,"Lessons of life, love and friendship for us all","I read Charlotte's Web as a child, and loved it. Recently I had the pleasure of rereading it with my daughter, taking on a chapter a day. The descriptive phrases E.B. White uses while helping us to fall in love with the characters and their world are wonderful.I will admit I was concerned reading some parts of the story to a 4 year old, whether it be the ""circle of life"" comments by Charlotte or the fear of Wilbur being killed. However, I took it slow, answered questions when needed and had no problems. Like myself years ago, my daughter had a tear in her eye at the end.I would definitely recommend this book to others, including adults. Friendship and loyalty in the world today seems to be lacking, and we should all take a step back to breathe and appreciate what we have.J.R. Reardonauthor, ""Confidential Communications"""
4,Touching,"As a child Charlotte's Web was read to me. I liked it then and I still like it now, although now I have picked up much more meaning. This touching story of Wilbur the pig not only teaches some important lessons to children (about friendship and love) but it is also a delightful story. I could relate to many of the characters because of the distinct personalities that White gave to each of them. This classic story should be read to or by all children of the world."
5,We enjoyed this book very much.,"Charlotte a kind hearted grey spider, befriends Wilbur, a lonely white farmyard pig. This great bond of friendship begins when Wilbur, had been saved from death at birth, by Fern , a little but brave girl.Wilbur soon has to move to the barn at Fern's uncles place. There he meets Charlotte, wh-o is soon willing to give up her time, and if needed her life to save Wilbur from the mean and cold hearted slaughter. Charlotte soon begins her mission to save Wilbur by keeping Mr& Mrs Zackerman from killing Wilbur, this is preformed by Charlotte sppining words on her web, onthe corner of the farmyard stable.Mr& Mrs Zackerman are so shocked that a hurdle of people came to see this amazing preformance by what they belive to be the pigs doings. This is an emotional and modern classic written by E.B White and is suitible for all ages around the globe. We recomend it for all young and old readers."
4,A good book for young children,"...It is a classic, well written children's book, free of modern slang, violence and bad attitude. The story revolves around a little girl, a pig and a spider (Charlotte). My only reservation is that the story is tinged with sadness at times - not to give the entire story away, the life-cycle of the spider is a key aspect of the story. I wonder if some children's stories sometimes go a little too far in exposing young children to really quite sad (and usually unrealistic) situations. Perhaps though this is a gentle introduction to a part of life which we all encounter sooner or later. They made an animated cartoon of this story some years ago which I hardly recall now; the book is probably a richer experience for a child (and parent) though. A good night time story book."
5,THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS!!!,"Charlett's Web was a wonderful book. Once you start reading it is is hard to put down. I love animals so I really loved how the story was narrated by animals. This book should have won the Newberry Award, if you ask me."
2,Ops,"I thought it was for a 3 yr old....maybe for a 5 the grader..love the story....wished the seller made it more clear, no pictures....and the level for reading..."
3,good quality book,It is a good quality hard-copy book and gives us a good feeling by holding it. And the content is classic.
4,It was a very good book.,"Charlotte's Web is about a pig named Wilbur. He was one of the characters in the story. It was a very good book. My favorite part is when Charlotte, his friend, has babies. She is my favorite character."
4,This story is about a strong friendship.,"This is why I think you should read Charlotte's Web. It is a good way to learn about frienship. Wilbur is a pig and he has a very good friend named Charlotte, who is a spider. Charlotte loves Wilbur very much. Even though she is having babies she travels to the fair to try and save Wilbur's life. Now that is what friendship is about!!!!Read the book to find out more."
5,Whittney's Review,"Charlotte's Web was a very interesting story. I felt that this book was a very thoughtful, and caring novel. I suggest that readers who have not read this book, do so. This novel is about a pig named Wilbur and a spider named Charlotte. Charlotte does something very memorable at the end of the story. Read this book and you will soon find out the exciting story of Charlotte's Web."
3,Some Pig!,"The book I read was Charlottes Web. The author was E.B.White and the illustrator was Garth Williams. My favorite character is Wilber because he is `some pig.' The story takes place on a farm. My favorite part of this story is when Wilbur, Charlotte, and Simpleton go to the fair for the pig show were Wilbur gets second place. Sadly,Charlotte dies laying a egg sack. I learned that all pigs are used only for meat. If you like action I wouldn't recommend this book. This books reading level is for all ages."
4,My most memorable reading experience.,"I was 10. The year I was in fith grade I was assigned to read this book. This was the greatest decision my 5th grade teacher chose for us kids. At night I would stay up late flipping through the pages just being so into this world of animals and great, great literature. When the last page was flipped by yearning for more was not yet diminished. As time went on I realized that that book is complete in itself and tells a brilliant, heartwarming story which will be in the hearts of those who read it forever. All I can say is happy 60th anniversary Charlotte's Web."
4,Charlotte's Web,"Summary: This book is about a girl who has to give away her pig to a farm where the farmer is mean to the animals. The farmers name is Lurvey Zuckerman. This book was great!!!!What I liked about the book: I loved the characters. I liked the cover and the words they use.What I didn't like about the book: There was not a thing I didn't like about the book!by Jack, 8yrs old, Buffalo, NY"
2,Cover doesn't fit properly,"This is just the right size for one martini but the cover doesn't fit properly. You have to really push it down firmly or else it comes right off when shaking, but then it is hard to remove."
2,get what you pay for,"what can i say? you get what you pay for. i bought 4 of these things just to have a set of cold steel cups for juice in the morning. they haven't rusted, but they aren't at all sturdy. i wouldn't use them regularly for martinis. also note that the product is probably way smaller than you might think it is by looking at the picture."
