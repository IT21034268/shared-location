2,The Power of Suggestion Causing More Biting,"I liked the idea of this book, so I checked it out of our local library. Our toddler's biting had been steadily declining, and we had hoped that this book would help to stop it completely. It quickly became my toddler's favorite, so we read it dozens of times over the course of a few days. During those days, her biting increased exponentially. I think it's the power of suggestion. The book keeps the idea of biting at the forefront of her mind, so she bites and bites and bites. I am returning it to the library immediately."
2,Deceptive?,"Advertise 60W. Part number BC40F10 means it is a 40W; I'm not sure about the part number (390294 could be a 60W bulb - discontinued?). It could be argued that it is equivalent to a 60W standard incandescent in terms of luminescence. But it is also billed as a Halogena bulb, and therefore it already has better luminescence. So if you order it thinking you will get a 60W Halogena bulb, you will be disappointed. I think this is deceptive in that you have to know Philips model numbers in order to avoid the trap (if indeed it is one). At a minimum it is ambiguous."
4,Nice light. Prefer over flourescent,I wanted the incandescent look for my decorative light fixture and this has the nice halogen light. It is hard to find the right US style candelabra base type light. Be careful that the fixture can take the heat as these do get warm.
2,A little too Epicurean for me,"I am fond of cooking and cookbooks, and picked this one up sight unseen. While I enjoyed reading the recipes, I confess that the majority of meals look expensive to me and include lots of specialty ingredients that I just don't think will be easy to find or will appeal to my family. I don't cook with lamb, rabbit, or fancy seafood, duck or venison, and while reading about the recipes was different, I confess I was disappointed I was not hankering to make any.I was able to find a few recipes in the main menu, and quite a few in the desserts section, but overall I confess the food looks a bit too epicurean for my tastes and I don't see myself using this book that often. I just don't have a lot of people who will eat ""Soft Tacos with Chipotle-Braised Rabbit, Black Beans, and Pickled Cabbage"", including myself.My advice would be to check out the recipe list included before buying to see if the meals are your speed."
4,Very Informative!,"I found this book very helpful, explaining how things went wrong within the family, andsteps to take to heal and move forward."
4,Great Book!,"Biblically based look at family life in families that are not ""normal."" This book makes several good points, among them time doesn't heal all wounds. I devotes a full chapter to dysfunctional pastoral families. God uses imperfect people to accomplish His Will. This eBook,The Story Of A Dysfunctional Family: Dysfunctional Families Of The Bible--Jacobfor a look at a dysfunctional family that God used to bring salvation to the world."
3,A rather mediocre book,"This book is written in an easy to understand, conversational tone. It presents the bare basics of mac programming as well as the bare basics of C. Though this book is okay, it does not cover much. Instead of purchasing this book, I recommend buying Foundations of Mac Programming, also by Dan Parks Sydow. Foundations is almost as easy to understand and it covers far more."
2,"Way too chatty, thin on information.","I found reading this book to be a tiresome exercise in hunting down useful information spread way too thinly among a lot of useless banter. The organization is good overall but I felt talked down-to. The basic idea of the book is also a good one: to present the basic outling of mac programming in a conversational tone with as little technical jargon as possible for the uninitiated; however, each and every new concept was surrounded front and back with way too many bad jokes and ""chat"". I think that if all of the useful information presented were to be written in about one fifth of the space taken, it would actually be easier to absorb."
3,"Good start book, just start","No doubt this is a good book for starter and in all just that. Some very basic like dialog box design or a little bit advanced like memory management are all missing from the book.However, if you're first on Mac programming, take two days read this book to get rough ideas. Then read 'Programming Starter Kit for Macintosh'. It's an old title but contains some more info. CodeWarrior Professional CDROM includes the whole 2nd book.But, where is a C++ book for CodeWarrior!!??"
4,"Basic, but very helpful","This is a great book for the beginner programmer. Although it does not teach much, it gives you enough to absorb for a while before you want more. It shows you enough to get you started, and has plenty of great examples. My only complaint was how a 350+ page book could be so basic. I encourage beginners to start with this, but do not get it if you've ever programmed in C before (no matter what OS)."
2,This book teaches just the basics of mac programming.,"This book is aimed at the absolute beginner, if you know the mac operating system and want to be a programmer then this is not the book for you. It teaches you from the very basics e.g. creating a file and saving a file. Even when it does get on to teach you programming it teaches you only the very very basics of C. It focuses mainly on using ResEdit to design your interface and no real programming. In all, this book is a huge let down. I recommend one of the other C mac programming books."
4,Good book...but can I have a little more info?,"I am a 12-year-old, and I wanted to start programming. So, I bought this book. I found this to be a good book, but I wanted a little more information. And how the author organized it was a little complicated to me. So, I'm thinking about buying a little advanced book, but I can't find a book for programming for Macintosh. I'd love it if they published ""More Mac Programming For Dummies"", because I want some more information, and ""Mac Programming For Dummies Quick Reference"", because it was a little hard to memorize all of this and I cannot always carry a book this big."
5,Spectacular Book,"It was great, I learned the basics of C Programming for Macs in at least 2 weeks. Great Book!"
5,A wonderful gift!,"I bought this book to present it to a girl who is expecting a baby in early January 2012. I was received with great enthusiasm. I had already read the book and was able to quote from it. Its sense of humor was a great success, I thank you for your prompt service."
3,Take a chance on Chance,"Not a master work, but quite enjoyable. Yet again a story about a school outsider, who first becomes the object of nasty jokes and abuse and then a school star. From zero to hero.The script doesn't leave a lot of to think about. It's predictable, but I don't mind that. As long watching doesn't hurt my brain, it's o.k.Some performances are really good - just check the bitchy friend of Chance, or his funny sister. Chris Mulkey does his best too.On the other hand there are parts which were player bad. To this group belongs for sure the foto-freak friend and the object of Chance's feelings - Levi.The whole story is pleasant enough to give it a try. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed."
5,Wonderful Coming-of-Age Tale that Deserves to be Seen,"It took me a while to get to see the very-well-reviewed 'The Curiosity of Chance', but I finally got around to seeing it and well, I could definitely understand what the fuss was all about.It is indeed a very good movie with some great performances and kickass sountrack; it is quite relatable for most of us, and rings true. It's not extremely profound or anything, but it does make you think over and want to watch it one more time.It seems most of those who saw it, love it, but yet, not a lot of people know this movie at all. It will be a great pleasure for me to share this with my friends and spread the word!! I think more people SHOULD see this movie.I hope it becomes widely recognized over time, becoming a cult or something. It deserves."
2,HUGELY disappointing,"With all the awrds this movie won, I expected it to be quite good, but it simply was not. Bad acting, bad dialogue, and completely unoriginal and banal plot and characters. Perhaps the dialogue was intended to be arch, but the actors just didn't have the talent to pull it off. Instead, everything seemed stilted and fake. Moreover, their lack of talent and/or charimsa diminshed any sympathy that a viewer might feel for them. While the characters are in ""sympathetic"" situations, we seen them all before -- and depicted in much more effective ways. In short, I was bored and unmoved. For a film that deals with many of the same themes, but does it in a more interesting, entertaining and accomplished manner, watch ""Camp"" instead."
5,"AWESOME movie. Entertaining, insightful, and the two main actors are HOT!","I first found out about this movie by stumbling upon a YouTube trailer for it. Unfortunately it never got a chance to be a ""blockbuster hit"" at the theaters, probably because it wasn't mainstream enough for the average American family, but it should have been. Not only is it entertaining, but it really shows how it is for high schools kids who are military transplants, and/or who are openly gay in high school.Highly recommended. If you've never known what it's like to be gay or different in high school, you should really watch this video. If you are gay and maybe experienced some rough times dealing with other kids in high school who picked on you, this would be a good movie for you also. Oh, and the actors they picked, especially Brett Chuckerman and Tad Hilgenbrinck, are HOT!"
5,"Practical, insightful, helpful","I truly enjoyed reading this book, not only as a preparation for taking the GRE general test, but also as a tool for self-enrichment. I admit that I don't agree with everything the author put into the issue or argument essays, but, that's hardly the point for reading this book, isn't it? The sample essays are truly extensive and exhaustive, serving as good models for students who might not be familiar with GRE writing. Moreover, very often I find that the essays jump start my own train of thoughts, challenging my point of view on an issue or argument, and that's a big part of reading this book is about, I believe.This book truly epitomizes the saying - learning by doing."
2,Only 1st section is useful,"like titles says... 1st section is useful. Essays themselves are outdated and not really written well. Author says himself that he was not under pressure of time and had time to think it thru, in the end all his essays contain some sort of reference to work of Shakespier or some statistics. How sitting on GRE test I will come up with all these sources? So do not waste your time on 2 nd 3 rd part of this book, but do read thru the 1st one!"
5,Very helpful!,"There is no way you'll be able to memorize all the essays in this book so if that's what you're looking for, forget it. If, however, you are looking for tips on how to prepare for the essay portion of the GRE, common themes you'll find, and you want to review well thought out essays for every possible essay topic (just to get ideas and to get your creative juices flowing), this is the book for you. I thoroughly enjoyed using it as a study guide and found myself well prepared when I actually sat down to complete this portion of the GRE. As I wrote, so many ideas came to me, many of which were touched on in the book. My score was a 6.0!"
2,Not a good preparation material for GRE writing section,"I did not find this book to be very helpful in preparing for the GRE. The topics presented in this book are not like at all from the GRE's. They more like fragmented titles than complete GRE style essay topics. For example, one of the arguement topic in the book is ""Comparing cold medications"". You won't see a topic like that in GRE. To get better ideas about GRE essay topics, look at the topic list on the GRE web site.The reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 stars is that Do's and Don'ts section in Part I of the book is pretty good. However, you can find those kind of information elsewhere for free too."
1,Warning,"This is normally a very good product. However, I NEVER received it when I ordered it at Amazon. I have sent a letter to the seller. I got back an unhelpful reply. I hope it will be resolved. I can not afford to throw my money away."
4,Forgiven,"Some of the songs on the album will appeal to the children, but still have an adult message. ""He's Alive"" is probably one of the greatest songs about Christ's resurrection; ""I Don't Care Where You've Been Sleeping"" is a song to which most of us can relate and is very powerful, as is ""Adam, Where Are You?"" God's unconditional love is a very real theme in this album, although not a ""new"" contemporary Christian artist, his songs are timeless and have had special meaning for me over the years. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,"Good, basic book","This is a good, basic book with messages about body image, eating well and exercising to stay healthy. I bought this book for my five year old daughter. I expected a little more content so I didn't give it the highest rating. But, it does provide a good basis for reminding my daughter, when she brings things up, that whatever shape and size we are is the perfect one for us and it doesn't matter if someone is different, taller or shorter, etc."
1,"Sadly, one of the worst goddess type anime","The story is your typical loser guy meets goddess. The premise of the story starts out very exciting then it just became a very very shallow story about DearS being nothing but a bunch of boring alien slaves.Takeya the main guy is so obnoxious he acts like he's 10 yrs old boy rather than a high school student. Many typical boy resists sexual temptation scenes and rejecting sexual advances from a hot girl. Not believable at all.The story progression is quite boring and lacking of any serious plot.It takes on a bit of flavor from Chobits, Urusei Yatsura, and other animes.Definitely a rental."
2,Not flexible,"It's hard to break into the shoes. I have worn them many times and they still hurt, still stiff."
2,CD-ROM not useful to experts,"The included disc is of limited use to readers who already own File Maker Pro. Aside from the demo version of the application, the only other substantive content is a set of example files. These files are pre-fabbed databases for inventory, employee information, etc. They are servicable, but the key problem is that they all locked out. You cannot open their layouts or view their scripts to see how they were made. As a result, the instructional potential of the book is severely limited. Further, the book is so preoccupied with promoting FMP that it never discusses FMPs limitations-an important consideration when creating real world solutions.There really isn't a great advanced FMP programming book out there. O'Reilly, are you listening?"
5,Bomb Azz Album,"The Chronic is by far one of the best rap albums of all time and is a must have for any true fan of rap. It is smooth as hell, and has great performances from many of Death Row's finest. I rate it up there with Ready to Die and All Eyez on Me."
2,pretty but ehh,"As beautiful as the bowtie is, it fell apart within 4 hours of being worn to a Christmas party. We didn't touch it, adjust it, or take it off until someone pointed out that it was undone."
4,Fire ecology,"Robert Whelan has written a well balanced book on fire and the ecological effects of this most important environmental (natural) perturbation. Whelan explains the effects of fire on different ecosystems, tolerances of plants and animal populations, including community response to fire. Fire phenomenon such as chemical and physical reactions, fire behaviour and regime are well covered and discussed in depth.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in fire ecology, whether student or not. In fact I have made the book the prescribed textbook for the module in fire ecology I lecture in."
3,Disappointed,These shoes were not at all what I normally expect from Clarks - there was no cushioning or arch support at all. They were uncomfortable as soon as I put them on. I've noticed lately that the newer lines of Clarks are lacking on the comfort side - I guess I will have to start trying before buying.
3,Not the best.,"I got these recently in my normal size 8.5, medium width. They are TIGHT. More specifically, the back of the shoe is digging into where my achilles tendon is...and well, you can imagine how much fun THAT is. Also, there really is no padding whatsoever in the shoe. I have 3 inch heels more comfortable than this, I assure. The reason this shoe gets 3 stars is craftsmanship. The materials are very nice but the shoe is just WEIRD and doesn't fit well at all. It probably should only get two stars, but I'm feeling generous today. I never want to judge a shoe harshly, since I am a shoe lover, but this shoe is just too hard to love!"
3,The Believers,If you know of Santeria this is a must see although people do not believe but there are forces to be respected and this Movie say's it pretty much how it is.
1,"What happened to the novel, ""The Religion""?","I saw this video and was not really pleased, as I had read the novel, ""The Religion"" and it was so absolutely engrossing in it's content. I had hoped for the same to happen with the movie, as well. I was dissapointed that the book was not followed very well, at all and other than it mentioning the fact, it was a screenplay, based on the novel ""The Religion"", there was not much in the simularity department--now, I would love to find someone who knows anything about locating the novel, as I can no longer find it, anywhere and would love to re-read it, as it is a novel that is perfect, for the person who wants to be kept up all night, just to finish it... if true, as it claims to be. Therefore, the video was not very satisfying, as I had hoped-which surprised me even more, because of having Martin Sheen as the lead in it. I usually like movies that Martin Sheen chooses to do."
3,"2.5, really...","Martin Sheen stars in this almost-scary voodoo flick. The pacing is just a little slow, and they take too long to s...h...o...w... y...o...u... e...v...e...r...y...t...h...i...n...g... in the santeria and brujeria rituals involved. Still, it's an okay horror flick. But to think: later he became President Bartlett!"
1,completely and utterly repugnant,"The ""cult"" featured in this movie is supposed to be Santeria... The trouble is, there are so many liberties taken with the ""facts"" of the religion, it becomes difficult not to come away with a mistaken impression. Firstly, Santeria is hardly a cult...it's members count above 100million, in North and latin America. Secondly, animal sacrifices are performed only sparingly, and the animals sacrificed are usually chickens. There is a huge leap from sacrificing a rooster to sacrificing a small child. (though i am told that they taste approximately the same) thirdly... ah, forget it. i'm not going to list all the inaccuracies. there are dozens, at least. and i only watched the first 20 minutes."
2,Guide to Snoresville,Absolutely boring...my students laughed at some of the suggestions. I just had to return it. My sixth graders would have done a far better job writing this book than the author. It wasn't worth the restocking fee either!
1,What a piece of junk,"First off, I would like to say that the customer service from AMAZON was FANTASTIC. The item, however, does NOT get the same review. I had the PBT-300 for just under a week and it quit working on me. I called Midtronics, was on hold FOREVER with their customer service department, just to be told to send the unit back and they would try to find out what was wrong. I sent it off today and who knows how long they will have it before I hear something about it. We'll see."
1,Guzman Fan,This CD has many of the songs that all Guzman fans look for. However these songs are new version which Guzman re-recorded a few years back and honestly neither his voice nor the new music arrangements are nearly as good as the orginal recordings. Hopefully there are other CDs that have the TRUE original recordings of these timeless classics of Enrique Guzman
3,Intellegence a very short introduction,"This book is a brief review of what is known about the ""science"" of intellegence testing. Evidently, results are not random. People who do well on IQ tests at one time, tend to do well at other times. This is not very helpful.There is not much discussion about what is being measured or what good a high IQ might be. On the controversial issues like race and IQ, the author punts. Perhaps wisely, he doesn't say anything at all.This is a pretty good book in that it reflects that fact that after 100 years of IQ testing not very much of interest is known about the meaning of the test results."
5,"Good new Author, great start","An interesting and well written story of a young man who is left to decipher his heritage through his mothers diaries given to him on his 25th Birthday. Caine is ignorant of his father and his mother died when he wa 5. He grew up safe and wealthy under the care of his Aunt and Uncle, but his birthday brings knowledge and unpleasant surprises. In his mothers will he is left diaries and letters that reveal his father and the evil that has stalked his parents. He must quickly master the powers that his legacy left him to fight this evil and end the threat to his life and revenge his parents. A good book well worth the read. Hopefully we will see another one soon."
3,full body,"My wife absolutely loves them. She says they're back where they belong, her spirits were uplifted only drawback is the excessive sweating, other than that they're perfect."
4,Finally!,"I was looking for a little help. I am naturally a D cup and after age and 5 children, just needed a little help to enhance what I had for special events. These are comfortable, did not slip and helped in the way that I wanted without looking unnatural. They molded to my shape somewhat with body heat and help fill out what time and babies seemed to take from me."
2,Falls Short,"Like every other BMW manual I've seen, this one falls short. There isn't a single one out there that tells you how to take apart the control grips! I wish the manual writers would spend less time talking about repairs that no sane person would attempt (right, I'm gonna disassemble the drive shaft) and more time talking about simple repairs. This manual does describe the disassembly and reassembly of the front fairing (which is a real Chinese puzzle!). On the whole, though, I was not impressed.It's also written for the Brits, which means that most of the terminology is British. Remember what George Bernard Shaw said!"
3,Don't bother,Don't bother to buy a BMW manual. Here's all you need to know:1. Fill the fluids regularly2. Keep the tires inflated3. The clunk on shifting is normal; BMWs use a dry clutch4. The buzzing at 4800 rpm is normal. My friend reminds methat you can buy one part to fix this: it's called a 2001K1200RS!
5,BMW K100 O 75 OWERS WORKSHOP MANUAL,CLAIM CODE XQXS-Z97GNW-PLWB ORDER #002-0520751-7569066/0001-0001
1,Flimsy,"This rod will not hold anything of any substantial weight, unless they are super lightweight cafe curtains. I would send it back, but it's not worth the trouble."
3,It's Only a Pressure Rod,"It works. I have very narrow windows (23"") and didn't want to put any more holes into the walls. Works great for hanging sheers, but I wouldn't put anything heavier than that on it."
2,won't hold more than a lightweight panel or valance,these are very inexpensive and light rods. they are great if you are using them for a light valance or sheers but i put up a medium weight black out curtain and they keep falling down. i'll get better sturdier ones and use these for lightweight panels.
2,too Boad no Size Listed,"This is a good product for the money especially when you have a lot of windows or if you need two for each window, but It was 1/2 too small for what I needed. There was no size listed on the internet so I took a chance. I was able to get some wooden blocks to fill the gaps on all 10 of them but it was kind of a drag."
1,Worked once,"So, does anyone know what is wrong with this toy?We bought the scrub and shine, brand new, tested it, and then put it away for a gift (with batteries removed) for our little one.We gave the destination to our little one, today, and wouldnt' you know, the sounds don't work.It had only been used once before, to test to make sure it worked (which it did). Now, after being in a dry, a/c'd closet, it doesn't work.All it does is turn one red light on when you pass a train through the destination, and the light does not turn off unless you pull the batteries. It does not follow any sequence, and there are no sounds.Has this happened to anyone else?"
5,AeroPress makes a great cup of coffee and is fun to use.,"Makes and excellent cup of coffee. It was also fun to use and cleanup is trivial. One friend saw it, tasted the coffee and immediately ordered one for himself."
4,Good for Espresso or Lattes,"Here's my mini-review of the Aeropress, having just used it for the third time.The coffee is good, seems less bitter than with other methods. Maybe I've just gotten used to bitterness, I'm not sure that's a big improvement -- seems less ""coffee like"" and leaves me wondering if it's strong enough.Main thing is, it uses more coffee beans, like about twice as much. Since my wife insists on expensive beans from Starbucks that matters.The alternative here is those individual drip filters, the kind with the fine metal mesh (no paper filters needed). Put in the grounds, put another piece over them, pour in hot water, put a lid on top, wait a couple of minutes for it to drip through. Works well and fewer parts to deal with.Bottom line: If you're a coffee connoisseur you *might* like the Aeropress better. And it seems perfect if you want an espresso or latte. But for a regular cuppa joe for a regular Joe, save your money."
4,Best cup of coffee ever,"I bought the aeropress a few months ago after it was recommended to me because of the smoothness of the coffee. I am trying to remove refined sugar from my diet and this was my kicker; sugar in my coffee each morning to be able to drink it down. The first cup was so smooth, no bite at all and I haven't missed the sugar since, amazing!"
5,Simple...durable...fantastic,"This is awesome and it makes a dang good cup of coffee or espresso. The version I bought on Amazon came with its own tote for traveling with. Easy to clean, easy to use, portable, and most importantly, it makes a better cup of coffee than my office coffee maker. The plastic is higher quality than that which can be found in most machines, so it doesn't impart any nasty plastic odors from the usage of boiling water. Easy to gauge if you want to make 1 or 2 cups (the lines are on it). I imagine that this could probably be used to brew a nice cup of tea or all sorts of herbal drinks, too. Fantastic, a great buy and great value."
4,Pretty good coffee maker,"I was looking for an inexpensive alternative to an espresso maker. I didn't find it, but the Aeropress makes decent coffee. I like my coffee very hot, so I used hotter water than the directions stipulate (just below the boiling point). It made good regular coffee, but only fair espresso. I was not able to produce any ""crema"" on the coffee. The paper filters filter too well: they remove all sediment even when I use extremely find grind coffee.The coffee maker is easy to use and eash to clean. My Aeropress arrived with one packet of filters included, so you may want to forgo buying another packet until you are sure you like the coffee maker. The manufacturer claims you can wash the filters and reuse them, but I had better results using a new filter each time."
5,Simply the best,"Frankly, it is not a true espresso maker. It will make a great cup of concentrated and regular coffee, however. In my opinion, it does make one of the best cups of coffee I have had. Much cleaner than a french press, and easier to use than a vacuum brew. I use a Technovorm at home with a Rocky grinder. Great combination, by the way. However, I travel often and refuse hotel, gas station and airport coffee. The aeropress has made life on the road much better. It is light, virtually indestructible and easy to use, clean and pack. I have now purchased three in total using several as gifts. For $25,00 every coffee lover should have one."
5,"Makes great coffee, no more machine coffee maker","After using aeropress for several months now, I love how the coffee tastes that come out of it, especially using water boiled to the specified temperature.Totally beats my Brauns coffee maker which I can no longer use because I can now tell base on comparison coffee tastes burned and/or too bitter.After studying espresso, I don't think we can call this ""espresso maker"" but that it makes very dense coffee, if you don't add water. Still love it though."
5,"efficient, easy, great taste.","i've used my Areopress coffee maker for almost four months and love it. i am a construction manager working in Mexico. i am the only one in the trailer that drinks coffee. the Aeropress lets me make a cup of coffee on the spot, enjoy it hot... and the best is that even cold hours later (remember, construction manager!) the quality of the coffee is still outstanding, it retains its flavor.i use the hot water from the hot/cold water machine. the temperature is just right. the cleanup is very easy, i open the trailer door, rinse the filter with water from the plunger turned upside down, reinstall the filter and i'm ready for the next cup. in four months i'm on my third filter (1-2 cups per day). Efficient, easy and great tasting coffee. for my work lifestyle its perfect....and did i mention great tasting coffee?"
5,aeorobie means good coffee,Easy to use and using it makes it easy to make good coffee easily.I own two. One for home and one for work.
4,Makes good coffee,Bought this to give it a try as I was getting tired of the French press. To tell you how much we liked it the evening it arrived we made a cup to try it out and ended up making 4 more the coffee tasted so good. Per the instructions fill water up to the #2 level for rich espresso like coffee then just add hot water for a larger cup of smooth flavorful coffee. I have quit adding sugar and milk to my coffee because I have been enjoying it so much.It takes a little bit to get the hang of pressing the coffee down and the pressure build up can make it feel hard to press down. This might have to do with how fine we grind our beans. But work with it and you will figure out the technique.For $20+ this is hard to beat.
4,"Simple, Works and a nice cup of Coffee","This is a wonderful device that took me by surprise. It is easy to use and to clean....best yet, it creates a good cup of espresso-like coffee or Americano with hot water added. Do keep in mind, the quality of your cup will depend on the use of coffee bean and water. Lastly, you do need to use a bit of beans to create a good cup of coffee. It's worth it in my opinion. Who needs Starbucks?"
5,"Less Money, Better Coffee!","I am in love with my Aeropress. I am a Seattleite and therefore inherently a coffee snob. My poison of choice is an Americano with a hint of chocolate syrup (espresso purists commence judging me now). In any case, the Aeropress makes even crappy, preground coffee taste good and makes fresh ground espresso beans taste divine. I now feel guilty buying cofffee out because I know that I could make it better and cheaper at home. Thank you to Aerobie for making this device and Amazon for making it conveniently available! Yay for caffeine!"
5,AeroPress - 2 years later,"I've been using these at home, in our camper, and on vacations. The coffee is great - very consistent and easily tailored to individual taste. I've recommended these to friends and family and have probably sold a dozen people on the method.The only down side has been that the cylinder can develope small vertical cracks over time, however, I called Aerobie and they sent me a replacement for free.Also, on cold mornings the plunger sometimes won't make a good seal. Just preheat the plunger with some warm water and it works every time."
2,No advantage over a French Press - just messier and complicated,"I've had a french press for 10 years, works great. I saw the high reviews of this product and though it must be simpler, especially for just one cup. I was wrong, there are lots of different parts, you need a new filter for each press and its messy.There is no reason coffee would be better than a normal press.Mines going to the back of the cupboard."
3,Makes good coffee but...,"1) it's pricey for what it is and2) it uses A LOT of coffee.I think a moka pot and french press are better option. Both cost less and use less coffee, albeit takes a few minutes longer to make and has a little more clean up involved."
4,Nifty little gadget,"I'm still getting used to this little guy. It does go through the beans though. That's the only thing. The scoop is 3 tablespoons, and the recommendation is to use two scoops to make one 10 oz. cup of coffee. I use Peet's ""Major Dickeson's Blend"" and it's very smooth and delicious. But using 6 tablespoons of beans per cup gets kinda pricey. I'm still fine tuning the grind and temperature combination, but so far I do like the coffee. I would recommend this to anybody who likes Americano style coffee. Not sure it's exactly like an espresso drink, but if it tastes good, then who cares, right?"
4,yumm,"this thing is sweet. the flavor of the coffee really comes through well. fast and easy to use, fun! def. recommended"
2,Not what I thought...,"High grade coffee + excellent roasters = deliciously flavored coffee with beautifully thick crema.The aeropress and its paper filter remove all of the oils (flavors) from my amazing coffee and reduced it to coffee flavored water.If you buy coffee off the shelf at the grocery store, the aeropress will improve on the flavor by removing the bitter oils.If you love coffee and seek out good coffee, don't buy an aeropress."
1,WEAK Coffee - Better BIALETTI Stovetop,"WEAK COFFEE ...I've used this for over a year, checking all of the reviews and online videos, but the coffee comes out TOO WEAK for my taste. I've resorted to leaving the plunger in the top of the funnel to let it sit and steep like tea (to make it stronger) and I've even tried different coffees and grinds ... but that's defeating the purpose of 1 cup coffee convenience.It's better for use in traveling, etc as long as you have a source for hot water.For Coffee at Home, I've gone back to my Bialetti Stovetop from ITALY (do NOT get the import from China or India).Just make sure that you get the right size. These cups are the small expresso size measure. Bialetti 12 cup is actually 2 American coffee mugs.AeroPress is a waste of money.Bialetti Moka Express 12-Cup Stovetop Espresso MakerBialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso MakerBialetti Venus, 6 CupCaffe Kimbo Kimbo Tasters Trio Pack - 3 Ground Espresso Packs"
4,"Great, Easy Coffee",I now see why so many people love this coffee maker. It's very easy to make great coffee with this. The result is a super smooth cup. I'd been using either a French Press or Espresso Pot for months and wasn't pleased with the results. The Aerobie makes a great cup every time.
5,Best coffee maker....ever!,I love coffee! I probably drink too much coffee! I am very particular about my coffee! The AeroPress makes the best cup of coffee I have ever made at home. It is a little more work than you may used to initially but once you get the nack of it it is so simple. The quality is also very consistent from cup to cup. Buy it you will not be sorry.
5,Makes great coffee! Is portable and easy to use!,"I received this as a gift in 2009 and I absolutely love it! I use it all the time. I own a nice drip coffee pot, but my husband doesn't drink coffee, so I find myself using this more and more so that I don't end up wasting halfa pot. I also own a Krups espresso maker, but I haven't used it once since I got the Aeropress.It's also easy to travel with. I've taken it with me on trips when I know that the people I'm staying with don't drink coffee. It's nice not to have to worry about breakage like you would with a glass French Press.I bought one for my Mom and she loves hers too :) If you are a fan of a good Americano I'd definitely give the Aeropress a try."
5,need an electric kettle,"Makes great coffee, I highly recommend the Adagio Variable Temperature Electric Kettle to go with it, is the missing link for morning coffee."
4,no zippered nylon bag??,"I'm a HUGE fan of my Aeropress! I make myself a coffee with it almost every day and make coffee for friends with it all the time. Just bought one as a gift for a friend and when it arrived...I was disappointed to see that it didn't come with a zippered bag like mine has. Unfortunately it's a gift and it has to be ready to give before I could get another one shipped to me.The zippered bag is inexpensive but mine has held up well enough. I use it when I take my press with me. I don't travel with the funnel or the stirrer... If I didn't have a zippered bag I would be shopping for a bag to go with it.It looks like some of the Aeropresses on Amazon DO come with a zippered bag and some do not. I assumed they all would. If you think you'll take your Aeropress with you, to work, to school, or camping, you'll probably appreciate having a bag to go with it."
3,Good results but too much trouble for my taste...,"I bought this three years ago with the intention of using at work - the only time I really need one cup at a time. It made a good cup of coffee, but was just too much of a hassle with the paper filters and messy clean up. I used it off and on for a few months and then it sat in my desk drawer until I left my job. Then it sat in my kitchen for another year and then I gave it away. Neat gadget, but just not for me!"
2,its just ok..so so...,"people are right, the plastic aeropress, cannot make great cofi...it holds back the natural oils...giving u sterile cofi... only..not much FUN cofi at all...not recommended...unlessu want to take the strong fun out of espresso, etc..here is another idea...USE a tiny SHARP PINto make the necessary HOLES into the wet paper filter !this works to give u a hybrid tasteof aeropress vs, french pressand can be better for you toogive it a try...have fun"
2,Don't waste your money!,"Nothing is wrong with the quality and construction - just fine.The problems comes with the claims in the ads - - the truth is: there is nothing better about this brewing method than the normal drip method. A standard Melita drip filter yields a cup of coffee that is indistiguishable from the Aerobie AeroPress.The only small advantage for the AeroPress is that it is able to produce a single cup of coffee a bit quicker than a drip pot - but only a single cup, not a mug!Save your money and buy some high quality coffee instead of this product and use your old drip pot."
1,Overpriced POS,"My first review at AmazonI use this service for few years and ussualy pretty satisfied with things I purhased hereThis piece of Junk - exeptionCoffee taste terrible, nothing even close to Expresso.It takes to much time and effort to prepare itIt takes 2 mugs/cans/glassesThen cleaningThen .... brown liquid - not coffee"
2,vastly overrated,The Aeropress is vastly overrated. The coffee produced is similar to instant coffee in flavor. It uses a lot of beans and simply misses the subtle flavors and body a good cup of coffee needs. I have returned to my MR Coffee for a good brew.
5,So long bitter coffee,"I purchased this product a month ago purely based on what other had said and I have to say that it is all true. If you think the coffee you make at home tastes bitter or signifigantly worse than Starbucks, buy this contraption, the coffee is good."
4,It makes good coffee,"I'm not sure I'm willing to call it good espresso, but it's sure better than the coffee the little machine in the hotel room makes. It's kind of a cross between a French press and an espresso machine. The cleanup is simple and it packs nicely so I'll be taking it with me anywhere I go."
5,"""Does what it's supposed to. I was amazed!""","I wanted this for one reason--to get the highest caffeinated coffee I could make. In short, it gave me real 'shots' from ordinary coffee! You get a 'lifetime' supply of filters, because they are easily cleaned and reusable. The unit is tightly built and simple in design. For this price, I can't find anything to complain about. It does just what it's supposed to do."
5,Been using this for almost two years,"Makes the best single cup of coffee, for anyone who doesnt mind a little effort to make it. The plunger extracts more caffeiene and oils from the grounds to make coffee much richer and fuller than drip."
5,great coffee maker,"I've had this for a couple of weeks now. Consistently produces a rich, non-bitter, cup of coffee. Clean-up is really quick and easy. It took a little while of experimentation fine tune the process. I think my coffee does taste better when brewed at the lower temperature (175). I like that I can adjust the strength by adding hot water to the coffee concentrate that the aero press produces. You kind of have to do this else the coffee is too cold for my taste. That's one of the downsides. The only other downside is that it uses lots of coffee. I don't mind because I'd rather have one good cup than the 2 bad ones I used to get from my Mr. Coffee."
5,Great product,"The aero press is a fast way to make great coffee or espresso. It makes very strong coffee. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hates burned machine coffee, but doesn't have time for the french press."
5,Best Single Coffee Maker Ever,"My son had one of these for about a year and one morning I was the only one up so decided use his aeropress. Placed measured coffee in the tube, filled with hot water from the Sunbeam Hotshot we also got from Amazon. Stir and by the time the filter is locked on the press, it is ready to invert and press what is essentially an espresso strength shot of coffee into the cup. Topped with rest of hot water to taste and add some sugar and cream... WOW. Fresh, not acidic, and very smooth. This will be my way of making coffee if not needed several at once.With the price of coffee today, this is an excellent value and probably pay for it's initial cost in coffee not wasted."
5,"Great, easy coffee","Highly recommended. Compact (perfect for a smaller apartment like mine), makes great coffee with minimal fuss. I needed something that would allow me to have only a tea kettle on the counter/stove (coffee makers take up a lot of space), and this works beautifully. I reclaimed a lot of counter space, I have a tea kettle that takes up *much* less space and that I can use both for my coffee and for my oatmeal (or my fiancee's tea, or whatever else), and I still get my morning cup o'caffeinated goodness. A definite winner."
5,Great product!,Bought this for my adult grandson-in-law and he absolutely loves it. I justhad some coffee made with this product last week and it was outstanding.
2,Did not work for me...,"I have to agree with the others who gave this low marks. This device is too Mickey Mouse. It uses too much coffee, the water immediately started flowing through the filter the moment I poured it in giving me little time to stir much less push the plunger in, the water temperature was not hot enough, and in the end just too fiddly.This device would work much better with a U-bend somewhere in it so the water does not flow through right away and would give the user time to give a good push through. Overall a disappointment for me and I returned it."
5,The Best Purchase Ever,I'm a coffee snob... This makes even cheap crappy coffee taste delicious and with a little practice I can whip out a delicious cup of coffee in no time. Highly recommended for the true coffee connoisseur.
4,Flavorful,"Though I still prefer the stronger flavor and better mouthfeel of French Press coffee, this device works as advertised. I have not noticed any dulling or cloudiness to the plastic like I've seen mentioned in some reviews. Handwash only.Grind your beans the night before (you really do need a burr mill grinder for consistent grind) and toss some water in the microwave, and this only takes slightly more effort in the morning than a automatic drip machine. After you press the water through directly into your cup, you're left with a near solid puck of compressed grounds. Just pop it into the trash and rinse the plunger and cylinder in the sink, and away you go."
4,Simple machine - good coffee,"It makes a decent cup of espresso for such a simple device. The construction is solid and the finishing seems good.Have enjoyed the coffee it makes so far. A manual explaining how to get the most out the Aeropress would help, but there's plenty of help online."
1,ho hum,Another slick nothing product cafe does not taste any better.....hassle to have another junk plastic in the cupboard the inventor should stick to toys and leave the real work to the men
1,weak coffee,"I read a lot of reviews before i bought this and i feel like I've been scammed. this thing makes super weak coffee. my keureg makes better coffee than this thing, I'm gonna buy a french press now since this thing is a big disappointment."
1,terrible taste,"like all other 1 star review, the ease of use and no electricity needed just aren't enough for me to drink a bad cup of coffee everytime I brew a cup.....I've bought grounds from stores where I've had the same, and alas once I brew it in this system, the taste is day & night.if you care about the taste, don't get this one. I am going to try Keurig B60 next....."
1,Go with A Regular Coffee Press,"This is an accident waiting to happen....go with a coffee press. And to all those who love this product, good for you, I don't, and I don't need your nasty feedback."
1,"Cool, but **NOT** a good coffee maker!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I am a little confused by this item's descriptions and some of the reviews. Let me make one thing clear: THIS IS NOT A GOOD MACHINE FOR HIGH QUALITY ESPRESSO! If you want the most bang for your buck for espresso, pay another $115 and get the MyPressi which makes espresso rivalling the thousand dollar machines with good crema, etc. they way it is supposed to be.... so that leaves the evaluation as a coffee maker.... THIS IS NOT AS GOOD AS A FRENCH PRESS FOR MAKING COFFEE. 1) It only makes a partial concentrated cup that you have to dilute with additional hot water to get ONE (YES 1 MAX) cup of coffee. This is more of a gimmick than anything. Any french press will make better coffee and MORE of it. I did not expect a plastic toy when I ordered this."
5,Aeropress Espresso Maker,"A great concept that works as advertised. Not strictly espresso, but very close. Easy to use and clean. I just wish there was a larger version for multiple cups."
5,Best coffee makert ever....,"The very best coffee. Easy to use, easy to clean up. Great control over how the coffee comes out (espresso strong to colored water weak) Its up to you. And since it is by the cup every body gets there's like they like it."
4,Great coffee but not durable,"I bought two of these, so i could make more than one cup at a time; we loved the coffee. I like very strong coffee, and these made the cleanest strong coffee I ever had. But after 12 months, the plungers are worn out and loose. There is no option to order new plungers. They are inexpensive, but even at $25 each seems like they should last more than a year. So i have switched to a Chemex pot, will see how we like that coffee.Update - the Chemex pot just does not make strong enough coffee, i am back to the french press . . ."
5,So many ways to make coffee with this!,"I love the versatility of this gizzmo. I usually use the inverted method, which is like having a french press that filters through paper. You get a full flavor extraction without the sediment. I don't really care for the taste of the traditional way of making an americano with the aeropress as it tastes a little flat to me. But it's great if I want a cappuccino. So much better than going to a Starbucks."
3,makes good coffee - but requires a lot of pressure to push down,"This coffee press makes a nice cup of coffee (once you figure out he right combination of coffee and water that gives you the taste you like). However it does require a lot of force to push the plunger down. Most people will be able to do this, but anyone with decreased function in their arms or hands will not be able to use this."
3,"Not espresso at all, but some of the smoothest coffee I've tasted.","I received this today and have used it a couple of times.It absolutely doesn't make espresso, no crema. The drink itmakes is fabulous. Can't wait for the next one.You have to like the ""ritual of alchemy"" with the Aerobie. Ittakes considerably longer to get ready than an espresso machine.There are several parts to this item but I personally like themachinations. So, I will use it alot.Not shown in the ad is that it has a little counter top holder forthe filters and a stand to store the press on while not in use.I would recommend but do not expect to get espresso from this."
4,Makes great coffee but with some difficulty,"I like the product and how it makes a much better coffee than my French press - it tastes smoother, and works well if you want to dilute the concentrate and make a latte. The only problem I have with it is really something I don't see mentioned in the other reviews (which also makes me wonder if I'm using the product right). The problem I have is that I find it really hard to screw in the filter cap. If I don't get it screwed all the way in then all the water falls through the filter into my cup before I have even have time to stir. It's easy to screw the cap in about 75% of the way and the remaining 25% is a real struggle. So if you have superior grip strength (or I'm overlooking something obvious), this might not be a problem."
5,Excellent coffee in small amounts,I received this for Christmas and it makes the best cup of coffee I've ever made at home. Typically I only drink a single cup from a French press so this fit my needs perfectly. It is super easy to use and clean (by far easier to clean than a traditional French press). If you want a great cup of coffee then this is the press for you.
3,Amount of Coffee?,"I really enjoy the coffee/expresso this makes... everything said it the reviews is right on. It is a bit of a process to use (getting water to right temp, the pressure to push it through, etc).I don't believe anyone has mentioned it yet, but is it just me or does this require an extraordinary amount of coffee?? Granted I do like mine strong, so use a few shots... but 1 scoop for the aeropress is equal to 2 scoops in a coffee maker. Making a 3 shot cup uses just as many grinds as a half a pot of regular coffee. Tends to add up if you use expensive coffee."
3,It's fine,"I don't understand why people are so crazy about this thing. With a little trial and error, you can brew a pretty good cup of coffee (use an ultra-fine grind).Pluses:-brew in less than a minute-minimal clean up-good for campingMinuses:-doesn't taste nearly as good as a french press if you like a full-bodied, unfiltered coffee-plastic-not as relaxing as a french press-it sort of begs for an immediate clean-up"
5,My go-to coffee solution...,"I ordered this little guy in 2009. Originally, I bought it for camping, since it's durable plastic and just requires some boiled water. However, it quickly became my primary coffee making tool. I've been doing the ""inversion method"" for the past year or so, flipping it on the handle and letting the coffee steep longer. I also get two uses per day out of each filter, just rinsing it out in between. If you know someone with an Aeropress, ask for a sample. You'll quickly learn why this is what the Starbucks CEO uses to make the ""best cup of coffee known to mankind"".I just wanted to add a review here, because I have an old Aeropress with the clear plastic (don't know why some are now darker), and I have never experienced any of the ""spidering"" that somebody posted a picture of. I pour water straight from the kettle (just after boiling) into the Aeropress, and haven't seen any hint of this. Buy and enjoy with confidence."
5,Coffee Lovers greatest gadget!,I bought this for my husband around Christmas.He absolutely loves it.
4,I would definitely buy it again.,Bought this product because of the overwhelming positive reviews. Ditto. Would definitely buy it again. It makes an excellent cup of coffee WITH SOME EXPERIMENTATION. I like strong coffee and found a finer grind mandatory.It also took some testing to find the proper ratio of water to coffee. But with a little patience you will find a brew that your taste buds will really enjoy. It does take several times through the process to make it reasonably time efficient. I like to clean it after each use to remove the oil residue. That can be quite simply accomplished with a cup of hot soapy water a a clean paper towel. It travels easily and I intend to always have one available. I gave it 4 stars only because getting to a five star cup of coffee was not automatic but took some time to experiment.
5,Wow... Great coffee,I'm impressed. The AeroPress is simple to use and makes great coffee. It produces a very smooth cup of joe with regular ground coffee and I can't wait to try it with some real espresso.
5,"Quick, convenient, portable... oh yeah, and BEST COFFEE EVER","I use this (and a small electric kettle) at work to produce Americano style coffee. This is absolutely the best kind--using a ceramic mug also means it doesn't taste like paper cup from the coffee shop. As an added bonus, when brewing flavored coffees, the flavors come through much more clearly, instead of fighting with the drip-brew flavors. The press is also fairly small, which makes it convenient for travel."
5,A simple way to make AMAZING coffee at home!,"Yup, Aerobie, the people that make High Performance Sport Toys are dabbling in coffee science... and what a dabble it was! I just made my first cup, and it is AMAZING! Easy to use and clean, it's faster than an espresso or drip machine, and the flavor is full and robust. 20 seconds from pouring the boiling water to an amazing cup of coffee. Seriously, it's friggin sweet! I highly recommend using filtered or distilled water for the most robust flavor. It really does make a diference!"
3,Unable to find parts,"Like the Aeropress, makes good coffee. Haven't had it that long when I lost the filter cap and am unable to find anywhere to get one. Found a place in California online, wrote an email a few days ago, no answer yet. Without the filter cap I am unable to use the Aeropress, they should have some customer support somewhere."
2,The coffee is fine but. . .,"The coffee is fine but it is not worth the hassle. I was on the quest for the best cup of coffee to start my day. I heard someone raving about this maker and said I should give a try. I even bought the extra filters planning and hoping for the best. Results were disappointing. It is a cumbersome process for such a small amount of finished coffee. Boiling water, filter, stirring, pressing into a cup, adding more water, clean up rinse repeat. By the time I made a mug for my wife and I it just wasn't worth it. I ended my quest when I found a Saeco coffee maker with the thermal carafe. Life is good and so is my coffee. Grind, add water and enjoy!"
2,Cannot make crema,"The other reviews were right on....it is very hard to clean for just one cup of coffee. I have tried to create crema and no matter how hard I push (the filter will only allow it to flow so fast), I have not been able to get any crema. I detected no difference from a coffee press in favor and they are way easier to clean. So, in my opinion, it does not work any better than a cheap coffee press, which can be purchased for @ $6.00, but cost 5 times as much....I would not have purchased, given what I now know."
3,So-so coffee,"I bought this product because of the wonderful reviews I read about it. So far, I haven't been able to make the espresso/americano described by the reviews. I am sure I am following the directions exactly. I am using Starbucks Pike Market coffee beans too."
1,AeroPress Coffee Maker,"Low quality for too high price very disappointed, must return you should reconsider offering this product, it is not a good value."
3,novelty,A regular coffee press is much better. Careful when you press it cause it tips the coffee cup. Not dangerous just messy.
3,"Nice, but just nice (not excellent)","I think this product is over rated and over priced, although the coffee it made taste decent, but the material it used really does not worth $26.Compared to normal French press or Espresso machine, the coffee it produced is ""flat"", I think it has a lot to do with the paper filter it used. I think at the price they charged for this product it should at least include a permanent filter (stainless plate with arrays of finely drilled holes).With the combo as it is right now, I think it is only OK, definitely not a great bargain."
2,weak,stick to a french press if you want good coffee. I've tried 10 cups now and they all lack the taste from the french press i accidentially broke.
5,What a great cup of coffee,"I waited till I had a few months with this baby before I wrote a review.. All I can say is *WOW*. I got tired of the sludge of a French Press, breaking vacuum pots, and the terrible taste of automatic coffee makers. This is a dream for the 1-3 cup coffee maker. Easy to make coffee, easy to clean up, and a great cup of coffee. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good cup of coffee for sure."
5,Great coffee maker; easy cleanup,"I wanted a coffee maker for my office, because I don't like the cheap stuff brewed in our break room. However, I also didn't want something that required constant cleaning. This coffee maker is super easy to use (add water, stir, push plunger) and clean (rinse filter holder and plunger), and it makes a great cup of coffee."
5,Awsome,"This is the best coffee purchase I have ever made, and I have made a lot of them over the years. It makes an unbelievable cup of coffee in just a few minutes."
5,Perfect!,"For the price paid, this is a perfect product -- sturdy with nice finish and extremely easy to clean. The product also ships with an adapter in case you don't have a jar or mug that can accommodate the wide base of the AeroPress. The micro-filters that's also provided should keep you enjoying a good cup of coffee every morning and evening for a long time. I woudn't hesitate to recommend this product to any coffee lover!"
5,Great little contraption,"I think that this is a great alternative to bulky espresso machines. I must warn readers though, I'm not a coffee connoisseur. I do like espresso drinks and can easily use this every day to make a latte in just a few minutes. I use our Nespreso milk frother with it and they make a great combination. This Aeropress has a super small footprint takes up the same space as a pint glass in our cupboard. It's easy to use and easy to clean and makes decent coffee. I would definitely recommend giving it a try."
4,Easy to use,"I'm a complete coffee novice. I've only recently developed a taste for it and decided I needed something to make coffee at home, rather than pay high coffee house prices. I didn't want anything that would clog up my limited kitchen space and something easy to use. I had read a lot and asked a bunch of my coffee drinking friends for ideas. In the end I decided on the AeroPress. I'm super glad I did.The AeroPress doesn't take up any counter space, when I'm finished I can put it in a drawer out of sight. It is easy to use, although it did take me some time to perfect the use of it. The thing to remember is that this makes shots of coffee/espresso that need to be added to either more hot water or milk before drinking. I started out making my coffee much too week. The directions included explain this better than I can, but once you get it figured out, it is fantastic.Clean up is super easy. Rinse everything off, wipe off the plunger and let it air dry."
5,Coffee Cup Cheers!,"If you want to make the best tasting coffee at home that truly brings out all the flavor in your coffee beans, you have to try the AeroPress! Just got one the other day & all I can say is OMG!Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker"
5,"Best cup of coffee yet,","Best cup of home brewed coffee yet. Way better than my french press, and absolutely no grinds got into my cup (a pet peeve of mine with french pressing). I also got a hario hand grinder which may have made a difference. Cleanup is a snap, little final push and the puck of coffee just goes right into the recycle. PRO TIP: run hot water through your filter before pressing as it removes a bit of the acidic filter taste."
5,Great coffee maker!,"One of the best coffee makers ever! Simple to use, easy to clean up and the coffee it produces is divine - complete with creama... Easy to pack & very portable - it goes everywhere with us."
4,Not true espresso but....,"First of all this is not an espresso maker; it's a glorified french press. Espresso is not just coffee made very strong, which is what you get when you use this. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It produces great coffee as any press would when you use quality beans and filtered water, but it's a little misleading to call this an espresso maker. When I make espresso it has about 1/2 inch of crema floating on it. No crema, no espresso."
4,Best single cup coffee maker too bad is not automatic.,"I bought the Aeropress because the reviews were so good. Took me about three tries to make a good cup of coffee. It makes the best coffee.I even ran out of filters and ended up cutting my own from other coffee maker filters.The ONLY problem I have with this coffee maker is that I am too lazy to make coffee ""handcrafted"" in the morning upon awaken. Otherwise it is excellent.You can even take it with you camping or traveling."
4,"Makes good tasting coffee, but uses a lot of grounds","The coffee this thing makes is quite tasty, and generally better than any drip coffee maker. However, it uses a lot of grounds so is less efficient in that respect. I like that you can easily vary the strength of the coffee by adding more or less hot water without sacrificing the good deep flavor. It's well designed, seems sturdy, and the filters are reusable (for a few times), so one does save on filter costs. It's also faster than drip machines or pouring your own drip. I recommend it if you're searching for a richer alternative to yucky drip coffee taste."
5,Great coffee maker.,"Excellent product, reasonable price and you won't find a better coffee maker; I use it every day now instead of my drip machine. I know what I'm giving to my coffee loving friends for Christmas."
5,Make a very smooth cup of coffee,I bought the AeroPress a few years ago and enjoyed it on and off for a few months. After that I switched to a french press and drip machine. Today I made a cup of joe with the AeroPress and remembered what an amazing job it does. The coffee comes out good even if I don't get the water temperature perfect. I'm switching back to using it for my morning coffee.
4,Needs larger capacity!!!,"This is a great device that makes fantastic smooth coffee (once you get the proportions right). It is great for the office or home. My only real complaint is that the capacity on it is so low. After pressing out one test tube of coffee, it barely fills my small or medium size cups. I would love it if they came out with a higher capacity aeropress. I would buy it in a second."
5,great little coffee maker,great little coffee maker. just like an inverted french press. perfect for traveling as it is light weight & used grounds are easy to dispose. doesn't make real espresso but it does make a very smooth cup o'joe.
5,very good!,"I am very satisfied with this product...it is just as it is advertised...the coffee is perfect, not bitter, very little clean up...i love it!"
5,Brilliant little product !,"One of the most well-designed 'gadgets' ever. Easy to use, with exceptional attention paid to ""ease of use"" additions, i.e. the funnel and the stirrer.Makes great coffee. Works well even without espresso grind [used french press grind to test] - made great cup of coffee, better than the cheaper espresso blend I bought next.Easiest cleanup of all coffee-makers.Highest praise to the inventor who came up with this.Hope the seal lasts.[Where to get a replacement seal ?]"
4,One cup wonder,"I'm a coffee snob. I own many types of coffee makers from a Melitta filter holder to a high end Italian espresso machine. The Aeropress is great because of its simplicity. It doesn't really make true espresso but a near-espresso concentrate to which you simply add your hot water to taste. It couldn't be easier to use or clean (much neater than my French press), great for travel and camping and even backpacking. The only reason I didn't give five stars is that it requires a fair amount of pressure and some practice to minimize that. If you follow their 20-30 second recommendation it turns out to be a good rate to minimize the amount of pressure and strength required. I haven't broken a mug yet but it goes through my mind when I'm plunging the press. All that said I love it, have bought them as gifts, recommend it highly and use mine often. It won't replace an espresso machine but for a great tasting easy to make cup of coffee you can't go wrong for the 25 bucks."
5,Great,"I've been using the Aeropress for almost a year now. I started with typical drip coffee, and it always had the ""homemade"" taste, but not in the good way. I bought my girlfriend an espresso machine and neither of us liked it too much. It was a pain to use and a pain to clean.Since then I bought the Aeropress for myself. My only complaint is that I now have to buy milk almost twice as often because I drink so many lattes. It's easy to use and couldn't be easier to clean.Have also used it camping for a nice morning cup of joe."
3,"Good coffee, but not superior","The coffee is good, but I wouldn't say superior to traditional presses. Nor does the AeroPress'ed coffee remind me of true espresso.What I find most unappealing, though, is the seven or so pieces I have to manage each time I want a brew. I prefer the simplicity of traditional presses. The resultant coffee did not justify the extra effort required to make it.I do not find the plunger difficult to push, like some other users have noted."
5,Makes an AMAZING cup of coffee!,"A friend recommended this and my first thought was that it is a bit expensive for a one cup coffee maker. But, I indulged and it is worth the $$ and more! It is VERY simple to brew up to 4 shots of espresso at one time. This equates to two large americanos (2 large cups of really good coffee). You just brew and add some hot water to your cup. The only issue is getting the water temp right. It only affects flavor, so you always get a cup of joe. The temp just affects the taste.One thing I did notice is that as this brings out the flavor of your coffee, it accentuates the bad taste of bad coffee. NEVER use this with Folgers, etc. I was out of my usual dark roast, fair trade, organic recycled packaging make the world a better place by drinking coffee joe and found some Folgers left over from a visitor. YUCK! I threw it away and made a cup of tea!"
5,Aeropress,"For one person with a inexpensive grinder this is the way to go, I found it makes good coffee with a Melitta Grinder & 8 o'clock Columbian. With a good grinder & fresh home roast I prefer a French Press. I use the Aeropress to make a concentrated brew for my morning protein drink. I consider the Aeropress essential in my brewing arsenal which includes a French Press, Bialetti Brikka,& Bodum Bistro Drip Pot. The Aeropress is good for lattes & cafe Americanos but it doesn't make decent espresso for drinking straight up, get a Mocha Pot for that. Gave this 5 stars because of the excellent accessories provided, the funnel,scoop, stirring paddle, & excellent quality even though their espresso claims are extravagant."
5,Coffee snob: Happy at school/work,"I bought the AeroPress for use at my MBA program to bypass the overpriced coffee from the shop with long lines. The coffee is excellent, and that is coming from a complete coffee snob; I will face withdrawal symptoms rather than drink crap coffee.I keep my AeroPress in my locker in a little bag and use water from the electric kettle in the break room. The accessories, coffee, and extra filters fit inside the small bag easilly. I actually rinse and reuse the filters many times; I have been using the same one for about two weeks now.I love the little device and am going to order another to leave at home. I am going to put my thermos Cuisinart with grinder and timer in the garage, and just keep an electric kettle and AeroPress for all of my coffee needs. It is actually faster and easier than traditional methods, with better outputs."
5,"Super fast, super easy, really decent espresso","Takes less than 60 seconds to setup, fill with coffee & hot water (I have a water cooler that also dispenses hot water, so no time to heat), brew/stir 10 seconds, & press out a really decent cup of espresso (even with regular store-bought coffee). Probably another 60 seconds to empty the grounds and rinse clean. Can't beat this device for cost, ease of use/cleaning, quality of results."
2,For espresso - not coffee,"we're used to french roast coffee - very finely ground - using a cone filter. to get it strong enough, we use around 100-120 ml per 10 cups. the coffee scoop that aerobie includes in this package is huge -- 40 ml for a single espresso (or to get a 5oz coffee, you add hot water to the single espresso) ! the amount of grounds that you have to use is probably about right if you're looking for espresso, but as a coffee maker, it wastes a LOT - four times the amount of grounds that you're used to."
3,"Coffee, yes - espresso, no","I am pleased with this product since I mainly wanted the ability to make a fast, strong cup or two of coffee. That being said, I do not think it replaces my pump espresso machine by any means and it is strictly for small quantities; if I want more than 2 cups, it would be easier to use my Cuisinart coffeemaker. Three stars because the coffee is excellent but no more since it really doesn't have the espresso result. Easy to use and clean."
3,Great but doesn't last long.,"I'm on this page to buy my third AeroPress since Christmas. If you make like nine shots a day, you'll need to buy three AeroPresses a year.I love the coffee, the ease of cleaning and the space saving. But I wish the makers would use a more heat-resistant plastic, because hairline cracks form in the cylinder making it wider and thereby weakening the vacuum and the seal of the plunger."
3,No big deal.,"The Aeropress is touted as a really neat coffee system. My experience is that it produces an acceptable, but not outstanding cup of coffee. Espresso is it not. It is very finicky about water temperature and proportions of coffee to water, and it's very easy to over-extract. I am yet to find the grind that results in ""espresso"", an espresso grind seems to be too coarse. The system comes with a double coffee scoop, filters, funnel, top and bottom parts, and a paddle for stirring, and the price is right. If I couldn't use a stovetop espresso maker, the AeorPress would be better than pot coffee, but not by much. A double-strength pot coffee is more satisfying to my pallet than this system, a machiato brews a stronger, more full bodied drink, and a steam powered espresso machine makes a uniquely superior cup. But when I'm on the road and only have access to a microwave, this little gadget makes a drinkable small cup of coffee."
4,"Good Coffee, but . . .","It makes a good french press type cup of coffee. I've owned a couple of french press machines and have found the coffee was too strong for my taste. Aeropress makes a milder cup of coffee than the french press machines I've used. It's easy to set up and clean. But, it does use quite a bit of coffee to make a cup of coffee.With all of the gadgets I've purchased, big and small espresso machines, french press(es), coffee bean cookers, I still am inclined to use our Bunn coffee maker and grind Starbucks Verona coffee. It's easy, good cup of coffee. But, if you are looking for a toy, or if you drink a single cup of coffee once or twice a day, this is the machine I would get."
1,"Absolutely no different than a french press, possibly even worse.","This device is seriously overhyped. The coffee it make is absolutely no different than a french press, except with a french press the coffee has longer to steep. The aeropress doesn't even need to be plunged, it's basically a drip system if you leave it long enough. The final press does get you a little strong squirt at the end but made nearly no difference in the taste or bitterness. Additionally, it holds hardly any water, a french press holds plenty of water, makes several cups. I made several cups using aeropress, french press and coffee maker. I dislike coffee makers in general or any drip coffee, and the aeropress tasted just like the coffee maker.I would return this item if I hadn't already used it, you don't return something like that. I'll not be using it though, and is a regrettable purchase."
2,AeroPress,"Not much better than a French press but a lot bigger and with more pieces. The minute grains do not get through the filter but that is a disappointment in espresso. The espresso quantities required to make a small double would consume a week's paycheck! Well, I exagerate, but I do better in other espresso gadgets. And coffee in a percolator tastes much better."
2,Mediocre Espresso,This is a great maker for American coffee drinkers who have the occasional espresso. This will not pass for a full-time espresso drinker. The machine functions fine but the coffee is not robust enough to be called true espresso.
2,Not what I expected.,Well I read all the reviews for this product and decided to purchase it. After I opened the box and looked at it the quality was really bad. Well I might be a little harsh but it just wasn't for me. It was way too small and the coffee didn't taste good. It just don't think it's worth it when you can buy one that holds the coffee in it for a while when boiling it. This releases all the flavor out and doesn't taste like watered down coffee. I returned and bought a $25-30 one and I love it.
2,If you like arm-wrestling . . .,"Makes a nice smooth shot of espresso - but at the price of a sweaty arm-wrestling match combined with a chemistry lab experiment. You have to buy a digital thermometer, get the water temperature just right (not an easy feat, regardless of how you go about it), and then wrestle the plunger down, which takes closer to two minutes than the 20 seconds in the instruction guide, the darn rubber gasket is so tight. Which means the espresso is more bitter than it should be, due to the water sitting in it so long while you wreck your arm trying to get the plunger to go down without knocking the coffee cup over. I'm honestly surprised by all the good reviews here - it might be cheap, and if you can get it work right the coffee is good, but this is not an easy unit to use."
4,It's a good coffee maker,"Pros:Since it makes an espresso first, it increases the variety of drinks you can makeCoffee tastes goodCons:Far more work to make a coffee compared to a standard coffee maker"
4,Cool little device works as advertised,"Very simple little device that brews a great cup of coffee (espresso actually, but just add hot water to make coffee). Works just as advertised. It's replaced my cone filter and French press."
5,Actually quite good as a backup coffee maker,"I bought this to use when travelling, so I can have a coffee in my hotel room. Usually hot water is available, so that makes it easy. One thing has to be understood: This does not make an espresso coffee, but it is better that the typical drip/flow through makers. Someone mentioned crema, probably because he/she does not understand the term. All things taken into account it makes a good cup of coffee when away from my 15 bar espresso machine."
5,I don't even use my coffee machine anymore,"Excellent coffee. It makes dark coffee that isn't bitter. You have to play around with how much coffee to use, how much water to use, the perfect temperature, etc. until you find out how you like it the best. (I use 2 scoops of Starbuck's espresso coffee, fill it up with 170 degree water to the #4, and let it do it's thing.) If I just want a regular tasting cup of coffee I pour some of the hot water in the cup when I'm finished. If I want it to be more like espresso, I drink it as-is.I recommend this to everyone."
5,Awesomeness!,My favorite cup of coffee! Buy it now! Easy to use! No need for Starbucks! No grounds in my coffee! Best coffee ever!
5,the best ever,"I love, love, love the AeroPress! I have tried drip coffee makers, french press, a stove top espresso, single serve machines, and spent a million dollars spent at Starbucks. This little appliance makes the best cup of coffee bar none."
5,Recommended Accesories,"Very pleased with this coffee maker. Been using every day since Christmas 08. Recommend using a Pyrex 400 ml No. 1003 beaker as a receptacle because it has a pouring spout and thick walls. Was using an expresso machine carafe and feared the thin glass walls would crack under pressure from plunging the AeroPress--perhaps unwarranted. Pleasantly surprised that the Pyrex No. 1003 fits nicely inverted over the filter holder that comes with the AeroPress. Only draw-back is the Pyrex beaker doesn't have a handle; since it's 400 ml holding the beaker by the rim provides a manageble grip. Also recommend the ""Happy to Serve You"" ceramic mug as a receptacle for a solo cup of joe.NY Ceramic Cup 10-Ounce We are Happy to Serve You Ceramic Cup"
5,Works great and lasts long time!,Simple to use but be careful not to press too hard. I started to get some coffee grounds to leak through. Experiment with the stir times. I use one and a half level spoonfuls of coffee with boiling water and stir for about 40 seconds. I would definitely recommend this item to friends.
4,AeroPress,I've had mine for over a year and I notice that the rubber plunger must have shrunk because now the coffee seeps out of the top. I still like the concept - it just doesn't work as well anymore.
4,Great for me!,"I enjoy good coffee, but can't afford one of those expensive drip makers. A friend (and coffee lover) recommended this product. IT IS PERFECT for me! It makes the perfect cup of americano every time. I can also vary the strength of each pressing by type of grind and amount of water. Truly my own personal cup of coffee every time."
5,An Excellent Product!,"This is an amazing product! After some tinkering, we're drinking the best cup of coffee ever every morning. Several helpful hints, buy great coffee beans, grind them finely just before brewing, use two filters, wet them before putting in the fresh grounds. Stir for at least 15 seconds until you get a rich creamy brown foam before inserting the press. The components are well designed of high quality materials and seem to be destined for long lasting daily use. The Aeropress will truly change the way you feel about the a morning cup! It is the best value for a product we've ever purchased!"
1,Definitely not espresso,Spent a couple of days trying. I really wanted it to work. Followed the directions carefully. Got slightly better than bitter mud but not by much. Returned it to Amazon.
3,not amazing,"It's okay. It's not (NOT) espresso, and the resulting coffee isn't bad, but (compared to something like a basic pour-over system) it's more complicated and fiddly without an appreciable benefit. After a couple years I almost never bother to pull it out of the cupboard."
2,Trouble,"I just got the Aero PressMore work and mess than a French press and paper filters too, more clean up.The brew was so soI will definitely ReGift this item"
3,lots of work,"The coffee is fine, but there are a lot of loose pieces rolling around on the counter that you have to keep track of. It seems like a lot of work to use and then clean."
4,Glad the plastic problem was addressed (see below),"I love the coffee that comes out of this devise even though it does use a LOT of ground beans to get the taste I want. HOWEVER, with the research coming out on plastic in contact with hot liquids, I'm worried about risk. Would love to find this kind of coffee maker in glass with a protective outer layer."
3,"Aerobie 80R08 AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker, make a better tast coffee","I recently purchased this coffee maker, the operation is not complex and the coffee tast much better. I love it!"
5,"Good, as the reviews predicted","Greatly enjoying the product, just had my first cup. It takes very little time, unlike traditional drips or otherwise expected. Yes it does take some effort in getting the technique down in pressing out the coffee, but I am quite satisfied. Day 1 of product is good"
5,AeroPress,"Im a coffe connoisseur. I love this product because its simple to use and clean and makes the best coffee ever. Better than the french press because its filtered and makes for a constant brew whereas with a french press you get a wider range of taste and strength every-time, not to mention filtering results in less cafestol which raises LDL. Everything fits on nice and snug and you can tell the product was made by a scientist."
5,Great Coffee,"I almost prefer using this to my full sized espresso maker. definitely nice for traveling, and for people that only make 1-4 cups of coffee at a time. great tasting coffee, easy to make, and quick, all it requires is hot water (it's microwavable, so you can just heat it up in the microwave) ground coffee, and you to push down on it. takes about 40 seconds after you have hot water to make it. I've recommended this to all my friends that want a coffee maker, but don't want to buy a drip brewer."
5,Amazing little device,Amazing. My only gripe is I wish the industrial design was better. Simply the best way to make coffee. Use espresso coffee beans and get an inexpensive burr grinder.
5,Love at first sight!,"This thing is amazing. I've never owned a real espresso machine so I can't compare it to one. However, I've made espresso for several friends who have had machines or are espresso junkies and everyone has loved it! It's super easy to use, super easy to clean, and makes super wonderful espresso. A++++++"
5,"AeroPress, Outstanding Value","This is the second AeroPress I own.This device is so easy to use that I now have one at home and another in my vehicle or case for when I have the urge for a really good cup of coffee without paying high prices. It is American designed & MADE in USA product !! The hardest part of making coffee now is waiting for the boiling water.1) Place filter in holder & twist on cover.Place on cup or mug. 2) Add coffee, amount is up to you, comes with measuring spoon. 3) Add almost boiling water to level you want & then stir(Stirrer also provided) for about 30 seconds.Stop stirring place plunger over top and slowly press down till all coffee is in mug and you are done !! You now have an espresso strength coffee or you can add more hot water to bring it to the desired strength you want. Untwist filter holder, save filter (reusable) and push puck of coffee grounds out. I recycle them in my garden. Well worth the price."
5,Just right for a single cup,"I've been looking for some way to get a single cup of coffee that tastes like the first brewed cup of the morning (sometimes I want another cup in the afternoon, but don't want to make a whole pot just to get one cup).This little gem does the trick - no electricity needed, just a cup of hot water and you've got yourself a nice fresh cup of coffee. It took some experimentation to find the right quantities and how long to heat the water, but the end result is so worth it."
5,Sweet Caffeine Maker!,"I've owned one of these for 2 years now, and I love it! I bought this one for my son who's leaving home soon. It's the fastest brew in my house, besides being a darn good cup of Joe. When I need to get out of the house - now - I can actually get my coffee from start to finish in less than 2 minutes . . . and it's good! I love the versatility - I prefer a strong brew, but others may prefer something a bit more liquid. With this wonderful press, you can definitely have it your way! It's easy, fast and does exactly what it says it will. How often do you find that today? Just a sidenote - it says that you can make the filters out of coffee filters cut to measure. Don't. Just go the extra little bit of money for the actual made-to-fit filters. They're worth it!"
4,excellent cup of coffee!,Makes an excellent cup of American or espresso coffee for one! The first time I spent the night at my boyfriend's I awoke to find him in the kitchen boiling water for INSTANT coffee! I knew that wouldn't do so I sent him an Aeropress. Now I can enjoy a pleasant cup of coffee with my honey and the NY Times on Sunday morning. Only problem -- it's definitely a one cup at a time (or two espressos) operation.
4,makes good coffee and very convenient,It makes good coffee compare to those expensive machines. and it's very convenient to use and clean.
1,"Bland, weak tasting","I was really excited to try this AeroPress, and was quite disappointed once I did! I don't understand why, but the coffee I made with it was very plain/watery tasting, regardless of how many scoops of coffee I added. I did, however, notice that caffeine made it through the filter, even if flavor did not as I was wired up unlike I've ever been before.I tried the recommended amount of coffee grounds, less coffee grounds than recommended, and more coffee grounds than recommended. I tried regular drip-brew grind and French press grind. I even had a neighbor brew a cup with his own coffee (he brewed side-by-side with his French press), and under every circumstance the conclusion was the same: the AeroPress makes a tasteless, boring, but definitely caffeinated cup of jo.I'm going back to my French press."
1,I Finally Just Threw It Away,"I bought the Aeropress on the basis of the many positive reviews here on Amazon. I have been a French press aficionado for many years and appreciated the utterly simple design. But I've got to confess that I did my best to brew a simple good mug of fresh-ground coffee using the Aeropress but every effort was fraught with quirky, sloppy and ultimately unsatisfactory results. Why even employ the paper filter when the act of pressing the grounds through the cylinder circumvents that feature?Finally, I had to surrender to my own incompetence and tossed the whole shebang in the trash can. That felt pretty good, I must admit. Better than to keep it in some cupboard and be reminded of a regrettable purchase.Good luck. Most seem to have success with this device."
2,Didn't perform as expected.,"I bough this with the anticipation that it would make great single serve cups of coffee. Despite following all the troubleshooting suggestions, the water quickly drained (did not even need to apply pressure to the device) and left me with weak coffee. I tried doubling the filter, and even adding more grounds, but was not satisfied with the item. Perhaps I got a defective unit? I returned it, got a Keurig single server, and am pleasantly happy."
4,Single Serve Coffee,"Great for single serve coffee. Much easier to clean after use, than traditional ""french press makers"". Have not made Espresso, as I like the ""Presso"" Espresso Machine for that."
5,Makes Great Coffee,"The AeroPress is really simple to use.It is rather affordable, and makes great coffee.You will need is a method of having boiling filtered water on hand to pour into the Aeropress. I use an electric kettle, and use the hot water once it comes off the boil. (I've found that having hot water off the boil is key to having good coffee out of the Aeropress).It's good if you're a single cup coffee drinker, but it can be a little slow to make enough coffee if you're serving guests. It also travels well, in case you're in a country that doesn't have very many coffee shops, and you need your coffee fix."
3,I had high hope...,"The design seems make sense. The reviews are mostly positive. However, I found it OK but not good enough to replace my pod coffee maker. After you pour the hot water, before you stir, 1/3 goes down already. I don't even need to apply pressure. The coffee comes out OK."
4,"Really Cool, Works well, no batista here","This is my third espresso maker, I have a lavazza espresso point, an espresso percolator, and now the Aeropress. The Aeropress is well made, plastic, but not flimsy or cheap feeling. There's definitely a learning curve with it, first few tries were either bitter or used way too much espresso. BUT It works well, it's not necessarily common sense, but doesn't take long to figure out and use appropriately. I think for the price its a good buy for anyone who puts a little extra thought into their coffee.It looses a point purely because you loose out on the foam topping that I've come to expect from both of my other espresso machines."
1,"Wastes Coffee, Cold Coffee","The key to coffee or tea not being bitter is using 195 dF water instead of boiling water. Aeropress recommends 175 dF water. This can easily be done with a Zojirushi 5.0 L Hot water Pot, which is tall enough to fit your cup and the maker underneath.After pressing down, for several minutes my coffee was cold. If you coffee cups has little cracks, you might shatter it with the pressure required for a few minutes to make the coffee.Also their scoop that make one little cup of coffee, and I can make 6 cups of coffee in the Espresso Inox stove top maker. If you want to make less bitter coffee, I recommend a French Press and 195 dF water. There are inexpensive glass ones or the Insulated Stainless Bodum Columbia."
2,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"I FIND THIS PRODUCT ANNOYING TO USE FOR ONE SIMPLE CUP OF COFFEE NOT ESPRESSO. THERE ARE TOO MANY PARTS: CYLINDER, PLUNGER, BASKET, FILTER, MIXER STICK AND COFFEE SPOON.YOU FIRST PUT A PROPRIETARY COFFEE FILTER IN THE BASKET--THEN SCREW IT TO A LONG TUBE AND TRY TO CAREFULLY POUR COFFEE DOWN A NARROW TUBE. THEN YOU NEED TO POUR 2 INCHES OF HOT WATER DOWN THE TUBE AND THEN TAKE A MIXING STICK AND MIX THIS COFFEE SLUSH AROUND. NEXT YOU WET THE RUBBER GASKET ON THE PLUNGER AND THEN ADD REMAINING WATER TO THE RECEIVING TUBE AND INSERT THE PLUNGER DOWN THE TUBE SLOWLY OVER A COFFEE A MUG. AFTER 20 SECONDS YOU GET A REASONABLE 8 OZ CUP OF COFFEE.NEXT COMES THE ANNOYING CLEANUP. COFFEE GROUNDS ALL OVER THE PLUNGER, CYLINDER, BASKET AND MIXING STICK MUST BE WASHED OFF RIGHT AWAY.CONCLUSION: GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL"
2,A coffee press with a filter. Brilliant. Just brilliant.,"I prefer a regular coffee press, and it makes even better coffee, and I don't have to buy special proprietary bleached-white filters at an inflated price, that I have to throw away. One of the major benefits of a regular coffee press is that you don't have to pay extra or throw paper away. What genius thought this one up (and does he get a kickback from the sale of filters)?"
4,Fantastic,This press lives up to its expectations producing great quality coffee. The press is easy to use and clean and faster to make multiple coffees than a machine. In fact I will be purchasing another one soon as a gift.
5,Best Coffee Ever,"I have tried many methods to make coffee-house quality coffee at home, and this product is the solution. I use ordinary beans (i.e. from Trader Joe's), grind them finely just before brewing, and follow the AeroPress instructions. I then dilute it with hot water to make an Americano. The resulting coffee is sweet and not bitter, just fantastic. The AeroPress is inexpensive, well designed, robustly constructed, simple, portable, and thoughtfully accessorized. It seems like a well-kept secret. Give it a try; I think you'll be happy."
4,Great low tech espresso,"The Aeropress makes a GREAT cup of espresso. Probably not the best option if you're impatient, but if you enjoy taking some time to slow life down a bit, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Use it every day,"I use my aeropress every day. Imagine, a coffee gadget made by a yo-yo company! But I love it. it makes great coffee with minimal cleanup and it's very simple. The only warning is to make sure if you buy espresso that you ask the coffee place to grind it a little coarse. If you don't, the fine coffee grounds are very hard to press and you can get yourself a sore elbow. Saves counter space, too."
4,Great for 3 months,"The Aeropress coffee maker does make a great cup of coffee, but it only lasts for 3 months before the inside of the chamber start cracking very badly to the point where it didn't work properly, and just didn't look like something you would want to drink out of... So had this unit held up it would have gotten 5 stars, but as it is this unit is just too low quality.Update: I contacted the company, and they sent me a replacement chamber free of charge! The new chamber seems like its made from a different type of plastic, I'm hopeful that it will hold up better."
5,Best Cup of of coffee ever!!!,"We are very very happy with the AeroPress, it is very simple to use and it makes a great cup of coffee out of the crappiest coffee.. I recommend this item to everyone and I am ready to buy one for work.."
5,Great coffee made simple,"Very happy with my purchase after about 3 months of use. From grinding (small electric grinder) to coffee to cleanup, about a minute total time (not including nuking my milk in the microwave).Tips:I like latte-style, so I heat up milk (plus sweetener) in my mug first--2 mins in the microwave. I don't get a froth (though I could buy a frother) but the milk goes through a similar chemical change. Then make the coffee in the AeroPress. Since I've got an instant-hot water tap (near boiling) I don't have to wait for water to get hot.Cleanup is about 20 seconds. You can't beat it.And the whole thing is small enough to easily travel in my suitcase.Bottom Line: I could have spent close to a thousand bucks on a great Espresso machine, but I didn't think I'd want to go through the daily hassle to use it well. That's not an issue with the AeroPress. It's less hassle than my drip coffee maker, with much better results."
3,"Good Coffee, but Expensive to Use","After reading so many wonderful reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I purchacd an Aeropress. Yes, the device makes good tasting coffee. But I'm convinced it is primarily because it uses SO much coffee! The directions say to use two scoops to make the espresso-ish base for a full cup of American-style coffee. But that is a big scoop! That one cup of coffee is using between 3 and 4 tablespoons of grounds.I know that a high coffee to water ratio makes the best tasting coffe, regardless of the brew technique. Just think about it this way; you wouldn't make a second pot of coffee using the grounds from the last pot... Using a lot of coffee minimizes over-extraction, and leaves the bitter compounds behind. Said another way, it is better to dilute strong coffee with fresh water to get the strength you want than it is to dilute it with fresh water passed through over-used coffee grounds.But the Aeropress is taking this to an extreme."
5,Best Coffee Ever,"The AeroPress makes a great cup of coffee. Unlike a French press, the coffee is devoid of any sediment and tastes so good that you'll be surprised at the difference. Because the grounds and the water are in contact for a short duration (10 seconds), the resulting coffee is so clean and without bitterness.With the AeroPress, I can tell a lot of difference between coffee made with a normal pulverizing bean grinder and a quality burr grinder (I use theCuisinart Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill (CCM-16PC1)). The burr grinder brings out a lot more flavor of the coffee.To make a perfect soymilk latte, I put half of a cup of soymilk into the microwave for one minute, and then press a double-shot of AeroPress espresso directly into the warm soymilk. What a great cup of coffee!"
5,Exudes Quality,The first thing I noticed when I got the AeroPress out of its box was how very well made it seemed to be. Nothing cheap or chintzy about it; it was solidly made and looked as though it would take real effort to break it. I have used it for 2 weeks now and after a little experimentation have found a formula that makes a great cup of coffee to my taste. Using the AeroPress is easy and the clean-up is effortless and quick. This is an excellent product which performs as advertised and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys making and drinking an excellent cup of coffee.
4,Makes great coffee - especially great for iced coffee,I love my AeroPress and it does make a great cup of coffee. I love making iced coffee with my AeroPress - just brew using the enclosed directions and pour over ice - it is delicious! So why 4 stars? It is a bit more work than just a normal coffee pot and you can only make one cup at a time which means twice the work when my husband and I both want a coffee. Overall I would recommend this product especially if you usually only drink one cup at a time.
4,This is my most favorite Horse Stuffed animal,This White Horse its so Beautiful I've had at least one other in the past my brother has another horse like this but its Black this horse I consider a bit like a companion because I always keep it close to me the horse is just the perfect size for the white pillow I keep it on next to me on my bed you got to be careful with this toy because since its white it gets dirty easily my brothers black one doesn't I give this toy a four star because its so nice to keep around every once and a while I replace it with a brand new one white isn't my most favorite color but its Beautiful none the less I would have to say if this horse was real it would be a white stallion my brothers friend a Black Stallion but the two horses make a good pair lol!!! Really they do.
4,excellent for cryptography,"In recent cryptographic research, elliptic functions have been very useful. A problem is that this topic is very specialised. It has been hard to find a text that gives an adequate treatment. Leaving the alternative of going through decades of journal papers.Certainly, elliptic functions have other uses, and the above is not to gainsay those. So if you need a recent book on this topic, Walker might be one of the few possibilities.The only problem cryptographers might have with the book is a wish for a more extended discussion of the interaction with number theory and their field."
2,Poor reproduced photo quality,"I rec'd the item quickly, well packaged and in excellent condition however... the reproduction of the photo was strange and purplish. It seemed as if settings were not correct during printing.Dan Fogelberg Concert Poster Handbill Handsome Face Solo Acoustic Tour Red Rocks Denver"
1,ha ha! smells nice but dont work!,"this does not work on real clogs which are what most people have.do yourself a favor and get some real stuff at the corner hardware store. although this stuff does smell nice and i guess can work to make your pipes smell nice and/or prevent stuff from clogging, although i didnt use it for that.lou"
2,Not worth it!,"The books are fantastic. The DVDs, or at least the Chords and Progressions DVD, merely gloss over the material in the book, without fleshing the material out.I was bummed, but really, when you think about it, how much information could he get on a dvd to augment a relatively comprehensive text.I intend to continue to use the books with an instructor."
1,wow that sucked,"There's movies that are so bad, their good, then there are movies that are so bad its just painful to watch. That's She-Rex. It was awful. And not awful in a good way like every alligator movie ever made, Awful in the really really really bad way that is unwatchable even if your drunk. Just plain pointless and dumb."
1,Dis-Honorable!,"Wow. This album proves that Wu needs to cut the extra fat off their flavorful steak. These guys come off as exactly what they are: Wu Minor League. Killa Sin is a tight MC, but the others all just sound like pale imitations of the original 9 brothers. This was a big dissapointment."
1,If this were a white band that created this hate...,"...it wouldn't exist.Check out actual lyrics:""To all my Universal Soldier's: stay at attention whileI strategize an invasion; the mission be assassination, snipershitting Caucasians with semi-automatic shots heard around the world; my plot is to control the globe and hold the world hostage. . . .see, I got a war plan more deadlier than Hitler. . . . lyrical specialist, underworld terrorist. . . .keep the unity thick likemud. . . . I pulling out gats , launching deadly attacks""Double standards."
4,KILLARMY COMES OFF NICE BUT NOT AS GOOD AS ANTICIPATED!,REALLY I WOULD GIVE THIS 3 1/2 STARS IF I COULD. THIS CD IS MOST DEFINATLY NOT THE WU BUT IF YOU ARE A SHALION FAN YOU WILL ENJOY THIS. THERE SHOULD OF BEEN MORE WU GUEST APPEARANCES. THAT WOULD OF PICKED THIS CD UP ALITTLE. OF THE GROUP ONE PARTICULAR RAPPER STANDS OUT WHO GOES BY THE NAME OF KILLAH SIN. CHECK HIM OUT BECAUSE HE IS HOT. HE IS DOING ALOT OF WORK WITH THE WU OF LATE.
4,Don't front on Killarmy son...,"Listen, a lot of cats will try to call this just another Wu family wack album, but these young gods come with mad skill, flavor and jewels for those who need lessons. Feel them and cop this now. I shouldn't have to tell you cats this, but i'll do my duty."
4,"Move over RZA, your brother has arrived.","As a Wu-tang album, this could be dissapointing, but as the first full-length effort with 4th disciple (Rza's half- brother)behind the boards, it's tight. The beats on this album are so good, I don't even care that the lyrics are kind of lacking. Before this album, I never would have said that anything could be improved with less involvement from Rza, but that's my opinion here.His two beats are some of my least favorite. A warning, though; while 9th Prince shines on the mic and Killah Sin and Dom Pachino are ok, the rest of the rapping is forgettable, and can get old quickly. If you only care about lyrics, save your cash, but the music is worth a listen."
3,"Good Concept, but too many filler songs.","Unlike many off the Wu-spinoff groups that only imitate the original sound, Killarmy's debut sounds fairly original. Instead of focusing on martial arts, Killarmy focuses on war. It even lifts the theme song from M*A*S*H for the track ""5 Star"". Listening to this CD is the equivalent of watching a war film (with plenty of sound effects included).The downside is that a handful of tracks have bland, redundant lyrics (which leads me to believe that this would've made a better EP, than a LP). With a little practice and fine tuning of skills, Killarmy has the potential to blow up."
4,A good album to Chill and Vibe to,"I thought this debut was pretty good. Killarmy seems to have a real rough, raw sound that works best on the laid-back, hypnotic tracks. Case in point: ""Dress to kill"" the first and probably best track on the album. Killarmy rap together in a sort of chant on this track, going great with the beat."
1,Not what you think,"This is not a book, but a fold out pamphlet. It's ok for a pamphlet, but I was looking forward to a book. Unless you just really want it, I would pass. Thanks!"
4,The Cd is tight to be their first album.,"Kane&Abel gives a reality check to the world with the help of Master P,Mo B. Dick,and Mia X.This duo takes No Limit to that next level.They are two blocks on the foundation of the No Limit empire."
1,MacQuarie Retail,"Some thought it propitious to vacillate in an untoward fashion at the periphery of the lagniappe. But K&A know better. They're the ones who sliced off a piece of that responsory and took it home to their mommas. Ill advised, dudes. Now EVERYBODY wants a piece of it, too, and there's just not enough to keep 'em all happy. That's why I'm glad they've settled here on a nice little chrestomathy. It fits neatly in your pocket and doesn't make much noise (although it does tend to congeal into a gelid reticulum if you're not paying attention). ATTENTION MUST BE PAID, in this instance. Who would want it otherwise?Kaplan would, I bet."
3,Taking Sides Takes Time to Read,"This book is an adiquate book for a communication's class. The book changes editions too many times forcing students to buy the newest edition. The cover on this book is pretty lame, it has to be changed soon. Durf!"
2,They don't make them like they used to,"If you remember your Rock'em Sock'em Robots from childhood, start searching tag sales and Ebay because the new version can't compare. The game is much smaller than the original and not very sturdy (Zurg falls without hitting him). It is not a game for two children, because Buzz almost always wins. If your child loves Toy Story there are much better options available."
2,Rock em' sock em',"I didn't like this toy because the arms hardly move. And, it's basicly rigged, because it's impossible for buzz Lightyear to hit emporer zurg's chest. Either Lightyear's arm is too short or whimpy, or zurg's arm is too long and srong. so when me and my sister play it, who ever has zurg always wins."
3,a promising future,"There is no standout tracks ,but there is no duff tracks either.the cd grows on you with repeated listens and will sit nicely next to your golden smog and jayhawks.tangletown are a band who we should keep an eye on in the future."
4,Great Fun!,"This is a great toy. The suction cups don't work worth a darn, but the rest is great. My daughter has oodles of fun with it, and so do I..."
1,very very very very very very disappointed,"This hair accessory should be listed for children or babies as it was so small it was useless for an adult with long hair.In the title or somewhere in the description it should say ""for infants"" or ""for childreN'These are not rubber bands for adults.I did not return them due to the costs and time involved for such a product made it not worthwhile.I was VERY DISAPPOINTED.Please describe this product better."
3,ok cd,"It's a cool cd to kick back and drink a brew to. Also, does anybody know what the background music is on the intro? The g-funk is tight."
3,Disappointed,"Although I found some of the content of the book useful, like how a camera actually works and how different kinds of film is developed, the rest of the book seemed to drag on and on. There is also many typos throughout the book, especially towards the end and I found myself reading some of the same sentences over and over trying to make sense of what the author was trying to say because of the typos. It dosent go into alot of depth on how to actually capture a spirit on film either. This is what disappointed me the most. All and all though I will keep this book on hand in my paranormal investigations as a reference book on camera and film but I could have bought a book from Kodak for that."
4,Equipment Advice and Information,"I expected a bit more on the best time to take pictures or video, popular ""hang outs"", ways of bringing out the most phenomena, and even some tips on how to handle yourself when in a situation where these things occur. I found TONS of information-up to date information-on what camera equipment is best and why. I found a LOT on the history of cameras. A bunch on why a camera works whether it is digital or not. Also how best to create a situation where if you get a strange shot, you are less likely to debunk it since conditions were perfect. Thermometers, humidity tests, EMPs, Infared.Seemed it was more for the serious photographer, and studier of pictures rather than the person who would like to experience paranormal activity and come away with some shots as well."
5,Awaken Gently in the Morning and Gently Relax in the Evening.,"If you want to try yoga, or if you are older and inflexible, or if you are recovering from an illness, A.M. and P.M Yoga might be a good match for you!In the a.m. portion of the DVD, Rodney Yee guides you through very gentle yoga positions, which will help energize you and prepare you to make the best of the opportunities in your day. Patricia Waldren provides equally relaxing, but slightly more difficult yoga positions, to help you relax in the evening.Breathing correctly during poses is an important part of yoga. A better DVD that incorporates breathing into more slightly more challenging yoga positions is Element's AM and PM yoga for beginners, with instructor Elena Brower, a certified Anusara teacher."
3,Not really for beginngers,The a.m. portion of this DVD is helpful. The p.m. portion is much too advanced for this over-60 and returning-to- yoga beginner.
4,Black Beards Ship,"To begin with, this is not a ship that Black Beard would ever have sailed as a pirate ship. This kit is a re-release of a much older kit. Overall this is a fun kit to build but more interesting if you dis-guard what is on the box top and find out exactly what the ship is a model of and work toward that end. There is plenty on the net to research what this really is and the molded flags will also help. I doubt that any pirate ever had a ship this heavily armed. Overall the fit of the pieces for this model is not very good so it does take some skill to get things to line up and stay lined up while the glue dries. It is to bad that the sails are molded to the spars doing this does limit your options. The many small peices and the ability to paint the very fine details adds challenge to this kit and provides some additional enjoyment to the project."
1,"Zero Sarts ALLLL the way! sorry..it sucked, and I returned, and come to think of it i never got my money back....","Dislike GREATLY!!! Im sorry, it was cheap, not durable, and falsely advertised....I didn't like it that I even returned it to get my money back, and I never got payed back. Anywho, Im sure this company makes great toys, but this one is very pitiful...dont buy it!"
1,Watch the measurements,"It's nice and soft but unfortunately, didn't fit the pad I bought for the changing table."
2,Sending them back,"Even though the pink is very pretty and they are very soft, I'm sending back the two covers I got today. The one that I opened has a light stain that is about an inch by two inches right on top, the strap holes are also on the top of the cover and do not work with my pad, and the cover doesn't fit my pad very well. I'm going to exchange them for the more expensive but much better quality basic comfort covers."
5,So pretty!!!!,So pretty and soft. Easy to clean and durable. Stains come right out! Great fit on the changing table pad! Absolutely love it!
5,So soft!,The fabric is so soft and it was exactly what I needed for my contoured changing pad. Only thing I do not like are the holes for the security straps. I do not use the straps so the holes are not needed. You can not beat the price!
1,"Soft, but the slits for the straps are in the wrong place!","When I found out that my second child was going to be a girl, I was excited to add some pink into the nursery. I ordered this soft pink changing pad cover, only to wonder ""How is this supposed to work?!"" when it arrived! All of the other changing pad covers I own have the slits for the changing table straps on the sides. This one has the slits way in the middle! Any child over a newborn size will be lying on top of those straps. The cover is very soft- yes. But I had to return it because of the placement of those slits!"
2,Failed to mention strap holes!,"The product description failed to mention that this pad cover has holes for straps. We don't use straps, so it looks funny."
1,Or...not so much,Too thin and holes on side in the way if you don't use the straps on the changing table all the time. Not worth the money.
1,Slits in Wrong Place!,"The slits for the straps are way up in the center rather than down on the sides like the other brand I ordered. I wish I would have paid attention to the other reviews before I ordered because now I'm having to return this. It's very soft, but the placement of those slits makes no sense at all. Don't waste your time buying this product! Summer Infant makes one with the same fabric that is actually less expensive and has the slits in the correct spots!"
1,reeks of moth balls,"Wow. This thing reeks of moth balls which not only is unpleasant, but also one of the most highly toxic materials you can have around and certainly not something you would want to put near a baby. it's like selling an asbestos changing pad cover. Too bad. Would be nice but the smell and chemicals in moth balls won't wash out."
3,Should have read about the straps!,"We were using the straps for our changing pad but this item (like everyone else said) failed to mention that the slits for the straps are in the center of the pad. I don't think my son (11mo ~25lbs) will be able to be strapped down because it limits the length of the strap! Kinda ticked... Their other changing pad covers do show the straps coming out of the middle but I guess I just missed it on this one. UGH! Otherwise, the fabric is comparable to our other covers from Carters."
2,Openings are in the wrong place,Item was received on time. Material is soft. The only problem is that the changing cover openings are in the wrong place for standard changing pads. They should be located on the sides but are located in the middle of the cover instead which makes it very difficult to change the baby.
4,"Soft material, holds up on multiple washings well",The holes for the straps are a little big and look more prominent than others. But I really like the material and how it wears (over months of washings).
2,I like Spike but...,This book is really very monotonous and uninteresting. There are very few characters that one got to know enough to care about. This seemed to me to be no more than an excuse to show the innovative and grotesque ways that Spke killed the watchers in waiting. I like Spke and Dru on the series and wanted to like this book but it was not readable.
2,Not enough Spike & Dru!,"I'm a huge fan of the Buffy series and Spike is my favorite character. I was very excited to see there was a book written specifically for his character with insight into his life prior to Sunnydale.Although the setting is interesting (1940's - World War II), this book tends to have way too much detail about the Slayer, potential-Slayers and their Watchers (along with miscellaneous demons) and not nearly enough about Spike and Dru. They almost seem like secondary characters!Basically it wasn't what I expected. I was looking for a more intimate detail of their relationship and life together and they were barely even in this book."
4,"Shock Me, Shock Me, Shock Me with your Deviant Behavior.","This book made me wonder if Golden hated this past year's major storyline of Spike being seduced by the Light side. There is absolutely NO goodness in these characters.A great way to pass a rainy day. If you like the character of Spike, then you will enjoy this book. However, if you like Spike, you have probably already decided to buy this book, so what are you doing reading this?What else is there to say in this review? It's no classic. Cliffs Notes will not be written on it. (Maybe in a parallel Buffyverse.) If you are a Buffy fan, I recommend it. The Buffy withdrawels you will experience during the summer will be alleviated by this Masterpiece of Golden Spikehood."
2,A disappointed Buffy fan,"I know that Spike and Dru are evil and vicious, but some of the descriptions of the deaths were a little too graphic for me. Also, on the TV show, I like Spike and Dru. I did not like them in this book. And I got tired of being introduced to characters, fairly fleshed out characters, only to see them die. Plus a major even in the end is not consistent with the TV series (Spike has only killed two slayers - a Chinese girl during the Boxer Rebellion and Principal Wood's mother - here he kills another). So I was actually quite disappointed in this book."
1,Fall apart instantly,"These sandals were very comfortable, for the entire four hours I owned them before they broke. My first time wearing them, I went out to dinner with some friends. I didn't walk more than a mile throughout the night, but the entire padding separated from the sandal bottom. The sandals were ruined. I'll never buy this brand of sandal again. What a waste of $25. I paid $30 for my last pair of Reef sandals and wore them constantly; they lasted almost 4-years."
5,just great,"I bought this for someone with very sensitive skin, and it works great. Maybe the last reviewer didn't follow the directions. I highly recommend it."
2,Apparently she said they slipped off...,This was a gift and she said these slipped off her feet while walking so I had to return and get the ones from the mall that she originally bought. Though she said the memory foam was nice before the slippage occurred.
3,"quick ship, good product","I received this part very quickly after ordering. At first they seem to run small, but after wearing a few times they stretched and formed to my feet. i enjoy them after a long hard day at work."
2,Spend Extra - Buy the original,Product was as described but very little support. I have a pair of Temperpedic brand and these are NOTHING like them. Better to spend $50 and get a great pair of slippers rather than these knock-offs.
1,HORRIBLE knock offs,"DO NOT BUY!!! These are NOT memory foam slippers, they're pure garbage. Plus the sizing is off, these are wayyyy too small.My feet began to sweat as soon as i put them on, the soles are made of the slipperiest plastic I've ever seen and there is no memory foam whatsoever in these. Just cheap foam one would find as packing material. Terrible across the board.Wish i had read the reviews before ordering or noticed that these were from the ""AS SEEN ON TV"" folks, they only make cheap knock offs. More like ""ASS seen on TV"" am i right people?Seriously though DO NOT BUY THESE SLIPPERS!"
3,Men's Comfort Slippers.,"The slippers after awhile seem to be too big. When new they contour to your foot, after wards loose on your foot. OK on flat surface, but would not want to go up and down stairs. If I hadn't worn them for a month, I would ask to return them."
2,"Too small, too narrow","Although these slippers were good looking, my son could not wear them because they were too small and too narrow. The size was his normal size but these slippers tend to be smaller than the usual. I had to purchase another pair in another venue."
2,An orgy of art houses with hard to read floor plans,"Make no mistake, TNAH3 is beautiful. I loved the photos, especially of the interiors of the homes. However the floor plans are very difficult to read:- numbers corresponding to a legend, and not words or obvious icons (like say a table and 4 chairs to indicate a dining room) are used for each room- it is hard to tell with some of the larger designs what is interior or exterior, what's a wall versus a fence- dimensions are not provided for either the rooms or the overall structure"
5,Beyond awesome! Nearly impossible to find ...,"Though the correct title is ""His Last Days"" ... this is one of Dallas Holm's BEST recordings. While the Passion has been told many times, many ways and this imparts nothing new in the story but it does offer some prospectives from people other than the main people involved in the Passion. ""Mary's Song"" will soften even the toughest person, as Mary looks at her son hanging on the Cross and she asks ""is this the boy I raised?"" Particular stand-outs include ""Calvary"" and ""What Kind of Man Is This?"" (the former told by Peter and the latter told by the Roman Officer who oversaw the crucifixion).The musicians and singers who recorded this album with Dallas Holm are awesome in their own right. The women and one man worked with Dallas in the Praise band.Highly recommended. Very rare. From 1978/1979, available in the early 1990s on a limited time from Benson Records. Available only on vinyl LP and cassette, never on CD.Blessings ..."
1,dissapointed,"I ordered this sight unseen (there is no picture) what I got was a very dirty ,creamer with a bubble in the glaze and no Hommer Laughlin stamp. Once it was washed, it was cute, but without the stamp, not fiestaware..and still a bubble, something you might get at a tag sale for a dime. Amazon needs to do a better job with quality control."
2,Go with another brand,Ingersoll rand is dropping there quality. The trigger was very stiff. My Chicago Pneumatic has more power and feels a ton better then this.
2,Too small,This product was actually too small for me to start decorating or putting in photos. Very cute and more like a children's project.
3,Monini Truffle Oil,"The product is slightly above average for comparable products. The service from the vendor was excellent once contacted about delivery. Their warehouse was behind on shipments when first ordered and did not notify me that a delay would be experienced. Once I contacted the vendor, I received the product within 3 days."
4,classic tunes that take you back a generation,"Survivor's CDs were more entertaining than I'd thought they would be. I knew more of the songs and got to sing along. You'll be taken back to a specific time in your earlier life, and the memories will be pleasant, I assure you."
5,Never get tired of listening to the Survivor !,I never get tired of listening to the Survivor CD. It always perks me up and gets me dancing through the day. With this CD I am a Survivor of daily Life.
5,Performance over Cost all the way,"These speakers offer incredible sound quality for music, gaming AND movie watching. That is of course unless you're in a padded cell with knitting needles stuck into your ears...They give clear bass at all volume levels, and unlike many models of computer speakers when there is a strong bass level-it doesnt drown the rest of the audio out, nor does it overload the speakers. Extremely crisp sound from the 5 satellites and there is an acceptable amount of bass for normal music listening even with the sub-woofer turned all the way off. With it turned up, DVD's and games are brought to a par-level with my old Panasonic stereo when it was hooked up to my computer. Overall, for the performance, the cost is absolutely minimal. Get these if you need sound to come, cheap, fast, and awesome. Only downside? It takes about an hour to get all the packaging off these dang things..."
5,Great set of affordable surround sound speakers,These speakers provide the perfect balance of cost and performance. With the proper sound card these provide spectacular sound.
4,Inspire 5.1,The Creative Inspire 5.1 5300 is a good buy. It delivers stunning performance at an affordable price. I would recommend this system to any gaming fan to beef up your experience.
3,they aren't that good,"if you like loud music or games and want to enjoy dolby digital soround, then you shouldn't buy these speakers. because they work well with the games, but they do not really work with the music or movies.but if you don't like music or games loud, then you should get these speakers."
2,Not much of a toy,"I bought this for my son when he was 7 months old. He didn't play with it then, and he doesn't play with it now that he's 12 months. It is supposed to enhance his pincer grasp and his fine motor skills, but he won't look at it long enough to improve either. If he pays any attention to it at all, it is simply to throw it or fling it out of his toy box onto the floor. Total waste of money."
2,Not Impressed,"I wouldn't waste my money on this toy. First, the ""moveable"" bees are extremely hard to move because the slider poles are too close together. There are three buttons to push that light up and make different noises (very loud noises)...bees buzzing, birds chirping, and Pooh talking. My biggest problem with this toy is that my son has gotten his little arm stuck in it, and, at 9 months, cannot figure out how to get it unstuck. All in all, not a great buy."
1,Disappointed,"My husband bought this for my daughter before she was a year old. It's one those toys that had held her interest but not at home (it must be Pooh that captures the attention). The bees are a bit hard to manipulate and there's really not alot of them. For an extra 10 or 20 dollars I would suggest getting a real beaded ""rollercoaster"""
3,My daughter likes it...but...,"My 7 month old is playing with this toy. She like the way the ""bees"" slide and spin, and she is getting to use her fingers to make them move, rather than her whole hand (fine motor skills are getting used). I like it for her because it is one of the few things with small pieces that I don't have to worry about her eating! There are very few things I have for her that let her work her fore-finger/thumb piercing skills and let me relax while she plays with it. Needless to say at her age nearly everything goes in her mouth.My one big complaint is that it doesn't attach to anything. I guess I could buy double sided velcro or something like that, but I'd rather buy a toy with suction cups or fasteners already attached. It would be one less thing to worry about falling off and getting eaten....and not permanent like velcro."
1,Waste of $$$,"This toy was one where my son loved it in the store and has never looked at it again. You know the type! The bars are too close together and the wings on the bees are too long, so it's impossible for the child to manipulate the bees more than an inch or two. My child has literally not picked it up once. Don't waste your money on this toy!"
3,There's no direct link for the files inside the Kindle Edition,"The book is great, however there is an issue with the files ATM. There should be a link inside the book, so you could download the media content using a regular computer.I could get access after exchanging some emails through berkleepress.comI had initially given 1 star as I couldn't find the link. After they sent me the link directly I upgraded it to 3 stars. (-2 stars for the hassle of having to go through several channels till I could get the files).If they fix it.. then it should be a 5 stars as it's a great content."
5,QB 13728N Alternator,"I chose this alternator because of cost. It was less expensive and no core charge than a rebuilt one at local shops in my area. Why buy a rebuilt if you can buy a new one. For the alternator itself. It is as advertised ""Brand New"". New case and internals. It even came with a new plastic deflector. All connections were new. After installing the alternator. I used an ohm meter to check the output. It put out 15v. My car is now repaired and it cost me less than I expected."
5,No.1 Book on Streaming Media,"I am a Streaming Media expert running Astream.net for 5 years. We now have offices in London, New York and LA. Simply put without Dan Rayburn's advice and tips (as contained within his new book) the company would not have grown as fast. The book contains everything you need to know about starting your own streaming media and webcasting business. Most importantly it teaches you how to contact corporations and convince them to use streaming. A fantastic body of work."
4,Excellent refresher,"If you have had some type of accounting experience before but are rusty, this book is excellent as it easily brings back accounting knowledge which one once possessed. Not very detailed and advanced, but an excellent guide for a refresher course."
1,Try John Deere and Me instead,It looks like someone with a handicam just went to 3 work sites and left the recorder on. The editing looks like someone with a simple program on the computer did it.
4,Enjoyable miltary SF book,"Another enjoyable book in this series, as usual abnett produces credible and competent villains, maybe less so than usual. This book detaches a small set of the ghosts for an infiltration and assassination mission on a chaos-controlled world, Gereon. It also deals with the gradual re-emergence of the traitor general while in the hands of chaos forces.spoilers followdescriptions of the tools and forces available to chaos (wirewolves, glyphs) was very well done, typical abnett. the entire chaos-enviroment background was seemless and really set the tone of this book.gaunt's forces taking out a squad of chaos ex-astartes, on the face of it, was hard to buy, even with abnett's writing.book did seem to drag a little towards the end, but still enjoyable way to pass a few hours. a definite read."
4,Probably the most exciting mission of Gaunt ghosts !,"12.12 elements of the First and Only volunteers for a mission ranked extremely risky /suicide.12 ghosts led by the only one : Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt.12 in pursuit of one.traitor.12 between life and death IN every choice, every step, every meeting.12 in the heart of the invasion forces from the arch-enemy : Blood pack, Sons of Seck and chaotic werewolf.12 on an infiltration mission for one month on the agri- world of Gereon.Will they arrive before the rupture of the traitor general mind lock by the psyckers of the arch-enemy ?Will they ultimately leave the dark Géréon ?"
1,Not recommended,"If you like the idea of using Mary Bergin's recipes, try to get them off the internet. I made the chocolate truffle cake off a Food Network recipe (she was a guest chef) and it worked out very well. I tried to make it again using this book and it did not work.For the marble pound cake, the instructions indicated that a double recipe would work in a 10 inch bundt. There was way too much batter - so much that it would not even fit in the pan so I used about 2\3 of the batter. Also, the instructions called for twice the amount of cocoa in the chocolate part than should be suggested. If I had used the suggested amount, I would have had pound cake mixed with brownies. Finally, the temperature suggested was too high for a cake that dense. The top burned and the center was raw when I removed it from the oven. There are serious deficiencies in this book - I suggest you find another chocolate recipe resource."
1,These recipes don't work at home!,"I don't know how these recipes turn out at Spago, but I don't believe they were ever tested in home kitchens! I've tried three different recipes and each had problems. The chocolate peanut butter brownies overflowed my 8-inch pan (you would think that knowing there was so much batter, the authors might have specified a larger or higher pan). The Marbled Pound Cake was dry beyond belief, and half of the Fudgy Chocolate Cake remained stuck to the bundt pan, despite proper buttering and flouring. When I made it a second time in another pan, it was still difficult to remove because it was so fragile.It's a shame, because that same fudgy cake had delicious batter, and some of the ideas are fabulous. But I don't have time to experiment with very expensive ingredients. Or spend money on a book full of expensive ideas, rather than recipes."
1,A follow-up to my previous review,"I thought people should know that I wrote to both the authors and the editor of this cookbook with questions about the recipes I made that didn't turn out properly. Even though I wrote more than four months ago, I have heard nothing back. Evidently they don't really care enough as long as the book is bought and paid for."
3,Undecided,"If you are expecting anything like the movies or the other books in this series, it isn't. If I had read the reviews first I might have gone into it with a different attitude and enjoyed it more. As it is, it has little to do with the man in the iron mask but much to do with politics and while it is probably very accurate in the portrayal of the undercurrents and maneuverings and betrayals and alliances, it was not what I expected so I was disappointed. Just understand, it isn't like the others and you might enjoy it a lot more. I felt that if there were a moral it would be ""no good deed shall go unpunished"" and ""might makes right""."
3,Rude surprise,"Sorry, I am not a literary geek, and I was shocked by this 'original.'I had seen the movie and was expecting a jovial, grand conclusion to the Musketeers, but wow, this is anything but.I am not sure if I should mark the rest of the review as a spoiler since it is OLD, but basically you have our beloved Musketeers basically having to turn against each other, outlive one or the other, and the reader must witness the death of 3 out of the 4, and the man in the iron mask doesn't even play that much of a role especially after he wears the iron mask.Not that it is of no value as it is quite riveting and somewhat awakening, but nothing Disney about this one so don't start reading it when you want to be uplifted."
1,Don't waste your time!!!,"If you saw the movie and thought that you might enjoy reading the book, think again. The book is very confusing and is very loosely related to the book. In the book, there are way to many characters that have very little role in the plot. Also...the actually Man in the Iron Mask is hardly a part of the novel. Dumas wrote more about the other characters instead."
3,title,"From the 30 min of what i watched of the movie, the book is nothing alike. Interesting plot and it was very tough to predict the outcome. It's worth reading the 3 Musketeers first, and The Count of Monte Cristo is still my favorite Dumas book."
1,unless you're a dumas fan,"I admit I've only read this book and 'the three musketeers', none of the others in between. I'm usually a big fan of so-called classics. I didn't like the three musketeers much, but I hated this. After TTM I wouldn't really have been pushed to read any more Dumas, but I saw two film versions and wondered how they could be so different. Now I see that it's because TMITIM doesn't really deal with the king and his brother at all. Just another story about those musketeers. And it really is such a good idea. I usually never recommend this, but watch one of the films (I love the oldest one) instead of reading the book. Maybe if I had read it a little slower, I might have found it more easy to read, but I was eager to get to the end and find out what happened to Philippe and Louis, and was very disappointed when they weren't mentioned."
2,Slow start,"I chose two stars because after reading the ""Three Musketeers"" and seeing this book on reading list for years thought it would be of interest to me. However, even though the plot was a good one, the story moved much to slowly for me and after reading fifty pages chose not to finish it."
4,it was good,"Great book, gotta love good literature. Not as good as the three musketeers but a pretty good sequel. I would recommend it"
3,No wonder people like the movies.,"I've been reading for about two weeks and I'm only 35% through the story. The language is the education in these stories. If you can appreciate how language has evolved and how references to mythology are employed, well, it's a good education. Unfortunately, the tedious descriptions make it difficult to follow characters and plot line. In an age where everyone expects immediate gratification, it's no wonder this classic has fallen to the wayside. I'm going to complete the book because, like spinach, it's good for you, but I doubt I'll undertake ""The Three Musketeers"", unless it's the candy bar."
4,exciting,"It's very exciting. Excepts John Grisham's books i never been felt ""exciting"". So i wait the ""Iron maske2"". Ha ha ha......!"
3,Miss titled,After reading the book I found myself woundering if it wasn't miss titled. Over the last half of the book has nothing to do with the 2 brothers as mucha s it does the fall of the Musketeers. Dumas brings closure to the story of his heroes rather well. I just had a little problem reading it because of it being translated in to a higher english than I am use to.
2,Don't waist your time like I did.,"I read this book, and it was interesting at the beginning. Then Alexandre Dumas ended the situation with the Man in the Iron Mask. Then he uses the rest of the book as a history book. It's as boring as heck. I'm not a fast reader, but it took me months to finish this book. I think I wasted my time with it to tell you the truth. Dumas should've gave it a different title, because the situation with the Man in the Iron Mask was not even going on for half the book."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I don't see why anyone would like this book. The Man in the Iron Mask is only in the beginning, and then it's a history lesson. Why did Dumas call it ""Man in the Iron Mask"" when that situation was only for less then half the book. If you think this is just a whole book on the situation ""Man in the Iron Mask"" then don't read it. Becasue that situation is only at the beginning, then Dumas gives a history class. Though if you want to see the movie, see it. It may have not gotten good reviews, but heck it's better then the book."
4,"A wonderful, complex, and depressing swashbuckling adventure","This book was very confusing at times, but all in all, very entertaining. It had humor, romance, fighting, and TRAGEDY. I would have given this novel a perfect ten if the ending were happier."
5,Better than the movie,"This is one Dumas best works, and to those who dislike i say this: to say it has an awful ending means you have completely missed the point. There a number of peaple (the makers of the recent film included) who seem to believe that it's about a man who is forced to wear an iron mask, it isn't. The book is actually about the destinies of the musketeers and how they meet them, the mask is simply a plot vehicle for this. Secondly the book makes little or no sense if read out of secquence with the others, you see this is the final part of dumas final musketeers story (the vicomte de bragelone) and should be read after the other parts. All that said this is great book, only dumas can take 120 pages to tell one day and keep us gripped. The ending is wonderfully sad and still keeps us guessing."
3,Good but expected more,"I saw and loved the movie so I just had to get the book to compare, books are usually better. The problem is that it doesn't compare, the stories are totally different. That being the case the book was interesting, exciting at some points and a little difficult to understand because of the era in which it was written. It has little to do with the ""man"" in the iron mask and it is more an extension of the Three Musketeers."
1,Children's lit fan,"Don't be fooled. This is NOT Dumas, it is a rewrite. The target audience seems to be kindergarteners."
3,A book that I thought was a DVD,"I oredered this book but I thought I was order a DVD my mistake, but its always a pleasue doing business bie Amazon.Ron"
4,The Man in the Iron Mask,"This book was really long and could be incredibly confusing at times but all in all it was a very good, in-depth book. If you have read ""The Three Musketteers"" Then you absolutly must read this book, it follows the adventures of Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'artangan. The man in the mask is actually a very minor charactor in the cast. He hardly matters at all except as a way for Aramis to display his cunning and the loss of his loyalty to his fellow Musketteers. If you have enjoyed The Three Musketteers, or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo, then you will probably enjoy this but be warned that it is quite confusing at times and that it is pretty lengthy. Happy Reading!"
4,"Slow Begining, But a Fun Read","I bought this book thinking it was the sequel to the Three Musketeers, which I really enjoyed. What I didn't realize was that there are a number of books in between these two and so I was a bit lost in the beginning with some of the plots and characters (like Raoul, son of Athos, and Louise). Once I got aquainted with what was going on though, I found the book just as exciting, funny, and entertaining as the first.I would definitely recommend this book, but you might want to read some of the prior books first to get the most out of it."
3,The best of The Vicompte de Braggelonne,"The man in the iron mask is the third and best part of the very long novel, The Vicompte de Braggelonne. It is also by far the best part. Louise de la Valliere, the second part, is really boring; and only the first third or so of the first part (also named the Vicompte de Braggelonne) is any good. When you read this book completely (the 3 parts), it becomes blatantly clear that Dumas had become very famous and earned by the page. The amount of ""filling"" is enormeous. If you want to read first class Dumas, read The Count of Montecristo (5 stars) or the Three mousketeers (4.5 stars). The fact is that the movie, The man in the iron mask, is an adaptation of the Vicompte (it takes something from the three parts) that, rarest of things, improves from the novel."
5,Best Travel Guide of Nepal,"This is the most fantastic travel guide I've ever used and the only one you will need in Nepal. Bezruchka's love and respect for the Nepali people is evident in every line and will enhance your journey to Nepal as well. We followed his advice and had a much richer experience for it. We watched other tourists who didn't follow his advice being laughed at and ignored. The language book and tape that you can order were incredibly helpful, way better than any dictionary. We were able to converse competently which made a huge difference in our experience. Don't bother with the Lonely Planet guide, which just tells you how to get through the country as cheaply as possible. There is so much more to experiencing Nepal than saving a buck here and buck there."
5,Everything you need to know about trekking in Nepal!,Fifteen years ago I started my trekking company's operation in Nepal with information from this book! The trek descriptions and the information on organizing a trek offer all the nuts and bolts. The background information is fascinating as are Dr. Bezruchka's views on poverty and culture shock.
5,As Good as it Gets!,"Trekking in Nepal is an excellent guide for anyone seriously looking to travel there. The upside of this book is it is all inclusive. This book walks you through every category of information you will wonder about before you go. It thoroughly discusses all preparations you'll need to take, customs you'll want to be aware of, and realistically where you can expect to go and how to get there. It also has lots of great information about how to realistically make a trek to Nepal with minimal funds, and how to travel lightly there without negatively affecting the local community.The only downside to this book is it is getting a little dated. Some of the statistics are already obsolete. Many of the routes and roads also need to be updated. While this book is a goldmine of great information, it is probably necessary to purchase updated trail maps. Either way, I'm sure anyone interested in learning about trekking in Nepal will enjoy every page of this great book.-Szen"
1,Misleading description,"this product was NOT as advertised. It is only compatible with Mac OS9, rather than OS 10, as described in the blurb. It's a great program, which I used for years, but without the update to OS 10, it is useless. I sent it back. I would gladly buy a version compatible with my current Mac -- but i don't think it exists. I don't know who is to blame for the misleading advertising."
5,"I like this shoe, but make sure you read the product description","I like this shoe and would buy again, but it's not my everyday shoe because it has a vent on the sole.I like to wear it for many outdoor activities but if you are not prepared to get your feet wet, you shouldn't wear them.This is a durable shoe and fits me well. I got a great deal on this here at Amazon."
1,Don't buy these...,Save yourself some money and just buy the Crayola washable markers. They are much cheaper and work the same.
3,L Sepulvado-Doodle Bear Marker Accessory 5 Pack,"Since the markers are used with the Doodle Bear/Monster, you are sort of stuck with using them, instead of being able to use other washable markers. I thought they were sort of over-priced."
4,Doodle Bear Markers,"For the purpose of what these markers are made for - great! You can also use them on regular paper, as well, which is a good thing.... Kids usually color their bear in pretty quickly."
5,FINE AND FABULOUS!!!,"Diane Schuur has it all! She tackles some of the most vocally difficult songs in the business yet she makes them her own. When you hear her play Nardis, you wonder why she hasn't cut an instrumental album with other jazz great instrumentalists. She definitely can hold her own with any accomplished jazz musician.There are delightful moments filled with engaging color as well as soulful journeys that are hauntingly beautiful. Some songs are lush and lengthy. It takes a lot of guts to sing ""Over The Rainbow"" and make it different. But Diane brings a new heart to this song and she sings it a cappella.Grammy worthy? You bet! This cd is probably Diane's best on many levels. She showcases many facets of her musical genius. Her spontaneity will have you instantly feel that you are at a live performance. Diane Schuur is one of the grandest jazz singers ever born, plus a superlative mistress of the ivories."
3,A Disappointing Diane,"Ms. Schuur, in most cases a passionate and visceral performer, took one of the most haunting of melodies on this CD and screeched through it. The song is ""Invitation."" Not only did she stomp the melody: she massacred the lyrics through a series of screech-scats. By contrast, another of her albums, LOVE SONGS, is marvelous because she doesn't put herself above either the tune or the lyric. For example, note the poignant beauty of her rendition of ""Speak Low"" and ""September In The Rain."" Her current album chooses excellent tunes, like ""Betwitched,"" ""Good Morning Heartache"" and ""If You Could See Me Now."" Delivering them, she becomes a bit more humble, moving closer to the Diane Schuur I've grown to admire. Perhaps on her next album she will keep her ego in perspective by honoring the Triumvirate: Singer, Tune, Melody--all of which must share parity and synergy."
4,Perfect Dress Shoe,This was the perfect dress shoe for a wedding or any dressy affair. I usually take a wide so I wasn't sure if it would fit. It was perfect and with the strech strap it was easy to put on and take off. I was very happy with this purchase.
3,Gorgeous but uncomfortable,"These sandals look exactly like they are pictured. The color was perfect,the rhinstones not over-done, and the heel was just right! That is the end of the positive. The lining inside of the sandal causes your feet toslip forward if you are wearing hose and your baby toes will get caught inthe loop as you walk, it also applies pressure on your baby toes, the material does not give at all! Yes they are gorgeous, but very uncomfortable."
3,"Good reference, but not comprehensive","This book is undoubtedly a good reference, but you should not consider it a comprehensive one.With a decidedly American slant, the book ignores the rich photography cultures of Japan, Russian constructivists and even of Europeans after 1945. Even on the topics which the book does cover, there are a few glaring ommissions. But I'm still glad to see this book come out and the author certainly makes no claims that the books list is a comprehensive one, just a seminal one."

3,Romance when you least expect it,"As usual the women are strong, competent, intelligent, and beautiful. The romance is the kind to bring a tear to your eye and a wish to you mind.The first story ""Impulse"" while enganging and interesting is not very believable but nonetheless a good story. Filled with colorful descriptions and great characters.""The Best Mistake"" is more down to earth. A simple plan to earn more money by renting the houses extra apartment to help a single mother earn enough to cut back on her work hours to be with her son leads to more than she bargained for. I doubt if there is a single mother who doesn't wish a Coop could show up on her doorstep no matter how happy, confident, and competent she was.If your in the mood for a romance you can't go wrong with these two."
4,Two of a Kind Struck It Rich!!,Here is why Nora Roberts is so good at what she does. This lady can write a love story like no other. Impulse was written in 1988 and still steamed off the pages. A fantasy but what a fantasy.The Best Mistake grabbed at your heart strings right off the bat. Wish every single Mom could find a guy like Coop. Nora's description and character fill-out is marvelous. Laugh a little; cry a little. This was a 1994 story and hit its mark.You wont be able to put it down.
2,A Bit Dissapointing,"I must say I was dissapointed with those 2 stories. First story is so far from reality (I know, I know, sometimes we want to get away-but not That Far!!!) I couldn't read even half of the 2nd story...It was written very poorly. Sometimes I felt like something just wasn't enough, at times opposite - like it was way too much! Anyway, I wouldn't recomend bying this book..."
3,Okay,"Nora Roberts' early work is just not that good...its an enjoyable afternoon read if you pick it up at the library (actually its great beach reading), but I wouldn't pay for it. The plots are typical romance...nothing new or exciting here and unlike her later work the plot isn't in depth or exciting."
1,Not the translation I would recommend,"As a teacher, I cannot recommend this translation. The Victorian style may be elegant (as one reviewer suggested) but its overly flowery presentation can get between the reader and the subject, making Catherine sound like she was perpetually floating above the ground instead of living as a citizen of her time who was seeking to know God and live in a very practical manner in the world. The contrast between this translation and the one done by Dr. Suzanne Noffke is marked and I highly recommend the latter instead."
1,weak plastic bracket,The plastic base weakens in the sunlight and braks off. I have two of these lights and each broke within a couple of years.
3,Not a very pratical toy,"My daughter recieved this as a birthday gift and I think she may have ridden it twice. It doesn't cost that much, so I guess if you are looking for something small to take on a trip or something it would be great for those little ones with lots of energy. Unfortunately, every time we got it blown up for my daughter to ride it, which, by the way took a long time for us to do that, it seemed to get another hole in it. Anyways, we still have it, but it's just one of those long forgotten, never purchase again toys that stay in the back of the closet!"
4,Going on almost 3 years ....,"Come this christmas (2002) it will be 3 years since my sister bought this for my nephew. At three he still plays with it, trying to get us adults to walk around with it between our legs as if we're riding it. However his will soon have to make it's way to the garbage as it doesn't hold the air anymore."
4,Solid Entry,Overall a solid mix of rock country and pop. Very listen-able. I have already recommended this to several friends who also bought and enjoy this CD
5,Jason is a god!,"Jason Isbell is a god. Sirens of the ditch is timeless and soulfull and in the pocket.The DBT 19 song release is noisy dirty and repetitive. God bless that mess.Jason is classic and pertinant.By the way, don't miss the special itunes cut: Whisper. I don't know why it ain't on the album. It is HOT.Lovin it, Donna"
2,Moderately Appealing,"This disc has some decent songwriting and overall, it's a good listen. But the general feel of the album is amateurish and poorly produced. There are parts where instruments seem to pop out of nowhere. One song ends with a sustained guitar chord that cuts out and then back in. It's like the player accidentally hit his pickup selector and then switched it back. And throughout the album, the vocals float above the mix in a rather distracting manner. You can definitely 'hear the studio' in this mix.The guitar work rarely rises above mediocre and some of it is down rightunfortunate. All-in-all, I'd pass on this one and wait for the next effort from this promising, but immature artist."
1,Fantastic!!!,"Brilliant song writing! Echoes of Drive by Truckers yet still very original! Best album I've heard this year! Jason made the right decision to leave DBT's otherwise we made not have had the pleasure of this excellent début solo album. Hope there's more where that came from! Well done Jason, can't wait for a UK tour!!!!"
1,why buy from this guy,just getting around to this review. when I purchased the cd it was worthless and I set is aside and forgot about it. I just ran across it and decided to take minute and put the sellers poop in the street. it is a train wreck - won't even play poorly. buyer beware
4,A Brilliant Debut!,"Jason Isbell is wise beyond his years and one hell of a guitar player. He writes intelligent songs that contain absolutely NO BS! His work with the Drive By Truckers would have been an excellent musical contribution for a young artist. ""Sirens of the Ditch"" is the next level for Isbell and he proves that he is more than able to stand on his own. He delivers a classic album his first time out. A ""must own!"""
5,Repeat playing reveals a true gem!,"If you play this cd once you'll think it's a good effort. If you play it many times it'll grow like a weed around your brain...becoming a part of you. This young man has an old soul and it's showing itself thru this cd. No it's not American Idol music - and I use the term ""music"" loosely wheh refering to American Idol- but that's a good thing."
3,Good but not Great,"I absolutely LOVE the DBT,, and I had high hopes for Jason's solo effort. In the first 3 songs you can hear the influences of DBT. The first song could have come right off of a Blessing and a Curse.. The third song is the rockingest song on the CD and really showcases what I know Jason can do.. After that it gets really really slow.. Don't get me wrong ,, the songs are good.. Just not what I was expecting. The rockin Jason I had hoped for never showed up.. Much more of a slow country or slow bluesey feel."
3,I Was Hoping For More...,"I'm a HUGE Drive-By Truckers fan, and I came to this album with really high hopes. Maybe my expectations were too high. I don't want to be overly critical. Jason Isbell's first solo album has some terrific songs (Dress Blues and The Magician are among my favorites), but it also has it's fair share of misfires, and in the end it fails to cohere the way that a truly great album should."
5,isbell kills it--awesome album,not much to say other than buy this album as soon as possible. isbell is a master songwriter and it's nice to see him get an entire album to showcase it. fantastic.
2,At Home With Art Not Your Home,"Diving into this book, as an avid art collector, one might expect to learn how different people work with the art they possess. This book though is really for those who are stricly ardent and almost excessive collectors who like to jam pack their residences with works galore. What is missing from this text is a careful presentation of how many different types of people display their art. There is too much focus on furniture, collecting passions and interest, and not enough focus on ideas. Overall, I found this book to be somewhat mono-dimensional in the concepts portrayed of how others live with their art. More a picture of what the authors had preconceived than a search for the spectrum of ideas."
4,Story suspenseful but editing was poor,"The story was very good and suspenseful. I enjoyed the book very much and would recommend the book. The only problem was the editing for the ebook. At least half the book didn't have a period at the end of a sentence. If the beginning of each sentence hadn't been capitalized, it would have been very hard to read. There were many words misspelled as well.Patricia Potter has been together a good story with good characters. Hopefully, someone will go back and clean up the ebook version."
4,Love Story BUT,I have read all of Patricia Potter's books. I loved the story BUT did no one edit this book? I've never seen so many punctuation errors and misspelled words.
5,Intuos quality!,"I unfortunately lost my old stylus a year ago, so I finally broke down and got a new one. The classic pen is consistent (but of course), fits well in my hand, doesn't act up, etc. etc. My only quibble is that it's super lightweight, almost feels... cheap? That can't be right. Well, I guess I could dip it in lead, if it really mattered. Which it doesn't."
1,These brakes are crap!,"I bought both front and rear.... they make a lot of dust like others have stated in their reviews. Also, they make noise and don't come with grease."
4,good product,"I gave this product 4 stars, only because when unwrapped for Christmas, the small handle on the sugar bowl was broken off. I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my mom, who loves Fiestaware - I got a refund and purchased a new set, which was perfect! I was really pleased with the amazon staff for helping me get a new one and my money back for the broken one. My mom gave me the original set, I superglued the handle on and it looks almost brand new!"
1,"Coffee, tea, sugar and more sugar!","Sadly, I was VERY DISSAPOINTED by my Fiesta Covered Creamer and Sugar Set with Tray from Amazon Warehouse Deals. I guess if it is too good to be true...well, you know the rest. I know mistakes happen, but seriously- 2 sugar bowls? Did they not think I would notice? Yes, I was sent 2 sugar bowls and no creamer. After going to a good deal of trouble to get the ""twin set"" returned, I could only receive a refund. It was a total waste of my time:("
2,Not Pleased,I ordered this sugar/creamer with a butter dish -- ordered BOTH in Cream Color and they came in TWO DIFFERENT COLORS!! Sent the entire order back -- didn't want to risk two different colors again.
1,no cover to my covered creamer & sugar set...twice,"I love fiestaware and have never been disappointed, but I got this set for my birthday and there was no lid! I searched the bubble wrap several times thinking I must have missed the tiny thing, but it wasn't there. Mistakes happen, so I requested a replacement, and again, NO LID! I am returning the item."
2,Cute but poor design,"Let me start by saying that I love Fiestaware and always get a thrill out of buying a new piece for my collection. This set was no exception. I thought it would be nice to finally have a pretty everyday set so we could retire the diner-style sugar pourer and wouldn't have to pour our milk straight from the carton. Unfortunately the pieces are thoughtlessly designed. It is impossible to pour the cream without it dripping, no matter how careful we are, and the sugar bowl should have a cutout for the spoon. I'm giving two stars for it's utter cuteness, but this is a kitchen utensil and should be more functional."
2,Helped me beat the Inkblot test,"I read this *years* ago, and ended up sort of memorizing what to look for in the Rorschardt (spelling?) Inkblot test.I was Court-ordered to have a Psychological evaluation (aren't Ex-spouses *great*?) in Dec of 1998, and I think knowing what to say (and what *not* to say) in that portion of the test helped give me custody of my kids, rather than my insane ex-spouse.BTW: do NOT say you see a 'giant man stomping on you with big boots!'"
3,"Entertaining, but not the ""bare-all"" promised...","I bought this book in the 80s, and it was one of my favorites, until the sequels. Then, I found out just how much Poundstone really does NOT know. Without divulging too much info, let's just say I am a member of one of the organizations which he claims to know secrets about their initiation, and what he says is total BS. I was disappointed, and it made me question the authenticity of the earlier material."
2,Speculation about mostly irrelevant things!,"I enjoyed other, more recent, books by William Poundstone and I decided to try this. I was very disappointed. I am sure the fact that the book was written twenty years ago contributes to my disappointment: many subjects present only nostalgic value for some people and mostly outdated. Don't look for revelations - the author is mostly speculating on the subject (secrets mostly will stay secrets). In our time much more and better information could be found on the Internet. I gave it two stars just for some historical data that I found sometimes interesting."
4,Very interesting and entertaining.,"Out of the three ""Big Secrets"" books, this one is the best. ""Bigger Secrets"" and ""Biggest Secrets"" have some great stuff in them as well, but there is also a lot of ""so what?"" information in them. Perhaps a little ""padding"". The first book, though, has some great stuff. Especially entertaining are the items about things you find on money and the info on Disneyland. Defenitely worth the read."
3,you're buying one song,"2 unlimited is my favorite band. but this cd just cooked single song over and over, it's a good song. I'm not sure it's worth the tag price."
3,Thinking Tools for Kids: An Activity Book for Classroom Learning,Some good ideas for me to try in the classroom. The book does seem a bit dated to me.
3,Great! For a while...,"This microphone worked perfectly fine until one day while playing the American Idol game and in the middle of a song it just went flat, no sound being recieved from it at all. I am planing on buying a Logitech microphone instead."
1,Is it just me?,Maybe it's just me BUT no difference felt at all!! Back to square one trying to find something to help me with my cravings and urges.
2,not that great!!,when you take it you do not have an appt. but you can not do anything else. you are so wired!!
4,challenging,"i was shocked to read the (mostly) harsh reviews for this set. i had no idea lobos fans were so conservative. but i'll take this difficult-yet-rewarding work over, say. ""this time"", which is easily los lobos' most souless offering to date. ""dose"" recalls ""colossal head"" in its brave, funky experimentation; this sort of thing should be encouraged -- otherwise, we should all just listen to bryan adams, you know?"
5,Fulfills the promise of the first album,"I admire the willingness of artists to experiment with modes and styles of music that risk alienating a dedicated fan base. While I didn't think the first Latin Playboys CD worked completely, I respected the vision and courage. Dose is a more complete, successful implementation of the ideas and approach of the first album. Its dissonant harmonies and stylistic range will alienate many Los Lobos fans who, like the aliens who confront Woody Allen in Stardust Memories, prefer their ""earlier, funnier"" stuff. But Los Lobos fans who appreciate more demanding works like Kiko and Colossal Head might find this is just what they're looking for. If you prefer the Los Lobos of ""How Will the Wolf Survive"" and songs like ""La Bamba,"" I cannot recommend this album to you. This is a work that requires a listener open to a soundscape on the uncomfortable edge of music."
3,"experimental, but fun","The Latin Playboys are a side project of two of the members of Los Lobos, one of the more seriously underappreciated rock bands of the last 20 years. Getting together with two buds, Perez and Hildago create some offbeat and atmospheric songs that are more interested in sounds than rocking. And this is just fine.The album includes four instrumentals, one of which is very short, but the others are quite enjoyable. The balance of the songs are somewhat inconsequential in terms of lyrics, at least in relation to their best work, but a soundscape is created that is always interesting. I enjoy putting this disc into my changer as I drive around, and each time the changer picks one of these songs, my ears stand at attention. So that tells me the songs are sonically interesting.Buy this album or not? If you like Los Lobos, definitely. If you like offbeat music that doesn't sound like much else, yes. If you like NSYNC, how did you even find this review in the first place?"
1,"overblown ""artistic freedom""","Atlantic Records sure must be loose w/ their recording contracts. I don't see how this kind of drivel, regardless of the musicians' past records and reputations, could pass a demo test w/ stingy studio execs. This CD was simply self-indulgent and wasteful. Froom is incapable of just playing keyboards, w/out trying to overunderproduce a piece to the point of absurdity. Atmospheric just don't cut it if there's no compelling content to hold it up. And where's that killer guitar talent we know/knew in Hidalgo? Just a strange, disjointed, and goofy effort with no real payoff."
4,I can't believe people haven't written a review about this series,"The year is 4699 (boy that's way in the future). A young adventurer on a desperate mission sets off to find Captain Ahab and his crew of outlaw whale hunters. Only Ahab can save his home planet from the most horrific beast known throughout the universe: Moby Dick.Now people don't ignor this anime series, be interested!"
1,Not for me,I regret ever spending my money on it because I lost my entire documents and the company was demanding hundreds of dollars to recover it back. I do not recommend this or any flash drive with a backup plan.
3,"very big; except size, rest is great","Quite big size and in one of my laptop it doesn't fit as the USA slot position was quite awkward. But other than that, the product works well."
3,Need Driver For XP,It is not plug and play type of flash cards. It require installation of the driver which is available at Simpltech web site. The idea of flash cars is not to require installation however this is a major disadvantage. I would go with scandisk products next time.
2,"Works well, but does not wear well","I was looking for something cheap, and I found it. Sound quality is good, and people seem to understand me well despite noisy outdoor environments. However, I'm not a big fan of the fit. They have 2 rubbery pieces that you slip over the ear piece to fit in your ear. One is for the right ear, the other for left. I'd prefer a uni-ear design. Didn't really think about it, but having a button to answer and end calls is very handy. This head set does not have this.All in all, this was a $20 mistake, but I'm continuing to use since the sound quality (on both ends) is ok."
2,"Barely works, nasty feedback","Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone. They are incredibly cheaply made, and when my wife gave them a try she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call. Essentially unusable, unless we find some trick that we have missed so far. We ordered a Sennheiser PC120 to try instead."
4,Awesome For The Price,I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone. It has more than enough volume. It comes with both a right and left ear adapter. Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it. It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.
1,Buzzing,Have the exact model from several years ago. Very comfortable. Ordered another one and sent it back. The earpiece buzzed and distorted when listening. Not sure if it was a lemon or they changed the way they were made.
4,Great headset if you're not using a bluetooth headset,"I have tried all the bluetooth headsets out there and none of them all sound clear. The only one that I would consider using is the Jawbone. I got this in an Office Depot and haven't used any other headset since. Most people think I am on a landline because there is no echo and no static. Unfortunately, you just can't beat a corded headset."
3,This cd is by NO means whack!,"Alright, simple and plain...the greatest cd that the B.C.C crew came out with was ""Angels of Death"" by Representativz. The Representativz came out tight on their cd but all of the other B.C.C's came out lacking production on their albums. This CD came out pretty tight though because it reveals EVERYONE who was originally on the B.C.C and gave them a chance to shine. Every single song on here OTHER THAN number 5,6, & 7 had some tight beatz, tight lyrical hooks, and tight production. Only warning i have for anyone who listens to this cd for the first time is...STAY AWAY FROM TRACKS 5,6, AND 7!! PLEASE!!....N-e-wayz...y'all enjoy this cd. And cop that angels of death CD. AND I'M OUT.:-D"
5,BEATS AND RHYMES DESTROY THE WU-TAN CLAN ONCE AND FOR ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"BEATS : 10/10RHYMES :10/10Just listen to the 5th track and you will see who you have dealings with !!!Wu.Tan is not the rap's first family !!!These guys surpass the wu-tan under all profiles !!!Believe it !!! and God Bless !!!P.S.:Check up my rap listmania, just clicking on my nickname and clicking above my listmania.

There are dance beats and strong ones and lyrics just for the winning person in the life !!!"
2,bring along your math dictionary,"This book covers alot of ground and the table of contents had me really excited. However, one chapter into the book and the authors are using, without explanation, terms and symbols that will be foreign to most biologists. Moreover, they present practice problems for solution that have no analogue in the text. This book is probably great if you already know all the math. But, I respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer that it's a good source from which to learn about dynamical systems for the first time..."
2,you call this full size?,"I thought this was a joke when it came, its tiny ,very tiny. I mean for a deluxe its a waste of money. its like a baby toilet. my kids thought it was. really to call this a deluxe someone had to have been on wacky tobaky"
3,NO CLAMPS TO SECURE TO RV/BOAT :0 FAILED at 11mths,UPDATE: Closure/flush flap failed at 11mths with only light use. No way to repair it! Beware.OMG If you intend to use this in an RV or boat as the ad clearly states then be fully aware that there is no way to keep this thing secured to the floor without some Rube Goldburg engineering. I wouldn't want a full potti sliding around with my wife on it like a bad Chevy Chase vacation movie! :pThe jury is still out on how well it works although it is a step up from my prior eqt. I'll update whether it'll be adaptable to or not.
1,not worth the money,This was not worth the money. The description of the product glorified what it really was. The old one I had was 10 times better. This is cheaply made and I am sure would not have lasted very long. Returned it the next day. Annabelle
4,Poopin in the woods,"We bought this one to replace an older one. We needed more capacity.We got this one and it was missing a cap. We talked with the seller and they got the missing part right out. Works fine, holds a lot and the pump mechanism seems to be much better than the smaller older competetors brand. Time will tell!"
4,"Great Portable, Well Made and Sturdy","It's really a lot more substantial that I expected. Which, in a toilet, I suppose is a good thing.Nice and sturdy, no more or less than described, and very well made. It's a terrific item, although I think it is a little high in price. I think it's sort of funny that you can buy a camp stove to cook for $50, but have to pay $100 to ... well, you know. Great item, all the same.It works like this - The unit holds a fresh water tank. You pump the pump handle, to fill the bowl with water. Do what you need to do, and pull the flush handle. Everything goes down into the waste tank. When you see (from the indicator) that it needs emptied, you detach the waste tank (it's actually pretty civilized), attach the spout, and empty it.If you want a portable toilet, get this one. It's much more than ""a bucket with a seat on the top,"" and it's the best I have ever seen."
4,extremely heavy to empty when full,"I bought one of these thinking I wanted the largest capacity toilet. It holds A LOT but I realized my mistake when we got back from a trip and had to get it to the house to empty. My sis and I (both 50 years old/chubby) had great difficulty even with a hand truck and there was no controlling the sloshing as it went into the hopper. We laugh about it now but the whole house reeked until we got every splatter cleaned up! I know that I can only lift about 2.5 liquid gallons so am toilet ""down-sizing"" before our next trip. Works great, flush tank must be full in order to work or you have to do a little priming(oh joy in the middle of the night).I plan to get around this problem by just leaving the flushing tank empty and using a small spray/bottle of water/cleaner to rinse the bowl after using."
1,NOT Brown kraft,"We received the package in a timely manner. The product is the correct size, quantity, and quality, but not as described. These are manila envelopes, NOT brown kraft."
4,Sturdy,This is a well made product and is comfortable to wear. The only thing I think I would fault it on is the length of the string. If it were a few inches longer I would give it five stars.
4,Good Book with good ideas,"A lot of good ideas in this book. The planner section also breaks down the more suitable activities per type of sport, whcih is very helpful. Some of the ideas need a bit more creativity for figuring out what equipment to use."
1,Booooo,Very little substance. Maybe one chapter...Big words but lacks of merit...Unfortunately most of the contemporary architecture is as shallow as the content of this book...
1,Does not work with XP and there is no support,"This product crashes on all of the XP's that I have attempted to load it on and as far as I can tell it can not be made to work properly with XP-Home. I have called Data Becker and have sent emails to them concerning this issue and have contacted the German parent company - No response! Their Warranty reads ""DATA BECKER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PROFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU."" - Believe me, they mean this!"
2,cannot handle equations nicely.,If your documents have equations edited by MS equation editor. PDF producer cannot handle it nicely. Instead it leaves some ugly symbols on your created PDF files.
1,Get RoboPDF 3.0 instead,"PDF Producer is rather old, so you should check out RoboPDF 3.0 from eHelp software instead. They offer a free trial download on their website."
1,lack of support,"I installed the product on XP machine. Every boot I get dialog boxes about my new found hardware - printer. Tried remove / reinstall, same.Several requests for support to Data Becker have went unanswered. They do not care. They are selling (what is to me) a defective product and they do not care. They have my money and they will not support my product purchase. They do not care.You must never purchase Data Becker products. You must never allow your family or friends to purchase Data Becker products."
4,No problems here,"I have not had any of the problems (so far) as the other reviewers of this product (I must have a newer version, though I can't find a version number anywhere). I am running Win XP Professional and it was easy to load. It's also easy to use, except I wish it had its own icon in the tool bar of each Windows application (i.e., word) instead of going to the print button. But, it's cheaper than the Acrobat Professional and it does just what I need. I'm happy!"
3,Works well,"This software does a nice job of producing PDFs. If you can afford Abode Acrobat, this is a nice option."
2,SMALL book,I love reading For Better or For Worse and buy the new ones whenever I find one but this book was small in size and only had a few sentences on every other page. I want more reading and laughs for $7.00 a copy.
2,Baby Obsession.,"That's what this strip is all about, babies, babies, babies.And if April wasn't excessively cute and spoiled enough, Meredith already looks like a ""Bratz Babyz"" doll with her puffy lips and California-blonde curls."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Obviously I knew going in that this movie wasn't going to offer anything more than light low-brow entertainment, but it falls below average for it's niche. Even low-brow humour requires some degree of subtlety and context to work, and those things seem mostly absent in this movie. It's also disappointingly uneventful, so much of the movie is set in the one house where not much progresses. I was hoping the guys' schemes would involve some detours to introduce additional environments and characters, but it never happened. The movie is generally pretty dark too, drawing a lot of it's gags from murder attempts. I guess it's a black comedy, but it's not marketed as such. I think it's inconsistent about what it wants to be. Trust the 7 out of 9 negative reviews on this site and don't waste your time with this movie, unless you enjoyed Big Momma's House."
1,"IT SUCKS, Part II","Sorry I couldn't come up with a better punchline, but this movie doesn't deserve any original thought or ideas. Maybe its because there aren't any original ideas in this movie event. National Lampoon used to mean funny, now its french for crapola. Avoid this one at all costs!!! Watch Caddyshack II, Airplane II, yes even Xanadu three times each before you pick this booger one."
2,Totally different than Expected?!?!,i tot this would be a good or atleast decent movie and would have a few hotties lyk the one in the front of the dvd but she wasnt even shown that much & the story line and plot wasnt good at all! I do not recommend purchasing this movie at all. waste of ur money i gave it a 2star cuz of the gurl
2,non-standard dimensions,Be aware that this 24x24x1 Nordic filter is not the same dimension as most other brands 24x24x1 filter. It is considerably smaller than the 3M 24x24x1 filters that I have purchased in the past. This unusual size allows unfiltered air to seep around the filter into the furnace.
4,Works,"This product works great for trigger mechanisms and cleans in the small, impossible to reach areas of those assemblies. This is not a lubricant at all so there is no reason it would resemble WD40. This product is more characteristic of alcohol as it cleans and TOTALLY dries in less than a minute with the added benefit of a strong, ""blasting"" spray.Not a lubricant."
1,Action Cleaner ?,One almost gets the feeling this product is no different than a widely used lubricant called WD40 which is a fraction of the price.
3,"With or Without Consent, You WILL be bound","Restoring the Lost Constitution did a pretty good job at establishing the Presumption of Liberty which the courts ought to be employing when rendering their decisions. However, I disagree with the basic premise of the book which is that the Constitution is binding upon all in conscience, whether or not you consent to be governed. I think that if federal courts adopted Barnett's premise of adjudication then the results of the courts would be a lot more consistent. Many arguments over semantics and foundations of word meanings at the time the Constitution was adopted may be interesting for lexicographers and etymologists, but this really wasn't my bag."
2,Very repetitive,"Each chapter begins with a premise with supporting details which is then repeated, using different examples for the rest of the chapter. It reads like the author got paid by the word."
4,mystery thriller,Very scary and kept me reading on the edge of my seat. Opened my eyes to the underworld drug market and their business operations.
4,A wonderful love story; a scary mystery,"I am amazed at how a new writer could put together such an intriguing mystery, yet let the love of the lead character come through so believeably."
3,Bleach Kon 8 Inch Plush,I rate this product good because I like the description of this item. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for this particular good.
2,Not what I paid for,"I was not necessarily comfortable paying this much for an 8'' toy, but I have a Bleach fan in the house, so I thought it would we a welcome addition, even with the price. It arrived in fairly good time, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. However, the toy I paid for was the toy in the picture, and what I got was a somewhat cheap toy with loose seams and no character whatsoever. The toy is cheaply made, and I feel like the arms will come off any second. It's an expressionless toy, with no posing ability. It's essentially made of felt, which is not what was promised. I feel like I was cheated."
4,I likee,"The Kon was a lot smaller than I expected, but then again I kind of expected a Kon whose size was relative to the anime/manga. (I knew it would be around 8 inches, but I still expected a larger Kon..>.<)That aside, it's extremely sturdy, and the button is so cute!The mane on Kon is a bit flimsy though. As in, it doesn't stick out straight, so you have to bend it and fix it so the mane sticks out.Other than that, it's a Bleach Official Plush with a tag and all, so I'm pretty happy with it.(:"
4,The be all and end all in chinese cooking,this book has out-lasted the decades . . .it is still one of the best chinese cookbooks ever written. Just leave out the MSG. and enjoy!
5,The perfect mid-power rocket kit,"Instructions were very clear. The kit goes together with super-glue and a minimum of additional tools. The rocket is very well designed. I have put together a few Estes kits, but I learned a lot from this Aerotech one. The payload bay is nice to have. I do not recommend flying this on an E engine. TheSU Econojet 29mm F27-8R (2) HAZworked really well, as did an F25. This rocket can drift a ways if you launch it in wind. The reason I gave it a 4/5 for durability is that some of the parts are made of cardboard which dent easily if you're not careful and can fray at the edges with normal use."
4,Better than I expected,"I bought the CD basically for the title song, but the entire CD is excellent. It's good traveling music, if you're on the way home from work and need a little pick up. ""Standing Out In a Crowd"" is one of those songs that will grab you if you a miserable childhood (or if you thought you did.) I would recommend the CD."
5,Variety! - Back with a Bang....,"I have been a Trisha fan for many, many years now. I believe that she is one of the best vocalists around in any genre. She knows how to sing a song so that you feel the emotion of the songwriter. This album continues her superb interpretation. Just listen to the amazing ""Georgia Rain"" and tell me you don't feel the emotion. There's quite a bit of variety on this record - slow ballads, honky-tonk rockers, blues songs, even a song with a sort-of zydeco feel. Along with ""Georgia Rain"", my favorite tracks include ""Trying To Love You"", ""Try Me"" and ""Gimme The Good Stuff"". Welcome back Trisha...next time don't make us wait four years :)"
1,Lackluster,"I have waited so long for this CD and I was sickened when I popped it into my player the first day it went on sale. There is not a song on the entire disc that I could even remember the melody five minutes after hearing it. The exception being ""Georgia Rain"", of course, and that's only because radio has played it into the ground and sort of forced us to like it by default. Usually I find myself humming Trisha songs for weeks after hearing them but not this time. Maybe this is just a warm-up for the real thing. Hopefully she'll be back with her soaring ballads on a new CD very soon now that she's back in the music mode. I'm truly bummed. Trisha is my all-time favorite singer but she sure didn't rise to the occasion this time."
5,Classic Trisha,"Her countriest-sounding album since her debut, Jasper County ranks up there with the greatest Trisha Yearwood albums. The album is the perfect mix of heartache, introspection, and just plain fun. But it is not some jarring departure: the best of the more adult contemporary Trisha shows up in ""Standing Out In A Crowd."" Those craving Trisha ballads in general will not be disappointed. Highly recommended."
1,Falls short...,"This album falls short of Trisha Yearwood's incredible voice. Besides ""Georgia Rain,"" the only other track I enjoyed was ""Who Invented the Wheel"" and then the rest got boring. This is pretty much a boring album."
2,very average,"Trisha Yearwood is a good vocalist,but this Album is just another lite feeling record from Her. Production is alright nothing much there. the Song selection doesn't match Her Vocal Talents at all.""Georgia Rain"" is a Nice cut,but beyond that everything else is hit&alot of miss to me on a whole.she reminds me of alot of Artists in all styles of Music who can't connect there Talent with the Right Writing or Music.when it all comes as One,then it's something else."
2,Not Up to Standard Yearwood,"Things started off great, ""Georgia Rain"" is classic Yearwood and yet sorry to say one of the few great moments on this cd. The other song that really hit me was ""Trying to Love you"" but the blance of the cd songs like ""pistol"" and ""It's Alright"" are nothing special. Yearwood still sounds great, but all in all far from her best."
3,UNDERWHELMING UNFORTUNATELY,"I am a big fan of Trisha Yearwood but this CD is just not up to snuff. I love Georgia Rain but even it loses something with repeated listens. I can't quite figure out if it is the writing or her reading/singing of these songs but something is missing. Who Invented the Wheel, Pistol and Standing out in a Crowd are just YUCK, the messages are trite and maybe she knows this and her singing is like ""this song sucks"" but I will give it a try. I give her three stars more for who she is than the product she released here. Trisha has been very inconsistent with her last few CD's hope she gets a little more passionate and hits more home runs than singles!!!"
4,BEST Female Vocalist,"While Martina and one or two others may give Trisha a run for her money in the belting-it-out department, no one comes clothes to the richness, depth, and emotion she gives to her songs. 'Georgia Rain' is a simple, beautiful ballad about young love. 'Trying to Love You' is an equally beautiful song about the complexities and hardships of relationships. 'Pistol' and 'Sweet Love' are at the other end of the spectrum....sassy,sexy numbers with a honky-tonk style. Trisha does it all so well. This CD is one you'll play again and again.I Also Highly recommend SONGBOOK - a 5-star collection of earlier hits."
2,No love for the fans,I am a big fan of Trisha's music so I bought this CD the first week it came out. I played it once or twice but it just didn't click with me the way her others did. Of course now that she is married to Garth Brooks she has to employ the same marketing gimmicks that he does to get people to buy the same CD more than once. It really irritates me when artists do not take their fans into consideration and add a song to a CD after hundreds of thousands of people have already bought the CD. It's not like you can just buy the one song on iTunes because it's not available. This will most likely be the last CD I ever buy from her. I stopped buying Garth Brooks' music after he re-released every CD he'd ever recorded with a new song on it or with new cover artwork. Enough is enough... artists need to stop making their money off the backs of the working people who need to buy the same CD's multiple times to get the songs they hear on the radio.
1,I was not impressed,"The only song worth listening to on this cd is ""Georgia Rain"" the rest of it couldn't even interest me. I took it back to the store the next day. I was so dissappointed in this album and I couldn't wait for it to come out. The lyrics to some of the songs were good like ""Trying to Love You"" and ""River of You"" but the music was all wrong. The song ""Who Invented the Wheel"" is just dumb and I couldn't believe it was choosen by her after all the great songs she has done in the past. I stick to her greatest hits albums since that's the only kind cd that has any good material on it."
4,GrownUpMusic.com recommended!,"The new Mrs. Garth Brooks has a few words for Faith Hill: ""Step aside."" Yearwood takes her time with a record to get it right, and this all-country pleaser has all the ingredients for success: smart, upbeat tunes, a fiddle here/a mandolin there, and best of all, that incredible voice. Yearwood fans are going to love the true-country flavor that lasts and lasts. That's what separates Yearwood from many of her contemporaries (hubby included). Her records never sound dated or old. ""She's in Love with the Boy"" is still as fresh as it was back in 1991."
4,Trisha sounds better than ever,"I was so happy to see Trisha Yearwood finally released a new album. Her voice sounds as exceptional as ever on these tracks. There are a few beautiful songs here, such as ""Who Invented the Wheel"", ""Georgia Rain"", ""Trying To Love You"", ""River of You"", and ""Sweet Love"". Unfortunately there are a lot of mediocre songs on this album that I found disappointing. As has been said by some other reviewers, I would expect Trisha to be able to find some top material and not so much of this 'filler'. I also have to give this album a 4 rating instead of a 5 because of the length. 38 minutes is not acceptable these days, in my opinion, and the album could have used 2 or 3 more tracks. But based on Trisha's splendid voice, the emotion she shares with her audience, and the good songs that are on the album, I am rating ""Jasper County"" 4 stars."
3,Great voice/Mediocre Songs,"Like most of you, I have also been a Trisha Yearwood fan for years and have seen her live as well. I expected better songs after waiting four years for this new cd. Trisha sounds great as always, and I do enjoy the diversity of the cd. However, there are only about 3 songs that are really pretty good, the rest are unfortunaltey very average. They just don't have those great melodies we're so used to hearing from Miss Yearwood."
1,Stupid Lyrics,"All the songs have inane lyrics, like the one about cars. All of the songs really sound awful and so, although I like Trish, this album is just not good."
3,"Could have been a bit more personal, but captures true feeling","Filled with a nice mix of sass and emotion, Yearwood sings her way through JASPER COUNTY with relish. There is nothing particularly outstanding just a solid performance from a good singer. I wish it could have been a bit more personal in execution, but that's often tough when you don't write your own material. But the overall feeling is of someone who is happy with where they came from, and makes for a nice listening experience."
5,"Great baby book, more detail than most","If you really want to record a lot about your baby, this is a GREAT book. I got my first one as a baby gift for my first daughter, but I liked it so much that I bought another one for my second baby. It goes into each month pretty in-depth, which turned out to be a good reference for when I had my second daughter (what was my first daughter eating at 6 months? When did my first daughter start sleeping through the night exactly?).I've gone back through them both to reminisce. It's very thorough and includes a place to write a letter to your baby, a journal for yourself or whatever you want to record, holidays, gatherings, milestones, etc. I guess the only bad thing would be if you really disliked writing, you may not want to get this book."
4,Beautiful book.,"I ordered this book while I was in the final months of pregnancy. I should have bought it sooner. The layout is very simple and neat. There is also a lot of space to write down special moments and for journal keeping as well. The author also gives suggestions as to things you may want to write down in case you can't think of anything. But, hey isn't every moment in baby's first year special?"
3,Not like the average Baby Memory book,"This book is okay but it gets to be repetitive. I felt they could have included a little bit more detailed questions to be answered but it's very basic. If you're little for a book with more dept, colors, humor, and something others will be inspired by when they read it than this isn't the book for you."
4,Urn Burial,Not much as a mysteery but great as a fun read. The lifestyle Phryne has and era in which she lives are the really fun things here. Because of the latter theses books are always worth reading.
4,One of the better stories,"A creepy old mansion, murders, and spooky caves--what could make a better story?! I admit I've always had a ""thing"" for caves, and these sound particularly fascinating. Aside from the great story, though, there's the usual selection of lost capital letters, comma splices, and the like. Sigh. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars."
3,western fantacy,The book is a western with larger than life heroes that can allegedly shoot the eyes out of pigeons with a pistol as well as other unusual abilities. A kind of lackluster book.
5,Great Tool For Everything,I love this tool. It works great. I took it snowboarding and it came in handy for my friend when he needed to adjust the board. It even worked when I was out with my dad and he jammed the hinge on the door so it came it handy. I guess one important thing is that you have to have it on you.
5,A Fun Tool for Tech Geeks!,"I really do use this for working on PCs. Much easier and more convenient way to carry a tool kit around.Construction is top-notch, as you would expect in a Swiss Army knife. There are the odd tools on it I am not sure I would ever use, like the gear hook. But it has what you need to get the job done for PC repair and upgrading.Very highly recommended."
2,Long on problems; Short on answers,"J.D. Kleinke uses 90% of the book to describe the woes of the US healthcare system. The tone is very very negative and the author uses words such as ""moronic"" way too much. It is tiring to read so much unbalanced negativism. The critique may be warranted but is not properly structured; there is a lot of focus jumping from anecdotes about payers, providers, government, consumers, consultants, etc. Kleinke even tries to explain the problems using Complexity Theory about which he clearly knows nothing. (Attempting to draw analogies between our healthcare system and sets of stiff differential equations). In the last 10% of the book Kleinke presents a solution that he does not tell how could ever be implemented. It is a combination of old utopic ideas. In short, buy this book only if you need more reasons why our healthcare system is broke."
1,Author Full of Himself; Weak Analysis and Bombast,"Disappointing book from someone whose beliefs about and analyses of the U.S. health care system are all over the map. While admittedly a decent writer, Kleinke can't deliver. The book is full of weak analysis, arguments that despite their cleverness don't hold together, and bombastic statements. Author is so full of himself and so all over the place that he seems unstable. Don't waste your money or your time on this book."
1,The Myths of Kleinke,"Total opportunist, Kleinke has changed his tune 100 percent since his last book. Whatever sells is what he wants to sell; he sold a lot of his last book; in this new book, he provides a crazy critique that is full of utopian ideas that are of no help to anyone working in the health care system today. Some amusing anecdotes, but it seems Kleinke is more in love with his own writing and storytelling than in providing any useful insights."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this book,"If you buy and read this book, you will feel sick that you spent the money and the time on it. The author has done a complete flip-flop from his earlier book, but that's not all that is wrong with this book. While it has gathered some interesting points together, it leaves one with no useful recommendations and frankly, the author seems to have completely lost it. It's no wonder this book isn't popular. All song and dance, and no substance."
5,Twinkle copper polish,"This product is still the only one I've found which does such a fine job with so little effort on my copper pots. All of my Revere Ware is kept in plain view in my kitchen, so having the bottoms of the pots sparkle is important. Twinkle has kept them gleaming for the 40 years I've used it. I'm so glad it's still available."
4,Superior in music AND lyrics!,"I stumbled across this CD through the web site here. I had never heard of Iain Matthews, but ordered the CD anyway. It is great! Besides being forward, well produced music, it has lyrics that really make you listen. An excellent choice for any folk music fan!"
3,Not That good as people say,"this cd is not all that good, sure there a few songs that are tight like 2,4,9,19,20 but its not that great. If u want a good no limit compilation then check out down south hustlas :bouncin and swingin"
4,VERY GOOD SOUNDTRACK,"THIS IS THE BEST S.T. FROM THE LIMIT CLAN.""DOWN&DIRTY""IS BY FAR THE BEST SONG ON THE CD FROM MY POINT OF VIEW."
3,all bout it,"overall sndtrk is cool, but why the hell is RIDE 4U only on this album?other than that, its all good.but does anyone know where i can find my #1 song RIDE 4U #17 on the sndtrk?"
4,Pictures are needed,"Dear Web-rider, This book has a incredible text and the clinical topics are too, but the pictures are dificult to associate with the practise classes and to read the text."
2,NOPE,"Not a great book. Pictures and diagrams are subpar at best, I would not recommend buying this book to anyone."
3,Very Heavy Material,This book was a little banged up and it's very heavy reading material. Be prepared to sit and focus for a while!
2,Not the best,I've taken more than one anatomy course. If your professor assigns you this. Save yourself the headache and find another anatomy book to cross reference with.
2,"Decent text, horrible pictures","If you have a choice, do not get it. I ended up supplementing with dozens of books from the library. Just to understand what they are talking about. Or ask instructor to use different pic in lecture handouts."
4,Great new 2010 4th Edition but advertised online access not available yet!!,"This is a great streamlined anatomy text that gives the key take-home points. The info is sufficient for most except of course the masters and PhDs in anatomy! The only downside is that, as of the date of this review, the access to the online book is not up and running yet (i.e. with the scratch code). I wrote to the customer service (thePoint) about this but have had no response in two weeks. So if you are buying this book to access it online be aware. Not sure when it will be ready."
5,Just get it,WIth this book and Netter's you will have everything you need in anatomy. This book is also EXCELLENT for your surgery rotation in third year. Older versions are always smarter in anatomy . . . things haven't changed much in anatomy in say . . . a couple million years.
5,thank you,"I recieved my book in a timely manner, and without damages. I appreciate the ease of purchase and the timely delivery of my order. Thank you, and keep up the great work.P.S This book is a must have for Graphic Artists! :)"
1,Worst book I've read in a long time,"Don't waste your money. The book is tiny, the story transitions so badly that I had to keep re-reading pages to try and make sense of it, and it is so poorly edited that a 3rd grader must have done it. I'm not a book snob - any book will usually do, but not this time. Sure, the STORY is okay. But when you have 20 sets of quotations back-to-back with no identification of who is saying what, it gets confusing. Then you read it again and realize that the author threw a 3rd person into the conversation somewhere in the middle. Overall, it was a short book with a terrible flow."
1,JohnR,IVISTA no longer exists. It was either sold or bought up by another product. This product is completely worthless since it is based on the Web Servers which no longer are supported.
2,Not that handy,"Not exactly what I expected. The fold is a bit akward, though it stores nicely. Fork portion of the spork is dispraportionate to the spoon section making it very hard to use as a fork."
3,Expensive,"I think the product should be cheaper. I would not recommend it for the lunchroom, because I think other portable utensils would be better. However, I think it is probably really useful for hiking, which is what it was intentionally designed for."
4,Good but could be designed a little better,"I purchased this from a store and immediently used it the next day on a camping trip. It is compact and weighs practicaly nothing, but, when I use it, it keeps collapsing on me. Im not trying to cut through a steak with it, mostly just camp fire food, so its not a big deal. But it could of been designed a little better. Other than that, its fine. If you dont force it, it will stay together while you eat."
1,Crap folding spork,I now unfortunately own this POS and the far superior Optimus folding spork. The Brunton one is crap. It came loose so that when you pushed the bar down to tighten nothing happened. I bought it because of the backpackers choice endorsement. The quality control must have changed or the Optimus one was not out when reviewed. Besides the issue of the spork not working (a big issue) it is slightly smaller than the Optimus one and the handle does not fold around the back of the spoon so it does not sit as tightly together.Do yourself a favor buy the Optiums one. I will be.
4,"Great, high-quality stripper",These things are great. Bought to make re-wiring the boat easier. This also works good on household electrical cable as well.
5,Outstanding,"This is equally as good as the other Ice Age movies. This is a movie you can enjoy with your children or grand children and really laugh together. I do hope there are more of these films in the future. Good story, great writing and fabulous animation."
3,"Great movie, terrible value","My children greatly enjoyed Episode Three in the ongoing saga of Ice Age and indeed it is probably the best so far, being funny and clever and very tight. There is plenty of visual humor, verbal humor, and situational humor and very little is over-played (though the birthing scene comes close to being working the joke too much). So the movie itself is a great addition to the family's DVD or BluRay collection. But this particular DVD double-pack is a shameless confidence trick. The ScratPack disc is utterly without merit. There are no new animated sequences and most of it is tedious in the extreme. It looks as if it took someone eight minutes to compile, though that might be exaggerating the effort and thought that went into it. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to buy this double-pack; just go for the movie alone."
1,Just a misleading and meager 'special edition' of Ice Age III,"This rating does not reflect my opinion of the 'film part' of this Pack but the Pack itself, of which the second DVD is called ""The Scrat Pack"" for no other reason than that it contains a couple of old short Scrat films and that's about it. A very cheap marketing trick to make you pay 50% more. Buy the film!"
3,"The ""Actual"" Movie was good, waste of packaging too...","The third movie was good. I saw it in the movie theater in 3D and that was really neat. (Too bad the DVD couldn't be 3D). It was a real waste of money to get the Double DVD pack because the extra DVD that came with it only had about 3-5 minutes of new stuff on it and the rest you can find on the previous DVDs (the first two movies) as Special Features. I was very very disappointed. It was old stuff with one or two new ones and then the history of how Scrat came to be. Interesting if you are into the cartoon and movie creating business, but most people don't want to watch 10-20 minutes of that stuff."
3,Don't buy both!,"The Dawn of the Dinosaurs was great but the ""scrat pack"" wasn't worth the extra money~"
3,Hope you have a stomach for this,"I am only giving this three stars after reading just a small portion of this book. I appreciate the author's honesty and attempt to communicate the horrors some of us face in this world, but after reading a chapter or two of her descriptive story, I had to put it down. You really need a stomach to read about the abuse that was endured to her as a child. I couldn't do it, and had trouble sleeping. Made me sick to my stomach. I can't pick up this book again."
4,Book Review,"I have not finished reading this book but am in the process. So far, it is well written in much detail with supporting documentation included. I was curious about government mind control and this gives much more information than I ever imangined. If you are interested in some of the things our government is involved in without the people's knowledge, read this book."
1,statement of retraction,I wish to retract my previous endorsement of this book as I cannot vouch for it's accuracy or integrity.
5,This book deserves a HUGE audience - read it & pass it on!,"Anyone who dismisses the contents of this book as outlandish and unbelievable simply doesn't want to admit it's possible. Just because we are horrified at such evil, doesn't mean it isn't second nature to those in control. It's happening - wake up! The emperor has no clothes, and more Cathy O'Briens (and AMERICANS) need to stand up, speak out and say so!I thought James Traficant was on our side until I read this book...and I always had a bad feeling about C&W music - now I understand why - I'll never look at either one the same way again."
1,"Tragic, but possibly therapeutical prose","I've no problem beleiveing that the author was the victim of some horrendous abuse.But the rest of the book is clear nonsense. Sure there might be some mind control experiments - I'd be astonished if there was none - but you'll have to suspend reality to believe this stuff.An..hold on, that's the door, strange for someone to be calling at this time of day..."
5,Disturbing,"This is possibly the most disturbing book that I have ever read, and I have read over 1000. Some of the claims seem to be unbelievable, but I ask myself why haven't the people implicated in the book sued for libel. The copy I purchased was in it's 14th printing. One would think that it would have been discontinued long before that if it were not true."
5,TranceFormation of America,Book arrived on Time the print is very small but the content very interesting-Cathy had courage to write what she knew at the risk of her life. Its an honor to read something that has taken a courage few would comprehend.
1,Total disinformation,"After watching part of their 1996 lecture at granada forum I had to look their names up so I can check out their book. And the first link in the search results happens to be one that proves that Mark is a liar, being used to spread disinformation and lead people seeking the truth about these sex crimes in the wrong direction.Please read through this entirely before making your own judgements.[...]"
1,Rationality Please,"What is unbelievable to me is the fact that people have actually read this book and taken it seriously. I am shocked by how people accept irrational claims as fact. It seems those who support the claims in this book fancy themselves as critical thinkers who have made an attempt to question the answers. However, thinking critically involves examining the claims of others and rationally separating fact from fiction. Once you have allowed yourself to accept certain claims on the basis that these claims seem to be allowing you to enter into a realm of awareness, you have faltered as a rational being. For those who have given this book a positive review, I suggest you re-read at least one page of the book and re-think the validity of these claims."
1,In my opinion this book was a waste of time and money.,"Ah yes, ""TRANCE""---if you are into filthy, preposterous, garbage, this book's for you!!! Personally, I feel I wasted my time and money, as I must admit, I let my curiosity supersede my better judgment on this one. Although, I must say, after awhile it starts to get humorous as to the lengths these two authors will go to keep the reader from dozing off! And finally, it seems the only two individuals the authors leave with their reputations intact are Buddy and Socks or did I miss something???"
3,pornography by and for paranoid schizophrenics,"Highly entertaining, absurd rubbish. You can read summaries of both this book and ""Brice Taylor""'s (Susan Ford) _Thanks for the Memories_ (omigosh! They corroborate each other!) in Adam Parfrey's _Apocalypse Culture II_. If you thought the Meese Commission report was hilarious, if you think Texe Marrs and David Icke are absurd to the point of humor, then you might like these, too.If you believe these tales, though, I suggest you seek professional help in the form of a critical thinking class at your local college or university."
4,The Last Farewell & Other Hits,This is a very good album with many of the hits that are still carried over to the later albums. (This was released in 1974.) The songs that were not hits are still very enjoyable. I only wish it had more than nine songs. I have seen Roger Whittaker in concert twice and the songs on this album are always saved for the end. They are the crowd pleasers.
4,A Classic Beach Book,"Okay...The A-List, Girls on Film was a really good beach book. While reading it I really enjoyed it. The writing is decent and the charecters are really fun to get to know. If your looking for a book with sex, lies, and backstabing then you will love this book. Get it and have FUN with it..."
3,thank god there's gonna be a 3rd,"I thought the entire thing was really slow. Adam as a character is kind of boring, so I found myself just kind of sighing while she deliberated between the ""good"" boy and the ""bad"" boy. Always go for the ""bad"" boy in fiction, duh :)The last scene was the best, basically because Ben is so much more interesting, then say Sam and her lesbian tendancies which were portrayed sort of creepily with no explanation.Then there's the whole ""pregnancy"" with Dee that COULD have been made interesting and was just a foot note and explained out in a paragraph.For the third I hope there's a lot more Cammie and a LOT more Ben"
5,SO MUCH BETTER THAN GOSSIP GIRL!!!,"I was quite a fan of the GG bks, but I've found a new love and it's THE A LIST books. GIRLS ON FILM was even better than the first book. It's well written and treats readers as if they have a functional brain. Plus Anna Percy is a huge root-for and there really isn't anyone to root for in the GG series. The wish list stuff (designer this and that) is fun to read about, but it's the characters that really grab me. In this book you learn a lot more about all the main characters, and the ending is incredibly romantic! I can't wait to get my hands on book 3. And 4 and 5 and more... This is the closest pop fiction to real lit I've ever read. Zoey Dean is a fabulous author and I just loved this book!!!"
4,Much Better,"A-list #2:Girl on Film is definately an improvement from Ms.Dean's first A-list novel, ""The A-list"". While I didn't really care for the whole Anna/Adam Anna/Ben thing I did like that the character Sam is starting to develop some personality & I think I'm going to like her newfound friendship with Anna.Anna's sister Susan was great guest character which gave Anna a bit more depth and the argument she & Anna have near the end is done beautifully. Something about this book that annoyed me was Cammie. I absolutely that girl and she should just get this stupid vendetta with Anna over with because it gives really no personality at all.Like I said before a much better improvement from the first book, and I think Ms.Dean has a pretty strong hold of the book already, where I felt it took Ms.Von Ziegesar 3 books into the series of Gossip Girl before she could do something decent with her characters.Good work Ms. Dean & keep it comingCiao"
4,Awesome if you love twists and turns with love stories,"At first I thought that the A-List series was a typical boring girly hollywood book, but after this one I am hooked! Definitely check this out if you like sweet valley high. it is like a modern version of it. Anna Percy is very interesting to read about. I am looking forward to reading the third and fourth installment."
5,Great Follow Up For The A- List,"Girls on Film by Zoey Dean was another great novel. Zoey did a great job on the second novel in this series. In this novel Anna works with Sam Sharpe on a school project film on the Great Gatsby. During which so, Anna discovers her screen-writing talent. Susan, Anna's sister leaves rehab to come stay with her, but during her stay, Cammie convinces her to drink and she ends up going to a party drunk, but luckily Anna's new friend, Sam, helps her, by telling veryone it was for a movie. Anna also forgives Ben after what he did to her and they get back together. This was another great book by the bestselling author Zoey Dean"
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,"i love the a-list novels sooooo much! omg their so realistic and i love how they have things that are in our everyday lives. like for example instead of writing ""the red car"" zoey dean writes ""the red mustang"" omg in this whole book i kept hoping ben and anna would get together and the end was so romantic!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Pretty Good,"This book was pretty good. It starts out as kind of boring but the end is really good because it has a lot of ""action"" um sort of. Basically it kind of went really fast and i can't wait for the next book. Definitley a read if you read the first one."
3,An ok follow-up to a mediocre series,"In my opinion, the A-List is a bad copy of Gossip Girl, but I needed a fix...so I bought this book. It's ok...though GG is still way better! I think it focuses too much on Sam, and eventually gets boring."
3,Slightly disappointed,"This book wasn't nearly as edgy, captivating, or fun as the first. The thin plot did keep me reading, but I wasn't left nearly as satisfied as I was with the first book."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,THIS BOOK IS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.THE BEST PART OF THIS BOOK IS WHEN TIPPY AND CASH COME UP.
3,to contradict the commernt of another flop by diana palmer,"Just to make clear to the reviewer of another flop. Cash and Tippy have a book that concludes their story it's called Renegade and was published in July 2004. Furthermore, I enjoy Diana Palmer's writing style. I love the humor and melodrama found within her books. The book is a quick lifetime movie(in a good way)without the bad acting. It is funny, sad, and endearing the way of all Palmer's books. I am looking forward to her new book in December Night Fever."
2,Disappointed :(,"I love Diana Palmer. She's one of my favorite writers. However, this book left me disappointed. One reviewer mentioned it and I'll mention it again - He never said he loved her! I even flipped back a few pages to see if I missed something. Nope. He never said it. From their previous mention in other novels I was really looking forward to their story. It was quite upsetting not to have the great story I know that Diana can write!"
2,Wheres the hero?,"Typical romance by Diana Palmer. Violet is a strong character, unlike a lot of the females in the other books. However, the male character in this one comes up extremely short. He has no attractive attributes whatsoever. He's selfish, caught in the past, and unwilling to do his part to make the relationship work. It seems like he cares about his pet cats more. Even to the end, he makes Violet settle for a measly relationship."
4,Ending is disappointing,"I was curious to see how others liked the ending of this book and I see that many readers are saying what I felt too. . . .the ending wasn't truly a happy ending. The hero in the book, Blake Kemp, doesn't tell Violet that he loves her. It is a small point but one that sticks out. As another reader did too, I went back and re-read the ending and nothing is said.The story itself was very good and I like Blake and Violet as a pair. The ending leaves you wishes for a little more permeance."
3,Good continuation to the series....,"If you have read all the ""Long, Tall Texans"" books, then Boss Man will make perfect since to you. This one is the continuation to Cattleman's Pride, so there was a lot of repeat information from that story in this book. I was glad to read the new saga on Blake and Violet, even though Blake's attitude toward Violet seemed misplaced most of the time. (Tipical D.P. writing) I found most of the funniest reading to be about his cats...Mee & Yow, I would like to see the human characters with some of the personalites that Blake's cat's showed. I am looking forward to the next story and finding out what happens with Duke & Beka Wright."
1,Don't Bother!!!!!!!!!,"What a waste of my time and money! This author is living in a time warp! If you have another title, just change the names and you'll have a new book. How does she get away with submitting the same crap to the publisher?Palmer's male characters are gods gift to women and get away with treating women like trash. The women are so fiesty, they put their men in their place with witty responses like ""you, beast!"" ...Blah, Blah, Blah............."
4,Boss Man~Cute,I enjoyed this book. It was a cute story. It tied up alot of questions that continued thru other books. I loved the two cats & how Violet won them over.
1,Isn't this supposed to be romance?!!,"I've read quite a few Diana Palmer books. Which is the reason I continue to buy them even though I haven't enjoyed many of them recently. Every leading man seems to have a ""women hater"" syndrome. What the heck is that and why would someone want a man like that?!!! Our leading lady like many others from previous Palmer books is insulted and put down over and over and over and over (get the point?!). But still continues to wait with longing in her heart for her leading man. Well let me just say ""Give me a break!!"" I do NOT recommend this book!"
2,Did I miss something?,"I have come to wonder if Ms. Palmer has a ghost writer based on the fact that some of her book are really really good (ei Lord of the Desert, Paper Rose, Once in Paris etc.) and then I read a book like this one and have to wonder if it's been written by the same person. I really dislike this book because it brought up people from other books who's story has already been told and a happy ending was given (ei Libby, Cash, Tippy Jordon). BTW Did He ever tell Violet he loved her? I read the whole thing and must have missed it!!! LOL"
1,Does she have an editor???,"This is a question I have had for quite some time. Ms. Palmer has long been a favorite author, however, the older I grow, the more antiquated her dialogue becomes. Also, in book after book, continuity is a LARGE problem for Ms. Palmer. Does she forget what she has written from the day before? Also, is she so out of touch with today's youth that she truely thinks they still use words like ""swell"" and ""dishy""? Come on, Diana, if you are going to continue to write, then please try to keep up with the jargon of today. I applaud the high moral standards she continues to give her heros and heroines, but just because you are a ""throwback"" to another time doesn't mean you will express yourself like a 50's television show. I agree with the request of another reader for Ms. Palmer to take a step back and look for the magic that she had when she wrote Amelia, Nora, and Diamond Spur. By the way, in case there is some confusion, Night Fever is a reprint from back in the early '90's."
4,great book_,I love Diana's books! Her books just seam to flow. She always writes a good story!When you want to relax to a good book; read Diana's books!
5,Very Spirited,Another great CD by Dave Koz and Friends - he seems to have alot of them! This CD really gets you in the Holiday Spirit.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I usually love the music and styling and Dave Koz. I expected this to be exactly what the title said --- Smooth jazz, but it's more an assorted mix of styles. I played it one time, ended up burning the 3 titles I did like to a Christmas CD, and will probably never listen to the original CD again."
2,A Disappointing Christmas Album,"This album is filled with inconsistency. Even within a single song, the artist moves from mellow to racing. This is across songs. Vocals could be left out altogether, and what was there was not good work."
3,A nice change,This is a good CD for the holidays. It offers a different twist on the classics. It will make a nice addition to anyone's smooth jazz holiday collection.
4,nice jazz,This is good listening for those who love jazz. I was expecting total instrumental music but it still delivers.
4,The cake made my daughters 2nd birthday party,"I bought this to use on my daughters cake for her 2nd birthday. It was perfect, my mom put it on, but she said it was pretty easy. It looked great and shipped fast too!"
4,Addresses more than the physical well-being of your cat.,"Ms. Milani uses humor and numerous anecdotes to address the total health of companion cats. She does an excellent job of listing questions every owner or perspective owner should ask themselves regarding the responsibilities and expectations of that come from sharing one's life with a cat or cats. Cat lovers of any experience level should find this a helpful and informative book. My only criticism, if it can be taken as such, is her almost-exclusive focus on purebreed cats. I share my home with twenty mixed-breed cats and volunteer at the local animal shelter, and would have enjoyed this book much more had the author not limited her comments to cats of established breeds. Since the vast majority of companion cats are of mixed or uncertain parentage, I felt this was a major oversight that may leave those who got their cat from the parking lot at the grocery store feeling second-class."
2,It's cheap--what more can I say.,"You get what you pay for. That's still true. The station tuning button didn't work well. When I tune in for a station, the station number didn't show up correctly. The radio station that shows on the front window always screw up. I get some stations though. It would be good enough for those listening to a few stations (not radio surf) and stick with them. I bought it for the speaker feature. Not many small or tiny radios have the speaker function, most require a headphone. I give it a small credit for its overall small size and the decent sound that comes out of its tiny speaker."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I couldn't find a Sony Walkman so I tried one of these. The appearance of this piece of junk is deceiving. It has a digital display however tuning the tuning knob is very crude, sticky and analog.FM tuning bands are very broad and overlap allowing for considerable interference. AM sensitivity is very poor compared to my Sony Walkman headphone AM/FM radio and compared to the lost Sony Walkman pocket radio I hoped to replace. Ironically a wire antenna that plugs into the earphone socket is included but does ZERO for the AM band.There are separate power on and power off buttons; dumb. An additional annoyance the power on button defaults to the AM band.The most useless feature is the built in alarm clock. I can only imagine this piece of feature-itis was added to make up for the deficiency of this product in the area of its intended purpose."
4,"good puzzle, but the two sided-ness is confusing","I think the picture is terrific for kids, and the puzzle is very sturdy, but it wasn't clear to me when I ordered it that there were two sides. That discouraged my child from trying to assemble it. I wish it had been two different colors, at least."
3,"Sturdy Puzzle, but dumbed down","The quality of this puzzle seems great, however I must agree with some of the complaints of other reviewers. They should have used the proper bone names for this puzzle. Any child who is old enough to put this puzzle together is old enough to learn tibia instead of shin or patella instead of knee. I also thought it was odd that the esophagus bypassed the stomach and went straight into the intestines."
5,A humble band creates powerful music.,Listening to this album is such a joy! Anathallo mixes the sound of classical minimalist inspired bands like Sigur Ros with a genuine message to create unique and meaningful music. I particularly enjoy tracks five through seven--a beautiful sequence of songs to compliment any activity in my day! This album is a fantastic supplement for fans who find themselves in between Anathallo concerts.
5,One of my favorite cds of all time,"This may sound hard to believe, but after listening to the album you will understand why. Simply magnificent."
2,Archangel Pretty Dull!,"Nothing much happens in this futuristic cyber society. Cyber angels stalk the LINK (a futuristic version of the internet) while real angels inhabit human bodies and skulk around in pseudo-spy fashion. It captured my interest at first, but quickly went nowhere. I'm a bit disapointed because angels should make for a great subject in fiction but so far no one had been able to hit a high mark. The writing is good, the characters are interesting...I just wanted some plot. This had great potential but never reached the heights."
3,Needed more editing,"This book rates a five for concept, a one for integration. The writing is about average, so everything works out to a three. Morehouse has some very interesting ideas, but the book reads like a second or third draft, where various bits have been added to make the plot flow, or make better sense, but haven't been very well integrated yet. For instance, the disjunction between the heroine's continual doubts about what is going on and the author's rather heavy-handed foreshadowing/intimation becomes tiresome. Little riffs on human enhancement, apparently to make the angels appear more human and therefore support the heroine's doubts, read like afterthoughts. All in all, interesting, almost worth a read, and certainly worth a more careful edit. And just a note to the number one reviewer--it is a Medusa bomb, not a Plasma bomb."
5,Peace and Justice - a subculture struggles to survive against powerful opposition,"The is a book I return to again and again to better understand a struggle for freedom going on right at our doorstep - in a remote area of Mexico. It has been helpful to me in understanding the ancient ways of the descendants of native cultures on this continent and what is required to preserve a way of life that is daily threatened. I am constantly reminded of the wisdom of a friend and teacher who teaches peace and justice workshops: ""When you study history, ask what YOUR family was doing when such-and-such happened."" That approach is made more feasible by reading this book."
4,Good But Not Great,"This is an amazing record. For those old murphys fans it's gonna take a little while to get past the differences between good ol Mike McColgan's voice and the newest murphys member Al Barr's. If you're looking for the next Do or Die, don't look here. If you're looking for a good Boston punk c.d. you've come to the right place."
5,Allroy0234,"I believe this record ranks up there with Bad Religion's ""Suffer"", one of the greatest punk records ever made. The Gang's all Here is in general, a recording of UNITY. Something that is missing in the Punk scene. Songs about friendship, death and the wroking class...........It's all here"
5,RAW PUNK ROCK,"A lot of this sounds kind of like a faster version of Rancid. Thats not surprising since Lars Frederikson produced it. This is a great album despite the change in frontmen. The best tracks are ""Pipebomb on Landsdowne"", ""The Gangs all Here"" and ""Blood and Whiskey""... Hell, all of it!"
4,Today's Oi! - Heroes,"No doubt, Dropkicks are today's heroes! With their brandnew record the bois proof again that they're the best US-(OI)Band! Although ""The Gang's all here"" is not as good as ""Do or die"" (how could it??), it's still blowing yer head off!! But sadly their new singer isn't as good as the old one (how could he?) and the sound's a bit less-melodic and more hardcorish or what... Nevermind, ... still better than the most!!!"
5,This album is by far the best of them all.,"This album is just amazing! The tracks go back to more OI! punk and stick to the band's core belief system. They are Irish, working class, and union supporting houligans that have no problem letting you know that. They are not ashamed of who they are on this album at all, and are just right in your face. The songs ""Blood And Whiskey"" ""10 Years Of Service"" and ""Devil's Brigade"" have gone on to become classic Dropkick Murphys anthems.This album is full of wonderful songs including a killer ending of a punk rock instrumental version of ""Amazing Grace"" and a wonderful song about uniting with fellow DKM fans titled ""The Gang's All Here""You deserve this album! You MUST by this album! It's the real Dropkick Murphys experience!"
3,not the same,this cd is simply not the dropkick murphys. the new singer is ok but it seems that tdk has wandered away from their roots. im sure they still kick in concert!
3,Too phony,"Al's accent is so affected it cracks me up. The Irish touches on this record are pretty weak... ""Amazing Grace"" and ""The Fighting 69th"" are pretty damn forced. Plus, this record's HC is pretty bland with a few shining exceptions -- Pipebomb on Lansdowne and The Gang's All Here are good eg's."
3,Where are the anthems?,"""Do or Die"" may very well be my favorite punk album since ""London Calling"", but the follow-up is somewhat disappointing. It utterly lacks the anthemic quality so central to ""Do or Die"". Likewise, ""The Gang's..."" lacks the more traditional celtic arrangements that made the Dropkick Murphys such a memorable part of the Boston scene... I haven't given up on this album yet, but I must admit my initial reaction is, sadly, very mixed."
3,Nothing Special,"The DM are really just a straight ahead punk band with minimal Celtic window dressing. Punk fans will probably be pleased with them, but they are nothing special. I gave the CD away."
2,not as good as Do Or Die,"now..i'm not really putting this album down because of the new lineup ( only two of the original members )..and because of the big difference in Al's voice compared to Mike's ( I am a fan of the Bruisers too)..but because the songs really arent all that good . There are some good songs ""10 Years Of Service"" , ""The Fighting 69th"" and ""The Gangs All Here""...but everything else seems to be boring filler tracks that are nowhere nearly as catchy and memorable as anything on Do Or Die..or The Singles Collection. Alot of people complained about Barr's voice , but it's really a good oi! voice , it's just these songs are (...)Maybe Sing Loud , Sing Proud is better..I havent heard it..but I was really disappointed with this one"
1,DO OR DIE! DO OR DIE!,"Its obvious that the original line-up of the band on do or die is way better.The songs are better written,better sounding and the versatility and raw power of Mike Mccolgans voice is much better than Al Barr's cookie-monster-hardcore-voice.The record(gangs all here)is a disappointment.I miss the old line-up and so do a ton of people.Nice try but no way can this new line up match up with the older version.The Do or Die record will always stand as their finest moment.......Songs like baroom hero,caught in a jar and finnegans wake are priceless! I seen the original line-up with Mike play in northampton ,ma a couple years ago with the amazing royal crowns and they blew the roof off the place with the older songs.....I know I sound like sour grapes but its true that the old is way better than the new,,,,,,,,"
2,Bogart as a wife killer,Length:: 5:37 MinsIf you like this type of film you'll also enjoy...* The Letter 1940 - Bette Davis and Herbert Marshall* Notorious 1946 - Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains* Double Indemnity 1944 - Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray* Mildred Pierce 1945 - Joan Crawford and Zachary Scott* The Postman Always Rings Twice 1946 - Lana Turner and John Garfield* Shadow of a Doubt 1943 - Joseph Cotten is a serial wife killer* Sorry Wrong Number 1948 Barbara Stanwyck and Burt Lancaster* Dial M for Murder 1954 Ray Milland and Grace Kelly.
4,A good one from Palin and Jones. Funny and sweet.,This is a good episode of the Ripping Yards series. I like it better than Escape from Stalag episode which seemed to repeat the joke over and over. This does as well but the premise is better. a dim bulb who gets a taste of excitement. Very well portrayed by Palin. This is not Python or Fawlty Towers. There is a realness and a sweetness to these episodes. You will laugh but it's not a hysterical tone - it is a real dramatic feel with an underlying silliness. Good stuff. Feels like a lost treasure.
5,Buy this album,"I bought this album because a freind reccomended it to me. Normally I listen to pop punk and my friend listens to classic rock so I didn't expect much but what I got was the possibly the best album I have ever heard. I didn't know it was possible to make music this great. Every guitar solo on this album is absoluteley incredable. I can't bevieve this band isn't at the top of the charts I mean being on a major label and all. this band can't really fit in any genre of music but if you like any kind of music perticularly any kind of rock'n'roll I garontee you will love this album. This album reaches way back to rock'n'rolls roots and takes the very best qualities from every type of music, while still adding countless inovations of there own. This album takes the very best from every genre without the bad. if it is possible this album is perfect"
1,SCHLOCK,"I'm sorting through a bunch of old radio station CDs....to decide what goes in the Dozen for Five Bucks bin at the flea market. I was kind of excited to see Five Stars come up (before I threw this peice of schlock in the carriage). <YAWN>What do you other reveiwers LISTEN to???? I can't remember any of these songs WHILE THEY ARE PLAYING. If I see you at the flea market and you freak out when you find it and start to palpitate and everything, it's yours- GRATIS."
3,OK,"This book is pretty tame and concentrated on the Seattle Seahawks. No problem there except some of the personal vignettes at the end of the book are all about that team, too. I love football so the book was interesting but not in my top 15 list."
4,Great perfomances I never saw!,"This is good to see his performances. You more or less get the full idea of what Rick James was about. The only flaws are the quality of the TV show performances. While not bad, they are not pristine either. I comapre it to The Temptations ""Get Ready"" DVD where you had video from the mide 60's to the mid 70's and they all looked like they were filmed yesterday! The Rick james DVD was from the late 70's to the 80's and it was not the finest quality, but not bad either. The ONLY BAD video was the ""Ebony Eyes"" video. One of the reason I bought this is because everytime I find a verison on the net, it is an old ""Video Soul"" VHS low quality copy. Sadly, that is what we get here! The other official videos are DVD quality. Still worth a buy."
2,Rick James Lover,"This dvd is not the best. Although it allows you to see Rick from a very young musician until he hit the big time, I expected a little more insight on Rick -- maybe a little more upclose and personal. If you need a reason to buy this dvd, then buy it for the mere fact that the Temptations (""Standing On The Top"") perform with Rick -- which is the best segment of the dvd. The dvd is worth the purchase simply because of this performance; otherwise, pass it by."
5,RICK!,"If you are a fan of Rick's, this will bring back a ton of memories. Even though his lip sincing sucks!"
1,don't bother,"I got this book expecting a mindless beach read...what I got was bored to tears from a book that was entirely too mindless. The 80's nostalgia stuff was fun at first, but got old really quick."
2,Flat overall,"It had some charming moments, but overall I found this satire to be flat. The constant name-dropping is an easy and to me well-worn device to create a sense of time and place. But what's more is that I just never really cared about the characters. It both tries too hard and yet not hard enough."
5,Profusely enhanced with color photography throughout,"Throughout its 25 year history, Conrail was a freight line connecting most of the America's northeast's major cities and was especially noteworthy for clean locomotives, tight schedules, and heavy freight trains. The latest addition to the outstanding ""MBI Railroad Color History"" series, Conrail is the collaborative work of railroad enthusiasts Timothy Doherty and Brian Solomon. Profusely enhanced with color photography throughout, this well researched and deftly presented history is informed and informative reading, and an enthusiastically recommended addition to personal, academic, and community library Railroading History collection."
1,DissAppointed,The glasses were a fake copy no certificationAs promised case was oversized not originalCleaning cloth was an off cut quality of glasses veryPoorLuckily money was refunded after I submitted claimTo amazon however still waiting for postageTo be refunded they sound good people but trustMe I got sucked in with the good reviews and theFact they are supposedly based in ItalySTAY AWAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Another Must-Have for Serious Biblical Homemaking,I have purchased 3 of this book and given them all away - two for wedding showers and one for my daughter's hope chest. It is a wholesome and biblically-based treatise for the centrality of home in a woman's life and focus. J.R. Miller does an excellent job at extolling the virtues of homemaking in a way that draws young women's hearts - sometimes challenged by the outward call of the culture- to whole-hearted preparation of the sanctuary of home for their families. Older women can be rekindled in their passion for their families and serving them in the God-honored position as mother and wife.
5,"Encouraging, Inspiring Read","JR Miller never fails me. He writes so beautifully about so many important topics. I eagerly seek Biblical advice and teaching on a woman's role, and this is the place to find it. He does not ""beat around the bush"" but goes straight for the heart issues and seeks to help women in their home and with their husbands and children. True Biblical wisdom!"
3,Ive not heard it,This is one of those CD's that I've not yet heard.I was looking for it but the record shop was sold out. It's funny that ! You never can tell when that may happen.
3,"Good techno, mediocre as a ""tribute""","A few of the remixers do a decent job of understanding Reich's music and translating it to a technobeat, but none of them really ""get it"" I think. Nobody works with rhythms that gradually go in and out of phase with each other, nobody works with songs that very gradually evolve and change...If you like both Reich and techno, you'll probably enjoy trying to identify the sources of the sounds, and there are sometimes some surprising and pleasing results from juxtaposition of Reich recordings. If you like techno, it's a good techno cd, but you won't really learn anything about Reich. If you're expecting something where the remixers are reaching artistically, trying to elaborate upon and learn from Reich's compositions, I think you'll be disappointed."
5,Techno is pretty minimalist anyway.,"As a long time fan of both Steve Reich and the DJ scene, I've always been waiting for this CD. If you've never heard of Steve Reich before, listen to any Stereolab CD to get an idea of what's up. Also, when you listen to this CD, make sure that you have headphones on, the lights off (or a blacklight) and nothing in your mind. This will really take you places."
2,An Homage That Misses The Point,"Various DJs manipulate samples from Reich's works and forge them into overbearing, beat-driven loops; the very definition of the phrase, ""lost in the translation."" Bypass this and check out the originals."
2,"Decent, but disappointing overall.","There are a few really good tracks on this CD. My personal favorites are Music for 18 Musicians, Four Sections, the Megamix, and Piano Phase. The Desert Music remix (the bonus track) is okay, not great, but okay. And then there's the bottom end of the spectrum, which is everything else. Unfortunately, what I like is overpowered by what I dislike."
3,Enjoyable tribute misses the point,"For techno lovers, this is a moderately enjoyable album. The ""kids"" are growing up and paying attention and homage to the roots of their style.They do, however, have more to learn. The brilliance of Reich's works is not the melodies, but the temporal dissonance between melodies performed at slightly different speeds. The remixers have only sampled one side of the performance, neglecting the elegant dissonance created with the other 1-9 performers.It's a worthwhile album. I look forward to the next incarnation of it when the dissonance is properly treated."
5,I disagree,"I am surprised that the previous reviewer entertained the possibility of confusing Boolos with Boole. In my opinion, this book does credit to the reputation of George Boolos for being a fine logician. In addition, it addresses fundamental issues of computability building on a relatively rudimentary knowledge of first-order predicate logic."
2,Math majors avoid,"If you are a math major, you don't want this book. Get Cutland.This book was written by philosophy professors and shows it. When philosophers write math, it is less concise, organized, and complete than when mathematicians do it. This was meant as an intermediate logic text for philosophy and math students, but it would try the patience of a math major. The explanations are wordy, sketchy, and poorly related to each other and to exterior topics.The contents fall into thirds: Turing machines, aspects of decidability, and a hodge podge of topics from other parts of logic. The 4e is 50 pages (17%) longer than the 3e. The changes were mainly adding exercises and making the chapters more independent. The authors were obviously trying hard to make a readable text, but I hated slogging through all that verbiage. You can see a lot of comment in the other reviews that the 3e was better, but I think even the 3e is poor compared to Cutland."
1,"The horror, ...., the horror ...",My eyes began to bleed from the pain and agony that comes with having to read another chapter. Reading this book was worse than passing a bowling sized kidney stone. Definitely not recommended for those with a pulse and breath oxygen.
3,poor images quality,"Good book, like an encyclopedia about air dropped weapons.Very vey poor quality of pictures but very well text about the weapons.I'm sorry this book regard only american air lauched weapons."
3,"NOT Heavy Metal at all, but simply Hard Rock","Ok, let me first make it clear that I'm an ""80's product"", meaning I was there in both high school and college. I remember what was what as far as music goes. This band, CREATURE, was one I've never heard of. The listing for this CD was very encouraging saying it was a re-release of a ""1989 German heavy-metal classic"". Well, these guys aren't heavy-metal in any sense of the term.I'm not saying they stink (I will keep the CD), but it's not heavy-metal. They have keyboards (lots of 'em) and they are more along the lines of SUPERTRAMP, FOGHAT and REO-SPEEDWAGON, to name a few hard rock bands. I'm just trying to give the next buyer more of a clue as to what they're getting from CREATURE.Hope this helps..."
2,Good idea poor workmanship,"The iFM remote worked great for about 4-5 days then the cord that connects to the ipod broke just like another customer reported. The thing now only plays the radio and thats it. No remote functions or recording. The cord seems to be made of really chep plastic. Then another thing is the iFM is just plain ugly to have attached to my jacket, because it has these two cords coming out one end of the controller looking like a jungle has attacked my ipod. Basically I wouldn't buy it again. Nice concept poor materials."
2,Be careful about compatibility,"It's not clear from the description that this product only works with older model iPods with the remote control port. It didn't work with my Classic, and won't work with any recent model iPod. The seller refunded my money with no problem."
2,I love this thing but it keeps breaking!,"I use this every morning to switch between listening to talk shows and podcasts on my iPod, and for me it works great! Reception is almost always good for the FM stations, and I've had no problem with the controls (altho' the tiny buttons are kind of hard to manipulate with my work gloves on) HOWEVER, I had the same problem as other reviewers...the wire that comes out of the piece that connects to the iPod is soon loose and then breaks. I could not use the unit at all. I had it about 3 months when it first happened; I read somewhere else that Griffin will send you a new one. So I contacted them, and was told ""I must have a defective unit."" They had me send it back to them and promptly replaced it. Good customer service! But the second unit almost immediately did the same thing...I tried wrapping electrician's tape around the wire to keep it immobile but was not successful."
2,"my cord broke, too",I should have listened to the negative reviews here - had same problem with the cord coming loose within a matter of a week or two.
3,IFM Recorder functionality varies,"In my year of owning this product, I have had it serviced two times. After awhile the cord gets a short and the unit doesn't operate anymore. If I had to purchase this product again at this price, I'd pass and wait for better version from Griffin."
2,A bit dissapointed,"To be honest I was very excited before getting this, now the griffin ifm has been sitting in a pile of unused junk; here's why:I have an Ipod Mini, the IFM does not support direct radio recording on this model, as well there are no software updates available to fix this.So basically what I have is just an overly expensive fm radio, which has mediocre sound quality (the wire on the unit is used as the antennae) which really doesn't provide the best reception. So, even if I were able to record the radio, (which i'm not) I doubt I would be happy with the sound quality of the recordings. Purchase with care."
4,A more valid view of Madame de Pompardour,"Not much of a scholar of French history, but a huge fan of Nancy Mitford, I ordered this book as a tribute to the author. Once reading it, I found out much more about the French court of Louis XV and the intricate rules it observed than I ever thought I'd learn. And am very glad I learned them. The interesting, well-written biography hold the reader's attention and bring compassion to the often reviled lead character."
1,If Madame was this boring....,"If Madame De Pompadour was this boring, why did Louis put up with her? For a true rendering of his fabulous court, and where Madame becomes a more interesting person, please enjoy Ms. Mitford's ""The Sun King""."
3,a delightful romp in the Mitford tradition,"Anyone who has enjoyed Nancy Mitford's novels ""The Pursuit of Love"" and ""Love in a Cold Climate"" will appreciate what a deliciously witty writer she can be, especially when describing the lives of the privileged class. Reading her biography of Madame la Marquise de Pompadour (Mitford is strong on the use of proper aristocratic titles) one is not certain where Nancy's life ends and la Pompadour's life begins. Some of her comments are so ultra-sophisticated so as to be hilarious, such as calling the Parc aux Cerfs, where Louis XV kept his women, a ""nice little brothel."" This book may not be at the top of my list of serious scholarly tomes, but it is not without merit as a work of history, and one is given a colorful glimpse of another world."
4,"Yay, it's a bat!","Uh, it's a beanie baby for my six yr old. What else is there to say? He named it Marcus... Aww, how cute."
2,its ok for a novice gamer,"Its a nice pc dont get me wrong but if your into games you dont want a intergrated graphics card cause if you want a game that the one in the pc doesnt support you'd might have to buy a new mother board then upgrade everything else, Id just build my own."
5,The Entire Album is Awesome!!,"My favorite Songs are Simple Life, and The Story of Mary, but the entire album is great. I have listened to the whole CD from beginning all the way to the hidden Final Track, at least 10 times as I sit and write.This is great music to sit and listent to as you are trying to find a muse for poetry or writing. The songs put your mind in a receptive state, and I suggest this musice to anyone that enjoys the spoken word, Jazz, Blues and R & B.JonBoy"
4,The Fixx keeping their stride,"I got this record for two reasons: 1 The Fixx has been one of my favorite bands since hearing ""Stand or Fall"" and 2 Back when it was released, ""Driven Out"" was in my opinion one of the songs that made radio worth listening to. I like the way that Cy Curnin changes his voice within the songs. There is one song on this record that seems maybe a little out of place. That is ""Precious Stone"". Lyrically it fits well with the rest of the songs, but the music and singing are a little odd. If you are a fan of the Fixx but don't have this one yet, then I highly recommend getting it. It has plenty of their signature sound."
5,Dri-Lube,Recieved on time from Amazon and worked as advertized in the Speedloader. The only non-oil product from Remmingtonas recommended by the loader maker..
1,Item description misleading.,"The description says the item is a box with six four ounce aerosol cans per box. It also says the item was originally $39.50 but marked down to $6.18. Supposedly I was going to save $33 per box. I ordered two items thinking I was getting two boxes of six four ounce cans. I only received two four ounce cans. Please clean up this listing, Amazon! I am very disappointed in that I needed more than two cans for care packages going to Afghanistan."
2,Works on Limited Basis,"I bought this specifically to remove a pinion gear from the shaft of a broken DC motor. This type of gear puller design has been around for a long time, and I'd used a larger version with ease many years ago. The problem with this one is the jaws that are suppose to grab the rear of the gear being pulled slip off due to some manufacturing tolarance issues. Having a 3rd jaw, or some way to securely hold the gear would be a big improvement over the two opposing jaws that this model uses."
2,"look good, but uncomfortable, don't age well either","I've had them for a year now.They don't break in.They don't age gracefully.They are anything but comfortable.dr Scholls gels help, but not much.Heaviest pair of shoes, other than a futuristic pair of New Rock boots I have somewhere and will never ever wear, unless I am in a sci fi movie.People keep telling me how great my shoes look though, so I guess that's the pay off. Anything for the looks... arrrgh...I am a musician. Not quite a victim of fashion, but I put some effort in looking good sometime."
1,low quality,"the shoes feel cheap i will not buy anymore pairs,i bought two pairs trying to like them and quality is not there anymore. that was all i bought before.....doc's."
4,"Love Them, but runs large for women","These are nice shoes, but they run large. They flop around on my foot, and I'll have to get some inserts to take up some of the room in the toe-box. I wish I could send these back for the smaller size, but I already wore them.LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE! The UK sizes are hard to deal with since they don't have half-sizes. I finally figured out with my last few purchases (after 15 years of wearing them):If you are ordering a model MADE FOR WOMEN go to the next whole size bigger (i.e. US 7.5, should order a US 8)If you are ordering a UNISEX pair go DOWN a half size (i.e. US 7.5, get US 7)"
4,Great so far.,"I have Doc Martens that I still wear that were purchased in the 90's. I have read reviews of the newer ones that imply they are not made to the same standards. I hope that isn't the case, but so far, my new docs have held up well, look great and feel great."
1,Not comparable to UK-made Docs at all.,"I wanted replace my 3-year-old UK-made Docs. I had read a few bad reviews about the new Chinese-made Docs, but I decided to give them a try. As soon as I took them out the box, I noticed the difference. Cheap looking. Tried them on and they felt and looked no better than similar, knock-off styles of shoes that fall apart in a year or so. As for my 3-year-old UK-made Docs? They still have some mileage left in them and they're staying on my feet until I find something with more quality."
5,Why did I wait so long to buy these?,"I bought these shoes because I thought they looked cool and they do. They look amazing. This is my first and, so far, only pair of Docs. Therefore I was unaware of one amazing fact. They are truly the most comfortable shoes I have ever placed on my feet. I bought them without a single concern for comfort. If they hut my feet, big deal, they look great. Imagine my genuine suprise when I took a few steps in them and felt the air-cushioned soles and perfect fit. The price kept me from buying them previous to now. I'm certainly not the type of guy that wears a hundred dollar pair of shoes. They are made like they will last forever and they feel like walking on air. Now I know why everyone who owns Doc Martens swears by them. I should have bought these years ago."
3,Very nice looking shoe,"The style and looks are good....a little hard material,,, hard to break in.... I like a shoe you don't have to break in... They should be comfortable from the start... Have had dr martens before in brown and they were..."
5,The Pre-Med/Med Student's Bible,I was given this book as a gift when I made it public that I wanted to become a pediatrician. I'm graduating this year and entering Pre-med in the fall. This book is a MUST READ if you are thinking about going into the medical field. It cleared up many of the questions and uncertainties I have had. Everything is explained so clearly and completely. I especially like how it follows all the way to the MCAT and then Med school. I'll be able to use it all through my medical education.
3,Good only if your just starting your research,"I found this book pretty superficial. It includes a lot of common sense ancedotes that, if you've done much research at all, will sound very repetitive.It was a fast and boring read for me. If you want to read about being a physician Becoming a Doctor or Intern Blues are lot more meaty. And there's several better books about getting into medical school too."
1,"NO SUBSTANCE, NO FACTS, JUST FLUFF","I bought several medical career books and this one was by the worst. I have no clue how this book got such high ratings. It wasn't useful at all. Sure it's cheap but I wouldn't buy it if it was $1. That's how bad it is.DETAILS: It has no substance or factual information, it is not researched at all, it replies on author opinion without any facts, feels like the author is just trying to ""fill pages,"" and just repeats common sense stuff over and over again like be sure to research your career choice or know yourself.In other words, it doesn't tell you anything new or anything about medicine and IT DOESN'T GIVE ANY FACTUAL INFORMATION, just common sense stuff and fluff to fill pages.I bought several books and I highly recommend the Princeton's Reviews ""Planning a Life in Medicine."" Just buy that one. That's all you need. Skip this book!"
4,Not many books like this.,"Although this book is a little outdated, it answers many of the questions premed students have about getting into med school. It helped me to focus my efforts and keep on the path of becoming a doctor."
5,Did Rhino go off the Deep end?,"I tend to agree with the other reviewers with one exception. Where are the track timings? Are we supposed to guess? This is a glaring omission and unforgivable from a label like Rhino who has done fine things with Los Lobos, Little Feat, The Ramones, etc. If you read the booklet, they had two opportunities to give the timings and totally missed. My grade of five stars is really four and a half."
4,A very good box set,Many of today's metal bands should take a lesson from Deep Purple they have melody to there songs like the bands of today that just yell a lot. The first 3 cd's are classic Purple the 4th one is a little inconsistent but has some fine tunes also. I think you'll be surprised by some of the sounds on this disc. Really 4 and 1/2 stars.
4,A better than average boxed set.,"This set will probably be more useful to the new converts-the old legions of fans will probably complain about the exclusion of certain favorite concert staples.Personally,I believe that this set could have used a fifth disc,including more songs from the Turner and Morse eras."
3,So Close...,"I have been looking for a decent Purple collection for what seems like forever. NOBODY gets it right! Each has ridiculously glaring omissions, and how could you even think about excluding Blackmore's tour de force, the classic ""Hard Lovin' Man"" from any of these collections? After umpteen tries, I say it's time to try again."
4,A Must for the collector,"For the serious Deep Purple collector, this one is It. Containing 62 tracks of Deep Purple's favorite's, from the early years up to the latest songs. A mix of live, with studio, and the full length UK version of Speed king. 4 disc's of Deep Purples finest archive's."
5,Well.,"If you buy one Deep Purple ""Best Of,"" buy THIS ONE. It doesn't just contain all the favourites and famous songs, it has a number of rare and releases, and a very full history in the (huge!) booklet as well. Buy it. You won't regret it! ;-)"
4,Great little book!,"I really loved reading this autobiography by Fred Basolo. It covered a wide range of chemical histories, and would be very useful for researchers or teachers interested in the history of inorganic chemistry, especially with regards to Northwestern University in Chicago. It would also be a good book for college or graduate students who are interested in the history of inorganic chemistry."
2,Can't get over the taste,I bought this jelly for infertility reasons and I can't really say if it works or not because I can't get over how gross it is. You can't put it in anything hot so I can't mix it with my hot tea or anything. If you can get over the taste of things then more power to you. I personally am stuck with a whole jar of this stuff and wasted twenty something dollars.
2,Yuck!,"I was excited to start this stuff before my IVF cycle. I waited and waited for it to come in the mail. I finally got it, opened it up and my niece wanted to play with the bubble wrap it was wrapped in. When I opened the wrap up a bunch of glass fell out, my bottle was cracked everywhere and I already opened it up before noticing so I can't send it back. They need to figure a better way to ship.IT'S NASTY! there is no way I can gag this stuff down. In no way or form does it taste like honey or jelly. It taste like a bad vitamin with a mushy texture and smells even worse.As for the benefits I couldn't review on that because I couldn't gag it down."
5,Sweet as honey,"This product is as sweet as honey! No problems I rather enjoy taking it! I can't say if it ""works"" but I haven't had any side effects or trouble taking it! It is thicker than honey but just as sweet!"
1,"Maybe OK for a state overview, but consider alternatives...","After fully exploring Colorado's tourist and scenic opportunities over the past 20 years, I wanted to learn more about Utah. This disk did not offer much information. The coverage of the state is so generic that no trip planning could really come as a result of watching it. A person would be dollars ahead by just using ""UTAH TRAVEL"" as a seach string on any internet search engine. Avoid this one."
3,This shows good effort,"The Spanish American War was really the first event to totally unify the country after 33 years of grudges and animosities caused by the War Between the States. This, in reality, is also what really ushered the United States into the 20th century. This DVD is a good effort in getting authors together who definitely know something about the war and gives the viewer much insight into information the average American citizen, military or civilian, would not have been in a position to know at the time. As a military buff, I was not impressed with the way the cavalry was portrayed. While I refuse to take away the exploits of the Rough Riders and the 2 black cavalry regiments (9th and 10th Cavalry), I was taken by the total absence of the 1st, 3rd, and 6th regular U.S. Cavalry regiments, who definitely carried their share of the load. Other than that, this is a DVD well worth having and I recommend it to anyone, along with ""Crucible of Empire"" and ""Birth of a Superpower""."
4,"The Spanish American War, First Intervention",Excellent combination of historical facts and historic reenactments. Shows how proper use of the press can over ride common sense and good judgment in dealing with situations. well made and great use of historically accurate reenactor groups.
5,Very good and intense.,"I like Jack Wagner as a singer. I wanted to see what he was like as an actor. It was good, I liked it."
4,Captivating,"The story of Madam C.J. Walker,the hair care product pioneer and America's first black female millionaire is the rags-to-riches story that this country was built upon. Based on reaserch done by Alex Haley prior to his death, Tananarive Due weaves a spellbinding tale of determination, heartbreak, and triumph. Spanning the time following the Civil war to the early 1900's, she is able not only to tell the story of Sarah Breedlove, later to be renamed Madam C.J. Walker, but intertwine that compelling story with historical events. The book is character driven, and those characters come to life in these pages. This was a delightful book, and thouroughly involving."
3,We lost Sarah when she became Mme Walker.,"I DO understand that a fictionnalized biography as nothing to do with a complete biography. And that kind of book can be very enjoyable. But this book read AS a biography, and not a very good one. It is a rather long list of Mme Walker's actions and we lose her character, the one we liked in the first half of the book, somewhere when she gets rich. What I mean is that we lose the connection on Sarah Breedlove on the way. This can happen when reading a biography, when fact follows fact after fact, but it should never happen in a novel becaus we lose interest.It reads like a Danielle Steel novel. The one about the Titanic, remember? No Greater Love.I wonder what jewel Alex Hailey would have done with this!Maybe I should read A'Lelia Perry Bundles, Mme Walker's great-great granddaugther, biography... Or go back to The Body Project by Kathy Peiss..."
4,Wonderful read,"Madame C.J.Walker's climb from abject poverty to successful entrepreneur at any time in history would be judged extraordinary.This book is a great blend of fact and fiction to give the reader a better feel for what it must of been like for this phenomenal woman to acheive this level of success. The use of fiction to ""fill in the gaps"" of what we know of her motivation and personal life may offend the purist in search of a historical picture of this great woman. Those books are available and are great sources for the facts. Ms. Due's book just gives us a different view that I found simply delightful."
4,A wonderful collection of Fairytales,"This is a collection of cute little renderings of classic fairytales. Like all collections of fairytales, these stories all have morals, the only problem is, some of them are immoral, ie: Cleverness is better than honesty or kindness. But by and large, a nice production that teaches good morals.Another excellent feature is the original Japanese dialog. So if you're looking for clean entertainment to get your kids started on Japanese, go for it!Oh yes, one more thing, HELLO KITTY IS TOTALLY AWSUM!!! ^_^"
1,One and done,"My PNY card worked fine for a one year and suddenly went belly-up. One day it was simply unreadable. There's a ""lifetime"" warranty, but do I really want another of these?"
1,Drains batteries in Fuji S7000,"You should not buy this compact flash card if you have a FujiFilm S7000 camera as it will drain the batteries.I bought the memory yesterday and put it in my S7000. It's been less than 24 hours, and I have had to replace the batteries twice (I've taken about 10 pictures total with the camera turned off most of the time).Other than that the memory seems to work fine in the camera.Note, I cannot comment on other cameras as this is the only one I've tried the card in. I believe this is a known problem in the FujiFilm S7000 camera, that some compact flash cards cause battery drains -- this is one of those cards. If you're looking for a 512MB CF card, consider instead the Lexar 40X 512MB WA card (CF512-40-380) as this works fine in the camera. I've also found that a SimpleTech 512MB works fine."
4,"Good performance, less than ideal fit","I actually use this more for voice recognition and office dictation via wireless set up then for my phone which is not Bluetooth enabled.The instruction booklet was very informative, however the unit, which I chose because of battery life, does somewhat pull at the ear.The plastic piece that connects the unit to your ear after one week of use has already snapped, and despite crazy glue unfortunately snapped again. The voice recognition part and transmission is excellent and the battery life is as advertised at eight hours after an overnight charge. While sitting in the ear, the buttons are fairly accessible without playing around. I used the Jabra product and the voice clarity on playback was not as good. Now the way this unit looks, you can pretend that you're a Starfleet indications officer, if anyone watched the old series. Overall I think it's performing as expected, and if it just was better able to hang in the ear, I'd call it an excellent unit."
4,Excellent noise cancelling,"This is the 3rd bluetooth headset I am trying (Jabra & Motorola) being the other two. Even though this is a bit bulky, I feel comfortable wearing it around my right ear. The noise cancelling is the best part of this headset. While driving on both highways & city roads, I have not had anyone complain about the background noise. I do have to attend a bunch of conference calls while I drive and this has been the best headset so far in term of clarity and noise cancelling quality. I have it paired to my Blackberry 7100t phone."
1,Broken ear clips,I have had this product for just under a month and now the second earclip is cracked and about to break. The little ring that connects to the main unit is thin plastic and snaps easily under light to moderate use. Now I guess I have to find more of them somewhere or stop using the device.
4,Great Ear piece... works great,works pretty good for the price... way cheaper alternative for the price then the $100 one every where else
2,It doesn't work with a PC,"If you want to use this device with your PC, buy another device. It doesn't work. I have called Plantronics support service and they say that it doesn't work.It works fine with my mobile phone. But is useless for PC.The problem is that Plantronics says that it works with PCs... What a shame. I feel I have been cheated"
5,A top pick for those who don't want to quickly resort to drugs,"Drugs are not always the answer. ""Stop ADD Naturally"" is an alternative medicine guide with advice on how to control ADD through natural diets and foods. Preaching the value of amino acids to one's health and nutrients that encourage funds and other ideas for helping a child excel in school, ""Stop ADD Naturally"" is a top pick for those who don't want to quickly resort to drugs."
3,FOR SMALL PANS,"GREAT IDEA, BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE SMALL FRYING PANS...ITEMS DON NOT STAY IN HOLDER AS PICTURED ABOVE.IF ITS SUPPOSED TO WORK SOME OTHER WAY, PLEASE SHOW ME!"
3,"Unable to use for one thing, but helped with another","when the product came it really was'nt what I thought it was. Unable to get my fry pans to work,in it and the space I needed it for had to come up with something else. So therefore I turned the pan rack on it's side, and I now use it for extra lids. Works pretty good."
4,Great for Storage of Pans,"I purchased two of these pan stackers, one for mom and one for me. I LOVE IT! It works great with my pans, keeps them from being bumped from the inside while ""nest"" stacking. Great space saver also. Fits in my standard sized lower cabinets and also the island. I would recommend this product for everyone who has more than one frying pan!"
1,These are terrible knives,They are very cheaply made and do not hold up well. After minimal use the handles are loose and the serrated blades were awful to start with.
5,dvd,Sent it as a gift and he thoroughly enjoyed it! Very big modern marvels fan and i think hell watch it over and over
2,Blackbook in Black & White,"The Offical Blackbbok Price Guide to United States Postage Stamps is official - in title only. Referencing the Scott Catalogues or checking with a stamp apprasier is the best way to get an idea of the value of a postage stamp. (Many of the Scott Catalogues are available in paperback and on CD-ROM.) Also the Blackbook has a limited number of colored pages - the front and back cover only. All other pages are in black & white. If you can afford it - go with the Scott Catalogues. For a wonderful, relatively inexpensive color guide to United States Postage Stamps, I highly recommend The Postal Service Guide to U.S. Stamps or the Scott U.S. Pocket Stamp Catalogue. Forget the Blackbook - it's over marketed."
3,"Beautiful Writing, Awkward Transitions","Though the book dealt with interesting material and exotic themes, I felt in some ways that the flow of the book was a bit awkward at times. There is more of the impression of having different episodes that together make up the story, with little transition between them. For example, the daughter's coming of age and relationship with her mother and grandmother could have been developed and explored much more to my satisfaction.Field's writing style however is delicious and thouroughly enjoyed it. I am interested in readng her other work."
1,"If I could give it zero stars, I would","Part of me thinks it's unfair to review a book I couldn't finish, but not when I really want to warn other people off! I've tried twice to read it, but both times couldn't get past about page 30.The writing is flat, the characters cardboard, and there's way too much purple prose. Diana's ""ginger-colored curls"" are mentioned three times in the first chapter; I GET it already! Also, I think it's kind of gratuitous to have sexual abuse of a character before that character's been brought alive to the reader; it's as if the author's trying to use sensationalism in place of character, plotting and a lot else. Do not buy this book."
3,Pretty good cd,"This was a good cd but the first West Coast Bad Boyz compilation was a lot better. But the best songs on this cd are RIP Tupac, Bangin', Got Tha Best Hand, Ups & Downs, Bad Boyz On A Mission, Roll Yo Voges, Hands On My 45, Breakin' Skrill, and Steady Mobbin'. Check this out, it's worth buying!"
1,I remember having this..,"I remember having this cd by Master P when he wasn't talented and before he sold out. I used to like his music, but he was a biter. West Coast Badboyz II Cd-MasterP"
3,Great news but...no Blu Ray?,"I re-watched this recently on cable in HD and it looked terrific, so, where is the Blu-Ray version?"
2,Get Rid of the Child Actors.,"Viewed: 7/12Rate: 37/12: John Goodman was a funny guy, but his talents were wasted in Matinee. If it wasn't for the annoying (they all were) children, Matinee might have somewhat worked. If I want to see a film about the Cuban Missile Crisis, I'll watch Thirteen Days. If I want to see a film about a movie experience within a movie, I'll watch Last Action Hero. If I want to see a film about teenage romance, I'll watch Mischief. And believe none of them contained annoying child actors and actresses. They really killed the film for me. The best parts of the film were the extra theater special effects. Then again, I actually thought of this movie after the Batman Movie Shooting. Go figure. All in all, Matinee is a waste of time. Even Cathy Moriarty looked tremendously bored."
3,none,i think this movie is exealent even if it is less realistic than what really happen in the early 60's i think.
5,This is a WUNDERFUL movie,"i really, really, really love this movie! it's sweet and fun and really cool. it's one of my favorites ever because it deals with really cool, corny cheaply made horror films which are really hilarious. john goodman makes a charming, whimsical, and endearing performance as a visionary film maker and the younger stars of the film are really amazing too. what can i say, this is the best and if you don't buy this, rent it!"
1,"Where are the extras, Universal?!","This is a fabulous movie, one that also appeals to film buffs. So you'd think the people who run Universal would have recognized that and used the opportunity to release this on DVD with the terrific cinematic extras that were part of the old laserdisc release -- namely the hilarious, full-length trailer, or movie-within-a-movie, ""Mant!"" (Look for ""Mant!"" on YouTube.)But, no, this 2009 edition of the DVD is nothing more than a repackaging of the old DVD that was devoid of extras.I would have bought this release in a heartbeat if it had the extras. Director Joe Dante wanted them included, but the clueless ones at Universal couldn't be bothered. So I'll spend my money elsewhere."
3,Goodman Plays A William Castle Type,"I used to have this movie on Laserdisc and I liked the quirkiness of it, as it deals with one of my favorite genre's of film, Schlocky movies. Goodman is wonderful in this and it was made with love for this genre."
3,"P..U R okay, butt No Limit iz kind ov shi*y","""Ghetto D"" iz cool,I like Mr. Serv-On and Mystikal. Tha best song haz got 2 be ""Pass Da Green"" and ""We Ryders"". ""Make 'em Say UGHH"" iz cool, Mix-X iz Tight, Butt it's Sylkk that can't rap. Tha boys voice iz wacked!! And so iz half ov your whole crew."
5,This is a must have !!!!!!,"Stop hating on Master P. I know he is far from being the best rapper but he knows how to put together a tight album. Songs like #2Let's Gettin 'Em, #7Plan B, #9Captin Kirk, #10Stop Hatin, #12Makem Say Ughh,and #14 Only Time Will Tell easily makes this album a classic."
5,EDITED SUCKS,THIS CD IS SIMPLY THE BEST RAP CD THERE IS. MASTER P EXPLODES WITH ALL THE SONGS. IF YOUR GET THE EDITED MASTER P GHETTO D CD YOU WILL HATE IT BECAUSE EVERY OTHER WORD WILL BE A BEEP OR A BUZZ. IT 'S A GREAT UN EDITED.
5,This CD is the bomb. I would recomend it to anyone.,"If you don't like this CD, i would eat it myself. You are guarenteed to like it."
1,Master P's CD is a joke,This CD I don't think is that good. I'm not a big fan of Master P's. I think his song have terrible lyrics and he think he's a tough soldier or something?. I don't recommend it.
1,to many uhhh's!,"if i could only put a half of a star i would all you b_i_itchs. whats all this crap with you guys filling up the whole underground category with mastr p's overated excuse to be a rap artist. i think he sucks, no matter if he were from the east coast or the west coast. get some real artists in the underground section like maybe Guru or the Roots. im out , peace to all the original artists for the nine double."
1,to many uhhs !,"why do you guys have so much crap about master p in the top 50 underground rap albums? i hate to tell you guys at amazon.com, but master p is not an artist from the underground. my opinion is he's one of the most overated rap artists out today. so how you could list almost everything he's ever done in the underground catogory is beyond me. why not try to get some real artists in there like Guru for example, or the Roots, but master p i don't know about you guys over there......peace to all the real and original artists for the nine double."
4,This CD is Da Bomb,I think that this Cd is some Good S*** A great CD By No Limit. Master P is Da Bomb and dis Cd is tight. No Limit Forever. Make Em Say UGH!!!!!
3,its okay,"the cd is okay, although there are really only 2 or 3 tracks that are really good & master p is redundant with the uhhhhh... gets annoying fast"
3,Overrated,"As in my other reviews of MP CD's, I think that this CD is overrated. I am a P fan, but he only raps good on other people's albums. He's not very good by himself. As a CEO, marketing genius, and producer he is great, but he is mediocre as a rapper, at least on this CD (Da Last Don was a great work of art, however). I miss my Homies* , despite public opinion, but Captain Kirk was one of the best songs ever. Mystikal's verse is just unstoppable. Stop Hatin', Make 'Em Say Ugh, and Song #2 (I forgot the name) are all great songs and are worth a listen, but the rest of the songs are mediocre to wack."
2,Not One Of P's Finest (Does He Have Any?),"Ghetto D was really the album that made Master P a short term MTV superstar and assured him his 15 minutes of fame. With surefire hits like ""I Miss My Homies"" & ""Make Em Say Ugh"", P got dealt a hell of a good hand and went on to make millions off of music, movies and clothing. The best song on the album, this many years later, is obviously ""Burbons & Laces"", which can still bang in your trunk or on your system at home on any given day. If you're looking for P's best work, you'd be better suited purchasing MP DA LAST DON or THE ICE CREAM MAN."
3,The end is near...,"I have to give Master P credit for what he has done with No limit, turning it from underground to cash cow. But along the way to riches and radio play, Master P went from cool to annoying. This album is alright, but from here on out everything P does is to stack his bank. That's cool for him, but disapointing to his underground fans."
5,This CD is Orange Mound Bound!,"Ghetto D is by far the most ""Hardcore"" hip-hop album ever! You need to use 24 hour arrival for this crunk album! I'm telling you Ghetto D made Master P who he is today, a legend. My personal favorites on this album are: Ghetto D, We Riders, Weed & Money, Make 'Em say UGH, and Burbons and Lacs. If you're into Rap, this is the god of it all!"
5,Easily one of the best.,"This is one of the best album's ever! If you don't like it then you might as well get out of the country! Some of the really good songs are, well..., all of them. Throw em' up, I miss my homies, Stop hatin', Plan B, Make em' say ugghh, let's get em', I could keep going. Each one is good. This is definately a CD that is worth buying, don't even think about it, just buy it now! It is worth every penny."
2,I only rated it low because of the actual product,"I remember this when it came out back in the day. ""Burbons and Lacs"" is the perfect song for rollin' home late at night, and ""Only Time Will Tell"" is as thoughtful as it ever could be. But, sadly, my original CD got stolen, and I never found a replacement. So, I was incredibly eager when it was rereleased. I snapped that one up...this cd was as close to a soundtrack to my suburban white thug coming up as any cd could be. But, the rerelease cd was sadly inferior. I actually didn't play right in any cd player I tried it in, and skipped about every other track. I could see no flaws on the disk, but it still did it after I had it cleaned professionally. That's how much I love this cd...but it still was all messed up. Maybe I'm a rare case, but still, come on New No Limit. First, the 504 Boys, then this?"
5,"Bout it,Bout it","This CD right here is very tight.It is the 3rd best P CD;1]ice cream man,2]ghettos tryin 2 kill me,3]ghetto d,4]da last don,5]ghetto postage,6]99 ways to die,7]only god can judge me.Best joints are ghetto d,lets get em,i miss my homies,throw em up,we riders,tryin 2 do something,make em say uhh,captain kirk,and only time will tell."
1,I Hated this CD,This CD was owful. WHen I bought it I thought it was going to be grind metal. When I opened it and listened to it I was ashamed and my mother spanked me because it has strong lyrics in it. I also blew my ear drums out.
1,NO LIMIT IS WACK,"Aiyo if you dont have this album or any other no limit albums, i strongly suggest you dont get any. Their lyrical flow has no style to it. They shouldnt be as rich as they claim to be."
1,Horrible!,"Master P is a horrible rapper, and doesn't write lyrics worth a dime! How can you listen to this?"
2,phlyphish4@aol.com,"Alright... Isn't it getting old already? I mean drugs, sex, and guns, there's got to be something else. It would be alright if he knew how to rap, but I'm sorry to all you No Limit fans out there... HE SUCKS!!!!! If you want good rap pick up OUTKAST'S ""AQUIMENI"" it is guaranteed not to let you down like Master P!!!!"
4,Master P...P for what?,"People give him 5 stars, some give him 1...I should say this album is the only Master P album that I fell was good because ""Da last Don"" dissapointed me a bit, so even if I'm not a No Limit fan (look at their covers!)I advise this album for those who might wanna see how does he rhyme...peace"
1,Stealin' mo' fo',"Stole the music to the O'Jays' song ""Brady"" and used it as the ""homies"" cut with his own lyrics. Should be called Master Plagarize"
1,Creepy,"Don't choose this title for an introduction to Spenser. Choose one later in the series preferable after Hawk's appearance in Promised Land. I have read and enjoyed most of Parker's later Spenser novels. This one is not as good.In this novel, Parker has yet to figure out how to make Spenser tough and believable. For example Parker has Spenser sleeping with a mom then her daughter. It is kinda creepy in that both seem obligatory. It is almost as if he couldn't decide what age he wants Spenser to be."
2,Promise but no punch.,"This is the first of Robert Parker's books that I've read, and were it not for the general raves by Parker fans and the continued popularity of the Spenser character I might not be willing to read further into the series. Stylistically, I'd say the work is embryonic (at least I hope so), and the plot & characterization simply have nothing new to add to the detective fiction genre. I'm told that Spenser is quite the wit but that must develop in future books because although he occasionally has the witty quip here, there was nothing that really made me sit up and take notice. But I did pick up a copy of 'God Save the Child,' and I'm hoping for something more substantial as I read further."
4,Good enough to keep me reading the series...,"I just recently returned to reading mysteries, and after reacquainting myself with Hammett & Chandler, and being introduced to Michael Connelly, I naturally decided on checking out the Spenser books. Like a couple of others here, I decided to start with the beginning.First, I quite enjoyed the character, although he, in this first novel, is a bit extreme & non-discriminate in his skirt chasing. I understand that mellows out later in the series.His show of intelligence and of advanced education fascinated me. This combined with the typical wise-cracking tough guy PI attitude makes Spenser (Note, everyone, his name is spelled with two S's) unique enough to continue following.The mystery itself was less than challenging, but the main character and the taut writing kept me going.Definitely a worthwhile read."
2,A Virtuoso's Baby Steps,"I remember once at the Museum of Modern Art seeing an Edward Hopper exhibit with his early sketches. There were glimpses of greatness amid a lot of pedestrian stuff. Ditto this book. Spenser's sharp dialogue is there, but not honed as it is in later books. But the plot is pedestrian, college and the rebellion scene, and there's no Hawk and no Susan to help broaden the interest and spice up the dialogue. Parker makes a quantum leap in God Save the Child, putting it almost all together at his current level in Book 2. I had read many Spencers before I located this beginning novel. Like the Hopper sketches, its greatest interest is in the glimpses of the genius to come. But if this had been my first Spencer read, I might never have gone on to the pleasure of the rest of them."
5,My fall buddies - Parker & Spenser,"I first picked up a Spenser novel in 1988. Since then, I've read all the Spenser novels every year as my own annual ""rite of passage"".I agree with others - Spenser wasn't exactly my idea of a man's man in this book. But don't give up ... his randiness dissipates, and he develops into a loyal, devoted, caring, sensitive thug.Start here, and don't stop. You'll wish you knew someone like Spenser before too long ..."
5,Excellent Introduction,This first Spenser novel does an excellent job introducing our hero. Most introductory stories drag - but this one moved at a fast-pace with lots of thrills and plot twists. I highly recommend this to any fan of the PI / Mystery genre.
5,Like the Spenser character,My first Spenser book. I have read the Jessie Stone novels and enjoyed them so I thought I would give Spenser a try. I will definitely be reading more.
3,The Godwulf Manuscript-Spencer #1,"This was a pretty good read, I wanted to read all of the Spencer series so here I am at the beginning. I can see how this character and the author will get better as the series moves along over a period of about 36 years."
4,Get Acquainted With Spenser,"I recently decided to become reacquainted with Spenser by reading the Parker novels. What better place than at the beginning? Right out of the gate, the novel offers entertainment and laughs. One of the more interesting twists is Parker's descriptions of what various characters are wearing. Did we really dress this badly in the 70s? A quick, fun read. Enjoy it!"
4,The Godfather of Sass,"Ah, Spenser. Edmund Spenser wrote ""The Faerie Queen."" And this Spenser is anything but. Former boxer, Korean vet, and armed to the teeth with moxie and sass. And a little hiphugger pistol for those moments when a Dennis-Miller-esque zinger goes right over the thug's head. This intro to Spenser is hilarious in its descriptions of early 70's apparel and attitudes, not the least of which is Spenser's bedding of a mother and daughter within a 24-hour period. Paging James Bond. Anyway, it's all for fun. The plot's kind of 1-2-3 but it's nice to see where Elvis Cole and Fletch (at least the movie Fletch) came from."
2,Missed Susan & Hawk,Rating is not on the always enjoyable writing of Parker (he's 10 stars) - but really missed Hawk and Susan- book seemed empty without them.
4,1st Spenser Book,Spenser's tough as usual - no Hawk yet- no Susan yet - but a good start to a great series.
5,The Godwulf Manuscript,Great book. I've read most of the Spenser books and loved them. I couldn't ever find this one until now. I enjoy Robert Parker 's writing style. Great dialogue and easy to read. I would recommend this book to the mystery lovers everywhere.
4,Good Basic Computer,This is a good basic computer. The price is right for 120GB and 512RAM. This is a big step up from my Windows Me Emachines. I love it up to this point.
5,"A story for everbody, no matter what your age is.","This book has it all. It shows the bond that man has with animals. It has humor, sadness and the poetry is touching. This is a book that I will read more than once. Some books I read and give away, but this will stay with me. I always keep my favorites."
3,Did not come but money refunded really quick,"The product did not come. However I was promptly refunded my money. This is an old product so there was a chance of this happening. In a world where you have to nearly swear out some companies for not delivering, this company came through like a champ. That's doing right by your customer and that's always good. I would buy from them again."
3,Could be better,"Overall this is a good ablum, but it could've been better. The music is just the typical teenage rock style music with all the usual teenage issues. Nothing really deep and meaningful or with any serious political overtones.The only annoying bit about album is one voice. There's an out-of-place/out-of-key/out-of-tune squeeling voice in tracks #1 and #8 which spoils the music. It makes those songs almost sound like a cheap garage production with some wannabe who can't be trying to sing.All I can is get rid of that voice or at least ask her to stop singing or at least get some lessons, and this band will go much further. I would've rated this album 4-stars if not for that annoying voice!"
3,"Good pop album, catchy","It would have been 3 1/2 stars, but ... does not offer that...First, let's get this straight: LILLIX is NOT rock; they are pure pop. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that they've put out a decent debut album. Perfect for bright, sunny days and roadtrips, most of the songs on Falling Uphill are catchy and better than what's currently on the radio. The girls in LILLIX are definitely talented.BEST SONGS: Tomorrow, Invisible, QuicksandWORST SONG: 24/7 It's the only one I consistently skip. It really irks me, annoys me, and drives me up the wall.Overall, Falling Uphill is worth your money. It's decent pop music."
5,Lillix is amazing!,"They could be compared to the Donna's, or even Avril Lavigne. But I personally think that Lillix has their own style, ranging from punk rock to soft pop. Every one of their songs are catchy and upbeat, and there is not one song that I really dislike. Their songs are always in my head! They are definitely original and fun. Ever since I heard their single on TRL, ""Its About Time"" I knew that this was definitely a CD that I had to get.Their song ""Promises"" is my absolute favorite song on the whole album. Some other great songs are ""Dirty Sunshine,"" ""Quicksand,""Sick,"" ""Tomorrow,"" and ""24/7""I would recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys good rock/pop music. Buy this CD! Its definitely worth every penny."
5,One of the best girl bands,"When I heard the song, ""It's about time"", I just had to find out who the group was. It is an great song full of girl power. They have such a clean sound that just catches your attention. I literally listen to the cd all day at work. It just energizes me up. This is the year of the girl bands and Lillix is in the lead. I dare you listeners out there, listen to the cd and fall in love with it. Lillix has style, rhythm and most of all the voices and talent."
5,Lillix Rocks,One of the best new cds to come out. Awesome songs and music. A must have for a real music fan.
5,GREAT CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Lillix is an absalutely GREAT band! I mean it. I listned to it at my friend's house- and I fell in love with it. If you buy it, then I promise you will like at least 4songs on the CD!!!!"
5,Lillix - Falling Uphill,"I bet you've already heard Lillix's hit single ""It's About Time."" It's been playing on radio stations for months! This new band has catchy tunes and an awesome CD. With other songs including ""What I Like About You,"" ""Tomorrow,"" and many more, this CD is guaranteed to get to number one on the billboard charts. So go to the store and buy this great CD. It's definitely worth the money, especially if you like the kind of music that you can sit in your car with the top down and sing all of the words to. It's guaranteed to put you in a great mood!"
4,if avril had 4 sisters.....,"Obviously the first person that Lillix will be compared to is Avril Lavigne. The music is rather similair but in my personal opinion Lillix are no Avril. The stand-out tracks are 'tomorrow, its about time, dirty sunshine and what I like about you. To some people this may be too poppy for their tastes but I would consider this to be more pop/rock (there go the avril comparisons again). It is an album of 12 very good songs each with their own respective, catchy chorus. For a debut effort this is probably as good as you will find in this genre of music. Dont let the girls ages fool you - they are very talented musicians who on this showing will be around for some time yet !"
4,Great CD!,"This is a GREAT cd. You can relate too a lot of songs on it, and its something all ages can listen too. I really suggest you get this cd."
1,omg,"Oh my god what HARDCORE rock! These girls are mind blowing, they rock harder than Black Sabbath and Guns N Roses ever did! They are amazing on stage and put on one hell of a show!Yeah, and I'm married to Daniel Johns...THIS CD IS PURE CRAP. GARBAGE."
2,Lyrical morons,"This CD has possibly the worst lyrics in the history of man, very simple rhyming poetry where each line barely connects to the last (ie, and i wake up/put on my make up/pick up the phone/nobodys home/i need to break out/give me some take out/standing side the crowd/i wanna scream out loud). The parts where they are not screaming reveal that there is very little vocal talent to be had within this group. However, the songs were catchy and I don't think this is a BAD CD, just a very sophomoric debut. I personally think I could write lyrics and sing better than these girls. However i cannot play an instrument or write music so it shows you why i'm not in a band like this... =)"
1,total garbage!!,"lillix put out a sorry album ,they cant even decide whether the're pop or some poor excuse for a rock band.Too bad there's not an negative rating on here cause i would give them a negative 5.The're cd titled Falling Uphill is the totally wrong name they should've named it Rolling Downhill cause thats all this cd is worth doing."
2,TOO MANY WAY BETTER BANDS OUT THERE!,A COUPLE OF GOOD TUNESBUT NOTHING MEMORABLEALOT OF BETTER BANDS OUT THERESORRY TO LILLIX FANSBUT THEY JUST DO NOT FLOAT MY BOAT!
3,"Cute, happy, pop","Nothing remarkable, original, startling, or even impressive. But it's all catchy, happy pop rock, and given the television connection I'm sure we'll hear more from these girls. Is a band of all cute girls a gimmick? Sure, but it's not like it hasn't worked before (remember the Bangles?). I know, it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it."
3,too pop,"for me, this was too pop-y. okay- punk? no. they tried to break the pop vibe but couldn't make it. if you're into hilary duff- you'll like lillix."
5,Cool,"Good.1.Tomorrow-The 2nd single, it's really good. 9/102.Quicksand-One of my favorites. 10/103.It's About Time-1st single, it's not as good as the 2nd single. 8/104.Dirty Sunshine-My favorite song. 10/105.Sick-This is good. 10/106.Invisible-Um.....7/107.24/7-COOL! 10/108.Becuase-This is cool! 10/109.Promises-Not too good. 7/1010.Fork In The Road- 10/1011.Lost and Confused- COOL! 10/1012.What I Like About You- Cool! 10/10111/120=5 stars"
4,"Fun ""angry"" girl music","I liked all but 1-2 songs on the album. All in all, very fun to sing with on those ""angry"" girl days, without being depressing. Dirty sunshine is especially funny for those days...A couple of the songs were very... artistic? They weren't exactly my cup of tea, but all in all worth giving a try."
4,Catchy,"The songs are catchy, but they are all a little too similar. It's a good first album, but I hope the second album they're working on now is a bit better. All the songs have the same sound, making it get tiresome by the end. The vocals are beautiful and make you smile. Quicksand is by far the best song. Some of the other better tracks are the ones that differ, the singles: What I like About You, It's about time, and Tommorow."
4,"great CD, lillix!!!","here is my review:1.'tommorrow'-10/102.'quicksand'-10/10 this should definetly be a single, it is so good!3.'it's about time'-10/10 pretty good, although it's a little too poppy.4.'dirty sunshine'-9/105.'sick'-9/106.'invisible'-7/10 way too poppy, and their voices are a little too quiet.7.'24/7'-10/108.'because'-10/10 this song definetly sounds the most punk-rock, it's got really good guitars in it.9.'promises'-9/1010.'fork in the road'-8/10 hard to understand what their talking about in this one.11.'lost and confused'-8/1012.'what I like about you'-10/10 really great remake!!"
2,Oh I am so sorry to say this...,"I just did this tape this morning and I have to say that I was disapointed. He is a very good instructor with a gentle, supportive and informative manner but the tape itself is sort of boring. It is just the basics, a kind of first series run through. For a tape labeled intermediate I have to say that I expected a bit more. I think of myself as an almost intermediate and there was very little challenge here. I kept waiting for the sweat but it just didn't happen. Perhaps the Advanced tape?"
2,ok but not great,"I hate to say anything negative but i did not find this video to be anything special. I like Jonathan's instruction very much but have some reservations about the video. There is very little floor work or work on flexibility as most is focused on standing work. There is lots of repetition. With all this prep I think he should have gone on to a bit more floor work esp since you are certainly warm enough to be very ready for some flex work. and to me it certainly is not an intermediate level video. Advanced beginner maybe. I consider myself to be almost intermediate and and I am 53 yrs old and I did not find much of a challenge here. But all that said, his instruction is lovely. He is informative and very genuine. It is a good tape to use as an alternate I think or when you just want to come back to basics,do some sweating and kind of be on autopilot."
2,Seen one Heat Live..seen em all,"I've seen Beginner, Interm, and advanced. I could not hang with any of it for too long. Its good for others I'm sure. There is too much talk all around. They are so into themselves that they sound as if they just talking to hear themselves or selling a commercial..or better yet ""their"" yoga style. Why such a croweded small room with some people who are like long legged tall and others very short..I get this uneven, cramped feeling..but on the other hand some would think its good replica of live classes and of the variety of bodies in class. Three tapes for commercial boost...all basically the same."
5,Who Was(?) This Beast,"I felt that this was an excellent read. In my opinion Gentry does a very good job of showing the identification of Revelation's beast, using not only Scriptural references, but also the writings of early church fathers as well as Jewish historians like Josephus. I would recommend this to anyone who feels confused as to what Revelation is about or is just interested in reading it from a different, but Scripturally based, persepctive."
3,A bit too much of a good thing,"This highly-detailed analysis of the essay-writing process may be a little too complete for its own good. Germov has done an impressive job of organizing his material. His thirteen chapters are divided into many clearly-labeled subtopics, which are amply developed by means of charts and bulleted lists. No stone has been left unturned in his exhaustive analysis of how to organize, research, draft, and polish a college-level essay. This concise but information-packed volume might serve as a fine textbook for a course on academic writing, but it is not a book that invites casual consultation on the part of young essay writers in search of a few helpful hints. These observations notwithstanding, Germov has done a remarkable job of analyzing the essay-writing process."
5,Great Book!,Compared to Spark Notes and other writing books this book is straight forward and to the point. Germov does an excellent job showing you how analysis works so you can apply it to your writing.
5,Not One Weak Track,"This 1973 folk gem deserves to be put on the same pedestal as the greatest albums of the late 60's and early 70's. There is NO filler, and that rarity alone puts it in very select company. Could you name ten albums, even the iconic ones, that you can say that about? There are four that I know of... The Beatles' SGT. PEPPER, Procol Harum's HOME, David Ackles' AMERICAN GOTHIC, and this one. The musicianship is exemplary throughout, and Ms. Hopkin is in in fine form vocally. That it doesn't have a wider audience is a tragedy, but considering what passes as the music industry these days, I guess it's not a complete surprise. But everyone raised on (or ruined by) MTV who wants to broaden their horizons should give this CD a try. I can't guarantee you'll love it...poor taste in music seems to be hard-wired into much of the MTV generation. But you SHOULD love it. I would give this CD ten stars if I could."
5,Earth Song Ocean Song,We just love Mary Hopkin and this album is no exception. Thoroughly enjoyable. Her voice and phrasing is just wonderful.
3,Missing spacers,"Like the other reviewers, I was unable to create a 1/4 inch tenon using the spacers supplied in the box. The instructions (which are very limited, and of little actual use) clearly state that if I use one 1/4 inch spacer and one 1/16 inch spacer, you will get a 1/4 inch tenon. Unfortunately, that produces a tenon that is about .230 inches (I used my micrometer). Other than that, it seems like a great tool. It appears I will have to make a .100 inch spacer out of something to be able to make this work, and for this price I really expected it to work ""out of the box""."
3,Alternatives,"Note that the picture does not show any spacers. The CMTUSA site shows the same pic without spacers but does mention "". . .included spacers"" in the Product Description. Spacers appear to also be sold separately. Therefore, the problem appears to be with Amazon, not CMT.You can assemble a similar tool from components available on the Grizzly Tools web site for a little less money with more flexibility. Arbor for a router and cutters intended for a shaper can be assembled. Note the spacers, 1/2"" convert to 3/4"". Its all there!"
5,Excellent,"Very well-made product, came in a nice sturdy case.I am very very pleased with the product.Would have preferred it being shipped with more shims of varying thicknesses though."
2,Inside de Cuban Revolution:Fidel Castro and the Urban Underg,"The author's research is flawed. The bulk of the information was obtained by the Cuban goverment. The Comunist party was not involved in the struggle against Batista. They actually were against this type of struggle, and in fact in the 40s they were allied with Batista. Only at the end, when it was sure that the Batista goverment was about to fall they ( the Comunist) joined the ranks of the July 26th Movement."
1,A big disapointment...,"Of all the books I've read on the Cuban revolution and Fidel Castro, this is the worse. Its claim to accuracy, historical insight, and newness is all a farce. The author allows her admiration for socialist idealism to cloud her objectivity, and the book is nothing more than an intellectual tool to present Mr. Castro and the ""Humanist"" revolution in the softest most palatable manner possible. If this is the only book on the Cuban revolution that you plan to read, please go back to the book store and buy a few others so you'll understand what I mean!!! ..."
5,Gripping Story Beautifully Told,"Julia Sweig is one of the world's leading experts on the politics of the Cuban Revolution and in this groundbreaking book she takes her readers on a voyage of discovery. Using secret documents from Fidel Castro's archives that no other scholars have been able to access, Sweig dismantles old myths about the Cuban revolution and gives readers the best overview of this complex process they are likely to get. It doesn't hurt that unlike so many academics she has a writing style that is clear and accessible. At a time when Latin America is once again seething with political unrest, this book is a timely and substantive contribution to understanding the politics and passions of a vital region."
1,Dry as toast,"I never realized someone could take such a facinating subject and make it so boring. I fell asleep reading this book and woke up with the realization that I had absorbed little of the information presented in this dull, dense text."
4,Good for running,"Pros: Very light for running. You do not feel you are wearing them.Cons: easy to scratch them, have to handle them with care. If you drop them is too probable the lenses scratches.Serengueti's plastic lenses are not as good as Serengeti's glass lenses, optics changes when light is reflected on water. Although, you get use to it."
5,Puts Soul into the Needed Pratical Caregiver Tips,"Ms. Lokvig has stepped us through some of the most difficult behaviors and situations which may arise as we try to care for a person with dementia...the information she has lovingly and painstakingly gathered is readily accessible, as a previous reviewer has stated, so that one need not read the entire book to get to what one may need to know quickly.I found the writing has a calming affect and is reassuring. The book is so rich with eamples of how to redirect a sticky situation. I am a professional in the field of gerontology and can recommend this fresh approach to a difficult road without hesitation."
2,Poorly written Beatles book,"I've read a ton of Beatles bios, and this is not one of the better ones. The author tries to make it an academic work, bogging down in minute details and completely losing the charm of the Beatles story. Quotes are added in places that were spoken long after the incident being recounted took place, which doesn't let the story stay in a time frame long enough to get a sense of being there. It just isn't well written. It's not worth space on any serious Beatle fan's shelf, unless you're just collecting all the books about them."
5,Very Informative,"Have been a Beatles fan for many years ,The author put a huge amount of detail into his research and at no stage was I bored.Very informative and interesting"
5,Best musician Biography by far! Very information and interesting.,"Very captivating! A little history, a little music, a little legal, a little home life, a little road life.... Doesn't get bogged down like some of the celebrity biographies. Really enjoyed it!"
4,Its merits far outweigh the flaws,"There are a lot of reviews of this book and many of them mention the book's flaws. Don't let that stop you from reading ""The Beatles"" by Bob Spitz. This is a wonderfully written account of the Beatles' rise to fame and how they dealt with it later. In fact, it's one of the best written Beatle books I've ever read. Spitz's writing style is a joy to read and the story flows wonderfully from the printed page. Are there mistakes? Yes, but what Beatle book (including their own book, the Anthology) doesn't have them? The photo caption with errors in the first edition were promptly corrected in the second edition. This is a monumental achievement which doesn't deserve the load of unnecessary criticism it has received. Read it and enjoy."
1,Mediocre,"I admit I haven't read the whole book, only excerpts. I also looked at the photos, some of which I've seen before and a few new ones. The excerpts I read didn't tell me anything new that isn't contained in other Beatles books (Hunter Davies, Philip Norman). I found two glaring errors in the photo captions. One photo caption purported to show George & Patti at Paul's 21st birthday party. Paul was born in 1942 and turned 21 in 1963. George didn't meet Patti until the Spring of 1964 while they were filming ""A Hard Day's Night"", contrary to another photo caption which claimed they met on the set of ""Help"" which was released in 1965. These are elemental facts known to most serious Beatles fans. If this author can't even get the photo captions right, how many errors is he perpetuating in the rest of the book?"
5,GREAT FIND,"My interests in the Beatles exploded after reading this book. It was enlightening as well as a page turner. If you are looking for a book that covers the Beatles life in an interesting and fun to read way, give it a try."
1,what a hack,"the book is completely biased towards Paul McCartney.John always come across as insecure, weak e jealous of the talent of his partner. I love Paul's music but a book about the Beatles which fancies itself as definitive should be a lot more balanced.And what about the crass factual errors?"
3,Not a Complete Waste But . . .,"I've been binging lately on books about music and maybe that's one reason for my slight disappointment in this book. Stephen Davis has set the bar pretty high and I thoroughly enjoyed the Motown book (Motown : Music, Money, Sex, and Power) as well.So don't get me wrong, this book was solid. It's the first one I've read about The Beatles and it gave me a lot of insight into their lives and their music. With that said, the nuggets about how a certain song was inspired, or how something was recorded, are just too few and far between. I felt there was too much about Brian Epstein and how f**ked up John was and not enough real meat and potatoes. For 850 pages, I felt I should have gotten more ""wow"" moments."
3,The Long and Winding Road,"It takes over 450 pages just to get to the 1st Ed Sullivan Show.. A ""REALLY BIG"" book with a lot that could have been left out. Still in all the second half brings back many memories and answers some questions as well."
5,The story is spellbinding;,The story is spellbinding; I couldn't put this book down. From their childhoods and earliest beginnings in Liverpool through the struggles of finding their voice to the break-up of the band Spitz offers great detail and insight woven into a refreshing complete picture of the Beatles. By far this is best book on the Beatles that I have ever read. It is a must read for any Beatles fan or for anyone looking for insight into an incredible turning point in our culture. I highly recommend this book and I know what I'm getting for many of the readers on my holiday shopping list.
4,I wish i could have seen all that Bob wrote,"Great book, but I found myself wondering about some of the secondary characters in the book. I had read that Bob Spitz had written quite a bit more, but the book was edited down quite a bit. i wondered what ever happened to Dot Rhone (USA Today said that Bob found her in Canada-did she move there with any help from Cynthia Lennon's mother....or what?) and more info about Neil Aspinall's son (hope spelling is ok) with Mona Best would have been cool. And of course, anythingmore specific about Pete's musical career after being sacked would have been great.I was already familar with most of the stories, and the bits I enjoyed most were the occasional nuggets like the three mentioned above. Could have used more info on those"
3,A Long and Winding Book,I am surprised that I am not learning anything new here. The book is over 800 pages long and could have been told in half the space.Not to say that it isn't interesting and worthwhile but not what I was hoping for.
2,fascinating but awful writing,"i loved the stories, i hated the overheated over adjectived over adverbed style.i hear they took 2,000 pages out in editing...they could have lost another 200 without any problem just by cutting the overwrought prose."
1,There are much better Beatle books out there.,"Short and sweet: I've been a mega-fan for over three decades, read nearly every book on the beatles, etc. etc. etc., there are so many misses in this book I've lost count. Example: Just last week I saw Astrid interviewed on PBS about the death of Stu Sutcliffe..... Spitz' reportage of the same topic couldn't have been more different than Astrid's. He got it comp[letely wrong. And there are many other examples to sight, but I won't. Sorry for this short, perhaps inarticulate review. I just want those of you who are considering buying this tripe to know."
1,Credibility suffers,"I was at my local library yesterday and happened upon this book. Only needed to read the captions under the pictures to realize that this book is unreliable. First, George did not meet his first wife Patti Boyd on the set of Help, it was A Hard Day's Night. There are a few pictures that are referred to as having been taken in 1964. One seemed to me to have been taken in 1962, because the boys looked too young and there haircuts were way too short for 1964. There was another photo there which looks like 1965 but it's referred to as '64.I scanned through some of the pages but stopped reading because it lost all credibilty with me bacause of those errors in the captions. Rushing a book is no excuse if that were truly the case."
3,Should have stuck to the facts!,"There's a lot of interesting info in this book, and it's a worthwhile read for that reason. But the author's flowery, awkward style makes it more of a chore than it needs to be. He rarely says in 10 words what could be said in 20, and practically every paragraph has at least one totally superfluous sentence. A good editor could easily have trimmed this tome to half its length without losing any actual information. Spitz also has an annoying habit of inserting ""novelistic"" details and ""reconstructing"" conversations and thoughts as if this was a work of fiction with an omniscient narrator. It just rings false every time."
3,Lopsided,"I'm such a huge fan of The Beatles that I received two copies of this book as a gift during the winter holidays. It starts off fantastic, going into great detail about John's and Paul's early lives. I was excited to get to Ringo's section, since he's my favorite Beatle. Yet, the author barely mentioned George or Ringo at all in the entire book.He wrote more about Brian Epstein than he did George and Ringo put together. Frankly, Brian could be summed up with ""Uneasy with being gay and terrible at handling money."" Paul came across as a whiny, manipulative, pushy overachiever. John came across as a bully. George and Ringo didn't have personalities at all.I don't hate the book. It does have some interesting information. I'm just sure it's not the best Beatles book available."
4,The one to beat...,"There are some inaccuracies, but this isn't a geek website, it's a real biography. Not quite Guralnick level, but this is the best Beatles biography yet."
2,Nothing New,"I heard Mr. Spitz on a radio show last week discussing his book and all the ""new"" facts he has uncovered. For the most part, it is all rehash. Lennon and McCartney were of Irish descent? Nothing new. Liverpool served as a port for R&B records, blues and country western brought in my merchant marines and sailors. Nothing new. If you are looking for a good, more accurate telling of the story, I would recommend Shout!"
2,a hard nights read,"many many errors here. the child in the pic is not julian, george and patti didnt meet as he said, etc, etc, etc. beatles fans know the errors. writing is way too florid and the book is, frankly, boring. WHERES THE MUSIC, BOB?EDIT: i did get my hands on a pre release copy of the geoff emerick book. just finished it and i LOVED it. anybody interested in the actual making of the Beatles MUSIC, and not just gossip about who Brian Epstein had a crush on, will be fascinated. GREAT stuff; it puts you there, in the studio with the Beatles, making THE MUSIC. the geoff emerick book is a MUST read for anyone who loves the Beatles music."
5,Bob Spitz...the Beatles,"initially I signed aboard with the Beatles in 1963....""Introducing the Beatles""....She Loves You , A Taste of Honey , I Saw Her Standing There , Twist & Shout , ect. & ""Meet the Beatles"" ... (shes got the) Devil in Her Heart, All My Loving & Till There Was You, ect. My neighbor told of this book & I ordered a copy immediately... I couldnt put it down ! 900+ pages of intimate history with one of *ROCK & ROLL's*GREATESTS Bands !!!!!"
3,Interesting but flawed...,"Certainly an effort to put this together, but one has to realize this is a story already told in so many books. The ""new"" things are what could make it worth reading. However, I found quite a few places where conclusions are made that simply aren't true.In just a few minutes, I found multiple errors. Which is not good for an ""historical"" book. It makes me worry about the things that I don't know as well - they may be true or not, but it's like court testimony: is the witness credible?"
2,"If the picture captions are this badly fact-checked, what about the book itself?","The first Beatle bio I read wasThe Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles, an admittedly subjective but warts-and-all portrayal of the boys written by an insider that opened my then-11-year-old eyes. No doubt some facts were forgotten or fudged, given the writer's relying on mostly his own recollections. At least he was there! I would still recommend that well-written and juicy book, or the excellentA Day in the Life: The Music and Artistry of the Beatlesover the joke that is The Beatles: A Biography. I think it was the caption that had John holding Julian (a child plainly not) on the Beatles first trip to D.C. that had me howling the loudest. Oh my goodness, if the fact-checkers missed doozies like this, why waste time reading the book itself?"
3,So So,"Yes, numerous errors that are embarrassing, especially the caption of George and Patti! Yet, there are some great nuggets here that haven't yet been written in great detail. Very good descriptions of the recording sessions, especially for The White Album. But again, the auther often makes very sweeping generalizations and that often seem as if he isn't much of a fan. Statements that characterize songs as sub-par, when in fact they are great! Like Hey Bulldog, which the author obviously thinks isn't that great. Also makes remarks about George's writing that seem to suggest his solo work didn't have any merrit.Not that great! Especially for the price and length. Shout is better, as is Anthology."
4,I Thought I knew a lot about the Beatles,"Well, I probably do know more than many people, but I am certainly no expert. I found this book to be very interesting, reminding me of many things I had forgotten since I read my first Beatles biography about 37 years ago. There may be a few errors, but it does make me laugh whenever I read about the origin of a John Lennon song, followed by Paul's recollection that John may have had a line or two finished, but that he (Paul) completed the song and helped with the melody and chorus. It's amazing how much better his memory is, since 12/08/80. If only his songwriting had improved as much!"
2,BELOW AVERAGE -- AND AN INCOMPLETE PICTURE OF THE GREATEST BAND,"There are literally HUNDREDS of books about the Beatles, and over 100 of them are putative ""definitive biographies"" of the band. Yawn...snooze...you've read one, you've read 'em all. And there's holes everywhere in every one of them. Sorry, but the REAL definitive biography will be Mark Lewisohn's massive 3-volume tome, FAB -- due in the next few years. Wait for that one; it'll be well worth it.In the meantime, there are lots of great books out there about the Beatles that are NOT biographies. There's MAGIC CIRCLES by Devin McKinney, THE BEATLES: RECORDING SESSIONS by Mark Lewisohn, and TURN ME ON, DEAD MAN: The Beatles and the ""Paul-Is-Dead"" Hoax by Andru J. Reeve (my favorite book from last year; a comprehensive, enlightening and fun account of the infamous Paul McCartney death rumor of 1969 - which, by the way, is barely mentioned in Spitz's book). Pick up all three of these INSTEAD of this inferior ""work""."
1,Lacks Credibility,"One or two errors in book are not a disaster, but this book has far too many. It's difficult to accept any of the narrative as being true, because of the many blatant fact errors pointed out by other reviewers (which do not have to be rehashed again in this review). The portion about Lennon and McCartney's youth, for example, seems to be made up out of whole cloth. Like the rest of the book, it lacks any basis upon which the reader feels assured that he or she is reading what really happened, rather than some fanciful assumptions that arose strictly from the author's own imagination. Peter Brown's ""The Love You Make,"" for all its faults and gossipiness, is a much more enjoyable read because it at least has the credibility of being told by a semi-insider. Spitz's book strikes out all around, because it does not even have this perspective, at the least, to lend it some credibility."
2,Three Mistakes and your out.......,"This book is to the history of the Beatles what People Magazine is to the history of American Social Life!The Beatles were GREAT musicians, composers and entertainers. When people responded to their music it changed them. Their social influence ranks with Shakespeare.Do we really need another book about the breakup of the Beatles?If you want to read a good biography of the Beatles read Philip Norman's ""Shout.""If you want to understand the Beatles - spend the same amount of time REALLY listening to their music as you would reading this book.I have been a Beatles fanatic for 42 years - since 1963. Any new information about them now is irrelevent as far as I'm concerned - the canon of Beatlemania is closed!!!!"
1,Just Awful!,"A travesty on all levels. There's not a single shred of new information here, and what information is presented is either factually incorrect or lacking in all credibility. How this hunk of junk ever got green-lighted is amazing, but I guess if it has ""Beatles"" in the title, anything is possible.Avoid this book. Stick with ""Shout"" or anything by Mark Lewisohn. But this hunk of crap? Don't bother."
4,I love Dino,"Praise II is called ""Just Piano - Praise II"" but there is an orchestra backing him up and the strings are very complimentory to his piano playing. There is part 1 and part 2 with each song lasting about 16 and 17 minutes each. It is very relaxing and enjoyable to hear the familiar Christian songs being played as a long medley. I believe I got a good price with this album and that is why I chose to purchase it. I love solo piano music and because there was much more orchestra involved is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. For the cost, I couldn't go wrong."
4,The soul of a bean...,"I love the author's approach to bean cookery...the elemental ""feeling"" that the attributes to various types of beans...the taste, textures and energetics both in the bean itself as well as the various cooking methods. She really takes beans to a (deserved) higher level! My only reason for four stars is that frequently the recipes call for slightly odd ingredients which one might not normally have on hand; sometimes I was ready to prepare a recipe only to find I had no garam marsala, (or plantain, white miso, etc.)on hand and that this item was supposedly critical to the final taste. Personally I find it better to experiment anyway, and this gives you the springboard to becoming more adventurous."
5,I Want to Attend this Author's Cooking School!,"An extremely informative cookbook, with one terrific cooking tip, insight or revelation after another. What a gift of information!I also have this author's cookbook on grains (AMAZING GRAINS), which follows the same excellent format.Books of this authority and utility should also be available in hardbound.Two superb cookbooks - one on beans, one on grains, two of the most essential nutrients of what should be every person's vegetarian diet.That's ""every person's vegetarian diet,"" not ""every vegetarian's diet"" - and I am still working on this.This cookbook is so utterly compelling that I want to go to Colorado and attend this author's cooking school (see p. 171) - but only if author Joanne Saltzman is the actual instructor!NB: Re vegetarianism, see the DVD entitled FORKS OVER KNIVES (2011), which the film critic Roger Ebert says is ""A film that can save your lives."" Available on AMAZON.com."
5,"TRU Soldiers don't die, they multiply, UGHHHH!!!","This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. It is a classic beyond a doubt. Every track is tight. If you can still find it, GET IT NOW!!!!!"
3,This is an awesome cd for Master P fans,Well this is a good cd for anyone who likes Master P a lot and Silkk and C-Murder too. But it isn't the same style that new No Limit cds sound like exactlly. But this is still a really good cd but just needs more guest rappers on it. The first cd is awesome and the second is just ok.
5,Best double cd ever!,"This is one of the best No Limit cds ever... check out No Limit Soldiers, I Always Feel Like..., Swamp Aggin, and Ghetto Cheeze. Songs off of this album are on the multi-platinum ""I'm Bout It"" movie."
2,This cd is not as good as the first one,"It seems to me that each year no limit is coming out with worst and worst records. back in 94 when master p came out with The Ghettos Are tryin 2 kill me, all the tracks were bumpin. now when i listened to only god could judge me, all the songs seemed like r&b trassh quality except for ""nobody move"" which is only good becuase of skull duggery. If u want real music get true and ghettos are tryin 2 kill me"
4,RARE NO LIMIT CD.,If you like NO LIMIT RECORDS you should grab a copy as it is hard to find.The best song is I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE which is also a single.This LP helped make no limit.

3,Order in bulk,"Order a few of these as they will not last more than a month or so. They work great when the pins are intact, but eventually if you drop the cable, or receive calls while it is connected, the flimsy pins/connectors bend. Then you'd end up inserting the connector at an angle, and after a few days even that'd stop working. I am stuck with my Sprint Treo 600 till the Pre is out - the charger is definitely something I will not miss when I change my phones."
5,great learning tool,"This was an excellent book for biomedical imaging. It wasn't difficult to understand, and I found it really helpful. I was using it with a class, and it was probably one of my favorite biomedical books."
4,Seventh Sinner,"One of the middling good of Elizabeth Peter' Kirby series. Better, try the Vicky Bliss series, ""Street of the Five Moons"".You'll love John too. You would like Amelia Peobody in the Egypt series. Peter's books are fun."
4,Nice book,"I really enjoyed this book by Miss Colon. It had the right amount action, drama, and even a bit of romance in there. I liked the OCs the author put into the story and the Luna/Clark romance. Wish Luna and the gang would've stuck around longer though :( She and Clark made a good pair. This could've been an ep of the series, in my opinion.I recommend this book, I finished it in a few days (If work hadn't been involved, would've been sooner lol)"
4,does the job,"This scale does the job for my first grader. She used it to help her do her homework and now that she is done with her chapter on measurement, she likes to play with it as a toy. As a toy, it is a little expensive, but as a homework aid for the next few years and a toy put together I feel it is worth the price. The weights that it comes with it are in grams, so I did have to buy some weights in ounces/pounds."
4,Media Control,An eyeopener! Anyone could benefit from this book as it reveals just how the Media has brainwashed us and we have let them. J.Smith
1,Liberal Lies,"This is a typical book by an anti-American liberal. Full of obfuscation, specious reasoning and half truths. Chomsky is right that most of the media is controlled, but he neglects to state that the media generally is controlled by fuzzy minded liberals."
4,Chomsky continues to prove his point...,"It's true that there is little new in the linguistic theoretical treatment of the media in this book. Chomsky uses it to update with facts the validity of the theory he most articulately developed in earlier works. Those who read it with open mindedness intelligence will appreciate and respect his unique contribution to modern thought. It is interesting, but not in the least surprising, that those who write against this book and its author generally, never attack its content with alternative explanations, but continue to vilify and redicule the man himself. It does not go without notice."
3,Not really the man to read,"Noam Chomsky is a good and intelligent writer. However, he is not the man to turn to if you want to study propaganda. If you're interested in propaganda read the following authors: Edward Bernays, Paul Goebbels, and Jaques Ellul. Also, I would recommend reading Carl Jung's The Undiscovered Self. Jung's Discovery of Self will provide you with a perspective from which you can begin to determine what are your thoughts and what are the group think thoughts that have infiltrated your mind. Many people believe they are smart enough to discern between truth and propaganda and fail to study the science. These people are the ones most susceptible to propaganda. They will defend their ""liberal"" ideas or their ""conservative"" ideas. Never realizing that a liberal or conservative idea is a fake paradigm that they couldn't help but absorb from their surroundings."
4,Media control,The media control is the most power weapon of the new empire.Dr Chomsky teka the problem seriosly and wel documnemted.
4,Swiss Tool Ranking,"I bought the item ""Swiss Tool CS Plus, Stainless Steel 115 mm, with Leather Sheath.The tool is very solid and have many variations for repairing things.I have a lot of fun with this high quality product! I was very satisfied with the service of amazon!Best regardsK. Reichwein"
3,Short and Sweet,This book was quite useful for my Reader's Advisory course. It doesn't go into great detail but it does provide a good overall perspective.
4,pretty neat for the price.,"first off, when I received the unit I thought it was rather big compared to the images on the websites. I wanted to share this advice for those people that does not know how to get this thing started. The original ip address of the unit is 192.168.0.20, which means if you have a home network set at 192.168.1.xxx or 192.168.2.xxx, etc. It will not be able to recognize the camera because it is in a different subnet. So you will have to set your laptop/desktop's ip address to that range between 192.168.0.1 through 192.168.0.254 except 192.168.0.20 (since that belongs to the dcs-900). once you launch the crappy wizard software it will recognize the camera's ip address so you can configure it to your home network address.I hope this helped a lot of you. :) It only took me 2 minutes to configure this thing."
1,Very poor customer support from D-link for DCS-900,"I bought this camera just before Christmas, still have not gotten it to work, it is now almost March 2007. The customer support is very very poor, they hang up on you if you ask a technical question. The sofware that comes with the camera is useless unless you plan on using the camera within your network. I would stay away from this product at all cost. I have contacted customer support 8 x, still no luck, I get a different answer each time and they refuse to help if your product has to interface with a another brand of product. They tell you to contact the other manfacturer for help. Stay far away !!!!"
4,pretty good,"Set up was simple, didn't use their software. If you know a little about networking it's easy. If you don't you may have a hard time.The jpg is at ""192.168.0.20/image.jpg (default)"" which may help somebody.Over all I'd say it had a good picture and was worth the money."
4,Not bad for $87 after Rebate.,"Well, I didn't have an issue setting this up. Got it up within 5 minutes with linksys router. Overall is a great camera. The resolutions was superb, and viewing from local network was fast like a video camera. One thing that DLink could make their cameras better is,1. Don't use ac adapter, use RJ45 as a power source. Is possible?2. Changing ip or any changes to the configuration in the software takes too long.Also, use the IPVIEW, this software will make it easier on you when doing configuration."
1,Waste of money,"I don't know whats worse. the camera or the software... IPview lite software was obviously written by someone that doesn't have a firm grasp of the english language.When I access the camera there's about a 50/50 chance it will even work. Sometimes works sometimes just hangs and needs rebooting. The longest I've got it to run (with motion detection on) is around 24hrs. Dlinks web site is ALMOST as bad as their product. Don't waste your time with this product, spend a few more bucks for the Linksys camera."
1,waste of TIME and MONEY,"On my 3rd one, Tsch support told me the first two were defective. Now 3rd doesn't work either. 3 computers, 2 different routers, 3 different cameras. I regret ever buying this camera!"
1,"Hard to beat for low cost , but the image quality....","I bought this camera primaily due to low cost (...) and wireless connectivity. I also use an AXIS 2100 network camera since several years, but needed a wireless camera as well. The D-Link works as advertised and got it up and working with my WiFi router, but I don't know why its image quality is so lousy. I called support, but the said this is what to expect for indoor lighting. As a comparison, the AXIS 2100 camera has a significantly better image quality, so it can be done, but I guess D-Link isn't really famous for cameras. I ended up sending back the D-Link, the new wireless AXIS camera is what I'm waiting for."
2,Image quality won't do,"I've been going through webcams trying to find one that works well, is network ready and costs less than $300.The D-Link DCS-900 does work but the automatic brightness control is constantly changing the picture brightness. It's fine if you're just looking at the picture but when you use a motion sensing capture program, you constantly get false motion triggers.Doesn't work for me."
4,Wish it were in English,"I am a huge Lara Fabian fan. While the title of my review is ""Wish it were in English"" I do have to say that Lara's voice is powerful, beautiful and fulfilling in any language. I finally purchased my first French CD by her, after I read that she lost her US record deal. While I cannot sing along to the songs, it actually makes me listen to her voice more closely. I continue to be impressed by her range. She does sound like Celine Dion (which probably hurts her), but her musicality it ""pure"" as the title of this CD. I look forward to buying more . . . and I wait patiently for her next english CD!!"
2,bad,I'm sorry to say i love lara fabian but this is the worst album she has and i have them all. Most of the songs are boring to listen to and don't have a good beat. Don't judge this album for the rest of her works though. i would recommend any other album she has made except this one.
1,Greatly over-rated singer,"I don't think that she will have any succes in america. Singers like Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and Celine Dion are in a class of their own. Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell Lara that she will never get there."
5,I thank everyday that I discovered Lara Fabian,"As much as I love Celine, Lara's voice is more richly textured, especially in the high notes.If you ever learn French, her French songs are simply timeless. They will grab you with such emotion. You will listen to her CD again and again. Then you will be converted into a Lara Disciple. I have been spreading the Gospel of Lara for years, way before she even reached the big international scene in Karaoke venues.I hope that her next English recording release will have as much passion and intensity as her ""Pure"" album."
5,a new voice new emotion of the french music,Lara Fabian is both from belgium and italy. She has a voice range that varies the sweet smokey bluesy voice to the strong soprano. She has this deep feeling in her voice and she puts all the emotion inside her songs. Compared to Celine Dion and Mariah Carey she has the same strength of voice butin addition she has this litle something that makes you chill when you listen one of her songs. She just recorded a new album called Lara Fabian totally in english and the first title of this album is called adagio a famous classic incredibly well performed by Lara Fabian. This cd is not on amazon yet but i think it should be here soon since it got released in November in France.
1,Skip that one,Simply the worst book from Cussler -I love all the others ... If I keep it will it infect my other books?
3,I Thought the Book was Fairly Exciting.,"I enjoyed this book, but maybe that was because I was listening to it on tape. I thought James Naughton did a very good job of reading this story. It kept my interest through all the tapes. The middle of the book was better than the ending though. I felt that the ending fell off somehow. In the middle, Clive Cussler does a good job of keeping the suspense going and the tension up. I particularly liked some of the characters - Austin's Russian friend Petrov was a believable character, and some of Austin's sidekick's were pretty good too. This book explores what might have happened to the remains of the Romanov family after Russia's revolution. We learn a little about the Cossack culture, and a little about the Russian czars. The high tech stuff is pretty good too. Not a bad story at all."
3,Kemprecos is coming along nicely,"When you get Kemprecos and Cussler together you usually get a watered down, non lethal, Dirk Pitt wanna be. In this novel, Kemprecos asserts his main character Austin as a force to be reckoned with. After several novels that were only attempts to continue on the NUMA genre, this one has finally achieved it's own success.While this story still has some implausabile leaps, and occasionally leaves you, the reader, wondering how that could possibly happen; eventually you suspend your disbelief. When writing alone, Cussler was able to meld his imagination into a story that makes the reader wish the events were real. In Fire Ice, the Cussler/Kemprecos duo is producing the same magic."
3,Good but less than usual,"This book is very similar to Cussler's regular Dirk Pitt books (but with Dirk and Al replaced by Kurt and Joe). The story is as fast paced as usual and many of the same NUMA characters lend support such as Sandecker, Gunn, and Yaeger. He also gets help from the famous naval historian Perlmutter and run across a Russian rival counterpart Petrov, who Austin has crossed paths with before. The basic story is a very rich Russian, Razov, plots to overtake the government of Russia but before he does he wants to seriously hurt America which set Kurt Austin on his trail.The story although good seemed a little more farfetched then his usual and the writing did not seem as clean as usual. Plus it did not have his usual quirk of Dirk having a short meeting with Mr Cussler passing thru going somewhere."
2,"Competent, but not great","The books have become too formulaic. I don't think Pitt was even mentioned in the book, which is a bit of a novelty, as I think Kemprecos' other contributions to the NUMA series have included bit parts for Pitt.It's a delight to read a Cussler book in which he doesn't write himself into the book; I could do without such ""cuteness.""There's no love scene in the book, not much gratuituous violence, and no foul language. So it's PG or PG-13.I don't know why they made this new character 40 years old. If they wanted to introduce a new generation to replace the aging Pitt, why not make him 25 or 30?The book mentioned the recovery of a box from a shipwreck, and (unless I missed it), the only other mention was a reference to the recovery of a box containing an important list. I had expected a paragraph or two explaining how the box was opened and analyzed, etc. Perhaps it was there and I missed it."
2,Boring,"Clive Cussler had run the Dirk Pitt series into a mindless and boring rut, so when his new NUMA files spin-off series appeared it was a welcome change. It was nice to see him give one of his books more than a minute of his attention. Blue Gold was even exciting, like the old Cussler. However, he seems to have run out of steam again. Fire Ice reads just like any other recent Dirk Pitt novel. I wouldn't even care so much that its totally implausible if it was entertaining. But chapter after chapter of what I guess is supposed to be character development...didn't realize there could be so many different characters that I don't care about. Where is the action? If you want mindless excitement, you'll have to check out newer authors like Matt Reilly because Cussler is asleep."
2,are you kidding?,"i was in a bookstore in greece and had a very limited selection of english language books, heading next to istnabul i chose cussler's fire ice. i had heard good things about cussler's dirk pitt series, but had never read one... and now absolutely have no intent to do so. this book was a quick read, yet incredibly predictable and cliched. the plot was mindless and strewn with over-coincidence"
1,Seems to me I've read this book before........,"What do you do if you're running out of plots for a successful series character like Dirk Pitt? Well, if you're Clive Cussler and you like all the moola you've been making off the series,you dream up another character, a spin-off, and use the same plots again. BEEN THERE, DONE THAT, READ IT ALREADY....ONLY IT WAS MUCH BETTER THE FIRST TIME AROUND!!!!!!!!! PHOOEY!!!!"
4,If you like Cussler you will like this,Its basic Cussler. The company saves the world. It is amazing how he can tellit over and over with a completly plot. He never gets boring. This is worth a read.
2,Clive Cussler can do better.,As much as I have tried I cannot say that I have enjoyed this novel. Fire Ice is shallow and boring which is totally uncharacteristic of most of his previous novels at least the ones I have read. The authors seemed to be following a formula but without the usual believable plot. What a stretch!I hope for more the next time.
2,Fun reading but liberal agenda annoying,"Like Tom Clancy, the story comes at you from several angles at once, and includes many well researched aspects from science and history. Only, unlike Clancy, it has these annoying leftist comments thrown in, like the gunshow crack when the bad guys use automatic weapons. Or the crack about the president (2002 c) was really annoying, although it does show how a liberal bureaucrat treats orders from the prez.But if you can get past that then the typical male fantasy action sequences are kinda fun."
5,clive,what can one say about clive cussler he is the best when it comes to suspense and thrills and it does not let you know until the last chapteer
5,More Cussler Fun,"I received this book as a present for my husband during the holidays and finished it quickly. I love Cussler's books, they are fun reading and enjoyable, which is what fiction should be.Fire Ice is a Kurt Austin adventure, ""taken from the NUMA files."" Kurt is one of he newer Cussler characters and he's the head of the Special Assignments Team. In Fire Ice, Austin is after a Russian mining tycoon who is planning to take over the Russian Government, then attack the US with a methan hydrate. And in the fashion of Dirk Pitt, Austin also has a sidekick (Joe Zavala) and in the midst of stopping the takeover of the Russian Government, and subsequent destruction of the United States, Kurt finds time to impress a lady.I think Dirk Pitt will always be my first love (well second love behind my husband) but Kurt can always find a place in my heart too."
2,fire ice falls short,"Although Cussler is one of my faves, I struggled through this one mightily. I couldn't wait for the end; not because it was good, but because I knew that I was about to finally reach the finish line that seemed so far away. This book simply dragged on without interest."
4,Fire Ice,Enjoyed this book typical Clive Cussler from start to finish keep them coming. Read this book start to finish couldn't put it down
4,Cussler delivers again. I really enjoyed this book.,I enjoy the action and adventure in this book. Cussler always delivers action and a little history in his books. Austin and Zavala deliver again.
3,"Cussler, Fire Ice","Fire Ice was my first Cussler read. I went into it knowing nothing about the author and I was very young when I read it so that might be why it did not make an impression on me at all. It was exciting in parts and it was nice to read a thriller that takes place outside of courtrooms and interrogation rooms but the adventure didn't fascinate me beyond a three star mark. It seemed a little bloated with plots for overthrowing other countries and so on. Again, maybe I have the wrong impression, but that is precisely why I have avoided Tom Clancy's massive books. Sometimes the large, sprawling plots are a bit much to take in, or at least they were when I was younger."
5,Excellant,"When I received this item I could have sworn it was brand new. I saw no evidence of this book being read. But oh my gosh, it has almost 1,500 pages. But it will be worth it. Extremely fast service also."
4,An excellent collection of photography and text.,"Galen Rowell and Michael Sewell have compiled their photography of the San Franisco Bay Area's remaining natural areas into an excellent book. The photography in Bay Area Wild illustrates the Bay Area's vast greenbelts and natural areas. For someone who has only been involved in still photography for eleven years, Sewell is an amazing wildlife photographer. The text is extremely interesting and informative--Rowell reminds those of us who live in the Bay Area how lucky we are to have such a wonderful backyard abundant with a great diversity of flora and fauna. However, conservation of our wild places didn't come easy. Rowell discusses the many struggles involved in preserving these places. This is a book I've been waiting for!!!"
5,"Beautiful book, perfect gift","Perfect gift - great alternative to kitsch albums of San Francisco, Golden Gate and other standard tourist traps. Would highly recommend!"
1,Not for the layman,"This book is serious, it contains tons of charts which I believe to be ephemeris, but I'm no expert. Not for the faint of heart, this book had me feeling more muddle-headed then when I picked it up! Also lots of formulas including, one for converting longitude into right ascension with latitude? Whatever that means. Confusing for the layman."
5,Very Nice and great price,"If you love this unusual, sexy scent like I do then you need to try this body lotion. The scent lasts forever (almost :)) and the price can't be beat for a quality perfumed lotion."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"This movie was not exactly what I'd hoped for, even though many movies of this genre from this era leave much to be desired in the first place. It began interestingly enough, and the scenes with the Mosquitos were impressive, however, the movie really trailed off at the end. The final assault on the target was less than gripping, and I highly doubt that it was the inspiration for the climactic scene of Star Wars. Worst of all was the use of models in some close up scenes. A little more effort could have been put into it, especially when it came to blowing them up. In the end, the character development wasn't all that great, nor was the acting. I guess if you're a fan of war movies, you should see this; but don't be fooled, it isn't all that great."
3,The Mosquitos steal the show,"Cons: much of the acting, amateurish special effects and pyrotechnics.Pros: all those lovely Mosquito bombers, and the Panavision aspect ratio (2.35:1).I've watched it twice, but that will be it."
4,633 Squadron Flys High,"Classic 1960's war movie with great action shots, all done without computer enhancement. In color, very few cut in footage, major stars, good story. What more could one ask for. Based on true incidents from WWII."
4,633 Squadron Will Please Mosquito Enthusiasts,"Although the story line of this 633 Squadron is entirely fictional, the air and ground cinematography relating to the Mosquito fighter-bombers is good. There are a few scenes where models have been (unavoidably) used which, by today's standards, are just passable. Overall, it is good movie to keep for all aviation enthusiasts who wish to enjoy watching one of the well-regarded combat aircraft of World War II."
3,A fun WWII movie with great flying footage,"Ditto to the reviewers who gave this film high marks for the great footage of the vintage RAF Mosquito fighter-bombers. The Mosquito was an exceptional aircraft, and 633 Squadron deserves praise for showcasing it.As for the rest of the film, the story line staggers and doesn't fully develop. The end of the film does provide an exciting bombing run that results in the destruction of a Nazi fuel factory in a Norwegian fjord. But it then ends abruptly while there's still some story to tell.The music fits in really well with the flying scenes. All in all, a fun World War II movie, but it doesn't rank as high when compared to others."
2,Disappointed!,"I confused this movie with another I saw years ago which is why I ordered it.The director and screenwriters sleepwalked through their jobs and it shows(I cant believe that James Clavell was one of them!)Even Harry Andrews, as solid a character actor as there is couldnt reclaim this woodenly acted/directed movie. O.K.,I know! The footage of the DeHavilland Mosquitos is outstanding,but it is a shame they didnt get a better picture to showcase their great wartime performance/history.If you are an air buff,watch the Mosquitos perform and snooze through the rest!"
2,Formulaic,not awful just boring. planes bomb using new technique and a few survive. Dam busters was a better effort. Tada
5,Good old movie,This was a Christmass presant for my husband we like the old movies and this one is well made. Old movies can be so much fun to watch not as graffic as movies of today but entertaining non the less.
2,Broken by a 3 year old in 24 hours,"I don't get Thomas the train toys. My boys love them, but for the price, I expect craftsmanship which lasts a lifetime. My boys broke this piece (the spring in the spring-loaded gate) in just one day with typical boy play, nothing violent. I thought this was a fluke until their pricey Sodor Scrub and Shine broke in a month, too (the electronic sound generator stopped working). I have decided this product line is not worth the considerable money."
2,Buried under too much admiration and useless information,"Like an adoring adolescent fan who's been given too much access to (certain aspects of) his idol, Kaplan doesn't seem to know what to do with that other than look star-struck. Kaplan gushing biography buries Gore Vidal under too much admiration and too many useless (and occasionally, repetitive) facts. We learn little or nothing of Vidal as a person or as a writer. Kaplan writes well so even if bored and ultimately without a better understanding of the author in any meaningful way I was able to finish reading the 800 page book."
3,Excessively Long,"A book of near 900 pages, and especially a biography can be particularly daunting. Questions come to mind like: what happens if I die and never reach the end!Kaplan has a great appreciation for Vidal, evidence from the quality of research in this book, and his editing of the best of vidal book.However, the great flaw with the book, is that kaplan at times is to close to his subject. Its inter-subjectivity leaves the reading thinking at times - what would a critic say at this point. The analysis often lacks critical value.Overall, a complete a thorough study."
5,A reader,"This really is a superb and thorough work, despite reservations of other reviewers that are listed here. I find it highly instructive that Vidal commands such high dudgeon out of his detractors after such a long, fruitful life. Methinks they protest too much... Methinks also we need more Gore...Vidal, that is. And others like him, though I can't think of whom. And, please, lest we actually forget to mention Mr. Kaplan, who I find does a great job of holding Vidal's voice balanced with his own.Vidal in his own novels manages a similiar ability to inhabit his characters and yet we can summon Vidal behind the prose. Bravo! I do hope he outlives Mailer and Buckley to write the final word on them, if anybody will care by then. But, we will care about Gore."
2,Skillfully written and researched?,"I think not. How can an author claim to do in-depth research and then have the glaring error of King George VI and Queen Mary visiting President and Mrs Roosevelt on their state visit in 1939? Queen Mary was King George's MOTHER and he was accompanied to the United States by his wife, Queen Elizabeth, who is now the Queen Mother. Sloppy research and editing makes me skeptical of the other ""facts"" presented."
2,Gore Settling Scores?,"The jacket tells us that Fred Kaplan ""enjoyed complete access to Vidal's papers, letters"" but ""was guaranteed a free hand by Vidal to write as he saw fit"". Sadly though the book comes across as an opportunity for Mr. Vidal to settle scores with his old enemies. Mr. Kaplan rarely, if ever, suggests that Mr. Vidal may be the source of the cat fights with his old pals.After an argument with Bobbv Kennedy at a social function in the Whitehouse wherein Mr. Vidal suggests to Bobby Kennedy that the FBI is ""cozy"" with the Klu Klux Klan, they clash and Vidal flees from a ""terrible bad karma in the air"". Quoting the author, Fred Kaplan """"he found himself at a table with Ethel Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's wife and two other equally dull people, a tediousness that flowing champagne helped make tolerable"".It was comments like this throughout the book that made me wonder how objective this bio was ..."
2,"Love Gore, don't like this book","As a long-time fan of Gore Vidal (both the man and his work) I was disappointed with Kaplan's treatment. He is overly fawning of Vidal and looks at all events soley through his subject's eyes. The result is a fawing biography with little, if any, critical analysis or realism about Vidal. Kaplan also has a propensity for constantly droning on about Gore's good looks. Every few pages we are reminded that Vidal was ""handsome,"" striking"" or given details about his mesmerizing pulchritude. Enough, already.There was ample gossip and name dropping, so if you're into dirt on the Kennedy's, Capote or Gore himself, you won't be disappointed. But if you're seeking a serious or even semi-critical examination of Gore, flaws and all, you won't find it here.It's a shame, because few men of any generation have had the brains, wit and talent of Gore Vidal, but he has proven elusive to the picklocks of biographers."
2,This is not an authorized biography!,"I have heard Vidal speaking about this book, and it is not authorized- the author refused to show it to him before publication, and he considered trying to block its publication. Since it came out, he has refused to read it, but has made numerous comments about the author's shoddy research, citing several examples of inaccuracies. The author also continually lied to the press about Vidal, saying that Vidal had asked him to write this biography, which he did not do, etc."
2,"Too Many, Too Much","Too many dropped names dropped too often. Too many references to Vidal's good looks: twice in the same paragraph in addition to every dozen or so pages. Too much repetition--of the good looks, of the dropped names, of the same old childish feuds reopened and redissected too often.And yet there seemed to be some serious omissions. No mention of whether Gore's grandfather, T. P. Gore, was related to the Tennessee Gores. No mention in almost 800 pages of the House Un-American Activities Committee or Joseph McCarthy and his infamous hearings, although Vidal was a person intimately involved in both Hollywood and politics.I rarely think a book is too long, but for this one, I'll make an exception. The book was too long."
2,not completely bad,"rather than seeing the cup as 2/3 empty, i'm gonna try to look at it as 1/3 full. there are 3 good things about this album. 1) ""why i'm here"", 2) ""i walk alone"", and 3) ""how could i?""the only other one you might not want to skip is ""stupid"", as this song is fairly mediocre and not painful at all to listen to"
2,dissapointing,"there is nothing at all special adout this disc. half the songs are bubble gum music. one song even sounds like rick springfield. a couple of decent songs, a pretty ballad if that is what you are into, but otherwise mediocre. very sophmoric lyrics. this band may attempt a second release but if it is not a whole lot better they will be dropped by their label. i can't imagine that there will be another single released from february son."
1,Reminds me of boring 80's music,"This is the worst cd I bought in 1999. Too much like the bad hair bands of the 80's, i.e. Ratt, Poison, Bon Jovi. Boring, too overblown, no real feeling. These guys are in it for the money, not to create art."
2,Throw Back,"Some say that grunge ended metal forever. Evidently unaware that grunge was itself metal; Oleander set out to disprove the elusive myth. They are a throw back's throw back, representing the leading edge of metal before it descended in the self indulgent clichés of the hair bands. Hard, edgy and only slightly screechy, Oleander will doubtless please old Dio fans who are looking for a return to the good old days, when Devils were devils and rock bands thought that loud meant good. To anyone weaned on the alt craze of the nineties, they will just seem dated."
2,Pretty Bad,"There are maybe about 2 tracks on here that are decent and one good track why im here ,the rest is pretty much along the lines of nickelback that makes the ears bleed. This is lamestream music at its worst. Straightforward rock that the radio likes to spit out, luckily even the radio figured out these guys sucked and were lucky to put out one hit I think at most. Skip this save your money, much much better music out there"
4,Killer CD*** Pick It Up,"Awesome CD...sounds similar to Fuel, and goes further that just the single ""Why I'm Here"", so get it, YO!"
5,Oleander isn't another one-hit wonder.,"I've been a fan of Oleander even before they were signed and they rocked then and they rock now. ALL the songs are just plain awesome on the CD, especially ""Why I'm Here"". A great bunch of guys and a great CD. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Great CD,"Like some other reviewers here I intially bought this album purely for ""Why I'm Here"", but was pleasantly surprised that I loved every song. They are absolutely one of my favorites now - you've got to buy this CD!"
3,Oleander is a great unknown band,"If you like their album you will love them in concert, I've seen em 2 times already. Thomas Flowers on lead vocals is a really cool guy. After their show here in Houston Dec. 1st 1999, Thomas walked around after the show signing autographs for all the fans. Oleander appreciates their fans for coming out that is something I respect. But anyway the CD has good songs on it, but my fave is ""Down when I'm Loaded"" cause it is one of their harder rock tracks. I will give it 3 stars out of 5- a decent album."
4,Definately worth the money...,"At first I honestly didnt like this album that much, but it really has grown on me. These guys are really talented. They reminded me of Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Helmet, but more melodic. Some of the songs start to sound the same, but it is balanced out by several stand out tracks."
5,AWESOME ALBUM,I have not yet seen Oleander in concert but I bought the album and instantly fell in love with it. There is not one bad song off it. I love them all and I cant wait to see them in concert with Creed. My one favorite song I relate to the most is Why Walk Alone. A must buy for a rock enthusiast.
1,Nerfed version of the E61,"This phone is a nerfed version of the E61. The phone being unlocked may possibly get around the java restriction imposed on the locked Cingular version, but the processor is very slow (slow menu transition and limited 3rd party app use), the Wi-Fi has been removed from this version, and it's not a 3G phone. Shop around, you can find a much better phone for around the same price."
1,This phone is a piece of garbage!,"I have had the phone for about three months and the keys keep sticking. It doesn't compute when you hang up, so you have to take the batteryt out to end the call! I called At & T and they sent me a replacement... which is much worse than the first one! This one does all of the above with new added problems of cutting off conversations with a loud noise and then blank air! They shouldnt sell this phone.Two experiences with this phone, both HORRIBLE!"
3,"good, but not brilliant","I really enjoy a couple songs on this album, I will say that 'Yes I am a long way from home', 'tracy' and 'mogwai fear satan' are remarkable, but the rest is a bit mediocre. The version of 'summer' is no where near as good as the ten rapid version...still an alright album though."
4,If stars could sound like this...,"...they would sound more like those guys on the cover of a Favorite Cereal of mine. ... Mogwai sounds nothing like a star, not that I know what a star sounds like. I think the stars would agree, though, that Mogwai make some of the best music on planet Earth. Mars is jealous, or so i've heard, because Mogwai have not toured there as yet. Maybe in the future they could take their quote unquote POST ROCK to the red sandy beaches and play to a sold-out crowd near the face on Mars. I'm willing to bet after they play Mars, astronomers peering at the face will see a smile.This album is sheer brilliance. Satan Fear Mogwai for making such great music to fill my ears for years. I think I have almost worn out my CD of YT, and need a new one soon due to repeated listening. COme on, Die young, and purchase this album with haste. I guarantee you'll like."
2,Mogwai: Not my cup of tea,"It's certainly not a horrible album, it's just not very interesting, in fact the whole post-rock genre isn't half as interesting as all the art school geeks pretend it is. Every track goes along at the same slow dirge like pace that you often can't tell where one song ends and the next one begins. Just once you wish they would speed up the tempo a bit and get a good toe tapping rhythm happening. Intead they insist on trying to stun the listener with loud ""emotional"" bursts of guitar feedback in between the boring claustrophobic soundscapes zzzzzz... If you want album that does the same type of thing but much, much better, get Sonic Youth's ""Murray Street""."
1,Young Team...for sure!,"One star - because there's nothing lower. I bought this CD after hearing and reading a lot about Mogwai. What a disappointment! This is a 'nothing' band. Honestly guys, to be fair to the band, I gave them a lot of my time, over and over again, but it just does nothing. In fact it is one of the worst CD's in my vast and varied collection. So pick it up at your own risk. Or do yourself a favour. Click the Exit button and start your search all over again."
1,Can't I give it No Stars?,"Only good use that I can see: Kids just learning to play guitar who want to say as they play in the garage - ""we sound just like a band.""Because it is well known at work that I like Progressive Rock, the security guard lent me this album. This ain't progressive. Let me tell you why it is absolutely horrible.First, the indivdual level of skills in the band are horrible. Second, they play bad together. After 2 years of piano lessons, I could play better than whoever did in a couple tracks.The purpose of the percussionist in a rock group is to be the leader - there were times when I could imagine a far better beat at about 2x or 4x the pace with more creativity. If you want the amaetur hour with a slow, monotonious, obnoxious sound this is your album. Also, if you listen too much to this you will probably warp your ability to enjoy any decent music for the rest of your life."
1,Not popular music,"Was persuaded by the positive reviews (which sounded very educated mind you) to try something different. OK, so I found out I really value rhythm, continuity, and meaning in music. Which means I can appreciate the likes of Pink Floyd but not this inharmonious bunch called Mogwai. This is actually more like Heavy Metal, not ""Pop"", so I wouldn't have wasted my money if it has been properly labelled as such."
4,THE Essential Post Rock Album...,"This cd is great. No, its excellent. It's one of those albums you can put on repeat for days, and no matter what your doing, it is enjoyable. The final track 'Mogwai Fear Satan' is probably their best song, and its just a glorious track. Other standouts are 'Yes! I Am A Long Way From Home', 'Like Herod', and 'Tracy'. Mogwai draws from bands like Black Sabbath (and I swear there is a hint of Smashing pumpkins in there at points) to make beautiful instrumental rock. My not giving it 5 stars is only because several of the tracks (more specifically 'With Portfolio' and 'R U Still In 2 It') are a little weaker than the rest and because of that, almost sound like filler, which is a shame. However, that is no reason to NOT go out and buy this record right away. It is Mogwai at its best, and one of the few reasons to be excited about rock music today."
5,Words Cannot Describe!,"There really aren't... With the exception of track 7, which I can't help but skip this is heaven. I want ""Mogwai Fear Satan"" played at my funeral!"
5,you will get addicted,Mogwai Fear Satan! Simply one of the best freaking albums I've heard this year. It will take you on a sonic journey that you won't want to stop. I'm always a bit sad when I come to the last sone - Mogwai Fear Satan - because I know I will be home soon. You will not be dissapointed.
4,Good Mellow Listening,"Classic Menudo. Just a couple of albums before the made their debut in America, there was Quiero Ser, a collection of some serious ballads that are not just for kids. Check out ""Bailemos En El Mar"", you'll believe you're seated in a beach chair by blue waters with a Margarita in your hand!!!!"
5,GOOD SUSPENSE MOVIE,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE SINCE I SAW IT IN THE THEATRE, SURE IT SOUNDS LIKE A BAD SCRIPT BUT DON JOHNSON PULLS OFF A GOOD BAD GUY PLAYING CAT AND MOUSE GAMES WITH HIS FEMAIL LAWYER. A MAN WHO IS ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS WIFE HIRES A YOUNG BEAUTIFUL LAWYER TO DEFEND HIM AND ADMITS TO HER IN HIS STRANGE WAY THAT HE DID IT AND IF SHE DOSENT GET HIM OFF SHE COULD END UP THE SAME WAY. I COULD SEE DON JOHNSON GETTING A BEST ACTOR AWARD FOR HIS PERFORMANCE. A+ ACTING THEIR. AND THATS WHAT MAKES QUILTY AS SIN A EXCELLENT MOVIE, NOT SO MUCH THE SCRIPT."
3,Johnson & De Mornay Excellent but poor script,It is unfortunate that these two actors didn't have a better material to work with. They are giving the best of them but it is not enought to cover the poor and ordinary script. Too bad....
2,Guilty as Sin,I saw this movie several years ago before I watched it the other day. Rebecca De Morday did a good job on this as she always is great. It just is not such a great movie. I am a great screenplay writer and I would have figured out some better things for the movie if I had made it. Oh well.
2,A ripoff of another movie,"This was a good movie, EXCEPT that the basic idea was done eight years earlier. The movie ""Jagged Edge"" starred Glen Close and Jeff Bridges and was about a lawyer (Close) who defended an accused wife killer (Bridges). She has doubts about his innocence and finds out the truth and then of course, he tries to kill her."
5,Don is perfect!,"The movie is fantastic! Don puts on such a performance that no one could ever say that he isn't a great actor. The script may not be the best but with Don it ranks higher.I am a major fan of Don Johnson so maybe you think I am biased. Just watch the film and see how great it really is. He deserves an award for this film, or at least more recognition of his acting ability.Pay close attention to the scene at his house where De Mornay and him are talking while Don makes a sandwich. Superb!I would love to see this film re-released as well."
5,Compelling,"Very well done movie. Slowly, slowly the plot thickens and one cannot walk away. I enjoyed this thriller very much."
4,guilty as sin,don and rebecca give an expolsive erotic chemistry to this film from start to finish as don character is cold and yet so calculatingand rebecca give more better performance than she did in the hand that rocks the cradle with more twist to this story up to thevery end
1,NOT RECEIVED!,I still have not recieved the book. I am very disappointed in the sender because I needed this by a certain time.......
2,Two ideas a book!,"Some of the history of energy development and usage was interesting. I was disappointed with the lack of depth of analysis about the ""oil break points"" impact on the future."
3,Disappointing Book,"Mr. Tertzakain claims his book ""culminates over two decades worth of readings, analyses, thoughts, and experiences"". However, it has the feeling of a rushed job, aiming to get to the market quickly. Some of his historical statements are clearly ill-informed, and his analysis of the global energy situation is shallow and repetitive.At times, he noses right up against the truth -- as, for example, when he observes that hydrogen is not an energy source (we have to use energy from some other source to make hydrogen). But when Tertzakian speculates about life in 2020, guess what fuel he uses in his car? Elsewhere, he comments that ""Cheap, clean, secure, and discreet were four dimensions of energy that could no longer coexist."" But then he fails to delve into the obvious implications of his own statement.All-in-all, a lost opportunity hiding behind a catchy title."
3,"Good at the start, esp for newbies, but too sanguine about the future at the end","Now, I'm not James Kunstler, predicting we will all be living in caves in 50 years. But, after disavowing magic bullets throughout much of the book, Tertzakian seems more than realistically hopeful, in my opinion, in the last chapter. Read Klare or somebody else for a more sober, and sobering account.That said, this is a good introductory book to Peak Oil and related issues, especially if you're new to all of this. But, especially if you AREN'T new to the subject, you can do better."
5,"Great Book!! History, Economy, and Commodities","This book does a great job of providing a backdrop of the history of oil, ties in many great points on economy, and still relevant in many regards even though some of the items highlighted are dated.I am more of a business reader who enjoys newspapers and mag articles over books, and found this to be something I listen too(since I purchased the audio), over and over again.Other financial books that i've read I believe hold too much of a bias from the author and I believe this one is fairly unbias and represents the history and items to consider very well. The book in itself is a great thought provoker on how one should view the future going forward."
5,Beautiful honest album,"I love this album. I bought it when it came out and still listen to it. It differs from the past Watashi Wa albums in that it is much more folk rock than pop-punk rock. I love the mandolin on ""Broken Man"" and I have always loved the intro to the first song of the album, ""10 Years and Separating States."" ""Father, Son"" is such a personal, honest song; it's also one of my favorites."
1,What HAPPENED?!,"Watashi Wa went from a band with a positive message but a rocking foundation to all out flacid. Sure, the lyrical content is there, but most everything else is NOT. This isn't a great bet for fans of the incredible, ""The Love of Life"" album."
3,Not as good as the first novel,"Like in her last book, Jennie Fields creates wonderful and interesting characters and involves the reader in their lives. What I didn't like were the sex scenes who were a little too explicit and of which there were too many. It kind of gave the book a trashy element which for me didn't fit this otherwise very moving novel."
2,Sloppy research marrs an otherwise mediocre novel,"Jennie Fields may know Brooklyn but she failed to do her research on her characters' backgrounds making the rest of the book totally unbelievable for me. Zoe, the main character, states in one chapter that she met her husband when they were students at the University of Southern California, but later says that they met in the library at UCLA when they were both students there. As Zoe is not portrayed as a compulsive liar, I can only assume that Jennie Fields doesn't know the difference between the two schools and didn't bother to check. This makes me wonder what else in her story is suspect. I realize that this book is a novel, but even novels must contain verisimilitude. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. Ms. Fields' characters also failed to engage me; the dialogue was unnatural and the characters' motivations unrealistic."
4,Cosell on Cosell! His Favorite Subject!,"Howard Cosell is legendary sports broadcaster and his legendary status looms over today's sports broadcasters like a god. He opens the book writing about the 1972 Munich Olympic Games when the Palestinian terrorists shot and killed Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village. Even this incident did not stop the Olympic Games from continuing although he felt that they shouldn't go on. That would have been the defeat of the Olympic Games. He writes about being an American Jew despite non-religious in Germany with the haunts of Nazism only a generation behind and the Holocaust where the killing of Jews and non-Jews were subjugated to inhuman conditions. He also writes about Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali, two great African American athletes who pioneered and championed in their sports of baseball and boxing."
1,This book is terrible,"I like a romance as well as anyone. I not only don't require books be brilliantly written to enjoy them, I don't LIKE literary fiction, or books where the writing is more important than the story. But this book is so badly written that it distracts from the story. If you want a book about gay men in professional sports, read ""The Dreyfuss Affair."" This particular book is really dreadful, and doesn't even have any good sex scenes to recommend it."
1,Cheap Tree for a Cheap Price,"Don't waste your time. No matter how much I tried to fluff up the tree, you could still see all the inside of it. Not near enough tree to make it look decent--very pitiful. I'm sending it back."
3,"Not very full, and too green and shiny","I purchased this tree online and I am not very happy with it. It is not nearly as full as it looks in the picture, and the needles are shiny and plastic looking. I wouldn't purchase a Christmas tree online again."
1,This tree is nothing like the picture,"The tree is not as wide as the picture indicates. Also you need to twist the sections just so it appears to be straight. The top section won't fit properly, leaving a noticable gap. Not worth the $119 I paid for it."
2,"Don't be fooled by the ""list price""!","Ok, so all big artificial trees, even cheap Wal-mart ones, are expensive, but no way does this tree retail for $300+ anywhere. So you aren't getting a bargain no matter how low the price looks. (Reminds me of the old addage about when something looks to good to be true...). That said, I only paid $60 including shipping and I will not have a chance of getting the shipping costs returned at this point, so I am going to hang on to it. The needles do look only about a 3.5 on a ""real looking"" scale of 1-10. It is sparse, but that's OK with me. What I really hate is the way the lights are strung. Very messy - like they were wrapped onto the tree by a chimpanzee. If I had it to do over again I wouldn't buy this tree even at the $60 (including shipping) price. That said, the cheap trees at Wal-mart ($40 range)looked worse. So I guess I got what I paid for, but I did not get a deal."
4,Pretty Tree,"I got this after Christmas, so I haven't seen it fully decorated, but I did set it up and spent 20 minutes or so to separate the little branches. It sets up very easily and the stand is sturdy, separating the little branchlets takes a time but it is definately worth the effort to do this. The needles appear a bit crushed when you first take it out of the box, but they 'fluffed up' during the setup process and after a half an hour had lost that look altogether. Each section is wired separately adding to the ease of set up. This is not a $300-$500 tree but it is a very fine looking tree for the price, I expect years of enjoyment for my investment."
3,Nice Tree,"The tree has a nice look to it. It is very easy to set up and tear down. Unfortunately, one stringer of lights did not work when we received it, but it could be as simple as a bad fuse or something. I have not had time to trace out the problem yet. All in all, seems to be a pretty good tree."
4,"7 1/2 "" Bethleham prelit Christmas Tree",I bought this last yr. (2006) after Christmas on sale & used it for the 1st time this yr. (2007) It was very easy to set up & loved not having to strand the light on it as it was already prelit which made it much easier. I would recommend this tree to everyone.Denise
5,TREE,"SECOND BEST DEAL EVER! I love this tree and it's so slender and tall, it is elegant and very affordable."
1,Pseudo-scholarship,"This is worse than merely amateur scholarship. It's fake. A real scholar with such revolutionary ideas would not be afraid to be peer-reviewed in scholarly journals. Unfortunately, I bought the book without checking up first. This is crank, pseudo-scholarship of the worst kind. Don't be deceived."
1,Does not play well with others,"Stay away if you plan on using this with a Linksys router. Nothing I tried, over the span of two days, would get the thing to work for more than two minutes. Even putting the unit next to the router, 2 inches away, and it couldn't see it half the time, the other half it'd drop 90% of the packets.Your mileage may vary, but note that this isn't the only review to highlight issues with Linksys routers."
1,D-Link DWL-G810 sucks,This Wireless bridge completely sucked. The firmware was buggy never saved my information. It said it supported WPA which it did not have any fields for it. If i did get it to connect to my access point it would immediately disconnect. D-Link had always cool looking devices. This was a square plastic cheap box with a giant D on the front of it and a big annoying light on the front. This product could use a lot of redesign. Specially the firmware. I would not recommend for a wireless bridge.
1,Not a Bridge in the strict sense of the word,"Can only serve an IP to a single machine and not a network,so NOT a bridge in the strict sense of the word.If this were made clear, I would rate it 4 star, for thefirmware is often unstable, but otherwise it works well."
1,Worthless,"This isn't a wireless bridge, it's a wireless jammer. It works for about 60 seconds, bridging flawlessly, and then it jams my access point hopelessly (it won't work again until the DWL-G810 is turned off for good and the access point is power cycled). And this is after flashing the unit with the latest firmware. The firmware that shipped on the unit was 2.13, which the D-Link website says is beta firmware and not to be used for anything but testing. Say what? They shipped that?I should note that I tried it with WPA encryption. The unit may work better with no encryption, or perhaps with WEP. But those modes are unacceptable, especially in an 802.11g network, where you expect WPA as a matter of course.Beware this unit, unless you're in the market for an 802.11g jammer."
1,Too bad DLink dropped the ball.,"I am usually a fan of DLink products but they really dropped it on this so called bridge. This is absolutely not a bridge. If you are looking for speeds slower than 802.11b this would be perfect but DLink insists on using terms like ""turbo"" and ""extreme"" Two tin cans and a piece of string communicate more effectively than two of these relatively pricey units."
4,Interchangable firmware,"This may (or may not) void your warranty, but the firmware on this product (DWL-G810) and the AP product (DWL-G800AP) is interchangable. This may be more useful for people who purchase the AP/Repeater product and find it useless (since the repeater is only compatible with a few select D-Link products).I purchased a DWL-G800AP by mistake, intending to purchase this product. I'm happy to say that, after switching firmware, I'm bridging my network at 54mb/sec. The web interface even says DWL-G810 on it. All thanks go to D-Link for keeping production costs low by introducting two identicle products and marketing them in different ways!"
5,Very Easy To Use,This cord allows me to mount the battery tender in my garage and simply plug the cord into my boat. It makes it very easy and hastle free.
3,Protective Cap Missing,Dinged 2 stars for missing one of the protective caps. They are used for a reason.25 feet is excessive for my application. Although it is better to be too long than not long enough.
3,Battery Tender extention cable,"For some reason I was thinking this cable was for the power source, but it is for the clamps that connects to the battery. So if you need to charge several batteries that are sitting away from the charger you will need several extension cables. For someone with my needs (2 banks of 4 batteries that need to be charged at a time) $9-12 a pop it is not really worth the $$ in my opinion when you can just buy one extension cord, but I'm sure I will use it one day."
5,Good quality,I use this extension wire to reach my generator on the other side of the garage. This cable was the perfect length and appears to be well made and able to withstand the garage environment.
5,A convenient extention cord.,This 25' extention cord enables you to position your MC further away than the stock cord that comes with most battery tenders. It came to me well packed and in a timely fashion. I highly recommend this to be a part of your maintenance charging system.
5,extension cable for battery tender,connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck / battery charger unit is in garage works perfect.
5,Battery Tender extension cable,"The cable is pretty heavy gauge with Battery Tender type quick disconnect connectors. While the picture does not show them, each cable end actually has a connector cap with molded lanyard to protect the connector when not in use. As with all long cables with multiple connectors along the chain, there is a slight voltage drop of about 0.2V depending on charging current. The connector is same type used with various car battery accessories and compatible as long as polarity is checked to be sure. I do not use these cables with Battery Tender product, but rather with my own charging power supply. I cut off one connector and put on color coded banana plugs to plug into my power supply."
2,Don't bundle with non-matching merchandise,"I'm sure the cable is fine provided it is bundled with matching product. It's heavy duty for sure, but it did not match up with the Sunforce solar charging unit I purchased with it (which I did since it was a recommended bundle and I needed to extend it further). I ended up cutting the cord on the Sunforce charging unit I bought and patching in my own extension wire."
5,Size does matter,I would not be able to use the 4-bank charger I purchased if not for these extended cables. The cables connected to the charger are woefully short.
5,BATTERY TENDER 25 FT EXTENSION CORD,"REALLY NOT MUCH TO REPORT ON THE PRODUCT, ITSELF, AS IT IS JUST AN EXTENSION CORD.....BUT THE COMPANY WAS EXCELLENT TO DEAL WITH AND GAVE ME PROMPT DELIVERY"
5,Great length,I bought this extension cable so I could reach my motorcycle. My garage only has one outlet in it and it's on the other side of the garage. I didn't want to move both cars just to be able to plug in my bike to charge. The extension cable has a great length and durable feel to it.
5,"A ""must have"" accessory for the Battery Tender",With the extension I plug in and setup my Battery Tender in the garage. Then run the cable under the garage door out to my RV.I tape a small strip of plywood next to the cable so the garage door doesn't smash the cable.
5,Battery Tender,"Needed this for my car as off Island alot and didn't want the battery to die so purchased this and it works awesome, would highly recommend"
3,Length ? - Width ?,Would like to know the size of this product before i buy. I can't compare value of product with limited info. please list more specific details of this polyethylene sheeting.
5,Love this book!,"This is a fabulous book, painstakingly researched and artfully written. See my full review on a blog about the Athens music scene: (...)"
4,Very lightweight and easy to use.,"Very lightweight and easy to use. Folds up and fits in a fairly small space. So far, so good. I really like being able to buy online and go to the store and pick it up the same day."
4,Hard to lock and unlock,"I understand the fact of making this stand not so easy to unlock. You wouldn't want to accidentally unlock it while on the top step. Even though I don't know how in the world that could happen. This stand is light enough for my 8 year to move it around, but again he has a hard time locking it down when unfolded. Big steps are nice. The top handle/rail is nice to have where you need to reach out a little bit. Compared to the Little Giant Three stepper, this is just as good, and cheaper."
4,Sturdy,This is a good sturdy ladder. Not too heavy to carry but takes a little effort to snap in place & fold up but I feel confident it will stay up.
4,"A little heavier than I expected, but the price is right!","This is a great step ladder, sturdy, safe and easy to fold. The price is just perfect so you can't go wrong with it. I bought it for my office and I expected it to be a little less heavy (like the one similar to this one I have at home), but I'm very happy with it."
5,AVP Fivw Stars,"I am so glad I ordered this stepladder. It is sturdy, easy to fold and unfold, and is made so it can't scratch the floor. Well worth the money! I highly recommend."
4,Well worth it.,"The stepstool is sturdy, and takes up very little room up against a wall. In a NYC apt., this is vital."
5,the werner step ladder,I received this step ladder in two days. I love it. I read the reviews of it being hard to close. I do not find that to be the case. It opens and closes easily and I know I will find many uses for it. I wish I would have had it to put the top on my tree so my angel wouldn't have looked drunk.
2,Difficult to close & too heavy,"Handsome stool, very sturdy and excellent foot base. I personally found it to be too heavy for my strength and almost impossible to close."
2,A real pain to open & close; finger smash risk when fighting it.,"If you open it and leave it open it's great although rather heavy.Unfortunately unlike the 2-step variety of similar home step stools, it does not simply open or close without a fuss. In fact it is a major pain in the rear to either open or close. The latch that needs to be released to close it moves easily, but then nothing happens - it still won't close without smacking it and it is not obvious where to do so. It certainly does not simply open or close by pushing the legs in any obvious way.Just now I smashed a finger it it just opening it.If you want something that opens/closes effortlessly, look somewhere else. If you don't mind having to kick or smack it, it's pretty sturdy."
5,Excellent and Secure,"This is an excellent step ladder. Just purchased it today from Lowe's on sale for $39.00. It has excellent grip points on the handle, the steps, and the base. And when it's locked in position, it feels very strudy. I use a step ladder to wash and clean the top of my SUV and a previous two step model I used slipped one time and marked the side of my truck. So, I wanted something a little safer and this one fits the bill."
1,"No Instructions given for closing and opening, VERY hard to close","This product comes without any instructions for use.From folded position, it's pretty intuitive to open, But, once opened, it's very difficult to know what to do to close it for storage.I phoned the company, and even the rep really didn't know much about what to do. Putting together his scanty instructions with a bit of common sense, I managed to close it - though it was physically quite difficult. Indeed, even somewhat dangerous, as one's finger can get crushed in the process, as mine did.Eventually, it becomes easier - but never anywhere easy enough.Badly engineered."
4,good step stool,"Great price, as advertised, sturdy. Wish I knew amazon had the step stools many years ago. Needed good step stools for over 5 years, but most were unaffordable. This stool will last and keep you safe when you need it. No more standing on chairs and taking chances of falling."
5,EXCELLANT!,"Awesome, strong, compact, wonderful, wonderful, WONDERFUL! Just what the doctor ordered! I am 5 foot 2 inches and have difficulty reaching the top shelves in my linen closet, clothes closet and kitchen cabinets.Excellant quality, folds easily and can hide it in my laundry room. I LOVE IT!This is my 2nd one...I keep one downstairs and one upstairs.Great price, great value, great packaging! 5 stars!"
5,Excellent!,Extremely sturdy and doesn't slip. Has made my life much easier (and safer!). A little difficult to open and close.
1,christmas tape,"I got my package very quickly but, the tape inside the case was the wrong tape. I sent it back."
5,Great for the entire family,Both me and my daughter love Braceface. I wish that it was televised here in our state. We need more shows like this for children to enjoy. Most episodes have some kind of meaning to it. We just love it.
3,It Has Its Moments,"It's about time that a (white) female artist comes out who doesn't over-sing or imitate Whitney Houston. It's refreshing to hear someone sing in their own voice and know that it's coming from within. Moving on to the CD. The music on here could be classified as R&B, even there are some pop overtones. Most of the songs were okay, but nothing that would grab you. I wasn't too thrilled with the synthesized music and Nikkole's vocals would've been better accompanied with real playing instruments. Nikkole has a good voice, but she needs to work on finding her own style. From the way I see it, these songs could've been performed by anybody. She should add a little pizzazz and stay away from any pop influence."
1,Terrible. Period.,"This product seemed like a great buy at first, but even when I followed the directions carefully and pulled off the paper in the correct direction, it ripped off my skin, and not my hair! Now my face has been hurting for a week. Save yourself some pain and just don't buy it!"
1,No Effect Whatsoever!,"I have tried a few wax strip kits, and this is the worst product ever! I followed the directions for each strip for each body part and the strips had no effect whatsoever. There was practically NO hair removal. I even tried heating the darned strips for 30 seconds before application - only then did a small amount of hair come off on any body part! Now, I'm not hairy Hannah or anything, but these strips wouldn't help even if I had one strand (trust me, I tried on one strand with no success!) Run, don't walk away from considering this option; it's a waste of money. Use Veet or Parissa; both are much better."
4,Works great on face,"Have been using it for long for facial areas like eyebrows, upper lips etc. Works great, saves money and also can be cut to suit needs."
1,doesnt work,i got this thinking it would work at least somewhat but it didnt work for me at all. all it did was leave my skin red and sticky and took off no hair.
3,Works well for eyebrows,"I've used these strips on my eyebrows for several years, and they've always worked perfectly. However, I tried them on my bikini line, and they removed very little hair. They aren't as painful as others, and the finishing oil is amazing! I would recommend these for eyebrows but will search elsewhere for a good bikini wax."
3,Average,"I used this product several times on my eyebrows, but it took a lot of time and practice to get it working right. You have to cut the strips into the right shape and then rub them between your hands to activate the wax. I didn't really get to master the art good enough, so i don't use it anymore."
1,Cant wash off,Bad product. I get lots of pimples after using it and the wax/glue won't wash off.Will not buy again!
1,Waste of Money,"What a colossal waste of $7.Yes, I read the directions carefully, warmed it and applied as directed.Glue sticks to both sides of the plastic, so you don't get a great seal onto the skin. Alot of pain for only 30% hair removal - not worth it."
1,"bad bad, it burn skin","Thinking about trying instead of going to salon, but it was a big mistake. I read and follow the instruction, applied to my upper lip (that's a big no no), then pull the strip according to instruction. It burn bad and left a red mark. I should have tried on hidden area first. Please do yourself a favor, do not BUY this production. I am going to write my review to all sites related to this product. It is horrible and inhuman. STAY AWAY."
1,Gave me hives!,"I tried this product just once for my eyebrows... or shall I say eyebrow. At first I was impressed that removing the strip wasn't as painful as I had anticipated. I put the lotion on and examined the results. Within seconds I started to break out in hives that looked like blisters! I had to scrub the area with soap and water and then keep an ice cold compress on my skin for it to go down. After the hives finally went away, I examined the area- the hair was still there! That was last night. This morning I woke up and my skin was STILL red where I used the strip. So this wax somehow miraculously removed my flesh, but didn't take my hair with it. I will NEVER use this again!"
2,Not the best,I've tried the product once and didn't like it...i've used it on my legs and arms..it irritated my skin so bad and it didn't remove all the hair...I don't recommend it..
2,Ineffective,"The wax strips remove hair, but only about a third of it. You have to use a lot of strips just to wax your bikini line. Plus, when you warm them up in your hands, you warm up two at a time, but only use one at a time - so while you're using one warmed-up strip in a set, the other one cools down and it's hard to warm it back up without making a mess. It also hurts quite a lot for something that doesn't remove very much hair."
1,worst hair removal product ever or maybe I just got a bad box,"Buying this product was a waste of money. using it was a waste of time. It did not work. It was huge sticky itchy mess. If it wasn't 8 days away from Christmas, I would have took it back to target where I got it from. I tried every single strip in the box. The result I pretty much have the same amount of hair that I had before using it. I tried it in several different places."
3,Takes several tries to get all hairs,"I wouldn't buy this product again. I have been getting professional waxes for years and decided to save some money and wax my lip at home. It takes several tries for the strip to pull out the hair, and each go-round irritates my skin a bit more. The finishing oil is really nice, and it's convenient that, since the wax is already on the strip, there's no mess. It is a much cheaper option, of course, than going to the salon. But I plan to buy another product next time that will get the job done more efficiently and won't cause so much irritation."
2,Bleh . . . .,"Sally Hansen . . .Has failed me. First of all it was a pain to get the strips warm enough to use (you do it by rubbing the strips . .apparently the friction and the warmth of your hands are supposed to be good enough . .HA). Second of all, after the hassle, not only do you have raw hands (maybe there's a better method . . .), but you have to rush to wax your face/bikini/whatever . . .And after all that, you get fruitless results (at least I got fruitless results) . . .The only thing it worked for was my bikini area/stomach (and even then there were multiple stray hairs . . .I had to do it again and again and again) . . . lips and eyebrows were a no go . . ..I think I may have gotten just a single hair when I did my lip (but then again . .I have yet to find anything that works for my lip).In conclusion, do yourself a favor and try something else . . ."
1,Didn't remove a single hair!,"i tried these strips more than once, and on different body areas, to make sure i wasn't just doing it wrong. maybe i'm just not heating it enough in my hands, but these wax strips are ALL THE PAIN WITH NONE OF THE BENEFITS. didn't remove a single hair, but still hurt pulling it off, and it made my skin sticky. i'm going to try to get a refund."
1,NO EYEBROWS!!!,"I thought that you just pressed where you wanted the hair removed, but nope! Took the whole flipping thing off! And I can't get through to their 800 number. Don't use these unless you want it all gone!"
2,"Works on light, fine hairs only","Worked well on lighter, finer hairs. As for dark, coarse hair (ahem, bikini line), did nada, even after multiple retries."
3,"Not the best, not the worst.","Sally Hansen Wax Strips have removed most of the hair when used on my face, but occasionally it takes a little bit of skin with it. Until recently I thought it was the best I could find until I tried the Veet Wax Strips for face. They seem to remove even more hair and haven't irritated my skin."
4,Better than using hot wax,"After a disaster with hot wax, I decided to purchase these. I wasn't sure what to expect for 7 bucks. I read and followed the directions carefully. It did remove some hair, just not nearly all of it. I think I pulled wrong. I pulled UP but think maybe I should have pulled OUT away from my face. I think, with practice, it will work better. I've read many reviews complaining that the wax didn't come off for days. You have to use the blue liquid that came with the kit. When all else fails, READ THE DIRECTIONS. It tells you to apply it with a cotton ball afterward. It takes the wax right off. My only concern now is stubble. It seems today that my upper lip feels stubbly, similar to the way your legs feel the day after you shave them. I didn't want stubble!"
3,doesnt remove all hair,"i used this product to wax my eyebrows, and it worked well, just not always in one strip as other products. sometimes i would have to wax the same area 2 or 3 times."
5,Wonderful Time of the Year,"""Wonderful Time of The Year"" is another good one by Dino. I love it. Recommend it to all Dino fans."
5,Excellent collection,"This is an excellent collection, well worth the expense. It is diverse: poetry, reviews, personal anecdotes,history, politics.... from writers from the USA (including African American and Native American), Ireland, Ghana, the Dominican Republic, Palestine, Germany and beyond. I purchased this book as a kickstart to my PhD thesis on women, writing, creativity and the home. Although many of the contributions are written by academics, it is notable that several are not; I feel that it would also be an enjoyable read outside of academia."
3,"Revealing and helpful, but at a price....","Enormous fun, very helpful for bringing Pynchon down where we mortals can begin to digest, but I had to set it aside; Wesenberg drops too many subtle and not so subtle hints about events, characters, and places that have yet to be introduced. (viz. I'm on p. 136 of the novel and I already have a pretty clear idea not only of many future events, but of how the book concludes.)"
4,A must for any serious reader of Gravity's Rainbow,"The amount of research that must have gone into this book is mind-boggling. It provides background and clues on most if not all of the allusions, puzzles, etc. contained in the novel. The only annoying thing is that Weisenburger gives away the ending of the novel at the beginning of his book."
4,Good starter for beginners with some knowledge of German!,This is a good course but not for a complete beginner. One must know some German. Exercises are extensive. Conversations are limited to dialogues but not in exercises. The entire course is rather enjoyable. I highly recommend this course. Must compliment with other series.
4,Where is the genitive??,"This book lacks any information on the genitive in German..... can't imagine Germans down own anything!!! It also has all grammar tables headed der das die, not der die das as I had learned years ago in school. Obviously, that's more of an annoyance than anything. If it wasn't for all the exercise questions in the book I would have given it a 3. The book is ok but there must be better out there. Surely??"
4,The Handyman Strikes Again!,"An employee in an investmant house discover a shady investmentby her boss.She turns him into the SEC and a full blown scandalerupts.Her boss is payed a visit by the villian in the Gatekeeperthe Handyman and commits suicide.There is even a deeper scandalinvolving prominent and powerful figures in the power elite of the government. Sloane Ryder,the investment house employee ishired by the GAO after being blackballed by Wall Street.Shediscovers the scandal and begins an investigation.She discovers aconspiracy to assassinate the President of the United States(thewidow of the Presidential contendor in Gatekeeper).Ryder is in for the fight of her life trying to expose the scandal and stopthe assassination plans of the Handyman.An exciting read.You willenjoy this book."
5,Praise for Shelby,"Shelby has done it again. First rate material. I could not put this down even in lieu of sleep. I had to get to the end to discover just how it all worked out with Sloane Ryder and the Handyman. Sloane Ryder is a very believable character. Enjoy this, but don't let it be your only Shelby read. Picked up Days of Drums in an airport somewhere in 98. Have been a committed Shelby reader since. Take the time to read them all Days of Drums, Last Rights, Gatekeeper"
5,awesome,George Strait is a beautiful man. This album is wonderful. I hope he never stops making his great music.
2,It is the same George CD . Same simple music all the time,George Straits albums never changes. He has one or two good songs and the rest it not worth listening to. It sells because it is George Strait not because it is a good album. His title says it all. Alway the Same forget never.
5,George strait always a 5,"Now this guy can sing. No matter what if your happy sad or whatever, he has a song for your mood. I listen to nice country music not honkey tonk, But he is definately one of my favs"
2,You've got to be kidding,"This is the same old - same old. George Strait has not had an inventive musical idea in the last 10-15 years. He is so far removed from his best days that it is not funny. And there is no reason for it. GS could be turning out some great albums, he still sounds fantastic. But he is on autopilot and you can tell. Whoever it is that is choosing these songs - be it GS or someone else - needs to be canned immediately. They are horrible. GS has completely changed his style and has become part of the modern country music scene...that's too bad. Don't expect any more albums as good as ""Does Ft Worth Ever Cross Your Mind"" or ""chill of an Early Fall"". He'll just keep churning out this uninspired music until his career ends...because people will keep buying it. He hasn't had a decent single since ""She doesn't like me anymore"""
4,Easy Listening,"Like all George Strait albums, this one is easy on the ears. Although no songs particuarly stand out, with the exception of ""Always Never The Same"", and maybe his recent smash ""Write This Down"", it is a very refreshing departure from the likes of Shania Twain, Dixie Chicks, and other soda pop sensations. Overall, any George Strait fan will appreciate this disc, but some other country fans might want to try some of his older material first like ""Carrying Your Love With Me"", or his boxed set."
5,A great album that goes deeper to thought after each listen.,"This is a fine album! It doesn't grab the listener with a catchy tune right away, but more than makes up for it in later tracks. ""Write This Down"", ""Peace of Mind"", ""Always Never the Same"", and ""One of You"" are fun, drive with the top down tunes, while ""Meanwhile"", ""That's Where I Want to Take Our Love"", and ""4 Minus 3 Equals Zero"" are musical poetry! This is a wonderful album to own."
5,A voice that is smooth and velvety,"It doesn't really matter what George Strait sings, it is his smooth and velvety voice that makes his music great. Buy this CD. It sits right up there with the others. Thanks George for staying always never the same!"
3,It doesn't measure up to previous efforts.,"While this album has some nice songs in it, particularly ""That's The Truth"", ""Meanwhile"" and ""4 Minus 3 Equals 0"", the rest just sounds rather bland, compared with the last 3-4 albums Strait has released. Too many of the songs here seem like ""filler"" instead of classics, like in his previous albums. When compared with masterpieces like Blue Clear Sky, Fort Worth...and Carrying...this albums just doesn't measure up."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"George Strait did it again! His 20th album and he is still the best country artist ever! He knows how to pick good songs That touch people's hearts. This Cd brings back traditional country music at it's best!(The way it should be!) My favorite song off this album is definately ""One Of You"". If Your a big George Strait fan like myself, you won't be dissapointed-get this cd!"
3,strait away..,"It was good, but not as good as some of the previous ones. George always entertains, however, he is beginning to be repetitive."
3,Good...Solid from Start to Finish,"Overall, I do like this album a lot. With each listen it grows on me in a positive way. I would say it is not as good as some of his best work from the late 1980's and early 1990's....But it is a solid effort and better than 95% of the other ""Country Music"" that is out there these days..."
4,Strait to the point of what country should be in 2000!,"I am a very big George Strait fan and have been since the beginning. This album, I have to say, is definitely his best since ""Easy Come, Easy Go"". His vocals seem to be getting better as time goes on. A must for your collection, and even a good place to start if you're not a George Strait fan. Now that's going out on a limb, so it must be good."
2,Red Telephone,"The telephone works well, but it is way too small. It is more suitable for a small kid. I was really disappointed in the size."
4,The Rest of the Story...,"Here is the description from Bealls' site. I hate not having adequate information about a product so I thought I'd share. I haven't yet purchased it but the other reviews are positive. Price seems fair and shipping is average.""Open an aroma of sweet fragrances and go beyond the mood of calmness. Glass jar is filled with 3 oz. of scented oil and six reed diffusers. The aroma will be absorbed through the reeds and released for a few months depending on its envrionment. """
4,Rose Diffuser,"I love the smell of roses and this product keeps my room smelling great and lasts a long, long time."
1,Doesn't last long,"It's pretty fast, smooth rotation. The only problem is the handle cuts into the rope. Used it for 5+ hours and the handle is slowly cutting into the cord."
3,good for rookies!,this is an ok jump rope for beginners or people with low impact workouts... also good enough for one user only. I've used them in my gym for several customers and they break easily within a week... so I suppose they are ok for personal use!
2,cheap rope - ok for short time,"Decent jump rope, but probably will not last long, the rope is already creasing where it hits the handle, and i've only used probably a total of one hour or so. Tangles easily, good length for my height, i am just under 5'6"" and it's plenty of rope.Will be purchasing a leather jump rope that will last longer."
4,"Good rope, great price",This jump rope is a good prodcut for a great price. It is easy to adjust and does exactly what I need it to do. Shipping was quick and I received the rope earlier then expected.
5,Best ever jacknife,"This is, in my opinion, the best knife that Victorinox makes. Everything that you need for a backwoods camping trip fits int a cell phone-size case. The little screwdriver that fits into the corkscrew can be used for anything from eyeglass screws to computer circuit boards (I've used it for both). The sandpaper striker on the matchbox works really well, usually lighting the first time. I am 15 and work as a maintenance man for a small art store, which often involves taking printers and whatnot apart. With this knife I very rarely have to get any tools to fix it. I also checked airline regulations, and the kit can be carried in luggage (not carry on, obviously). If you are a handyman, camper, or just a knife enthusiast, I would recommend this knife hands down. You will not be disappointed at all."
1,STAY AWAY,"I lost over 300 excellent shots thanks to this card. I've tried everything -- the pictures come back corrupted every time. Sometimes it will be just a few pictures, other times it's the whole card.PNY Tech Support is absolutlely the worst I've ever experienced in my life. 2+ hour waits on hold to get hung up on. What good is a lifetime warranty if you can't get through to the company!Stay far away from all PNY products -- that's what I'm doing forever."
1,Mine lost data as well,"I purchased one of these from Amazon about a year ago. A few months back my computer and camera are unable to read it. Lost pictures, not happy. I treated the card well and it rarely left the camera. I have yet to see if they will honor their warranty but I still wouldn't suggest this brand since reliability with something like this is of the upmost importance. It is also an extra big deal that I have to return it since I have personal photos on there that I do not want some guy at PNY looking at and showing around work and even possibly spreading all over the web. Finally, I doubt I need to mention how much it sucks to lose files and data. Big thumbs down for PNY from me. Will not buy from again."
1,All Cards NOT Created equal...,"I was always a believer that all media cards were created equal. Whether a San Disk, Lexar, PNY, or SimmpleTech card, it didn't matter, each worked as well as another. Well, I was wrong. After one use, just one single use, the PNY card stopped working! Just one use, I couldn't believe it!In my line of work, I sometimes put my camera and media cards to the test. I use San Disk cards (which have never failed me), but one time I needed an extra card and had to settle for a PNY. That turned out to be a big mistake. Luckily I was able to return the card and get my money back."
3,Works for me. :),"I bought this PNY CompactFlash card 4 months ago for my Nikon Coolpix 3100 camera, and have used it all summer, taking about 600 pictures. I haven't had any corrupted pictures, or problems. The speed of the memory is the problem. When the flash is used, it can take up to 10 seconds to save the picture. That is frustrating. Is it the camera, or the CF card? I would look for a card with a higher x4, x8, x12, x40 rating. I don't even know what the x rating is for this card. When I bought my camera, this was the only card available at the time of purchase. If I had to do it all over, I would buy faster CompactFlash memory."
1,Don't B-U-Y P-N-Y,"I purchased a PNY 1GB compact flash card from a local retailer. I put the card in a brand new Canon Rebel 300D, snaped a few shots to test the card... Images came back striped, with strange colors and patterns often taking up half the image.Worried it was the camera, I switched back to my eMedia 256MB card took a fewshoots of the same subject, everything was normal. No stripes, no strange colors.Still not convinced it was the flash card, I repeated the process, putting the PNY CF back into the camera. Stripes, colors, patterns again!I thought this may have been an isolated case, until I read the reviews here on Amazon. I will not be buying PNY again. I suggesting sticking with better known (and more costly) brands."
1,lost all data,"Mine lost all data as well. Over half way through a 2 week trip of a lifetime in Italy, my card failed and I lost all pictures. Sent card to a data recovery company that tried to repair the card to no avail. Will never buy PNY again."
3,Lasted 3 years with no problems until...,"My PNY 256 MB CompactFlash Memory Card lasted for 3 years without a hiccup. It mysteriously died on me the other day and took a few pics with it. It lasted 3 years, so I assigned it 3 stars for quiet, dependable service. I would've wanted more reliability from a solid state device, hence the average rating."
5,Great Resources for Parents,I don't know of any other books in print with this kind of resource list included. Dr. Schneider has combed the bookstores for ideas to give to other parents. There are also some great suggestions for talking to children about G-d and answering the frustrating questions kids ask about Judaism. Well done!
4,Tokina 12-24mm,"Tried the lens at a wedding shoot last weekend at full 12mm. The images are excellent with edge to edge sharpness and contrast at f8. For half the price of a Nikon lens, it is 100% worth it!"
5,Majesty/Chariots Of Fire,"Seller responded immediately regarding question before purchasing. Excellent product, very prompt delivery. Would definitely buy from seller again."
5,Good Action-packed Beginning,"Well, like what you expected from most Star Wars comics, this one was another one which I recommend to other readers. The only flaw was it had a VERY exciting beginning but the finish was quite confusing and rather weak, but nevertheless, its a good book."
5,a very funny book,"they say to do comedy is hardest form of acting, so I must presume to write a book this funny must be the hardest form of writing. Congratulation on giving your readers something so original. I laughed at this book. Charming, funny...so delightful.Though I miss your medievals!"
1,Couldn't finish it...,"This was a book I just couldn't get in to. I had gotten almost half way through, when I put it down for good. Up to that point, I still hadn't gotten to know either of the main character's personalities. Also, neither had a sense of humor and there wasn't any lively, interesting, or meaningful dialogue between them.I had high hopes, since the situation sounded like so much fun. But, the situation alone can't hold this book up. It lacks two main characters with substance behind their good looks."
4,The Last ... Really?,"A tribe-raised orphan, anthropologist, and 29-year-old author on a book tour causes havoc with his slightly-older female escort by stripping down to native garb (OK, a G-string) during his lectures! The college students & public love it - He is gorgeous afterall - But she's supposed to keep him OUT of trouble! Yet, that's impossible when he announces on national TV that he's still a virgin, then later - rather bluntly - proposes to her! His antics are a riot and she may SAY she wants off the job but really, a picture (in his pocket) tells it all, and her heart must face facts. If you want serious mystery, with complex characters and a challenging plot... forget it. But if you just want a relaxing, no-brainer, romantic romp, then try this crazy story and enjoy some laughs along the way."
5,Wonderfully written and Extremely entertaining!,I was highly delighted by this outrageous tale. The author does a great job of drawing the reader into the story and making the main characters interesting and likable. Several twists in the plot makes it a book you won't want to put down. I also enjoyed the peek into Washington social life and found the details about Peter's native home very fun and interesting. It is obvious that the Author did her research well. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read and is able to sit back and enjoy a good laugh.
2,Low cost / moderate quality,"Purchased this to replace an aging faucet and didn't care to drop $100+ on a new one as I was unsure of my ability to install something like this. It served it's purpose for us (showed me that I can indeed install a faucet without too much hassle), but it also showed it's ""cheapness"" fairly quickly too. Even after working to clean the aerator, it left particles in the water and had issues ""sputtering"" on an almost daily basis. I replaced this unit within a year and learned that a more expensive faucet is well worth the investment."
4,Nice product,I really think this is a good product for the value. The only problem I had was I had to replace the sprayer after a months use.
2,Good Intro,"Winter's analysis of the Concerto is interesting, He demonstrates the various themes in fromt of a small audience. The performance is very good musically, but not visually. That is, you rarely see the pianists hands. Mostly you see his facial expressions. About the closest view you get of the keyboard is from the first balcony. Not a bad video if you can get it for a couple of bucks."
1,Useless,I bought them for work on my boat. They are useless you can't even drill a hole in aluminum... Sorry a returner...
1,leaves the beginner stranded,"i,m still trying to get grounded in blender,this book very often leaves me confused and helpless.Its like tryung to run through slow setting cement. That said what choice do i have but to carry on,the online tutorials are mostly for people who know what their doing,and slowly word by word i,m starting to feel like i,m getting there.It may be that the translators are completley usless at their job,whatever the reason for the terrible state of affairs ,it makes what i sense should be an easy learning curve into a crusade.Blender is a wonderful gift ,but you need moses to lead you to blendsville.Wonkyjoe , London."
2,Almost Terrible,"These other reviewers must be reading another book. It is vague, and it leaves many steps out of the tutorials."
5,Amazing juvenile voice,"This is the first solo album by this french-speaking singer from Quebec. Caroline was part of a group of young talents displayed on a TV show called Mixmania a few years ago. But on this solo effort her voice really shines through with a truly beautiful timbre and subtle tremolo especially considering she's still only 15!The choice of songs is really nice too, being a mix of folk and semi-hard rock with nice orchestrations and musicianship. Listen to ""Une page chaque jour"" to get a feel for the rock side or to ""Jusqu'au bout de mes reves"" for the folk-ballad aspect. Those two are my favorites on the album, but all tracks are worth listening to if only for this incredibly nice voice.Certainly one of the great talents to come out of Quebec this year. Strongly recommended, especially if you can appreciate the french lyrics."
1,deserves no stars,"This is the lamest FLASH GORDON ever. I am a huge flash gordon fan , but this series is less than a joke."
2,its ok,"I purchased this top, and the downsize is, make sure you buy a size larger. The orange color is a bit drab. the necklace is attached with lobster claws and can be removed. But the string in the middle part of the necklace is so flimsy, you will have to tack it better with a needle and thread. but the feel of the shirt is nice, thats why I give it 2 stars."
3,"Nice, but too big","I bought this top in a small size, but it is huge! (and I am not precisely a model eh?), by the way, there are no smaller sizes available so I had to give it to my pregnant sister!! The looking is nice ... on her!!"
2,quality of the book,"I am a lover of Gursky work, unfortunately the production of this book is very pour considering Size not only of the book but the images are to small leaving a lot of empty space. When you deal with photography sise is really important in order to be able to appreciate the images."
4,Beautiful pictures,"The pictures are jaw dropping. Exquisite. Incredible. Six stars pictures.. The most important thing to me is that his photography is SUCH that I turn pages very very slowly... Each picture contains majestic details... such a level of detail in each photo is what makes his photo craft so unique...However, there are too few pictures and many pages devoted to words and words... essays that ramble on art, pictures and blabla... I mean, I love words, i love books, but this, to me, misses the point of a book tha's mean for beautiful pictures...That's it..."
4,It's very good selection book for Gursky.,This book included some good photos of Gursky.Also having a detail explanation and script fro Gursky's work.
3,Nicely produced,"Gursky is a clever photographer who appears to be studying either the human condition or the nature of human irrelevance and anonymity - difficult to say. This book, wrtten in both English and German and emanating from an exhibition in Basel, goes only part way to examining his way of working, but spends more time on the influences on and philosophy of Gursky's work. As a photographer myself, I was disappointed that very little space was given to how Gursky actually constructs his amazing pieces. But maybe that's why it's art and not science?"
4,Andreas Gursky,"This is a fairly inexpensive way to acquire one of Andreas Gursky's books. Most of his other books are fairly expensive and seem to be increasing in value. The quality of the images is excellent and the only issue I have with the book is the size of the offerings. If you have ever seen one of Gursky's images in the flesh you will quickly realize that this book only hints at what his prints really look like. But an oversized book would have been more costly and even then would not have approached the scale that Gursky prefers. All in all, I would recommend purchasing this book which is something that I have obviously done."
4,Mind Boggling,"Its amazing how much more respect this book gets from guests once they realize the sheer size of these prints. The book is a great collection of his work, but cannot (of course!) truly do justice to his work.Gursky's eye for symmetry astonishes me...internal shots of hotels, landscapes of cities, even crowds.The book does a great job of borderless shots, to help exemplify his work as well as random close-ups to emphasize its clarity.You don't have to be a student of art to appreciate this book - rather you just have to be able to realize the grandness of gursky's work."
1,Reproductions don't do his work justice,"I haven't read the accompanying text yet, but if you've seen Gursky's work these reproductions don't do any justice to his work. I don't believe it's simply that the images can't be reproduced accurately, because an exhibition catalogue from a number of years ago was wonderful. I would skip this book if you're interested mostly in looking at the photos."
3,Good but doesn't teach skills,"This is a good program for reviewing skills that your child has already learned. My daughter can count and recognize #s 1-20 but does not know how to add or subtract yet. The program has ""adapted"" to the fact that she can do this but then she is stuck when it asks her what 5+2 is or 15-13. It doesn't seem to be able to ""adapt"" backwards again and does not teach her how to add or subtract. I guess it figures if it asks her the same question over and over again, she will eventually memorize the answer. I would love it if the program would show her how to add using visual cues. It can't be too hard to show 5 apples + 2 apples and let her count the total. My daughter has a lot more patience learning these skills on the computer then when I try to show her myself. True product of the technology age I guess!"
1,too old,Cannot review this item since it will not open on either the Mac or Windows 7. Software too old of a version.
3,My 4 yr old played this game,"This is an older game, but my daughter played it for a little while and then hasn't played it since. It's like a really old computer game."
3,"Nice program, just outdated","This program is great for my young children, but there are updated versions in the app store that cost much less and are much improved (graphics and gameplay). I recommend the product, just in the newer (and cheaper) version."
5,Great Program,"I love this program. My daughter is four and just started this program. Since its a progressive program, its a good challenge for her."
1,"Ancient software, not too great to begin with",We had issues from the time we tried to install. The copyright is 1999 and it insisted we didn't have sufficient memory (as if 2 Gs isn't good enough). There was an error message during installation and when I went to the website their solutions were incomplete and phone support for this product is no longer available.
5,Fantastic Album!!! - YOU MUST BUY IT!!,"I'm a Producer, and I have a K-set of this that Michele actually gave me herself when I met her at concert back in the 80's.This is absolutely the #1 BEST Contemporary Christian album EVER!! Michele is a brilliant song writer and an incredibly talented and creative performer! I don't just say this stuff - it's really true. I have no idea why she is not a household word. And she's a humble person to boot...The music is inspired and very timeless, even though some of the keyboard patches and drum sounds give it's era away - but I like that, and it's a positive for me.I actually took the time to rip the cassette to my iPod, and I listen to it often for inspiration. It's been a great source of encouragement, both spiritually and professionally!I would love to hear more new studio albums from her.Michele, if you're out there - keep kickin' out the jams!!!"
5,Great product!,This is a great product. i have more energy and truly feel as though I am able to think clearer!
1,Don't waste your money,cute car but you have to be SO close to it for it to even work. I talking a foot or two any further and it wont work.
2,Disappointed,You have to be right on top of the car for the remote to work. The batteries do not last long at all.
4,Fun first remote control car,"My kids really enjoy this car. My only two complaints are that we are constantly replacing the batteries (no more than an hour of play time), and you have to stay within a few feet of the car for it to work. Other than that - it's a lot of fun!!!"
1,Only Lasted for 20mins.....!!,"I got this toy car for my 18 month old daughter. It's much bigger and heavier than I expected, so that means you should be stocked up with fresh batteries..She doesn't know how to play yet. So basically I was holding the remote for her. I put four brand new dura cell batteries. It work for a while, then it stopped working... I thought the battery ran out, so I changed with brand new ones.. but no, IT'STOP WORKING... in less than an hour! wow.. waste of money...."
1,Watch out!,"Adorable car and remote, but no matter how many enegerizer batteries you put in them, they will not communicate with one another without moving 4feet from one another. Never have I rated a product till this one."
4,Lovely pink car,"My daughter loved this toy. At the age of 19 months, she is very keen to use the remote all by herself and play with her 'Pink car'. Ease to use and sturdy, this car is a good buy"
4,Cute Toddler Car,This is an adorable toddler car for little girls! My 4 year old granddaughter just loves it. Most remote cars are designed for boys and aren't feminine.This one is definetly that.
5,My daughters love it!,We purchased this car for my 4 year old daughter who wanted a remote control car. It got mixed review but I took a chance and we have had no problems with it. I also have a 7 year old daughter who loves it too and the buttons are so easy to use that our 19 month old daughter can make it go too. They love that they can put in a little princess toy in the car and drive her about. I love that the remote stores in the car. Great purchase!
1,what charger?,"I purchased this charger on 2/28 because I can't get one anywhere else. Unfortunately, I still don't have it! I just keep getting messages that it will be available in the next few weeks - then another message saying the same thing. Probably will have to cancel this order."
2,So-So,"I'm a HUGE fan of Star Wars games; most of the video games I own are Star Wars titles. Of all of the Star Wars games I've owned, this is one of the worst...of all of the video games I've owned, this game is so-so.For the DS, the graphics are decent. Some of the puzzles are pretty tricky, and the minigames are enjoyable. Overall, however, the FPS aspect is pretty weak, and the game doesn't take all that long to beat. The ""alliance"" aspect of the game adds to the overall experience a little bit, but this game really isn't worth the price.All in all, I was pretty disappointed with this game. If you're looking for a Star Wars game, there are better games out there (Lego Star Wars is great, and the Complete Saga is out now, I've heard EPIII for DS is good, and Force Unleashed is coming out next year). If you're looking for a good FPS, stay away from Lethal Alliance - it'll let you down."
3,"Much shooting, not much strategy","I love Star Wars games, but this isn't one of the greats. The mini puzzles using the droid are quickly annoying, plus she rides the droid at some points and it looks rather queer. The story begins well but loses momentum towards the end. Fun for a few hours but no reason to pick it up once it's finished."
4,good game,"The tutorial really helps, especially for a some-what rpg challenged girl like me. good game play, fun and entertaining"
3,mixed emotions on this one,"The first chapter really pulls you in...and the aspects of a ""love"" triangle is great, but as the story progresses the plot falls off. I was waiting for an explosive confrontation between the characters that never came.I adore Lnych's novels, especially Slot Machine and Extreme Elvin, and this one just didn't live up to my expectations. I hope you will try it yourself, perhaps you'll have a better time than I did...certainly don't pass up _Slot Machine_ or _Extreme Elvin_."
4,Whitechurch suggests much more than it says,"I enjoyed Lynch's ""Whitechurch"", but I felt a bit like a voyeur as I read it. The book focusses on the three main characters' desires and weaknesses, and the foreshadowing had me repelled and hypnotised simultaneously. The teenage characters seemed real to me: they are pitiful, yet somehow powerful at the same time. The characters in this book often do not do what we readers would like them to do, but doesn't that just sound like ""real life""? A good read with a realistic ending."
2,Seventies Sci-Fi,"The future we were presented back in the late Seventies and early Eighties looked like, well, rather like a decadent version of the suburbs. Lots of money, lots of technology to make us lazy and lots of overly relaxed morality. _Crystal Phoenix_ is the perfect example of that ""future"". In a world where anyone can clone themselves and have their memories stransfered to the new body, for a price, drug addiction and prostitution runs rampant. It's a violent vision of the future, to be sure, and almost a kind of morality play slightly disguised as a murder and revenge story. It's clever for what it was, but it's not the best example of science-fiction from that era.I picked it up as a kid from the paperback rack of a drugstore. At the time, I was quite titilated by all the sex and violence, but in retrospect, that was just a cover for a weak plot and a tired idea."
4,Great camera for the price,I work at a museum in central Wisconsin and use this camera to capture images of artwork and events in the Museum. I bought the Olympus SP-510 because of its features and low price and am pleased with the results that it produced. I used it just this morning and sent the images that I took to our designer to have title panels made for two exibitions that I am working on. The SP-510 is a bargin when compared with all of the features it offers.
1,lack of support for olympus Digital Camera,Have a S-2100 Ulta Zoom Digital Olmpus Camera had to upgrade from 2000 ME to Windows X/P and software supplyed by Olmpus does not work now must pay for new software. feel that olmpus does not support its equipment. Mel D
5,"Olympus camera makes me happy, but not fedex","I am at work all excited that at some point of the day my camera will be delivered home and I had a HUGE note on the door saying that if I am not there to knock the door on another apartment that ALWAYS someone is there.NOT!The fedex guy came and left a $220 digital camera at the doorstep!!!!I mean how retarded can you be to leave a package in the front door and not even see a message!!! So when I saw the comment online , I had to leave work and rally to go homeAmazon is great but it should be careful with which services they co-operate with.Can't wait to open and use the camera. Thanks Amazon!!!----Thanks Fedex...NOT!!!"
4,Great Camera,Easy to use and yet has some great advanced features.The picture resolution is fantastic and the colors are bright but balanced.
4,Olympus SP-410,"As advertised. With flash, takes cool pics in the dark. I like the scene selection mode when I'm in a hurry. I signed up for e-mail pointers from Olympus for this camera. Using the recommendations for special situations, you can't miss. I probably will never use all the features though."
1,Completely frustrated and disappointed with this camera,"We were never able to take a decent picture, the light was deemed on all the pictures. We called support several times and they could not help us to resolve the issue. Olympus support staff were rude and did not help us. We returned the camera. We have bought two Canon cameras. One works beautiful, the other one is brand new and will see. We will not try Olympus again."
4,510uz is great value,"This camera with a 2 gig card replaced both our old Olympus digital camera and our analog video camera. It gives us 30 plus minutes of video and pictures to boot. All functions are as promised. Con: so many features, it's hard to use them all."
4,Great camera - delay frustrating,"This camera takes suprisingly good quality pics. It is user friendly and the grip is nice. BUT the screen delay (delay of image appearing on screen) and shot delay (amount of time allowed between shots) is pretty frustrating. All in all, I like this camera and would recommend it to someone looking for a nice, affordable starter camera."
5,This devotional book is the best thus far!,"Hey teens who are sports fanatics out there! I am a 17 year old who loves sports of all kinds, and more importanly, I love my Jesus with my whole heart. I have grown so much closer to Him by reading Devotions From the World of Sports. John and Kathy are incredible writers which God has given the gift of writing to them. They make it so clear in this book how to live for God. Plus, you get to know some sports history on the side. I've had the pleasure of talking to John online, and he is an example to us all! Pick up his and his wife's book today, and I can gurrantee you will walk closer with your Savior! It is the highlight of my day. God bless you all out there. I love you all as a sister in our Lord God Almighty!"
1,"Absolutely the worst ""chocolate"" I have ever tasted",I enjoy tasting various gourmet chocolates from around the world. This product is apparently from Spain. This is a disgrace. Absolute awful texture (it seemed to get worse the more I chewed it) and extremely bland flavor. One bite and I was done. I am not going to ingest more calories on something so terrible.
1,i threw half the bar away,"And I mainly ate the first half cause the hazelnuts were pretty good. Hated seems harsh but I couldn't bring myself to eat the whole thing which is rare for chocolate :). I think the main problem is that they use ""chocolate liquor"" insted of cocoa which gives it a very bland taste and texture."
5,best for me,"I love these headset for my cellphone. I just slip it over my ear and put my cellphone in pocket. It makes it so easy to do dishes,iron, laundry and ect.I hate to hold a phone in my ear I like having my hands free. It was reasonable delivery time and the product it durable and well packaged."
1,Do Not Buy,"Do not buy this headset; it is sturdy-built and has decent sound, but the earpiece has an incredibly poor ergonomic fit that keeps shifting despite reaching a ""comfort zone"". I couldn't find a position where my headset would stay still and sit comfortably. This is unfortunately heading to Goodwill in the near future. Don't waste your dollars on this one. Keep looking for another headset."
1,Not what we expected from Thomas,Fast shipping. Great service from Amazon. The best price. But the toy was a real let down. Would not pick up the toy box with the magnet as was shown. Did not drop it in the rail car. Not something that I would tell someone to buy. This was not Amazon's fault. Amazon did more then I would expect.Thanks AmazonGeorge
5,Get Your Motor Runnin'...,"It doesn't get any better than this, the ultimate collection of ""car tunes"". Rhino Records even included car commercial themes, plus hard to find auto-themed tracks you probably haven't heard in eons. This 4CD collection is great for long road trips and driving cross country, just pop 'em in, buckle up and hit the road jack! Sure to be one of Rhino's most popular collections ever!"
5,FANTASTIC,"this is 1 of the coolest things I have bought in a long time..really great detail went into this..the book of facts, and the stickers are crazy..the music was just mint"
2,It's A Lemon,"Rhino blew it with this one. Great packaging, as usual for them, but the music is slight and it's not a good value. The disks average about 50 minutes each; if I'm shelling out 60 bucks for four CD's I expect them to be packed. They could have easily put this on 3 disks. But my biggest gripe is the song selection. Rhino used to be great about choosing the perfect theme mix tape collections--they did it with the doo-wop collection, Nuggets and many others. Here, there are maybe 5 or 10 songs I'd put on my personal ""Driving Tape"". A car album without any Springsteen? How about ""Drivin' Sister"" by Mott the Hoople? ""Cars"" by Gary Numan? ""Driving"" by the Kinks? ""Autobahn""? OK, I know they have to get the licensing agreements, but there are hundreds of car and road songs--many here are forgettable or just plain bad. I agree that the album doesn't flow well. However, I can't wait to put together my own driving tape."
3,Not a spray bottle : (,I like Vera Wang for Men. I was disappointed to receive this product though and find it was a *not* a spray bottle. Be forewarned.
