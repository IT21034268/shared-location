2,Hasn't helped so far,"Maybe I expected too much from this based on the other reviews, but this hasn't helped with my patellar tendinitis at all. Very disappointed."
3,First one I tried broke instantly,"The first time I tried it on it broke so I had to order a second one. Nevertheless, it is amazingly comfortable and functional, although I can see people with small leg circumference having trouble getting it to fit properly."
3,Review of kneebrace,"Is as it appears in all ad photos, seems to provide some knee cap (patella) improvement. EXCESSIVE mailing costs by this company is the worst part, far more than the purchase price to mail several ounces."
4,Good overall product.,"This brace is not for you if you have major knee issues, but if you had achy knees or minor, annoying pain it could help you! It helped me enough that I ordered a second one for the other knee and it has helped tremendously!"
4,Mysteriously Helpful!,"Who knows why this little band works so well, but it does. Have an arthritic knee and wore it hiking some difficult trails. Somehow this little product keeps everything in check. Glad to be an owner."
5,It works!,"Good quality product. I have a set of bad knees. I tried the Pro Band on my left and my regular strap on the right. The left feels better - painless. It's supporting my knee at the perfect place and it has definitely relieved me of much discomfort. I'm very active - play regular tennis. I cycle about 3-4 days a weeks and lift weights (includes squatting and lunges) about 5 days a week. I've tried many types of brace and knee support to mitigate the paid. This has been the best, so far. I've only had it a few days.... will monitor long term. I'll likely get another one for my right knee."
1,Poor design - broke in one week,"I purchased this for knee pain in my left knee on the left side of the patella. Unfortunately, due to the design, it tightens more on the right side of the patella than the left because that is where you cinch it down. I had to tighten it a little more for it to help on the left side of my patella, but it wasn't excessively tight. However, after one week of use, the small plastic piece holding the strap on the right side broke off. It is very thin and doesn't hold up to much pressure.This would be a great item if not for this doubly-bad design flaw. If you could cinch the straps on each side it would be possible to get good support on the left side of the patella as well as the right, and if it were shaped the same on both sides instead of the useless small plastic bridge the velcro loops around, it would hold up to a lot more use."
1,Poor design,"I have suffered on and off from knee pain when running for a few years now. It seems to act up most when training for marathons. I have tried a few different knee straps to treat the problem - ChoPat, Mueller, etc. This one is the worst. I liked the idea of the V-shaped rubberized brace that can help your knee track more accurately. The problem with this brace is that the strap has no elastic. It is single piece of velcro and has no stretch. Thus it is impossible to put it on correctly. You have to make it either too tight or too loose"
2,Harsh on the skin,"The knee-support function of this product is OK. However, the material from which the strap that goes behind your knee is so rigid and rough that it tears up my skin. I must wear it over my pants leg. I've given up wearing it for this reason."
2,Prp Band Knee Support,I did not find that this device to be very helpful. It would have helped ifclearer instructions had been give on using the device.
4,Bought for a Friend,"I already have one and since my knees are in terrible shape, help quite a bit. I really like the size, small and not a burden"
5,kneed-it knee band,"I had a total knee replacement 6 years and am very active in participation sports. The Kneed-it knee brace offers additional support for my ""new"" knee, both physical and psychologically. Very satisfied with the way Amazon.com handled the transaction."
2,Moderately Helpful,"May be helpful for tendonitis symptoms below the kneecap, but not so much for other knee injuries."
5,wonderful,"I have had kness probems since I hurt my knee in 2007. After the doctor operated he told me my knee was a really a mess and that he did the best he could but I would probably will need a knee replacement if the pain didn't settle down. I suffered since, using different braces,to no avail. My knee bothered me in the car so bad I needed to massage it all the way, also in bed my knee would ache. I saw the brace in a magazine and decided ti try it. I have had the brace for a month and wear it during the day and am able to walk without 90% of the pain and also my back pain has subsided. I can travel 3 hours in the car without pain, and no pain when I go to bed. This may not be the best brace for those who run or have sensitive skin but it sure has helped my pain."
5,Excellent product,"I jog on a regular basis and several years ago I started having knee pain due to an exercise badly executed. Some time ago I started training to run a marathon so I decided I needed a knee support. I got 3 or 4 products that didn't work for me until I bought this one. The difference was remarkable. I was able to run longer and longer and the support it giva me felt great. Finally, the big day came and I was able to run the 26.2 miles in about 4.5 hours. Not a great time but less than I thought it would take me and I'm convinced that I wouldn't even had made it to the finish line without the support of this product. Since then, every time I go running I have at least one of these on (for some reason, my left knee needs more support than my right knee). For me at least, this product really worked well and you may want to give it a try if you have knee problems and other products haven't work for you. Good luck!"
4,"Great support, some slide","I had minor knee surgery, and when I was able to start doing cardio again, this band helped me relieve some pain during running. It does what it is suppose to do, and helps with the compression of my knee pounding against the ground. The only issue I have with it, is when I start to sweat a lot, it feels like it has the tendency to slide down my leg and it moves a little from its original position."
4,Worked for me,"It may not be for everyone but it significantly stabilized my knee, more so than the Mueller and the ChoPat bands and was more comfortable than others."
3,True to it's title,"The book is reference book with various topics for all levels. Nothing is covered in a manner where it is difficult to understand. It's very straight forward and easy to understand. It's target audience is large so there is some material may not be useful to others. Like I said, it is indeed a cook book. A collection of recipes(tips, insights, knowledge) on various topics. I like the book but nothing really stands out to me strongly about it yet. I bought it mainly because I like the author's work on other things."
5,ATOMIC1701,WATCHED THIS IN THE 80'S AND LOVED THE MAGIC THE SHOW BROUGH TO ME BECAUSE I WAS GOING THROUGH A TOUGH TIME AND IT BROUGHT GREAT JOY
5,A truly great supplement,"This is a truly useful book. It describes Sorcerous societies and tells about the roll of Sorcerers in the World of Darkness. It now makes the distinctions between Sorcerers and Mages clear. One type of magic isn't necessarily more powerful than the other, yet the magic is learned differently: mages gain overarching understanding while Sorcerers gain their knowledge in a specific area a little bit a time. Best yet, the book can be used with any game just to give it a little extra flavor. Overall, if anyone is interested in Sorcery (or Linear Magic as the book calls it) or wants to add some extras to existing games, then this book is for you."
1,Waste of Money,"Simply put, it's a waste of money. A suppliment for using magic in a system that already has a system for using magic. Sorcerer might cut it as a lone game, but White Wolf didn't package it as a lone game."
4,Works well,We have seen a noticeable improvement with the dog. I think it is definitely worth a try. I also like that it is a natural product.
1,Doesn't work,Waste of money..does not work as described at all. My dog readily ate them but I noticed no difference in her incontinence.
2,Not happy.,"This product did not work, I was very unhappy.This product actually made my dogs problem much worse and I had to take her to the vet.The vet put her on good pill that helped her."
5,Just the right size trash can for my powder room!,"I love the size, color and the melamine material of this trash can. It fits my powder room and it's decor perfectly!"
5,the right color,"i usually don't buy certain colors over the internet to match my color decor for the house, but i seen this & the color match is perfect for my newly painted bathroom."
3,$19.99 for a narrow bathroom space,Neither the price nor the can are my first choice but the narrower size is what I need. This looks nicer and slightly darker in color than the photo so I like it more than I expected. It goes fine with my old blue toilet.
4,"Perfect, Small & Pretty","This is a sturdy, pretty, small trash can that works perfectly for a guest bathroom. It looks nice with the matching toilet bowl cleaner as a set."
2,Sloppy Craftsmanship,"Would look great if it lined up correctly. Goes together very crooked & doesn't line up 100% with other parts, & there are only three major parts. I ordered two holders, & both have the same problems. May redrill the screw holes to line things up better, but may just return both for a refund.I love the look, & it would be great if things were done correctly."
1,A better title is Bird Watching By Dummies,"This book is full of erroneous information that will lead the new twitcher astray, promote competition rather than cooperation between birders, and discourage some of the finest moments of birdwatching -- those involving sharing new sights and sounds together. I recommend that if you want to watch birds, buy a bird book, a pair of binoculars, and go look at birds. One does not need to spend money on a book to tell you to do that. There are many good bird guides available; my recommendation is the Audubon Society's Guide to the Birds of North America, or Lars Jonsson's Birds of Europe and North Africa. Best of luck, and keep your eyes and ears open!"
4,2mpg increase in mileage.,I got this for my 2006 Dodge Sprinter. It's expensive but worth it in my book. I'm up to 23mpg with a lot of weight in town driving. Also noticed a little more turbo sound which I like.
4,Comprehensive book,"The book contains a lot of information on the features of the COBOL language. Being a novice COBOL programmer, I found the book difficult to follow at times. It discussed in depth many features that are either obsolete or not implemented in the included compiler. Also, I would have liked to seen a discussion on how the compiler handles the SCREEN SECTION and trapping of function keys. However, the included compiler is great tool to use to learn the language and is worth the cost of the book alone."
5,Hilarious! Worth every penny! Go Hamaya!,"This manga is up there in my top 5 favorites. I was a little leery of the cross dressing girl in boy's clothes. It's been done again and again, but this manga is hilarious. The main characters Aizawa (girl) and Eniwa (boy) along with side-kick, comic relief Hamaya (boy) and it's roaring good fun! I busted out laughing so many times from their antics. Volume 7 is the best.Hamaya, my fav, is a love starved, sex crazed high schooler just looking for any girl who will have him. He doesn't find love until much later in the series in bonus stories.This series is 10 volumes long and worth every penny. I will enjoy reading it over and over! Enjoy!"
5,GET IT !!!!,"Top close-up photographie, multiplied by an infinite factor of 3D-fun for a very close and real look to bug's live! Both photographic disciplines are not easy to handle at their own. And here are more than 40 brilliant examples of each discipline are combined for a close look from an unknown perspective to insects, spiders and other small size creatures. I am not payed by the author or somebody else who earns money with this book, I am just absolute WOW!"
4,A book for all ages!,This is a fabulous book for insect and photography enthusiasts alike. The 3-D effect is so real it is like the bugs are sitting on your nose! My 14-year-old nephew likes the book and so do my adult friends. All of Blum's 3-D books are highly recommended.
5,Fine example of Macro Stereo Photography,"This is a wonderful book. Well designed, with fine viewer and sharp photos. A real bargain for the price. I'll need to collect the whole series. If you are familiar with stereo photography, this is a must have. If you think 3-D means added shadowing, this is a must have."
5,Child likes to follow along in book,"My 3-year-old loves to follow the songs in the book. I like the silly songs. We read a lot of Sandra Boynton when he was younger, so I'm glad she has a whole different series for slightly older children."
5,love the music,We have the other musical Boynton's and love them so when this came out I had to get it right away. I had to send the 1st one back because the cd didn't work. The second was better and we are enjoying it very much.
2,not what I expected,"I was expecting a book/CD for children. The music is too ""rock and roll"" for my child. She didn't want to listen to songs with words she couldn't distinguish."
3,Not as good as Philadelphia Chickens,"Purchased this because my kids love, as do I, listening to Philadelphia Chickens in the car but were looking for something new. Dog Train is OK but nowhere near as good as the PC."
5,Love It!,The music on this cd is great for both parents and kids! Great lyrics. Both my 3 year old and 1 year old sway to the music. My 3 year old picks the book for bedtime and we have to sing the songs to him. A hit in our house!
5,Fun for everyone,This is funny for kids and grown up's alike. Adults especially love seeing all the famous artists that are on the CD! I have given this as gifts to all my friends' and relative's kids.
4,Good Enough For Me,"Disclaimer: I'm a male middle-aged Sandra Boynton fan. All the books are in our library. Philadelphia Chickens is on my iPod (no, Pigorian Chant was STUPID and is NOT on my iPod - I'm not that much of a fanboy).Dog Train has also made it to my iPod. While I would say that none of the songs on Dog Train rise to the level of ""Cows"", ""Be Like a Duck"", ""Snoozers"", and ""BusyBusyBusy"", it does have some great songs nonetheless. ""Tantrum"" is very funny. Weird Al & Kate Winslet completely steal the album with my new favorite Boynton song ""I Need a Nap"". John Ondrasik (""Five For Fighting"") in ""Penguin Lament"" is great. The Bacon Brothers don't disappoint at all with ""Pots & Pans"".Is it as good as Philadelphia Chickens? No. Is it worth the $12.00 for the book and the CD? Of course it is."
2,Would not use in a music class.,This book is interesting and so is the music. But not one that could be used educationally in a classroom setting. It would be nice if the book had the complete lyrics to the songs. Some of the songs are quite boring.
4,Floor Liners,These floor liners fit in my F-150 about as good as they could get. A must have if you want to keep your floor looking nice. The design has a lip around it so water stays on the mat until removal. I would highly recommend to everyone looking for good floor mats that fit and don't move around on you.
1,Great Book - Bad Edition,"I have read ""The Soul-Winner"" on numerous occasions, so when I saw that it was available on the Kindle I was more than happy. However, that soon changed when I opened this edition and found that the table of contents wasn't linked, and there were many typo's in the book. For instance instead of ""W"" one would see ""Vv"" some words could be deciphered others went untranslated. Very disappointed."
1,Doesn't work at all,"I received this a/c, installed it according to all the directions step by step and waited for the moment of cold air when I turned it on. And waited. And waited. And waited. The book said the a/c would run for 3 minutes before cold air blew in, but after 15 minutes all the thing did was hum. Then it stopped and nothing. I am returning this for a full refund; I found a window unit locally that cost less and is energy star rated. Works better, too. Circut city, $135."
4,Good and Bad,"Nice features, relatively compact, does the job. Delivery was horrible; the package was smashed up beyond belief. Good price/convenience of door delivery. Frigidaire mailings are somewhat annoying, spammy."
3,Loud and Lets in Daylight,"The unit is loud with fan on even at low setting and it does not improve when on a/c. Also no one has mentioned the fact that it lets in a huge amount of daylight which is a pain when you have it in a bedroom. No other a/c we have used lets in light like this, what a design fault. I have had to put a mat on top of the outside and even this does not stop the light getting thru."
2,thanks Fred,"I just brought back an 8,000 BTU version because it was so loud I couldn't sleep. The sales person thought I was crazy. I will look at the 6,0000 version. It seems like a nice AC."
1,Very unhappy customer,"Would give it less than one star if I could - for product as well as for Amazon service and UPS delivery.Purchased this item for my in-laws that live out in the country/outside of a small town with few options for appliance delivery. Paid for one-day delivery; UPS dumped item at the gate (after 6 pm!) rather than driving item 100 yards up the drive to the front door (as noted on delivery tracker). We were thus unable to install the expected day. Two weeks later were able to return to attempt install. Partially cool air obtained. Had to leave MIL to deal with trouble-shooting by phone with Frigidaire. Product got moved to an upstairs window with more clearance - no cool air produced. Now passed 30 day return window. Amazon completely unhelpful. Recommend NOT purchasing appliances here, especially not this a/c."
2,Too much water,"Turn new unit after it rained, started making a terrible sound, went outside to check unit and got a face full water. The unit does not have any drain holes in drain pan. The fan blades rotate into the water throwing it everywhere and makes alot of noise. Called Frigidare support line and all I got was a bunch of recordings. Tried to find info on their web page but had no luck. No customer support at all. I think I will take it back and get a different brand."
4,problem with accordian side panels,"I've been pleased with the cooling and the various options. However, the accordian side panels don't snap into place but needed to be taped to stay shut (to ensure I don't cool the outdoors, let hot air in the house..or bugs, etc.). Only after I carefully taped the sides, did I then realize that due to the vibrations, my taping job wasn't strong enough. So I used more tape, taping the side panels to the window frame instead of just to the air conditioner. The cats then proceeded to try to rip it off. Finally, I covered the side panels with cardboard using lots of tape in all areas. Since I went to all this extra trouble I realized too late I should have gone ahead and used some insulation between the panels and the cardboard."
3,"its ok,,BUT","With this A.C., you get your money worth of cool air. Easy to install, but I have never seen it lose a drop of water, UNTILL I took the A.C. out the window!!! Water fell inside my house!!! it is light for one reason, so you can maneuver the A.C. whil hanging it out the window to drain the water out!!! It can be tricky, they need to put some drain holes. Also the only drain hole in this A.C. lines up right smack in the middle of the window sill, so if it ever does drip, it may come towards the house"
3,"Decent efficient AC, but very loud without modifications","I bought one of these to replace an oversized 8000 btu/hr window unit that was almost a decade old.What worked:1. Much lighter and easier to install than most window ACs I've used.2. Good cooling for the energy used.What didn't:1. This is not a quiet unit by any stretch.2. As the other reviewers have mentioned, there's no drainage to the drip pan. This would probably be okay, but in mine the fan is mounted such that the tips of the fan can actually make contact with the water if the drip pan is full (and the unit is installed properly and level). This results in a constant ""sloshing"" sound when run on high humidity days. As a result, I ended up (carefully, you don't want to hit the coils!) drilling a small drainhole in the drip pan, carefully coating the hole edge with silicone to keep the exposed metal from rusting. The unit now runs with just fan noise."
2,Noisy!,"Great price! The first week the unit was fairly quiet but then started getting louder. Strange clanks and grunts are appearing. The temperature gauge will show only the ""Set"" temp. and not the room temp when in the cool mode.Mike T"
1,Saves electricity by not working,"At first I was disappointed that this unit didn't work - right out of the box - but then I quickly saw an upside in that it wouldn't be eating up electricity. I could be saving $50 or so, I imagine, by sitting in a sweltering room with a non-functioning air conditioner that can't be serviced, according to Frigidaire.If I really bite the bullet and opt for a working air conditioner I can look forward succumbing to heat exhaustion while boxing this baby up and sending it back to the retailer at my expense."
1,mine didn't cool at all,"Mine didn't cool at all. I bought it in January. Had it installed in the hole in the wall. Then summer came. And the air it blew was not cool. You don't want to have to call Frigidaire. Don't ask. Eventually they'll maybe send me a refund check. But they said those units are unserviceable, so it doesn't look like I'm going to get a guy to come out and fix it. That means I have to have a guy come out and uninstall the old one and install the new one I'm going to have to go out and buy during a heat wave. Anyway, I hope I can find one that isn't a Frigidaire because its been a big hassle and now a big expense with no promise of any refund."
4,Provides good cooling,Bought two of these. Some people say that they're too loud but I disagree. Noise is reasonable and the units do a good job cooling.
2,"Not Draining, Water Smell,Noise",The unit manages to cool quite a large room and with little noise. It blows cold air properly but even after I repositioned it five or six times I cannot get it to drain properly and it smells bad (stale-like) and I hear the water gurgling inside.
4,Nice little A/C,"Very quiet, cools the room well, light weight. Air vents not very adjustable but seemingly not a real problem. We ordered 2, both arrived damaged, one was acceptable, but the other destroyed. Amazon was very quick and pleasant with both shipping a new one immediately and providing for a free return. Just be aware there might be a problem here. I would recommend this unit."
4,Cool,"The A/c's are a great buy and a jewel for their abiliy to cool. The only problem was with the installation due to a bent expansion guide that was damaged in shipping. Other wise, all is ""Cool"""
3,"Lasted Only 1 Season. Now Blows Room-Temp Air, Like Fan","Worked well at first. Did it's job, at least. Got the room cold...but it's only a bit larger than a king size bed. Well worth $150, but should work for longer than just one season. Mine came with a remote, guessing this does too. Plan on buying different brand, if I can find one. I'm pretty sure I got the frigidaire at Walmart, so they're probably all the same. This is my first review less than 5 stars. Usually I'm pretty happy with stuff... gb"
1,Worked for 1 month,"Mediocre performance for 1 month after purchase, then coils failed. Other buyers may be happy but I'm not impressed."
4,whitesnake rocks london!!,"Ok fans of melodic hard rock get ready to rock and enjoy yourselves, because this dvd is worth every cent! It opens with this wavy guitar, and goes into the deep purple song burn, which the band does really well. This show the band does the songs you want to hear like Badboys, cryin in the rain, judgement day, and still of the night. Now a little bit about the band. Coverdale really picked up some great players. He got Reb Beach from Winger and Dokken, and my favorite Doug Aldrich. This guy is a seasoned player from bands like Lion, Hurricane, and Burning Rain. In my opinion a very unrated player. And Tommy Aldridge is as potent as ever on the drums. Performance wise, the crowd was with them all the way. David is still doing his microphone tricks to perfection. There was a few songs I didn't think belonged here, but what the heck, it's a dvd skip em! If you are a whitesnake fan this is a must own! Pick it up asap!"
2,DVD gives me a headache,"Being a big Deep Purple fan, I had high expectations for this Whitesnake DVD. I read all the reviews here and thought, man this has got to be one great concert.Well, who filmed this abortion? The DVD gives me a headache with the 13 cameras jumping all over the place. Another MTV style concert (I hate them). The film and audio quality is technically excellent, but the end result is an awful concert to watch. By the time you get focused on some action the film director hits the clicker button again and again. The rapid camera change is relentless. I shut the dang thing off half-way through and put in one of my Purple DVD's. I'm disappointed and done with Whitesnake. Another $15 down the drain."
5,woow,"coverdale and all the others... thank you so much... you took me back to 23 years ago when I was a student in the university... there were no compact disc those days... i used listen you guys my cassette player over and over and over.... the best concert song ""ain`t no love in the heart of the city""...."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"This is NOT David Coverdale singing live... Simply, this is the poorest job I've ever seen done of blatantly redubbing the vocals in a studio and editing the concert footage so surgically precise, that you never really see David singing for too long, it's that apparent. Tommy has ALWAYS been a rock solid animal on the drums and Reb is a great guitarist, it's a shame to see him playing rythm in the background. The lead guitarist has skills, no doubt. I've heard bootlegs of David singing 10 years ago and his voice is not this good live...NUFF SAID"
4,Turn up the volume!,"As so many have said these guys are masters at their instruments, and David is a great front man. That being said the sound recording could have been better especially concernig the lead guitar solos. They are not loud enough and that goes for the keyboard solos too!!!My God what did they do to Dave's face? He looks like a cross between Cro-Magnon man and the living dead. Still it's a great performance and worth buying (just for Burn/Stormbringer alone)."
2,Ain&#65533;t no magic in the heart of Whitesnake,"Overall this is a fine concert DVD. Been a Coverdale and Whitesnake fan for so long. David?s voice is still powerfull. Yet, there are so many great old songs that the recent ones does not have nothing to do compared to the others. This band used to have a lot of deep soul playing with people like Bernie Marsden, Mickey Moody, Neil Murray and the late Cozy Powell. Sadly I kind of sensed that the magic is gone, I didn?t like the performance of ""Don?t break my heart again"", ""Ain?t no love in the heart of the city"" was good not musically, basically for the voice of Coverdale. Hearing the rest of the songs didn?t thrill me at all. It is sad that David is against the idea of getting back with his old workmates who have tried to work with him again. Personal perception."
3,DECEPTION,THERE IS A BIG PROBLEME WITH THIS DVD THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD EVERYTHING IS SO GOOD BUT THE IMAGES GOES IN BLACK AND WHITE EVERYTIME SO IT IS IN COLOUR AND THEN IN BLACK AND WHITE ALL ALONG THE CONCERT IT IS VERY ANNOYING I CAN TELL YOU THEY MADE THE SAME WITH THE LASERDISC OF IRON MAIDEN LIVE AT DONNINGTONIT IS A BIG PROBLEME AND THAT GET ON MY NERVESO
3,Doug who...,In any case you want the true feel of the whitesnake that actually hit hard check out the badboy cd by the guitarist that put whitesnake on the map JOHN SYKES ...then check back on the wannabes til then don't try to elabborate with your knowlege of the more abstract artist just go for the original and squash it. laterz!
5,Best Whitesnake Concert I've seen since 86!!!,"If you purchased the DVD/CD combo, you'll most likely be disappointed with the CD, reason being not all of the tracks are on there, however, the DVD rocks!!! You get to see Doug Aldrich (Dio) and Reb Beach (Winger, Dokken) rip it up on Ready and Willin'!! And of course, David ""D***slingin' Coverdale can still give you a rockin' show. The only problem I had with the show was they didn't perform ""Slide It In"" and ""Slow And Easy"", but you can order their double CD""Live... In the Shadow of the Blues"". Overall, I highly recommend this DVD for all hardcore fans of Whitesnake!!!"
2,This isn't live,"I really liked this DVD when I first got it, but on repeated viewing, I discovered that it is a live show.....video, but for audio it has overdubs for vocals & guitar. I'm not sure about bass & drums & r. guitar, but the rest has been enhanced. It's enjoyable as a ""MTV"" like performance, but not a truely live performance, meaning the audio is really good, but not an honest show from the band. I really enjoyed the 1st few Whitesnake CD's."
4,Not only for fans!,"Not only for Whitesnake fans. It's for those who like the best on stage, and for those who wanna see the best heavy rock and roll singer - ""Mr. Coverdale"" alias ""David Coverdale""."
5,Whitesnake RULES !!,"As the Family Guy's Peter Griffin would say, ""Freakin' Sweet!"" this DVD was incredible from start to finish. I was able to see Whitesnake in person three times back in the day and this show ranks as good, if not better, than those. To be honest, I really had no idea who David Aldrich was,but to see him take away most af the guitar solos from Reb Beech,I was thoroughly impressed. Coverdale's voice was on all night. I am a drummer and have been for twenty-something years. Tommy Aldridge has always been one of my favorite drummers as well as a HUGE infuence. The man is simpley amazing. To be playing at such an intense level at his age is just amazing.Well I hope everyone enjoys the DVD half as much as I did. If so, you WILL NOT be dissappointed in your purchase."
4,When Christmas comes again,"Simones brother william was of to war to be a doughboy which is an american soilder. Simone is in the twelth grade she starts writing in her jurnal April,6, 1917.

3,Very small 10GA wiring,As long as you understand the size and power rating for 10GA wiring this kit is great. Dont expect to push 1000wts through this cable
1,There are much better kits out there....,"Tried this for a single small amplifier install. According to my wiring tools, this is not 10 gauge power wire, more like 12 gauge, the included connectors are also thin and rather cheap. Did not use the included RCA cables. There are better kits out there, avoid this one."
3,Heh,"Not that great, it included everything you will need for a little set up. Do not get this kit if you're planning to expand your system. Oh and it doesn't include speaker wire. I've bought other kits here in Amazon that do include good quality speakers wire. It's Boss, don't expect too much. The fuse is a joke.This set wouldn't work for anybody looking to install mono amp for sub woofers, maybe a little 400 watt amp for components."
1,"Not 10 gauge, more like 14-16 gauge","I am a electrician by trade. i know wire sizes. this is Not 10 gauge, more like 14-16 gauge. it comes with yellow 10 awg connectors, however the connectors are way to big to crimp onto this wire. i had used blue wire connectors witch are used for 14-16 wire. i might have been able to get a red crimp to fit. but i didn't try. a lot of the cheap wire kits are not the size stated. you get what you pay for."
2,its okay...,"The gauge isnt true... the rca cable is cheap and broke after 2 weeks but it works okay, powers my 1000 watt pyramid amp pretty good, you get what you pay for."
4,TyWin,"For $8 its a good a deal, but it's one gauge down for everything, 12 power and ground 20 radio and remote. I wanted it to hook up subs a box so it's great for me."
4,"Good kit, short ground cable.",Overall I was pretty happy with the kit. The instructions were clear and easy to follow and the supplies seemed of good quality. The only thing I wish is that the ground gable was another foot in length. 2 feet just doesn't cut it.
4,Good for smaller jobs,Yes it's true the gauge of the wire is not accurate. Its a little smaller. DO NOT BUY THIS if you're trying to hook up a high watt amp and a bunch of subs. Go bigger and more expensive. I used this for my 350 watt amp and 10in Kicker sub and it does the job fairly well. Everything sounds great and I haven't had any problems... yet. :)
5,It was everything I needed,Everything I needed was there and more. I was very pleased with the price and the product I received.
1,Broken,"This is not 10 gauge, more like 14. Also the power line was broken when I received it. Spend the money on a better product"
3,Exclusively for leaders,"The book contains some good activities, but the fact that they are ONLY for use with those in leadership positions was not reflected in the title. If you're looking for EQ activities for leadership development, this would be a useful book. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,Disappointed Students,Bought this so my students could work the exercises but they were bored with them.
2,Not useful at home,These activities are clearly for use at work when you are the boss. Not useful anywhere else.
3,Woe to inaccurate translation,"Biedma is a genious in that he captures a very real, non-traditional side of Spanish life. The truth in his poems is captivating and somewhat addictive. However, as a bi-lingual speaker, I found Nolan's translation to be inacurate and therefor I was forced to give this book only 3 stars. If it had been a Spanish-only version or had been translated properly I would have given it 5."
5,"Strange, Beautiful, Mysterious, Moody but very likeable","Lots of moods and atmospheres here. I guess you can call this a variation of modern jazz, depending on your musical background. To me it is a modern Jazz-Rock-Ambient fusion album. Extremely free form, not a theme anywhere but it works for me. I think the mood of this album is what makes it happen. The performances are great by all. I find I enjoy this cd best at night through a pair of good headphones. It does take a while to grow on you. The drumming on this album is very interesting, it just kind of floats above the rest of the band. You could also file this under New Age, but not the syrupy bland kind. This is one of my new favorite albums at the moment. It is so hard to find interesting music these days, amazing the kind of music that came out once upon a time time."
4,good selection from the ECM library,"back in the 1970's I had a lot of these ECM label jazz records, they were a bit on the eclectic side, but they sounded good. This one is pretty representative of the label's output, a lot of ""mood music"", but jazzy. Doesn't really jump up and grab ahold of you , rather it is more kind of music for the background. ECM recorded a lot of great jazz musicians, mostly from Europe (where the label was from as well), even though this album features the great Jack Dejohnette on drums, playing very understated but steady drums throughout."
2,terje spoils his own album,"If you have no qualms with hearing synthesized, overly cocked-out distorted guitar sound completely out of place over two of the best musicians to ever play, you'll like this. Jack and Miroslav play excellently (as usual), but I can't get past terje's sound. I don't mind the comping so much, but his solos make me want to vomit on my shoes- they're tasteless. Listen to this before you buy it or you might find that terje just sounds like a rocker in the wrong setting. The disc is only atmospheric until he switches his amp up to 11. Props to Jack and Miroslav for playing their asses off. Terje gets 0 stars."
1,Disappointment,"The thing that I don't like it the more about thisbook is why it no give better example? I read thisbook very careful, but when I took TOEFL it was notsame. The book was easy that the TOEFL. I think thisbook is not for real study."
4,Very good for grammer review,"Hey friends, this is for test preparation, not for English language learning; otherwise, it will call ""English"" not ""TOEFL"".Its grammer review sections are very good. It absolutely worth a buy."
3,Not As Funny As The Original,"The FIRST Guy Noir release was more faithful to the original conceit of Noir - as a hard-boiled detective talking tough with his clients, his friends and his women.Here, you get something else: Guy's much more self-conscious. While interacting with PHC guest stars would normally promise some greater variety, it is honestly not too forthcoming. He has become fussy and self-absorbed, and a lot of the great tough talk present in earlier episodes is missing here.It's a good listen - and I love PHC, too. It's just not as good as the very first release..."
4,Great little guitar,"I'm one of those guys who plays so little, my fingers never get tough enough to play very long. This guitar is just what I needed. The nylon strings make it easy on my fingers, and the 3/4 size makes the neck about the same size as a regular steel string. The result is an easy to play guitar that the ""once in a while"" player can pickup and play for hours. Great guitar for knocking around the house for a small investment."
4,Fun to read,"Being an avid reader of German WWII books, I was told to read this book just for fun, and that is exactly what it is.It is pure fiction, but after reading so many serious books about German equipment this was a nice change of pace.The book is corny, and you will never look at the Jagdpanther the same way again. Like I was told, ""its stupid, but entertaining"""
1,Dont waste your money !!!!,"I give this item very poor rating. The fit was terrible, the absorbancy was next to nothing. I would have been better off wearing a flour sack with a garbage bag.Adult Reusable Cotton/Poly Snap Diapers - Large - Fits 32"" - 46"" - Each"
4,Good pump for the money,"I used this pump for both of my children, a total of about 12 months of use. It helped up fantastic for the first 6-7 months, then I started having problems. I noticed that if the plastic liner/diaphragm between the hose and the cup got wet (for instance if it had a few droplets left on it from washing) it would get very easily stuck to the side wall and I would lose suction. The machine would get stuck in an ""on"" cycle and pump very hard until I removed my breast and dried the diaphragm. I also had one instance where it went into a very different suction cycle, sucked milk up above the cone where your breast goes, and actually the milk went through the hose. This obviously is not supposed to happen, because the hose leads directly into the mechanics of the machine and could damage the pump. Overall, it worked fantastic for the first six months before the problems started."
1,Very disappointed,"I'm a first-time mom who started pumping at week 3, for just one 4-5 oz bottle per day; I have since increased pumping sessions in anticipation of returning to work part-time. I initially chose the Ameda over the Medela Pump In Style because I'm not pumping full time, and the Ameda had been recommended based upon its function, its hygiene set-up, and its price. Unfortunately, after only 5 weeks of use it has already lost suction - low marks for reliability, even for someone with limited pumping needs."
3,Cheaply made but easy to use,"I was disgusted at how cheaply made this unit is. The stethoscope parts are made of easily bendable psuedo-metal, the cuff is plastic and very lightweight. I was also surprised that ""some assembly is required"", which I did not anticipate.That said, I was also surprised at how well I could hear the pulse beat through the Mickey Mouse stethoscope and the reading was very accurate. It is also much easier to put on your own arm because of the metal D ring attached. It also comes with a decent carrying case.I don't know why anyone wouldn't go with a digital automatic monitor these days, other than maybe cost. I'm a nursing student and wanted to see the difference in ease and sound quality between using the standard 2 equipment protocol (stethoscope and bp cuff) and this with the built in stethoscope. I was pleasantly surprised and will keep this cheap little unit in my car first aid kit. Not sure how long it will last, but it is low priced and easy to use."
3,"Good, but not Great","This blood pressure monitor is pretty good for the money. First, before you buy ,know that the stethoscope is actually sewn in and cannot be removed. The actually item is not bad. It is pretty accurate if you do it a few times. It is very loud (nylon) and difficult to put on yourself, so i would recommend a friend to assist you. this item is worth the 14 dollars, but nothing more. Its not spectacular and does what it is supposed to, nothing more. I would not recommend this for frequent use, as the material seems cheap. Buy this if you are low on money and would like to measure your BP every once in a while."
3,Not very happy with it,"If you need a blood pressure cuff and don't have much money to spend, then this one may meet your needs. However, I don't like mine, and bought an electronic one that I greatly prefer.Pros: Inexpensive. No batteries. Fairly accurate (if you can hear it).Cons: Uncomfortable cuff and ear pieces. Awkward to put cuff on by yourself, as it has no ""structure"" of it's own to help hold it in place and has the other parts dangling from it. Difficult to hear pulse unless you are in a VERY quiet room (plus the velcro on the cuff tends to make a lot of noise too). It smells. I know that sounds weird and petty, but it has a very strong chemical odor that is unpleasant and is noticeable from a distance.I give it three stars because it does the job and may work fine for some people, but my personal satisfaction with it is less than that."
5,high quality,"I had tried the electronic kind of BP monitor and found them unreliable.I have taken my own blood pressure for many years. I've learned much from doing it. I had a manual unit from a local drug store, 8 years old but very accurate. Still it is wearing out.This Life Source unit is of better quality (construction, etc.) than my drug store model. I cross check with my old unit and of course doctor visits. This unit is very accurate.It takes just a little practice to learn to do this yourself"
5,Quality BP Cuff,We had been using an old cuff and did not realize just how much they had improved. This product is great!
3,Have used better,"Honestly speaking, i have seen much better kits in the past. The look and feel is that of a toy but guess what, shows blood pressure!"
5,LifeSource blood pressure kit,Very pleased this kit comes with soft ear tips and a calibrator to calibrage when a bit off target. All others I've used came with hard plastic white tips painful. Cost wise good pharmacies charge $10. more.
1,Poor quality tubing doesn't last,"I was originally happy with this item, in spite of the cuff material being rather loud, but after a year and a half the tubing to the bulb and dial have both become brittle, cracked, and won't hold pressure, leaving it useless. I noticed the needle on the dial going down slowly before opening the release knob several times before realizing the tube was compromised. This should make one dubious about accuracy over the short lifetime of the device. I can't recommend purchasing this at all."
4,easy to use home blood pressure monitor at affordable price,"This is very simple to use and made a little better than the cheap one I owned prior which was purchased at Walgreens. The earpieces are a bit hard and brittle, but you are not going to have them in your ears long enough to cause pain! Readings are predictably accurate and it comes with a calibrating device in the event that you need this. Much preferred to the digital models that often do not give reliable and consistent readings. Recommend."
5,Excellent BP monitor,This is a great monitor. Easy to use and very accurate. Would recommend product to all. Very quick service and well packed for shipping.
4,Battery Free Monitor,I was looking for a battery-free monitor with an actual gauge instead of a digital display. This one works great and meets my requirements. All monitors give you numbers but I believe that this unit is consistently more accurate because of the gauge. Results with this unit track readings from the doctor's office.
5,Excellent choice,"For a ""single person"" unit with attached stethoscope, this item is recommended. The components are well made and the valve on the bulb is easily controllable. It comes with instructions and warranty, from what appears to be a reputable company."
5,Life Saver,A must have for any medical professional. Its inexpensive and effective. Nothing like checking a BP yourself which is more accurate than the automatic electronic cuff. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product to any and everyone.
3,OK product,"The product is OK. It does what it supposed to do.When you are listenig to the tones, find where ths count begins and where it ends requires a ""judment call"". Even 2 trained professionals sometimes have readings deffer each other by 15 or more points. For a few dollars more one can buy the same manualy pampped device, but with electronic block to read the results."
1,Wrong item description,"When I ordered my cologne I believe that it was going to be a new item in a box. When I opened the package that it was sent in It was not in a box it was in a Ziploc bag. I also was surprised to find out that the Cologne was a tester bottle. Nowhere in the items description did it say that it would be a tester bottle. The cologne was also supposed to come with a metal lid bit it was made of plastic. I was very dissatisfied That I received a tester And not a new inbox bottle that I was expecting. For the price I paid I was very surprised at the condition of the bottle of cologne.So if you are considering buying this item, just know that it is a tester bottle with a plastic cap."
3,Not as fun as the rest,"I was elated when I discovered this book, I grew p on Fudge Hatcher and his antics. But this book was strange, Fudge wasn't nearly as wild as he had been previously. I dont think this was a bad book, but it could have been better."
3,Gideon's Book Review,this book is about fudge that just turned 5 years old and he is learning how to use money the problem that is his mom told him to don't ask nice good people about there money so peter has to teach him and allasounden fudge get's obsessd with money so pete has to stop him from doing the bad stuff bfore his mom knows about it.pages up to 10.
3,Great book- terrible binding,"Of course this book is great to read, but choose a different edition! I have this edition and the binding in the spine cracked in half almost immediately. It is simply and big glob of glue holding the thing together and will not stand up to much love!"
1,Parents be warned,"I appreciate another reviewer's warning about the book, so I checked it myself. At the very end a childhood belief is spoiled.The book may be very clever otherwise, but I'll keep it away from my kids. I want the magic to last as long as I can. Why did Judy Blume have to do that?"
2,Peter,I thought the book was okay. I didn't like all the parts. Some parts were funny and some were really boring. Fudge is an okay character but he is not really that funny. The funniest character I thought was Peter. Peter says funny stuff sometimes mostly when he is telling Fudge something. Fudge doesn't know a lot of things like about money. He thinks money grows on trees. Fudge is very funny sometimes but not all the times. Fudge says weird things sometimes.For the most part the book was Ok.
1,What on EARTH????,"As an avid Judy Blume reader, I grew up in the early 90s reading Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing, Fudge-A-Mania and SuperFudge. And I am 20 now and I was so excited to hear that their would be a new Fudge book. But this book was not what I was expecting. It mentions cell phones, the internet, and Harry Potter, while in the first three books they were talking about record players and were pictured in bell bottoms!!!!! Now, how can someone teleport in from the 70s to the 2000s in what appears to be only a one or two year age increase????? It makes this book so unrealistic it isn't even funny."
3,Double Fudge,"I think you might want to read this book because the book keeps you guessing what will happen next.It's a good book beacuse it's full of suspense. Also, the book is full of humor. I think if you read this book you will enjoy it.I learned that even if you fight with your siblings or family members ,you still love each other. If you don't like your cousins, you have to find ways to get along because they will always be part of your family."
5,kids rock,"It was funny, interesting, and it was written well. I read all of the Fudge books and they all were great. My favorite character was Peter. I liked Peter because I also have a little brother that is annoying."
4,Double Fudge,"This book is a good book because this boy like,s money so much he like,s to draw ,and dream about money he is even cray about money.And his name is Fudge he also has a cusien that look,s just like him. And Fudge has a sister and his sister has a friend and his name is Jimmy. And Jimmy is moving and one day Fudge and his sister were on the subway and Fudge lost his shoe that is why ilike this book."
5,it is a great book,"I bought this book for my daughter.She reads out loud and I was listening all the time .I loved the book right away.I started to read the book in bed before I go to sleep.My friends think that I am being silly,but I do not care.I love the book and the fact that you find yourself in the pages,both as parent and as a kid back then.A great book for kids and adults too.Thank you JUDY BLUME."
4,Arjet Suka's Review,I liked the book. It was a little funny. What I liked about the book is that Fudge was interested in money. He also wanted a panda as a pet. What I also liked abot this book is when Howie and his family saw Warren and his family. Then they lived more than one week together.
4,...Review,"I think I like reading this book ok like a B-. I think reading this book is for a little kid, maybe 9 years old. But I still like this book because Its fun. This book title is Fudge but this book is not all about fudge I thought this book would be all abuot Fudge but it is not. ..."
4,Double Fudge!,"I think this book this book is fun and Intersting to read because Its funny when you read beging chapter and its Interesting because in a sudden shock they bump into their long lost cousin, cousin Howie. I also think this book is kinda a good example for little kids that they wont start making fake mooney and try to use it, and another good example is that it theaches kids to NOT be obessed with money"
3,A nice ending,I hope the series would continue because once you start reading you won't stop. Take it from me l'm eleven and I've read the entire series.
1,Awesome book,I love this book it is soooooooooooo awesome i read it all the time i cant take my eyes of it
4,two Fudges in one apartment,"The Hatcher family goes to Washington for a familly vacation, and they meet up with their cousins from Honolulu Hawaii, Howie, Eudora, Flora, Fauna, and Mini Fudge. Fudge and his cousin have the same name. Peter's cousins stay in their little apartment for about 3 weeks. Peter has to put up with Fudge, Mini Fudge, the twins, for 3 weeks. I liked this book because it was very funny and it had a lot of action. It was funny because there was always trouble and it was always wild in their apartment. The house is always a mess. The kids play kickball inside. Mini Fudge even let the birds out of their cages. I have never heard anything like it.Iwould recommend this book to kids who like funny books, or -- kids who don't like to read for a real long time for something good to happen. It will always make you laugh."
4,Fudge is crazy for money,"Have you ever met somebody who is obsessed with money? Well if you read this book you'll jump into a world of money and a whole lot of trouble! Double Fudge is about a small five year old boy, his older brother pete and some very annoying relatives. Fudge is a small boy who is totally obsessed with money. He and his brother don't always get along. To kill fudges obsession their grandma suggested a trip to where they made the green stuff/money. The family met up with their long lost cousins, the Heavenly Hatchers. From then on, Pete thought his life would never be the same. See how Pete survives his new life and if Fudge ever gets over his obsession. If I had to rate this book, it would be a four out of five, because it was funny and well written."
2,Get Something Else!,"As this DT-604 ships from Amazon it does not come with the necessary, or promised, tips for the probe. And LifeSource just tells you to contact a medical supply company for them. Put your money elsewhere."
3,Not what I expected.,"I purchased the Hayden 2671 fan clutch from Amazon because they had the best price by far and it is a name brand product not a generic. The description from Hayden states OE fit and appearance etc.. I am installing it on my 2001 Toyota Tacoma v6. It is lighter and smaller than the OE. Nowhere near as beefy and as heavy duty appearing as the original. However it does fit and is correct for the vehicle according to Hayden. I have my doubts about it's longevity. The original lasted 141,000 miles and I will be very surprised if this lasts half as long. It seems to be very light duty. Time will tell and I hope I am wrong. Also I wanted to mention that it is Made In The USA. Go figure. I buy a part for a japanese vehicle and it is made here. How ironic. I hope that means it is better made than it appears."
2,Easy to understand,This is not for newer users to NLP. There are concepts inside only for the more advanced users.
3,ok,"honestly, I cant remember why I bought this book. If I read it, it made no impression on me. If I didnt, then that speaks for itself. Anyone looking for advice like NLP, should read Awaken the Giant Within. This is nearly the only book you will ever need on personal development."
1,not happy,"I have a lexmarkx83.and it hasent work from day one.it's either putting to much ink out or not printing nothing at all. wont print out the way it previews letters it comes out all spread out of format ,got it with my gateway comp, they wont look at it or even exchange. this is my second letter to lexmark ,still have heard nothing .all I want is a new printer that works. I would like to trade it in for a step down one that is without the fax in it . its black and silver . thank you .."
3,Does not include a USB cable,"Despite the product description, this printer does not include a USB cable. If you're buying this as a gift for someone, make sure you buy a cable to go along with it.(edit 3/28/04)I've been using this printer for more than a year now and it's performing pretty much as advertised. I've had very little trouble with either the scanning or printing fuctions. It does tend to use up ink fairly quickly, though, especially in photo mode."
1,Problem Communicating with the printer...Get use to it.,"OK. Would you like a REAL review of the printer. OK... here it is...I have had the misfortune of having [it]for 6 months it has never worked for any length of time.I have XP and before that ME, does not matter it does work on either one.Problem communicating with the printer ..will become words that you will cringe when you hear them.The printer cartridges are ...... the most expensive on the market and unlike most other printers you cannot find refilled catrges....BR>Do not waste your money this thing is a joke.. think I am kidding? I emailed ... and offered to send it back to them free!... They refused to pay shipping!!...that should give you an idea of the quality of this product.( I am not joking)I first saw the X83 and thought that it would be a great printer copier, now I see why it was cheaper than the HP.I know my review sounds extreme but I would recommend that your save your money and your sanity."
1,DO NOT BUY,"As much as I've tried to get my temper under control, the piece of crap from Lexmark has almost sent me over the edge. I've finally given up toady as I ripped the entire unit off my desk, threw it out the door, and commenced to stomp it into oblivion in the driveway, much to the horror of my neighbors.. The paper jams, printing poblems and quality is THE WORST I've ever seen.This will be my LAST purchase from Lexmark.My real rating is minus ten stars. >:-<"
1,"Yep, this thing stinks.","Well I am going to have to agree with most of the other reviewers, this thing is lousy. It has never really worked correctly, and the print quality is terrible. The scanning doesn't work too well either. I just bought a new computer, and I haven't been able to get this to work. I am fairly computer literate, but after half an hour of working with this thing it still won't work. The plug and play doesn't work since Lexmark has not updated their drivers, and the installation program from the CD's freezes up all the time. Not to mention this thing is enormous, at least double the size of a comparable replacement.Which is what brings me to Amazon today, buying something new to replace this piece of junk. Don't buy it."
2,Flimsy - A bad choice for an all-in-one,"Should you buy a Lexmark X83?The simple answer would be No.Why?The Lexmark X83 guzzles $40 ink cartridges. Design of the 'paper feed mechanism' is inherently flawed. As a draftsman, I have yet to see one print emerge with text and/or picture geometry squared at right-angles to the paper.I also had the misfortune of receiving my new Lexmark X83 with smudges under the scanning glass!Lexmark has failed to release a Windows XP driver update since November of 2002 and Firmware revisions halted at v5.81; released in January of this year. Are the firmware and driver updates important? Surely they are when the X83 still Fails to operate flawlessly in Windows XP and Windows 98SE.Simple plug and play right? Not with this printer. Keep away from the X83. Try an HP."
1,Printer stuck with unlock scanner error,"The printer is really bad, from time to time the infamous ""Unlock Scanner"" occurs - the printer would complain that the scanner lock was on while the lock was off, and despite repeated attempt to toggle the lock, cannot convince that it is really unlocked. Tilting the printer 45 degree vertical sometimes get it to work, I have to scan my pictures holding the bulky scanner! And the printing is very slow. Next time I will wait and do more research before picking up a printer."
5,Does the job without hassle.,"I use this to print real estate brochures and I must say the color quality is good. It works on my Windows XP no problem.Scans great. Copies fairly fast in B&W; somewhat slow in Hi Quality Photo Mode.It takes my envelopes and cards no problen, just do not try to insert more than 15 envelopes at a time.The ink costs the same as all the others, you know too dam expensive... but what are you gonna do?I rated this 5 stars for function and lack of any problems."
1,Too Good To Be True and Is !,Bought this printer for around $$$. Figured if I spent the cash I might get something good for my money. Wrong. Cd changed how I saved my pictures. Printer constantly ran out of yellow ink. Who knows why. I hardly used the thing and the ink cartridges ran out. Lines through the image area in everything I printed. Please save yourself a headache and the cash. Look elsewhere for a printer.
5,Excellent,"loved the item. its compact, classy and seems really well constructed. as reviewers already stated, the layers are think and should be more than enough to handle the rigors of travel. i only wish this had a small compartment or two but that would probably only make this case bulkier. this is a must for nuvi owners and is much better IMO than the garmin deluxe carry case."
2,TOTALLY INADEQUATE FOR AN EXPENSIVE GPS UNIT.,"This soft unsupportive Case DOES NOT hold GPS, Friction Mat, Cord & Connector! The weight of the items causes the bottom of the case to protrude! The Friction Mat is squeezed and the wings will bend and Rip open! The expensive F.M. Cord is bent too much to fit properly into the case! Finally, the accessories merge into the GPS section, partitioned by a velcro-attached divider that sticks to very loose interior cloth! This is a dollar store case. I will promptly return this and get a larger camera case made of Codura material! Thank-You. J."
2,Does not satisfy my needs,"To assess if this GPS carrying case will suit your needs; make a box of 4""x4""x7"", add a 7""x4"" removable divider in the middle and what you can fit into that is what you will have. The case is roomy enough that I fit a 1. Nuvi 360, 2. 120 GB Gen 6.5 Apple iPod Classic with its earphones, 3. Cable to connect Nuvi to auxiliary input of radio 4. Nuvi cradle 5. Beanbag 6. L Mount that fits on beanbag and 7. Nuvi cigarette lighter power Cable.However, for me the 4"" width is a problem as it cannot fit into a briefcase. Consequently, have I had the opportunity to inspect the case physically before the time I would not have bought it. However, it is definitely useful if you intent to carry it separately like a camera case and, hence may rate it higher. But, for my use I give it a two."
4,Nice GPS Bag,"Excellent carrying case for any GPS. My Garmin Nuvi 760 GPS, cables, and suction cup mount fit perfectly in this bag with a little extra space. The reason I bought the bag is to have everything for my GPS in one place. The bag design is very simple and functional. The divider that attaches in the interior of the bag via velcro adequately separates the GPS from the other equipment. The neoprene walls of the bag are very thick. I still suggest a tight case for the GPS since the bag may not protect the screen from scratches if it gets jostled around, but overall I am very pleased with this purchase."
2,Too large!,"Item is well made, but it is far too large. All I wanted to store was my GPS, car charger and suction cup mount. That way, I could have one small bag to take along when traveling. This bag is huge! It could hold all of that and then probably another entire GPS. It may be sturdy, but it is not a compact travel bag."
3,"Great, but smells bad.","This product is a very nice looking case that will hold all of your accessories and your garmin. The only problem? The neoprene smells awful. :( If you are sensitive to scents, then this product is not for you. It is so nice, that I had a hard time returning it. Just couldn't take the scent."
5,GPS carrying case,Excellent carrying case. Not only can it hold the Tomtom GPS but also it's accessories. I'm very pleased with it.
1,"This item was sold to me, by crooks. Bootleg copy!!!","I was hoping to get the original DVD, but unfortunate the Seller is a crook. Sold me a Bad Bootleg Copy.Beware of this Seller "" MOVIEMARS"". They would take forever to send the stuff plus they would send Bad Bootleg Copies.They would never contact you back to solve the problem. I got 2 Dvds, with the same problem. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Weeping Over Dead Willow Tree,This item was packaged carelessly and came without instructions.After contacting seller about it's care they responded with a rather curt and terse one line set of instructions.I went online and purchased a bonsai care book and followed the instructions but it died anyway.Not impressed with either the merchandise or the seller.
5,New and ready to use,I needed a bunch of spares for my travel trailer. These arrived quickly and in excellent condition. They look just like the picture.
1,Never judge a book (or a DVD) by its cover!,"I saw the cover picture on this DVD and I had to have it! After all, I love ANYTHING involving beautiful blonde girls getting together, so I'd definitely love this DVD, right?WRONG!The cover photo has nothing whatsoever to do with the 1960's-era video inside. There is very little girl/girl involvement here. It's a narrated story in black-and-white about a wild girl who has sex almost exclusively with men. Whoever marketed this one knew they had a sure loser here so instead they took a hot photo for the cover. And I fell for it. Foolish me."
4,Suspense Keeps One in Suspense,"I purchased this film because I am a fan of Eugene Pallette. I must say I was thoroughly impressed with it. Though Eugene doesn't have a huge part in it, he is in it enough to please others who enjoy him. The story has a good plot, keeps you entertained and then throws in a few twists to keep you interested. I was pleased with the ending as i didn't see it coming."
4,"""Bee"" cause it looks homey",This design was too cute to pass up & the flowers & pots along with the bugs make this brighten up a cozy room.
5,mystery.....,"A must have if you enjoy Murder she wrote, well written stories, one of the best series out there...."
1,Do not buy this set or any more of the series until fixed!,"I have had the same problem as most of the other reviewers - DVDs that stick at a certain point and won't budge.In addition, I was excited about this set because, as someone who knows the episodes nearly by heart and who is also learning French, I was looking forward to using it as a great teaching tool. Stupidly, the second season has only Spanish captions and the third season none at all in a foreign language.How utterly ignorant is this? Obviously if someone bought the first season for its French captions they would expect to have them throughout the series. What a dreadful disappointment, I can tell you.I won't buy again until the complete series (all 12 seasons) provides great viewing and identical caption choices. I called Universal, who promised to get back to me but never did.Ms. Lansbury, perhaps you can help us?! We're all more than willing to spend our money - but not on what's being provided now."
1,Ditto on the DVD quality,"I had the same problem with the episodes freezing on both Season One and Season Two. I've also had the same problem on Season Two of Columbo and Season One of McMillan and Wife. All the series are from Universal. I assume they are trying to cram the most content onto the fewest discs, and taking shortcuts to get there. I will NOT be buying anymore series from them until I read that the problem is fixed."
5,Great show,"As far as i know the reviews are to be done on the show not the quality of discs. No problems here with any discs. Thats an issue to take outside this site. Now on the show: Funny i hardly watched this show when it first came out and now ive become addicted to it. Theres just no mystery/suspense show like this on tv anymore. Its suspenseful, tasteful and with some twists of humor as well. Definately a collection to own you can watch over and over again."
3,Jessica is still writting them,Typical Jessica. The story line in most of the programs is entertaining but Jessy sometimes becomes a little too much to bear.
1,Defective DVD,"Fans of Murder She Wrote greatly appreciated the release of this series in DVD's.However, the first Three Seasons were issued in three double DVD's resulting intoeither one or both defective sides. I ordered the Series One to Four and encounteredproblems in all them."
2,"Very poor sound on the main game, Sonic 2.","The games are fun to play, and visually, everything works perfectly as far as I can tell, but the sound is poor and sometimes unnacceptable. Genesis and it's games were in stereo sound, and the games were cheaply changed to mono (why would they do that?) creating ill-effects. Some games are acceptable, but the main game, Sonic 2, is the worst one. The music of some levels is very staticy and unpleasant to listen to; some sound effects are high picthed and overly loud (getting rings- DING!!! DING!!! DING!!!); and some sound effects, such as jumping, are entirely inaudible. I own the Genesis, and there's no reason why they couldn't have made the sound just as high qualty in this. $35 is a lot of money, folks. Don't buy this unless you want to play Sonic with the sound turned off."
3,No answers to the exercises,"They claim there are more than 130 exercises, but don't provide solutions. You need to be a teacher to get a password from their web site to get an access to them. It's very dissapointing. What use of them?"
2,PC game is Better,"I love Cake Mania in PC game, that is why I bought this for my NDS. Unfortunately, this isn't fun at all. Small screen and hard to control compare to PC game. Very disappointed!"
3,Review from a 30 year old.,"I loved Diner Dash, so I thought I would try this game. It was fun, don't get me wrong. But it was just WAY too quick! I had beaten the game in 2-3 days! I only played this game at night, so it wasn't all day either. I saw better reviews for the other Cake Mania games but I wanted to play the original first. I had bought/played Cake Mania 2 after this one and it was a bit better. But, Diner Dash still wins! :-)"
5,I thought nothing could top Diner Dash but Cake Mania is my new favorite!,"I was hesitant about starting the Cake Mania series because I didn't think anything could top Diner Dash. I was frustrated at first with Cake Mania because I couldn't get Jill to walk around the bakery fast enough (I literally had it ready to trade-in). Once I finally figured out how to upgrade Jill I was hooked! I've played all 3 Cake Mania's on DS and while Cake Mania 3 is my favorite, I highly recommend all of them!"
3,its ok,the online version is easier to play with. i may not be use to using the ds lite to play this game.
3,Fun but very frustrating,This is definitely not a relaxing game to play. There are many things to juggle and a lot to keep track of. I actually tell my husband when I'm going to play just so he won't talk to me otherwise he'll break my concentration. The frustration comes into play most when frosting a cake. The frosting icons are small enough so that when you mean to hit one with your stylus you can actually wind up hitting another and that ruins a cake. There seems to be very little room for error in this game. For the $20 cost it's probably worth getting and you won't feel so bad if you decide to stop playing due to the high stress level the game creates.
5,Better than on-line,"Like most I started to play this game on-line and I loved it. When I saw that it came out on the DS I was so excited. It is the same as the PC version except smaller. I think that makes it a bit easier because you aren't chasing after buttons with a mouse, just pressing the screen with your stylus. The only thing I don't like in this version is that the frosting buttons can be hard to press because the bakery is too big to fit on the screen so to get to one side the shot has to scan over. But if you like these games cake mania is great!"
4,i got my computer back,My 6 year old always wanted to play cake mania on the computer which took up a lot of time. Now she can play on her DS. It is just like the computer game. Now I got my computer back.
1,Recovery is For Christians Only,"Que Dommage! It seems that this book does not deal with anything spiritual, that is unless you are a Christian! It almost appears that no one who wrote this book read Bill's Big Book. Yes, we all know where the 12 steps originated from the Oxford group, but please understand that the beauty and wisdom of this way of life removed the religiosity, turning the concepts of sin into making ammends. When the first page of this book clearly states that it is for those who believe in Jesus Christ, although I may believe, I know it has become an ""Exclusive"" program and has nothing to do with my own personal spiritual recovery using the 12 steps.Marc Martin"
5,A good tool to help break down barriers to recovery,I was first introduced to this workbook in a group setting. I have since used it to work on my 4th step inventory. It has been quite helpful in identifying many patterns of which I had been previously unaware. By working through the questions as directed I have been able to identify some areas in need of work. I highly recommend it to anyone that may be having trouble getting in touch with what is going on underneath the surface.
5,Great use of Language,This is a wonderful resource. It is written so that all may take ownershipof their faith statements. It is so inclusive and descriptive.
5,a must for all,"great liturgy, eloquent wording, a must for all who worships in the anglican tradition, this is highly recommended by priests in the episcopal church, a change from the book of common prayer, this is rich with beautifully bound prayers."
5,Easy to use,"The New Zealand Prayer Book is one of the easiest to use prayer books in my library. It has marks of creativity that open up prayer. Out of the 3 or 4 prayer books I have, this one is the most flexible and useful. I combine it with daily scripture reading from The Chalice Hymnal and the Revised Common Lectionary. This prayer book keeps me balanced and regular - more so than others I have."
5,Great Docudrama,A very well acted movie. It combines dialogue from the actual trial transcripts with interviews with most of the main participants. I highly recommend it.
2,Peaks and valleys,"2 1/2Garbarek's albums are rarely dull, though sometimes lacking substance. Here the lightly experimental exotic ambiance lingers too long in spots, but not without some palpable payoff."
2,NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR DEFENSIVE USE,AFTER TRYING BANDOLIERS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR DEFENSIVE USE. IT'S TOO HARD TO REMOVE SHELLS WHEN HOLDING A SHOTGUN. AT TIMES YOU HAVE TO SPIN IT AROUND TO ACCESS AMMO. WE HAVE FOUND SHOTGUN BELTS WORK BEST.
1,A bunch of New-Age bull****!,"This book is bogus. Totally bogus. I hate it! All the conspiracies are totally nonsensical and the ""proof"" is a bunch of crap too. I believe that this book is kinda like Uncle Wiggly's Fortune but don't ask me why. The Momma is the section that contains muy what? Now, what was I saying? I recommend that nobody buy this. I wish I never had."
5,Clearly written personal experience,"I have about 200 books on Kundalini. This is among the very few I have read five or six times. The original method was somewhat unexpected, since the author used a small electronic wave generator everyday for a few months before he experienced the begining of K raising. The account is vivid and well written. I am happy I bought it."
1,Blu-Ray DVD A Bag of Hammers,This DVD was advertized as a comedy and I think there was one line that we found amusing. It was very dull and boring and we destroyed it after we watched it one time.
4,The Brain Explained,"This book is fantastic for people who are conceptual learners. It made the neuroanatomy easy to understand, as well as the functional aspects of neurology. The book was actually missing page 10 and 11 (ie page 9 was printed on one page and page 12 was on the next page). Other than that, fantastic, very happy!"
3,Aqua Blaster Bummer,Unfortunately within an hour the cool feature that allows you to squirt someone around a corner split - leaving this water gun unusable - which was very disappointing for the birthday boy.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought 9 of these for a birthday party and when we tried them out before the party we found that they didn't work at all. They were very hard to fill and most of the water leaked out the bottom of the gun. Don't waste your money or time.
2,Mother Earth Blu-Ray 5 pack IMAX,"The sound quality was extremely poor and I have a professional designed Media room with a 136"" screen and the IMAX scenes were not very good at all. My family & I were extremely disappointed with the purchase and will not ever purchase IMAX Blu-Ray DVD's from amazon ever again."
3,BLU-RAY VERSION - QUALITY PICTURES,"First let me mention that the three stars are for persons who have seen BBC's Planet earth. I would give five stars to the picture quality of this current package. BUT, on the other hand, it has nothing new, the narration is detached from the nature experience. It is more about spot events and snap shots and less about a whole organic subject. The animal kill is spectacularly filmed in close-ups where in planet earth they try to avoid that."
2,Great Images Terrible Narration,"I would look elsewhere for a good documentary. The imagery is great but the narration is horrible, I think even small children would find the narration simplistic and sometimes awkward or goofy. There are much better films available that capture better imagery and have a narrator that doesn't sound like she's talking to a 2nd grade class."
2,Not worth watching,"I was very disappointed at this pack. I'm an avid nature video watcher and this pack is very disappointing. The images are not great and the sound effects are downright annoying (narration is too soft and ""music"" is too loud). I do not recommend this pack."
4,A delightful farce.,"This production of Sganarelle is delightful. The fantastic cast is able to inspire instant connections, and keep you laughing the entire time. Twists and turns delivered with perfect timing and superb acting ensure that there is never a dull moment. Combine this with a smaller set and cozy atmosphere, and it makes you feel as though you are sitting in the audience!"
3,Interesting but not compelling,"I understand why Harriet is the #1 reviewer - she put in words exactly how I felt about the book. I thought the setting and ""history"" of the period was interesting, but I just could not become attached to any of the characters."
1,mattel miss represents moroccan costumes,"I'm from morocco, i lived their for over 21 years and i have never seen any moroccan dress like that. it looks more indian ( even it is not a sari) we wear kaftans ( for special occasions) in morocco, i wish mattel made the barbie wear a kaftan, i will complain to the mgf"
4,Works at HEPA level,Works very well... but will clog faster... so be alert to that issue.But if you need to clean drywall dust or other fine dust inside the home this is what you want to use.Took off one star for price... even though the price here is the same as anywhere. The prices are just too high for such a simple part.
1,Disappointed,I have never listened to a story told in this fashion. It would have been a great story but for the CONSTANT INTERRUPTION of a narrator setting the next scene. It was so distracting I lost interest for the entire story! I never want to listen to a story told like this. It was almost painful to listen to. I barely got through tape 1 before I packed it up to give to my local library. This was a total waste of my money.
5,Beautiful!,We purchased this set of flatware for our daughter's wedding gift and it is gorgeous! The pieces have a nice weight and the overall impression is one of quality.
1,Not worth the time,"When will someone write a decent book about Cuba? My search continues. Pepper's book definitely wasn't the answer. It's way too long, her voice is annoying - she really wants to lecture readers but her training as a writer has her attempting to cover up her inner preacher. And the ""love story"" aspect is tedious, boring, and self-serving. He seems a little made up...Convenient way for her to tell us her opinions. What is most disappointing is that the author fails to take advantage of her experience and the process of writing to really deliver a memoir that might enlighten people - the kernels of truth are in the story that she barely tells of her blacklisted father...but she doesn't dig into that and how it affects her perception of Cuba, how Cuba becomes a way for her to connect to her deceased and persecuted father. This could have been so much better...both as a memoir, and a creative non-fiction piece about Cuba."
3,Not very good,"Look the same as I expected, but the material is coarse. Don't like to wear it at all."
5,Sweet episode,"Doris Roberts was nominated for an Emmy Award for her guest-starring role as ""Mrs. Bailey"" in this episode. This episode has been released by Warner Home Video before on DVD as part of a Warner Bros. 50th anniversary promotion. Hopefully Warner Bros. will soon release the rest of the series on DVD. This is also one of the few episodes where Larry is the one who does the right thing. Highly recommended purchase."
3,Not the full-length episode,"Great episode, but this episode of Perfect Strangers (""Better Shop Around"") that is being sold by Amazon is not the full-length episode. It is the version that has been cut for syndication, meaning there are parts of the show that are missing. Amazon would do well to make sure the versions of the shows they are selling are actually the original versions. Warner Bros. would do well to stop making stupid excuses and just put this whole series on DVD so the fans don't have to worry about this nonsense all the time."
2,"Magnificent voice, tortured man","There's little I can add to the reviews previously given. I also felt that the author spent too much time ""explaining"" Corelli. How sad I felt for this man who couldn't enjoy the gifts he had been born with. A man who brought so much joy to those of us who heard him and still doubted himself as a performer.I respect his privacy but would have liked to have known more about his private life, does he have children, being married to a soprano, etc. No one need ask what toll all that stress has taken on him. The last pictures of him in his 70's clearly demonstrate it.I love the CD despite the prompting heard in the background. That and the picture album are worth the price alone."
3,Note different editions,"The photo of the book cover amazon now shows (of Franco as Andrea Chenier) apparently is of the new second edition of the English language version of Boagno's book which I've read was re-written and expanded after Corelli's death a couple of years ago. But, all of the descriptive information in this amazon listing is still for the original earlier English language version that the reviews seem to be about. If you buy this book, be sure you know what you are getting. I'm not advocating for or against either version. Just pointing out a potential for confusion. And, if anyone reads the new edition and reviews it, please make clear in your review which edition you describe. Thanks!"
1,What A Mess,"I couldn't agree more with the other customer reviewers of the awe that Corelli inspires in his listeners, and what a disappointment this bio is of the great tenor. I am a magazine editor and book author, and unfortunately often have to edit (or more often reject) inept manuscripts. How did this ""author"" get into print, or better yet, how did the editors/publishers allow it? As for the included CD, I didn't have a problem with the sound of the prompter; it was a side of opera I have never heard ""live."" And the singing is great, of course. Corelli was a true artist; there's very little I can add to the other reviews here about that topic. Nevertheless, $ is a little steep for a one-disc opera recital, even by Corelli, since that was all that this package offered that was any good."
2,Corelli fans need more,We Franco Corelli fans need a good documentary and a well researched biography. This book doesn't provide any satisfaction. The author repeated how great of a tenor he was by using positive only clippings. Don't we already know how great he was? He is the most beloved tenor of the century. It's the opera world's obligation to have a respectable Corelli biography.
2,Not very informative,This book wasn't very informative. The book quoted too much of other usless sources.
1,What a shame...,"It's a shame, but there's a reason why the only glowing reviews you'll see for this book on Amazon.com are impossibly brilliant endorsements, anonymously penned by who I can only imagine to be the author or his publisher. There are so many good books out there on this topic. But writing your own reviews under the guise of ""reader comments"" is disgusting and distasteful."
5,That's pretty funny,"You complain about authors posting reviews of their own material anonymously, but you have no comments on the book... and you post ANONYMOUSLY! The book is excellent. Buy it and learn."
1,The worst pe therapy book yet,"I've read 4 other PE books (by Keesling, Mantak/Chia, Venus,and Kaplan) and this is by far and away the worst of them all. Thebook is published in very large print and bound in an ""expensive soft-cover"" that must be the reason the price is so high.IT DIDN'T HELP ME AT ALL. Specifically, I found the content to be very bland, unprovacative, and completely unhelpful. I am looking to throw my copy away. It doesn't even deserve the one star rating I gave it-objective, unbiased reader (who wishes he never bought the book)"
4,"I HATE TO DISAGREE, BUT -","I'm not the author and I'm not the publisher. I'm a guy who bought this book months ago and have used it to begin the long process of gaining control. I do not believe in easy answers and I have read lots of books and tried lots of things. I like this approach because it lays out a way to work on the problem and I think I am finally getting the hang of it. It does take time. There are not that many books on this topic and I've read them. The stop and start method is described in all of them including this book, so he is on target as far as what others are thinking. However, I believe that he adds more and this has seemed to make a difference. If you want an easy answer, don't buy this book. It may not be the best written book on the market, but it has been very helpful to me."
1,Non-Insightful,"I found this book to be completely unhelpful. The techniques are trite, and there is little psychological insight. Further, the publisher uses a VERY large print, and if the font was ""normal"", the book would have no more than 100 pages. Poorly written, poorly referenced, and completely unhelpful."
5,BEST BOOK ON THE TOPIC ON THE MARKET,"We don't understand the guy who said this book was not informative. He must have been looking for a magic bullet. My wife (who is a counselor) and I read it together and found it informative, entertaining and helpful. She's no longer blaming me for my premature ejaulation and she loved the emphasis on communication and sensuality. I liked the suggestions (and illustrations) on positions that work best. We have read other books on the topic and have found this one the best."
3,"Good, But Not Ultimate","This book gives a good survey of the equipment available from various manufacturers, both bows and accessories. It was published in 2005, so it may be a bit out of date, but the kind of equipment available probably hasn't changed much since then. This provides the information as it might come from the producer's catalog, and does not include the kind of comparative information one would expect of a review of the equipment (a la Consumer Reports), nor does it provide any technical information, such as any test results. It has a few general archery articles in the front of the book, and various tips scattered throughout. It is worth the purchase price, but I wouldn't call it ""Ultimate""."
4,Not too bad for The Mafia's 1st movie.,"The only thing that I did not like about the movie was the little acting experience that the cast has. The best job was done by Project Pat. The rest wasnt horrible, but definately needs improvement. The overall story was pretty good, and the Soundtrack is tight too."
2,movie was not good,I think they just got bored and wanted to make a movie hoping it would be a success but wrong it was not but oh well someone i know will like it or it can stay in my collection
5,Usage Outside USA,"Nowhere on the website www.amazon.com it tells the buyer if this item requires a voltage converter to be used abroad. Does it only work with 110 volts in USA, or can handle 220/240 volts used abroad."
1,not reliable,"After a year or two of very rare use (maybe once every 2 months), this charger stopped working. I can put any batteries in it and it always fails to charge. You'll know by the dreaded blinking light."
5,Definitely worth it!,"I use this charger for 6 months now. Works like a charm. Excellent quality, quick charger (batteries are really full after 15-30 min of charging). And the batteries coming with it are also very good quality and last for quite long. The only draw back with this charger: the power adaptor only support AC 100-120 V 50/60 Hz, meaning that it will not work in Europe. If you're planning on using it for a digital camera and you are traveling a lot, you might want to consider another option (although there are 240-120 V converters around)."
4,Seems to do what it says,"The batteries that come with this set work great. I was really happy with the longevity, though the Canon S2 IS I used them with purportedly has good battery usage. The charger is a bit large, and hence when I was trying to pack efficiently for a big holiday, I opted to take my smaller 6 hour charger instead. I supppose that the charger needs to be big since there is a built in fan to help cool the batteries as they charge. It is convenient to know that I can get fresh batteries quickly. Now, I only have to charge them within the 30 minutes before I leave instead of all night. I prop the charger against the wall at an angle to get better air circulation around the batteries."
2,Not for travel,"The charger works well, it really full charge the batteries in 15 minutes, of course they are very hot.But i have to confirm the others reviews, for me both big problems: Doesn't plug directly into wall and it's only 110 volts, so if you are or you have to travel outside USA you are in problems."
2,Battery are useless,The charger is OK but the batteries that come with it are useless. The batteries get drained very fast. The batteries get drained in a day even if they are not used.
4,Speed,I love the speed of this machine. I was also impressed at how long the batteries lasted in my digital camera. Oddly the second set of batteries did not last as long in my remote control. Do the batteries drain even when not in use?
2,Nice Charger BUT the batteries are junk,"No problems with the charger as it works as advertised. The batteries are a different story as they discharge very, very fast. They barely last a week even when not in use! The batteries supplied with the charger are Sony typ.2500mAh. Very unhappy with the life of the batteries."
3,I didn't like it,"1)This is not a world wide charger2)Weighs nearly a pound3) Doesn't charge in exactly 15 mins, you need to hold the batteries in the charger for 10 more minutes.4) only 80% of the battery will be charged, but that should be ok for most of us5) Giving 4 AA 2500 mAh batteries is good, but better ones, 2600 mAh ones can be bought at microcenter.com for 6$ only.6) I would suggest to go for quick-world wide charger. if you are at home, you need not go for quick charger, instead you can buy some more rechargeable batteries."
2,Another Sony product bites the dust...,"I must have a Sony curse or something... everything I buy from them breaks right after the warranty expires... 2 camcorders, 2 discmans, my PS2...This worked great for a while, but then started rejecting batteries left and right. I had to re-insert them about 10 times to get the charge to begin. Ironically, it won't charge the included Sony batteries at all, but still kind of works with my energizers..."
5,Great product,"This product is great for when you need a quick charge. The batteries do come out hot, but that's to be expected. This product does what it promises."
5,Does the job,This pretty much takes 15 minutes or less to charge 2500mah batteries. Batteries do tend to get pretty hot but the fan helps a bit. The fan wasn't as good as the Duracell 30min charger but the duracell takes longer to charge 4 batteries. I've only used this once so far and it charged the batteries pretty well.
5,The fastest charger,"I bought this charger for potential convenience and that is exactly what I am getting. I was a bit wary about the 15 min charge claim but does this to full power. I have no problems with battery life , it lasts . Cameras , remote control toys ,flash lights , it supplies the juice and refills fast for lots of fun.Automatic cut off works fine .I recommend this to anyone."
1,"5 star for the first week, 0 star thereafter","I may gave this product 5 star if I wrote this review in its first week for its amazing charging speed, however after a year's usage, I am not hesitate to give 0 star, for the endless trouble it bring to me.First of all, this charger has a huge adapter which is not displayed in the picture, what make it even worse, it is only 110V capable, which means it is not working in other country which has 220V voltage. So travllers be aware, this is definitely not what you want.Then I found these batteries discharge very quickly, leave the battery a couple days unused, you will found they are empty in just several shoots in my digital camera.My latest find is this charger greatly shorten the battery life. Now all of the 4 AA batteries are died in just 30 cycle recharging, comparing ordinary rechageable batteries have 500-1000 recharging cycle.I finally decided to buy a new one to get me out of these troubles since I do not wish to miss the precious shot any more."
4,Strong and Steady,"I love how this cuts through my edges, but I wish it lasted longer. If I let my edging go a week too long, I go through a whole spool in one day."
2,Very expensive to operate,"I replaced my old GH-600 with the 1000 model. It does cut a line like the Panama Canal, but it is hard to replace the line and I can't even get thru my back and front yard with 1 spool!I am going to find a different model to use, as I can't afford 2 spools a week on my yard. And we're not talking about anything but an average sized lawn."
5,Replacement Spools,"Spool was a little tricky to put on only because you have to thread each line through the cover and keep tension on the line while replacing the cover or the line will unwind(quickly). Next time I replace the spool will try putting a clip on the line after it's threaded so that, hopefully, it'll more easily retain the tension. Either that or grow another hand."
3,It fits.,"No real trauma putting this into aBlack & Decker GH1000. It fits, it spins. The line lasts decently if you avoid things that will break it. Basically, there's stuff that the string will break/cut and things that will break/cut the string. Figure it out and get much longer string life.However...The string feeding system for theGH1000is about the same as any other trimmer. I don't know that the thicker string is a huge advantage either."
1,Too weak material,"After replacing the old one, which was wearing out, this product do not even last for a month after used it twice, the little opening where you have to put the string was deformed and it no longer good to use, even the trimmer work very good, but this Line String Trimmer Replacement Spool is too weak to handle the powerful spin produced by the trimmer. Very Bad design."
4,Spool,I works just fine. It's just like what I got w/ the hedger from Sears. It's good to know that I can stock up without having to go to the store.
1,"If this is music, then we're doomed","I consider myself an open-minded person. I have bought this CD looking for something new and interesting, and was driven by the high 4 stars grade it got on the Penguin guid to jazz that I own. But to me it was a disappointment, a casual collage of sounds, some speeches in broken english here and there, and no clue to any melody whasoever. I have just read what's written in the previous review about that Vessal's group had been living together and working hard to live up to his standards, well, I guess they got on each other's nerves! If this is music, then we're doomed..."
3,"ok game, gave a few days of fun for the kids","Xbox is pretty much gone but since I did by the game I thought I should review it. The game has great animation and voices. The kids did get stuck in a few spots and I didn't know how to get them through it but thats just me. Game is ok, not bad but not the best. If you still looking for xbox games for some reason and you have 4 to 10 year olds this will work for a while."
1,difficult,same as carouselparts don't stay together without glueparts should be numberedif you glue it as you build itand make a mistake it's ruinned
3,"Looks great when finished, but instructions and putting together the puzzle is frustrating","I thought this was a great idea for my child. Once the package arrived, we started to put it together. The problem was that the instructions were confusing and the pieces weren't interlocking right together. Just to hold it in place, we used glue, which was really messy! This project took all day to make, and it kept falling apart! I don't recommend this to small children that get frustrated easily."
3,Not what was the one on TV,"Its not the same one that was on TV for 2011 finals. But still entertaining. I missed the return date because I did'nt watch it in time of Amazons ""cut off return date"" So I got screwed & I'm stuck with it. Test your orders right away or you will get screwed if the product is bad or wrong."
5,Peerless Portuguese guitarist,"Cabral is the greatest living exponent of the Portuguese guitar. His own compositions -- many of which include uncharacteristic dissonances, harmonies and structures -- break new ground for the instrument. This CD is a studio recording and has better sound than the other available releases. His live performances on FMS and Netwerk are also worthwhile but are out of print, so grab them if you get a chance. Be advised, however, that a lot of the same pieces appear on all three CDs."
1,hugely disappointed,"Having been introduced to the Lisbon sound of Fado with the likes of Madredeus, Mariza, Christina Branco, Ana Moura, Dulce Pontes, Amelia Rodrigues, and a host of other fine singers and discs, I had always been impressed with the arrangements and accompaning guitar ensembles. For this reason I decided to perhaps broaden my exposure to Portuguese music and ordered this disc.I was hugely disappointed. Not only does one song nearly sound like the next and the next and the next and almost seamlessly flow into each other (you can tell they end by the long pause between each one) but the overall recording quality of this disc is very poor.I can not recommend this disc to anyone. Hey, that's my opinion, but isn't that what these reviews are about? For my money, I'd stick with known guitar ensembles and quality recordings from the likes of Madredeus."
5,My daughter loves this book.,"I couldn't disagree more with the previous commenter. Yes, it is a very simple story. Isn't that the point? We wouldn't want our kids reading Voltaire right off the bat. Getting back to the book...A simple story, colorfully and beautifully drawn. When we read it to my 16 month old, she is drawn to the boldness of the illustrations. She often sits, turning pages and looking at the pictures while telling us a story. When we read it to her we add lots of sound effects. Lots of fun."
1,"Just a stupid, stinky, dirty goose that got lucky...","I don't know who this author is trying to fool. Geese are naturally dirty, stinky animals. Have you ever smelled a down pillow? This is just a stupid little story about a nasty, dirty little goose who refuses to bathe, and tricks other geese into not bathing and into getting even stinkier and dirtier than they might have ordinarily been and manages to hide from an even stupider fox (who, if it had any sense, would not be cavorting about with such nasty animals anyway). I guess cleanliness is not next to Godliness for geese. That's probably why we can shoot them, cook them, eat them, and use their feathers to keep us warm too (if you choose to put their filthy feathers next to you that is). Avoid this tale at all costs."
1,Beautiful Dreams: Live,"Don't buy the DVD Beautiful Dreams:Live if you live in the USA, it will not play on your DVD player and Amazon does not respond when you want a refund. Presented as 'all regions' it is only for regions 2-6, Europe etc. Amazon has made no effort to even correct the information given about the DVD. This is totally wrong."
2,Beautiful Dreams,"This DVD is advertised as a region 1 (Canada & USA). But DVDwon't play in DVD players thats in us market. By looking on thecover it says ""Made in Germany"" Region 2-4-5-6-7."
3,"Region 1 DVD (Canada, USA) ?","This DVD is advertised as a region 1 (Canada & USA). This DVDwon't play in my 5 players that i own. By looking on thecover it says ""Made in Germany"" Region 2-4-5-6-7. So i'll aska friend to decrypt it and make a copy i can play on my machines.Is it the seller or are all the DVD's like that ?"
1,Biblical compromise!,"Dr. Ross believes and teaches in this book that the earth is millions of years old, and that it started with the Big Bang. He claims that the days of creation were overlapping periods of millions and billions of years, and that death and bloodshed have existed from the beginning of Creation and were not the result of Adam's sin. He also teaches that the flood of Noah's day was local, not global. His teachings clearly contradict both Scripture and science! If you would like a good book that argues against Dr. Ross' belief in 'Progressive Creation', you should purchase 'Creation and Time - A Report on the Progressive Creationist Book by Hugh Ross' writen by Mark Van Bebber and Paul S. Taylor."
2,One sided presentation of evidence,"Ross' work is a good example of what happens when someone with little philosophical sophistication dabbles in the discipline. Ross' knowledge of science and cosmology is to be commended, but when he tries to explain the philosophical/religious implications of scientific findings he makes numerous naive and elementary errors in reasoning. I am a Ph.D. in philosophy and am frequently frustrated by the presence of books such as this. For all the attention it has received, the claim that our universe shows marks of divine craftsmanship is nothing more than an attempt to use contemporary science to resurrect the old argument from design. The argument was thoroughly refuted by David Hume more than 200 years ago and the addition of new scientific discoveries does nothing to change that. --Greg Klebanoff <klebanoff@hotmail.com>"
1,"Not sure of ownership, but sure of his bad theology","I have a book of Ross' by the same title, but the cover is different (remake?) but most of my problems with his theology come from his advocation of the ""big bang theory"" which has numerous scientific problems (quantized redshifts to name one) and serious theological implications. If the big bang were true, then there were animals before man. Animals that lived and died. The Bible says that man's sin is the reason why we die and suffer. If death was around before sin (""For the wages of sin is death"") then what good would Jesus' death on the cross have been?"
5,A very good book for the celestial doubter!,This book attempts to put togeter an argument for the existence of God through the structure and processes of the cosmos. The universe is a masterpiece that has the signature of a Creator that put it all together and continues to maintain it through creative power. A very good book for the scientific-minded or for the overly left brain among us who need to see it to believe it.
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this watch about a year ago, and I stopped wearing it after a couple months. It is of very poor quality. I bought it because I liked the looks of it, and thought it might be a good deal. I was wrong. It loses about 3-4 minutes a week, and the crystal is not saphire, and therefore not scratch resistant. Soon after I started wearing it, I had a HUGE scratch all the way down the crystal, that even damaged the bezel. Stay away from this watch, it is not worth nearly what is asked for it."
4,Realy nice watch,nice watch it has been mistaken for a Rolex and a jeweler wanted to buy it 100 hundred more than wath i paid but it's a very hevy and big watch so i recomend this watch
2,Whisper No more,"It is quiet, but it doesn't last very long, it was less than a year. I am going with Rena this time."
3,"Not ""whispering""","The hanging rubber diaphragm is low quality(Took apart the unit but it wasn't broken). It puts out plenty of air, but not at a whisper. If you need a lot of air and a small vibrating noise doesn't bother you then this is for you."
3,Whisper not so quiet,"Got this pump this christmas to replace a cheap petco brand of the same size. This one puts out a ton of air, but at the cost of noise. I read a ton of reviews saying how quiet this pump was...well, its not quiet at all. I can hear this thing in my bedroom when trying to sleep, and this is out in the kitchen/living room. Disgusted at how loud it is, yet amazed at how much air it puts out."
2,Not a Whisper,The hum from this pump is far from a whisper and is just as loud or louder than other pumps
4,Powerful Pump,"This air pump is more than sufficient for my 55 gallon freshwater tank and powers my 28"" air stone very effectively. It should be noted that this pump comes with 2 valves and a splitter all of which make this pump more diverse. My only complaint is that it is kind of loud, this however is to be expected with most air pumps."
2,not very quite at all,"I bought this hoping that it was going to be as quiet as it decribed... I could actually hear it in the next room. Wisper doesn't even come close. Ironically, right on the box, it states, ""The New Shape of Silence"" and boasts sound dampening chambers, eliminates sound producing vibrations, thick walls insulate motor noise..."" There was absolutely nothing quiet about it... There is no way I could listen to the pump all day long at the noise level it produced... Not sure if I would recommend as I never got a chance to use it, nor did I want to at that sound level... Gonna buy another and hope that it was an isolated incident... maybe I might go to a store and have them plug one of the floor displays in and see if it is also as loud first..."
4,Noisy?,I have no idea why there are complaints regarding the noise of this unit. It is very quiet. I am using one outlet for one side of an undergravel filter and the other to the opposite side of the same filter.Of course I know that the moment my plastic drop tube start to plug the pump will get noisy and blow out the diaphragms. Too bad they can't improve on the diaphragm material as it is the only part of any pump I have ever had fail. Over and over and over........
1,Know what's in the Box!,"I just got home with one of these from Wal-Mart. On the outside of the box, it says nothing about needing a shelf 12"" or higher behind your tank for the pump to sit. It needs this for proper airflow. It also doesn't say anything about needing ""air control valves"" to get the best use from the pump. And, of course, it doesn't mention that you'll need your own rubber hose(s) to connect to this thing. I needed this tonight! Now, thanks to Whisper, I'm making another trip out. I look at the bright side of things, and will opt for a different brand, and try to do some studying at home next time (I didn't have the time to this time, unfortunately) Frank"
5,works great,I've never had an issue with these.. I have purchased a few of these in my aquarium keeping hobby. I like the rubber feed on these because they tend not to fall off over time. very quiet and reliable.
3,ahhh ok i guess,"not very powerfull at all, i have a 10 gallon of the same brand and it isnt much less, save your money or buy a different brand... for a 60 gal its weak, but it is quiet"
5,Exellent product,"I feel this is the most quiet unit available, and I have tried a few. Excellent volume output and easy set up. This is my second unit as the cats got the best of the first--so not a product failure. Lasted over a year with no issues. Would highly recommend this pump for anyone with a fish tank located in a high traffic area."
2,Loud as can be,"What none of these reviews seem to mention is how crazy loud this thing is. It says WHISPER but there's nothing whisper about it. It's so loud that I can exit my bedroom at the end of a LONG hall and hear it going way down in the dining room. When I use my computer way across the room, the sound from the pump sounds like it's coming from my computer and I think something is wrong with my computer. It sounds like a pump for a pool or something. It should be outside.We have both inputs hooked up. There's nothing wrong with the filter to create the sound. I guess you like stuff that is louder in your houses than anything else beside the microwave or TV? We tried wrapping some noise muffling towels and crap around it. It's still so loud. So I have major regrets after buying this thing because it's so crazy loud. We don't turn it on very often. But as far as pumping air goes, it does a great job."
1,Not quiet,"I bought this because it was listed as being quiet. That's a lie. If you enjoy loud, vibrating noise for your aquarium- this would be perfect for you."
2,Whisper was not proper name for this pump,"After setting up this pump, I could hear it all over the house. The output was great and the price was too. I replaced the Whisper with another brand(Fusion) and kept the Whisper as a backup."
4,whisper pump,"nice pump, big size, would be nice if it had a nail mount to hang from the wall to install per manufacture recomindations"
4,Tetra Air Pump 60-gal,"Powerful- however, not so quiet. between the motor of the pump and the bubbles there is to most a pleasant and constant increase in volume."
2,Incredibly Noisy,"While it does move a good amount of air, the Whisper 60 emits an incredibly loud buzzing noise. The noise can really fill a room and quickly become very annoying. The Whisper AP150 I bought to replace this is much quieter (even quieter than my Whisper 10) and the closest I've seen an air pump get to ""silence."" This one, however, is quite the opposite."
4,Nice!,"Good airflow but a bit (not too bad) noisy. It comes with 2 air outlets so I use them to power a 47"" air diffuser and a sponge filter. The noise is there, but not too bad. I'm going to be changing my setup to a sump filter so it'll be under the tank and hopefully won't be heard at all. But at this price, it's a great buy."
1,Too loud,"Way too loud for me. I used mine on a 46 gal tank, ran 2 lines to air stones. Placed it in a closed cabinet below along with a silent Fluval 306. LOUD. Placed it on foam pad to reduce transmitted vibration and harmonics, then wrapped it in several layers of foam, nothing helped. Hung it from the back of the tank wrapped up, no good. Finally took it apart, nothing was broken or loose, nicely made in fact, but I guess the basic design gets stretched when pumping this much air. It did pump a decent amount of air.Of course, doing all this I missed return date by 2 days."
3,"Loud in 29gal, ok in 75 gal",I would expect it would be as the name implies. I have 2 new ones. One of them powers 2 sponge filters in a 29gal and the other powers a bubble wand in the 75gal. The 75gal is deeper so I am guessing that the back pressure dampens the noise some what. It is louder than the slightly less powerful azoo it replaced.
2,It's not quite,"I bought this to replace my slightly loud pump. I was surprised to find that it was louder then the one I was replacing. Good thing about it is that it is really powerful but the noise is very important to me. Had to return it, I'm going to keep on looking for a replacement."
2,not quiet,"Got this for my tank because I thought it was going to be quiet. It is not quiet at all. It does put out good air, so I will keep using it. But I was really hoping for something that I couldn't hear running."
2,Watch out for outdated information.,I bought this book thinking it would be really great to find some new and different places to take my son. Well we have gone to these new areas but didn't get to do anything because they were out of business. I'm sure that they were all there in 1998 but it is now 2001 and there should have been some updating and checking on these places. I already knew of quite a few places in the book by doing web searches. Save yourself the money and look for places on the web.
5,solid Dogma pic,"very solid dogma style picture, multiple directors give you separate takes on the real world as we see it at street level, definitely a solid watch for a film buff who enjoys life and European style cinema."
5,"""Throwback"" is about more than just wrestling","Amateur wrestler Ben Petrovic moves to a new school. Whether you like amateur wrestling or not (I've never watched it), this is an excellent novel about high school life. There's a major revelation after the sample that I didn't see coming (though it is mentioned in the plot description on this page, so avoid that if you don't want to know).Author Dave Conifer is obviously well-versed in the art of amateur wrestling. The attention to detail present here could only come from a true insider and aficionado. However, he is just as well-versed when it comes to the lives of teenagers. As a result, his characters are realistic and easy to relate to.Whether you're an amateur wrestling fan or not, ""Throwback"" is well worth the read."
4,Good read,"Enjoyable read. Well paced, with a protagonist worth knowing. I didn't find the end particularly satisfying - almost as if the author reached an escape point and bailed out of the story. I hope there is a revision someday - the story certainly deserves a stronger conclusion."
1,I am disapointed,"when i saw this video at your shop i get very glad because i love the wine, and the title is very interesting, but when i saw the dvd i become very disapointed because it takes only 15 minutes long, and that is not a really documental."
4,Philippine education,"This book was a delight to my wife who grew up in the Philippines and an education for me, helping me to understand the fairy tales different from my US upbringing."
2,A confusing read,"I speak, read and write Filipino and I am quite knowledgeable on its folklore and legends.I have never heard of these myths, most probably because it may be in Visayan language but the grammar and word usage is outright confusing.""Comusta pari"" I think should be ""Kumusta, pare?"" (From Spanish Como estas- How are you?, Pare is like a male chum/friend).The author might have cited that the stories were of Visayan origin too.The construction of the sentences/paragraphs is quite lanky too."
1,Boring Reading.,"Talk about the worst story telling I have ever come across. The stories are told as if someone else is talking and the author is taking it all down in shorthand. Too bad. I was looking forward to some fun reading. You won't find it in this tiny, cheaply made collection of stories. It isn't a book. It's a rip-off. I use it as an examle of bad writing. Filipino story-telling is fascinating..colorful...dreamlike. None of that is contained in this tiny collection. What a complete bummer!"
4,Culture & History makes for an Interesting Read,Old country type stories are interesting. Old world views enlightens a person on how different and similar we all really are.
1,Unknown Stories,"I bought this book through another site and gave it tothe son of my Filipino Friend. Curiously enough, myFriend told me these Folklores are completely unknownto him and his wife. He is from the Visayas and his Spousefrom Ilocos.They wondered where these stories came from. Unknown andnever popular among the Filipinos."
1,Looked Cheap,The costume looked cheap and was not returnable....I ended up making my own because I was not satisfied with the quality of the item.
4,Invicta Women's Lady Watch Rellay Good,i can say it's very nice watch and really made good quality and very Cute any who want to buy this watch i say go a head and you never lose with Invicta Watch.
2,"Quality Materials, Poor Quality Control","I bought the Invicta 2959 Lady Abyss after admiring the look of this Divers style watch and reading several positive reviews. I am pleased with the quality of the materials used, the size, color, style, and comfort. However, the lack of attention to detail and quality control by Invicta is severely lacking. The bezel is off center and the second hand is slightly off the mark, so every time I glance at the time piece I notice these obvious flaws. I have several watches, from Rolex to Fossil and this Invicta is the first time piece that is truly disappointing."
2,"Pretty, pretty boring!","A very boring, hard to control, unenteresting game the side scroller, original game works better and is far more funner."
4,Gift,I'm giving this journal to my mother for Christmas this year after my father passed away suddenly. I hope it gives her an outlet for grieving...
2,Not ready for it,"Not what I was wanting...not ready to delve into all the emotions of my loss. Was hoping this would be more of a chance to celebrate memories of my loved one - not write down all the loss and regret, etc."
2,Why does everyone rate this book so highly?,"The recent Star Trek novels aimed at bridging gaps, such as what the Enterprise was doing during the Dominion War and so forth, are failing miserably. The only good ones are the Deep Space Nine series.I give this book two stars because the authors really tried. I mean, they put a lot of effort into making this believable, into making Deanna a mad li'l Betazoid.But it doesn't work. None of it works except the against-all-odds battle between the Enterprise and the enemy -- the book was so forgettable that I even forgot who they were fighting.This book is a waste of time unless you're an absolutely inconsolable Star Trek fan. Read Mission Gamma instead.And please... whomever's editing at Pocket, and coming up with these books... it's not working. Hire some fanfic authors, like Gina Dartt. They at least can craft a story."
3,"Not bad, not great.","As an action-packed Dominion War story, this book works well. As a subtle story dealing with difficult ethical questions and psychological crises (which it aspires to be) it fails pretty thoroughly. If you're looking for a quick, exciting read, it'll do nicely. Just don't let it get your hopes up for more. And the solution to the primary ethical dilemma was a real deus ex machina copout."
4,Realistic and thought provoking,One of the things I enjoyed about this book is that it did not sugar coat war. This title is a little darker than your average trek novel as the authors provide a realistic look at not only the physical horrors and atrosities of war but at the psychological impact as well. Well done and thoroughly enjoyable.
4,Great Read,"It's about time that they did something with Deannas homeworld, Early in the series of books they had done two books on Tasha Yars world and Worfs ofcourse,The Dominion war was a tragic time for the Federation and we had until now heard from all the aligned worlds we knew of except Betazed. Seeing Lwaxana Troi ready to free an insane criminal just to learn how to declare war was very interesting.I'm glad the writers had Riker & Deanna starting to rekindle the romance they once shared.Well Done"
2,Betazed,The book is empty and nothing really happens. They want to use a killer to save a planet but at the last second don't use him. The book tries to deal with hard issues. But ends up with easy answers. It is worth a read if you like to know what happened to Betazed. Troi is barely in the book. Whenever she is in it she is always questioning herself.
5,love it,good quality remindes me of when i was young.good condition of product.buy it you will love it. thank you amazon
2,shows dirt,"Pros:Nice designNice color combinationEasy to extend under furnitureChair rolls easily on itCons:Shows dirt REALLY bad before you can even put the vacuum away.Puffy. Doesn't lie flat.Very thin. Definitely doesn't keep room warm. On the other hand, I have a stand that has one wheel that has to sit on this rug, and the stand doesn't wobble, because the rug is so thin.I've had this rug down one day, and I'm already planning its replacement in next month's budget. Every speck and hair shows. The replacement I've selected has a lot of gold and black, but the pattern is such that it looks very clean."
4,"Very affordable rug, could be thicker","This a a functional rug and you get what you pay for when it comes to this product. The box it came in caused the ends to be tucked under itself and so several days later, the rug still is not laying flat. Very nice color and seems durable."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT,THIS RUG IS PERFECT.....SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T MAKE DECISIONS BY READING OTHER REVIEWS...YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT AND I'M GLAD I DID....THIS RUG IS BEAUTIFUL AND WORKS GOOD WITH MY DECOR....I'M A VERY PLEASED CUSTOMER...
3,For specialists,"Titles of 190 collections. Extremely brief details on the author, dates, contents, and editions, plus citations for bibliographies that cite them."
1,No way,"I chose Zicam because I love their other products but unfortunately I did not feel the same way with this product. I don't know what they put in this stuff but I will not be taking it again. Sure, it cleared up my sinuses due to congestion but it left me feeling high/drunk, so much so that I did not even feel comfortable driving. I thought it was supposed to be a spray but it shot a straight stream into my nose. The next day it left me with all I can explain was a ""hangover"" with my congestion worse than it was the day before. I did not drink any alcohol before, after or during taking this so there is no other explanation why I felt that way. I will not recommend this product and in fact I already threw it away. What a waste."
1,"The Best of Classical Guitar, Vol. 1",Not what I expected at all. I do not like this CD and would not recommend it.
2,Warning! NOT for carpet over carpet use,"Husband loved the design too much to pass up, and my expectations were unfortunately met. This is barely better than covering your floor with a giant blanket. The backing is only a spaced thin cloth weave. We tried to use it under a pine table with 4""x4"" thick legs on carpet with a universal gripper, and it was stretched, rippled up enough to trip, and basically ruined in only 5 days!You get what you pay for, and this carpet would be OK in a low traffic hard floor area with a quality floor gripper."
2,Not Happy,"It's a pretty pattern but when I ripped off the tag on the back the it took the material with it leaving small holes in the corner...to me a sign of a cheaply made rug. Plus it ""walks"" every time you step on it so it's constantly wrinkled. All in all, not very pleased."
1,Super thin. Not worth the $100.,"Super thin. The description says .5 inch thick- try <.25 inch. Not worth the $100. We sent it back and got a MUCH nicer one that was $280, but so much more vivid and plush."
3,This is a dvd only a capcom or powerstone fan would love.,"This Dvd was fairly decent but i only recommend for the powerstone and capcom fanatics. Its got decent animation, fair to capcom, and a so so story line. But i recommend it to die hard capcom/powerstone fans. If your curious about it and arent those kind of fans then i reccomend renting it. worth the curiousity."
2,flimsy,"These three puzzles are made of very thin cardboard that curls quite easily. For the amount of time that the pieces can be placed together, the puzzles themselves are fun to put together, but they are simply not sturdy enough."
1,Avoid,"You know its worthless when the band itself disavowed this pile of goop. In short, it's a import of the worthless Renassanice album that came out a few years ago and is now deleted. Better packaged, but the concert still sounds like it was poorly recorded and recorded very slowly. Forget this turd."
5,The best saxophone CD,"This is the best saxophone CD. With being a student playing the Creston, I use this as a reference, because it is so great. I plan on studying the othe pieces on this one. This CD is awesome."
1,Bad Software,I bought this and got Amazon's usual good service. That's the good news. This software is lousy! The design objects don't even include common things like bath vanities. They must want you to use a kitchen base cabinet but the depth and height are wrong and you can't change either. The length you can change.Tech support is $10 per phone call or $5 per email. What arrogance. DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE.Bill in Lansing Iowa.
5,Inspiring and enjoyable book about civil rights and advocacy,"Not much time for a long review.. I had to read this book for a class so wasn't looking forward to it. The book turned out to be fantastic. It's about Myles Horton, a civil rights leader and advocate. He writes it like he's talking to you, so it's very easy to stay involved in the book. I also really enjoyed the countless insights he made about a number of different things. It's based in the 1930s through the 1980s. Mr. Horton was actually a mentor of sorts for Martin Luther King, Jr. Not a very descriptive review, but if you're looking for a civil rights/advocacy oriented book, I highly recommend this."
3,Self-Loving Erotic Photography,"I was given this book by a friend thinking I would be titalated by the photographs. While the men pictured are photographed well for the most part (and are quite attractive), I was disturbed by how Mr. Bianchi photographs himself and appears to be having sex with a model in one of the images. It leads me to believe there is more happening here than just a love of photography. And since Mr. Bianchi has acknowledged publicly that he is HIV +, I wonder what these sexual encounters say to the public. The quality of the photographs are great, though. :)"
1,Let's go nowhere,"What happened to maps?!?!? In Paris, a real guide containing maps showing Rues (streets) without its names it's absolutely useless. That kind of disappointing tools you will find in this supposedly updated guide, only a very skin deep varnish about the City of Light. Instead, I recommend to pick one of those free brochures in the Metro or change offices. These can give you a much better information about where you are...in Paris."
1,sure it looks fun,but who would want to play with a doll that looked like that. you wouldn't want to destroy her beautiful curls or her dress. and that lamb. small and plastic. come on. if you're gonna call her mary then make her look like mary. by the way...didn't mary have gollden curls?
3,Product comes up short,"The cord itself is much shorter than on the original; this is obviously a potential problem. From reading online, the most common reason for replacing these is cord separation at the plug. Now that I know, I'm going to reinforce mine with electrical tape."
2,laptop charger pack,"the charger pack worked for a short time, however the end that plugs into the laptop had a wire seperate from the plug, i had to replace the pack already and i didn't appreciate having to spend the money yet again for it, but i guess you get what you paid for!"
1,"Wrong connector, wrong power output...","I've read a few favorable reviews, so I took a chance and ordered one for my Thinkpad T60. It came with a wrong connector, so I can't use it. The rated power output is 18.5V and 77.5W instead of the required 20V and 90W. I've requested full refund. I would not buy anything from this seller, Sunvalleytek(Since they sold it through Amazon) I am sure Amazon will stand behind its name)."
1,NOT WORTH THE LOW COST,"Don't waste your money or time on this IBM Lenovo look-alike charger. It didn't even last two months before the transformer started getting too hot to touch (I was worried about a fire) and the plug to the computer was hot, too. Buy an OEM charger (as I did the next time around). You will be much happier."
1,A waste of my money,"This product stopped working after less than two months. I was using it as a backup power source at home, so I only used it for perhaps 80-100 hours. Unfortunately, it had a 30 day guarantee. It was NOT a Lenovo product."
1,Amazon won't let me rate this any less than 1 star,This is a total POS. Two days after using this my battery suffered irrepairable damage! Now 90 bucks later on a new battery I am wishing I would have spent the money and gotten the OEM adapter. Don't buy these cheap chinese knockoffs.
1,"Dangerous Product, Abysmal Quality","As soon as I plugged in this power supply, connected to my docking station without a computer in it, the power cord started to melt and filled my office with thick smoke. I'm lucky my house didn't burn down. I'm amazed the TheBatteryCenter hasn't gone out of business due to lawsuits!"
2,Works... barely,This charger was very cheap which is the only reason I purchased it. But I guess saving money comes at a price. When charging my laptop the charger block gets so hot it literally burns your fingers when you touch it. Also when charging it makes a weird noise. But I can't complain too much because it was cheap and it charges my laptop.
2,Cheap,I was looking for a cheap breadboard and I guess this fit the bill. When it arrived the box holding the precut wire was broken. The wires were all mixed together and many bent. The top right corner of the breadboard assembly itself was bent out of shape. The banana plug connectors were not installed and if I didn't have the tools it would have been difficult to unscrew the nut from one connector to be able to install it on the breadboard assembly.I've got the wires organized now. The connectors installed. The rubber feet stuck on. I need to get some super glue to fix the wire box. Hopefully the breadboard itself has more quality and I can afford to pay for a better product when it needs to be replaced.
4,Not a bad little knife!,"The Gerber Armor Tanto, for the price, is not a bad little blade and is a practical addition to any knife collection.I have not had any considerable problems with this knife; it's shaped up to be pretty reliable. It feels natural to the hand when gripping it due to the design of the handle. Very comfortable. The knife is lightweight. The dual thumb studs on the blade makes it easy for one-handed opening. There is also an alternate blade release at the top of the handle.My only problem with the knife is that its only moderately sharp even after sharpening it. However, it gets the job done.My only wish is that this knife was spring assisted!"
5,Best pull-on,"When I became urinary incontinent, I searched for the best possible pull-on adult diaper. I didn't search much for the side-attach kind because I couldn't find one that would stay on more than 30 seconds. But I did check out a lot of pull-ons. I ended up with Tranquility Premium Daytime Pull-Ons and the companion Overnight Pull-Ons as the highest quality available. I now buy these in bulk."
5,From a Native Daughter: The best on the subject,"Wonderful, intelligent, humorous--at times-- and absolutely top drawer. A must read for anyone interested in indigenous politics, peoples, lands, or issues, and Hawai'i"
5,Zildjian Cymbal for hubby,"Great shopping experience---great price, great looking product. Purchased for my Husband--matched his other stuff---he was totally happy with it!!"
1,"Lame, outdated product. Support 2GB cards and under only",It does not support media cards over 2GB. This information should be part of the technical details/specs of the unit. No one should have to read consumer reviews to find this out. Belkin is now off my list as a peripheral product provider.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!,The reader works only on cards smaller that 1GB !!!!However they do not mention it anywhere. Very disappointing.
3,"5 stars when I bought it. Great between 2005-2007. Too outdated now, should not be sold.","I bought mine a long long time ago. Way before I was using Amazon. And it's a 5 star reader... FOR IT'S TIME. When it was new and 2GB non-HC cards where the max, it read everything. And I still use it right now for my non-HC cards 2GB and under. It is the fastest reader I have used. But now I have a new camera and new cards and I need a new reader.So I was shocked when I saw Amazon selling this OLD card reader when browsing for a new reader. While the info is accurate for 2005, it needs to have updated info for now. And clearly mark it's limitations. I gave it 3 stars because when it was a current card reader it is 5 stars all the way. But it shouldn't even be sold on Amazon today! This is a legacy product, and should not be sold as current. So I give it 3 stars because it's now 2010 and this reader really does not belong on the current market."
1,Outdated,"Maybe 5 years ago this was an ok product, but today it is outdated and isn't working with even low end current memory cards. I spend $15 on a 4gb card to put into a photoframe and was annoyed that this reader apparently can't handle the ""high capacity"" (4gb!) cards. Buy something newer."
2,doesn't work with 4GB SD card,"Just bought the Belkin USB 2.0 Multimedia Reader and Writer (product number F5U249V) and found that it doesn't read the 4GB SDcards, as some others have noted. It is also has proven to be unreliable - when a card is inserted, it doesn't necessarily recognize the card. It required unplugging the mini USB cable and plugging it back in. A shame, Belkin products used to be very reliable. I will be taking this Belkin product back."
4,"Good, yet lacking detail on some vital topics","Like other books on the market, this book offers examples and case studies of successful professionals. Mills emphasizes the critical value of winning the attention of your audience or customer. Would like to have seen a bit more on developing the right verbal skills to permit one's message to be heard in a world where everything demands our attention."
2,A great disappointment,"This books covers a lot of persuasion tatics. However it does not discuss any of them in details, with little guidance on how to put those tatics into practice.I would say I much prefer the books by Cialdini than this one. However you have to be careful with investing in Cialdini's books as I have observed that he has published one book under two different names.P."
2,"Needs more practical, immediately useable points","I was hoping for something with greater specifics on turning negative situations around. The title sounded more action oriented to me than the book actually was. This was a bit more philosophical and psychological. I am looking for practical solutions that I can apply now. The best I have found so far was ""The Secret Handshake"" I would like to find more books like that for real specifics of how you can prepare, plan and change an interaction. The only problem with ""The Secret Handshake"" was that it ended, just when you begin to feel empowered."
2,Better off buying books by Robert Cialdini,"This book clearly speaks to some interesting research concerning persuasion and influence, however, it appeared to me that anyone with exposure to Dr. Cialdini's research would find this repetitive and more focused on training those who would wish to become ""black market"" persuaders. I might also argue that the more interesting parts of Mr. Mills book appeared to be a re-write of Cialdini's work.While it is an o.k. book for those with no background in persuasion or social psychology, I would recommend reading ""Influence-Science and Practice"" and/or ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"" by Dr. Cialdini. Many of the points made in Mr. Mills books relates to the research studied in both of these books. However, Dr. Cialdini's books are more enjoyable to read, more informative and instructive, and clearly speaks to the ethics of persuasion with sincere eloquence."
3,"A rewrite of ""Influence Science and Practise""?","On the whole this is a good book but I am only giving it 3 stars due to the fact that the last half of the Book is almost a word for word rewrite of ""Influence Science and Practise"" by Robert Cialdini.This book contains a lot of useful tips on how to influence groups as well as individuals which makes it useful for public speakers and Marketing people and not just salesman."
5,Best quality for the price,"I'm a carpenter, and I've been using these Makita saws for over 30 years. I usually try to buy American made products, but I make an exception when it comes to these saws. I've seen them dropped off rooftops; dropped in a lake; dropped onto concrete floors, etc., and they're like the Energizer Bunny, they just keep going and going.These saws are extremely durable, and I've used them every day for years and years, with nothing more than an odd trigger or brushes replacement. I just wish American-made products were this good!"
3,Does Not Always Fit Right,Product arrive ahead of schedule but it seems to slip down and render some of the buttons un-usable. I don't think I would recommend this.
2,Poorly made,"Continually slipped down, at one point was actually putting tension on the trackstick on the Garmin. After maybe 10hrs of use the neoprene to clear plastic stitching started to come undone. Overall just seemed cheaply made and not really made to help ruggadize a GPS."
4,Excellent value over other Garmin accessories,This case replaces two separate Garmin cases that wold cost you over $[...] at retail prices. The case has a loop that replaces the Garmin Bike Mount and the hanging loop that replaces the windshield mount. The one drawback was no accommodation for the rear port so I had to make a small hole in order to run this with the battery charger I got but it now works like a champ. I use my Garmin to run tours in at [...] you can see more details there.
4,Speech work for beginners,This book has really been a great help in my speech class. I am slowly learning how to speak in a neutral American dialect and also learned a lot about IPA format.
3,substitution,The merchandise shipped was not what was pictured on the site and I ordered because of my familiarity with the product and was sent something else.
1,Awful Writing and Worse Editing!,"Sorry, but this is a travesty. Despite the author's good intentions, the book is practically unreadable. The constant errors in grammar and punctuation are overwhelming. Sentences without verbs (like this one)! I guess we'll have to wait until the new bio of Greene comes out in early 2005. I hope (and suspect) that the new bio is as good as Greene deserves!Edit/Update: Having read the Golway, it really didn't deliver either. It's not tortuous to read but, as noted by another reviewer, Anderson's has more depth. I'm really sorry it's so hard to read."
5,Top Quality,"Great product! I like everything about it, great suction, well built, made in USA even! Well worth the money."
5,great little vac,"Have used this small but powerful vacuum in the house, shed and garage. It is fantastic - beats my home upright for its sucking power! Haven't yet used the blower function, but it's good to have when you need it. Great product."
3,As a car vacuum it's pretty good,"I've been using one of these small powerful vacuum cleaners for years on my cars. I like the 4 hp. 5 or 6 hp would be even nicer.Pros: Small, easy to take apart and clean. Easy to carry. Reliable.Cons: The power cord is way too short. Also it needs a dolly or cradle.It would be nice to have a longer flex hose so that the vacuum canbe on the ground, outside of the car instead of being on the seat.I also feel that it is extremely overpriced. The problem is...there is little market competition for this style of vacuum cleaner."
1,2 Problems With This Vacuum,"I bought this vacuum on a lightning deal but will return it. I have used this vacuum for about 30 minutes vacuuming in my laundry room and in my garage, and 2 flaws made themselves apparent. (1) Never buy this vacuum without purchasing the ""Metro Vacuum Optional Four-Wheel Dolly"" which is currently out of stock. Without it, you need to carry this vacuum with the shoulder strap or resign yourself to having it roll around on the ground like a fish out of water. Even four simple feet would keep this thing from rolling about. Without them, this is such a sad design for anything other than vacuuming your car. (2) in the 30 minutes of vacuuming, the front fell off twice dumping the vacuumed contents onto the floor. I think my vacuum is defective with the clamps not holding the front on tightly.Having to carry this thing around like a handbag and having it dump its contents on my shoes is a no go in my book."
4,my review,"I received and have used my vacuum and am pretty happy with it except for the vacuum attachments. The attachment head provided with the Metro to vacuum the floor of my car sucks, there is no opening on the attachment fitting and there is so much sucking powerthat it's hard to pull it off the carpet, so I couldn't use it and had to resort to just the hose opening. The other thing is the length of the hose, it absolutely needs 3 more feet. Other wise I'm very happy with it, this vacuum has more suck power than you can imagine, maybe too much."
1,Metro Vac and Blow,I purchased this vacuum online. It came packed rather flimsy. No book of directions. I flipped the electrical switch and it wouldn't start. I tried four outlets. Obviously this company doesn't even have a quality control otherwise it would have at least turned on. It's a bad product.
1,Wrong model number...............Again!!!,"Had the same experience as another reviewer here. Purchased this model number, but received a different model number.Called Amazon customer service and they shipped me another one. Same problem - the box is labeled with the correct model number, but the model number on the product is different. It's not Amazon's fault, but the company's.I now question the integrity of MetroVac as this seems to NOT be an isolated incident. What an easy way for a company to embarrass itself."
2,"My Son loves this toy, but.....","My son loves this toy. He's usually loses intrest fast in toys but he was so excited to get this toy, but when it arrived the watch part did not work. We thought the battery had died, so we took it to the jewelers to get it replaced with a new one and it still did not work, so I guess the watch it self is just broken. Also, I ordered this for my son because not only could he tell time on it (which he can't any more) but we were excited about showing him how a compass works. I guess I did not read close enough (it is a toy) but the compass is not real and I thought that was kind of chezzy. It would not cost the manufacture much to put A REAL ONE IN. My son was upset that the watch part did not work and hes' the one that bugged us to try to get it fixed. We did not have the heart to tell him the compass was not real, so we just pretend it works :-(. The only part on this toy that works is the secret decoder(oooooohhhh!!)."
1,Interesting toy; but doesn't work well.....,We never could get ours to work very well; not enough investment in it to send back. Just had to throw in the toy box for play without actual use. Really don't recommend at all....
3,Christmas gift,"Ordered this product as a Santa gift to go along with pirate ship, etc. The digital time part did not work. Tried everything and it never did come on. Regardless, my 5yr old loved it."
4,Good office or class mate,"This is a good book to have on hand regarding highlights for the different family therapies out there. The chapters could be sorter and say the same thing, but if you can overlook its wordy-ness it is a good resource."
1,Don't believe the hype.,"Don't believe the hype. This book is a difficult read, not because the content is tough but because the writing is rambling, repetitive, and filled with personal opinions. Goldenberg and Goldenberg's Family Therapy: An Overview is a much stronger book, clearly written and organized, and an investment to keep. I wish I bought that one instead."
3,Great overview!,"This book gives excellent overview of multiple methods of family therapy. I needed it for a class, but I will be keeping it because of it's easy use and my future in family therapy. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested or who will be going into therapy of any kind, family, individual, couples, etc."
4,50% Extra Stories,"I absolutely love the series Girl Got Game (Power!!). In this volume Kyo must come up for an explanation of why Chiharu felt what he felt when he touched her chest. Kyo decides he must act more like a guy and comes up with an idiotic plan to do it. Kyo tries to act like ""one of the guys"", obsessing over girls. Chiharu realizes Kyo is just trying to put up an act and calls him on it. What is poor Kyo going to do?Normally,I would give this series five stars. I, actually, wanted to give it 3.5 stars, but rounded it to four. Half of the graphic novel (and I mean a full half)was extra stories, not even featuring the cast of Girl Got Game. I felt ripped off, like the series was trying to be dragged out in to more volumes so they could sell more. I didn't pay for the short stories, I wanted Girl Got Game. It didn't help that didn't even like the short stories. Oh well. I still like and recommend this series, just be aware of what's in this volume.(It came as a shock to me.) ^_^"
4,^.^,"I just have to say that I really loved this graphic novel!It's the story of a girl who's father wants her to be a basketball player, so she ends up dressing as a boy to be on the boys' team (where all of attention and good players are). It doesn't really focus on basketball, but rather on the relationship between her and her roommate. I really enjoyed it and am trying to find the second one.If it had any faults, it was that it moved just a little too quickly, but it doesn't really detract from the story."
3,Good but...,"..could be better. If youre into this stuff get the Rosenberg trio ""Live at the North Sea Jazz Festival"" Stochelo Rosenberg nails those and its totally live"
3,This is only a supplement to the full 6th ed of 2000.,"The accountant who said this book was useless apparently did not notice that this is only a cumulative supplement and not the full version. This contains only the updated information since the May 2000 publication of the 823-page core volume, ""Financial and Accounting Guide for Not-for-Profit Organizations, Sixth Edition"" (published May 15, 2000; ISBN 0-471-38039-3). The core volume is supplemented yearly. The publisher also offers subscriptions to the updates.If you want the ""full meal deal,"" you need both the core volume and this supplement. That would give you both a complete overview and up-to-date information."
4,"Some Good, Some less good...",Great pieces for the regular six-string but some of the others lack the rich harmonies that a listener such as myself would like to hear from a modern brazillian guitarist.
4,Scary....be afraid,"If I were working the world of high-risk/high-gain, I would always be watching my back. I'm not suspicious by nature, but after reading PRESSURE POINTS, I would never know WHO to trust.The other reviews pretty much explain the plot, but what struck me about the book was the sheer ruthlessness of those willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want.Egads and little fishes...I'm glad I don't live in their world. I'm sure I'd end up at the bottom of this group's food chain.The author has matured a lot since DARKNESS BOUND. I look forward to more stories from him. He's headed for a bright future in the books selling biz!Enjoy!"
4,Super Book,"Larry Brooks does an admirable job of weaving an intricate plot of the corporate world and the political machinations that occur within.Brad, Mark and Pam vie for a corporate takeover of their advertising company. As a condition of the take-over they must attend The Seminar.The book takes us through each character's development and growth experiences. It's a harrowing ride.There are many twists and turns which will keep the reader on the end of their seats.I recommend this book!"
5,"Fun, thrilling, and unexpected","This book is a fun read. The plot has many unexpected twists. Just about the time you think you know what is really happening, another kink is thrown in leaving you wondering again. The ending was fantastic. I would highly recommend this book to someone who wants a fun, fast, and unpredictible read."
4,Comprehensive and impressive.,"I have found this collection of advertising characters indispensable as reference. A brief history of the subject matter is included and reads well. The lack of an index is perplexing, and given the occupations of its authors the cover design should have been a little more proficient. Otherwise it is well worth a look or two or three."
4,First-rate leftovers,"Hard to believe that this double-CD set is made up of recordings that never made it onto other releases. It's pretty difficult to find an ambient album that's pure goodness from start to finish. Woob, FSOL's Lifeforms, some of the em:t samplers, some Eno, Boards of Canada's Geogaddi.... Uhmmm, I think that's about it.Hitori + Kaiso makes the grade, though. A mix of super-ambient and heavier tracks with a haunting sound and sparse melodies, this is almost too good to be true for ambient fans. Not to be missed."
5,One of My Top Ten Books!,"I bought this book when it first came out in the '90s, and still have my tattered, well-leafed copy which has been lent out many times, and been re-read a couple. It remains in my memory for several reasons. One is the insight it gives into Mormon family life, and what it means to be a Mormon. Another is the writing, Orson Scott Card is a very fine writer who draws you into the story from page 1. And another is the plot. I'm not really into horror, but this book is somehow believable, probably because of the matter of fact way it is written. The family who dwelt in this book became my neighbours, and I empathized with them in their plight to the point of tears."
1,Defective for Me,"I tried to use this DVD about a month ago with my kindergarten class because we were studying habitats. No matter what I did the video kept starting somewhere in the middle. I'm not sure if I simply received a defective product, or if my experience is the norm. However, I'm not satisfied."
2,Poor quality cd.,I tried 3 separate cd's no luck with these. I could not play them on my new computer. They just couldn't get past the opening page. I was very disappointed for my students.
2,compassionate but harmful,"While this book takes a compasionate view of homosexuality itis harmful in the fact that it maintains that anyone, if they haveenough faith and determination, can change. Park is quick to point out that the evidence supporting the ""born that way"" theory are not conclucive but fails to mention the same thing about his own theories. The author himself says, ""I personally attest that it is possible to diminish homosexual attractions"". Diminishing homosexual attractions is not the same as changing them to heterosexual ones. People who read this book should do so with a grain of salt. END"
5,crochet hooks,Love these. Bought a set for my friend who is constantly crocheting and gave them to her. She said they were the best hooks she ever used. Smooth and no little burrs on needles.
3,Definitely not for everyday use,"I have been crocheting for 23 years and for the most part I have used steel hooks. Unfortunately I do travel quite a bit and I needed hooks to take on the plane, these were the obvious choice. The first thing that I have noticed is there the plastic tends to have an edge. It's easily filed down with a fingernail file, but it's there none the less. It's not overly comfortable to use and the smaller hooks (Primarily G) aren't that firm with rough usage. I tend to make crochet toys and amigurumi which requires a nice tight stitch, and these just don't cut it. I could never get the stitches tight enough without fear of breaking the hook.Now, that being said. These would be GREAT for kids who are just learning to crochet. They have bright and attractive colors that can definitely keep ones interest while trying to teach them something that can be tedious otherwise :) They are also relatively inexpensive compared to steel hook kits."
3,Split ur yarn,"I got these because they're plastic and therefore I can crochet during flights. They're ok but there are two things that bother me: the flat part where u hold it is too close to the hook part, and the very edge of the hook is so sharp, so it catches on ur yarn and splits it more often than other needles. Get these if u need them for a small task, but if ur getting these as ur main crochet hooks, I would recommend getting the metal ones."
3,Delicate,"These are light weight, but they are delicate. I think all of mine have snapped in half. I would go for the aluminum hooks any day."
5,A delightful collection of poems!,"I knew the author when we both lived in the same city (and same apartment complex) while starting out in our careers, and resumed e-mail contact with her last year. I'm glad that this book is still available; I own an autographed first edition. It hits home with men as well as with women, and the poems deal with the vicissitudes of life and love for singles. It is as timely today as it was when it was first published in 1975. Fortunately for Marilyn, she eventually married and now has a teenage son, and still writes."
4,Pretty Good.,For it's minor budget Lamp Post Lane is a pretty good film. It may be shorter than the average feature but the story is interesting and it does a good job of keeping the audience's attention. Defiantly worth $10.
4,Good value,"We're very pleased with the product. It's quiet, sturdy and serves our needs perfectly. Plastic knobs referred to in an earlier review are more than adequate if they are not abused; has nothing to do with the metal construction. Good value for the money."
2,Waist the money,"spend the extra money and buy a full functional unit. It's good to be used as a jack stand, not a tune up stand!"
3,Petsafe Heated dog Bed-Medium,"Ordered this bed after reviewing several brands. The dog bed arrived when expected, but we ended up returning it. We have a big lab-mix indoor dog and we found the medium -sized bed too small. Although the bed seemed well-made, with a nice thick pad that was quite soft and comfortable, the heating element in the pad seemed to generate very little, if any heat. The mild vibrating function of the bed appeared to work well. I tried to order the next size up on the same bed, but at the time it was not available and I noticed was considerably higher in price when it would be available. If your dog is over 70 lbs I would suggest the large size, hopefully the bigger size has a heating pad that generates more heat."
4,pretty good dog bed,"the bed is good quality & a nice size. my only complaint would be that you can feel the heating unit in the middle & the heat does not radiate through the entire bed/cushion. with a blanket over it, it gets pretty warm after a while. the vibrate feature is louder than i thought. that said, my dog likes the bed, i think the extra warmth from the heater is nice in the winter, it's a perfect size for the intended space, and it is well made. the cord is nice & long."
4,Great pet bed,"Works great, however it wasn't easy to get my dog to use it, vibration scares him so we don't use that feature. The heater plug sometimes pulls out... but otherwise a great product. Good for indoors, doesn't get too hot."
4,Pet Bed,I have to say that I would recommend this product for anyone with a pet. My dog loves it and sleeps on it all the time.
1,all that glitters is not gold,"they look fabulous, but when it comes to real work they are not work even $5. very disappointed by the purchase. I do not recommend."
2,Great picture- but annoying whine made me return,"I bought this set in June '07- about a month after it was released. Unfortunately, I am returning it to Amazon and have bought something else.This set has a big, beautiful picture. It also has an annoying whine- coming from the back- which I think is the color wheel spinning. I didn't notice this in a store because of other noise- but at home- I couldn't help but notice. To me, it was irritating and distracting.I already have a Samsung DLP, also with color wheel, but I don't notice any whine from it at all. Nor from others I'd looked at.I checked, and other buyers have reported the same thing on AVSForums-- one of which had a Mits service person state the noise was normal for this set. I'd also gone back to Best Buy- and sure enough- their display did the same thing.I am very particular about noises like this- so if you are too at least listen to this before buying. I wish I could have kept it... but alas..."
1,Update: DLP has parts that break,"Too bad some people are having noise issues with this TV. Mine doesn't make any sounds louder than one would expect, and it's certainly not so loud that it can be heard while watching anything. For a 65"" TV at this price point, you really can't do better.UPDATE: After 2 years the color wheel broke, and Mitsubishi does not offer the color wheel as a separate replacable part. It was going to cost us over $1000 for a new optic unit and another $900+ to get someone out to replace it. DLP is outdated tech. Get a flatscreen instead. That's what we're doing."
1,Good Image--Horrible buzzing,"This TV is great except for the most annoying buzzing sound. I have searched online and found numerous other people complaining about this sound as well.I can hear it from over 40 feet away in other rooms in my house. It is impossible to watch TV with this sound, even at mid range volume. What a bummer. Do not buy this TV, the buzz will drive you mad. I am trading mine in for a Samsung DLP LED projection."
2,Disappointed,"TV was delivered damaged. Amazon and Eagle delivery were great in taking the product back and refunding my money fast. However, this was a blessing in disguise as I ended up purchasing the Samsung HLT-6187 and wow!!! So do yourself a favor and spend the extra couple of hundred bucks for the Samsung (no color wheel to burn out!)"
3,peds heme/onc,"The book is a good one, however my copy arrived missing part of the table of contents, the first page and some pages of the appendix."
3,Unrealistic Corporate World,"I had mixed feelings while reading this novel. On the one hand, Stephen Frey spins an exciting corporate tale, chock-full of intrigue, plot twists, and surprises. On the other hand, the corporate atmosphere described by Frey is too byzantine and over-the-top to be taken seriously. The private equity world that the author depicts is an ultra-competitive realm of capitalistic extremes populated by murderers, espionage, constant double-crossing, never-ending back stabbings, and sexual excesses. In terms of extreme behavior, Frey's corporate world would put Caligula's court to shame. It is simply too much! Even though we live in a world where corporate shenanigans do occur (i.e. Enron and Worldcom), Frey's storyline is too much to stomach."
5,Frey keeps getting better,"Stephen Frey delights again with his latest---this is an excellent read. I echo the sentiments of the other reviewers; Frey does an excellent job building suspense, weaving the fasinating goings-on of the world of high finance into his story, and keeping the plot twists coming at a faster and faster rate as the story unfolds. I've been a fan of all of Frey's books to date, and though I had previously felt his first book (The Takeover) was his best, in my opinion The Chairman has now taken the top spot. A wonderful read---highly recommended."
1,horrible,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. At one point the author clumsily explains what a Blackberry is. There is also an explosion in a public place and no one waits for the police (I have no idea if they investigate, I quit reading before that). This is one of the few books I didn't even try to finish."
4,Frey is back,I've read all of Frey's books and his early ones were great I loved them then he started to go down hill because he did more one suspence and did not do very much banking stuff which is what I read his books for. He went back to that this time. BTW all of the Rep. (encluding me) who were a little upset that the REPs took a lot of heat in his books will be happy that DEMS are taking some in this book.
4,4 1/2 stars,"I think this is one of Frey's best. I thought it was well written and the storyline definitely intrigued me. You'll get a good idea of how business works from the top.From inside: ""Allies. As vital in business as in war. Because business is war.""Highly recommended."
3,Not Too Deep,Good light reading. Some good surprises and not a lot of dropped material. His inner battles are presented in a somewhat melodramatic way.
4,Excellent writing and keeps you trapped in the story,Keeps you hooked into the story guessing to the end.. great writer. I am into the series now!Be prepared to get more.
3,a quick read,"This book was a quick and fun read. Its fascinating plot was marred by the TOO neat conclusion - everything was explained at the end by means of a conversation between two characters. Other than that, I looked forward to reading a bit here and there whenever I had a chance. I was definitely hooked by the character of Christian Gillette (although a bit put off that he was only 36!)"
1,The Worst Novel I Have Read in a Long Time - Awful!!!,"Stephen Frey wasn't always this bad, but he surely is now. There is nothing redeeming about this illogical, poorly written, badly concieved piece of trash. There is nothing more to say about it."
4,Refreshing Sun Tea,"Excellent tea when using the sun. Hard to get the brewing temperature right, green and black brewing best at different temps, but as a sun tea it excels. Wonderful flavors, subtle and yet bold. Brew 4 bags per quart, let it sit for about an hour. You won't be sorry.Love Tazo blends. They do it well."
5,good tea,"It is hard to find decafinated tea without foo foo flower flavoring. This has only a very MILD flower flavor, and is the closest to real tea flavor that I have found in this brand line that is still decafinated."
5,Bombay in a Box,"A hot summer afternoon, a Bollywood number belting out of a rusty boombox and a cup of Tazo Organic Chai. Its the perfect recipe to transport you to the streets of Bombay.This tea hits the spot. Its bold and spicy and yet has that distinctive black tea kick. The ginger, cardamom and cloves remind me of the traditional Indian chaiwallah flavor. For those who aren't accustomed to spiced teas, I recommend adding equal parts of milk and two small helpings of your favorite sweetener. When the flavor grows on you... and it will :), you may reduce the milk and experience the richness of the masalas.I have tasted other black teas but this one stands out. It truly is food for the soul. Highly recommended."
1,"Missing the ""Muscatel"" flavour from the second flush Darjeeling Tea","I had earlier purchased the same pack from ""Whole Foods"" and it was awesome. Hence I decided to save money by purchasing online. I was surprised when I missed the ""muscatel"" flavour from the second flush Darjeeling Tea. I STRONGLY suggest to purchase this tea from your nearest grocery store instead of purchasing online."
5,Tea Delicious and delivered on time and in great shape(NT),"This Tazo OM Tea is delicious. I use it in the morning instead of coffee. This is how I prepare my large morning mug of tea. I heat water in my electric kettle, meanwhile I place a Tazo OM teabag, and a single serving bag of ""regular"" black tea in my mug, along with a pkt of Stevia, maybe with an additional teaspoon of Stevia because it is a big mug. After the kettle clicks off because it has boiled, I pour the boiling water over the tea bags, etc, placing one finger over the Tazo teabag STRING draped over the edge of the mug, so the string is not so likely to end up in the mug. Let steep for 3-5 minutes, squeeze out the teabags(I use a teabag squeezer I got at the English Tea Store online), then add my non-fat half-n-half. I enjoy this more than coffee, no sour aftertaste, and MUCH gentler on my system than coffee! TMI! Have a great day!"
5,My Favorite,Great tea. They used to sell at starbucks but no longer have it. I drink this tea all the time.
5,Best tasting tea!,"I love this tea! I don't drink coffee and I find a lot of herbal teas just aren't flavorful enough for me. This tea is wonderful, and I find if I'm craving something sweet, it helps to hit the spot. It smells wonderful and kind of reminds me of Kool-Aid, actually! I didn't realize how much I loved it until I ran out recently! I like to have it with a bit of sugar. Yum!"
2,NOT the same as picture,I LOVE tea...it's my drink! BUT the price gets a bit steep so I thought I'd try to make it myself at home. I was so excited to find this concentrate to be able to do so as I tried with tea bags and online how to searches and it wasn't the same. This is soooo NOT the same. I'm very disappointed.
4,Amazing product,This product is phenomenal. I don't even drink coffee/espresso and longer. My problem is that when I run low on this product; I try to at least have 4-5 on hand before restocking. I go back to shop online to restock.
5,Tantalizing & Refreshing,"My first taste of TAZO Passion Herbal tea had me mentally saying, ""Wow."" The flavor tantalizing and refreshing; and maybe becaused I stopped a moment to enjoy the flavor the stress of another busy day melted away. Each time I have a cup of TAZO's Passion Herbal tea it is as great as the first time. If you enjoy tea, you should try this one."
1,Undrinkable,"When I leaned down to breathe in the (expected) delicate aroma of my first (and last) cup steeping, I was taken aback by the smell. I've gotten a whiff of something similar once or twice before...couldn't put my finger on it but it reminded me of cat urine, or spoiled milk in a closed car on a hot summer day. I can't even give this stuff away - my coworkers, who usually scarf up anything free in the kitchen, turned their noses up at this too. Like another reviewer, I wonder if I received a bad batch. I was very disappointed."
2,Cheap version of what you get from Startbucks,"Powder like chopped tea in a bag.It's cheap, you get a lot, but the tea is the lowest quality one.Even the box looks exactly the same as Starbucks', but those sold in Starbucks are full tea leave and taste better (and more expensive).I should have know this before I buy it, now I have 6 boxes of them I don't know what to do :("
4,The Tea that grew on me,"I tried this tea for the first time months ago, for medicinal purposes, and I didn't really like the taste. It isn't very ginger-y, and initially I didn't sweeten it, as I normally don't sweeten tea or coffee. Then I began using raw honey in it, and drink it with breakfast every morning - 1 cup, steeped about 4 minutes. I really like it now, and haven't found anything else that I would want to have with breakfast to enhance my health. I don't give it 5 stars because on its own, without the honey, it is not impressive."
5,This is my favorite herbal tea!,"Because this is my favorite herbal tea, it was nice to be able to buy six at a time and pay less. It was what is known as a ""no-brainer""."
4,Too spicy,"If you like your chai to be more spicier, thern this is the one for you. It is good but I prefer Twinnings Chai."
4,Price is terrible,"The tea is great. This price is terrible. Even on a bad day, you can get this for $4 per box in any grocery store."
1,Very disappointing,"This tea was not what I expected. I love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product. The tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which I enjoy. This tea has a stronger Rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor. Furthermore, I found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea's ingredients.The ingredients listed on the box include: Cinnamon, Licorice Root, Orange Peel, Indian Sarsaparilla, Chicory Root, Rooibos, Natural Flavors, Star Anise, Almond Extract and Locorice Extract"
4,Tasty fragrant tea!,I got my first cup of this wild sweet orange tea in a cute coffee shop and then fell in love with its great aroma and tasty flavors. Then I found it at a high price (~$6/box) sold in single boxes at Starbucks. Naturally the next thing for me to do was to check on Amazon and found that if I buy them in big package (6 boxes) I can get this delicious tea at <$5/box. So I bought a big pack and had been enjoying it till I grew a little tired of the flavor... I'm sure that after a little break away from it I will continue to enjoy my sweet orange tea time again! Or maybe next time I should buy the variety pack :)
5,tea from tazo,love any tean this brand and so do my seven daughters thank u for offering such a varity of flavors
3,What's happened to the taste?,"I've been drinking this tea for years but what I have bought in the last few months tastes as if cinnamon has been added to it, or some such flavoring. I find it undrinkable now."
1,This is not the exact one like at Starbucks,"First, this is a good tea, but it is not the exact one like at Starbucks. The one at Starbucks is different kind of teabag that has a silk like bag. It's leaves are different too. They are more fuller and these are more ground. Now I realize why the tin box (Tazo Zen Green Tea) at Starbucks could be twice as expensive as this (the tin box has 15 bags for $8.00 at Starbucks). If you want the rich experience of the Zen Green Tea, buy the tin box from Starbucks. And of course, 'You get what you Pay'!"
1,the worst tea ever,"i'm not a stranger to herbal teas, so i do know what i'm talking about. this tea claims to have a variety of herbs NONE of which can be tasted. it's also chamomile based but i've never had chamomile of such low quality, i didn't know chamomile could taste so horribly badly.first off, in order to get any taste of tea in your cup you need to use at least 3 bags. second, when you do achieve some sort of taste - which is still very faint, even with 3 bags - you will be disgusted at the quality of it. my guess is that it's made from the lowest oldest most defective refuses of herbs they could get their hands on. i've never tried it at starbucks but teas sold there are different and much better quality. i bought this tea at a grocery store and unlike other tazo teas it's undrinkable."
2,Unusual taste (in a bad way),"As an Asian Amercian, I am very custom to ginger taste, but will charaterize this tea as a herbal medicine which I hate it."
3,Good Tea but like Bromley Estate Tea better!,This tea is OK. I like Bromley's Estate Tea much better and it is significantly cheaper. I like really strong black tea and to me Bromley is stronger and a 100 bag box is $4 in my supermarket. I was hoping for the $$$ this tea would be better - but I'm going back to Bromley!
3,TOO strong black tea for my taste,"I'm a black tea lover, I usually brew leaf teas. I like Darjeeling and Ceylon teas and I'm not much of an Assam fan, but can like it in moderation. That said, I don't understand the fascination with Tazo teas. I've tried some of their bagged green teas and they were too flavored and one could hardly taste the ""green"" part of the tea. This black tea on the other hand is so strong that if properly brewed it completely kills my taste buds. Sometimes one wants bagged teas to quickly make oneself a cup, but not at such taste disadvantage. I ended up babysitting these tea bags and pulling them out early, but it's not quite it and the convenience factor is out of the window. This tea is understandably still an upgrade on Lipton and Tetley bagged black teas."
5,Life Changing.,"I have always suspected there was a Tazo flavor out there that would be my ultimate favorite, but was never in the stores I frequented. This one is not in the variety pack or at any store near me. I randomly came upon it at a hospitality tea and coffee table at a Disney resort, and fell in love. It's delicioiusly fresh tasting and subtle. Antioxidants and Caffeine; you can't go wrong. Six boxes won't last long at my house. My favorite tea."
5,Great Starbucks tea!,"I had stopped by Starbucks one time on the road and got a hot tea, I got Earl Grey. It was so good I had to have it at home as my regular tea. They used to sell it at the grocery stores, but now this is the only place I can find it!ORDER this and you will have a great supply of great tea! Each bag is individually wrapped so they stay fresh even after you open the box. And the packets are easy to take with you when you are on the go!"
2,TOO EXPENSIVE,"Personally, I love this passion tea and drink a couple of cups a day so I go through a lot of tea. I started looking around to find a more affordable source of the tea and thought Amazon would be just the place. Not true!I can get the same box of tea, 20 count, for under $4.00 a box where this is about $6.00 a box. Not a good deal!"
2,Not so much,"I much prefer other brands. This one seemed bitter no matter how I brewed it. Judging by the other reviews I may have a different taste in Chai than most, or maybe I just got a bad box of tea."
4,"Love the Tea, although what arrived was caffeinated","The tea arrived quick and in perfect condition.I ordered decaf, but caffeinated arrived. I still love the tea, and it's hard to find in grocery stores. So rather than return it, I'll just limit drinking it to AM hours."
2,"Despite the reviews here, I think most people would agree with me.","Wow, very weird taste. I typically like all the ingredients, but this mix just tastes wrong. It's somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea, but with a licorice aftertaste. It isn't so bad that I couldn't finish the first cup, but not my cup of tea."
1,Way too strong,Even if you only leave the bag in for a few seconds the flavor is overpowering. I like cup of herbal tea at night enjoying everything from Chamomeille to Peach. I gave it away.
5,zen,great for making iced green tea. same stuff they use at starbucks and the price of one box is about the same as they charge for a large drink!
5,Superb! Have drank it for 6 years,Im a big green tea buff. However i need a little something stronger in the morning. This tea is just it. It has merely a hint of black tea to add a umph more caffeine. In addition its all organic and has the subtle flavorings of peach and cucumber. Highly recommend!
5,Love this tea,"I never drank tea or coffee for my first 51 years and then I got melanoma. My sister, an acupuncturist, said that green tea was great for keeping cancer cells away so I started drinking it everyday. I love Tazo's Green Ginger tea, it's very soothing and delicious."
1,"Old-fashioned, outdated and misleading","This book is clearly outdated, therefore it should not be recommended to anybody who would pursue a career in Particle Physics. In dealing with renormalization, the authors did not even mention the phrase ""Effective Field Theory"". When introducing chiral symmetry of the strong interaction in Chapter 5, it is surprising that the authors did not even have a section about Chiral Perturbation Theory, while sticking to Current Algebra. There is nothing about Heavy Quark Symmetry in this book... And the treatment of mass and wavefunction renormalization in Section 2.3 is at best misleading...In short, this is one of the least books one should pick to learn either Quantum Field Theory or modern Particle Physics."
3,Poor Binding,"I have no issues with the contents: you should know QFT at the level of Weinberg Vol 1 and group theory at the level of Tung. If it were not for the construction of this book I would probably have rated it 5 stars. The cover and binding are what you would expect from a cheap five-dollar paperback. I wasn't reading it much longer than two ot three weeks before sections started to fall out. At the price its being sold, its poor quality is nothing but a crime."
4,gauge theory of elementary particle physics,since field theory is not setisfectory in any sense the book seems to present it not as ugly.
4,Like watching a Shimmering stream of water,"This disc is not easy to digest. It should be listened few times before deciding if liking it or not. and why its like watching shimmering stream of water ? Because, every time i listened to it i found glimpses of beauty in another song or another part of the song and the opposite."
2,micro-type,"the type used in this intriguing, much awaited book is so small that reading it is truly discouraging. why, why why???? ruin such an effort!"
1,Don't waste your lucky penny on this book,"Although witty and amusing, this book fails to accomplish the purpose of its subtitle: ""Understanding Language and Culture through Superstitions."" Half of these superstitions I have never even heard of so I'm not sure how they help other to better understand the English language and American culture.Furthermore, some of the ""superstitions"" are actually English idioms rather than superstitious activities such as getting out of bed on the wrong side which is also included in 101 American English Idioms. Still others are examples of cultural ""wisdom sayings.""This book is perhaps the weakest in its series in terms of providing help with the American culture and language."
5,New School Meets Old School,"If you want to use an RPM-detecting device like I did when I installed thePIONEER AVGVDP1 Vehicle Dynamics Processor, this is what you need to get the RPM signal from today's electronic ignition systems to properly be ""seen"" by various RPM-detecting units like old tachometers, shift lights and even some new fangled devices like the AVG-VDP1 I bought.Installation is super-easy and instructions are included. Basically the unit (very small) is clipped to a coil input wire, three wires from the unit are attached to the car (12-volt input, ground, and 12-volt output) with your old-school RPM-driven device using the 12-volt output. It is made to work with most current electronic ignition systems including diesel systems.Until I found this unit, I was unable to use my AVG-VDP1, so this was a real life-saver!"
1,Used and non-functional,"I'm not sure if this product is any good. The ""new"" one I received had writing all over the technical document. It would not produce the 12V output as indicated. I belevie it was broken when I received it. It was clearly returned from someone else who installed it, probably fried it and then sent it back. There is no way this product could be returned in new condition after it is found to be defective. It didn't work, and now it can't be returned. I wouldn't recommend Amazon for this product."
4,Useful facts about lesser-known places,"This informative volume describes a number of towns that would otherwise surely go unnoticed by the non-Southerner. Basic population, economic and climate data are followed by descriptive sections on recreation, housing, health resources, and the like. An occasional anecdote or personal interview might have added a bit of color, but this is a more complete book than most others about those charming, artistic, or undiscovered places we want to find out about, and it may be the only one of its kind on the South. I am happy to own it."
5,AMAZING!,This book was really just wonderful in every way. I dont usually like books like this but really this book kept me on the edge of my seat until i finished reading it. Wow. Just wow
3,"Great service by provider/distributor, lackluster performance by manufacturer","we got the yo yo in plenty of time! undamaged, packaged adequately and exactly what we ordered!However, the first time the string jumped his fingers and the yo yo hit the floor, it cracked and broke. We were able to salvage the bearing for the next yo you.. the mosquito however is unusable. We will be shopping a different brand from now on.Thank you for the great shopping experience though!"
2,Duncan Mosquito Yo-Yo,"Don't waste your money on this yo-yo. It is poorly made and is very difficult to rewind the string especially for a child. Also, I saw the yo-yo at Walmart for $6 and I paid $9 on Amazon including postage. At least I could have returned this yo-yo to Walmart."
3,Duncan Mosquito,"When I oredered this yo-yo, i expected it to be very good. Although I was still pleased with my purchase, I was disapointed with this yo-yo's sleep time. At best I can only get 10 seconds, usually only 8. This makes it hard to do the simplest of string tricks, like ""rock the baby"", let alone more challenging ones, like ""atom bomb"". Still, it is a good yo-yo. I love its smooth though sharp resonse. I suggest this yo-yo, but if you want long sleep times, try the Fast 201. However, the fast is a bad yo-yo for a begginer, because its high response will destroy your potential of tricks on lower response yo-yos, but the Mosquito is a perfect yo-yo for someone just starting out that doesn't need excellent perforamance."
3,Vanity Light,"I do like the looks of this light fixture, but have one problem. My handyman had already installed the light before I noticed a small hole in one part of the metal. I should have returned it, but since it was already installed I decided to keep it. The hole is quite small, but noticeable."
4,Nice looking but should include the screws and connectors.,"I really like the wavy design of that light, it fits well in the bathroom.But for the price I would maybe expect a thicker metal, and most certainly to have included the two #8/32 screws to fix the plate to the wall, and two electric connectors."
2,Better to be seen than heard,"I bought this video for my ESL class, but I am very disappointed with it. The rhythm is not steady, and many of the songs are sung by someone who sounds off-key. The visuals, however, are very good. If this could be remade with a different sound track, ... Unfortunately I cannot return it because I opened the package. I am one of those teachers who spends way too much of their own money on classroom supplies, and right now I am especially regretting it."
1,Painful to listen to,"I am a Literacy Coordinator for a program that serves adult ESL and reading learners. I rely on the reviews at amazon.com to assist me in making good purchasing decisions. Unfortunately, I must have been in a hurry when I bought this video because I didn't read the April 3, 2004 review until I came to write my own. I was so surprised that it contained everything that I wanted to say. I've decided to go ahead and add my review because the two existing ones seem to give readers conflicting opinions.All the singers in this video are off key (even children would notice) and are often out of sinc with the music. The music is not only rhythmically unsteady but also too fast and sometimes too loud for the singing (which makes it difficult to focus on the words). Listeners will not be entertained or educated but will instead be put on edge."
5,"So far, so good",Great little cover for my Garmin 201 provides an extra level of security against the elements and from losing it from my mountain bike handlebars in bumpy sections like I lost my last one.You can velcro it to your handlebars and then hook it w/a small lanyard to a brake or shifter cable in case the velcro lets go.You can also use it to hook it to Camelbak while hiking to keep it up and out of your way while still giving it a good view of the sky.
3,Great toy - but broke after 3 months use,"My son absolutely loves the ducks. He will sit and pull the string to hear the tune and see them waddle along, or I can pull the ducks around the house and he will chase after them, giggling like crazy. Sadly, the sound broke on it two days ago, and now it's silent. I'm really disappointed that the toy broke so fast, as is my son. Perhaps I was unlucky, and just got a bad unit. I hope so, because its a fun and endearing toy."
5,Couldn't wait to get it out of the box,"My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday. There she sat surrounded by toys and this was the one she couldn't wait to play with. A few months later she still likes to drag it around. The ducks are adorable to watch ""waddle"" and the little song is so cute (I occassionally cathc myself or my husband singing it later in the day)."
3,High durability is a *bad* thing here!,"This is a cute toy -- the FIRST hundred times you hear it. With each successive LOUD repeat, though, you will find your sanity slipping away. Do toy manufacturers think we're all hard-of-hearing?A child might give the fun rating here 4 stars but an adult would probably give it 2. I think the suggestion of putting tape over the speaker area is a good one.It really is cute .... but be prepared to have ""quack quack, quack quack, quack quack quack quack, quack quack, quack quack, quack QUACK QUACK"" running through your head at the oddest moments."
3,Toxic or Non-toxic?,"My daughter received this toy as a gift when she was about one year old. She enjoyed pulling the string and hearing the ""quacks"". However she was at the age (still is) where almost all toys go in her mouth. Right after she was playing with it I noticed a little orange on her cheek. I looked at the toy and sure enough some of the paint had chipped off. I immediately gave it back to the gift giver and she returned it! Any toy that has particles that come off when chewed are in my opinion, not safe...non toxic or not (and this toy box did NOT say, non-toxic)."
4,Love the ducks!,"We bought the toy because it reminded us of pull toys from our youth. The electronic ""quack"" is cute, but loud. Like many of my daughter's electronic toys, I put a piece of clear plastic packing tape over the speaker to lower the volume. It helps a lot!"
2,"Cute, but not what it's quacked up to be.","This toy seems to thrill parents more than children. The sound effects are adorable (although not so cute when the quacking tune gets stuck in your head), but the ducks fall over so easily the kids lose interest almost immediately. You'd be better off buying a different pull along toy. (Check out the puppy dogs.)"
1,Tomy quality is NOT here!,I gave this toy to my youngest grandchild for Christmas and the wheels do not turn well but just slide on the floor...the rubber pieces between the ducks seem to be warped...very disappointing!
2,Quack along ducks fizzled out,"My family rented a vacation house and there happened to be one of these toys at the house. My Daughter fell in love with it. When you pull the string to walk the ducks it quacks. She loved it so much that I contacted to rental company, they put me in touch with the family who owns the house so I could track one down. She said that it had been around for 10 years or more. Wow, this thing is durable, I thought. I ordered one in September, got it early October and it no longer works. It worked for 2 months. Dont waste your money on this Chinese made piece of crap!"
3,Battery replacement is a nightmare!,"This toy isn't very educational, but it is cute.Replacing the battery (it's a watch battery) is NOT fun."
3,cute at first..,"I got the toy as a hand-me-down from my 5 years old nephew who still likes to play with this ducks. my daughter is 9 months now and she doesn't really know how to play with it; and she believes that she'd rather bite the wheels. I usually tie the ducks to her walker and she would run around with the ducks dragged =) while trying to reach them (dunno what she wants to do with it though).it's cute at first, but when you hear it quacking all day long, it starts to get a little annoying. it's proven durable though, my nephew got it when he was just 6 months old and now he's 5!"
4,"Quack, Quack , Waddle,Waddle","This is a cute pull-along toy with a sweet little tune. When your child pulls on the cord, a little tune plays that sounds like quack, quack, waddle, waddle."
3,No off switch!,"Yes, it's a cute toy - at least for the first minute. There is no off switch, no volume control, and no way to remove the battery. The quacking is LOUD and annoying after a bit."
4,Battery issues but solved - otherwise great toy,"I write this review for those who like their toys to last and are hesitant to buy this because of the battery issue. The company makes the claim that the batteries in this are not replaceable. Ours lasted two months before the batteries died, and I figured since there are screws to take it apart then we could figure out how to replace the batteries.When we opened it up there were wires and an enclosure for the batteries. It takes 3 AG13 size batteries. Long story short, there are a lot of screws and wires to deal with, but the good news is we did replace the batteries and it now works as good as new. It may be a pain in the duck butt but know that it's not impossible, so you might feel a little better about ordering this after reading my review."
2,Cheap! :(,"This came from a 3rd part vendor. NOT Amazon. Its waaaay cheap. Like you bought it at Flea Market. Didn't fit my dog at all! Maybe for a toy dog?? It was so flimsy I felt like it was for my daughters stuffed animals, not a live one! Returned it...no good."
2,Very Small!!!,"Smaller than it looks in picture. Unless you have tiny dog, do not purchase! You will have to return like I did!"
4,Handy gray card,"I leave these convenient gray cards attached to my photo bag so I'll always have one with me. They're handy to include in any scene with complicated mixes of lighting or where you might be unsure what the right white balance should be. In the ""good old days"", this made color printing much easier, and with today's digital systems, post-processing adjustments are really simple - just adjust the color balance in whatever photo editing software you use so that the gray is a correct midtone neutral.The construction is good - a fairly rugged plastic that seems like it will stand up to lots of use. I personally don't have a lot of use for the white and black cards, but the gray alone is worth the price.Recommended."
4,Good for the price,Have not used these enough to give a final thought. The times I have they work great. Plus the photo stores want a lot more money for the same thing.
2,Not Accurate,"Digital Image Flow DGK Color Tools, Standard White Balance Card Set with Standard Lanyard (Set of Three Cards)My biggest disappointment was the gray card. I expected an 18% (or ""middle"") gray but what I received was much lighter. When I attempted to color balance an image in post-production by clicking on the gray card the image was far from accurate. Also, the black card was hardly black enough. Clicking on it will rendered most of my darks a deep black. Too contrasty for me. Finally, when I received the product the lanyard was NOT attached. I had to take the time before the shoot to figure out how to thread the darn thing. My recommendation is don't waste your money on this fancy product unless you intend to shoot in the rain where the plastic will be a benefit. Otherwise, just buy a simple 18% gray card (which I also had on the shoot and saved my ""bacon!"")"
5,"Compact, has what you need, shipped fast.","One black, one white, one 18% gray. All three are about the size of a credit card. Comes with a neckstrap. I'm not sure how this product could be improved. The set is perfect for setting white balance and exposure with one test shot, and small enough that it isn't a major request to ask your subject to hold it up while you take a shot.The ""user's guide"" actually had some helpful tips. Like walk through your venue prior to a shoot and take quick test shots with the cards in frame as you walk through the different lighting conditions of the various areas you intend to shoot in. This way you get your WB test shots out of the way early and the files are all right next to each other on your memory card, easily organized. This would be ideal for weddings, for example.The shipping was really fast! I placed my order on Sunday, got it today (Thursday)."
3,"Flat Color, just ok","My hair is mostly gray, but started out black. I've been dying my hair for a decade in salons and at home. I've used every conceivable brand and decided to try this more ""natural"" brand. First of all, it still has the dreaded ppd, which is the bad chemical in hair dye. So, if you are allergic, this product won't help. On the plus side, It doesn't smell strongly and is easy to apply. My gray was completely covered, and remained so (even 4 weeks later). However, my hair was all one flat color of black. I echo the other reviewer in saying that the color was extremely hard to remove. I had tinted lather in my shampoo for days afterward. My hair was also more fuzzy and coarse than with other box colors.Wanted to like it, but can't. It's a poor cousin to the more expensive mass market colors. Flat color, more damaged hair and the same dangerous chemical. Oh, and it costs more. Not worth it."
1,Fractions & Decimals Grade 6-8,The book had writing with ink pen in it and I cannot use several of the pages.Teacher
2,Lack-lustre Batucada Action,I found this a disappointing box of tricks. Didn't really work for me. It's stylistically all over the show with few standout tracks. The highlights were Walter Wanderley and Nicola Conte for their tutti-fruttiness. A whole album of that would be a dream but with Batucada flicking around through genres and decades leaves the album lacking in an overall feel. And spare us that Sergio Mendez: makes me feel ill!

1,Wrong picture for this item,"The picture doesn't belongs to Bolle Fusion Habu.I received yesterday and i'm actually very dissapointed, because this was not the model that i wanted."
1,Title is a Misprint,"The title is a misnomer. This is not a guide to winning at Keno. It rather tells of the history of the game, relates the adventures of the author and gives just a brief explanation on how to play the game. I definitely do not recommend this book. It's a waste of your money."
2,Blah ....Blah...Blah,"I bought this book a while back , mainly to be a companionto Paul's earlier book. Ok it was thicker and newer. And I wasdisappointed. the older version written by Paul Bragg is much better. It gets right to the point and Paul tells of his own fasting stories and those of others. Bottom line is the older,smaller and maybe cheaper version is much better. It may be had to find However."
4,Great Book On Fasting,If you are looking for a book to give you the health benefits of fasting I highly recommend this book. This book also had a easy to follow style and short sections if you can't read for a long stretch at a time.
4,Good book,"If you are using their products this book will explain all the benefits and how to use them properly. It also is an excellent primer on the benfits of fasting and ""clean"" living."
5,A GREAT READ FOR DE-TOXING!,"I loved this book, it was information that was easily presented and sites a lot of accurate facts regarding the relationship between food and health. It is a wonderful book for anyone that is new to ""fasting"" . It goes into a great depth of understanding the fasting process and why it is so beneficial to people."
1,Unsubstantiated Opinions,"If you're interested in fasting and want information on how to do it and what to expect, this book is useless. I'm glad I also ordered Dr. Fuhruman's book ""Fasting and Eating for Health"" which is excellent. Bragg's book is entirely opinion with no substantiation and little to no explanation. Read the book's cover and there's no need to go further -- the remainder of the book finds 100 ways to repeat what the cover summarizes."
2,Alot of Fluff,"This book has some good information in it, but it is mostly fluff, filler and repetition. Each time I sit down to read it, I fall asleep because there is so much filler. The book could easily be reduced to a pamphlet-sized book without any sacrifice of information. I like to know how and why, and I don't mind reading on and on if the how and why is explained. I even enjoyed the China Study, which has a lot of explanatory text to support statements. Most people would call the China Study a dry read, but every word has a purpose. The Miracle of Fasting is mostly just empty words with statements only weakly backed up by the author's personal observations, not science. I think there are some useful tidbits in this book, but I would suggest you borrow this book from a friend or the library if you can. I am hoping to find a more comprehensive book on the subject of fasting. Any suggestions?"
2,Only a little helpful & keeps repeating over & over,"This book could have been much shorter since it keeps repeating the same messages over & over. Because I had some exciting health benefits recently (sinuses, Restless Leg Syndrome & headaches) from my first fast (23 days on only water), this was the 4th book I've read on fasting (want to know more!). The authors recommend fasting 1 day per week (drinking only distilled water) in addition to fasting 7-10 days four times per year. They speak from personal experience & observations but present no hard data or scientific research. Frequent exaggerated claims that fasting makes you ""ageless"" was a turn off as well as a photo of a supposedly 106 year old man lifting weights. He looked 50 and only got a sentence of description under his photo despite being super human and appearing in a very wordy book. The best fasting book I've read so far is ""Fasting and Eating for Health"" by Joel Furhman MD."
5,Excellent advice for living healthy!!,"I am truly thankful for the information presented in The Miracle of Fasting. I had an ulcerated leg that was destined to be amputated from a lack of circulation. I tried everything to save it. I almost gave up the fight until I read this wonderful book. I put the advice that Patricia Bragg gave in the book into practice and started fasting as much as my body would tolerate. After 5 weeks of a radical diet change and some fasting I noticed some improvement and over time my ulcers disappeared and I'm happy to say I have all 10 toes and 2 happy feet. I am healthier and very VERY thankful for "" THE MIRACLE OF FASTING"" Buy the book! You'll never be the same!"
2,Poorly organized,"This book is a train wreck--I don't think the Braggs used an editor or a co-writer to help organize and edit the work, so it's highly repetetive and difficult to follow. The basic information is ""fasting is great for your health"" and that you should use their products, including cider vinegar--the book is chock full of plugs for their many products. It also has lots of uncited quotes and weird Bible quotes, some of which are not in the Bible if you take the time to look them up. There's lots of upbeat energy in the book, but it's out of date, and you're better of reading Joel Fuhrman. I think the Braggs mean well, but I think the book would be far more useful if it had been taken on by a professional publisher. As usual there are many testimonials and case histories, but I don't think the Braggs were very well educated or particularly sophisticated--fasting is probably great for most people, but get your information from a source that you can actually understand."
3,Good info,"This book got me to start fasting and also become a vegetarian.About a week later I went vegan. I am convinced meat and animal by product are not good for me.And I am doubly convinced that me eating animals or their by products is really bad for the animals.The book repeats itself quite a bit, but it accomplished its mission.I now fast every Monday. I am losing weight (about 2 pounds a week), without trying.Read it if you want to get motivated to be healthier."
1,"If you think it works, use it!","I don't know about most people, but this stuff did not agree with me. I never got sick, but I never saw any positive results either. Although your mileage may vary.I'm into the health food movement like a lot of people nowdays. Unfortunately most books and programs don't cover all of the many ways to get and stay healthy. Although the above book listed is an excellent resource. It's like most authors and programs are trying to be too pc (politically correct). To correct myself a little, most health advice, programs, books and supplements usually offer pretty good advice these days.You know:1. Don't alcohol2. Don't abuse drugs3. Don't smoke (cigaretts and the like)4. Eat move live fresh fruits and vegetables.5. Eat less process foods and meats.Now all of this is good advice, although there is a right way and wrong way to do anything. I saw an excellent book with a good 8 step plan. Search Amazon for: The Magic Of Mother Nature's Healing Foods. I liked it."
1,infomercial in book form,"Dr. Bragg does a lot of Bragging throughout this book. Parts are interesting if you can wade through the constant self boasting about ""the Bragg way"". It's like reading an infomercial."
3,"An ""Infomercial"" and condescending","The only thing that makes this book a step above an infomercial is that you have to read it! The authors also seemed to talk down to the readers, assuming we wouldn't understand unless they put it in the simplest of terms. I've seen better essays (grammatically) from first year college students -- I kept getting thrown off with all the sentence fragments and had a hard time figuring out where the authors were going with those fragments.The content did interest me, and I think there were many valid points. I just didn't like the presentation."
1,horrible,"Mostly its killing. I like killing as much as the next man, but in this book it is so unrealistic that it isn't even exciting. Just boom!Dead.Boom!Dead.Boom!Dead.Boom!Dead.That's basically the whole book."
4,Suite l'infidèle S. Weis,I'm learning to play Suite L'infidèle of S. Weis myself and have been listening to variuos artists.This one is the best.Hein Dirix
5,Stunning performance of baroque music,This is a wonderfully expressive performance of Baroque music. Aussel is a rare talent not only in the classical guitar world but in the classic music world.
4,$4.49 at Whole Foods,I use this for work. It's very quick and easy and much better than the vile coffee they provide.I don't understand the price though. A 2 oz jar at Whole Foods was $4.49 well before the exp. date.
1,The Worst Coffee,Medaglia D'Oro has to be the worst coffee I've ever had. It had an old musty flavor and odor. You get what pay for.
3,comment after finish,"This is really a normal taste coffee. I would not buy more after I finish this one. In fact, I will still be sleepy after drinking two cups!"
3,thank you,"The party I had you send this product to, is ENJOYING it immensley. He is unable to purchase this product in Arizona.Obviously, certain products are not available in his location and I was happy to help out. I want to thank you for your quick response in securing this request and I am sure he will look to order it in the future. Thank You...mario"

3,"Sea's Gift Korean Seaweed Snack (Kim Nori), Sweet, 0.69-Ounce Bags","Good flavor, although the sea salted version is a bit greasy. Way too much packaging for the small amount of product inside (especially the sea salted version. Also, the sweet version makes a bit of a mess and could cause upset stomach.I have more confidence in the product because it is sold at whole foods. I would question anything out of china at this point in time with all the china recalls.I would recommend this product as a snack though, it is flavorful (I personally love seaweed!)"
2,Sea's Gift Korean Seaweed Snack Sweet,Sea's Gift Korean Seaweed Snack Sweet. Not that good. Way Over Priced for what you get. Will not buy again.
1,Parfum?,"I was extremely disappointed in the product. While shown as Eau de Parfum, inferring that it would be a strong and lasting fragrance, the scent is extremely light and does not last on the wearer. The box actually refers to some sort of ""splash"" which was not indicated on line. Thought I was getting ""parfum"" and it appears to be a refresher, not a fragrance."
4,Surprisingly good,"Wife thought it strange with a title ""green tea"" and did not think it would be any good. Turns out she liked it which is a good thing as it was a gift from me. :)EDIT: 2012- This is still my wife's favorite perfume after 4 years of use, she has tried other perfumes during this time but keeps coming back to this one."
3,perfume,"This wasnt the fragrance I was looking for, but I liked it anyway. I plan to shop again for the one I really wanted."
1,extremely disappointed with seller,"I am very disappointed with the seller and have already forewarned family, friends, and co workers NOT TO ORDER from the seller. I am appauled that AMAZON would even have a relationship with such. I not only did not receive my item, I did not receive a credit. I blame AMAZON a bit as well because my FULL address is noted, but it was suggested that all of my information was not given to the seller...how ironic. None the less, I am so disappointed at this point and I honestly don't feel I will ever us AMAZON again."
1,Item arrived broken,I love this scent and ordered it from amazon recently. The perfume arrived with the cap broken into pieces !The one star is for amazon which has a history of messing up orders.
5,Elizabeth Arden Fragrances,"I recently purchased the scent Elizabeth Arden Green Tea fragrance, I have alaways been a fan of this line as I have worked in the past as a consultant in a major departmenr store.This particular scent has a very clean & nice scent,not too overpowering and can be worn for daytime/night. There are some fragrances that simply are very strong and should only be used for an evening scent.I have to be extremely careful since I have a sensitivity issue with some and this particular one did not make me break out ect.I would recommend this fragrance to anyone who likes a nice clean smelling scent that lasts the whole day through without having to reapply."
1,Disappointment,"I received the product yesterday. This is not what I expected at all, from the packaging to the scent. The packaging feels cheap, and the scent is so light that it disappears after 10 minutes. I've purchased Sunflower from local stores before, and expected the similar packaging for this product. This is the first time that my purchase from Amazon turned out to be an disappointment."
4,Scent doesn't stay long,"I love this perfume a lot and even bought my second bottle. The smell is very refreshing and light. A little of tea and citrus smell. The only problem is the smell doesn't stay whole day. By end of the day, I can barely smell it. And it requires more sprays to be noticeable, so a bottle won't last that long compares to the other brand that I used."
1,big disppointment...BEWARE...,"Do NOT buy this product. Really a big disappointment... I bought few of these products for my mom and cousins. It turned out that they have the same impression about the product. The fragrance / scent only last for a few minutes. Even if they tried to use more, the scent didn't last longer. BEWARE!!! NOT recommended!!!"
3,Green Tea Parfum Spray,I have not worn this scent for a few years. Since I started wearing it again I have gotten many compliments. Only complaint is the scent does not last.
4,Innovative,"I really like ""Omnielectronica"". Rather than being repetitive and boring like most other cd's of this genre, ""Omnielectronica"" is unpredictable, whimsical, and mentally stimulating. I love the exotic sound of ""Hitoshizuku gigaku/hydrophonics""- it's fun yet still oddly soothing. ""Skyport"" is like outer space meets techno. My favorite track is ""LNNN""; its sound is enchanting and surreal- it's pure escapism. The art form known as ""music"" is constantly evolving- this cd is a perfect example of the innovation and unrestrained creativity that takes music to an entirely new level."
3,"Great Service from Seller, Product gave me problems...","Seller provided great service. Product arrived earlier than expected. Product arrived in great conditions and is what I needed/ordered.As for the bracket... It fits, it holds the Whole House Water Filter unit, but for some reason, when installed, it blocked the canister from getting fully seated causing a leak. We needed to disassemble the unit and grind down the lower half of the bracket. Was this an abnormal bracket, or the reason different brackets are now being used.With extra time and effort, the bracket is holding well."
2,Frustrating,"The instructions have you place the holes in the bracket between the fittings going in and out of the filter head and the filter head itself. Doing this kept the fittings from sealing properly causing them to leak. It also caused interference with the bottom of the filter housing and it wouldn't allow that to seal properly. Perfect concept, but under tested."
1,Very poor fit,Avoid this product. You have to grind down part of the metal to make this fit with the filter housing. It is cheap and it shows. I tossed it and am going to use a better (more expensive) bracket.
3,Enjoyable yet very frustrating read,"The book was a fast read and had some really cute parts, but I got frustrated in that Hallie and Steve did not seriously getting together until the last 10 pages of the book. When you read a romance novel you want the ""action"" in the romance to happen a lot sooner that that; it took over 400 pages before there was actually a serious kiss. Todd and Donalee got all the love and ""action"" in the last half of the book, Hallie and Steve got nothing; even at the end of the book they couldn't make love because of the kids and Hallie's sister. That made the book a disappointment for me."
4,Not your usual cheese,"OK, I admit I was very skepitcal when my friend loaned me this book. I mean, she reads cheezy romance novels, those famous ""bodice-rippers."" Nothing wrong with that, just not my style. But the minute I picked this book up, I couldn't put it down! I agree with someone else about how Hallie changed herself to fit what a man wants and how that's not something to really admire. I agree, but if you don't take the book so seriously and don't view Hallie as a role model in that way, it's a fun, fast read. Very entertaining!"
3,quick read,"I like Debbie Macomber... this book was an easy read. Not a ""page turner"" but good for a rainy day"
4,mistress of feel-good romance,"This Matter of Marriage is the 60th stand-alone novel by Debbie Macomber. Hallie McCarthy suddenly finds herself, at almost thirty, a career woman who wants to have a family. So she sets out to achieve that, like she does in her successful business. First she loses weight, then she starts dating. But the dates are disasters: lucky she has her new next-door-neighbour, Steve Marris, to commiserate and, occasionally, come to the rescue. She gets on well with his kids and counts herself lucky to have him as a friend. Anyway, he's not her type, and he's still hung up on his ex-wife. This is a light-hearted romantic comedy, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments as well as a few lump-in-the-throat ones. Debbie Macomber is the mistress of feel-good romance and this is no exception."
3,Expected more,"I've read several of Debbie Macomber's books and find them all an easy read. This one, however, was a disappointment in that it lacked the customary substance I usually find."
5,book review,Enjoyed this book as I do all of her books. She is a great writer and I have enjoyed many many of her books. Loved the sstory line.
3,This Matter of Marriage,Starts slow and never really picks up speed. I am a Deb MaComber fan and this is a surprising disappointment
4,Matter Of Marriage,I just got through reading this book and enjoyed it very much. I have found that there are very few Debbie Macomber books that I don't like. Her writing style is very good and her characters come to life for you.
2,trop cliché,"Well, what's there to say. Not very original. Every cliché there is in the book are in this book. First of all, who gets up one morning and decide to get married within 1 year. My guess is if this book would have been 75 pages shorter it would go down easier. The plot is so cliché, the author give the reader a heads up two pages before the punch line. I think this was a hit and miss book.One good think, the blind dates are very funny. Read something else."
4,matter of mariage,Great read as always Debbie Macomber comes thru with another great one. Interesting plot and well developed characters. Can't wait for the next book to come out!
2,so disappointed,"I find it so hard to believe that this book was written by the same author as ""Changing Habits"" and the Blossom Street Series. I have read over a dozen of Macombers books, really enjoying them for what they, a great story about relationships and quirky personalities.I was SO disappointed in ""This Matter of Marriage"". Probably the most predictable book I've ever read, with weak and boring characters. I added this Macomber book to my Kindle, so I'd have a book to read on our long car trip....big mistake.Come on Ms. Macomber, you can do better than this!"
3,This Matter of Marriage,"Very Cute book. Funny Dialog, easy reading. This book will not make you over think, it just flows as entertaining. A simple moral of the story, ""looking for something when it was right in front of you the entire time""."
4,A good mix of romance and humor.,"I enjoyed reading this book. It held my interest and provided a good mix of romance and humor. I didn't give it a five-star rating because the story line wasn't all that deep; it didn't cause me to do any soul searching, and I didn't have to strain my brain to determine how it would end. It was an entertaining way to escape from everyday concerns for a few hours."
2,It's Ok,"Liked the first couple of tracks, and when it comes to download vs CD ... if I like more than one song, chances are I'll like the rest and buy the cd. While this formula has worked well for me in the past, I should have just bought those tracks through amazon or itunes."
3,Not their best work.,"The biggest problem I have with Subkutan is that it's just so dang boring. This genre of music has always been largely driven by catchy, hit-calibre singles, and even the real masters departed from that only in the sense that they surrounded their hit-calibre singles with smoothly integrated album tracks that elevated the entire CD to a something like a symphony; a coherent whole.Here, though--almost all of the songs sound like b-sides that were abandoned because they didn't do enough. The closest thing to a dance-floor anthem is ""The End"", although it's not really ideal for that role, and a number of tracks compete to overcome the general mediocrity of the album and rise to the level of ""great ballad.""But overall, the album was more likely to put me to sleep than anything else."
2,The cheeply made annoying tape.,I got a similar tape of trucks made by a different company. That immediately became my kids' favorite tape. That made me think this would be similar with more variety. NOPE! The person who made this was a cheesy and foolish as possible. It is painful to have on the TV. The kids and he are reading scripts that sound like a 4th grader wrote. NOT the tape you are looking for. look elsewhere!
5,The Art of the Scrapbook,"A must have for any scrapbook or book artist! Beautiful illustrations which inspire creativity, and easy to follow instructions for the beginner. I can't stop looking through it! The art work is exceptional, and all the designs are inspiring. I have completed some of the examples and am planning my next project. I loved this book, since it brings scrapbooking to an artist level which was, I believe, needed."
2,Item did not work,I give this meter low marks. I did not work. In my opion you should not buy this item. Spend the money and get a good meeter.
4,good perfromance for the money,"The resolution on the output is coarse (0.1A, not sure about the tolerance but guessing 10%) so the measurement is best suited for items that consume like 700W and above. If your intent is to measure current draw on a space heater, microwave or power strip then ths meter will work well. There's a convenience that comes with clamp meters and as long as you understand the meter can only work with a single current-carrying wire in its jaws then you can reliably measure current consumption w/o the need for test harnesses or plugging/unplugging equipment. I bought this for $20 and you really can't beat that price."
1,Defective unit or inaccurate?,"Not sure if mine was defective or if this unit is just inaccurate, but I returned my order because it wasnt reading anything correctly. Tried a new battery, still no difference."
1,Don't even bother!,"I was buying this hoping that I would get a somewhat decent multimeter with an inductive pickup for cheep. Yet it came with nice probes and a nice case. But, This thing was a waste of my time don't get it. The voltage nor does the amperage work. Not even the inductive pickup works. I tried getting in touch with the manufacturer with email and phone and nothing. If give it less if I could. DO NOT BUY THIS"
1,defective,"Sorry , can't give it a good review, the ohm meter was the only thing that worked on it. defective unit"
1,Got a defective unit,"I also got a defective unit. I tried everything (new battery, different ranges, etc) but the clamp meter simply did not work so I returned it."
5,Nice product,The breadboard is pretty sturdy compared to other ones i have used. Easy to use and it comes with jumper wire kit. Must have for any electrical engineers!
2,Not last long,Poor quality - The tapes got deteriorated after a few months of use. The tape frequently halts during the middle of the exercise.
4,Great new stuff.from a fan of the original Dakoka band!,"I remember the band live in Rochester, NY in 1979-1983, and loved their versatile sound and memorable original songs, and have their ""Three Times Live"" CD (recorded live before they opened for Queen in the early 80's), which is superb, so ordered this 90's version of the band with a new line-up surrounding band leader Jerry H. Excellent AOR, melodic rock from a band that had never received the promotional support from their record company to make it big, but had the sound and talent to do so. I recommed this CD--get their live CD also (try a websearch to find their homepage.)"
5,Truck theme perfect for my son,My son loves his truck themed pillow cases and bedspread. The quality is very good on the pillow cases and it's bright and colorful. The blanket is a bit thin but luckily he is a warm sleeper and it doesn't get too cold where we live.
2,Not what I was looking for,"This is a great book if you are interested in the history or philosophy of Pilates. It is not, however, a good book if you are interested in doing Pilates at home. The basic conclusion of the book is--find a good trainer and a good Pilates studio. The authors give great advice about these things, but I was hoping to have more clear advice on doing Pilates at home (I live in a community--San Juan, Puerto Rico--without a good Pilates studio.)"
5,"Cleaner water, Cleaner air","I read this book in the summer of 1994, and was very impressed with the depth of research that went into it. Mr. Mele was deeply and properly concerned about the impact that 2 cycle outboard motors have on the marine environment. He pointed out that the average outboard released about 30% of the fuel it consumed unburned into the air and water. The total volume of fuel was calculated. This book is critical of the regulation, or lack thereof, that the US EPA had put on marine engine emissions. There has been a significant improvement in new engines since 1993, I would like to see what Mr. Mele thinks of the current selection of outboard and inboard marine engines. This should be required reading for every boat owner."
2,Not as expected.,"Bought this as a gift for my mother, and was rather disappointed. Turned out shorter than it appears in pictures, and colors were much brighter and gaudier than expected from the pictures shown (seen on more than one monitor at different houses). Does not wash well according to the instructions on tag. It came out very puckered at the areas around the embroidery. :("
1,MuuMuu,"I was disappointed that it had to be ironed. I am older and can't stand at an ironing board anymore. Otherwise, I loved it."
5,LOVELY DRESS FOR THE MONEY,THIS WAS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND. SHE LIKED IT VERY MUCH AND FOUND THE MATERIAL COMFORTABLE AND THEDESIGN VERY CUTE. NEED MORE ITEMS THAT ARE REASONABLY PRICED IN THIS WORLD OF HIGH PRICES FOR NICECLOTHING.THANKS AMAZON
5,Wonderful Story and Illustrations,"Got this book for 3 of us. For me, because of the illustrations. For my brother and great nephew because my brother is taking Spanish to keep up with his grandson (my nephew) who is growing up bilingual. My brother thinks it's pretty advanced Spanish, but is working on it. The story is wonderful! Worth it even if you don't speak Spanish. The text is set up so both the English and Spanish are on the same page."
4,BEST LEVEL 42 CONCERT AVAILABLE.,THIS CONCERT IS PROBABLY THE BEST LEVEL 42 CONCERT AVAILABLE I GIVE 4 STARS BECAUSE OF THE SOUND IS NOT BAD IS NOT DIGITAL HIGH QUALITY IT CAN BE BETTER I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A 1986 OLD CONCERT BESIDE THIS THE EXTRA INTERVIEW WITH MARK KING IS VERY INTERESTING IF YOU BUY THIS DVD YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE DISSAPOINTING INSTEAD IS EXQUISITE....L.VILLANUEVA
5,Gotta see it!!!,If you are a L42 fan or you just like good pop/r&b music this is the video for you.I am a huge fan and first saw this video on MTV of all places in 1987 or 88.This will remind you of the good ol'days when bands actually played music.It also reminds you just how good these guys were together.I saw them live in 87 in Columbia SC and this holds faithful to that experience.Do yourself a huge favor and purchase this!
5,one of the funkiest concerts ive seen,I love this concet this is my 2nd vhs tape i let my friend borrow the 1st one and i never got it back. i pray it comes out on dvd.
2,False representation,"I'm not a great connaisseur of Level 42, but I like very much the first four tracks of the CD Running in the family. I was thus according a great value to this DVD according to the presence of theses tracks. The back cover of the DVD box indicates that Children Say, Lessons in Love and Running in the Family are part of the concert, but the latter is a video clip ! The fourth song I was disappointed not to find on this DVD is It's Over. I think every body on the edge of purchasing this DVD should be aware of that."
3,Strange navigation on DVD,"I have always loved Level 42 and just needed a way to reminisce...I used to listen to them while on the way to the beach back in the 80's. The PQ/SQ is just above average considering the concert was recorded less than 10 yrs ago. The only bad comment I have about this disc is that by track #7, the concert is no longer continuous. After each song, the disc navigates back to menu...a little annoying!"
3,Great concert....weak transfer,"While great to see this concert again in video form, the DVD isn't really any better in quality over the old VHS I had."
4,"Nice Heavy, Useful Pan","This Lodge pan is useful for cooking on the stove-top as well as in the oven. However, it's not non-stick, so be sure to use butter, oil, or a non-stick spray. Detailed instructions on use and care are included and the pan comes in several gorgeous colors. We finally decided on cafe' brown and are very pleased with the appearance. (If you have an induction cooktop, Lodge pans are definitely the best choice!)"
2,60CS Neoprene GPS Case,"A perfect fit, but, a waste of money for me. Can't access connectors without removing GPS from case. The clear plastic sticks to the GPS screen and makes it hard to remove the GPS from the case. I do not use this case at all."
4,best for the price,"I have found this to be a very nice addition to the gps unit. My only complaint is the ""belt loop"" is actually to small to be of use. I clip the unit to my bag. Other than that the quality is great."
4,pretty nice,This does make sweet cakes. I'm a terrible baker. When I made this cake the head actually came off even though I followed the directions! I used a tooth pick and icing to reattach it and you would never have known. We used it to make a Lamb cake at Christmas and sing happy birthday to Jesus-- it was a big hit with all the young grandkids and a sweet tradition we hope to continue each year as a reminder that Christmas is in fact to celebrate Jesus's birthday! We hope the grandkids will look forward to it each year.
5,Just like my mom used,"My mom used to make lamb cakes every Easter. My sister has my mom's mold, and for years I have been looking for the same one... finally found it! Works perfect, makes cakes just like my mom used to!"
3,Warning: Decapitation may ensue,"I had a lot of fun making this cake. However, I was a little saddened when my poor cake decapitated itself when placed in the fridge to ""chill."" The other drawback that I noticed is that the lamb's body is a little bit scrawny. I was fortunate that I had also baked the excess cake batter ahead of time, so was able to add to the body of my cake. All that to say, it was a lot of work to go through for a cake that fell apart so easily. Try using less pourous cake batter. Maybe that would help."
5,great,my mom bought this and she really liked it and was happy with her purchase. it came in great condition!!
2,Baaaad lamb cake mold,"Growing up my mom always made a lanb cake for Easter, so I thought I would try it. Last year I borrowed a lamb cake mold from a friend and it was great. So I bought this one from Nordic Ware and was disappointed because it cliamed to interlock the top and bottom. Yes the two pieces did fit together but did NOT lock together at all. When the cake expanded from baking it pushed the top about ahalf inch up from the bottom so it was a fat little lamb cake. Also the pans were not very heavy aluminum like the ones I borrowed. They were very thin."
3,A Good Starter Bat,"This is a good starter bat for a less competitive league. The Insanity SP Bat has decent pop and is balanced well, for the money its a good bat to begin with."
3,FOOTBALL MANAGER 2005 (SOCCER),Great game! a must for any soccer fans to try and get the experience of running a football team! You can start from the top or the bottom rung and check out tips from the internet websites from the links page in the manual...it well help a LOT!
4,works very well,I've been running this pump for 2 months now in a 15 gallon tank pushing a 12 inch air stone and a 3 inch air disc and it's always worked adequately. It pushes more bubbles than I really need so I actually use in-line air valves to slow the bubbles down. I actually bought a second one for my two small tanks.
3,This pump is NOT silent!,"I don't know if I got a bad pump or not, but it is definitely NOT silent. There is a low frequency vibration that is quite loud, and worse yet it cycles (changes frequency). I agree with the other 3 star reviewer. Perhaps the folks that said it was ""silent"" got exceptional units, but I doubt it given the pump's mechanism. I suspect their definition of ""silent"" needs a bit of adjustment...I'm sending it back and continuing my search for a truly quiet air pump. That or put the old Top Fin pump in some sort of box..."
4,Ver good value,"Absolutely silent - no, but very quite. And the air volume very sufficient. Very pleased and reccomend. Catfish Charlie reccomends as well."
4,Good cheap air pump for small tank,This unit was half price compared to Petco. Excellent output and very quiet. I also purchased some tubing and anti-siphon valves.
5,very good product,This product is very good its reel silent and provides more than enough oxygen for the fishes this item is also not so big tetra = very good product
2,Noisy,"I bought this small one and a bigger one from Tetra. This small one is noisy and vibrating (no load), not any quieter than the one I was using 10 years ago. The bigger one however is much quieter, but it's definitely no whispering either. Anyway, I don't intend to use it inside the house."
1,Terrible pressure,"bought this to aerate worm casting tea...this sorry piece of equipment didn't have enough pressure to force ANY air thru one little dinky air stone..Maybe I got a poor one, don't know but it is a piece of JUNK!!! I wish there was a ZERO STAR since that is what it is worth."
4,Good Pump,Good pump. I use it to add a little more air to a 20 gallon tank and it works well for my purpose. Not sure if it would push air through a long air stone but it's good for the 10-Gallon range that it is advertised at.
3,ok pump,"This is an ok pump, nothing spectacular, there are other pumps that pump more sound better and cost less. I was dissapointed with the output compared to other small pumps."
2,Silent because it moves less air than a breath,This had very little air movement - less than a whisper. It would've been fine for a pint jar. I returned it and after return postage I got a buck-fifty back. It cost me five-fifty to try. If the reviews would've been more accurate I could've saved the money.
1,Loud!,"this thing is loud and does not pump very good at all. Buy the pump that is made for hydroponics growing, not that much more and well worth it its about 50% quieter and its adjustable."
1,Died after 5 months,I was using this pump to power two small airstones. It became unstable after 3 months and completely died after 5 months. For the short time is worked it was very quiet.
5,Quieter than a whisper,"Had a unit that was extremely loud and shook whatever surface you put it on. Husband looked up this model online and saw the great reviews so we went and picked one up as soon as we could. Since then, all we've heard is the bubbles breaking the surface. The pump has sound dampeners inside of it and is securely sitting in a rubber dome with feet. This design truly works! Can't hear a thing (and hasn't even vibrated itself off the self either). It also came with an air regulator since this pump can be used for any size up to 10 gallons, you can adjust for the smaller tanks. Highly recommend it!"
3,"Yell, not Whisper","I was expecting a quiet pump from reviews & product description, but it was just as loud and annoying as any other pump I've gotten. Works good, but noisy even on carpet."
5,air pump,I bought two of these as I have two aquariums. I love that they have a control knob so I can adjust the amount of air that pumps into the water. I have one small tank and the adjustable pump means my small fish are not pushed around by the air swirling through the water too fast for them.
1,Make working sound but no air after coupla hours.,"Bought this pump and hooked it up to my air stone in a 8 gal tank, it started working perfectly. So i leave it plugged in went to work, came home only to find the pump making sounds but not pushing any air. I'm so disappointed."
3,noisy,I returned this air pump because it was not quiet. Bought another one locally (and paid more) but it was quiet. Seems there are quality control issues.
3,3 years later...,"I bought 2 of these about three years ago for my 30 and 10 gallon tanks. The 10 gallon version is still going strong and I actually use it in the 30 gallon tank now because the 30 gallon version burned out. No idea why, but the 30gal version's performance degraded over time until it couldn't even power a single stone. The 10 gallon version has exceptional output and I have it split into 4 stones without trouble. These aren't silent, but if you're used to them the white noise is comforting (drowns out road noise and such). If I were purchasing another I'd probably give Hagen a try, I'm quite please with a filter I bought from them, extremely quiet. If you're looking for sheer durability, try a Penn Plax air pump. I have one from the 80's that still running strong, however, it's relatively loud."
3,not whisper quiet,"The pump works fine, we got one rated up to 10 gallons for our shrimp breeding tank, to replace our old one that was very noisy. This one is definitely more powerful but we don't find it any quieter than the 1990s one we had. Disappointing."
3,Not as quiet as I hoped,"Bought on review of its quietness, but the noise is louder than the filter's, but torable. Lots bubbles though, guess I will just keep it."
2,i hate it.,This thing is so freaking noisy. I have other air pumps that are silent...this one sounds like a really noisy buzzing...gets worse if it is resting on something hard. I hate it.
1,Really noisy!,"I thought the little pump that came together with the fish tank i bought was noisy, so i search amazon and found this pump with good review for its noise. But immediately after i tested it, i decided to send it back. It was much noisier than the non-branded pump that came with my fish tank. Really a waste of time and effort."
4,works great!,this is a nice pump at a great price. I'm very pleased with it! it has great air flow and it's quiet
3,Not for me...,"While this product may work well for some people, the padding is too thin and does not pad my knees enough to avoid aggravating my arthritis. I had to buy a much thicker item that does the job better.The product shipped on time so I have no problem with the service and wouldn't hesitate to buy something else from this seller."
2,not worth the money,"sure this thing might work if you can stand having that tight thing on your leg all night... I tried it for 10 minutes and was so uncomfortable with that just being on my leg. I""m also so restless that I flip from one side to the other so I think the pillow is my best bet... The size was spot on but when your trying to sleep you don't really want anything constricting on you, it wasn't really all that tight but it was awkward.... I can't imagine putting that thing on every night..."
4,"not bad, but could be better...","Includes a lot of info, but not thorough enough in its contextual analysis"
2,Again not excellent just as 2nd one...,"Again i couldn't find songs that's played originally in movie such as track 20 ""S*!thole theme""So the same comment with 2nd album.. not excellent but ""good""I hope we can find ""extended"" ost albums soon..."
5,Saw III soundtrack,"This is an overall awesome cd. It has some great songs from some awesome artists! If I'm this impressed with the soundtrack, I expect the movie to be off the hook too!"
1,Saw 3,"I again did not revieve the item I ordered from Amazon US, this was one of three DVD's that I ordered and Amazon US sent me three soundtracks which I returned.Barry Australia"
4,nice carpet,The colors are not as vibrant as in the picture but it I think it works better that way. The carpet is very soft and makes a great addition to any room.
2,"If you like the ""Pleated"" look....","I was at first happy to find an area rug that matched the color scheme of my living room and that took advantage of my ""Prime"" membership's free two day shipping and was fulfilled by Amazon. That being said, I was very surprised to see, after unrolling the rug, that there was NO cardboard roll in the center of the rug to keep it from creasing; this of course lead to the rug having multiple ""pleats"" that I am as of yet unable to rectify. Then there is the quality, it is thin and the glue that they used to secure the stitching is brittle which means that within a few month it will start to break down. All-in-all if you want an area rug that is ""disposable"" as well as the money spent to purchase it, than this is your best bet."
3,Creates a lot of dirt by itself,The design is gr8!!But threads are all over the carpet. Being black those shreds are pretty much visible. Cleaning headache
1,"If you love wrinkles, you will love this!","The color of the rug was great for my room. It was so wrinkled that I put tarps down underneath, steamed 2 or 3 times, put heavy totes, paint cans, anything else heavy on it to smooth it out. It was an absolute mess. I even tried laying damp towels underneath all the heavy stuff. I couldn't leave them on long because the carpet would start smelling. I left all of this on for 3 weeks. I tried to take the stuff off before that but it continued to be a mess. I have it on a bare floor. I truly do not think it would every straighten out if it was laying on top of carpet. If I had not liked the color and style so much, I would have returned it immediately."
3,shipped very fast!!,"The rug(s) were at my door in just a few days. But I would have to agree, they dont lay flat and I had to ""press"" the wrinkles out. Other than that..... I would say a very good buy for the $$$."
4,"Great, but......","This book was great, but some of the things I needed to know about newts weren't in it."
1,Poor quality,"These are very poorly made, They have a cheap motor on them, fan shutters do not work properly. Right out of the box the shutters were damaged. Spend the extra cash and get a good one from graingers."
2,Not good quality,"I didn't actually get to run or install this item because when it came in the louvers were bent and damaged. I think it was a mix of the cheap quality of the louvers (very thin, almost like a beer can) and that the packaging wasn't sufficient to protect them. I had ordered this to replace a 24 inch TPI fan that was too large for my shed. I am returning this and getting the 18 inch TPI fan. Quality was much better."
1,flimsy construction,The fan is okthe mounting and shudders adr very poorly made and not designed wellthe construction is no well thought out. for example there are protrusions that require you to make a holelarger than needed in the wall that is not covered by the trimJim
2,Ordered tabs and got powder,"The chemical works fine but it was approx 50 % powder when it was delivered. I ordered the 3"" tabs for ease of use and now I've having to scoop heavy, broken up small pieces up with powder and dissolving in H2O before adding to pool. Ive ordered 3"" chlorine tabs on line before and did not have this problem."
2,Not Impressed - lots of broken tablets,"I received these tablets a few days ago and today opened the lid, unfortunately, a large amount of the tablets were broken and there was an incredible amount of Chlorine powder everywhere."
5,Long lasting chlorine,Use yearly in our 24 ft.pool. Slow dissolving and stabilizes the water. Never a case of algae. Live in the north where season is about 3 months so this 9 lbs. should last all summer. Great deal.
3,Very large tabs...not great for hot tubs,"Based on the required amount of chlorine for a 600 gallon hot tub, these tablets are too large. I have to break them into quarters to avoid over-chlorinating."
1,tablets all broke up,seems to be a good product but when i received them through the mail some of the tablets were all broken up and the bottom of the inside of the bucket has dust from where the tablets are so broken up i will not buy again because they are not individually wrapped neither are they even in a bag so some of the dust wascan out of the bucket and was in the shipping box good product but not worth the money if they are saw dust.
2,Chlorine strength?,Purchased a 35 lb container from Lowes for $65 approx +tax. Great price and cheaper than Costco's brand BUT I find the strength by smelling the tablets kind of weaker than other brands. I will tell better after a few weeks in the dispenser if it works as well as the ones I bought last year at Home Depot which was $5 more. Fussy-GuyItem is just as good as the most expensive chlorides. Save your $$$$$$$!
3,Powder,"This is in the product description ""Manufactured to resist crumbling"". I think they need to go back to the drawing board on this one. 1/3 of the bucket was powder from these being shipped. The second 1/3 of the bucket is large broken pieces, and the last 1/3 are still whole."
2,Track list!,"01 Do I Make A Difference02 Heaven On Earth03 Nothing to Do04 This Time (Will We Conquer The Pain)05 Side By Side06 Out of the Blue07 Tnederness Carresses08 I've Come Home09 The Walk10 Set Them Free11 Fame and Fortune12 Freckles, Jellybeans"
4,A book to get you started.,"If you're the type of person that likes to do things without a lot of theory, this is a great book.I'm a novice gardener and the introduction gardening instructions just didn't have enough information for me. I decided to purchase Gardening For Dummies and various other books to satisfy my need for detailed information before setting some serious time, money, and effort into a balcony garden for my apartment.This book has great ideas and did a good job of introducing me to different herbs and plants to grow to be used in cooking. But if you want to get more ""hardcore"" with gardening I recommend getting other texts as well."
4,A good start!,"This was the second herb book that I've read. The photograpy is amazing and the insructions they give are clear.The book is beautiful, but it shouldn't be the first one you read. It does not have very detailed instructions on growing, drying, etc.That being said, it's not a waste of time or money, and I would reccomend this to anyone interested in herbs.I give this a B-."
4,Growing Herbs at Home.,This seems to be a really good book on growing Herbs for Brown thumbs like me. I have not actually used any of the advice/tips yet but all sound very easy and understandable. I will wait a little longer to start again with growing Herbs again. (Weather)
4,Simply and sturdy head for monopods,"This is a good quality product, as one would expect from Bogen.Works as advertized and is easy to use."
1,ARRIVED DAMAGED,"The sink arrived with a big dent in it. There is nothing I can use it for with such a large dent in it, so I will return it. Since the outer box was not dented, the item was shipped with a large dent in the bottom clearly showing."
4,"This is a separate video from Ballet 101,201","I just wanted to add to what others wrote about the need for clarification of what's in this video. I was looking for a ballet combinations video, and when I searched I kept finding ""Ballet 101 & 201, combinations"", and I thought that it was some sort of combination sale of Ballet 101 and Ballet 201 in a package. Finally I realized that it was actually a separate video of ballet combinations, which is exactly what I was looking for."
1,Major Disappointment,"The first two RWW books were pretty good. This one is awful.Take out the parts where RWW burdens us with his personal opinions on politics, the environment and gays, (who cares?) and all that's left is a weak plot and some dismal characters.Gave it one star because I finished it. I shouldn't have wasted the time. What drivel."
3,The Mangrove Coast,This book is good even if it is a bit slow. I enjoy series novels and Randy Wayne white does not disappoint.
1,I forgot how bad this guy was,"When I came across this writer in a recommendation for books set in Florida, I remembered that I used to read his stuff, but couldn't remember why I quit. It has been at least ten years since I tortured myself by actually finishing one of his books. I don't know where to start except to say I'm not a huge fan of old guys who think they are super heroes. Maybe other old guys with no life find this b.s. to be entertaining, but I have better things to do than waste any more of my life or money on Randy Wayne White."
5,Excellent!,"I've been a fan of Randy Wayne White since I read Sanibel Flats and have eagerly anticipated every new book. The only unsuccessful book in the series was The Man Who Invented Florida, written in a Carl Hiaassen, Laurence Shames comedic style that never quite rang true. Mr. White has a superb prose style, both elegant and evocative. The characters are well rounded and sympathetic, the dialogue riveting. The references of other reviewers that Doc Ford is a sort of poor-man's Travis McGee, in my opinion, misses the mark. Ford is a far more complex character than Travis McGee, and the plots of the Doc Ford novels are far less formulaic. Every Travis McGee novel seemed to pit the hero against a man who, basically, was both tougher and smarter than McGee. Travis McGee always seemed to win out with a large helping of serendipity. The Mangrove Coast immediately grabs the reader and doesn't let go until the very end. Highly recommended."
2,Boring and depressing,"I've enjoyed many of White's books for his engaging characters and suspenseful plots. However, this one's not one of his best. The plot takes a long time to get going, and the characters are so pathetic, or so unsavory, that I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.In White's defense, probably a real-life covert operation would be 75% research and 25% excitement. However, this ratio does not work well in a book. The hero spends too much time doing his research at home, and only the last quarter of the book rescuing the troubled victim. And the ending -- depressing and pointless."
1,Not sure.,"I am reading all of the books in the series. Usually about two a week...they are sooo good. But this one, I am really not sureMr. White wrote. It is so dissimilar to the rest."
2,"Great ending, weak plot","I've followed the Doc Ford series with a lot of enthusiasm. But I found Mangrove Coast very slow to get going. It took about 250 pages for Doc to quit spewing his philosophies on the ills of society and get some action going. Great ending,but it just doesn't make up for a long, drawn-out middle. Ambrose Bierce said something like ""A novel is just a short story padded"". That quote about sums it up for me. But do read the rest of the series."
3,How much bread are you bakin,"This is a fine breadboard. My complaint is that it is really smaller than I thought it would be. So, it worked as advertised - but I would recommend getting the larger breadboard unless you really hate having extra room to work with. Also, I wouldn't bother with the wire jumpers. You can make your own with solid wire. (Cheaper and any size you want!)"
3,"Breadboard works great, the wires are lacking though","I bought this for an arduino class I was attending. The breadboard was more than adequate. I found the wires to be lacking. They were hard to insert, and lacked grips for the end like others. The solid wire made them a little harder to work with too."
4,Decent piece for the money,"The little plastic pieces which need to be installed for the voltage posts could be molded to fit a little better... They don't fit as well as they should, given the rest of the board and support is made so well."
3,Watch out for the titles,"The Young Duke series has taken existing B westerns of John Waynes, changed the titles, digitized and colorized them. For collectors it's not correct. If you just want to see the Duke in the old days, they did a good job re-making the old film."
2,"Be ProActive, save time & don't buy this book!","I found this book to be of little use. It's written in a style more reminiscent of self-help books rather than professional books, it it very basic and banal in it's examples (with sayings like ""give me a fish and feed me for a day, teach me to fish and feed me for a lifetime"" - come on!) and even contradicts itself on occasion (""There are only A and C salespersons, no B's"" and then on the next page states that B sales persons make up 50% of the company""). Another problem is that the author does not go into details about the sales techniques he outlines (and denotes with ridiculous names... be ProActive, measure ProActively, create M2O/t (Measurable Mutally Agreed upon Objectives over time), use the S.O.S. Pyramid, implement PowerHour, Do or Really Do). Lastly, the tips he does give are so basic they should already part of your common knowledge, even if you don't work in sales - which I don't."
3,Not really what I though it was about...,"I'm in retail sales management. I bought this book based on the glowing reviews only to find that most of the book wasn't very helpful in the retail aspect of sales management. I'm still giving it a 3 though because the chapters on hiring, managaing time/people and corrective action definatly made up for my dissappointment. I also found that a lot of the information in this book told you to perform certain actions, but not HOW to perform these actions. Overall, DONT get this book if your expecting retail sales help."
3,"Not bad, but don't place too much faith in Sales Gurus","Good attempt at writing about sales management, and Skip makes some very solid points in the opening chapter. He points to the need for Leadership as a key element of a good sales manager. Unfortunately, I think Skip knows more about sales than leadership, himself, so he is not great at explaining HOW to be a good leader. He spends a lot of time on how to hire good people, which I agree is important. This might lead some rookie sales managers to fall back on the excuse of inheriting weak sales reps, and worry more about replacing them, than fixing them.Read the first chapter in a book store somewhere, and save the $$$"
3,"soup to nuts, but very rudimentary","Has chapters for the entire Sales Manager life cycle, from vision/culture to interviewing/hiring, to corrective action. Very basic and rudimentary rather than theoretical such as you'd find in sales management course texts. Maybe this is all that's necessary to gain the big picture rather than dealing with various minutia."
5,Outstanding Tool Set for Sales Managers,"I found the book very good from someone who has done both sales and sales management. The thing I liked best about the book is the tool box concept. As a manger, you don't have to change what you're currently doing, but you may want to adopt some of Skip's tools.As far as the comments of one reviewer, giving the impression that fixing a salesperson is better than replacing one doesn't seem to know much about management or people. 40 years of Gallup research shows that people don't get fixed and they don't change. As manager's of any kind, it's our duty to put people in the right positions, even if that means it's not sales."
4,"Inca Quena, by Inti Raymi","Edgar Villarroel and Maria Victoria Cespedes are afficionados and virtuosos of the music and instruments of the historical native people of the Andean altiplano. These artists are devoted to preserving and performing traditional music as well as composing music emulating it, playing only pre-hispanic instruments.Of the 10 tracks, Kusga Quilla (Half Moon) and Llaqui Phuyo(Sad Clouds) are particularly evocative, as Mr. Villarroel reveals the expressive intonation and subtle vocality of the end-blown Andean wooden flute, or quena. The number of instruments skillfully played by these two, combined with the balance, timing and spontaneity of their vocal expressions in performance is a joy to experience."
4,Phil Ochis aother time,"A different Phil But entertaining never the less and, all ways including sideways, I enjoy his music. Worth my buck !!"
2,middle strap blocks upper keys,"I had Krusell for the treo 600 and it was perfect as can be. I bought a case for the 750 and the strap in middle of the case blocks use of the keys. I returned the case and something similar came back. The phone just won't fit properly. The leather is nice and the back holes are nicely placed for the phone. The front strap arrangement is the problem, the case was badly cut and sewn."
2,Case Needs Work,"In spite of other negative reviews of this case for my Treo 680, I gave it a try any way. Unfortunately, as with other users, the case I was sent did not line up well at all with the necessary cut outs on the phone.The merchant, on the other hand, was gracious and quick to respond to my problem. I decided to try another treo case in the same product line, and the replacement case works great! Great merchant, but watch out for the case."
1,Just Death,"Read the synopsis for this one and thought it would be a little different from the usual B-Movie tropes. The rumored Edison invention that would supposedly allow communication with the dead is a somewhat unique idea for a movie. Being a veteran of low-budget films (i.e. ""The Asylum"", ""SyFy"" movies of the week, Roger Corman movies), I thought I was prepared for what I would see. I was wrong. Production values are off, even from other movies of its type. The lighting is really bad which makes the sets look bad and in turn makes the whole thing look like a cheap soap opera. The ""globe-trotting"" of the master criminals (as per the write-up) is unconvincing to say the least. Story wasn't too bad for this kind of movie, but most of the acting is cringe-worthy to say the least. The ""found footage"" at the beginning of the film is sort of fun and could have been added throughout the movie as exposition. Have to advise to only watch this one to howl at its badness."
4,Old but content is 1st rate,"Like watching locker-room tapes 30 years ago. This is classic football footage. While the technology to produce a cleaner product now exists, the content of this VHS tape is complete."
5,Humans encounter a living planet,"A group of Quakers reach a distant planet, encounter the sentient hrossa, and work out a way to live in peace with these beings. Then they must deal with a second group of humans arriving (non-Quakers) who do not have the same penchant for peaceful co-existance. I found the study of Quaker process in an alien place a delightful unearthing of the human spirit. The hrossa are a sexy lot, and their effect on humans is fun to observe. My favorite part, however, is the unfolding of a new, dynamic, and (not so) alien theory of evolution. If peace and cooperation are your thing, you'll enjoy participating in the world of Penterra."
1,Could not finish,My review title says it all. This was not interesting or readable. A shame because the premise was interesting.
4,Manic Depression Can be Tackled,I want to congratulate Frank Bruno for being open about his manic depression. Bruno writes about it with sensitivity and honestly and i am sure this will go on to help other manic depressives. As a manic depressive myself who has not had an episode for 5 years and does not envisaging having another one i know how difficult it can be to be honest about such pain. Bruno is as gutsy off the ring as he was off it and he comes across as someone who learns by his takes and can inspire other people. Well done Frank.
5,A Surprising Resource,"More than a trivial pursuit of Bible artifacts, this book is a gem that connects the reader with key components that draw us a little closer to the people and cultures we read about in Scripture. Through it we encounter the genius of God who weaves lives and events of eras and civilizations long past together with ours. The approach is fresh, condensing a reference library into bite sized pieces, while making the information accessible to anyone who wants to get in closer touch with the message, the people, and history of the Bible."
3,Doesn't stink,"A cute story that follows a little skunk as he bravely counts his way through the deep, dark forest from ""1 masked face"" to ""10 stars"" twinkling while he sleeps.The rhyming text is a bit repetitive but will make it easy for beginning readers and will make a good audience participation book for story times. The title-based plot is lost a little through the second half of the story, but the story still flows nicely.Accompanying illustrations are cute and the animals are expressive. Even though the skunk is brave in the face of his fears, there are no scary illustrations to turn youngsters off.Counting and numbers one through ten are covered and often use unusual items."
1,Does not accurately reflect Zuni,"Rodanas story may have appeal, but analysis of her retelling reveals many errors and over-simplification of a story that has great meaning to the Zuni people."
5,Finally!,"I lost my 24 yr old son 6 weeks ago and a very good friend sent me this book. I have been given several books, but this one was so special. I could read it in 10 minutes..it made sense..it knew what I was feeling and it was ok. I cried again, but when I finished the book my heart was uplifted and my pain eased. Now, I respect the grief I am going through and know it is OK to feel what I feel."
5,Great find!,"A dear friend gave me a copy, (by copy I mean photo copy) of this book five years ago when my father passed away. When another friend's father recently passed away, I looked up this copy wishing I knew the title, author or even what the cover looked like. It was so comforting and helped me out so much I wanted to pass it on. After searching on Amazon for quite a while, I finally found it! I can't believe it. This is such a great gift when your own words seem to fail. I bought five!"
2,"Rick and Tom of Cheap Trick cut their teeth here, and you can always do worse than this 1969 release","Fuse was the 1969 release of Tom Peterson andRick Nielsen who later made up 2/5's of CheapTrick (Jon Brant, another Bassist later factoredin when Cheap Trick REALLY took off in the '80's).This is worth having if you can convert it todisk or cassette. ""Crusin' for Burgers"" is myfavorite here. Check it out. You can always doworse for 'Trick - Does ""Woke Up with a Monster""ring a bell? How about the awful (*) ""Tom Petersonand Another Language""?! Sorry, you're about to eat..."
3,"Good Twine, but no way it is heavy duty","Bought those for a kite building day. Although we didn't end up doing the day, I tried out this twine by myself. I don't believe it is suitable for big kites in strong winds. It is not suitable for that, I would guess it will snap in a heart beat. For small kites it's ok, but buy the Nylon string for heavy duty use."
4,on target,"This film hits the mark from the opening scene with explosions in a crowded part of the city. As the film's villians are out in force and wreak havoc on the town killing several people including the star's fiancee.It only excels and continues throught out the picture and while it is over 2 hours the time goes by and the action continues. With several fights between the main characters and the villian who's a couple notches above the heroes and gives it to them on every occasion. It feels like the actors/actresses had a great time doing this movie as it shows throughout with all the energy and back story. You should also check the special features on the dvd for some deleted and extended scenes of note that didnt make it into the final product.But overall this one is worth the price of admission and then some. It might not be the best out there. But the folks at Dragon Dynasty know how to make a slamfest, knockout action movie.Invisible Target hits the mark!!"
3,eh,started off great ran out of energy about 2/3 thru lousy ending great villian! hard to recommend altho i did like the 1st half and the fighting
1,What a Rip Off!,"The description says, ""It includes a two-volume textbook, a workbook for learning the mechanics of Urdu writing, a comprehensive teacher's manual, and an audio cassette.""I only received the first book! Where's the rest of it? I'm extremely upset that I did not get what I ordered. The description is deceptive! I want the product, or I want my money back!Signed, Unhappy Customer."
3,A Lively but Disorganized Noel,Having played poker for a living I really wanted to like this book. It is written in a kind of stream of consciousness which is boht its biggest weakness and it's biggest attraction. The author does a good job of showing the endless monotony of playing poker for a living and the ups and downs a player has to go through. He describes many characters in the book. Some of these characters seem true to life but the book would benefit from some tighter plotting and a better editing job. Still I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to those interested in the poker lifestyle.
2,Not really a novel.,"It says ""A Novel"" on the cover but this is book contains no plot or any attempt to create a common narrative thread. It is just a series of poker stories. Don't expect anything more."
2,"No plot,no point to the vignettes,little character developmt","I kept reading to the very end, expecting that there had to be something here. There is not. The vignettes are not really stories, because nothing particularly happens, ever. I only gave the book two stars, instead of one, because there is a little character development. If you liked Yardley,'s ""Education of a Poker Player,"" you will hate this book. They are both collections of autobiographical anecdotes, but ""Shut Up and Deal"" is told through a drugged-out, self-centered, life-is-meaningless haze."
5,For people who know or want to know,"Shut up and deal is a unique book that provides players of all skill levels a constant reminder that the philosophy of luck is as important to learn and understand as all of the ""how to and statistical calculation"" books ever written about poker. It does so in one book that also stands out as entertaining poker fiction. The underlying truths provide what it takes to win at playing poker at the highest levels and the pitfalls that are there everyday to test any player that has chosen to make poker their profession, or who have chosen to play semi-pro. I understand that to a literary critic, this book rambles, but to players who have been there it is a must read."
5,Atmospheric...,"This is the best novel ever written about poker. It effectively captures the mood, atmosphere, characters, and What-day-of-the-week-is-it?/Is-it-morning-or-night-outside? mania of the subculture. It is a mood piece that creeps very close to the real experience-- probably better than anyone has ever written it. Those looking for page-turning plots (which would otherwise blur/undercut the central theme here), need to grab some generic title off the best-seller list."
4,Good book if you know poker,"I picked this book up because I was getting interested in poker. The first time I read it, I didn't know what was going on. If you have never played Texas Hold'em, it is hard to follow. Then after playing in casinos and learning the game, I reread the book, and thought quite a lot of it. The author has a distinct voice. It is also a book about much more than poker(imagine a wired stream of conciousness Holden Caulfield playing highstakes poker), but you really need to have a grasp of poker to get it. I will probably read it again, and by then I will may think it deserves the fifth star."
5,One of the nicest perfumes at an affordable price,"Years ago, I had a friend who used this fragrance. As a male, I liked it. The scent isn't overpowering, and a little goes a long way. Recently, I purchased some as a gift for a relative. She really likes it, and after experiencing her using it, I like it too.In my opinion this is a more subtle fragrance than many women wear, and is easier to be near. If you want to smell nice, but not overpower, this could be a choice to consider. It made a great gift."
3,My First Highlander Book,"I am an incredible fan of the tv show, and this is the first Highlander book I have read. One major difference is the plot is at no time set in modern times. The evil immortal is an interesting character, and new levels of ""The Game"" are explored. Overall, I'd say the author is mediocre, and hope that other Highlander authors do better."
3,Least favorite of the books,"This is my least favorite of the spin-off novels that have been written in the Highlander legend. The book tended to drag in several places -- it could probably have been a lot shorter with no loss of plot.On the plus side, it did have both Duncan and Connor in it, and an intriguing premise for the bad guy, Khordos, who really believed himself a God, and did not follow the Immortal Rulebook.On a whole, I would say you should skip this one, unless you're an absolute die-hard fan who just can't find enough Highlander out there to satisfy him/herself -- like me!"
2,stick to the buying the tv shows,It's slow as christmas. Connor popping up ever couple of chapters saves the book from getting 1 star. This is my first highlander book.It pretty much sucks.I'll buy the shows before I buy anymore of the books. These books were wrote for money not fans of the show. Don't waste your money like I did.By the way the jason henderson's writing blows donkey.
5,One of Jesse's Best Performances!,"Great movie that is close to Jesse Eisenberg's best performance (right next to the Social Network). The story, script and entire movie is excellent. I am very surprised that I have not heard more about this movie...this is a must see!"
3,Next Live Show,"It is a movie of contemporary New York (well, sstory-time is 1998), in which a young generation of the Orthodox communities embraces a ""main stream"" avenue-seeMendy, for instance, a bit traditional tale of good boys praying and bad boys bedding.Based on the true story, a film somehow discloses a way of life and inevitable changes a third millennium brings about to a Hasidic lifestyle while making money on drug trafficking is a trend, as understood, according toMendymentioned already."
5,Fine effort from newcomer Kevin Asch,"There are lots of reasons I enjoyed this film. Jesse Eisenberg never fails to be a natural in any film, and here he gives a straight-forward version of a young man who wants to ""improve"" himself. Based on actual events, it's quite an intense account of Jewish culture, and how far this guy thinks he'll go before being found out. Justin Bartha is known for his smarmy comedic performances, and he uses that smarm to create a most unpleasant individual. I will not blab the plot, if you don't already know, but first-time director, Kevin Asch, creates a sense of impending doom that still manages to catch you off-guard. It's a very Indie film, but production values are exactly where they need to be. I was impressed. Jesse Eisenberg is a natural. I've been impressed with him for years, since his smaller role in ""Cursed"". He's not to be taken lightly as a A-List actor."
3,Holy Rollers,Anti-climatic movie featuring Hasidic drug smugglers. The whole thing was very slow-moving and the only saving grace was Jesse Eisenberg's awkwardness that fit his role perfectly.
4,Excellent performance by Jessie (Zuckerberg) Eisenberg,"In Holy Rollers, Jessie Eisenberg (who most folks know now as the actor who portrayed Mark Zuckerberg in the movie The Social Network) plays a Chasidic Jew who over time becomes less devout and turns to a career smuggling Ecstasy into the US from Amsterdam. Not only does he do the smuggling himself but he also recruits other Chasidic Jews to do the same. This movie is based on a true story from the late 90's where Chasidic Jews smuggled over 1 million pills into the US. Eisenberg, who is Jewish himself, gives a great performance alternately varying between his Chasidic background and his new drug runner status. An Orthodix Jew myself, I thought that with the exception of a few pronunciation errors, that they portrayed the Chasidic community fairly accurately. Overall a very good movie worth seeing."
2,Nothing New,"This was a decent movie but it is stereotypical when it comes to films about drugs. Everything has been done a million times and the only difference was the Jewish spin on the story.You got the naive guy who is mislead into selling drugs, ends up liking the money and attention and soon becomes one of the major players.Whether it was a true story or not, it's something many have seen elsewhere. The actors were good and the film was okay but if you're looking for something beyond a movie full of cliche's, keep looking."
3,"modest, expected more intensity","of course i thought of ""blow"" when watching this movie,but where ""blow"" was not afraid to push the emotional drama, ""holy rollers"" is quite modest. jesse shows promise as an actor. I watched this movie hoping for more character development, especially with sam's family - but it is all slightly short and the end is rather bland. i'm left wanting more."
4,Good movie,"I liked this movie. I watched it with friends from my temple. We each seemed to have varying opinions of it. I, being retired law enforcement of course saw it differently then others."
1,Not a translation of the original,"There is now a full translation from the Persian of this work by Jay Crook published by Great Books of the Islamic World (2 volumes, 1003 pages). Field's translation is a very abridged version translated from Urdu. If you really want to read the Alchemy, get the Crook translation."
2,Kindle edition - no interactive content!!!,"This is a review for a kindle edition. I'm not rating the content, as it is considered to be a classic work in the field of Islamic Studies and an absolute must for every student in this field, whether he/she agrees with the content or not. The reason why I gave it 2 stars is because it has more than 1000 kindle pages and no interactive table of content. That means it won't let you click on a heading of a chapter from the table of content to get straight there. Previously I bought another kindle book of Ghazali ""On Gratitude and Patience"" and was very pleased with the ease and simplicity of its navigation."
5,The Alchemy of Happyness,I found this book to be very enlightening and insightfull. It is a must read for every muslim who wishes to learn how to attain happiness in their deen (religion)and in life. Imam Ghazali uses the principles of psychology as a basis for understanding the hadith of the prophet (saws). Wonderfully written and educational.
5,Good brew pot,"I'm glad I went with stainless, particularly this one for the price. The bottom does not scorch, the cleanup is easy, and the construction is very good. It is shorter with a larger diameter than many I've seen but it's working our for the best. My immersion chiller diameter is based on a 5 gal bucket and it fits perfectly in this pot with ample room (a few inches) around the outside to promote really good heat transfer.I just installed a weldless 1/2"" kettle valve and now the brew pot is nearly complete. Thinking about a brewmometer."
5,Looks and feel great.,I bought this pot to brew beer. I need to make 5 gallons and this unit gives me plenty of head space to prevent mix from boiling over. Interestingly enough the price was cheaper on this one compared to a 20 quart one.From the beginning you can see and feel the quality. I wanted one that had the handles riveted instead of spot welding.Even though it came packaged in a double box it had small ding on the bottom rim. not big enough to be a problem. Came with instructionwill update review after my first batch.
5,Built like a TANK,"Using this for home brewing and maybe at some point a big old pot of Chili, but its really a nice unit."
1,Fake Perfumes,"I have used Fifth Avenue by Elizabeth Arden before, it used to be good. So I brought it from Amazon when it was in a good deal. The fragrance of the brought from amazon doest last for even 10 min. This is the first and the last time I am buying perfumes from Amazon.My $5 Body mists lasts longer than this.I brought 4 perfumes from Amazon 2 CK, 1 Azzaro and 1 Elizabeth Arden all are same. Its a complete rip off."
4,highly recommended,"I've had this a little while and had forgotten about it. While rummaging around this am, getting ready for work, I took a chance and sprayed on my wrist and forearm. One is always taking a chance wearing a fragrance for the first time to work, as many, if not most, are ""too much"", loud and offensive. I almost forgot about it but kept smelling pleasant whiffs throughout the day - ah yes, that's me!! Just right, floral, clean and classy lady, perfect for work type fragrance. Lasting power I feel is good- I can still smell it a little some 9 hours later.I like it more than ""Pleasures"" although it's along the same line, but cleaner. The price is unbelieveable. No office-appropriate perfume would be a 5 star for me:), but this stuff is very close to perfect."
4,so so,Bought this for my mom. She loves it and want only this perfume for her repeat orders! Great service from Amazon. Product is genuine.
2,A bit disappointing,"Inspector Bone has long been a favorite of mine, so I was looking forward to ""Hunter's Quarry"". However, the mystery never captured my interest, and the characters were rather one-dimensional. Given the previous winners from the Stacey duo, I expected more."
4,Fun cozy British mystery,"I've been reading all of their books this winter, and I enjoyed this one in the series. Personally I think they only get better over time. The mystery is a bit confusing at times, but the characters are great fun and it moves right along."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I recently bought two 25 bundle packs of these blank dvd's. I have literally thrown out half of the discs of the first pack due to ""bad media""- they will not allow data to be recorded onto them. I have now started on the second bundle and am having the same problem- out of four that I tried to record on so far, I had to discard two! I contacted Philips about this problem several days ago via email and have received no contact whatsoever from them. Very poor quality discs- I will not buy their discs again!!"
3,Nice for the price but can't get it to lay flat,"The rug is nice for the price. It's pretty thin and not the kind of rug that you want to sit on or play on with your kids. It also has a somewhat synthetic feel to it. However, if you're on a budget it is a very good value for the price. Mine had some small flaws where the colors weren't quite right. It wasn't bad enough though to go through the hazzle of returning it. The main problem I have is that I can't get it to lay flat. I had it for 3 weeks now and thought it would relax and lay flat eventually. So far it still has plenty of ""waves"". I uploaded some pictures to show the problem. I have another rug from the same collection and the same seller and that one lays flat and has no flaws. I guess there is some luck involved.Update: after several more weeks and turning it several times the rug finally lays flat."
5,Great rug,"Purchased both the tan and black rugs with identical designs - great! Needed an art deco/art nouveau design and finally found an inexpensive answer with these rugs. With additional padding underneath, these rugs have held up well so far. Considering a matching runner! Shipping was free and quick."
4,I YOU LOVE COMICS OR KEVIN SMITH,"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IMAGINE THERE ARE TWO WORLDS OF CHASING AMY. THE EVENTS GOING ON IN THE MOVIE AFFECT OTHER PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO KNOW PEOPLE...JAY AND SILENT BOB. WE SEE THEM BEFORE THEIR MEETING WITH HOLDEN AND CARRIES TO THE BEGINNING OD DOGMA. I ADVISE YOU TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT!"
1,1 Month Later and still NO BOOK!!!!,"I bought this book a month ago, I still have not received the book and it is 8 days past its delivery quote.I sent an email a week ago and still havent had a reply. They gave me a fake package tracking number and a window that opens saying ""we do not have anything to do with TEXTBOOKSNOW. Please do not contact us for tracking their packages.""I would not recomment their services ."
5,"Great case, very convenient","This case holds my DS (original), several games, charger, and earphones. There's room for much more. It's sturdy, closes tightly, has well-made latches, and looks nice.Awesome case."
2,I'm not happy with purchase or product,"One of the flood hoods was rather banged up and dented or arrival.The light in one promptly blew when turned on. So, I replaced it with a 100 watt bulb. One of my worst purchases ever!"
4,Good Protection / Hard to Apply,"So I picked this thing up at target (came with 2 films and a cloth).I cleaned my PSP and followed the instructions. I had a bubble or two. So I had to peel it back and get the air bubbles out. Made one of the corners a little wonky, but it works as promised. I can't notice any weird distortions or prism effects. Just look for bubbles before you go pressing it down and securing it to the PSP. The film is rather thick, so you wont have too many bubbles (i had 2). Just peel back and smooth it out with the little card that came with it.At the end of the day, it's a screen protector for 8 bucks -- and it does a good job. You should still buy a hard shell case for your PSP too!"
1,Worst Product Ever,"This is the worst product ever. It screws up the screen and has lots of bubbles. The instuctions are vague and useless. I just bought it, tried it, and ripped it up. Save your money on food. The only good that comes out of this product is the cloth. I would recommend the HORI screen protector for PSP. It has great reviews and doesn't trap dust. I am upset Pelican, normally your products are worthwhile but you definitly screwed up with this one."
5,Works Great!,This screen protector works great! People complain that you need to keep it free of dust. This is true. You need to clean the screen really good. All you need to do is use the provided cleaning cloth and maybe even get a can of compressed air to blow off any remaining dust. Than follow the directions on the box EXACTALLY as it tells you. I had no problems with it at all. If you are a teenager and are having trouble just ask your parents for help. Once applied you could not ask for anything better. It will save your PSP from any scratches and keep the screen free from fingerprints. The screen quality does not change with the exception of maybe being a little darker. It is really not noticeable though. It greatly reduces glare and that is a major bonus. All in all a great purchace. I highly recommend buying one. I hope you all enjoy it's added protection as much as I do.
1,THIS THING SUCKS IT PIXLATES THE SCREEN AND IT TRAPS SO MUCH DUST UNDER THE DARN THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,DONT BUY THIS PLEASE YOU WILL NOT WANT TO WAIST YOUR !) BUCKS ON THiS PIECE OF CRAP IF YOUR WORRIED ABOUT SCRATCHING THE LOVLY SCREEN BUT A CASE FOR IT NOT A SCREEN PROTECTOR OR AT LEAST A DIFERENT SCREEN PROTECTOR THAT IS NOT THIS BRAND I REPEAT DO NOT BUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!thank you and have a glorious day
1,A great way to ruin your PSP!,"If you are completely satisfied with the clarity of your PSP screen and feel that you don't deserve such clarity than, by all means, buy this product. It makes your screen seem pixelated and gives it a weird rainbow-like meshy color. This is the most cost effective method of actually degrading the quality of an item you paid $250 for. Way to go Pelican!"
1,wow,"wow, Ruined my expensive PSP, Air Bubbles do not come out, I Can't belive this. I hate you Pelican!!!!"
4,Decent,"This is a fair quality screen protector. Although it makes the screen a little dimmer, it does a good job of protecting it. i couldn't stand to have the screen of my PSP scratched!(...)"
3,Excellent if you can get it right the first time.,"I managed to put this product on my PSP almost perfectly. However, I the slightest bit off center, and, having a bit of ocd (don't worry about this, the film is the perfect size for the screen), decided to pull it off a day later to try and redo it. That was a 5 dollar mistake.It is very easy to get lint on this product after the initial installation. Though, I did get a bit of use out of it for a day, as I mentioned. It doesn't distort the picture at all. You won't even notice it's there... assuming you got it right the first time."
3,protects againts scratches but affects picture quality,Application is fairly simple and it offers a fair amount of protection but the PSP's picture quality suffers. The screen gaurd effects a kind of prizm affect on the screen turning fanominal picture quality into sub par clarity. The before and after application is kinda like comparing a high-end LCD big screen to a cheapo bargain brand version. It all comes down to a trade off. If your willing to sacrifice picture quality for protection then this is a good product; if not then either look for a different screen guard or just forego the whole thing all together.
3,Not Long Lasting,"Unfortunately, these particular batteries have not lasted as long as the same brand that I have purchased locally. I'm speaking of the first two pacts of four that I purchased and used so far. Typically, I can expect 8 or 9 days before the battery goes dead. So far, with these, they have lasted only 5 or 6 days. I don't think it is me, because I have not changed my pattern of usage. Could be just a bad lot!"
3,Too Much Filler on this DVD,"I'm a big fan of the Brainy Baby DVD series after purchasing both Left and Right Brain for my 21 month old son. He loved both of those and thought we should move to the ABC DVD. He already knew the entire alphabet at 18 months. This video has a lengthy song in the middle that seems to be just filler to hit the 45 minute mark. For the most part, my son loves the letter parts, but loses interest in the songs. Certainly not a regretable purchase but this DVD does lack some creative elements that were in Left and Right Brain."
4,Does what you'd expect.,"The product is okay quality (better visually than the dated ""Your Baby Can Read"" series) and it holds my baby's attention. He's fairly picky. It teaches both uppercase and lowercase letters and the phonics sounds for each letter. My baby's favorite video (which is genius) is the Leapfrog Letter Factory. But since we can't play that same video all day everyday, this one is good to alternate and he still likes it although it's much less punchy and cutesy."
5,BLING BLING,After experiencing guilt for letting my daughter watch to many wiggles tapes I purchased this video. She loves the video and i feel as though it has helped her communicate.as nelson would say - smell you later
1,Error in title...,"The title should read ""ABCs"" and not ""ABC's"". Plural does not require an apostrophe. Considering the fact that this is supposed to be an educational video, they should be more aware of such things and not make stupid mistakes in the title."
1,BAD -- Don't waste your time!!,"I can't believe this product would even get a 1 star rating. There are much better learning videos out there that are better than this one. I wouldn't waste my money or my daughter's time watching it. My 20 month old was completely bored! Please parents, don't just buy the status quo, dig deeper. There are better (check out Baby Einstein!) available products out there. Your child is worth it! --"
5,A great video,"I am a speech pathologist and was surpised by another review that complained about the repetition in this video. That is how children learn -- by repetition!! Remember, this series is designed for the cognitive and learning skills of the 2-4 year old set, not an adult! I have a 3.5 year old who barely sits still, yet the children and action in this video keep his attention. Yes, there are instrumental and singing portions, but that is what kids love. I have several in this series and my kids love them all. Both my kids learned their ABC's by watching this video (along with practicing with foam letters in the bathtub). I find the Brainy Baby series to be much more educational than the Baby Einstein videos. For those of you who feel your children have advanced beyond the Baby Einstein videos, I would highly recommend this series. Great for the preschool age group."
5,Great way to introduce and reinforce the alphabet!,"Thank you Brainy Baby for this video! I looked all over to find a quality video in order to introduce and reinforce the ABC's to my 17 month old. I began introducing the alphabet to her at age 6 months, and she now knows the letters by name and can ""sing"" the ABC song. I bought this to help reinforce her knowledge because I like that it starts out by singing the traditional ABC song several times, and then it goes into presenting each letter. I also like that it shows real life images of children and other objects, and its not just a bunch of fanciful images set to classical music. At the end, they sing the ABC song one final time. I think this a great buy for teaching ABCs, its simple and its exactly how most people would teach it."
4,hoped it would have been a little bigger,"Its a small set. The logs in the picture must only be about 6 to 8 inches, hope that helps give some idea of the actual size. It is a nice set for the money and will hopefully get to use it soon. It arrived on time."
2,Not what I expected,Very stiff and unflexible. I bought it for the celtic knot design. I'm replacing it because the stiffness is just too much.
3,Pretty but not so practical,"My 17-year-old daughter wanted a cute bag for her new laptop, and we wanted something functional. In terms of size and storage space, this bag is fine. And it is darn cute. BUT--there is absolutely NO padding to protect the laptop--just a big empty pocket. If you have a sleeve already this bag's okay and can handle your cords, mouse and accessories. But it's really just a glorified messenger bag."
2,Bad bag for a laptop!,"I bought this bag specifially for my laptop so I wouldn't scratch it or damage it. But this bag sucks as far as padding. It is nothing but a regular messenger bag, if I wanted a bag I would have got one. It's great on space but I don't use the bag because I'm scared of damaging my laptop. Now I have to invest in buying yet another bag!!"
2,Not what I thought,"It states this item is a laptop carrier, but its really just a thin fabric with no padding at all. You can't protect your laptop with this backpack like carrier. I wasnt happy with it at all! Especally bacause it cost so much, for so little. I did keep it though for use of a backpack, but it squeks when I walk bacause the clip like things are made of plasitc. Its quite annoying. I would not recommend this for a laptop carrier, but it makes a cute backpack, if you dont mind the squeking!"
4,Good Reading,"I enjoyed Pregnant Too Soon: Adoption is an option because it came from the mothers themselves. Even though the book was about your option to choose adoption it wasn't 'coloring' your mind to just adoption. It spoke openly about the three options newly pregnant women face (keep, abort, adopt). Very touching stories from the mothers. Very insightful and helpful."
5,The Crackerjack Halfback,Crackerjack HalfbackBy: Matt ChristopherThe book I read was Crackerjack Halfback. The author is Matt Christopher. A boy on the football team named Freddie Chase is having a problem. Freddie's problem is that he is afraid to tackle. Freddie knows he has to suck up his fear or he will lose his position. Now they are in a position and need to win and Freddie missed some tackles. Coach Sears knows he has to take him out of the game. Now Freddie has to try hard to gain his spot back. Wonder if he can over come that fear. I would recommend this book to kids that are worried about fears or problems they have and want to over come their problem or fear. Also kids that are truly in love with football.
4,Good deal on quality filter & pump,"Everything arrived quickly and in good condition. The equipment installed easily with the provided instructions and is performing it's duties well. This pump and filter combo is best suited for smaller shallow pools with larger pools requiring extended run times. All in all, a quality pump and filter unit that (hopefully) will deliver many years of service."
5,Carboy Handle,The carboy handle that I received is of excellent quality and worked as expected. It is made of quality materials and makes it easy to carry my CarBoy around when needed.
5,Carboy Handle,The handle came quickly and in perfect condition.I use 3 gallon glass carboys and I find the product difficult to use. It is very hard to get around the mouth of the bottle.
3,Works fine for what it is but needs more to use it properly,"Maybe this is not applicable to most or maybe I am just not smart enough to know but as I was attaching this to an antenna then inside to a computer, I found that I needed to add mounting brackets (obvious but not recommended in the listing) and lots of electrical tape for weatherproofing. I know it is nitpicky but for the price of the kit, you could expect them to include everything needed for the kit to work."
2,Not what I ordered,"The bowl I received is cute, but not nearly as cute as the bowl that's pictured above. The bunnies are completely different on the bowl I got, and the pink is very pale and washed out looking. I don't feel like going thru the hassle of returning it, however, so, just let the buyer beware."
5,my doggie loves it!,"Good topping for meals, especially for dogs that need the food softened to eat (younger and older pups), one bottle lasts about a month because you only need to put a small amount in to coat all the food"
3,really good,"I have her Mexican So fat, No Fat cookbook and I've found some really good recipes that I use often. I thought I'd try this one, and so far the recipes I've tried are really good."
4,"Wonderful Projects, Talented Artists, Poor Proofreading!!!!","This Instructional Project Book offers wonderful projects by today's renowned top artists in stamping, clay, collage, etc. However typographical errors distract from the step-by-step instructions.Xyron is one of the most ""top of mind"" brands in the Arts and Crafts industry, but was referred to as Zyron several times throughout the book. I noticed misspelled words such as Dall instead of Doll and poor sentence structure.I do not blame the author, but the Publishing House for proofreading errors. This shows lack of knowledge and details for the art form in which they are representing.When I buy a book of this price point and with step-by-step instructions I expect top-notch editing!!!!"
4,Rice' Is A Very Good Teacher,"I have taken classes from Rice' and every class has taught me something new and inspired me creatively. I'm an experienced editor and agree better proof reading was needed but her examples and information and her association with other artists included in the book are the most important reason for buying it. If her name is on a book, buy it. She has a new book coming out in October 2004 and I am anxious to buy it too."
5,"A Psychedelic, Hippie Classic from the Summer of Love!!","I'm sure glad that this movie is finally on DVD.Back when I was a kid at drive-in theater,it was the third movie on a triple feature and watching the two movies just wore me down and I feel asleep during 1967 movie not because it was boring but because I was tired so I never saw the end of it which was a mystery for the past 40 years until I bought this DVD recently.Anyway, It was fun to watch and to me anyway it should be a psychedelic cult classic from 1967 ""The Summer of Love""."
3,Not the most hard core sax,Zoot tends to want to please a wide audience. I prefer the more hard core saxophone jazz. Some selections on the album would do well in an elevator. Hey - it might be great to listen to while doing your taxes.
4,Beginners Book,"This book is used at college for helping to teach VB 5.0 in college. It is very good for newbies who don't know anything about visual tools or object oriente/event driven programming. discusses this topic in a good level of detail. It introduces the Visual Basic interface. It also teaches how to design applications, what variables and constants are, programming and looping techniques (If-Then-Else If)(do-while-loop). It also discusses techniques about accessing files (sequential and random access), error traping, and arrays. however,towards the end it introduces very poorly the power of Visual Basic when linking it to DDE, OLE and Databases. It should've stayed away from that topic. The book comes with the Visual Basic 5.0 Control Creation Edition CD."
5,Great,"This interior spray is great. It is slightly lighter than the light charcoal in my 2003 mustang but that was not a problem, as I was spraying the entire surface. If you want to do spot touch ups, I would not recommend because of the slight color difference. I would also recommend the vinyl/leather prep and a light sanding of surface before, just to have better adhesion. The company that is selling this, TCH (or something like that) is terrific. They have the fastest shipping I have ever seen and the lowest shipping rate and is delivered by FedEX."
4,The Trade,This is a very exciting and well written book. The hero is a real human. The trade in children is very moving and the ending is exciting and unexpected.
2,Okay,"On his way home to rescue his dog before the California wildfires reach his house, Matt finds a baby abandoned on the beach. Thinking to save the little girl, he takes her home, only to have her die before he can do much more. Shortly thereafter, a teen age girl, likely the infant's mother, is found dead. Matt goes to take a look at where she was found, and finds himself walking into a hornet's nest.He finds a group of run away foreign children, escapees from modern day slave runners, apparently. A good man, Matt wants to help them, even though it might cost him his life or freedom. With the help of close friends and his ex, Matt ventures into a glittering hell to save the innocent.** Although the Trade is action packed and fast moving, it's hard to build an emotional tie to the story. More details about Matt and Ginn's relationship would have made them easier to empathize with. Still, this shocking story will hold your attention. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
5,"amazing, plump, and full of vanilla beans",I use so many of these beans for my cakes anr frostings. Great Price and even better quality. I put them in airtight container for maximum shelf life. They Smell amazing too!
3,Only 16 Beans in my order,"This was the first time I've ordered vanilla beans and I relied on the product description, which states that there are approximately 27 beans per 1/4 lb.. I need about 24 beans, so you can imagine my disappointment when I found only 16 beans in the vacuum-sealed pouch. Otherwise, the beans are quite nice and the order arrived promptly and well-packed.I would recommend these with some reservation, as I expect the seller to have a closer estimate on the number of beans per pouch. If they are mis-representing this, then what else might they be mis-representing?"
4,~GOOD VANILLA BEANS~,"I have ordered Premium Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla Beans before and they were Big, Plump and Fresh. The last ones I've got, 16 in a Bag are shorter thinner dryer and not as Plump as the ones I purchased before. They are still good but the ones before were the Best. I used the 16 Vanilla Beans that comes in the bag with Vodka, 750 ML Bottle to make Vanilla Extract and also used them for Baking Desserts. Even with the drop in Quality Premium Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla Beans are a bargain over the Supermarket Prices! ...Thank You"
5,Perfect,I bought these for making vanilla extract and having on hand for baking and desserts. I'm very happy. They smell great. I was a little worried that they would dry out before I could use them (a problem I've had in the past) -- but then I realized the bag they arrived in is one of those tear-off resealable bags. Perfect!
4,Good for the value,"The beans I received were a little harder than I hoped for. They were small and there were several more than 27 included, so I knew they were on the petite side. I bought them to make vanilla extract and so far they seem to be working just fine. I'll definitely buy again. I received them two days after ordering. I had an email with tracking number 2 HOURS after I ordered so their service is fast. Overall great transaction."
5,Great Vanilla Beans,"I got these last summer to make vanilla extract and they were great - fat, moist beans with loads of flavor. The extract came out very well - the people who got it for the holidays are raving about it. I also purchased some vanilla beans at Costco during the holidays and although they were a lot more expensive, they were not as good as these. I am back from more today, so that I can continue to have great vanilla extract!"
4,Smells amazing,Ordered these beans to make my own vanilla extract. They were most and fragrant when I cut into them. I even had enough left over for some vanilla sugar. Depending on the quality of the extract when it is done I may order again. Price was competive and much better than I can get locally.
3,"good product, but maybe not as strong as other vanilla beans","I bought these because the price could not be beat. They arrived vacuumed packed and very fresh, however they dont' seem as strong as other vanilla beans I have used in the past."
2,Vanilla beans,Received timely. Okay quality. I can only compare to the expensive one's I bought at the grocery store. Using to make vanilla extract. Prefer the one's from the grocery store. These were more dried out and not as aromatic.
5,Interesting,"They smell and taste great, couldn't ask for anything better, didn'tk now what to expect but love the way they came"
5,INCREDIBLE!,"I received my beans in a day because I live in Boston and the company is located in Charlestown. I've ordered from Olive Nation (JR Mushrooms and Specialties) several times and have yet to be disappointed. This time was no different. The beans were so plump, juicy and beautifully fragrant. I couldn't be happier with them or more excited to use them. Look forward to doing business with them again. Oh, and the price! You're not going to find better. With the 20 percent off coupon code, they're 12 dollars on their website and you still get free shipping! I'll buy more beans today with the code. Only down side is that I used to be able to find Tahitian Vanilla through them as well, but there seems to be some kind of a shortage or problem with getting them from, not just olive nation, but a lot of places now. Not their fault at all. I was just saddened about not being able to find the quality beans I've been spoiled with by Olive Nation in both Madagascar and Tahitian varieties."
5,Vanillia Beans are great,"The beans arrived within4 days of ordering and the quality was great,nice plump moist beans in a resealablebag"
5,Madagascar Vanilla Beans,I purchased to make vanilla & was not disappointed with their high quality & the very reasonable price. I will definitely purchase them again.
5,Great value!,"Don't ever buy vanilla beans in a grocery store! Buy this and split it up among your more baking-inclined friends. They are so luxurious and make a great gift! I keep them in the freezer to hold in the moisture. These beans are nice and soft and contain lots of seeds. Whenever a recipe calls for extract, work in some of the seeds. The flavor will be vastly improved and the seeds lend a visible upscale touch. Excellent buy!"
2,Brainy Baby - Animals,"This did not seem like a Brainy Baby DVD. My 13mos old son loves Brainy Baby with the classical music and the cute babies, he loves to comment on the babies and point to teh screen. If you want a DVD with just shots of animals then this is proabably a good movie to get, there were lots of anuimals. But if you're looknig for a good Brainy Baby type DVD, I wouldn't suggest this one."
4,"Great, but I wish they made the animal names clearer.","This video is great in that it shows a very wide veriety of animals. However its hard for kids to pick out the actual name of each animal from the rest of the information they give on each one. I would prefer if they show the cow, say COW and then go on to tell about it. But they show a cow and go right into their speech about cows. My son didn't like it at first, but now that he's learned his animals from books, he really likes to watch it and point out all the different animals he knows."
5,"Real, interesting animals","My 17-month old son is bored with all the Baby Einstein videos, but he is delighted with this. It's a good mix of animals he recognizes and new or exotic animals. He especially likes the ""fins and flippers."" I love the real animals and the music is great too. SOME DVDs are ok for infants and toddlers, but bore older preschoolers. This one's good for kids 3-5 too, so big sisters and brothers won't mind sharing the TV as much!"
2,Informative...but definately for OLDER children,"I purchased this dvd based on all the great reviews especially b/c my daughter was beginning to outgrow Baby Einstein dvds. The first part of the dvd where there are children, animals and the Old MacDonald singing really sucked in my child and kept her interested but then all the information about all the animals told in a very ""history channel"" way lost my child's interest although kept the interest of her grandparents and my older nieces above the age of 5. So I can't give it high marks right now but I think I will be able to not regret this purchase as my child gets older..."
1,Beware there is NO power supply.,"Listing is misleading ""Aspire Black X-Cruiser Case ATX Mid-Tower Case with Clear Side, Front USB, Audio and Firewire Ports"" until you get the shipping confirmation ""Aspire X-Cruiser Case w/o Power Supply-Black (A107-1050) "".I suppose my bad for not verifying. Makes me wonder what other items from this company are misleading."
4,A moral and fun word play,"This is a cute little book, and Pinkerton the pig is a good character. The moral of the story can't be argued with. The word play of ""sandwich"" and ""Sandwitch"" is clever. I like the idea of the pig learning what it means to care for someone, too. My child got tired of it quickly; however, it's an inexpensive book. Fine for preschoolers and beginning readers."
5,awesome book,My 5 and 8 year olds love this book. It is a fun book to read. It also teaches a lesson in a humorous way. I also recommend Helen Lester's book Listen Buddy!
5,Best overnight adult diaper,I am urine incontinent and this is simply the best overnight diaper I have found.
2,Did nothing for me,"I was looking for more natural remedies for bacterial vaginosis, and after some online reviews settled on this product. I bought this almost 6 months ago and, needless to say, I didn't experience even a slight change. FYI I'm a 20-something woman."
4,Good probiotic,"This organism is reputed (Reader's Digest 2011 article) to help naturally control cholesterol, which is why I take it. Works well but may need to be supplemented with another probiotic to promote regularity."
5,have helped me so much,I have taken these to help with yeast infections and they have made a HUGE difference. Thank you for offering these at a price I can afford!
1,Didnt work for me,"Didnt work for me, i dont know if maybe i should have took the pills longer, i took the pills about two weeks - heard it was great to rid of BV which is why i bought it - had no results, i've started drinking a teaspoon and a half of apple cider vingr in a cup of water - and thats worked for me:) its cheaper to, buying this product was a waste of money for me - for BV try apple cider vingr first."
1,past expiration date,Was hoping to use a pro biotic to help me but not sure if it is when the expiration date is almost past on the product when you receive it.
3,GREAT BOOK in very BAD CONDITION,"I am sorry to say, that I recieved this book in a condition that looked as if it was used for years!Besides that - it's a great book with A LOT!!!!!! of information!"
1,Very Poor Quality,"This is the 2nd Model of Toro Valves I've used (2 Sets of 8). This Model was even worse than the first Toro model that I used, the body of which froze and fractured over winter even though they had been properly installed, drained and blown out. I paid Toro's higher than their competitor's price because I wanted a quality, trouble-free product. (My water pressure is about 100 psi; much lower than the valve's rating.) Out of 8 valves of this model, 3 diaphragms and 2 solenoids failed during the first season. To make matters worse, Toro will not supply repair parts or kits like their competition does. I refuse to ever again purchase any Toro sprinkler system or other lawn/landscaping equipment or product. I am now using totally problem-free Rainbird valves."
2,nmbound,"Valve worked until it started to leak. I called Toro Cust. service and was told they do not sell replacement parts for this item. It has a screw off top with some gaskets in it which would take 5 minutes to replace if they sold them. Now I have to buy a new valve, uninstall the old one and install a new one."
1,Waste of Money and Time,"Just installed eight of these valves. Brand flipp'n new, yet four of them leak. System clean and rings (bonnets) tight, yet, they leak (water pools on top of the valve). I've had great luck with other Toro valves (250 Series)in the past, but obviously there is one heck of a problem with this model if 50% of them leak. Will cut them out and replace with something that actually works correctly. Come on Toro! -I'd expect better from you."
2,Misleading Discription,"This is a nice book that contains a thick cardboard model of a dragon and a paperback training manual. It DOES NOT CONTAIN the tactile samples (dragon skin, etc.) or other artifacts as the discripton seems to imply. We were very disappointed in the book for this reason."
2,Not what I expected...,"Being that it is a dragonology book, I figured it would be similar to the other fabulous books. Its a cheap soft cover small book and a cardboard cutout dragon. The dragon cut out does not hand properly, its too front heavy. The book while written in the style of the other books, doesn't live up to its title."
1,Dragonology Tracking and Taming Dragons Volume 1: A Deluxe book and model set a joke,"This book is called a deluxe book AND MODEL SET. All we got was the inner book. It was supposed to have an outer book, a dragon model and the inner book inserted inside. When we got it, all we got was the inner paper back book. It was a huge disappointment. The main reason my son wanted it was for the model."
5,All becomes clear,"It seems that someone has mistakenly entered the blurb related to the original Dragonology book, which obviously does have the tactile samples, dragon dust, etc. This is a completely new book, with a superb dragon model(mobile)that you can construct. Rumor has it, too, that this is the first in a series of different dragon models that they're going to release. How cool is that!Reginald Honeyharvester - SADS : )"
5,Works as advertised. Very good product.,I bought this to clean dust and grime from old negatives and slides. It really works well. Highly recommended. Cheers!
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Reading this book is a waste of time; a review book cannot teach you how to answer multiple choice or essay questions as well as a teacher. I found the multiple choice questions on the exam to be much more difficult than the practice questions in the book. And by the way, on the back of the book it says thay it's a guide for the AP Lit exam instead of the AP Language exam."
5,5 Steps to a 5 on the A P Examinations: English Language,"Both AP English Language students and instructors need to have this text on their book shelves. Terrific review activities are useful throughout the year, as are the unbeatable introductions to rhetorical strategies, etc. The workbook sections are very accessible. Sample tests and the explanations of answers and essay ratings are clear and really prepare AP students for the exam. This book is a MUST HAVE."
1,"I want my money back, please","Overblown hyperbole passing for literature. If I'd checked it out of the library, I'd feel better. But knowing that I shelled out my hard earned cash for this sexist, racist insult to magical realism makes me angry. If the editor on this thing ever set a toe south of the Mason Dixon line, I'd be amazed. And the ending---well, it is one of the cheapest, tacked on cop outs I've seen in a long time. And in my line of work, I see quite a lot of bad fiction."
2,Good writing; repulsive characters,"I'm about 100 pages in, and while the writing is captivating, I plan to return this to the library unfinished. Why? I just don't care what happens to these characters, and I prefer not to step into their world vicariously even one more time. Circle of depressing low-lifes. Main character enacts an evil revenge on his wife, leaving her in a situation where she might be assaulted or dead, yet chapters later we still do not know what happened as a result. As a Yankee, these first 100 pages have me renewing my vows not to travel south of N.J."
4,Still reading,"A great story and I have 50 pages left. It is wacky, funny and very clever. I really like all of the characters. I did not find it sexist at all, but a bit overly verbose at times. Another edit was needed."
3,Not Funny,"This is a well written book - the author is clearly a talented writer - but... the characters are constantly drunk and/or stoned and are not particularly likeable. These folks are way too old to be getting high as a way of life. This book was supposed to be funny, and it is in places, but more often it is depressing because of the pathetic lifestyle in which these characters seem to be permanently trapped. Additionally, this is not a page turner, and I really had to force myself to continue reading to see if maybe the protagonist would eventually wise up (he doesn't). The high quality of writing is what saves this book from being totally uninteresting."
3,Needed more background,"Evers, his brother and gang of friends were drunk or high the entire story. Why? Evers was also suffering from a lack of meaning and faith in his life. I read the entire book but I still don't understand why. I needed more background to understand their motives, and more importantly to care about them. Just growing up and away from our carefree college days didn't strike me as a reason for the characters to become involved in this offbeat adventure. The book was written with care - sentences were crafted with precision - but I did sense a change in tone or 'thinking' voices. If all of these characters are inside the author's head, I guess it's no wonder!"
2,Not up to expectations,"I read this novel after reading numerous good reviews. I was gravely disappointed in the book. It was our new book club's first choice to read on my suggestion. All three women who read it were very disappointed. The situation was not of interest to women and I believe the plot was sexist. None of us could be ""hooked"" into the story and the others skipped to the end just to find out the finality. It was not worth the time to read it. Poor reading."
5,Bizarre and funny !,"...I was stunned after reading the book.It is not a ""SOUTHERNBOOK"", rather it is a wild and bizarre tale af people and theseemingly improbable lifestyle that some enjoy.It is more importantly a tale aboult family and redemption that is told in some of the most captivating dialogue I have read.I have always known that Martin was one of the smartest people I know, the book brings out his wit and insight into the human condition in a stunning manner. I would strongly recommend this book to all readers not just we in the south."
2,I Can't Recommend This Book.,"If you (like this reviewer) are not big on suspension of disbelief then this book is not for you. To me it was a jumble of main character Judge Evers Wheeling's mess of a life (past and present) which is exacerbated by his druggie brother Pascal and their ne'er-do-well friends, a woman with possible extra-human powers to grant wishes who wants him to commit judicial misconduct, quite far-fetched legal machinations going on, a muddled 10 year burglarly involving said woman's felonious brother, and a murder(or is it a suicide?). Too much! But if you like things random well then you might enjoy this read I must say."
3,Did not redeem itself,"You might enjoy this book, or you might be frustrated by it. I give this book a three star rating because it is an enjoyable read. I took away two stars because it is just so pointless! I kept expecting there to be a focus, for the characters to reveal themselves fully, for something that makes sense to happen. I guess that was my problem: I expected the book to make sense, and didn't just let it all flow... like the characters seemed to do."
3,Fair read,"The story line is a bit far-fetched, as are the characters. I had to make myself read this book, and that's not good. I couldn't find any redeeming quality to the characters and was constantly astounded how so much drinking and refer smoking could go on while driving and never once be detected by the cops. I need to move to NC. However, the writing is excellent...thus the third star."
1,Not a great product,I'm not sure how reliable these types of thermometers are so I don't know whether to say this one or these types are not very reliable. Either way it is really hard to get a correct temperature or to know if you have gotten a correct temperature with this thermometer. I follow the instructions and have to repeat them over and over before I get a consistent reading. I threw mine away.
5,An invaluable and ecclesiastically recommended resource,"Good research is valuable in many aspects and pursuits in life. ""Guide to Research: Finding Information in Print and Online"" is an educational guide to researching using the internet. The internet is an incredibly powerful tool with tons of information, however not all of its good. As an open media, it can be hard at times to find genuine information in a sea of opinion. Jeff Lenburg gives advice on using Google and other search engines to their full power, cautions about the use of Wikipedia, and much more. From finding the information to creating a comprehensive bibliography, Lenburg gives readers all the information they need to use the internet well, making ""Guide to Research"" an invaluable and ecclesiastically recommended resource."
3,not too bad,"As a huge fan of Jayne Ann Krentz, I was not very impressed with this book. The chemistry between the main characters starts off well, but loses something as you arrive at the conclusion. As always, the supporting characters are loveable and provide a lot of the book's charm. The story is lacking in realism (not unusual for this author) and I found it particularly difficult to swallow. But it was certainly an enjoyable read."
3,Psychic romance mind candy,"Questions: Why the needle in the red rose? What happened two month ago? Who is Darius ""Dare"" Cavanaugh? Are there really witches? How did Kimberly Sawyer get involved?Kim lives alone and she likes it that way. Somehow, living on the Northern California coast, she meets the owner of a Napa Valley winery, that is 150 miles away. We learn of Kim's wounds while growing up and Dare's international past in the import-export business. This story started out well, but the writing became cliche-ridden. It could have been exciting, with its intrigue and unconventional psychic elements, but somewhere along the line, it became derivative, routine romance-genre material.Written in 1985, it is nice to know that since then, Krentz has grown from mechanical language and characterization into a more powerful and skillful author."
2,Disappointing. This is definitely an early work.,"I was disappointed in this book. The characters start out on an interesting note (Is there some kind of metaphysical element here?) but fizzle down into a flat-line. Although Kim shows strength in her character, she wavers back and forth between accepting and rejecting Darius without really exploring either side (She accepts things too easily and when she does get mad at him, she forgives him so quickly--I don't think she really knows what's on her mind). Darius seems to have only one real character trait: bossy.All in all, I found this book disappointing. The witches' characters are also underdeveloped. Their plans for Kim are a bit far-fetched. Question: What was the reasoning behind the red rose?"
3,Recycled,"I think it was deceptive to repackage this story and sell it as a new release. I had read it before, and it is early Krentz, that is, a little melodramatic. I love all of her work, but I am more mature now, and the hokey dialogue is beyond me--and her at this stage."
3,and oldie but goodie,"This is a reprint of one of the Jane Krentz's older novels. Although I had read quite a few of her novels, this is one I missed. It is not at all ""dated"" and is still a good read. It was interesting to me, that you can see some the seeds of her newer characters in this novel."
3,"It's a reprint,,,,,,,,","It isn't so much that the book is bad, it isn't, although Krentz is a much better writer today than she was a decade ago,It's the fact that publishers don't warn you that it's a re-released book.......I hate that."
4,More From Westwood,"Recorded at Westwood Playhouse Los Angeles, November 1986 with Joe Pass guitar, David Young bass and Martin Drew drums. Instead of a 2 CD set from this engagement they offer 2 individual CDs. The other one is entitled TIME AFTER TIME."
4,the best event ever,"I rented this video before i liked because they saw the return of the Nature Boy Ric Flair, Sting and Vader put on a great strap match, and even saw Vader bleeding, and the British Bulldog made his debut in WCW that night."
3,WCW CLASIC GARBAGE THAT YOU JUST GOTTA LOVE,"Superball 3 was sloppy as h$ll, but its still classic WCW so it's expected. The White Castle of fear main event is pretty good, but the PPV intro of it is not...let me explain. Sting bursts into this production set of ""the white castle"" which looks like umm well a castle inwhich we are lead to believe Vader lives, and where Sting has come to accept the challenge in Vader's White Castle of fear. Some lame jokes are exchanged worst being Stings attempt at comedy and teh the thing blows up and the PPV begin's, which is sponsered by...White Castle hamburgers, how pathetic. Also every wrestler looks as thow they've had there luggage stolen and are wearing some of the worst ring attire ever produced. Vader flaunts a animal skin cape to the ring to give you an idea. But still its worth it."
4,terrific effective product,"Hello People,if you have small lines above your lips, then buy this product. It is the only lipline product that I have tried that actually works."
4,problem fit on antique Healthmate,"The filter is fine, but required some aggressive work with a hammer to make it fit my antique model. Compared to the previous replacement filter, this one had metal where the old one had fiberboard. I suppose this would be an upgrade, except that the designer apparently didn't consider the placement of some bolts on my 15 year old Healthmate; hence the need to put some serious dents into the filter. The previous replacement filter had the same problem, but the fiberboard had more give to it. It is my unscientific impression that the new filter is not as quiet out of the box as the previous replacement filter was (based on my 5 year old memory), but maybe it's just my machine getting older; or different room acoustics. Perhaps another owner can offer a second opinion."
3,So So Sandal,"When I originally bought this sandal I loved it. I was looking for a flat,casual ankle wrap sandal. It was fine for the first couple of wears. But after about three weeks the heel cracked and started falling apart. I am really disappointed."
2,BEAUTIFUL SANDAL & SOFT BUT..... FOR USE ONLY 3-4 TIMES!!!,I like roman style sandals and when i saw this sandals i ordered one pair Bronze size:7the material is very soft and the sole looks like with shine varnish or lacquer non-marking toes !!! are beautiful sandals very comfortable when you walk and perfect sandals only to use in skinny feet not wide feet.I used this sandals twice ( first time only in the house) and the heel is coming off because the heel is over the flat sole with glue.I think maybe glue it again...becuase they are beautiful soft and very confortable.
3,Disappointed,The hat is the only thing that fits. I can actually put the sweater on my cat its so huge. Still fun though.
3,Sweater set is cute,The hat fit great but our little ferret slid right out of the sweater. If it fit it would be great. Hoping to shrink it a little or stich it tighter.
3,hat is perfect,"Hat fit great,adjustable. The actual sweater is a little big for him,but then again he's 3 months old. Great combo tho"
4,"Great product, filter availability/price a problem","We've been running two of these units at home for six months now. The amount of garbage they pull out of the air is amazing. The unit is reasonably quiet on setting 2 and much too loud on 3. I'm not sure it is moving enough air on setting 1 to accomplish much.The only disappointment is the high price of the filters -- if you can find them. Online sources are much more reasonable, but availability seems spotty. I'm hoping this will improve moving forward."
5,Works great - read how to make them LAST a LONG time!,"These filters work great in the 3M units which are MUCH better than ionizer air filters. The big problem people have with using the air purifiers is filter replacement costs.At my Practical, Healthy Stuff blog, I detail how to make the Filtrete filters really last! Basically, you attach the inexpensive, carbon prefilters from Honeywell (available here on Amazon) to the filter with velcro tape. These carbon filters are the exact right size, and they capture larger dust and gunk, as well as filter out chemicals and odors.Oh yeah, like they say here, vacuum each regularly and you may get over a year's use from them!"
5,Filtrete Ultra Cleaning Filter,This is the only filter that fits my air purifier and I am completely satisfied with its performance. I definitely recommend it to others.
3,"Hooray for Hoppity, but please read on!","If Waldo Wigglesworth were real and alive today he'd have the entire Hoppity Hooper series restored and put out on a DVD set that does it justice. Other than we baby-boomers who remember actually watching this show on Saturday morning, it seems that nobody has ever heard of Hoppity, Fillmore, and Waldo Wigglesworth, the con man (or should I say ""con fox"" played so brilliantly by Hans Conreid.Sadly, what we have here is several full story-arc episodes that look like they came of aging 16 mm prints or video tape. No scene selection or anything. Just basically a Video Tape on disc, and with an inexplicable ""silly symphony"" type cartoon from the 1930's about a couple of donkies. What is that doing there?This is a totally amateur production, but sadly the only Hoppity Hooper out there. Someone please rescue this brilliant and ahead of it's time cartoon series from the dust heap of history before it's too late."
3,.,"A handy, helpful little reference tool, but hardly a comprehensive guide. It's also rather dated. Not a bad place to acquire general information, just understand that this is a tiny little book. Also important to note: most of this information, and last time I checked the actual text of this book itself, can be found on the internet without too much trouble. You may want to save your money and surf around a bit first."
1,I'm still sick,"Today I ingested less than the reccomended dose of calamus. What followed was a mroning of the foulest thing I've eevr put in my mouht, 6+ hours of nausea and some good old fashioned puking. Thanks, Legal Highs. My Advicwe to you: stay away from calamus, and this book, most of the other ones I've tried had no effect whatsoever."
4,The heart of Elvis Presley,"I love this dvd for the simple fact that it dares to focus on the music and not the hype around Elvis. Gospel music fed his soul and if you want to know about the true Elvis, forget all the hype and negative personal dirty jounalism and focus on the music, both what he made and what inspired him. Then you will know the true Elvis. This documentary does an excellent job of presenting the Gospel and religious side of Elvis with excellent interviews by those that sang with him on the road, on recordings and long into the wee hours of the morning, doing what Elvis loved best, singing gospels. Definately worth the money for the serious or casual fan."
5,The Spiritual Side of Elvis,"Nicely done DVD--it includes testimonies from those that should know him best--the people that worked with him for years. This DVD really helps you see past the advertising hype, the stage glamour, and the youthful hysteria for a brief look into his heart."
3,Torchlight goes Lesbo,There is only one boy/girl scene and its ok. There are 2 girl/girl scenes which are better. Jenna Haze looks good in her shower scene. There are also 2 girl masturbation scenes which are not bad. What makes this different then the usual Torchlight video is that there is plenty of full frontal nudity in each scene. Not great soft core but better then 80% of the torchlight videos.
1,Not at all what I was expecting,"I was expecting a fitted superman top, a shirt, a jacket, and glasses.It's a superman foam front, no back, with a couple inches of shirt sewn to it, and then some cloth that buttons behind the neck that is supposed to be a jacket, sewn to that, all one piece. Since the top only ties around the waist, it bows out at the sides and would require modification to look anything like the photo which I find misleading.For the same price I could have bought a full superman top and then just worn my own shirt and jacket over it. Instead I wore last years costume and threw this away as soon as I opened the box and tried it on."
1,Very poorly made,"I bought the standard size Clark Kent/Superman costume for Hallowe'en (today!) but it is way too big and very flimsy. The part that is supposed to be the ""jacket"" is very thin and looks like very used thrift store quality. The ""muscle"" part of the superman costume is very big (I'm a 42 jacket) and only has one way to tie it around the back at the bottom. It really needs a second strap at the top around the chest/back to pull it in, otherwise it just falls down below where the shoulder should be sitting due to its weight. I would not buy this again and would not recommend this to a friend."
3,"It works, if you can navigate the interface",We have a small peer-to-peer network and needed some sort of virus protection. Norton is a known and trusted name in virus protection and the price was right for the 5-User version.Once installed the interface requires some learning - it's not intuitive but works well once you learn the interface.
2,"If you like weak tea, this is for you","This tea isn't bad, it just made (to me) a weak cup. I used the recommended ""T Pod"" holder and it didn't make a lot of difference either.You can save yourself some money and use a tea bag instead. I tried it and wish I had thought of it in the first place! I got the same result but at least I didn't pay extra for it."
4,Good tea,"Quick, easy and good. Makes a better-than-average cup of tea. Provides a nice break from coffee on occasion."
2,Read the fine print,Artificially flavored. I didn't see it when ordered. Taste and color told me I had made a mistake. Stay away from it.
4,An above average book,"an interesting take on the lasombra, nothing really intriguing has been revealed except for their rivalry with the Tzimisce and an interesting take on their manipulation of the Sabbat."
1,Why can't you give a book zero stars?!?,"All I have to say about the Lasombra is that they are all a bunch of self-righteous idiots who think they are god's gift to the Sabbat. Every word you read of this book makes you want to vomit! I can't believe such arogence exists ouside of clan Tzimisce, I mean, DAMN! Not even the TREMERE are that self-absorbed. Stupider than the do-boys (akashic brotherhood), reading this book made me a worse person. Just to prove how terrible a person I am after reading this SH*T, I'm goin to play a Lasombra in the next chronicle I'm in!"
2,Never worked after packaging was thrown out,"I received 2 of these. One was fine. However, the second one did not work with the supplied battery. We thought maybe it was a bad battery so went out and bought another battery. Still no luck. This of course was after we had brought the clamshell packaging materials to our local recycling facility. We had never had an issue with smoke alarms not functioning when they were new. So...I'm stuck ordering a new one from Amazon because we already have the bracket on the ceiling."
3,Beware of battery compartment,"The enclosed instruction sheet stated that a plastic battery compartment ""clip"" needs to be removed with a flathead screwdriver in order to seal the ""battery lock"" so that the device works. I looked for this clip for 30 minutes without success, and the battery drawer refused to slide in. Finally, through sheer brute force, I was able to force the drawer until it made contact and the device started to blink. Assembly of this unit made for a very frustrating afternoon. Plus, the logic of having a ""battery lock clip"" for a device that is attached near a ceiling escapes me. Why do you have to LOCK a plastic smoke alarm that you have to stand on a chair to reach in the first place?"
3,hecho in mexico,"first one i received did not function. tried two new batteries and got the quick red lights and chirping on both. depressing the test button got no response. the exit light would illuminate at odd times with no way of shutting it off. overall impression of product is on the flimsy, cheap and plastic side...on the plus side it is battery (not hard wired) operated only and installs quite easily...returned original and its replacement (amz is excellent with returns and sending replacements out immediately) worked beautifully right out of the box...as to its longevity...it's anybody's guess...so it's pretty much luck of the draw on this unit..."
4,first alert photelectric sensor smoke alarm,I think this was an excellent purchase. I ordered three for each level of my house. I put them up right away since batteries came with them. I tested each one and found out that they went off faster than the ones that they were replacing. I like that they also include an escape light.
1,"Terrible customer support, cheaply made product","Bought a 3 pack from Costco. The detectors couldn't easily be separated from their mounting ring (came packaged that way). No instructions on this either, nor any help from the website. The company doesn't let you email them either. Threw away the pieces of junk and bought Kiddie brand. Much better."
5,Alarmingly good,"I had a dark stairway that needed a smoke detector.I couldn't find one in a big box store so I turned to Amazon.It showed up promptly and I immediately installed it.Now I feel good knowing ,if a fire starts, my loved ones can see their way down the steps and out to safety .Works great ."
4,Still have false alarms,"I have four of these networked throughout the house. When one alarms, they all sound. So when my wife is overcooking our dinner, the one closest to the kitchen goes off and then we get a symphony of sound everywhere!I am disappointed because my research showed that the photo-electric style detector tends toward less false alarms. However, I do have the one only 10 feet from the stove where criminal injustice is done to poor chickens and the smoke is definitely visible so I guess I should expect them to go off. A few quick waves with my hand quiets them up.I will say that they were very easy to network. Networking is good because if there is a fire in say the basement, you will know it sooner. Next time though I would buy the model that has a voice telling you where the fire is.Now if only they could call 911 when I am choking on the super dry chicken breasts!"
2,Too many false alarms,"Shower steam sets these off almost every time. I had to take the one at the bottom of the stairs down because every shower, even though the shower is upstairs, would set this off. The old detector never falsed in this location."
3,Very adequate,"It seems like a good product, my house has not burned down yet. This is one of those products that you hope is 5 star but you don't really know until it goes off. My only complaint is that the testing button is on top of the alarm, it's hard for my wife to reach without a ladder. You can install it with the test button on bottom but then the First Alert logo is upside down. It was easy to install and it came with batteries ready to use, so I can recommend it easily. The price was right and the shipping was fast and free."
1,Don't Buy These!,"I ordered a total of FOUR of these for our new home, spent the time to install the bases for each of them, then tested each. Not ONE of them worked. I picked up new batteries, thinking that might be the problem. Same issue - not one alarm worked. I'm amazed First Alert has the nerve to even sell these...stay away and don't waste your money. I am hoping I can get a refund from Amazon."
1,Test it before you take it home.,"Bought three of these units to replace older units. Got them home, installed the batteries and none of them worked. Took them back for an exchange, tested the replacements in the store and only one worked. Went with a different brand. I would not trust these units."
4,no scar victims allowed!,"actually, this would be flown for the next twenty years by Darth Vader until the Tie advancement. It is a replica of the original yellow(probably evolved from naboo starfigther yellow) into a new paint job curtesy of the Empiror himself. Darth Vader flew this in the first Darth Sidious missions in Episode III to ""slay the jedi"" and all thier kids too. It was used breifly in the movie but it is a cool ship. This toy like the Obe Wan and Anakin(good) starfigther are exact duplicates with some paint variations, Obe Wan's R4 and so on. merely a conjoined tie figher and A-wing(or some such) with the hexagonal fore windshield and a canopae dorsi-aft windshield. The latteral flanks are odivously to become Tie styling solar sails. The fore section is very A or V-wing style and speeder bikes use this as well. Very much a conflaguration of ideas taken from the first three movies. Education. Learn your ships. Fun, very, it is not breakable(with in reason)."
5,Great toy for the Star Wars fan,This ship is a lot of fun to display and play with. It's got a couple of movable wings that pop open with a lever. I love to run around and make whooshing noises while pretending to destroy those who aren't loyal to the Senate and Empire!
3,"Good, but not great","The Incredibles Game is fun but most of the game (about 3/4) you have to be Mr. Incredible. It got boring after awhile. You do get to play being the other characters in the game but not enough. I liked how they put video clips from the movie in different parts of the game. The levels got more complex as you went further into the game but there was usually 3 to 5 checkpoints in the level...that was helpful. There are no timely button presses and I finished the game in 3 days. It is a short and easy game. Overall, pretty good for beginners who have been gaming for a short time."
2,Promising Game That Doesn't Deliver,"When I watched The Incredibles, I remember thinking, ""That would be a really fun game."" A boy who can run over a hundred miles an hour? A woman whose entire body is elastic? Sounds like it would make for an afternoon or two of sugary superhero fun!Unfortunately, I disliked the game so much I never finished playing it. The gameplay was a horrible mixture of repetition, poor graphics, and an absurd level of difficulty. A good video game should be challenging, I know, but this game left me feeling multiple times as though I was mere moments away from developing an eye twitch.I loved the movie. I hated the game."
2,Movie Great Game Horrible,"I know how you feel about the Incredibales movie, it was incredibale but this game dismays the movie. Dash are faviorte character is forced to just run around in levels and avoid the enemys. Violet is just running around invisible. Elastigirl is probaly the best part of the game by swining around to the end of the level and the father is just beatin up bad guys. Plus the stupid voice of frozone gets kindof annoying after awhile. Wasn't the whole point of the movie about famile and teamwork and theres no I in team. Well you are all by you're self in this playing one charcter per level. Please note all movies made into games are bad"
1,Incredibles not so incredible!,"Maybe I am getting too old for these games, maybe this one just sucks! The game is some fun. Not bad really. But tthe graphics are horrible. They are blocky and the movement is jerky and not precise. The game does have some fun areas but if youre over ten, this one is way too simple and predictable. This game could have come form an Atari set up from years back! Its that bad, graphics wise."
1,Why is it rated T?????,"Why is a game that goes along with a G rated movie rated TEEN? I was going to buy this game for my 6-year-old because he loved the movie but then I saw the rating, so I won't."
5,Very good game for young kids,I liked the service. It shipped timely and it worked. Very impressed with customer service. It was done very well.
4,Glad you had it.,My son has been trying to find this game for a long time. You all were the only one who had it at a great price. We use it with our Wii system.
4,I Highly Recomend This Very Fun Game!,"I Like This Game Alot, Its Very Fun. Its Very True To The Movie And It Makes You Feel Like Your Right In The Middle Of It! The CGI Is Good. It Looks Realistic. I Think This Is A Good Game For Everyone, Young Or Old. I Have To Admit I've Never Finished It Yet (And I've Had It 3 Years!) But Im Working On Beating It Soon! I Simply Never Tried To Finish, Its My Own Fault. The Game Is A Blast And I Did NOT Stop Playing Because I Was Tired Of It. I Stopped Because I Got A New Game And I Started Playing It Instead. (You Know How It Is) But I Like This Game And It Sure Is Fun! :)"
4,very hard game,"this was an excellent game! the graphics where nice, controls were good, and most importantly it was fun. I loved the dash gameplay! There's just one thing that made me not give it 5 stars: The difficulty. This game is extremely difficult. The boss battles are so frustrating they'll make you wanna throw your controller out the window. Other than that it was great!"
5,its a breath of fresh air,Matt sounds a lot like the lead singer of Thursday (Geoff Rickly). i did happen to notice the faux-British accent(if that's what it must be called); it really didn't bother me. its a style thing i suppose. i really enjoy their unique sound as well as the courage it takes to put out a record with so little working knowledge of their instruments. that takes a lot of guts. i've been playing guitar for years and couldn't imagine putting out any recordings yet. take this for what it is and don't read too much into it.
1,eh...over rated,"my girlfriend loves M&K and I just don't get it or can't get into it. I understand that they're ""fun"" and ""dancy"", but that's as far as it goes for me. other than that, I kinda find them to be more of a typical NYC hipster novelty act. its tolerable but the thing that drives me insane is the faux british accent the guy sings with, which is way too common with acts like this. the only band/singer that gets a free pass on that is Blake from Jawbreaker/Jets to Brazil."
4,"Tastes good, but expensive","We've been making smoothies with the vanilla flavor for a month now. My daughter, who doesn't eat anything in the morning before school, will drink this in a smoothie. She's very particular about how things taste, she likes sweet things only, and this is acceptable to her. I'm happy because she's getting some protein in the morning. The rest of us drink it along with breakfast, and are very pleased. It mixes well and tastes good. I'm happy that the ingredients do not include sweeteners other than xylitol and stevia.My only complaint is that it is very expensive. The 900g for $69 lasts us for approx. one month, with 4 of us drinking approx 7 oz per day each, 5 days per week. We use one heaping scoop (30g) per day for all of us, which means we each get 6g of protein. I would like to use more, but it's too costly!"
3,Expensive...,"I purchased this product a month ago for $49.99 and now it's $69.99? It tasted OK, but I can't say it's worth the high price; there are other good protein powders available for far less."
2,protein powder,"This protein powder is just ok. It whips up to be REALLY FROTHY and BIG,..I don't like that part. I've found you cannot put it in the blender w/the fruit and milk/water. You must stir it in afterward, ever so gently., There's a little lacking in the taste also---so it's just OK, that's all."
5,"Excellent, systematic way of looking at word problems","I am taking a college-level algebra class to fulfill some pre-reqs. I really regret that my high school algebra texts never devoted a full section on word problems, as this book does. I see now that's why I never really ""got"" them. This book categorizes the problems by type and offers a systematic method of setting up each type. That's what I needed all along!The only negative about the book is that there are a couple of types of problems for which the author didn't develop a drawing or chart. That's too bad, but the book has helped me immensely overall."
1,"Not algebra, the easy part of pre-algebra","I was very disappointed by this book, as I was expecting one that actually covered Algebra I and II, not pre-algebra. In reality, it covers just the easy part of pre-algebra, that is, with strictly one variable. Compared with the excellentMath, Grade 7: 70 Must-Know Word Problems (Singapore Math), this is at least one grade lower and much wordier."
1,How To Solve Word Problems In Algebra,"The supplementary problems are very difficult .For people who are challenged in algebra wordproblems (like myself) it is almost impossible toto do the problems with any degree of success...no matter how much time and effort you put intosolving them. Perhaps for the fortunate who arestrong in this area the book is commendable but formathematical cripples, such as I, it offers very littlehelp and practically denies me of any hope to continue.In short, the supplementary problems are verydifficult, very confusing and discouraging."
4,easy to use,"I am using this with my daughter, she is in 7th grade.The level of problems are adeguate for her math studies."
5,Great book!,Great book! this helped me prefect my math skills when studying for an important graduate-level exam. Math skills increased substantially.
3,Very remedial,"If your looking for the very basic in algebra word problems, this is for you. The emphasis reminds me of pre algebra, with basic multiplication, addition, division, in a fewer steps than I was expecting. I was looking for Algebra word problems that would chellenge me in the way mind bending puzzles would."
5,A Masterpiece Among a Plethora of Mathematics Books.,"How to Solve Word Problems in Algebra is one of the great masterpieces in math literature. There is nothing like it because everything, the concepts and the step-by-steps, in the book are laid out beautifully. I've used every chapter, touching most of the word problems routinely found in any algebra textbook, on my freshman students in Algebra I Honors course. In a result, I've gotten nothing but terrific results. More importantly, they love doing the word problems, something I would never imagine for a students who happen to have either no feelings or a distaste for mathematics. I honestly want to see more books made similar to How to Solve Word Problems in Algebra for other areas of mathematics because they are the reasons why anyone can be so motivated in math and excel at it at the same time. All in all, How to Solve Word Problems in Algebra is highly recommended for anyone in mastering word problems, and no experience is necessary."
4,great book!,"This book has very nice techniques to solve math problems . However, I would have wanted more. I would still recommend it ."
3,long range scope,"Not bad for the price. I put this on a 25-06, and been shooting at 100 yd targets. Able to see most of my shots with the zoom."
2,the price should be a warning,I have had many Tasco scopes in the past but generally 4X or 3X9 and found them adequate for my use. I purchased the 6-24x42 scope to mount on my 204 Remington for Coyote hunting. When I attempted to zero the rifle I was very disappointed in my purchase. The scope is clear up to about 10 power but anything over that the clarity seriously degrades. At 300 yards on 24 power an 8 inch target is so cloudy you can barely see ring lines. Granted the bullet is very small but you should be able to see bullet hole on a Birchwood Shoot N C target at 300 yards. Sadly you can't even at 24 power. This is a cheep scope and not worth the price in my opinion. I'll pay a little more for a Bushnell any day.
4,GREAT FOR THE MONEY,"THE TASCO VARMINT SCOPE IS GREAT ! ITS A 6X24X42 MIL DOT FOR UNDER A HUNDRED BUCKS WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT . TRIED IT OUT LAST WEEK AND IT WAS DEAD ON BULLSEYE EVERY SHOT ONCE ADJUSTED, I GOT IT ON A REMINGTON 700 SPS IN .223 CANT WAIT TILL YOTE SEASON !"
3,WIll get you by until you can afford better...,"I bought this scope from optics planet for a few bucks more than here at Amazon, oh well. I bought it to mount on my Remington 700 SPS Tactical right after I got the rifle. If you only have $100 to spend go ahead and get this scope, but you will be MUCH better off saving for a bit longer and getting a Millet 4-16x TRS-1 for about $300. I have the MIllett and side by side comparison really showed me why people pay so much for good optics. When looking through both scopes at sunset I was able to see very well into the shadows of the low oak trees with the MIllett but only vague outlines with the Tasco. Also, the brightness of the tasco was inferior and the scope becomes foggy after taking the zoom up past 10x. Like the title says, the Tasco will get you by if you are tight on cash, but if you already are able to shoot, save up a bit longer and get something like the MIllett or even better."
4,Same experience,"I have this mounted on a Springfield Armory M1A and it is lightweight. Just like everyone else says, loses some clarity past 20x, but for the money, this is a good value and is more than adequate for the 250 yds I'm shootng at. The adjustable objective lense feature is accurate and can be used as a range finder with practice and knowledge of your rifle."
3,lot of information,"good book with lots of information,, good reference guide also price was right. kind of book you can read and reread"
4,Extremely well-detailed summary of the game of pool.,"I am a beginner,and I found this book very helpful. It is so detailed with history, tips, selection techniques that you don't touch a cue until chapter 10. My only suggestion would be more illustrations, especially in the aiming chapter. Lots of information, and a great value."
3,How to Grow a Young Reader: A Parent's Guide to Books for Ki,"I ordered this book as part of a group of books on how to get children to read and while I found some of the suggested reading familiar I had not realized that this book was written for the Christian family and make reference to such groups as Focus On the Family. The book was pretty evenhanded over all, but if enough information had been available for me to have know the focus of the book ahead of time I would not have purchased a reading guide with this orientation."
2,Made in ?,These were made in England until they moved to Indonesia & elsewhere. The quality is not the same and is more expensive too.
4,Be Careful During Cleaning Process,"These glasses look great and feel great. However, be careful washing/drying them. I broke three of them over the past year or so. Admittedly, I was not careful with the first breakage, but very careful with the last two breaks. In addition, we probably only use them once or twice a month."
2,Game falls short of expectations,"To tell you the truth, I was very disappointed by this game. The gameplay gets really repetative very quickly, and the plotline is the same as the movie so there's nothing new. The inability to play as more then one character at a time is very annoying, especially since the whole movie revolves around family. The levels with Violet are the worst, because she can only go invisible for short amounts of time, and the levels with Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are relatively boring. Basically, there isn't much substance to the game other than beating up the same type of bad guy again and again. Save your money for when the movie comes out, and don't buy the game."
1,"Good Movie, Bad Game","Yo this my review. I actually own the game and isn't any fun. This how it works. You start out doing some crime work and that's what you do all of this game. They could have at least made it more intresting. I will give a list of ups and downs and they are,UPSIt goes along with the story of the movieDOWNSDo nothing but fight in the game and you don't do anything elseGame is shortKeep a list of passwordsNo one really speaks in the gameGame is very boringDO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!! YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR MONEY!"
2,Not a good choice for younger kids,"My 4 yr old is crazy about The Incredibles and counted the days until his Incredibles game arrived in the mail. It was very disappointing. It is a lot of punching and being shot at and that's about it. Since The Incredibles appeal to a very large and young audience (and I know older folks too). I really thought the game would be more appropriate for younger children. It's not. My son loves Zelda, Urbz, and Mario Kart but unfortunatelythis was a waste of money and a big disappointment for a great little guy."
2,uhh...not so good,"the game is a fighting game, not so much skill but it is fun to start with. As people said, it is very repetative and basically its just whakcing the gameboy as hard as you can. Some of the characters are more fun, and it was overall pretty enjoyable, BUT!it is incredibly short. i finished it in two days, but if you add all the seperate minutes together it was probably more like two hours. i was fairly disappointed by the game, but it wasnt a total waste of money."
1,The Incredibles,Well i cant really rate this game with a awnser that is'ant made up because my mom bought this game for me on Christmas and the guy that she bought it from gave her a piece of crap 1 it freezese up on me. So dont buy it from some body because the'll jack u off.
2,This game isn't that good at all.,"I didn't like The Incredibles for GameBoy Advanced very much. It was a game where you couldn't save a file, you had to remember passwords to get to certain levels. Each level was almost the same as the last one, you fought evil, nothing else. It got boring after a while. The controls are also confusing and hard to use. Mr. Incredible moves too slowly during battle, or he moves too fast. Elsta Girl becomes a wimp and you can't fight with her at all when she runs out of strength. The battle screen isn't very good either. Often, enemies fly out of view, and you have to wait for them to come back to fight again. The game is very choppy, it doesn't flow well at all. Not much energy was put into making it, so it isn't a very fun or good game to play at all. I do not reccomend The Incredible for GameBoy Advanced to anyone, because I sure didn't like it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This game is absoultly STUPID! All you do is shoot, punch,and hurt people.I just played it for 15 minutes and I hated it. Unless you like games that all you do is hurt people and robots, don't waste your money on this awful game."
2,Not So Good!,"I have a very high expectancy for this one since incredible movie were made by ""PIXAR""- however, i truly didn't find it as fun or as satisfying as playing ""SPIDERMAN""... my most objection will be on the rigid moves of MR INCREDIBLE it's really awkward to control him,.... easier on elastic girl though.however i do find the game awkward and therefore annoying.NOTE: IN the FUTURE I BELIEVE I SHALL ONLY BUY GAME MADE BY ACTIVISION. thanks."
4,My childhood,This is the very first console game I had every played. And it was amazing.Graphics: 7Gameplay: 8Appeal: 9Nostalgia: +9000
1,#@!*$#%#$ GAME!!!,"THIS GAME STINKS!!!!! save your money,people!!! this game is dumber than a piece of celery! you have to type in passwords,so keep a list of the codes beside you at all times. plus,the passwords change!!! B( DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *pant* pant* *pant* *gasp* :["
1,Waste of money,"Fighting guns, machines, and monsters with slow moving bare fists and legs. It's very boring. Feels like doing a boring work without any pay. No fun at all. Waste of money."
1,"I AM FOREWARNING YOU, DO NOT WASTE MONEY AND BUY THIS GAME!!!","This game stinks(...) Graphics are horrible, but it IS GBA. This game has about 20 CRAPPY levels. Mr. Incredible is good, Frozone is ok, Elastigirl is half-decent, Dash is bad, and Violet stinks in this game. Maybe I would rate this game higher if you could face off against Syndrome as Mr. Incredible, or at least as Jack-Jack. Instead you have to beat the stuffing out of his pathetic Omnidroid, who is WAY TOO EASY!(...)"
5,Friendly Fly book review,What a wonderful book for young children! The thoughtful alliteration kept the attention of my young one from start to finish.
5,The Elements of Resume Style,This book has brought me successfully through a career change. But I recommend it to anyone who's even just looking for a new job.
4,A concise guide to resume writing,"A handy guide to writing concise, focused resumes that gives rules that make good sense, such as leave out redundant information, and omit extraneous information which does not positively contribute to your strengths and accomplishments. It's also much easier to read than the ""What Color Is Your Parachute"" books, although less comprehensive, so this book would be a good complement to another thicker resume book. Highly recommended for it's small size and affordable price to any job seeker."
3,Not good for writing cover letters,"I really liked how concise this book was, you can read the entire book in a day. My main complaint was that the subtitle was ""advice for writing resumes and cover letters that work"", and I bought it because I wanted a book on writing cover letters. But the section did not even address the standard 1 page cover letter about why you're interested and qualified for a position that many employers ask for. Instead it recommended writing a two sentence blurb expressing enthusiasm and leaving it at that to make it quicker for the reviewer. But I'm pretty sure that would be a quick way to get my resume immediately disqualified. Overall this book was helpful for improving my resume but if I were to do it over again I would choose a different book with a more substantial section on cover letters."
3,Resumes should not read like text messages,"I can see many of the points Bennett was making. However, his advice does not work for every industry. When I turned to page 52, where you see a one-page sample resume, my first thought was ""OMG, this reads like a text message on a cell phone"". It will not work in pharmaceuticals! In addition, Bennett constantly encourages the resume composers to list actual results. He does not elaborate on how to navigate around potential confidentiality issues. Just because a person achieved something great, it does not mean he/she can actually openly brag about it in a resume.Overall, the book may serve many people well, but it certainly offers no panacea for the more tricky resume requirements."
3,Labor of love,This is a highly detailed account of the history of American workers and their efforts to organize and improve their lives. Murolo & Chitty clearly know the material and approach it from a strongly held left-of-center point of view. Their book covers centuries and contains a treasure trove of information - as well as some wonderful illustrations by Joe Sacco. It also probably contains more different acronyms than any book I've ever read (complete with a six-page list of them).The book suffers from the fate of many general histories - it covers a lot of ground without much variety to make for more flavorful reading. It doesn't help that the authors keep insisting on reminding us that women and minorities quite often have gotten the short end of the stick; that is a recurring theme that is pounded into the ground.
5,ENO OF 2003,"Manual (aka jonus munk) has produced a few awsome records. check out his stuff on the amazing morr music label. Such beautiful electronia. Imagine Slowdive using synth instead of guitars and you get the idea.With this, his most recent release, Manual has produced a much more ambient record. This could quite easily be Brian eno at his most beautiful. Imagine ""an ending"", vibe, with 7 different tracks.if only his stuff was easier to find over here. Fans of morr music artists (mum, solvent etc) or Brian eno will love this"
4,3 Button Mouse Perfect for 3D Artists Using Autodesk Maya,"Have owned this mouse for a little less than a year now and have consistently used it whenever modeling characters in Autodesk Maya. The 3-button layout on the mouse and Maya's user interface compliment one-another perfectly. The mouse sports a matte finish with rigid or hard mouse clicks. As for the build quality, the mouse borders between average and high and is comfortable enough for a multi-hour session of modeling on a daily basis. Just remember to take breaks!"
5,Just right!,"This mouse is awesome. As a person that uses digital art programs, I have wanted to utilize programs like blender and wings 3D. It just seemed as if the software didn't work that well... as if something was missing. To be frank... what was missing was a normal, equal sized middle mouse button. Wings 3D doesn't even seem like the same program with this mouse! I modeled something simple in minutes after trying Wings 3D and this mouse together. Before, it'd take half an hour to figure out this and that... and the scroll wheel was a curse in that program. Now, wings 3D is a pleasure. After changing the preferences in blender, I tried the same, and while certainly more useable, it's not as unbelievably native as wings 3D seemed to me with this mouse.I have yet to utilize this mouse much in the operating system of os x, and haven't looked for drivers yet. All I know is that my Microsoft Gaming Mouse lost it's place in my laptop bag to this mouse."
5,Great mouse.,Tracks well... no more dirty track balls. Button response is reliable. Works great with Linux!
5,Terrific book.,"This is, in my opinion, probably the best book out there for teaching vocal technique to children. And children need it, especially today, as they are surrounded by bad vocal models in the media. If you teach choral or vocal music to anyone younger than 13, you really need to have this book, at least as a reference."
2,"Good content, bad publishing quality","I was extremely disappointed with this book as another reviewer was, not because of the content but because the quality of this book is distressing when you've just forked out round about $100.00. The light printing and flimsy, low-grade paper is the same as you would find in a cheap, paperback novel. My sister has a hardcover copy of this which she purchased years ago which is beautiful and I thought I could make the investment for my music library. Nope, I'm pretty sure this one is going back and I'm sad about that. Phillips, you did great in writing such wonderful material. Shame on you, Schirmer Cengage Learning - I can hardly believe you missed the mark so badly in matching the great content of this book."
2,"incredibly thin paper, pale printing","Content is great. However, I sent this book back because the pages were so thin that they wrinkled when I turned them. The text and photo printing looked like they used ""econo-econo-gray"" setting. Very disappointed, not in the content of the book, but in the printing and edition."
2,Pretty good basic reading for rookies,"I didn't finish reading the book because I had lost my interest in it. Notwithstanding, the contents are all good and correct. However, having worked for more than 4 years now, I've already known all the ingredients need to climb up the ladder. The problem to me is how to do it effectively and efficiently without leaving a kiss up perception, which is hardly covered in this book. However, if you're a ""rookie"", a first year employee, a fresh graduate, then this might be the book to read so that you can gain an impressive ""hello"" effect to your managers and colleagues. In fact, you could actually just browse the table of contents to get the meat of the book."
1,Disappointing,"I tried to work with this pedal for several months, but found it very frustrating. It slips all over the place!! Why does Casio not put more effort into a pedal that comes with such a nice keyboard -Privia PX-100? I later purchased the M Gear elongated silver pedal, which is wonderful."
4,Perfect for the price,"I shopped around for a pedal for my daughters keyboard and this one fit the bill perfectly. She is just learning how to play so it works out great. It is a little blocky though, but for the price it works."
2,"Works, but too light and flimsy.","This pedal came with my PX-330. It works fine as far as sustaining the notes, but it's VERY light and slips all over the place. I'll soon be getting a more substantial pedal to replace it (The M-Audio maybe?). If you're shopping for a pedal, I'd spend the extra $5 and get a better pedal."
4,"Great Sound, Good Pedal, Bad Grip","Love the pedal, its kinda hard to push down....compared to other expensive pedals. On any surface, ie: Carpet, linoleum, tile, wood, this pedal slides around. My First keyboard that i used this pedal with was a Casio LK-100. Worked fine. No negative things whatsoever. On the bottom of the pedal it has a rubbery sheet of rubber studs that were ment to hold it down....they help but don't stop it from sliding around. 4* for sure!"
2,"Does it job, with a couple of flaws.","Pros:Small and light.It works.Cons:Slides all over the place unless you have it taped down or wedged against a wall.Makes a clicking sound every time it's compressed.This pedal came with my Privia PX-130, but I quickly became tired of chasing it around the floor and upgraded to aM-Audio SP-2 US65010 Sustain Pedal Piano Style Sustain Pedal for Keyboards. Additionally, when playing at low volumes, the clicking sound it makes is noticeable distraction.If you absolutely need something small and light, or don't have room under your board for a piano style sustain pedal, this is a workable option. Otherwise, an M-Audio piano style sustain pedal at the same price seems like a no-brainer."
5,casio sp-3r sustain pedal....no problem!,bought this unit for my niece. the pedal works like a charm. does exactly what it's supposed to do. my niece is happy. i am happy. life is good!
3,Casio SP-3R Sustain Pedal,"It is a low-end pedal and performs well for the price. It will not have the feel and sound of a piano pedal, but the price and ease of carrying offset this. It is a good pedal for recreational and educational use, but not necessarily for performance standards. If you know that going in it is well worth it."
3,Does the job,"The pedal work great, the only thing is that because it is so light, it does not stay put on the floor, hence portable. But great buy for the money."
3,I don't know if its working properly.,I can hear a slight difference in tone when I play my keyboard but I think I should have spent more money on it.
4,Now my electric piano is complete!,"I had purchased a touch-response, Casio piano so that I can play music again ... and all that was missing to make the instrument complete was this sustain foot pedal. The product came in a timely manner, thank you very much Amazon! :)"
5,There is no mystery about MYSTICUS!,"MYSTICUS is a love story, a science fiction story and a tale of loss,searching and ultimately redemption! Imagine Kurt Vonnegut, John Irving and Isaac Asimov collaborating to make their collective magnum opus. If you can, then you have MYSTICUS. The main character, Ronald Shephard, DDS, must deal with the infidelity of his mother, the murder of his presumed father, the love for his unborne brother, Ricardo, and his childhood infatuation with Maryilyn Monroe. The reader sees a torn life in the late fifties travel back in forth in time as his family comes together. MYSTICUS is the story a life that comes full circle through the continium of time. An excellent read that should not be missed by all those who love to read and those who love to love!"
5,Cell Phone take Centre Stage.,"Yes, this is a wonderful and well recorded CD of serious traditional Javanese music. I am particularly impressed by the first and third tracks. All the instruments are stately and beautiful . . . . so how come the photographer of the CD cover caught the player of the large gongs, centre stage, on his cell phone !!"
5,We love this stuff...,We are almost ready to buy this one again. We use it for everything we need to wrap and it doesn't let us down. Slightly thicker than other wraps so it is a little stronger too.
1,Too small!,"I was excited to try these after hearing about the low latex odor, but i was disappointed to find out that they are too small! they are much smaller in width than regular trojan brand condoms. if you or your partner is above average size do not waste your money!"
1,Different story,"My partner and I felt these condoms were horrible!! We had to get rid of two as we were both having trouble putting them on properly although we never had trouble like this with other Trojan condoms. Then two others broke on us. We thought the first one that broke was just an unlucky occurrence, but twice?? I don't care how good they feel if they cannot serve their main purose-to provide protection-then there is no point of using them!"
2,best Roger Simon book -- for what it's worth,"This was better than the other Roger Simon books I have read (e.g., Wild Turkey). It's still pretty boring though."
4,Time For The Church to Wake Up,"The ""Power of One Christlike Life"" will challenge you to look differently at the world around you.Francis Frangipane leads the reader through the scripture and gives the example of how Christ treated those he came in contact with.If love isn't your motivation to reach the world for Christ then you need to look again at the one who started Christianity.You may get a little tired of the many scripture references Francis uses but there will be no doubt when you're done that what he's trying to get across is grounded in scripture.I especially enjoyed the brief biographical sketches at the beginning of each chapter about contemporary christians and it gave me hope that I too can change the world around me for Christ."
3,"Very ""Text"" Bookish","I was disappointed when I received this book. It is a ""text"" book. Very dry. Being fair, there is good information in it if you can stay awake long enough to read it,chapter by chapter! I did learn there is more than one kind of skunk (mofeta) - that was amazing! For a college student, this book is perfect. Had I been able to thumb through it prior to ordering it, I would not have bought it. This will be heading to our local library!"
4,book,This was a very good read. The second book & I'm looking forward to the next two books. These were my first experience with the work of Tom Deitz
3,"Not very deep, but an amusing period piece","I bought this book because I like science fiction with spiritual themes, a la Matrix. The premise, of God (or at least an infinite creative force) being trapped in the psyche of a man who does not realize it, seemed promising to me. However, the book doesn't really live up to the depth of the basic idea, and by the end, I didn't much care whether the entire world was annihilated or not. The most amusing aspect, it turned out, is its style: an outrageously hipped-out, over-the-top pastiche of late 60s youth culture gone bad. Imagine the Summer of Love meeting Nero's Rome and you'll get the idea. Here's a little sample: ""The sexcrucible on the cogcart supplicated, 'How long, O, Tehporp, before we can reach the Primary through His Inverse Vessel?'"" The whole book isn't quite like that, but believe me there's more than enough of it to win some sort of prize."
2,A purple hazed out fright-fest of counterculture and general wierdness,"God is sleeping inside the mind of a man that's being fought over by three forces ... two of which desire the end of known existence. If you can wade through the jargon ... it's a decent read, but nothing to write home about."
5,I love you Papere!,"This book is one of many written by my grandfather, Daniel F. Galouye. My grandfather passed away when I was a little girl and my memories of him are few and precious. I have read most of his works and have enjoyed them all. One of his books, Simulacron-3, was made into a movie entitled the Thirteenth Floor, which will be released this May. I hope you enjoy his books as much as I do. I love and miss you Papere"
5,Sea Gull Kite,Great kite lot of looks people like it and think I'm flying a real one on a string. The kite is fun to fly. Thank you!
5,"DVD is great, not sure about game???","The other reviews on here are for a game... not sure what that is, apparently it's not a fun one, but this DVD (Diego's Ultimate Rescue League) is awesome! It is very rare to come across children's movies with darker skinned children but to find one with 5 children as the 'leads' and have them all be shades of brown is amazing! I admire the fact that the makers of this DVD did not feel like they had to include a blonde/ blue eyed kid. The movie format is similar to the regular Diego episodes except it's a special 'super' adventure where they have to rescue 5 different animals to earn a 'animal rescue badge'. If your kids likes Diego, they will certainly like this movie!"
1,Let the Animals Fend for Themselves,"Who is writing these programs?!? Absolutely deficient in educational value, apart from my daughter enjoying using the onscreen keyboard to phonetically enter her name. The ""levels"" do not present a variety of challenges or formats; your child will repeat the same ""rescue"" pattern over and over and over and over...Perhaps the most annoying game ever; would not pay $5 let alone $25."
1,PEOPLE UNCUT VERSION AS ARRIVED!,"The Uncut version as arrived so if you love sailor moon go buy Season2 uncut on DVD. I have all the episodes. on tape and DVD. I ALSO WANT TO SEE SAILOR STARS DUBBED IN ENGLISH. I have the original version on VHS, but i hope we can all see the best season ever made on TV. Im a huge fan of Usagi and Makoto. THE UNCUT VERSION IS FINALLY HERE."
2,Just completed an A&P class using this book as the text...,"...and I've got to say, this book is heavy going.It was certainly my perception -- and seemed to be consensus among many of the students -- that this textbook is mediocre. Several of us in the class were also taking medical terminology in another class; about midway through the class we discovered that each of us had separately taken to using our medical terminology text (""Language of Medicine,"" Chabner) as our primary text for the A&P class also, because we all found it much more user-friendly and felt we were absorbing a lot more information than we were with this book. (And this subset of the class appeared to be doing considerably better on exams than the rest of the class as a whole.)If this is the designated text for a class you're taking, you don't have a whole lot of choice (but you might consider buying the Chabner book too, to lower your stress level!); but if you DO have a choice, I wouldn't recommend this book."
4,Early Days,"This is the 14th book in the series but it relies on some of the earliest NASA material. Because of this, some of the collected documents are not as polished as those from the Apollo years. The book is lighter on technical descriptions of the spacecraft, the booster, launch complex, etc. than previous books in the series. It does contain the transcript of the infamous news conference where the 7 astronauts were introduced. The entire postflight mission report is also provided, as well as the ""Help Wanted"" astronaut job description. The CD-Rom contains ""This New Ocean"", NASA's history of the Mercury project. Overall a worthwile purchase."
5,A great introduction to eBay selling,"This is the first book on eBay selling that you should read. The book has a nice layout that makes it easy to read. More than any other book I read, this book makes the entire process seem easy. It contains pretty much everything you need to know about selling on eBay.After reading the top eBay books, below are my recommendations:---Beginner with eBay and computers---1. The Official eBay Bible---eBay Seller---1. Sell it on eBay2. eBay Hacks---Full-Time eBay Business (not for the casual seller)---1. eBay Strategies2. eBay Business the Smart Way"
2,80% of the book contents you already know it!!!,"If you have just lunch eBay and sell some items, this book will add nothing for you!! because 80% of the book contents you already know it!! it just show you step by step how to do a specific thing like registration, leaving feedback,..etc"
3,Alright for the price.,I think for the price the apron is okay. I found one on here for $12 that is reversible that I like much better though.
5,Aside from Sookie...,"Funny, I never thought of that. Ahem.I wanted a smaller waist-only apron to hold stuff, a dish towel and my iPod, when cleaning or cooking not-that-messy stuff. (A lot of my pants don't have pockets.) This has turned out to be one of the handiest garments imaginable. I got the black one; most of my pants are black, so I forget I'm wearing it to the point where I've actually worn it to the grocery store. It's a handy, unobtrusive way to solve the no-pockets problem when you're just messing around the house, cleaning or doing whatever, walking the dog (the pockets carry treats and a plastic bag), etc. Love it.Note: From the pic, I thought this might have a tie coming off every corner for some reason (I figured I could cut the bottom ones off). It does not. It has only string ties coming from the two top corners."
4,"Not the Same, but still good","The book is well written, with plenty of recipes. It is great for someone who likes to bake & who wants a lower fat diet. The products are not the same as a high fat recipe, but they are not supposed to be. Some of the ingredients are not easily found or made, but they are tasty and very low fat."
1,Taste-Free Baking,Unfortunately the recipes I tried from this book did not taste good and turned out rubbery. I do not recommend it.
1,Didn't like it,"Fat free doesn't mean low calorie here. Nor does it mean cholesterol free. Which is an oxymoron in my mind, since cholesterol is animal fat. So how can you have fat free foods that aren't cholesterol free? I'm sure this book is helping others but for someone who was looking for low calorie, cholesterol free recipes, this wasn't the book for me."
4,"Finally, a cookbook series written by a Registered Dietician","I must admit, I am collecting all her books. As a food lover and baker, it is great to find a wonderful cookbook. Her recipes will suit the average family, not to bizarre, or requiring multiple trips to the store. Most ingredient lists are short and easy to find in the average store. I love her cookbooks."
1,I expected more from this product,"The vibrating ring didnt do anything for me... The ring is weak for me. I like to have a lil bit more vibration. But what can you expect from a lil ring. If you are into some sort of vibration than this will be great for you. But other than the ring didnt meet my standards, the delivery was fast and discreet!!"
2,sliped a lot!,"Good idea, but bad product! It slipped around a lot! Didn't reach the area it was supposed to...my area, he was too long I guess!"
1,Not received Yet,Tell this date I have not received this order nor did I get any information about it.
3,Best Whole Chicken Ever!,"I now own three George Foreman grills. This one was a toss-in with the large grill I purchased. What a pleasant surprise!I've marinated and rubbed several small whole chickens and they are simply the best I've ever made. The right-sized piece of beef is equally as good.This thing is easy to clean, has a self timer, and takes up about as much space as my crock pot. All of the grease and juices spill right into a pan below the unit.Here's a bonus, I've used the liquid to enhance chicken stocks to start soups and other meals. It comes out so rich, it is an excellent base for this purpose.Just buy it! You'll love it."
5,Great for the Motorhome or home use,"I bought this cooker mainly to use in our motorhome. However, it hasn't left my home kitchen yet. I absolutely love it. When I bake a chicken, it comes out nice and brown and still very juicy. Clean up is a snap and it is a nice size. Not so big on the kitchen counter. I would highly recommend this item."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I bought this as a Valentine's Day gift for my husband. Not only did the box arrive practically destroyed, the chicken cooker itself is broken. I have not even plugged it in to turn it on, and I have no intentions to. Please tell me how I can send this product back and receive a full refund. Thank you."
3,"ultimate dormitory cooker - but hard to clean, does break","Perfect for ""dormitory cooking"" (or any other kitchenless environment). However, mine broke after 2 years of fairly constant use.The benefits over a regular oven are pretty limited (smaller space = faster cooking). Cleanup is a pain - especially that slot in the middle where the grease drips through."
2,Returned,I purchased the contact roaster. I used it one time and returned it. It was not big enough to cook a chicken and vegetables at the same time as it claimed. The bake pan was also small. It wouldn't hold enough to feed a family of four. I would not recommend it.
5,What A Great Cooker!!!,"My boyfriend and I each have one of the larger machines and we love how great they have cooked everything. The Chickens cooked up golden brown & juicy. The Ribs, Beef, Steak, Winglettes, Seafood & many other meats we've tried all cooked tender, juicy & very quickly. Your kitchen stays cool, the fat drains into the catcher, & clean up is very quick & easy because of the non stick surface. The top pan can be used to make various things like tender steamed vegetables & fluffy rice. We've made beautiful fluffy egg omlettes using the top pan as well as baking many cakes using the top pan. the cakes come out soft, fluffy, & very flavorful."
1,Small and useless,"I bought this because I loved the George Foreman Grill so much (I own two), but the the roaster is not as good or as practical. It's a lot smaller than I thought, and I've never been able to fit a whole chicken in there. I was surprised at the size. It's only big enough to make meals for 2 people (or 1 if you're a fat guy like me). While I've found dozens of uses for the Foreman grill, It's always easier to prepare meals the conventional way than use the roaster. I now keep this in my closet... get the Grill if you haven't yet, but skip the Roaster."
5,Very juicy chicken,"I was suprised at how good this cooker is, as I was skeptical.First task: We picked up a fresh 5.2 pound chicken at the store, tied the legs together with cooking twine, and it fit perfectly in the roaster with a little bit to spare. (the larger chickens will need the legs secured, or pushed together to fit) It was jucier than that famous rotisserie on TV. The grease ran off as advertised, as it nearly completely filled the catch cup on the bottom. This is an A+.Second task: Eggs. Three scrambled eggs, peppers/onions, topped with cheese. Used a light coating of spray to coat the top tray, just in case. Closed the lid and set it for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, was nearly done, so set it for 2 more (total time 22 minutes). I couldn't believe the fluffiness of the eggs. Normally when I use a stove top pan, the bottom cooks faster than the top. This time, no burnt bottom. It slid right out of the pan, and I folded it over onto the plate."
5,George Forman Contact Cooker,"This product is worth buying. It's great for roasting meatssuch as pork chops, whole chicken.The best part is when you cookyour meat in this contact cooker all of the grease leave the potand the meat is still moist.It also good for vegetables, baconsausages. It also easy to clean."
5,Great!,"Just got this Contact Cooker today and the first thing we tried was boneless chicken breast. I fixed two in the contact grill and two in the oven. Both cooker and oven was preheated (oven to 375 degrees). After seasoning and breading the chicken breasts, I placed the chicken in the oval pan that came with the contact cooker and a pan to be used in the oven. Both pans were lined with tinfoil to reduce cleanup. I set the timer for 50 minutes. After 50 minutes, the chicken in the contact cooker had a rich golden brown color while the chicken in the oven was still a very light golden brown. Both chickens were equally tender and had good flavor. The chicken in the contact cooker was my favorite because it had better color and the crust was crispier. Next time I will do all the chicken in the cooker and forget the oven. I was very pleased with the Contact Cooker and like it much better than the contact grills. The distribution of heat is excellent. *****"
3,Decent Read,"Look at Me was far more complex than I expected, but I think the author's obvious eagerness to explore the identities of various characters in the book manifested itself in some very exhaustive yet incomplete ways. For example, Charlotte's relationship with Ellen as well as Ellen's own identity issues are introduced and expounded on in entire chapters but never confronted or resolved but for a predictable encounter in the very last pages of the book. Touching on peripheral character's issues and I thought the ending was way too neat and contained.Overall, I did enjoy the book - some parts, especially the ones that touched on isolation and despair towrads the beginning, are outstanding in their depth and clarity, but I agree with the other readers in that the book falters toward the end and seems contrived."
2,Look At Me,"It's okay ... if you like that sort of thing. Too long, too many words on a page, too much of a disconnected 80's vibe. Tediously boring paragraphs that go on and on and on about nothing much. Also, pretty hard to follow/comprehend what is happening in the story. The novel did have some shining moments, but they were few and far between. I couldn't wait for it to end."
2,didn't like anyone in this book,"This book had some interesting half-baked ideas about society, but it felt like a bunch of stories thrown together, straining for connection. I didn't really like or relate to anyone in the book, and felt vaguely depressed upon finishing it. I wish I had stopped reading in the middle..."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I could not finish this book even though a friend asked me to read it and offer an opinion.The adjectives that come to mind: cheap, sleazy, unconvincing.There are so many fine books out there. Don't waste your time on this one.I seriously question the source of all those 5 star scores...friends? relatives? the author?"
1,look at me,"Could not get into this book. Too much self examination ( I never thought anyone could do too much) but this is over the top. Did not like this book. The writing can, at times, be very good."
2,Paint by the numbers and who cares?,"I really found found this difficult to read -- in the sense that I was not engaged, I didn't care about anybody, and when there's not much plot one hopes for insight, but the insights presented here seemed shopworn and secondhand."
2,"Interesting premise, too many irrelevant twists","As other reviewers have noted, the premise for this book will draw you in. As I read it, however, I kept asking myself, Why is this has-been model's story all that exceptional since it sounds like her career was over anyway? This Internet venture is not believable! What was the point of the Anthony Halliday and Irene Maitlock characters-who get quite a bit of page time? Why even write about Ricky's cancer and his experience with the older skate kids? Why bother with Pluto the homeless man? These characters are all interesting, but in the end seem just a distracting tangent from the main story. I was waiting patiently for something to come together up until the last page of the book. As the stories seemed to want to converge, their connections were left undiscovered and the story seemed unfinished. terrible. I was disappointed."
2,Look Out,"""Look at Me"" has been very hyped, but I found it thin and disappointing and it no doubt will quickly be forgotten. Jennifer Egan is smart, but little in the book exceeds the smart-alecky. The characters are two dimensional, the ideas academic and pretentious. Egan can't surpass the limitations she is trying to parody. If you're beyond being a ""twenty something"" and engaged by the coy and by ""writing school"" pseudocraftsmanship, you should skip this novel. Even in detail, there are a number of writing errors: ""desert"" when ""dessert"" is meant, ""diffusing"" for ""defusing,"" repetitive language, that sort of thing. Hey, life is short: Read something better. I wish I had."
5,Daring and brilliant,"This is a rich, deep and subtle book. The writing is adventurous and witty, the knowledge wide. And the best of it is that it draws you on and in, with page turning anticipation, racing through worlds and connections, and never losing its poignancy. Finally it rips at the American canvas to hauntingly fortell the 9/11 tragedy."
1,Rip off price,"Look at Me: A NovelThis item is available for Sterling 1.99 on Amazon.UK, but costs 14 on Amazon.com.How can this price difference be justified? And why can't I buy it from Amazon.CO. UK as I can buy normal books, DVDs etc in this way?As an EU resident not living in the UK, I am obliged to buy Kindle items from Amazon.com, which incurs extra duty and postage in addition to the inflated price.Not happy at all about this situation and seriously considering ditching Kindle altogether if this discrimination is not resolved."
1,not for me,"Egan is a good writer, but in this book she does not transport us. It feels as though she is distracted. The research leaves a little something to be desired. Lastly, the book seems to have a need for a brand of drama that fuels the imaginations of 18 year olds. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
1,A complete waste your time!!!!!,"Don't buy this book! You can waste your money in better ways! Egan's writing style is OK - but the characters in this book are NOT at all worth reading about. They are either incredibly unbelievable or so self-centered and annoying that it pains you to read about them! Eeach time I picked up this book and read a few chapters, I kept ended up asking myself - ""WHY am I wasting my time reading this?"" Over and over, I thought it MUST get better....but it does NOT!!! I am so annoyed with myself for buying it!"
4,"Rockford, Illinios?? Are you kidding me? But it works!","Beautiful juxtaposition between urban, hip New York City and rural, Midwestern Rockford, Illinois.The story of a NY model whose face is 'changed' in a mysterious car accident, and the daughter of her best friend, a teenager in Rockford.A mystery, a coming of age, a sociological study.Terrific."
2,Disappointing,I have loved other books by Egan and was expecting more of the same. The story lines in Look at Me are disjointed. I found it difficult to care or sympathize with any of the characters.
1,Tortuous,"The book is well written and complex. I enjoyed it for the first half, but it became more odd and rambling the longer it went on. In the end I could not wait to finish it. The ending too, was most unsatisfactory. Sorry that I ever started it."
2,Too hip to bother with,"Jennifer Egan's overly-hip, self-conscious writing style was distracting enough. Add a hodge-podge of unrealistic characters and contrived juxtaposition of settings (New York vs. Illinois) and you get a book that strains to impress but never really does. Others extol her writing style, but I found it mediocre and not terribly unique. The constant switch between narrative voices and characters was not very credible to me. By the end of the novel, I wasn't terribly invested in the outcome and just wanted to finish it (to justify the expense of time and money). The characters remained remote throughout the novel, and seemed more like fairly unbelievable character sketches or prototypes (the college professor having a nervous breakdown, the angst-ridden teenager, the stylish supermodel wishing she had a brain). Perhaps Egan's other novels are better, but this one was not terribly lucid or entertaining."
2,What was the point...?,"I'm not quite sure what to make of this one. It kept my interest, but for a book that seems to be trying hard to come through with a message it's ultimately pretty empty. The characters were intriguing but there was little pay-off. I would like to have seen and understood more of Ellen.A thorn in my side throughout the book was the model Charlotte's fascination with ""shadow selves."" That just didn't ring true, for me. Charlotte was way too shallow and self-absorbed in every other way to have this single, uncanny insight into people."
2,Yikes,"I probably have no right reviewing this book as I gave up at page 100 and merely skimmed through the rest. I did not find any of these characters likeable or interesting enough to follow or care about. Furthermore, the writing style is so chit-chatty that is offputting. I loved THE KEEP but I have to say this one didn't do it for me."
2,Quite beautiful -- at first,"The story of a model whose looks and identify are severely transformed due to a car crash is intriguing and beautiful at first. But instead of focusing on her, Jennifer Egan throws in a strange Internet company, an ambitious homeless, a terrorist, the family of an ex friend, a kid with cancer -- everything but the kitchen sink. The result is bizarre and irritating and by the end, I totally lost interest."
4,I yike,"It's been a few months since I read this book but I wanted to share my positive opinion about this book since there are quite a few critiques. Even after time has passed this book is stil w/ me in that I'm still captivated by Ms Egan's writing style. She dares expose emotions and thoughts that some people likely wish they didn't have. In other words she reveals the ""under"" of the under belly openly and honestly. I wish more authors were capable of this."
3,"Worth the time, but not a classic","This book does a pretty job of looking at some of the most important issues of our time eg. identity in a consumer driven, media saturated, reality TV based society. The story is engaging, most of the characters held my interest. This is the worth the time to read it if nothing else as an enjoyable read, but for more, at times, an excellent analysis of where we are societally. Don't expect a classic. It's a place to depart to other books that explore these same themes or as part of exploring these themes in the context of other works."
1,Works Well,"I have been using the PS113 for over two years now and it works well. With the latest firmware upgrades made available on the netgear web site, performance has improved and I'm happier with it that I was initially. I would recommend the unit, but suggest checking the netgear site to make sure that your printers are on the compability list before buying."
4,A good action horror movie.!,"Is a very entertaining film, a bunch of city kids lost in the woods, most of the trama happends outdoors, the 3 killers have a very comvincing roll, a crazy one, the cold one and the indestructible one, you know the type,..he gets cut,shot etc, and still alive.!the acting is acceptable, no a lot of special effects,which better that Bad especial effects in low budget movies,. however very much achieves the purpose of the storie,.. the ending is unexpected, I think you will find it entertaining and it worth to watch."
1,Worse than Plan 9,"Title of the review says it all. IT'S WORSE THAN PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Which, according to most people, is the WORST movie EVER MADE!"
5,Incredible Game,"Truly a lot of fun. I have spent many a weekend playing this with friends, and unlike other games where it becomes convoluted with more players, this one becomes more interesting. Never have I stabbed my friends in the back and enjoyed it so much!"
5,Excellent game!,"I bought this for my son who just earned his black belt in karate; he loves it! the depictions are gorgeous, the rules are fairly easy for older children, my daughter (a purple belt!) who's nine can play without any difficulty, too! this games keeps them occupied for hours, and they've even read the booklet with the historical descriptions in it! Great fun!"
1,Couldn't Be Worse,"The Mondo Splatter CollectionThis the worst collection of three of the worst films I have ever seen. I have a collection of over 500 horror films ranging from 1919 to 2009.These three are dreadful: bad acting, bad direction, and the worst gore sfx I have ever seen. I have seen better acting in a junior high school play. Even tbe framing of the picture is way off; in the opening credits, a logo is visible, but the words are entirely out of the picture. It is also apparent that much of the picture is lost because of the crude full frame aspect ratio, not as if that were much of a loss considering what we CAN see. Bad, Bad, Bad. I think I have been robbed."
5,Keeping Up Appearances Deck the Halls with Hyacinth,"Absolutely wonderful comedic performance by Patricia Routledge and the rest of the cast. From beginning to end, Hyacinth Bouquet (spelled Bucket) keeps you rolling from one episode to the next with her zany contrivances to ""keep up appearances."""
5,"British at its best, no one does it better than Hyacinth","Funny, just plain funny, the snobs of the World should take note. Hyacinth will keep you laughing thru her journey to the upper crest, this woman would drive a person nuts if you let her. Her antics go on and on. A must for any British comedy fan."
5,a must have!,"I bought this book, at suggestion of an instructor, to go along with an heirloom machine quilting class that I took. It's an amazing book. Very detailed in instruction and ""street smart"" -- very understandable and you can easily reproduce the styles (well, with a little practice!) ...You've got to check out the wedding dress inside ... breathtaking!"
5,the newer fourth edition is even better,"harriet hargrave is a master, and continues to become even more amazing. if you are interested in machine quilting, get the next edition of this work--it includes her most recent tips, discoveries, etc."
5,A must have for any quilter's library,"I own both the most recent edition of this book and the 1987 edition. Although the newest edition is pretty comprehensive, I recently bought the 1987 edition specifically for its quilt as you go section which is not in the newer editions. I don't know why this topic was edited out but it should have been left in. Both editions have been great resources to me re: my machine quilting questions. Harriet Hargrave approaches quilting very practically and her writing is very clear. There are many photos that support what she is trying to explain in her text. If you are new to machine quilting I would recommend reading this book cover to cover because it will get you off to a great start. If you are an experienced quilter this book has some great tips in it especially if you are looking to better some of your skills or need to look at your quilting from a new perspective."
3,Probably won't fit older units.,I have a 1999 Polaris Ranger 500 6X6 and the soft top just does not fit it very well. I purchased it because the seller listed my Ranger model as one that it would fit. The roll cage on my unit is much different than the newer models so the top looks all wrinkled along the edges. And the attaching straps won't line up very well. It is better than nothing.....but not much.
2,Not worth the money,"Just ""blah"", nothing to see here folks. Pearl Jam fans will be especially insulted by Aaron Lewis's attempt at ""Black."""
3,"Aaron Lewis Cover of Pearl Jam's ""Black""","I purchased this CD for the Aaron Lewis cover of Pearl Jam's ""Black"". His version of the song on this CD is awesome. The rest of the CD is mediocre although there is some interesting music on it."
4,One Awesome Concert,"I have to say, this was one awesome concert tour. What a great line-up! STP, Staind, Linkin Park, and Static-X really know how to rock the rear off of the audience. I must admit though, Deadsy, though just another no-name band right now, has potential for more exciting things in the future. They did a great cover of Rush's ""Tom Sawyer."" The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because there are just not enough songs on the album to give you a feel for the excitement experienced from the entire concert compilation. I believe that the entire concert should be on this album, not just some select songs. Otherwise, a fantastic live album."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT KILLED MY CAT.,"I beg you, do NOT buy this product. It killed my cat. Nuff said. PLEASE AVOID ALL HARTZ PRODUCTS."
1,BEWARE!,"After using this product on my cat, he was in great pain and distress. After doing some research on it i found that it contains dangerous chemicals that should not be used on pets! I hope my cat is ok after this"
5,Fantastic product!! Does its job very well.,"I have a water fountain that is constantly in the sun and with the moisture, it's recipe for algae heaven. I got the McGravel Protec but it did nothing. Then I tried this. I found that I have to turn off the water & leave it to act of the algae stained surfaces for 2-3 hours before it will work. I have to use it every 3-4 weeks during our hot summer days in Houston."
4,The Inspirational Bible new century version the everyday Bible,The Bible was just as described It will give me many answers to different scriptures that are somewhat difficult to understand. Thank you and God bless and keep you
5,Great Version,This book is a great version. Its an excellent study bible and I needed a study bible that was New Century Version
3,Just reviewed,I just reviewed this book and may want to read it more later. I did not keep it on the kindle.
4,A sweet story...,"This is such a lovely little book. Though there're no stunning plot twists or desperate revelations, it manages to be poignant and even amusing. I think it is one of Diana Palmer's better efforts, with more depth to the characters than the average blonde-ingenue-and-brooding-rancher novella... ""Snow Kisses"" is one of those books I dig out every few months for a good re-read, and I love it every time as much as the first."
5,Lost & Found,"Haarlem by Heather Neff is a book I immediately fell in love with, as I have an affinity for deeply flawed characters. Abel Crofton fit the bill perfectly and from the moment he began his journey, I felt his pain and his discovery, the temptation and the hold of his Thirst over him as he struggled to make sense of his existence. Haarlem shows the beauty and power in facing your past before one can ever really find their way in the future and though I know it probably wouldn't happen, I'd love to hear from Abel again. Great novel Heather :)"
4,a great read,"i love reading an erudite black author -- this book shows a depth of experience, thoughtfulness and humility that manifests itself in an engaging, well-rounded story that touches on family, romance, travel, music and self-awareness. Abel Cofton is a NY Harlemite who travels to the Netherlands to find his mother and ends up on a journey of self-discovery.Ms. Neff's take on the immigrant experience (from the Caribbean to a larger country); her analogies of jazz riffs for cities; her male voice (and finally a non-brotha-bashing narration); and the easy, inimitable style, made for a mellifluous one-night stand! I couldn't put it down."
5,Listening for the Heartbeat of God touches your soul,I found myself smiling as I read the ideas in this book. The thougths are so simple and so touching without interpretations of scripture that leave me confused.
5,The importance of this book cannot be underestimated; a must read.,"This book has brought me into a closer relationship with God and fostered healing in my life. I am very grateful to Newell for his beautiful weaving of the glorious mysteries of God and the wholesome balance of Celtic Theology. If you are more interested in the institutionalized church, you may have problems with this book. But for those of us who are seeking a deeper meaning to life than the traditional church has to offer, this is the book for you. It will provide everyone with an avenue for deeper worship and possibly enable you to bring this back into your own individual church."
4,Nice,"I was very happy with this Booster Pack. It goes very nice with the Starter Deck that I have. There are a lot of nice cards in it. This is the first booster pack I've purchased, and I hope all are as nice as this pack was."
2,Misleading Book Title,This would be a good book for someone that was only interested in carriages. We were looking for information on sleighs and the book proved to be a great disappointment since it only had three illustrations of sleighs. The title is very misleading.
4,The Skin,"Good tasting jam. Good price. 13 oz, makes for a decent bite. The only problem is the apricot skins. It would be better if they pulverized them. This way it's hard to spread on your rye. Otherwise, pretty impressive selection from this French jam-maker."
1,broken glass,"Its a shame to have to write this review, because nothing is wrong with the jam. It is the best tasting apricot preserves I have ever tasted. the problem is that 4 of the 6 jars arrived broken. It was a mess. This is the second time this has happened. Amazon was nice enough to give me credit on the purchases but I wanted the jam. I would not chance ordering this again. I am amazed of the poor packaging they used to send glass jars. They didn't even have "" fragile"" or "" glass "" printed on the outside of the package.The jam is terrific, but find it in a store, don't order it."
1,Darn! 8525 PDA phone! HANGS!,i regretted getting Cingular 8525 (made by HTC)!it hangs A LOT.. AND.. now it is soooo slow!! and i only used it less than a month!!my advise.. DON'T GET THIS PHONE!wait for iphone.. or Prada LG phone!it is a waste of my money and time!i am very unhappy CAMPER!
2,album blows if you are looking for good ska,"no, I don't like this album. do yourself a favor and pick up hang-ups first. If this is your first goldfinger album, it will likely be your last. Goldfinger is a good band, just,well I like a little more ska."
4,Goldfinger's best album,"I like about half of Hang-Ups and about none of Stomping Ground (see 7 Seconds for a sweet cover of 99 Red Balloons, not Stomping Ground), but for some reason I really like this album. Probably, because there's not a lot of ska on it. My favorite tracks are Answers, Mable, The City With Two Faces, and Mind's Eye. Most of the rest are all right, but I can't give it four stars because King For A Day pretty much just sucks, and it goes on WAY too long, and by the end, it's pretty boring. My Girlfriend's Shower Sucks is stupid, and in a bad way, Miles Away is boring, but at least it's short, and Nothing to Prove is similarly boring. The last 3 tracks get back to being at least fun to listen to. So, I'd buy this used, but not new. And really, it's much more worth it to buy Walk Together, Rock Together instead."
5,It does the job,"I bought the sprinkler controller from home depot but they don't have the expansion modules available (well, i dont consider backorder available) so i found this one on amazon. It got the job done."
5,GREAT!,"It works great, drains all the fat, but if you want the charcoal/grill flavor you won't get it with this. Easy to clean up even if there is BBQ sauce burnt on, I leave mine outside and it stands up to the elements just great!!!!"
5,Fantastic,"I just bought this grill and am extremely happy with it. The first time I used it, I grilled pork chops. Eight minutes total and they were great. We'll be using this to do most of our cooking."
4,HEEEERES ACE !!!!!!!,"I am not a KISS fan so I had no bias when it came to reviewing this piece .Ace Frehley was simply SENSATIONAL . No Academy Award but the part was perfect for him and he was true to the character . The rest of the cast was average at best . The plot was clever yet at times became tired and a little dull .Overall , a HIGH 4 and well done to Mr Frehley !!!!"
3,"Good for Independent film - not great, but not bad either",The only reason why I was interested in this film was because of the cast. I love the Sopranos but they didn't get much dialog.Ace Frehley as a drug addict was not a stretch (I read the KISS & Tell book and Into The Void... With Ace Frehley book).The Director obviously used up his budget in paying the cast.
5,I love this movie,"We can't always take cinema seriously. That being said, I loved REMEDY for what it is: a film that DOESN'T take itself seriously and indulges the viewer in the sordid unkempt world of it's rock and roll characters. They screw and drug their way through a murder mystery that keeps you guessing.Ace Frehley WAS amazing as other reviewers have said, and to those with negative comments- Get a life- obviously this is tongue in cheek stuff- and it's well done at that."
1,A movie that isn't worth watching,"I started to watch this movie and I thought that I was back at work. I work in the social work field and deal with ""drug related"" problems during my work hours. I didn't like this movie at all. From the first 45 minutes into this movie the plot was totally based on people using drugs and ruining thier lives. Yes, it does tell of what happens to people that ""use"" and how your life can be messed up. I didn't need to watch this movie for that information. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about when they were reviewing this movie, but to me this isn't worth my time or money. Definately not recommended to anyone that has a brain and wants to use it."
1,Don't waste your time,"A rambling, incoherent piece of crap. 80 minutes of my life that I'll never have back. Don't waste your money, or your time, on this ""film."" They need to have a negative rating for movies like this. I gave it one star because giving zero stars isn't an option."
2,Predictable forced suspense,"I just felt like I was watching a bad late night movie the main cast was just not verry good the acting was just so cheesy and forced. I mainly watched this movie because it had a lot of Sopranos actors in it and they were good but they didn't have many lines. I won't give it away but I have to say I was not suprised by the killer to me I knew who it was for awhile and was just waiting for the conformation. Anyway I think the core actors were just to bad I love seeing Frank Vincent, Vincent Patore but didn't save this movie."
1,Not So Much!!,"This movie was extremely confusing, the plot could of been better, this movie was just very confusing."
3,needs editing,"grammatical errors were distracting but then the authoritativeness of the text became an issue when i began to find mistakes evident to anyone with an interest in history and the sea. examples: pages 251-253. the idea of crossing the ""line"" (the equator not the tropic of cancer) is improbable as is the neptune ritual. a voyage from funchal +/- 33n to barbados +/-13n would not cross the equator. page 282. braddock's death and the french and indian war occurred in 1755 not 1775, just before the revolution."
5,Rolls-Royce of Literature,"John Sugden's ""Nelson"" is one of the best books in its class; the only problem will be waiting another ten years for the second volume."
3,well done but who has the time,fun for a bit but who has the time to play these games? Obviously there are a bunch of under- or unemployed people/students who can find 40 hrs/week to level up their characters. Not as much fun if you only want to play a few hours a week.
1,frustration in the long run,Mythic makes promises they never get around too. They nerf classes to try to balance the servers. It is very easy to spend a ton of time on a character only to have it changed by mythic and made less useful. Mythic seems not to listen to customer feedback that would really improve their game and make customers happy. Pass this game up it will save you time money and frustration in the long run.
5,"Simply, Wow","Dark Ages of Camelot combines mythological fantasy with the best RPG online system ever. 3 Great realms offer classes and races to appeal to all senses. From Trolls to Firbolgs, Britons to elves, Dark Ages has it all. All kinds of interesting people play, with distinct roleplaying servers for serious roleplayers, and superior realm vs. realm servers for those who like to fight. Cold, hard realms. Warm, lush trees and lands with magnificent cities and towns are all include in Dark Ages. Uplifting NPCs to gruff, winter-hardened Migaard NPCs, It is all there. Overall, the best game I have ever played in any category, even topping Baldur's gate and a mile ahead of Everquest, Dark Ages of Camelot is worth the price and a whole lot of fun."
3,if you have nothing but time.,"The reason i bought this game was to experience the team based PvP (realm vs realm) The only problem is that if you dont play 8-12 hours a day there is no point in going to the pvp aspect because you wont be able to kill anyone. When i first started out they said you should be level 15 before you go pvp, then it was level 20, now im hearing level 30. If you have the time this would be a really cool game."
