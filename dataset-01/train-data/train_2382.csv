5,A Must-Read For Every American- Especially Parents,"Great compilation of information for busy people who don't have time to browse the net for hours or read 50 books on health. Lists types of alternative healing methods to consider instead of being victimized by the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. I have already made many of the over 100 suggestions to a healthier life and plan to add more even though I do not take prescription or OTC drugs.I don't think that the reviewers here who knocked the book read it cover to cover! The info is interspersed through the book, not given in one big list. Or maybe they are employed in the healthcare industry. The information provided is new to many people. Also has a great list of suggested reading and the online newsletter is great. Great article on microwave oven danger."
2,"A little hypocricy, perhaps?","No, I haven't bought the book, just flipped through it a bit in Wal-Mart. But I have seen the infomercial. It's hard to avoid, it seems to be on just about every channel. The one thing that struck me as strange was how Kevin Trudeau rants about how the drug companies and FDA are keeping all these amazing natural cures from the public, so they can make more money off of them. However, to find out about these natural cures, one must purchase this book, therefore giving money to Trudeau. If he was really so selflessly concerned with the health of the public, wouldn't this information be free?...Just a thought..."
1,GARBAGE DON'T BUY,"This Book is Garbage bottom line. His infomercial will have you thinking this book is filled with natural cures and remedies and its not. If you want a ""Natural Cure"" just Google it bottom line.If they had ZERO stars thats what I would rate this book"
1,fraud fraud and more fraud,no info of any magnitude just go to his website and spend more money.a huckster from way back
3,Natural Cures - Hype or Hope?,"As the author of The Healing Powers of Vinegar, Revised and Updated - I know that there are a lot of books on the market that hype up both conventional and natural cure-alls. But I believe some docs ""hide"" the natural stuff used for centuries.For instance, I had a large wart on my thumb and my doc's asst. said I had to have surgery. This was one week before a book signing. I fled the office and took an alternative route. I turned to apple cider vinegar several times a day. One week later: The wart was gone as was my trust in the expert's advice.What's more, my belief in natural cures, from vinegar for warts to exercise to zap anxiety, soared. Yeah, ""They"" Do Not Want You to Know About certain inexpensive folk remedies. If we go back to Mother Nature it will put many doctors out of business and money into your savings.The bottom line: Listen to your body first, doctors second. Patient Heal Thyself."
1,Think About It,"Ever heard of Scientology? Well I have. Perhaps you remember noted Scientologist Tom Cruise's recent rant on talk shows about the evils of antidepressants. He even went so far as to tell Brooke Shields she was sadly deluded for taking Zoloft for post-partum depression. Perhaps you've noticed Kevin's ranting about the evils of anitdepressants on all his recent infommercials. Could it be because Kevin Trudeau is a Grand Thetan in the National Church of Scientology? I've heard he funnels millions from the $2 billion his enterprises earn each year into the Church of Scientology. I don't know whether his natural cures are any good, but I think every dollar spent on them goes toward funding Scientology."
3,Has merit but content is questionable.,"I do believe he is genuine in much of what he says. I think he is paranoid and probably has some reason to be.He does tell you to change your lifestyle and for most people it isnt what they want. their still looking for more pills, or more miracles. He gives you plenty of ""things"" to do but most people arent going to do them.i decided to incorporate alot of it into my life. Yes there is no question that he keeps reiterating the same things over and over again, that he is questionable in his own life and practices, imagine , he still smokes but wont let you go near a high definition TV lol.... he has been a con man, butits the con men who KNOW the other cons.I do believe we arent meant to take all the meds we take, eat all the garbage we eat while i did get a ton of good things and ideas to do, it isnt chock full of natural cures.it will start you on the path to doing it yourself if it shakes you up enough like it did me."
1,Does anybody realize Kevin Trudeau is a scam artist?,"You can look for yourself,run his nane through a search engine and see how many different web sites give hime less than great descriptions,or enter his name at quackwatch or the Bad Buisness Bureau, in my opinion he is an evil man who preys on people despeate for hope and he offers them some, lies, for his own gain. I do know what i'm talking about I am a member of the James Randi Educational Foundation, a 501-c3 charity that promtes healthy skepticsm. I think this book is full of nonsense and lies. All of this in my opinion, and cannot be proven, but think for yourself."
1,What a ripoff,How I wish I had come to this site first. I wasted $30 plus shipping on this book and as it turned out it kept telling me to go the website beause he COULDN'T tell you about it in his book. Not without making even MORE money that is. He is right. It IS all about the money. Including how much he is making on this book. And then when I tried to load the website with the login NOTHING came up.I am SO disappointed and I hate to think of others that are not feeling well such as myself and get taken in by this book. Pay MORE money to get what I SHOULD have gotten in the first book. I don't think so.
1,I thought I could read people!,"This is the biggest lie promoted on TV. I think when he went to jail the first time it was for ""Not being a good con artist"" While in there he learned how to be a GOOD one!!! It is just a big advertisement for his web site that you have to $$$$$JOIN$$$$. I say DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!! Not one thing he says on the infomercial about finding cures is in the book. What's so funny about it is that he lists a bunch of books that you can buy that tells you this info when the whole time he says no one can write this stuff because of the FDA ETC.... You might as well call me SUCKER!!!!"
1,TOTALLY MISLEADING!!!,"I purchased this book, like everyone else, expecting to read the ""Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About."" Unfortunately all I read was about how everything we eat is poisoning us, and if I want to know how to fix it buy a subscription to his website. So I did, however when I got on the ""private member's only page"" there was NO INFORMATION WHATSOEVER. It just says that the website is still in the launching stages, and there will be more information ""soon."" So I tried to cancel my ""subscription"" but nobody has contacted me, although the automated email back to me says that someone will contact me ""in a few days."" Over a week later nobody has contacted me. Absolutly misleading, and disappointing. DO NOT PURCHASE!! I would rate zero stars if it was an option."
1,THIS BOOK DOES NOT TELL YOU ABOUT ANY CURES PERIOD!!!!,"All this book does is tell you about things that are bad for you.The author claims that the government and the FDA will not permit him to tell the reader about ANY cures for Anything! But for some reason, the author will be able to tell you all of the cures that you thought you were getting in this book on his website. FOR A $10 MONTHLY FEE!!!! How is it possible for other authors to tell you about alternative medicine, but this author can't? IM TRULY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS $35 PURCHASE. Save your money and find the information else where since you wont find it here. Im going to try to contact the author for my money back for the misleading advertising he has done in his t.v. special and in the description of this book.But I have a feeling that I wont get it."
1,Grateful for the Feedback,"Having an ""orphan"" disease for which little research is ongoing, even in Houston with its top-notch, larger-than-a-midsized-town medical center, I am constantly searching for non-pharmaceutical things that are good for my body. Needless to say I have tried lots of stuff. I am grateful for the feedback from folks who have shared their thoughts about this book. I was also tempted to purchase it after viewing the infomercial, but decided to order ""online"" to avoid the follow-up add-ons that""live"" telephone sales people try to make me buy. The website itself is a total turnoff. As others have stated, I hope you folks get your money back."
1,Natural Cures Ripoff,"The Natural Cures promised in this book seem to be missing due to the excuse that the Government will not allow him to mention them. However, for a small price you can join his website and and get all the answers you want(yea right).The worse book deception I have ever purchased. A complete waste of my money."
1,Don't buy it!!!,"This book is a major rip off!!! It only has about five pages of useful information, the rest is just fluff and fill."
2,THE CONSPIRACY THEORY LIVES,"RADICAL AND REPETATIVE. SOME GOOD ADVICE, BUT NOT REALISTIC FOR MOST OF US...FUNDING THE LIFESTYLE COULD BE A DEFINITE ISSUE FOR HIS CAPTIVE AUDIENCE. THE MOST DISAPPOINTING ASPECT OF THIS READ IS THAT KEVIN KEEPS REFERRING THE READER TO HIS WEBSITE TO OBTAIN FURTHER DISCLOSURE THAT HE IS NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS IN PRINT. THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH! NOT ONE BIT OF INFORMATION CAN BE ACCESSED ONLINE UNTIL YOU BECOME A CARD CARRYING MEMBER OF THE TRUDEAU SOCIETY, WHICH CAN SET YOU BACK ABOUT $500. NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL A RIP-OFF."
1,Beware the positive reviews!,"This book should be illegal for being hideously dangerous to your health, but the first amendment does allow this abhorrent man to publish his little book.In regards to the positive review I just read, please note that ""The Lost Reviewer""'s critique is an obvious puff-piece. Check out the other reviews under the same name of 'Kelvin' and you'll find an Oct. 11 review of the same book that is completely scathing. Hmmm...being paid to write reviews, are we? Amazon should take action on this.Only the very gullible or desperate will buy this book. I wouldn't use it as toilet paper."
1,TOTAL SCAM NO INFO IN BOOK,"This book is a 273 page printed ""infomercial"" for his website(...) There is NONE of the promised information in this book at all. Consumer Beware info on this guy is something you should take a look at before buying any of his ""wares"". I have never been so unhappy with a purchase."
2,Natural Cures you thought he was going to tell you about.,"There are many things annoying about this book; mostly it's Kevin Trudeau's JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL LIKE WRITING SKILLS. Extremely redundant, repetitive statements pollute the book and make the reader want to scream expressions of torture! The constant referencing to his own website in order to get information about these ""natural cures"" makes Kevin look like a flaming hypocrit. After all isn't that what the book is supposed to tell people?. My advice, save your money unless you find this book at a garage sale. You can get better and more clearly written information from books written by Dr. Weil."
1,Who's money is it supposed to be about?,"In this book, we are advised that the safest source of food is to eat only organic. There, keep your money.There are no secrets revealed here. The reader is repeatedly led to a website where you must be a paying member to access any further information. The tone of the author is rather insulting to anyone of average intelligence - his point is repeated in simple terms to ensure that the reader 'gets it'. This book attempts to do to the entire food industry what 'Fast Food Nation' did to the fast food restaurant chain. The author repeats the motto ""It's all about the money"" while encouraging the reader to the website where the secrets are buried beneath a credit card payment or two, which is indeed 'the pot calling the kettle black' as stated in the previous reviews given here. For $499.00 you can obtain a lifetime membership to the site as well as print copies of upcoming books and cds ""absolutely free!""Run from this one ASAP, and don't look back!"
1,have not received my books yet from NaturalCures.com,"I read the first version of the book and liked it, but something suspicious is going on with this version. I ordered three books in June from the NaturalCures.com website and still have not received them. Apparently, Mr. Trudeau does not think it important to answer my emails either concerning this matter.Not surprisingly, I cannot seem to get a hold of Alliance Publishing either. I still have the check claiming that I paid money for my 3 books (which they cashed), and my bank has tried helping me, but to no avail yet.I still very much want to read this book, but here we are almost 5 months later and I have not received my 3 copies."
5,******Great message in this book*******,Get out of my way I'm feeling great after just doing a few things in the book. I went to my chiropractor and discusses the idea of doing the cleanses mention in the book. I work in a chemical plant and in the past year I have noticed a decline in my energy and a cough started. She referred me to another doctor and he liked what he saw in the book it was pretty much what he already did. It wasn't so bad and we did things I could live with. End of the story is I feel better and my cough is gone.:)
5,Who Dont Hear Will Feel,"This book is a masterpiece. Contains very reliable information on being healthy and staying alive. Most of the claims in this book has been credited by personal doctors i know. The system needs to stop creating problems. Why distribute a product that MAY CAUSE SIDE EFFECTS? Your goal should be to cure the problem, not to create another.There is two keywords in this whole equaion, Treat and Cure. If you get medication to treat a dis-ease that means it is only making matters worst, not getting rid of the problem. Medicated drugs only treats the symptoms of a dis-ease.(Now remember a disease is only a dis-ease of the body, which with the right nutrients can come to a normal balanced ease.) Now a cure, brings the dis-eased body to a normal EASE. Basically this is what this book provides. Information that will save your life, time, and money.For those of you who wrote the bad reviews and dont feel the same way, guess what? Who dont hear will feel."
1,Didn't buy book but still got stung!,"Yes, after reading the many online comments, i just went to the bookstore and read several sections to help my diabetes, without buying the book... Well......After about an hour searchng online the natural cure of Asian Diabetic Assoc. with Dr. Yung Su Kim, I never even found his name! I got suckered into ordering some supplement called Ambrotose and then found out the one Trudeau was referring to was called DIABETICINE, but too late, I already paid $30 for another one (with different ingredients!!) THEN, as others have said, after I went to Trudeau's website where in the book it said you could get the recipe for that bread that was forbidden by the feds, you cannot! ---unless you pay to subscribe at about $71! [...]"
1,P. T. Barnum Would Have Been Proud,"Now to prove PT Barnum is right comes Kevin Trudeau. The difference is that he may be dangerous to the health of anyone who believes him. His people have obviously stuffed the ratings. Want proof? Of the latest 5 star ratings only 3 of 230 people had reviewed other books. Of the current 410 5 star ratings, 164 came within a 4 day period from September 12 through 15. Can you honestly believe it is possible to have 4 5-star reviews from Septmeber 16-20 and 164 the 4 days before that? Only a handful of the names can be verified through tools such as Switchboard, most coming back with no such name in a given city.Caveat emptor, or he'll try to show you tickets to see the egress."
1,No option for no stars?!,"I became more and more appalled as I read this book. I had NO idea who this guy was, but just picked up the book because it sounded interesting and because it is a bestseller.This is blatant scientology/dianetics propaganda!Interestingly enough, it's being sold as a ""Well-being"" book.Please! I will be returning this nonsense ASAP."
2,Scanty Information,"I agree that the FDA doesn't have our best interests at heart, as Mr. Trudeau states in his book. But this author makes claims and doesn't give you anyway to check out these claims for yourself. I.E. No resources listed. I would also say that over 75% of the information of the ""cures"" he mentions in his book points you toward his website for more information. You have to pay almost $10 a month to become a member of his website to get that information. He makes an excuse that if he put his claims in the book the FDA would take action and seize all the books, etc. One question... What would stop the FDA from shuting down the website for listing that information?It's an ""Okay"" book but Mr. Trudeau's actions of trying to get more money out of the reader at his website gives me the strong impression that ""It's all about the money"". This makes him come across as being less than sincere and truthful about his claims."
5,This book is cool I learned a lot.,I am a young teen. My mom had me read some of this book and I really learned a lot for myself. So it isn't just mom says I should eat...I have made my own dicision about eating well. I never thought I would say this but I actually like organic food better than regular food. I eat more fruit than I used to because it tastes better. We even make our own bread. Thank you Kevin for writing this book it was very educational.
1,Trudeau is a con artist,"Kevin Trudeau used to make a lot of infomercials, claiming that things like coral calcium could cure cancer and other ailments. Because there was no evidence of any kind to support these claims, the Federal Trade Commission banned him from producing any infomercials ever again. Only after this ban - after he agreed to pay $2 million to settle claims against him - did Trudeau write this book.This guy is a quack and a huckster. I have no issue with herbal remedies - only with con artists. If you're suffering from pain or disease, don't be vulnerable to those who would take advantage of your need for help.For more details, see the FTC's website:http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/09/trudeaucoral.htm"
1,Even the library warns against this book,"I work as a librarian in a very large, reputable public library system. It's VERY rare that employees are warned about the content of books in our adult collection. Well...we've been warned about this book and the claims of this author. The book is certainly not banned by the library, but the employees have been made aware of the controversy surrounding this author, so we can pass along the information to patrons. Although we are diplomatic with our words, we feel it is our duty to let people know this guy is a danger, because we care about the folks who visit our library. Like many others have suggested in the reviews here, there are plenty of other reliable resources you can reference without paying a dime."
1,Rip-off,"Author complains about false advertising, but then engages in some of the most misleading advertising himself. He states he provides cures, but you go through 12 chapters of nonsense and government bashing, to only have him tell you in the last chapter -- where he is supposed to reveal the cures -- that he can't tell them to you unless you joing his website membership, paying an extra fee. What a crock. Total waste of money. Don't buy it. Trudeau is the master of the bait and switch."
2,Natural Cures,I will never order from them again. The book looked as though it had been a dog's toy and I was charged the purchase price for such bad condition.
2,"A disappointment...Offered no viable information on ""cures""","I got this book because I was interested in learning more about health and these ""cures"" that ""they"" didn't want me to know about. Except there are no cures. This book is a long story about his life, the evil pharmaceutical companies and his fight with the FTC. It doesn't offer any health benefits, as there is no advice other than, ""Don't eat sugar,"" and ""Avoid flourescent lights."" Stupid stuff. Don't waste your money. It's a total rip off! If you want to learn about natural cures, there are many books out there that actually have herbal remedies for cancer and other sick patients."
1,Actually minus 5 stars,"What a raging hypocrite! His whole premise is that the pharmaceutical business is just a greedy scam, compromising our health to make them rich. That may well be but they couldn't compare to the deceptive bottom dweller he turned out to be. I had never fallen for an infomercial; and I never will again. I just wish I had read this forum before spending $30 for nothing. This guy is defrauding the public worse than any of the agencies he points the finger at and should be the object of a class-action lawsuit. The book gives you absolutely nothing that it promises to and anyone who promotes him any further by subscribing to the website is a bigger fool than I. I only wonder where he will find a natural cure for the malignancy of his soul."
3,ok book,I was not really that impressed with the book. Most of it was a preparation to purchase more than the book itself. You have to go to a website and become a member to get further information or do all of this expensive treatments that most people don't have the money to do and insurance may or may not pay for.
5,The natural way to lose weight,"Following the advice on ""how to read food labels,"" and ""how to lose weight effortlessly and keep it off forever,"" I have noticed my weight reduce dramatically.This book educates you on the real reasons behind the food that you eat I had no idea that the food I was eating was actually giving me a weight problem. The story about the high fiber bread in the book and the way the FDA fought it was incredible.I am sure this is just one example in our world today and I congratulate the author for opening my eyes to it. There is sound advice in this book that is ""revolutionary""to some - to me it is just common sense, once you know what is really going on."
5,Great recommendations,"I am going to follow the recommendations in this book even though it would mean a huge change in my life-style. Something that Trudeau has throughly convinced me to do after reading this book. I can see myself discontinuing medications that I currently take for high cholestorol and high blood pressure.I agree with Trudeau that American corporate culture is very corrupt. Whether the health care industry is any more corrupt than other parts of contemporary corporate life is doubtful. I think that if we are paying for health insurance, we should be able to choose between a doctor or holistic healer not covered by my insurance. In the past I have seen a chiropractor for back pain and he was totally effective. Reading the book makes me kind of want to explore more his ideas as they are intriguing and it's obvious he's extremely passionate about his views. His crusade against corporate crooks and his bravery in the face of adversity is to be commended."
1,Don't waste your money,"I gave this book one star because I had to give it at least one. I got this book today, after ordering it from the info-mercial. It will be going back into the mail tomorrow for a refund. All it does is highlight topics and refer you to his website for more information. The website requires a pricey subscription. I wish I'd read these reviews before purchasing!"
1,I need a colonic...,"cause this is crap.Bought the book at the airport in Tampa to read it during my flight to Fankfurt Germany.After reading it I left it in the seat pocket in front of me cause its not even worth the extra weight.I might agree with one thing: Americans dont walk enough!This is science fiction written by a crazy person.The part I liked the best was where he tells us about the ""secret labs that add certain chemicals into the McDonalds hamburgers to get everybody addicted and fat!"" WOWMy aunt in Stuttgart must get her ingredience for her homemade blackforest pie from this lab cause I`m addicted to IT.Wish I would've read the reviews here first before spending my 30 bucks."
1,a waste of money,"This book was a waste of time and money! It was his opportunity to sell more books. He never gave you any natural cures, just information about obvious political BS about the FDA and most of us already know how ""they"" work! He would refer to his other web sites,( you would have to pay for) to get the Natural cures. I've read better information in local comic strips! Don't waste your money! I was VERY dissapointed! I wouldn't have even given it a 1 star, I would have given it a negative 5!"
1,Disappointment,"I bought this book out of curiosity after a short portion of one of Mr. Trudeau's infomercials, to see what miracles the fellow had up his sleeves. While his descriptions lifestyle changes and food intake make a little sense, as you continue to read on, it doesn't take long to realize that his lifestyle changes are greatly unrealistic and impossible by the ""typical family"". As the book continues, I became quite tired of his ""whinning"" and obvious hatred for corporations and our government. The book as it relates to his health ideas and suggestions could have been written in about 100 pages or so, The remaining was ridiculous crying and fingerpointing. I did take the time to review other websites to see if there was any legitimacy to his contempt for ""the system"" and what I gathered after reviewing numerous neutral sites is that Trudeau has in the past, had a number of ""issues"", [...]"
1,Don't Waste Your MONEY!!!!!!!,"Actually this is No Stars. If you think this book actually contains even one ""natural remedy"" that you might be able to use, think again. There's absolutely no remedies in the book - just random statements about remedies that are not available to us for one reason or another. I.E, like did you know somebody was offered $30 Million to not release his diabetes cure. He doesn't say if he knew what the cure was, if the cure worked, if the person took the $30 Mil.Really - the only book this helps is Trudeau, he's getting rich knowing how to title a book that pushes our buttons."
1,"Wow, five star reviews every 30 minutes","Isn't that a little weird how this guy keeps getting five star reviews about every 30 or so minutes continuously? I see a conspiracy here, and it isn't the drug companies. If you're gonna read these reviews start from the oldest first to see the more legit ones."
1,0 review,"God, please don't waste your money on this rip off artist. I can't believe he can get away with this. THERE IS NO INFORMATIOM ON CURES THAT CAN HELP YOU!!!!!"
1,"Quack, Quack !!!","I must admit that I have not read this book, but dis peruse recently while in a local bookstore.As others here have stated, he gives you a lot of well-known advice about the benefits of air filters, not eating refined flours and sugars, the donwsides of smoking, the dangers of tap water, etc, but to get all the info on each subject you have to join his website (high membership fees apply) to get all the info related to each subject.He is a hypocrite of the highest order in regards to his rants about the FDA and other agencies when it comes to greed winning out over the well-being of the health of the human race !!DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK !!!"
3,Truth and half-truth...,"The grand idea of total medication of all people wrongness is absolutely correct. Unfortunately, more than half of the book is letters of acknowledgement. As to real natural cures, author sends you to other books for them, which is a usual sales trick. That is what I have expected, and that is what I got."
1,scam,"purchased the book in hopes of finding information on natural cures, instead what I recieved was nothing except how money hungry the goverment is and this most of us know because we pay taxes. In order to gain anything from this book it requires a heavy deposit in Kevin Trudeau's bank account, which I didn't make the deposit, because I figured the cost of the worthless book was enough. However; he does give you alot of web sites to visit, that is about the extent of his information."
5,Great Book! He says it like it is,"I loved this book. Kevin doesn't pull any punches and says it like it is. It is a wake up call to all of us and how we are being manipulated by our government -- like it or not. He speaks the truth. I have been using herbs for years. However, I have begun incorporating some additional things into my daily life that I read about in the book and I have noticed a change in the way I feel. This book is definitely worth your time!"
4,Good Ideas,"I am guessing that everyone else who read this book and reviewed it here doesn't have a debilatating disease. I have secondary progressive MS and was almost needing a wheelchair; doctors claim there is no turning back, no getting better when you have secondary progressive MS. I went to a naturopath who did a lot of the stuff that Kevin reccomends and now I am doing better than ever. I can't tell you enough how much you should at least give it a try.If you don't believe what he says about the FDA and FTC, that's your choice, but give a few of the ideas a chance."
3,Great starting point for nutritional conspiracy theories,"I agree with a lot of what Kevin says about not needing to take medications for everything to discover what is causing illness as opposed to covering up symptons. I love his quote ""Headaches are not caused by an aspirin deficiency"". His book is a great starting point in understanding how corporations put profits above the health of the population, fast food,pharmaceuticals,cola companies, and grocery stores. However there really is not a pay off on specifically what the natural cures are you must go to his web site for that. He is a little over the top in the conspiracy of the government not allowing natural cures to be given. AT the end he has an excellent list of books for recommended reading. That is where you will actually find specifics."
1,Wow,Anyone notice that with this latest flurry of phony 5 STAR reviews that Kevin's employees posted that his book's rating just climbed up to 3 stars??
4,Intuitively almost correct,"I psychically knew most of the information in this book. However, I do believe that not all disease and illness are caused by drugs or that all diseases are cured without the help of certain drugs. Yes, drugs are scarily overmarketed and the FDA and FTC are basically evil groups and there are very few diseases and very few drugs that actually do help cure those diseases. The problem is that this author overgeneralizes. He should try to appeal to the sceptic who has not been brainwashed by the drug companies. I'm sure there are thousands of us out there, hopefully millions! It is a good read with a lot more validity than heresy."
3,Natural Cures,"This does provide some common sense to those that have no idea on some of these issues, and may even reinforce some information to those that do. Overall, I felt it was worth reading."
1,To call this junk science is an insult to junk,"you cannot get cancer if you are alkaline?that's good to know. Oh wait, the pH of every living human is in the alkaline range ( >7 )I guess if you are packed in lime with a pH of 8 you certainly won't get cancer.Maybe I should write a book too.This man belongs in prison. I hope his cell mate gives him a ""special "" colonic every night after lights out because he is raping the ill of the world. These poor ignorant people are sending their hard-earned money which he steals. But worse, he sells false hope and what he steals are people's hopes and dreams.My only hope is that his cellmate is HIV positive.[...]"
3,Natural Cures they don't.....,"It's a decent book, if you take your time and read around the double talk. Kevin repeats himself constantly, takes up about a good third of the book. I ought to write a book!"
3,Not my fave,"It doesn't reveal much (if anything) about actual cures, just refers you to the website and more books. I was too lazy to return it but I don't really recommend it- just a bunch of fluff."
2,Pretty Hokey,"I saw this guy on an infomercial, which was pretty interesting. This book, however, seems like a big advertisement to give him more money to make infomercials. Good points, but very thin on substance."
4,a good read,"While a lot of the information is common sense, and one should be careful to not take every product out there because they think it is a ""cure-all,"" this book is a good read.He says a lot of things that other gurus are saying, and that mainstream is beginning to look at like vitamin D (remember when 300 mg of calcium was considered a ""lot"" and that anyone who recommended more was a ""dangerous quack?""So, read with caution, and a careful eye on your own body and situation. But I personally am glad I bought it."
1,This guy is a hack.,"The book is terrible and contains little more than a conspiracy theory. Do not buy this book. Like he said, ""I'm not a doctor, I'm just reporting."" A lot of these ""cures"" are fairly well known anyways, even Wikipedia contains most of these ""cures""."
4,Many ideas and philosophies in this book,"If you want a complete listing of a variety of well-known and little known therapies and ever wondered what they were all about, this book gives one a very good orientation. My aunt was reading this book and recommended it to me and it certainly furthered my education. Why don't they teach about some of these things in medical school? Even if they are strange, they could all be clinically tested. Why aren't they? Well I thought I knew about quacks and crackpots, but it seems the very people that say those things - are the quacks and crackpots themselves. Now that was a lesson I'll never forget either. From talking to my firends, I know there is a growing conservative movement in this country that is looking for solutions more natural in health and I am so happy to see this view coming more to light from the author, bless him."
1,"Horrible Book and Laughing at the ""Brady Bunch"" Parody Song","The person who wrote the funny song that is to be sung to the theme song of the Brady Bunch is quite clever and has really added a funny take on this whole pitiful story.If you haven't seen it, scroll down a coupel pages and read it. I read it earlier today and can't get it out of my head. It makes me crack up.Tonight I saw yet another infomerical by Trudeau and all I heard was this funny song. I love the line ""a two-time convicted criminal.""It's amazing he is still on the air.At anyrate, this is really a lousy book that doesn't deliver on any of its promises.Really, you have to read that parody song below. It's hysterical."
1,"Natural Cures, I, KevinTrudeau, do not want you to know about.","'Spend more money and I may tell you then' should be the sub-title. Book tells you nothing and spends many, many pages rehashing what was stated in prior chapters, which was really nothing at all. No new information here. Save your money and go to a doctor that specializes in natural cures. The doctor would have more knowledge in his little finger than you will ever get out of this book."
2,nothing new,"I consider myself to be quite knowledgeable on current research and findings in holistic as well as conventional medicine. I have read all the latest research. Most of the claims and advice that Mr. Trudeau offers in his book is not NEW information, it's simply a compilation of information already available in books, periodicals, or on the web. Furthermore, there is no bibliography to back up any of his information and no evidence that he himself has any degree of any sort, let alone holistic or conventional medical training. That said, I also concur with those reviewers who claim his book is merely a tool to drum up business for his expensive website."
2,Good info; Bad book,"Kevin Trudeau talks about a lot of topics that should be brought to the public's attention: corrupt pharmaceutical and food companies, FTC and FDA scandals, how to avoid poor health and how to eat right to live right. But he repeats and repeats and repeats himself over and over and over. In about 100 pages (rather than 571), he could have told this story without all of the repetition. (And Kevin, don't talk about greed and then start the book with you driving a red Corvette and having a secretary at 21 and bragging about all of the money that you've made)."
1,Absolute Garbage,"This is the first review I've written on Amazon about a book and it's a warning to those who may think this book has any value, other than being a paperweight. I was lucky enough to find this pathetic excuse of a book written by this snake oil salesman at a garage sale for .45 cents - ( My apologies to the snakes since they actually serve a real and purposeful function in nature ) - The list of 'cures' are downright nonsense. Oh, and what is the 'cure' for mental/psychological/emotional problems? Scientology! The dead science fiction writers ripoff cult! It's a shame that the FDA and the other agencies couldn't really cure this fraud and drop him in prison where he belongs."
1,waste of money,Long rant with very little valuable information. It is basically an advertisement of author's website that requires subscription.
2,Slick Sales Pitch,This book is alot of bark and not much bite. I want to know who has been cured with the methods this charlatan espouses. This book is a waste of money. Some herbs do help with certain conditions but the placebo effect cannot be discounted.
1,Natural cures? Where?,"Kevin hawks this book like it is full of ""natural cures""--after all, that's the name of the book. Unfortunately, there AREN'T any! He claims the FTC, the FDA, and who knows who will put him in jail. In my opinion he should he in jail for not calling the book, ""Natural Cures Exist, But Not in This Book"""
1,Number one reason Amazon should allow zero stars,"I bought this book while in a hurry in Costco, not from Amazon. Wasted my money. I'm a big reader of nutrition, natural cures, etc., so when I saw this title I grabbed it for some light reading on vacation. The entire book can be condensed to a 3 page pamphlet. Don't take OTC or prescription drugs, doctors are quacks (I happen to believe most are), you need to cleanse regularly, blah, blah, blah. No, and I repeat, no substantiation is provided anywhere between the covers. Having already stolen your money for this pile of cr@p he calls a book, he continually hawks his web site where you can pay even more money to learn the ""secrets"" he alludes to in the book. If you buy it, you only have yourself to blame. This is the last time I buy a book on the spur of the moment without checking reviews. Many, many reviews of this book would have steered me clear of this piece of junk. Please don't give this con man any of your hard earned money."
1,Deceiving,I thought this book was going to really have something in it that the average person could use on a daily basis. But in reality it was about doing 20 different cleanses and then staying away from everything in the world that could possibly harm you. It wasn't realistic at all and I was extremely disappointed. Save your money.
1,I Found This Book To Be Complete Nonsense,"I ordered this book because I believe in being as informed as possible about all options of health care but was greatly disappointed when I quickly realized that this book is complete nonsense. I recommend not wasting your money on it, while continuing to think for yourself and inform yourself as much as possible about the best way to care for yourself and your health."
1,"Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You To Know About","Kevin T is a liar. He feeds on the fears of others. I have never written a review on Amazon before, but I feel so strongly about this book that I feel obligated to speak. I very much believe in a healthy natural lifesyle. Kevin T does not. He is expliting those who suffer from disease. He is simply lining his own pockets. He is a con artist who states that this book is simply his opinion. This is a waste of your money. Do not buy this book. If you must read it, go to the library. This man is dangerous. He is his own worst example of love of money being the root of all evil. He is indeed evil...but then this is only my opinion. (I only gave him one star because there is not the option for less.)"
1,Kevin Trudeau is a Quack,"I am a first year medical student, and even from my limited pool of knowledge, I can tell Kevin Trudeau is full of quackery. In his mis-infomercial, he promised 'cures' for many serious, chronic diseases that unfortunately currently have no cures. He's playing with the vulnerability and hopes of thousands of terminally ill people.I don't know how this guy sleeps at night. In fact, I don't know how he is not being thrown into jail for all the misinformation."
2,Do What I'm Gonna Do,"This girl at work told me about htis book and how good it is. Having read most of the reviews of this book, I'm still interested in what the book is about. But instead of buying it, I'll just borrow it from the library. And to whomever feels iffy about this book: being scammed, do the same as me. Rent from the library, don't waste your money, form your own opinion after reading it, if you like it-buy it, if not, then oh well."
3,Dissatisfying,"Unfortunately this book did not provide the detailed information I was hoping for. It gave some slight info, but then directed me to website, to website, to website. If I wanted to spend my free time on the Internet going to website after website I could search and find the information without a membership fee. I will say that it did dive into some truths about how certain individuals and companies within our medical community who are more tied to the agendas of making money rather then being truly loyal to their oaths. Still, I would rather suggest the book Utopian Reality for people on that wavelength."
2,"Interesting book, but...","...it doesn't really support his point unless you go to his website, and spend more money! A coworker of mine lend me the book, I was interested at first, but as soon as I went to his website, I was disappointed. His website doesn't give any information about a single cure unless you throw in more $$!!"
3,Kevin Truedau Book,I received this book quickly as I do with all items I receive through Amazon.com. This book is OK. I am neutral about recommending this book.
1,THIS PRODUCT IS A SCAM! DO NOT BUY!,Please click on this link and see what a fake he is. While it might be true that the government withholds information on health related products his book does not give you the information you need for your health.[...]
4,True Eye Opener,"This is something everyone should read. Information is power and although many may discredit him as being ""hokey"" and ""tree hunger like"" he never the less knows alot of information that most of us do not have access to. I normally take the 80% approach. Maybe not everything he says about the consperacies are 100% true, but even if some of it is, well that just makes me cringe. Also, given that alot of documenataries are showing up recently talking this exact same thing has to make you wonder, ""is this really a bunch of babble as other opposing sites make it out to be? or is there some truth to this?"" There is a lot of repetition in his book, but I think it's to make people learn what this is all about and really drive the point to your head that just because the FDA/FTC (or any other regualted government official) says it's ok, doesn't mean it is."
2,Not what I expected,"If you want the lodown on for mega profit drug companies then this is the book for you. As far as natural remedys for specific ailments, it is lacking badly."
1,Where's the beef?,"Actually I listened to Kevin reading his book, which he called an audio book. I called it boring, repetitive, and stressful. In fact I could not listen completely to the last chapter. I was literally getting sick from listening to him plead to join his web site so I could get the information I was misled to believe was in the book. He mentioned the FTA threatened to burn his books. That would have been a good thing and I may just end up doing the burning myself. First I need to see if I can get my money back from Costco. If you see smoke in the far distance and a loud sigh of relief then you'll know I didn't get my money back.Don"
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"This is a HUGE waste of time. It's more like a long-winded editorial than anything else. There is no useful information in this book. Nothing. Zero. His specific references to ""Natural Cures"" fail to tell the reader any details and instead directs you to other books or websites to find out. I don't think this guy knows anything other than how to repeat himself."
1,Follow This Advice at Your Own Risk!,"I just read the 5 star review of a man who claims to be a physician. Well let me just say, as a practicing Proctologist for 19 years and an adjust professor at the Indiana School of Medicine, that the regimen of 15 cleanses in 20 days that Kevin Trudeau recommends is not only useless in terms of improving the health of an individual, but possibly dangerous. Not only can it interfere with the body's absorption of vital nutrients and minerals in the digestive process, but can abrade the walls of the large intestine. Follow this half-cocked advice at your own risk."
1,"Didn't buy, just read the reviews!!","Well i'll admit I didn't buy this book and I haven't read it. I was watching the informercial and I was going to buy the book. But I decided to read the reviews first. Whoa!!!! This guy is disgrace. He claimed to be able to cure cancer and is now being fined and can no longer ""appearing in, producing, or disseminating future infomercials that advertise any type of product, service, or program to the public, except for truthful infomercials for informational publications."" (Sept. 7, 2004, http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/09/trudeaucoral.htm)On top of this I am totally disgusted that some people are actually standing up for this guy. But I guess you have to have some retards to make the world go round. Well go to the website that I have on hear to learn the truth about this guy.PS I got the web address from another review."
2,"Natural Cures ""They"" Do Not Want You to Know About","This book makes me want to stay in my bed and never drink or eat anything.According to this booking there is nothing on the face of the earth that will not cause you to contract a disease. Kevin Trudeau has extreme and elaborate schemes to ""make you perfect"". However, you would have to be filthy rich to be able to afford to stay on the program he wants to put you on because noone else could afford it! I guess I am frustrated with the impossible scenarios of this book. Some of the items that he wants you to ply your body with, well educated people have never even heard of!I'd be interested to see some totally factual research of REAL PEOPLE who have followed his program to a T and see how they are doing. Much of the items that Kevin wants you to get you better get ready for shipping and handling charges big time!"
1,Total [...],Please save your money.This man has served in jail and been fined and banned by the ftc from television for his prior actions.He can sell a book because he is protected by the first amendment and can do this.The five star reviews are being made by him and his friends.If you don't believe me check how many reviews people who have voted five stars have.They only voted on this.Hopefully this man will get his in the end for making false claims to get money from those who are really suffering.TOTAL [...]!
1,Kevin is a conman,"Simple research will make it clear to the inquisitive that this man is simply a conartist. Kevin takes advantage of rational people's distrust of the FDA and pharmaceutical companies in order to make a profit by selling lies. People will defend him because they feel if they admit that he is a liar then they will be turning their back on holistic medicine altogether. This is a shame because they do more disservice than good to the field they are trying to defend.If you really do have faith in Kevin's claims, you still don't need this book. Just cure your cancer with his Coral Calcium. Or your debilitating back pain, pain from arthritis, sciatica, and migraines with his Biotape. At least those worthless products don't refer you to his website."
1,If you buy this book you are wasting your time and money.,"I read just the first few chapters of this book and was so disappointed that anyone would waste paper on publishing this nuttiness. Do not buy this book. Spend money on going to the doctor, trying conventional medicine, and exercise."
1,Author Is Convicted Felon,"I respectfully suggest you do a quick bit of research before buying this book. The author's history (and conviction) of criminal fraud is well-documented and is so extensive and unprincipled that any product associated with him is questionable. You won't see him selling his products on tv anymore, because he's been banned for life by the FCC for making false claims and lying to his customers about the legitimacy of his ""cures"". Hence he's found a loophole and has turned to books to sell his products. This is an infomercial in print. There are many excellent books about alternative medicine but this is not one of them. Look into books by authors like Paul Pitchford, Phyllis Balch, or Andrew Weil instead."
5,HE IS NOT THE ENEMY HERE. READ DEEPER INTO THE PROBLEM.,"CAN'T YOU PEOPLE SEE THAT HE IS REALLY JUST TRYING TO TELL US WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS UP TO. HE IS NOT THE ENEMY HERE, IT IS THE FDA AND THE DRUG COMPANIES. I WONDER WHY SOME OF YOU GET SO NASTY AND AGITATED OVER A BOOK THAT IS REALLY ONLY TRYING TO UNFORM YOU OF THE BROADER HORIZON. TAKE IT EASY. GEEZ!!"
4,Interesting Information,This book explains things that most people never think about. It will cause you to think about what you eat and drink and explains that there is danger in many things you thought were safe to use.It is most interesting concerning natural cures verses prescription drugs.
1,Are you insane?,"PEOPLE REMEBER, THERE ARE NO CURES FOR ANYTHING! IF THERE WAS, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE SUFFERING AND DYING OF VARIOUS DISEASES.I OUGHT TO KNOW, I HAVE MS (MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS) AND TRUST ME, IF THERE WAS A ""CURE"" FOR IT AS MR. TRUDEAU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE YOU THINK THERE WAS, THEN ALL OF US (OVER A FEW MILLION) WOULD BE CURED AND NOT SUFFERING AND DYING!GET A GRIP PEOPLE, THIS IS JUST FALSE HOPE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING A HARD TIME EXCEPTING THIER PROBLEMS.FOLLOW YOUR DOCTORS ADVISE, EAT RIGHT, GET PLENTY OF EXERSIZE AND LIVE LIFE TO IT'S FULLEST UNTILL A ""REAL"" CURE IS FOUND BY CREADIBLE SOURCES."
1,Extreme Con Man,"My first impression of people are almost always right. The first time I saw this clown on tv some years ago, I said to myself. 'what a deceitful looking person'. I WAS RIGHT. America will fall badly if it does not deal with evil with an iron fist.GET RID OF THESE CON MEN."
1,Secret cures,"Vulnerable, suffering, desperate are patsies for easy cures/relief.My husband is an MD. He wouldn't or couldn't deny miracle cures/treatments if they worked--and his patients have tried them all. They couldn't be kept them a secret.Would doctors and the FDA deny these 'miracle'cures --these teased but undelivered treatments-- to their families, patients, and friends?No. They don't exist--the author is a quack. This book was a ripoff and the author should be ashamed."
1,It is ALL about $$,"He tells you several times the FDA, doctors, everybody in the ""diet"" industry is only in the game to make $$. He doesn't tell you he is only writing this book, making several references to go to his website to get more information, for $$ himself. Many of the ""bullet points"" on how to never get sick again, or how to lose weight forever and listed on his website but you have to PAY to get the information. He certainly could have written the information in the book... after all, we did spend $$ on the book. Lifetime membership to his website is $[..] What a [..]"
1,Garbage,"If Kevin Trudeau wrote this book as a research paper for any respectable university course, the paper would receive an automatic F. And that's if he was lucky enough to not get expelled. How on earth do you write book with out doing proper research, checking your facts, and citing your sources? The author gives medical advice to people with serious life threatening conditions, and doesn't provide any citations to the claims he makes. On top of that he has absolutely no medical training.Kevin Trudeau towards alternative medicine is just like Kent Hovind towards Young Earth Creationism. Don't bother with his nonsense."
1,Slick Con Artist - Indited by Federal Trade Commission,"He has been indited by the Federal Trade Commission, just do a google search! He takes a few vague bits of information that sounds like the truth and twists it into a profit making machine."
1,Poor,"This book is filled with conjecture and is not concise. While I would agree with the title, the documentation is not there. I found no information that would cause me to take another course of action after reading the book. Also, it is advertised on the radio for free, but when you call they refuse to ship it unless you let them sign you up for memberships you don't want. Buyer Beware!"
5,Good information,"I learned so much from this book. I feel so much more aware of what is really going on with our health in the US. If you care about your health and that of your family, then this should be one of the books on your shelf.There's so much information in this book on living healthier, but I have 2 favorites. The first one is if you can't pronounce it, don't eat it. The second one is if you can't eat it, don't put it on your skin. I like how the author makes it that simple."
1,Don't Bother,This man makes $ because he enjoys drawing people in for absolutely NOTHING! I won't waste any more time on a review. Lock this felon up for life!
5,Be vigilant about your health,"If you're interested in health and personal care, you've gotta check out this book. There is so much in it that will totally blow you away. This guy really goes the distance in spilling the truth about our healthcare system and the connection to drug manufacturers. The book is a comprehensive look at so many areas we need to be vigilant about in order to maintain good health in today's unhealthy environment. The book helped me see how personally vigilant I need to be in order to keep my family and friends healthy."
1,dangerous quack,"personally I think the author should be arrested for advising everyone to stop taking ALL prescription drugs.I can't recall whether he said to check with your health care provider (he reccommends a Naturopath or Homeopath who would be biased against drugs).The problem as I see it is that the beleivers might just stop taking their meds without bothering to check and see if this is ok.Drugs are expensive and he is telling people they don't need them.Just take ""cleanses""enemas instead."
1,Please don't waste your money,"There are legitimate alternative medical treatments that will do some good, or at least not harm you, as these so-called ""Natural Cures"" may. This author gives no regard to the diabetics, cancer victims and others that have been harmed by this book by abandoning life saving treatment. Mr. Trudeau is neither selective of nor does he give valid support for the treatments included in this book. Unfortunately this charlatan is profiting from trusting people who do not know of his long history of fraud and deception."
2,Use Common Sense,"I think the book offers some good points....lots of water, walking and organic food. The rest, if you take to heart, will create something that I felt while reading this book....stress. Use common sense when reading this and you judge what is right for you. If you take everything to heart that this guy says...you will live in a completely paranoid state. Afraid to take a bath because of the chlorine..afraid to drink your own water because of fluoride...afraid to breastfeed because you have jet fuel in your milk...afraid of everything that you eat unless you grow it in your own backyard (but watch it because toxins are lurking in your soil)...I mean come on....I hope the next book he writes is advice on how to get over being paranoid of everything."
5,STOP THE DANGER IN DRUGS,"140,000 heart attacks, strokes and deaths caused by Vioxx - page 423. Who knows what the count is now. And we are upset and worried about the government's response to a natural disaster. Where is our concern about how incompetent the FDA is? Are we demanding a review and overhaul? This book isn't fooling around. These ""stories aren't pretend. Medical drug practices are killing us off worse and any natural disaster on this planet."
4,Skeptic,"I believe Nature has cures for everything but the problem is in locating that thing which is the cure or is used to create the cure. Without documented case histories or evidence that is verified by the institutions who declare and describe was a disease itself is, I don't think you have a cure. I understand the idea that the government is trying to protect drug companies but that isn't a cure for anything. I think the book I read has too many smoke and mirrors and the author has masked cures behind them. Maybe I missed the documented evidence of cures? I am still skeptical."
2,not happy,"This book was suspose to be like new. It was written in , had writing at the front and back of the book, has been damp and warped, will not stand up at all. Not a happy camper with this one. The description was not true at all, it said like new.."
5,unfortunately so true,He verified how corrupt the fda is. I heard red yeast rice is good for lowering cholesterol and went on web to search. Sure enough fda found it true so made it illegal to sell naturally. They are using it synthetically now in some cholesterol lowering meds
5,Excellent book filled with reality!,"My father is an MD for a large HMO. We both read this book and agree with around 90% of what is written. This is especially true when the author states ""the medical and food industry does not care about its customers...its all about the money"". Sad but very true...if you think your doctor really cares about you and or your health think again. Wake up! All you are to doctors is just another medical record #! Doctors speak out patients names and put on a phony smile as a courtesy NOT because they care about you."
5,Wasn't looking for what I found,Purchased this book to help my husband with some stomach problems he was having. I found as I was reading the book some things really seemed like they were directed at me. Okay I was eating too much fast food and not drinking any water on most days. I had it justified that tea had water in it and juice was liquid too. I asked my Chiropractor about the water thing and see showed me some referenced on it.I broke down and started drinking the water and haven't we heard that from everywhere. I confess I did feel better. And I did get some answers for my husbands stomach problems.
2,"Why doesn't he wear WHITE like he advises ""FOR ENERGY""??","I haven't read the book, but I saw the author on that awful FOX news channel... but the FOX host did ask him a good question: ""Kevin, you advise readers in your book to wear white because it gives good energy... but why aren't you wearing white NOW?"" He gave some stupid response about t.v. lighting... I didn't want to give it 1 star, so I randomly gave it TWO stars, without reading it. I don't like the idea of him selling stuff over the internet for ""more information""... seems like a waste to me. There are other book authors that give similar information, that appear to TRULY want to help people for a REASONABLE profit of selling a book... not cosmetics and overpriced vitimins over the internet. Be careful."
5,Did you know this about the water????????Read the book,"Surprising to me after reading the book and sharing some of the info with a co-worker how uninformed we are in this country and how much we need this book. The topic was water and she was adding oxygen to the bottled water, just like he talks about in the book. She is from France and was telling me how the water here did not really handle her thirst. It is so over processed - this is not done in France -- there is nothing good left in it."
1,author is full of crap,book is a waste of money. author is full of crap. very misleading. very dissapointed with book. will burn in next fire.
2,"Why are all his ""cures"" so fantastically expensive?","While I agree with him on many fronts (eating organic food is the way to go, and avoiding all mass produced items), most of his other ""cures"" are fantastically expensive (having your colon flushed every other day?) plus, I doubt that is good for you!I have achieved excellent health by switching to a mostly raw diet of fruit and veggies, with a little bit of rice and beans, and low fat.He has a big business going with all the products he recommends.I think the less products, the better.I am so sick of being hustled!"
3,It's O. K.,"I bought this book for my Mom after she had heard about it on T.V. She was a little disappointed, it wasn't what she expected. It does have a few ""natural cures"" but most she had heard about already and the ones that she hadn't were impractical for the average person. It has some good information, but definately not a ""cure all"" book as advertised."
1,natural cures,This book is worthless and a total scam. Not informative in the least and a waste of money.
1,Garbage,"Trudeau's books would work for someone who lives in a world where days are 56 hours long, doesn't need to spend time working, has unlimited time and funds to dedicate to growing their own products or shopping endlessly for ingredients not found in many areas. Now that a few million have purchased these books, (me included), he's a wealthy man, and will publish more useless books on,yet, another subject that will entice more of us poor fools...no more for me."
1,Waste of money,"This book is total waste of money. I Would not recommend this book to anyone unless you want to throw your money away. To purchase a book then have to go to his website and pay for further information does not seem right. He thinks the government etc are ripping us off, well to me that is exactly what Kevin Trudeau is doing."
1,Natural Cures book is mistitled,"Should be titled ""They don't want you to know about natural cures and neither do I unless you subscribe to my website"".It's not that the book doesn't contain a lot of information, but if you're looking forward to receiving a book full of formulas for natural cures, keep looking (or buy it used).Kevin Trudeau knows how to sell and that ""there's a sucker born every minute"". Unfortunately, I fell for the infomercial's pitch."
1,conspiracy theory yes- cures no,"If you are into Government conspiracies you'll love this book. Over 80% is a tirade agains the FTC, FDA and other initialed organizations.If, however, you are trying to improve your health or deal with problems you are having DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Put your money into a copy of ""Prescription for Nutritional Healing"" By James Balch. You'll get more info on one page than the whole of ""Cures""""Cures"" does give you a number of internet links for more info. Some of which aren't for the ""Cures"" author's own web site and it's membership charges. It includes several pages of references to other books and such earth shattering advice as ""Reduce Stress"" ""Smile""""Listen to Music"" ""Breath"" and my favorite ""Eat Chocolate""You'll learn more from a good relationship with your local heathfood store and nearly everything this book has to offer from it's infomercial."
1,WORST BOOK EVER !!!!!!!,"This was the biggest scam! He doesn't actually tell you any cures. But at least once on every he page he refernces his web site that you have to go to for cures. But I am sure you have to pay for that too. Plus he constantly listed books and says how he does not get any money for any of these books. Then at the end of the book he lists all of the same books and admits that he does get a profit from the sales! He is a thief and a lier! I bought the book from his tv commercial because he claimed that it would give me the cures for everything. First thing I did was turn to the chapter called""How to cure everything"" and it says that the whole chapter has been censored by the FTC so he can't share any info. It seems that his book is a way to sell his website and newsletter which constantly mentions the same hints at cures as his book does. All he does is rant about how it is a conspiracy. Maybe so, but it is not all about him. This man is seriously delusional!!!"
1,This book belongs in the trash...,"I have no financial interest in drug companies. I have no medical or other special interest and I can state with a clean conscience that this book, in my opinion, is a load of horse manure. Thankfully, I did not waste my money on this book and I suggest that you don't either. I am a fan of alternate therapies and I believe that there is a lot of natural cures that can benefit people. However, you won't find them in this book. He directs you to a website that you have to subscribe to in order to get the information you thought you were going to get by reading his book. This man is a convicted felon that preys on the insecurity and fears of fellow humans. Shame on him."
1,Buyer Beware,"This Book Sells Snake Oil... Kevin Trudeau sells this book on an infomercial, and then the book sells the website. There is no real information in this book; it refers you to his website which you have to pay to join. Kevin Trudeau is not even a college graduate. His claims are largely bogus. For example; go and get fifteen colonics in a months time. Colonics cost about $70 each, so that is $1050 for the month. I don't know about you, but that seems like a stupid and dangerous endeavor. Take my advice... don't buy his books. He is a billionaire because he is so good at selling these scams. It's embarassing that I fell for another one... Never again."
1,A Waste of Paper and your Money if you Buy it,"This book should be called ""Natural Cures ""I"" Don't Want You To Know About Unless You Pay Me More On My Website"". This book is a 273 page advertisement for his website on which you will have to pay additionally for the information you thought you were getting in the book. Don't waste your money on the book and I wouldn't recommend the website of someone who'd sell such a book."
4,"Natural Cures ""They"" Don't want you to know about","Easy to read, a guide step by step in preventing many health problems. I recommend the book to my family and friends, as matter of fact, I am purchasing several copies as gifts."
1,STOP BUYING THIS CRIMINAL'S PRODUCTS,"Kevin Trudeau is the disease we'll never find the cure for. His products are useless and misleading. This book has NO CURES AND NO EVIDENCE OF ANY CURES BEING AVAILABLE. There are reviews here that support Trudeau's book for reprinting old information - an orange cures scurvy, etc; however, these people are in bed with Kevin, or just plain stupid/blind.KEVIN IS EVIL - HE OUTRIGHT LIES ON HIS INFOMERCIAL. HE TELLS YOU TO SHUN MODERN MEDICINE, YET FAILS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN ALTERNATIVE. YOU'VE READ IT HERE AND EVERYWHERE ON THE INTERNET - KEVIN IS A FAKE AND NOBODY SHOULD PURCHASE ANY OF HIS ITEMS, EVER."
1,Thanks,I would like to thank each Amazon customer who gave a review of Kevin Trudeau's book it kept me from buying. Thanks for your honesty. Mary
1,A Re-Directory for information,"What little information this book tells you about those ""natural cures"" are already common knowledge. It goes on and on, ad nauseum, about corruption, and very little about the cures themselves. If you want more information about certain alleged cures, the book tells you to go to certain websites, and when you get there, you have to pay. He should be paying us to read this infomercial in book form, which is basically a variation of the old ""bait and switch."" You are baited, and then misled to get into his and his associates' pay-up-front websites."
2,Disappointed with infomercials,"This book reads just like an infomercial sounds. Some of the information sounds credible and I have encountered it elsewhere, but some does not and NONE of it is substantiated in any way. By this I mean, he does not offer collateral resources for one to verify the data he put forth. Also some of his ideas & recommendations seems a little over the top to me. The book is VERY long but the essence of the contents could have been written in 100 to 125 pages. I was disappointed overall."
1,"Much better books out there, don't line this guy's pockets!","If you're really interested in alternative cures, there are many much better books out there.The grand-daddy of them all is Prescription for Nutritional Healing by James and Phyllis Balch and available right here on Amazon.Kevin Trudeau is simply an opportunist and I surely wouldn't entrust my health to him. His track record is entirely too reprehensible. And the book is simply a way to get you to pay fees to join his website.Please do your health, and your pocketbook, a favor and give this guy a wide berth!"
1,False advertisement if i ever seen it,"I heard a lot of hype about this book so i bought it.I have never seen such false advertisement. He talks about a lot of realvent things but he talks about how ""its all about the money""...boy he is not kidding you have to pay to see his website 499.00 for a lifetime membership or 9,95 a month.......um i thought thats why i was buying the book! to see the ""cures"".For someone who talks about the government and other companies ripping people off he sure is doing the same but thats just my opinion.It is a little entertaining but thats all."
1,"Sorry to break it to you, folks","For all you conspiracy theorists out there, be aware that Kevin Trudeau spent two years in federal prison in the early 90's after pleading guilty to credit card fraud. Look it up on Salon.com"
1,Don't Waste Your Time/Money!,"This book is not worth the paper it is written on nor the time it takes to read it. Very disappointing! The subject needs to be addressed, but the author doesn't do it...just goes on and on raving and saying nothing. IT IS JUST A BIG AD FOR HIS OTHER PRODUCTS. I would recommend NOT reading this book"
1,I wish I had read the reviews first,"Well, I wasted 30 bucks. Everything everyone wrote below is 100% acurate. While Trudeau may well be presenting accurate information, his ""high pressure "" style of getting his point across and the absence of references really lessens his credibility. That and, oh yes, the book appears to be written on approximately a 6 grade level. And as far as the website goes and this book being a big advertisement for it, well, I guess he knows exactly what he is talking about with the drug companies because he appears to be using the same tactics. This is the first time that I bought a book through Amazon that I was sorry I spent the money for. Nothing against Amazon; they're great. [...]"
1,Worthless Hype,"This book is just an extended plug for the author's web site, which will cost you $[...]/yr to join. Supposedly, that's where all the good information is hidden since ""they"" have threatened him if he reveals any of it publicly. There are no natural ""cures"" in the book and very little useful information except what is common knowlege.Eat lots of fruits and vegetables; Keep a positive mental attitude; Get plenty of rest.There, now you don't have to read the book. Thank goodness I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it. If you are at all interested I suggest you do the same."
1,SCAM SCAM SCAM,"Kevin Trudeau is a marketer extraordinaire, with a more-than-checkered past. A twice-convicted felon, he served time in a Federal penitentiary, for credit card fraud. The Federal Trade Commission has prosecuted him more than once for making and airing fraudulent infomercials. He has been the subject of investigations by 18 state Attorneys General and the US Postal Service. His involvement in Nutrition for Life, Inc. (NFLI), a multilevel marketing business based in Houston, TX, ended ignominiously after the SEC began investigating his distributor recruitment practices On April 17, 1996, the Illinois Attorney General filed suit against Trudeau and a partner for running an illegal pyramid scheme with Nutrition for Life and Nightingale-Conant, another MLM dealing in motivational books and tapes. The State of Michigan ordered Trudeau to cease all marketing in the state related to his business, the Trudeau Marketing Group."
1,"Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You To Know About","This is a very disappointing book. The author is vague and repeats himself constantly with his ""rantings"" and fails to give clear lessons on how to achieve optimal health.I am an advocate for Natural Health, however, this book simply comes across as a diatribe of hatred for the FDA.Do not waste your money on this book."
1,Wiki this man before you buy this book,"I quote from wikipedia :""Trudeau's activities have been the subject of both criminal and civil action. He was convicted of larceny and credit card fraud in the early 1990s, and in 1998 paid a $500,000 fine for making false or misleading claims in his infomercials. In 2004, he consented to a lifetime ban on promoting products other than his books via infomercials.""That means the only way he can make money through his lies is by doing something that is protected by our 1st ammendment rights. Don't make yourself a fool."
1,Kevin's Book Is Only Good To Burn In Your Fireplace,"Kevin Tredeau is one of the biggest rips offs and con artists in the book/publishing industry. He talks a good talk on television and then when you buy his high priced books they are almost useless with very little information. He is a huge rip off, don't waste your money on his books, they have almost no useful information in them."
1,This book has no valuable information,The author claims that there are natural cures for every disease or disorder. This is definitely not the case. There is no real description of any supposed cure. This is an author with no formal training in medicine or health. The book reads like a marketing ploy.
1,What a rip-off!,"This is merely a promotional tool for Trudeau's website, the use of which requires a monthly subscription fee. Every ""cure"" is blocked by government agencies from being printed, but links are provided on the website. What a scam! The one star rating is only because there was no selection for zero."
1,Kevin Trudeau is Self Serving,"Kevin Trudeau has conspiracy embedded in his mind. He is possessed with drug companies making bogus drugs and offering non existant cures.He does all this without offering one iota of evidence. He tells that there are 15,000 chemicals that will harm you if you eat normal food but offers not one shred of evidence or names one chemical.His book is a non scientific opinon that allows him to offer a self promoting web site which tells the reader to buy his magic food supplements and they will live forever.A total waste of money and a big disappointment."
1,BOOK IS A CROCK OF CRAP!!!!,LESSON LEARNED? READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE WASTING YOUR MONEY!!!!This book is only a $30.00 advertisement for the author's website! NOTHING is explained in the book. All it does is refer you to the website where you have to pay to be a member. AND you must be a member to get the answers you thought you would get in the book.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME!!!!! Kevin Trudeau is deceiving us all with his untruthful and misleading advertisements!!!!!
2,"Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You To Know About","I got turned off fairly quickly by the book, because I was reading information that I have seen or read quite a few times before."
1,infuriating rip off,"[...] The book promises natural cures in its title, but won't give them because it claims the government will sue the author for dispensing medical advice. The government has indeed sued-- because the author misrepresents what's in his ads, not because he exercised free speech. The book directs the reader to a website that won't give you entrance. If you want a book that gives cures, read ""Yeast Connection and the Woman"" or ""Food Your Miracle Cure,"" both written by medical doctors/nutritionists, not ex-cons."
1,"Who is this guy, and why is he so paranoid?","Give me a break. ""They"" don't want you to have good health. ""They"" are keeping remedies away from you. ""They"" are trying to fleece you. (See other reader's comments about Trudeau!)This book has been written as an irrational appeal to the emotions. Given rational consideration, one can see that, in the American free market, people and businesses generally want to keep other people -- their customers and employees healthy and happy. Why would Ford, say, want to keep vital safety information from their customers? Isn't a living customer a good customer, and a dead customer an oxymoron?Please, Mr Trudeau, stop ripping people off. Then, if you want to write books full of conspiracy theory, at least put that on the cover."
1,Snake oil salesman always find buyers,"Anyone who thinks Kevin Trudeau actually knows enough about anything, other than the art of selling, to write this book has been had by a slick marketing genius. The guy is a convicted felon - credit card fraud - and this is not the first big plate of nothing he's tried to sell us. Remember his book about ""amazing memory""? We can debate ad nauseum the benefits of ""natural"" medicine. Remember, opium and cocaine are ""natural"" and most people wouldn't recommend you take them. If you paid to purchase his book, you got had. I think the guy is dangerous, frankly, and ought to be prevented from ever selling anything again."
1,Ought to file a class action law suit,"[...] Sure he ""says"" he has all the natural cures you need to live long and healthy but in reality after you pay $30 for his book you get to spend another $9.95 every month on his web site to acutally find the ""cures"". I assume they are there I wasn't stupid enough to throw another $9.95 away after I just spent $30.00 on a book of double talk and bull. Stay away from this book and any others he has written. [...]"
1,Title very misleading,"After paying 30 dollars I though I would have learned something new. You will learn more from the advertisement on TV. The book stated information we already know. Eat right, and eat natural products. I thought he would have given us a list of illness and cures (NOT). After loosing $30 why would I want to lose more money to gain access to a web sight I know nothing about. They should have given you a 30 day trial. I Wonder why they didn't do that? I would really rate this book at a 0"
1,Do not buy this.,Natural cures he doesnt want you to know about it too. Do not waste your money on scum like this one.
2,it's all about the money,"Trudeau says it's all about the money...true meaning him making it. if you go to his web site for more info as suggested in the book, first then you have to become a member of his club at a very substantial price not to mention his other nefarious ways of getting your money"
5,Natural Cures,Some of the other reviews surprise me because this book is quite interesting and NOT total nonsense as some have stated.
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,"I purchased this book hoping to gain some insight into new and different approaches to care for myself and my family that are more geared toward natural healing and homeopathy, rather than modern Western medicine practices. What I found, instead, were pages and pages of what felt like paranoid schizophrenia with undertones of Big Brother conspiracies. I should have known better than to take an author seriously who advertises on a late-night infomercial. Definitely not worth the money I spent on it."
5,Natural Cures,"This book is a must-read for every decent human being on this planet. this is a courageous expose of the conspiracy of the pharmaceutical industry, the medical industry the FDA and the commercial food industry to control and make enormous profits at the expenxse of the health and well-being of the consumers on this planet, and to suppress any industry or private enterprise with the purpose of true health and wellness through natural means.Mr. Trudeau has been falsely maligned by the very powerful officials of these organizations, a common tactic to keep the consumers enslaved to the false and misleading propaganda that will keep the consumer addicted, sick and ever spending on food and medical care to make them sicker and sicker to make the conspirators rich.I have been aware of the information in his book for many years and for those who want to truly take their lives in their own hands and take a stand to preserve the little bit of freedom we we still have, this book is a must-read."
1,Tired of Rip Offs,"I don't know how many of you got ripped off like me, but I did not recieve the CD like it says on TV. Yes """"I'll throw in this CD at no extra cost..........HA!! I have called, talked with customer service, wrote Kevin T. a personal email, have done all I know to do to get them to send me the CD. It's been aprox. 3 mos. now. I give up. Ok Kevin you got me, but not again. I would strongly suggest nobody else believe anything he says 100% He has proven to me that his word is no good. Here's my sign!!!"
2,"intersting but, not very useful","It was interesting but, not what I expected. I thought it would be full of cures that people used over the ages. It's not. It's also boring to read."
5,A little overwhelming,"As I read this book, I found it to be a little overwhelming. It addresses so many issues on health and our environment and the government and the medical industry and the FDA. I felt like there were so many things I needed to confront and change that I didn't want to do anything. It's a lot to swallow all at once. I didn't even know where to start.Then I remembered the author talking about just doing one thing at a time and then slowly adding another and another. Also, that even changing a few small things can have a big impact in your life. That's what I am doing.Even though I still feel a bit bombarded with everything I need to change in my lifestyle for myself and my family, I am very glad I read this book. I know that being educated is the first step in improvement. I threw away my microwave yesterday and I'm putting a juicer where it used to sit!!!"
5,MIRACLE BOOK!!!!!!!!,"THIS BOOK IS A REVELATION. I WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD IN 2008,BUT AFTER READING THIS BOOK AND FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS,I CAME BACK TO LIFE IN 2009.IF YOU DONT BELIEVE ME,JUST ASK ME. BUY IT TODAY!!!!!"
5,A Brave Book,"Pros:* Thorough research* Truly ground-breaking revelations about the health and food industries* Every day ailments looked at honestly* A no fluff analysis of what we eat and how we harm our bodies.* A lesson to us all, to truly think about what is really being sold to us on a daily basis* A real eye-openerCons:* None! A must read for every adult on the planet!"
1,very impressive nevertheless,"This book changed my life; Mr. Trudeau really knows his stuff. Following his natural cures i resolved a number of serious problems including cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and worst of all, hard stools. In terms of literary value, Trudeau seems to have been influenced most by Bill O'Reilly and General Schwarzkoff. There are traces of DH Lawrence and Henry James in his prose style, but they are rather faint. I regard this book, from purely a literary standpoint, as one of the greatest to emerge in the last twenty years. It makes for riveting reading, and the characters haunt you long after you finish it. This is the kind of book that makes you really think and feel deeply. It's the kind of book you'll want to reread at least several times, cover to cover, as I have. This book is a flat-out classic, the closest to the ""great American non-novel"" I've ever read."
1,Thank you for customer reviews,"I really appreciate the customer reviews on Amazon.com.After seeing the infomercial I was tempted to buy this book. With all the references to a paid website it would have gone back for sure. It also led me to look up Kevin Trudeau. See for yourself on quackwatch.comT. WicksLawton, OK"
2,Credibility questionable,"My husband saw Kevin on TV(turned out to be an infomercial) and was raving about what he had to say, so when I saw the book, I bought it. Some of what he says makes good sense and is actually supported elsewhere (which is why I gave 2 stars). He uses his web site as a place for further information extensively throughout...in fact, you're supposed to go there if you want to know more about just about everything he has to say. He would have a lot more crediblility if the web site was free.....not!!!! I would recommend that you do a websearch on this man before buying. I highly suspect this is just another way to fleece the consumer by going through the back door. You have to admire the guy, if, for his ingenuity alone."
1,This book is awful!,"This book was a sucker buy. I am getting my money back! Don't waste your money or time on him. I am completely into natural cures.... but he doesn't give you any. And not only that, but his section on ""effortlessly"" losing weight... looks like the most difficult way I have ever seen! 15 colonics in 15 days? 21 day juice fasts? and 20 some odd more ideas.. only a few of them are feasible. Save your money. Buy something else."
1,Trudeau is worse than the drug companies!,"NEGATIVE 10 stars!!!I bought this book after my son had seen it on an infomercial. He was trying to get off of his ADD meds, and was hopeful that there would be ideas in this book. I agreed & sprung for the book AND the audio book.Suffice it to say it was a horrible let down. Chapter after chapter of how the drug companies ""suck people in"" and take their money. My question...How is Trudeau any better than the companies he accuses? He does the same thing!His book was a big commercial for people to sign up for more ""information"" on his website. (Yes, you have to pay for that too!)Trudeau & his publisher should be ashamed for selling this book. It's simply cruel to hurt people this way!"
3,Book Wrongly Titled; Maybe overpriced by $10.00,"The ""Health Information"" was helpful and interesting, although only a very small portion of the book dealt with health. The book's topic matter was 90% of anti-government commentary which I feel should have been in a separate book entitled ""What the Government Won't Tell You"". I purchased the book after watching the infomercial during which the author stated several times ""I am forbidden to mention this on t.v., but it is in the book"". Well once you buy the book you read that ""the information cannot be printed in the book"" and that you need to refer to a website for which coincidentally there is a charge. I feel that the little section on health info. is very useful, but viewers are misled by the television infomercial into believing that they are to purchase the book to get answers only to find this info. is NOT in the book."
1,He should be ashamed,"Perused this in the bookstore on a lark. There are two primary problems with this book:a) The book is primarily an advertisement for his website, where you can get the ""real"" information, for only $400.00b) There is a genuine risk that people will die or otherwise suffer harm by being misled into avoiding genuine treatments for afflictions."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK !!!!!!!!!,"This is NOTHING like what it was advertised to be. It gives you absolutely NO information --- it's nothing but a LENGTHY pile of words to get you to go to his website and pay him MORE MONEY to find out the information you should have been able to acquire from spending $30.00 for the book. This is the worse case of ""false"" advertising I've ever seen. I was extremely excited to get the book... then I read it. I threw it in the trash. I won't even try to GIVE it to someone... or sell it as a used book on amazon because I wouldn't stoop that low and would be embarrassed to give it to a friend. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This book is a $ making scam.,"This book tells a person to refer to his website for the full information the entire time. naturalcures.com Then, the website tells you to pay to become a member so that you can see the cures. Wasn't $40 enough to get the information. This book is a complete waste of money. I could see paying $5 with shipping for this book but not a dime more. He does not give you any solid info or cure. In fact, the chapter on cures refers to the FDA banning him from giving any cures so he can not say what they are."
2,"""Natural Cures"" not what the Doctor ordered!",The book was less than adequate unless one is looking for Kevin's political views and dissertation on government and medicine. Rather disappointing.
3,Learned a lot from this book,"Just reading the first few chapters of this book, I've really learned a lot. How never to get sick again, why people are fat, what's wrong with health care in America, why are we sick.I already share many of Trudeau's thoughts but I heard about the book and wanted to check it out for myself.How can you lose with information like this. Sure there's things I'd improve with the book, but even still, I learned a lot from it and look forward to finishing it.This is a must read for those interested in doing something about your own good health."
3,"Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You To Know About","The book is an interesting read, but who can truly live their life the way Mr. Trudeau recomends. I would be surprised if even he has the self disipline to restrict his diet and lifestyle the way he recomends."
2,"Some info, lots of","My mother-in-law lent me this book, and I've found it quite addictive, although I haven't finished it yet. She thought it was great, has already made diet changes and such, and is feeling better already. She mentioned Kevin's constant repetition in the book, and I agree... it gets absolutely flagrantly positively 100% annoying!!! Personally I avoid taking medications, pay attention to food labels, etc, but although this guy claims not to be a fanatic, some of his accusations are a little over the top. There is some good information, but I got tired of being directed to his website and/or newletter which he of course charges for. I would check this book out at the library, borrow it, but probably not buy it."
1,Scam Alert,"There are no cures listed in the book so the titles is one huge lie. Also, there is no conspiracy. If there were cures, for example, cancer, doctors and other medical professionals would want it known if for no other reason than to prevent themselves or a loved one from being sick or dying. Kevin Trudeau is simply a rip off artist. I'm sure he has made tons of money off this scam."
5,This is a good change for the future,"As a 70 year old woman I have seen many things come and go. But the nerve of my doctors... trying to tell me life and my health can be solved with a pill just gets my goat. Thank you Kevin Trudeau, for writing this book and for getting back to the basics of health care, as I remember it from my childhood.God help us all if the current government corruption continues. I fear for my grandchildren's future. I hope many people read this book."
3,Good info,"The book had alot of good information..just not alot is very easy to do without alot of money. The way he suggests eating is good, but expensive. I am sure he makes a great point, but ...not everyone is made of money"
1,Snake Oil Salesman,Be aware! Avoid the hype! This guy is out to make a buck and has no sincere interest in your health - unless he can make money off of it. Still not convinced? Check out the NY TImes or any other reputable publication and see what they have to say about him. He's had questionable legal woes and I would not consider him a medical expert - holistic or otherwise.
2,Don't order from the infomercial!!!,"I think the info in this book is ok, but these are really difficult steps to take. I think the book is worth the amazon price, if you want a very comprehensive listing of alternative healing ideas. Don't expect miracles. Don't buy it from the tv ad, they never answer the customer satisfaction phone number once you have the product."
2,Repetitive,Not much to say. I couldn't get past the first chapter. I did skim through but keep getting annoyed with all the repetitiveness.
1,This is just not realistic,"In his book he runs down a list of what not to do.Dont take vitamins, dont use sunscreen, dont use deoderant, dont eat ANYTHING that isnt organic, dont drink anything but spring water, dont use flouride in toothpaste...I mean I dont know if this guy is living in a bubble or what but his suggestions are just unrealisitc in todays world. Not to mention I saw no PROOF of his claims, they are simply a matter of opinion that he claims is research.He supplies none of these supposed ""CURES"" he has--he merely keeps referring you to his website to become a PAYING member if you want the ""cures"".This is nothing but nonsense and unsubstantiated claims. Over 500 pages of nothing but FDA bashing.We all know the FDA is corrupt. He didnt need to write 500 useless pages about it.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Something's not right,"I read this book, as I am a firm believer in not resorting to the drug too often prescribed by the medical profession. However, I resent the fact that Mr. Trudeau cannot substantiate his claims nor can he even give a lot of information without subscribing to his website. Dr. Andrew Weil lists all number of resources, as do other wellness books. The FDA, FTC, etc. are all against him in a dark, thick plot that is never revealed. He says it is all about money. He needs to look in his own backyard."
5,Good Book to have,"I liked this book! I think it has come at a good time when we are being overrun by the Drug Solution. I am so sick and tired of every time you turn around there is a new illness or disease that needs a new pill or drug to fix it. The book helps us refocus and apply some not so common, common sense. I mean can doing things more naturally really hurt us any more that the drugs that are out there - I don't think so. Read this book and see what I am saying."
1,Not what I expected,"I honestly do not understand how this book made to be called bestseller. As the title says ""Natural cures they don't want you to know about"" I expected to read about these cures. What a disappoitment. There is only general idea. For more information I was sent to website that requires membership and fees."
2,not the best of the group,"Trudeau writes about big pharma and all its woes, but if you really want to feel better and get well, this may not be the book you want. I much prefer Dr. James Howenstine's ""A physician's Guide to Natural Health Product That Work"". I've given away numerous copies to friends and family; it's that good.If you want a political treatise, complete with good guys, bad guys, and undercover plots, (and who knows, it may all be true), buy the book. I want to feel better, and that's why I put the Howenstine book way on top."
3,"On the right track, but here's a better book!","Kevin Trudeau has picked up on a national trend to explore alternative, less invasive methods of healing. Daniel Haley's ""The Politics of Healing"" is an outstanding book that describes the cures, how they work, the history of their discoveries, and the unfortunate attacks by the Medical Establishment on their discoverers (for reasons Trudeau speaks of today). The FDA and Big Pharma have been in bed together for decades, to the point where the FDA lets pharmaceutical staff literally write policy for them. We are the losers. I strongly recommend ""The Politics of Healing"" for anyone who needs a serious look at alternatives. I also admire Mr. Trudeau for his forceful and courageous appearance on Good Morning America today (September 27, 2005) to speak out against the FDA and for an open-minded approach to healing ourselves. Bravo, Mr. Trudeau!"
2,"I agree, Trudeau is a FRAUD!",I recommend The Greatest Vitamin in the World by Don Lapree. Much better. Certaainly much better than listening to your Doctor who is making you sicker by pumping garbage into your system and getting bonuses by peddling that garbage. Some doctors are no better than snake-oil salesmen.
1,its a fraud,HI. I BOUGHT THIS BOOK BUT IT IS A FRAUD. IT IS SUPOUSE TO HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT IT IS NOT THERE. NOTHING ABOUT CURES. ALL THAT THE BOOK HAVE IS REFERENCE TO A WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT IS SUPOUSE TO BE IN THE BOOK BUT FOR YOU TO ACCESS THAT INFORMATION HAVE TO PAY 500 BUCKS FOR A LIFELONG SUBSCRIPTION OR 10 DOLLARS FOR A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION. SO THE BOOK IS A HOOK FOR YOU TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE WEBSITE. THAT IS A FRAUD.
1,First things first,"First:There is no such thing as ""alternative"" medicine. Something either works, in which case it is medicine, or it doesn't, in which case it is quackery.Second:Many agents seem to work because of the placebo effect (if you don't know what this is, look it up). ""They"" conduct extensive double blind clinical studies to separate the quakery from the medicine, and to eliminate the placebo effect. This is expensive and time consuming, but results in products that provide real cures. The average life-expectancy in this country has increased by over 30 years in the past century. People no longer die of smallpox, cholera, TB, typhoid fever, etc. becasue ""they"" cured them.This is a book of quackery."
4,"They"" Don't Want You To Know About","Excellent book that defines the wicked relationship between the drug companies, food proceesing companies, corporations, FDA, and our congressmen and senators. The witches brew of corruption has poisoned our food supply, our medical care and will soon be eliminating our nations supplement industry,.Many excellent references, life changing habits, cautions and strong suggestion. He shows the sharp line between the alopathic (drugs & surgery) and the holistic (natural)methods of treating disease and injury. Mr Trudeau has discovered what has happened to the health of our nation and gives more that just good suggestions on how to take back you life and the lives of others.My only complaint, is that his book has too many references to new age type cures. But that may be because we still do not understand them. Bruce"
3,Natural Cures,"Author long winded and repetitive, but does give valuble insights. I think the book could have weighed about 2 pounds less if he would just get to the point."
5,book review,"This book finally said something I have always thought to be true. Stress can cause illness. I guess doctors don't want to say that's a cause because there is no ""procedure"" to get rid of it. Many other useful things in the book."
1,Horrible Book - A Sucker's Paradise!,"This book is a crude imitation of an information source. The book was clearly written by a ranting, immature mental patient.There are NO CURES in this book.There is NO TRUTH in this book.If you buy it after reading this, you are an idiot and deserve to have your money stripped away to fund Trudeau's next money-making scheme.Get a clue...any pitch that contains the words, ""amazing, incredible, unbelievable, easy, instant, or quick"" is a fabrication designed to take advantage of your lazy, impatient, gullible (...)!Do you want to lose weight? Eat right and exercise!Do you want to feel better? Eat right and exercise!Do you want to feel better about yourself? Eat right and exercise!Where's my money Trudeau? Scumbag..."
1,What BS!!,"So he looks at homeopathic medicine and tells you to eat organic. (Like I have the money and time to eat organic 24/7) Well duh - didn't need to spend the money for that. Plus some of his info is just plain wrong!! Leads me to cast doubt upon all of it - if some of it I know is wrong - why should I trust what else he has to say?He gives us the debunked b-s that AIDS is not due to HIV. Gives Peter Duesburg as source on that. That idiot has been debunked over and over. Just because you can't trust our government doesn't mean you throw all science away.Yeah, I think Kevin has found a way to sell snakeoil...The book is a huge ad for his newsletter..."
1,worst book you'll ever see,"I did not read the whole book. I only read a few pages at Barnes and Noble. The critics are only half right. There are plenty of suggestions in this book. The problem is, they are incredibly stupid. Don't use deodorant. Avoid bad news from TV and newspapers. Shower in purified water. I'd rather have diabetes, asthma, and high cholestrol than do the time and money consuming things on this list. I'm fat, but I dont blame Wendy's or KFC(as Mr. Trudeau does). Other than that, Mr. Trudeau goes on with mindless rambling about how greedy pharmecutical corporations are(as if we didn't know that already). Following Mr. Trudeau's advice will lead to paranoias and phobias of all sorts. Mr Trudeau and his followers belong in the same category as David Koresh and Jonestown. I'm really scared that these people have the right to vote."
5,INSIGHTFUL BOOK,"Great insights in this book! I always wondered why there were not other solutions besides traditional medicine being created and used more often. I remember many years ago seeing an interview on TV about a gas additive that would increase gas mileage to 50 to 60 miles per gallon for every car, they said they would not sell out to big corporate interests..... but we don't have this product do we.The things he said about big business controlling our lives and government ""regulation"" to keep us ""safe"" but dying and others rich off it, seems very true. There really is no other logical explanation.I have told my friends about this book and feel it should something everyone should read to get more informed so you can really help your self if you get sick or just want to stay healthy."
1,ROFLMAO!!!,"I was just reading through all the reviews, and I see review after review with 1 star, then viola, suddenly there is a 5 star rating.However, if you click on the little link that says 'read all my reviews', all of those 5 star reviewers have only ever reviewed this book.Kevin, the gig is up. You are nothing more then a latter day snake oil salesman. You should be ashamed of yourself for taking advantage of people simply looking for a way to get better.Better take your aloe vera with you, Kevin. You are gonna burn."
1,Ripoff! Amazon ought to be ashamed for selling this book,What a total waste of your money. I bought this for my Father-in-law as a present. He had seen the commercial and wanted it. He was rather mad when he found out that they wanted more money to join the website to buy discounted vitamins and junk.What a shame!
5,No hidden agenda,"Read the book and was surprised to find out Mr. Trudeau does not sell his ""product line"" of vitamins, machines, what have you. In fact I was surprised not to find some order form in the back of the book. So I went back to the beginning and read it again not waiting for the hidden agenda, he convinced me to make some changes in my life style."
5,"After seeing the one star reviews, I bought it!","Obviously Kevin Trudeau is shaking things up and going after the right kind of people who are hoping to use your ignorance for their bliss. After seeing all the one star reviews being posted here, I had to buy this book. I just got it at my local Borders.I am also into stock market trading and will be shorting many of the drug and food companies. Want to get a little revenge on these multi-billion dollar companies? Short their stocks and ride em down.Good book regardless of whether you buy it from Borders, BAMM, Barnes"
5,Worth reading,"Here's what I'd like to write about this book. It has conspiracy, it has crimes, it has confessions and it has some darn good ideas. Some ideas I've already tried and found them to be very helpful. It may not be perfect and sometimes I don't agree, but can you ever get 2 people to agree 100% any time?I've tried all kinds of OTHER ideas and products from other people & sources that have not worked for me. What I know is no one thing works for everbody all the time. The book is under 20 bucks and 20 bucks is not too much to pay for ONE good idea. This book has many good ideas and suggestions. Check them out with your nutritionist and get a second opinion. Try them out yourself and give them time to take effect.This book is definitelly worth the read."
1,Natural Cures They Don't Want you toknow about Missed the Mark,"Basically I looked forward to getting his book as I read lots of holistic medical reviews and books. I was extremely disappointed and did not feel it provided concrete information to substantiate any claims. Statements in it were all generalized and of no real use to me. He points fingers and smears government agencies so much and is so argumentative, that you really need to wonder if he just has an axe to grind or just uses it for publicity effect. HIs book gives many examples of areas that makes you really want to know how MS or heart problems can be cured, but he falls short in giving you any real advice. I do not recommend his book."
5,Change your life,When I was reading this book I got the picture of what is going on with the pharmaceutical companies and the way I look at a healthy life style. I hate to admit but I had no idea that there was so many bad things in our food. And I thought if a doctor gives you something it must be good. I think everyone should read this book and I can tell you I am going to read some of the other ones he talks about.
5,Good book for a first one written on health,"This is Mr. Trudeau's first book, second edition. It is obvious in places that he is not using a professional editor. He will certainly draw critics from that alone. On the other hand, this book was written with heart and lots of passion.I truly believe he means every word. Most persons who know anything about natural health and healing would already be familiar with a lot of what he talks about. For the millions who are sheep, watching and listening to the almost every-other TV commercial advertising some drug or another and then taking those drugs thinking they are going to get better, this will be new and interesting information.Even a veteran of health can find the tidbit of new info in this book. Kevin does a nice job of tying all the information together to complete the picture of what is happening in this country. I give it an over all 5 stars."
5,YES--Truly A Very Powerful Endorsement by former FDA Commissioner!,"Anytime a former FDA Commissioner comes out with a statement, it means you are getting the truth because they are no longer at the mercy of the people they used to serve.In the case of this FDA Commisioner, it is true he died 3 years before this book was written....BUT...Kevin Trudeau has been a part of the Natural Health Movement for over a decade and this former FDA Commissioner was aware of Mr. Trudeau's work.YES....A very powerful endorsement."
1,What a scumbag...,"All he is doing is scaring people out of pursuing legitimate medical treatment for potentially lethal illnesses just so he can make a buck. How is this at all an admirable quality? He isn't exposing any sort of conspiracy. He isn't offering any sort of proven cures. All he is offering is one big advertisement for his website, and in trying to make money like this, possibly indirectly causing the deaths of people who don't know better."
2,Impracticle,I was disappointed by the author as I had brought the book with quite a lot of expectation. The author recommends us to live our life in such a protected manner that it is actually hilarious. Well it is opposite of my philosophy which says that one should be strong internally to be able to take care of anything that is dealt to us.
5,My whole family is changing over to healthy eating,I have a large extended family. After reading parts of this book to them we had a family meeting and voted to change what we eat. Even grandpa Pedro was agreed. We donated what we had in the pantry to a needy family and started researching better foods and where to get them economically. We now have it figured out to almost the same amount we were spending before yet we are eating so much better. We have enjoyed trying new recipes. Even the kids have been interested (for the most part) It has brought us a little closer as a family and that is a good thing. Thank you Mr. Trudeau.
1,bad,"bad...America needs to get some common sense and stop buying anything that promises them something unrealistic. if you bought this book, you deserve to be out 30 bucks. learn, and use common sense."
1,bogus hyped up nonsense,I agree with many others--you can read this book in 5 minutes standing up in the bookstore and get its two sentences of obvious advice. Save your money for real books.
2,the mother of all conspiracy theories,"this book contains a few useful guidelines about healthy eating and living but then goes on to rally against tap water , toothpaste , microwaves and every medication or drug ever invented.. also endless requests to subscribe to a web site to get more information from a man who claims to be uninterested in money ... a bit hypocritical and possibly dangerous for those who choose to believe the information contained without critical thought"
2,Natural Cures they dont want you to know about,"After reading through the material, it seems that the writer is overly paranoid about dying. we do not agree about his disregard for the taking of vitamins. Most of ""the cures"" are not expained fully. We are sorry we spent so much money on it:( NPb"
5,Good Book!,Thanks so much Mr. Trudeau for writing this book. I've never written a book review before so I hope this makes sense. My girlfriend been really depressed lately and I was really freaking out about it. A friend had the book and showed me some things in it that could help. She got off the drugs the other doctor had given her and that was a big help and then taking the walks everyday were really good too. Thanks again she is pretty happy now.
3,Much ado about nothing,"Although obviously well researched, this tome lacks meat. Hiding behind the threat of lawsuits, thie author gives no information about specific alternatives to big pharm. What he has done is create a catalog of web sites all of which seem to want to sell the viewer something. I had hoped for specific information about what works."
1,crock,This is the worst book i ever read.Thank God someone gave it to me.I would feel bad if I had paid for it.God Bless those who reached out to Kevin for help and got robbed instead.Shame on you.DONT BUY THIS TRASH
1,Thx to you all for saving me $54.00!!!,"I was all hyped up after watching his infomercial and was all set to buy 2 copies of the book (so I could be twice as ripped off). I want to thank each and every one of you who tipped me off that the book didn't contain what the infomercial said it would contain. In my opinion, Trudeau made specific claims about what I would be receiving and it wasn't references to a website where I could pay more for the information!What a ripoff! Somebody should call the FTC on this clown! (Irony intended)Again, thanks to you all!"
4,"Informative, but still lacking...","This book made me think twice about the purchases I make. It opened up my eyes and now I am more aware of the harm that some of today's products can cause. I never favored the option of prescription drugs knowing that there are so many side effects that go along with them. They treat the symptoms of one thing and often help to create some other disease or sickness to worry about. This book reassured me that prescription drugs are overrated.Natural Cures does give you information on what you can do to never get sick again along with how to lose weight effortlessly, and has a list of over 100. Most of the things that are listed are informative, but there are a few times where it says to look on his website and email him. He often claims that the FDA wouldn't allow him to place some information in his book. If you are concerned about living a healthy life then I would consider this book."
5,It opened my eyes to educate myself.,"For years, I have heard some of this information and chose to ignore it. Since reading it, I have checked out probobly 30 books from the library covering the same issues in much more depth. Since Nov. when I read the first edition, I have made many changes and will continue to make my lifestyle healthier. I feel great about my choices and finally realize it is my responsiblity to take my health into my own hands.I was also frustrated about all the references to the website. But the information is out there; Search the internet, read more books. What this book does do is bring out a lot of really beneficial information. What we do with it is up to us."
1,"Dishonest, Criminal, Empty","I bought the book at full retail. What an embarrassment. Sucker, one born every minute. Should've read the reviews first on Amazon (the negative ones act like a Better Business Bureau). Kevin is good at motivating/hype, but all the promises are completely empty. Seems he doesn't want you and I to know what these natural cures are any more so than the FDA, etc. You can you pay for access to his website, only to possibly show that you are twice the sucker that you were when you bought his book."
1,This book is a acam,"I returned the book, and received a refund. There is no way one could seriously beleive this guy. ""I think the line regarding him being in the CIA and he just letting it fall by saying "" I will make no further comment"" is a classic.If someone takes his views on skin cancer and the sun seriously you really need to do further research.He is a quack, hustler and a sharp marketing guy, but a medical expert that is funny."
5,Control over my health from now on,I am taking back control of my health. At first I found this book a little overwhelming. Then I started with just one or two of the wonderful suggestions from chapter 6... then one by one I was able to add more.Now I am doing much better health wise. Also I feel informed and have gone on to do more of my own research to make more improvements to my health. This was a great book to read. It got me a lot more interested in my body and changed what I thought a normal healthy body was.
5,Very Important to Read,"Quite intense at times, this book will totally change your understanding about the role of the regulatory agencies and whether they have your best interest, or possibly someone else's best interest at heart. I learned so much from this book, and refer to it often when conversations come up with friends about the topics covered. Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to understand why and how instead of just following the herd. Lots of research and inside information is revealed here that everyone should know before they trust that prescription they just got handed to them. Knowledge is definitely power here."
3,Interesting read,"Perhaps a little more evidence based research is needed to truly test these ideas for symptomatic relief of symptoms. We need to remember to treat the disease, not just treat the symptoms."
1,Warning - Spam Reviews!,"These ""perfect"" reviews aren't real! They're all being posted every few minutes. Just keep refreashing your browser, and you'll see for yourself!"
1,RECOMMENDATION SPAMMERS???,Anyone who manages to read all the way through any 5 STAR review of this trash can see that the review is nothing but SPAM!
3,"Just info , no cures","I'm not sure what ppl expected from this book. Wake up people, NO book is going to cure you overnight. This book sheds light on the risk factors for illnesses and on the business/political machines that run the health care/drug industry. It makes sense to me. Use this book as a springboard to seek more info not as a quick fix solution."
1,"Natural cures ""They don't wnat you know to about","I sent the book back, I was very disappointed. I expected suggestions, not to have to look them up on the internet. I believe some of the things he suggested to do to get and stay healthy were unreasonble."
2,No answers for diabetics,The title of the book and the infomercial are very misleading. I don't know where else to get the information you seek but it isn't here. What he tells you on the infomercial is about all the info you will get. I haven't been to the web sites he reffers to but I have a feeling there is just as much smoke and mirrors there as there is in the book.I was very dissapointed not finding the answers he said were in the book. However there are many other health concerns the book addresses and provides excellent and very specific actions to take.
1,Quackery,"This guy is full of it. I guess ""they"" just couldn't stop this book. Check out the article at www.randi.org for more on this guy. He's the Scumbag of the universe!"
1,Natural Cures he Contiunous Not to Tell U About,"I would give this book a negative five. He does not give you any cures. He writes about giving you cures if you go to his web site. By the way, you have to pay for it. The book is a big commercial. I think I will resell my copy. This book really, really, sucks. Don't waste your money. Don't even buy my copy!"
1,"Natural Cures ""They "" Don't want you to know About.",spend almost half of the book attacking the FDA and others goberment departments and about the cures say too litle to late.
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not what I expected. The suggestions for the ""natural cures"" seemed a bit far fetched. It seemed to me that that author was paranoid."
5,absolutely incredible!!!,"this guy is genius! he should be called DR.kevin . the ideas in this amazing book are literally outstanding. get this book now and read for yourself the powerful secrets to free health and wellness derived from natural methods like fruits, veggies,sleep,magnets,colon cleanse,juices,water,affirmations,and much much more!kevin is a man of truth and yes he has made mistakes in the past but so have you and i,is it not? i give a hundred stars to kevin for speaking more truth than any doctor or minister regarding healing and health! this book is a must read for every human being and may GOD richly bless this author,the man of TRUTH."
5,I live for food,I love to eat. I have had a weight problem all my life. For the first time ever I have started to lose weight thanks to Kevin Trudeau. I understand things now I could never grasp before. Now I eat healthier eat as much as I want and am still losing weight and feeling great. Just switching to organic and eating less sugar did the trick plus adding lots of water. Wow. I have hope for my body for the first time ever.
1,Garbage,"I have nothing new to add to the many one star reviews already out there. However I am so disappointed with this book and the fact it contains NOTHING but an invitation to hand over more money to this guy for what you already paid for, that I just had to add my vote. Forget the FDA and FTC, the FBI should arrest this man for false advertising. I'm sure he'd be protected by free speech, so here's my free speech ""buyer beware!""Go find the same book by an author that isn't an infomercial scam artist."
1,Attention: Scam!!! Thanks for the warning.,"I, too, gave the minimal score of one point...otherwise I'd give none. Thanks to all that wrote about their experiences with this book and website. I saw the infomercial and it sounded like an interesting, informative read. When researching where to buy this book, I came to Amazon, known for one of the best websites for reviews. Thanks to those reviews, I saved myself the cost of this $30 book. I agree with others, there are tons of books out there, written by honest authors, that describe herbs and foods and their natural medicinal purposes. The Federal Trade Commission website has additional info on this guy, as it seems he has made a career as a scam artist. Fortunately he's getting caught and paying the price, but unfortunately at the consumer's loss where I doubt most could afford to throw their money away."
1,Schyster indeed,"The cover of the book says it ""includes the natural cures for more than 50 specific diseases."" But after 355 pages, Trudeau writes: ""It's important to know that people who are looking for a specific cure for a specific disease are missing the point of this book."""
3,Ouch! Production value please!,"I listened to this the other day and Kevin's um's... you know's... and mispronunciations are intrusive to his message. He and his producer should have spent more time cleaning this up for an audio book release.Aside from production value the information in the book is interesting. It makes you test your beliefs about the FDA and drug companies, which isn't a bad thing. Yet, don't expect cited sources at the end of the book. That is a wish and prayer. It's all his advice and personal opinions."
1,"Old, reliable rule of thumb:","Like any great salesperson, Mr. Trudeau makes good use of many pursuasion techniques. It is very enticing to buy into a good conspiracy theory. Especially if it involves demonizing the ""establishment"" or ""leading experts"" that you may already be frustrated with, or suspicious of. Always be cautious of an old formula employed in this book: play up the readers' emotions with negative, biased, and outrageous claims against commonly trusted authorities...then point out how ""the salvation"" can be offered through the author's ""inside information"" the average Joe has no clue about, or is too stupid to care.I always follow this old rule of thumb: Be wary of any book whose (sometimes hidden) goal is to demonstrate just how special the author is."
1,Do not buy this book.,"Do not waste your money. Buy a book written by Kenneth Cohen, Honoring the Medicine, instead.Altho' I do agree that the drug industry is corrupt I do feel that this book is a sneaky way of trying to get more money out of a consumer. The author refers EVERYTHING back to his web site which requires you to spend even more money for the info that I thought was within the book!I give this book a minus 10 points. Mr. Trudeau - I want my money back."
2,N.D. says save your money,"I am a Naturopathic doctor and Ph.D. Nutritionist in practice for over ten years.If you TRULY want to educate yourself about natural healing, read all the books written by the late Bernard Jensen. Dr Jensen was a Naturopath, Nutritionist and Chiropractor and a SAINT of ""complimentary"" (formerly known as quack) medicine. His programs are all there for you..no websites, hidden fees or scams. He was the REAL DEAL!I have a cancer patient who was almost killed by excessive chemotherapy which destroyed her white blood cells. She went on a natural program and is cancer free over ten years later. People say natural healing doesn't work and they point to folks like Steve McQueen.. I point to people like John Wayne and Peter Jennings and say ""Chemotherapy doesn't work, either!!"" It takes a regimen of common sense..chemo and Natural programs can work together, properly administered!"
1,This book is a joke,"I cannot believed that this so-called consumer advocate got me to buy his book so he could tell me nothing about natural cures and only promote his website which he says in the book is where all the information is. Problem is the website requires a fee. This book is a scam and now I feel like an idiot for wasting my money on it.Take my advice: buy another book, or at least not buy this one."
1,you've got to be kidding,People please don't buy this book and give this sham artist any more money. This book is the biggest bunch of crap I have ever seen. I saw him on the Today show too and he can't answer any reasonable question with any amount of knowledge. This is just another scam to get your money because people want to believe in stuff like this. Don't waste your time.
5,true,i am writing this review to share my thoughts about this book with fellow amazon readers. I highly recommend you read this book. Congratulations to Mr Trudeau on having the strength and insight to write should a great book.This has been a life changing experience for me - i feel more energized already.
5,Don't drink the water,"It used to be that when you left the country to go to places like Mexico...you knew not to drink the water. Well it is sad that now we should not even drink our own water-never mind Mexico's water. I have not been drinking tap water for the last 10 years, but I was doing it mostly because I did not like the taste, more than what was in it. This book opened my eyes on the subject of water and many others. It is a good book to read."
3,Still a good read...,"Kevin Trudeau is a profit seeking man just like any other person in America. He may have taken his greediness a bit far in his book ""Natural Cures"", but there is still a lot of valuable information in this book. The book is slightly redundant and most of the important information is on his website, for a fee. I basically consider this book a collection of research because most of this information is all over the web. So if you would like to save hours of researching the health benefits of apple cider vinegar, raw coconut oil, and mangosteen juice then this book is definitely worth the $20. But if you are looking to cure a major disease overnight, save your money."
1,5 Star Reviews Every Few Minuets,Back track to the original rveiws. They are overwhelmingly low star ratings. Trudeau's sales are very low in fact. He has obviously hired people to write a lot of 5 star posts. If you are on between 11-3 (Central time) you see these reviews suddenly poppiong up. Interesting. But the ploy is bound to fail and the only one giving these hight ratings are just these stoogie.You deserved the jail time Kevin. You are a criminal.
1,Fraudulent claims,"I encourage anybody who is fooled by Kevin Trudeau to file a complaint with the FTC. If you are thinking of buying this book, do some research on Trudeau. He is a felon and a disreputable (...).No specific ""natural cures"" are enumerated in this book. For the record, nor does vinegar cure acid reflux."
1,"buy my book, buy my cures, nothing more than a diversion to his web site","After reviewing this clown's book, and visiting his web site, I made a conscious decision not to bother buying this garbage. It is nothing more than a blantant push to visit his website and buy buy buy! How can intelligent readers pursue such patooee!"
1,Another Trudeau Scam on the Public,"I have to agree with Vincent. There is nothing of substance in this book. What cures? He won't tell you. He names a few different cleanses that he says are crucial yet he won't tell you how to make them. He just refers you to his website, where for $9.50 a month you 'might' find the answers. I have my suspicions that he'll even charge you more after you've paid the monthly fee. It's all about the money.I'm sure the FTC will be looking at him for misrepresenting the contents of this book. It's nothing more than a huge infomercial that you're paying to read. If nothing else, this book shows everyone that Kevin's cares nothing about you, your health, or your well being. All Kevin wants is your Money and you get nothing of value in return.I would rate this book 'DO NOT BUY'"
1,Glad I just checked it out from the library,"I wanted to read this book because I thought (as the title suggests) it would give natural ways to treat illnesses. Instead, the author filled the pages with conspiracy theories, ranting, raving, and repetition. The version I read kept mentioning that he believes there is a natural cure for everything, but he did not mention any of these natural remedies. As the others have said, he is doing exactly what he accuses the drug companies and food companies of -- trying to make even more money. Don't go to his website - it is as useless as the book."
1,Fraud,"A dishonest book from someone with a history of misleading infomercials. This book asserts: ""The sun does not cause cancer. Sun block has been shown to cause cancer."" That's just nonsense."
1,natural cures they don't want you to know about,"I watched the infomercial and, being diabetic, I could not wait to call the number to order. After turnng down at least six pitches for other junk, I told them to cancel the order. I got a copy from Amazon.com and could not believe the garbage I was reading. The only cure was for the authors wallet. I will put it in the bathroom where it will be put to good use, one page at a time! I'm sure at some point in Kevins life he sold abused cars or possibly comes from a long line of snake oil salesmen!Don't waste your money."
1,Rip Off,"This book has absolutley no natural cures listed in it, what this book does do is try to get you to spend more money. In my opinion all Trudeau has to say is how bad the FDA is without offering any solutions, save your money. I will never buy anything by the author Kevin trudeau again."
1,Very Dissappointed,"This book is just an advertisement. I just wasted $30.Its too bad, because I know first hand that doctors don't want to know about natural cures...I'm living proof. Having cured myself of psorisis (with the help of a naturopathic doctor) a few years ago, I have gone to several dermotologists for unrelated issues. None of them (over 5...we move around) were at all interested in a cure. They certainly wanted my money when I needed treatment.I will have to find alternative methods others ways...as I won't waste anymore money on Kevin Trudeau."
1,young single mom dooped,"I have a 6 year old son with ADD.I am over weight, suffer from heart problems, and parts of my body have cancerous....and so on. I got this book hoping that it could help me. to most people 30 dollars is not a lot. but i am a single low income mother. the only thing this book did was make me even more worried about the food i feed my family. he did not tell me how to help my son or my self. and he takes even more of your money to join his web page that isnt even fully constructed yet. there are many many free web pages that help you. and i found them after buying his book. he has just mannaged to put more feer in the allready cautious comsumers. he talks about greed, ya... he knows best. it takes a greedy person to know one. i should have known better but i had hope and he pulled it out from under me."
1,Hoax,"Don't waste your money. No natural cures are in the book as advertised other than some common sense, which we all already know, just choose not to do. The author is repeating the same thing throughout the book...to pay him more money by going to his website and getting answers to what you already supposedly bought. The real kicker is that he claims everyone else is in it for the money, but he is not."
1,Do not buy this book,"I would repeat this 1,000,000 times if given the space to do so. This is the first scam I've allowed myself to be sucked into because his advertisement/infomercial was effective with its high promises and golden claims. I now remember why I abhor infomercials.[...]This IQ-lowering book is not only completely devoid of any natural solutions but is also poorly written and reads like a paranoid street man would preach from his garbage bin pulpit in a dark alley. If you're going to scam us, Mr. Trudeau, you could have at least made the story more interesting."
5,Kevin Trudeau has their number...,"Kudos to Kevin.I especially appreciate his exposing the FDA. It's difficult to believe the gestapo tactics they employ. Is this America?Would expect to hear about something like that in North Korea or Cuba.Isn't is amazing that doctors never ""prescribe"" supplements or vitamins that will help your body heal itself. The only function drugs have is to take care of symptoms - not to improve the health of the body.Keep at it Kevin. You have the bravado and ethics lacking in our congressmen and government.PJB enough is enough"
1,This book is a rip off,"I can't believe I wasted money on this book. I agree..that our country is overweight, the pharma industry and the FDA are not effective and that the food companies pump us with processed food. What this author has done is make money off of this and provide no information. Spending $[...] on his book isn't good enough. He wants you to spend more money to get the information you though you would be getting for the price of the book. What a hussler. I am returning this book."
2,"Same old, same old!","This book is based on using natural foods and vitamins, also, cleansing the system. The cost to cleanse my husband's and my system, (takes about a month)was $150.00! Needless to say this program is NOT for retired or middle class people. Natural foods and vitamins are a lot more expensive than the regular."
5,Out of the mouths of babes!!,"- One day my daughter asked me ""Mommy, why do you take so many drugs, I thought drugs were bad?"" Even though they were prescriptions I had to sit down on that one. I didn't like the message I was teaching her by example. When my mother told me about this book the next day I truly believed it to be a sign. Reading the book changed the way I handle my health and I'm off ALL those drugs."
5,USA toxic waist or waste land?,Kevin Trudeau exposes the evils of Government and drug companies conspiracies that have turned the USA into the land of the toxic waist as well as only being motivated by the almighty buck. After reading this book I can't walk into a grocery store anymore and find more than one or possibly two isles that actually have any food at all that is edible. I shop at three different stores to find enough Organic food to eat at a reasonable price. I thank Kevin for making me a much wiser consumer. My waist is deminiting while I only see others increase in size. I am much more selective on how I spend my buck.
2,"Natural Cure ""They don't want you to know about","interesting information, but the author is trying to sell himself as a super hero who wants nothing in return, except that you can't get anything off his web site without spending money to enroll. People who have limited incomes might as well forget all about getting healthier, this book is for people with money. So not only are you being hurt by the pharmacutical companies, but also by the ""person"" who is trying to save you. I read the book and received some useful info. I wouldn't recommend people spending their money unless they have more to spend."
1,Conspiracy Theorist Rant,"I was disappointed with Kevin Trudeau's heart-felt masterpiece. I thought there was going to be more scientific fact and evidence to support his claims, however the majority of his views are simply home-cooked gibberish."
5,Rest is a healthy thing to do!!!!!,"In the section of the book on ""Why Are We Sick?"" I found the part about Rest caused me to stop and rethink my previous attitude that sleeping was a bit of a waste of time. Any time I have gone to a doctor about an illness they have never asked me about my sleep habits. This is only one of the simple concepts in the book that got my attention. These simple concepts can be hard to put into life. Seems to me everyone should read this book and we all need to agree to a better way of life."
5,One less kid on drugs,"My sister has had trouble with her 9 year old son since he started school. I have always been against drugging kids and had managed to keep her from giving in to the school system for a long time. Recently her son had been having even more and more behavior problems in school. The pressure was on to drug her son because the school ""authorities"" were telling her that it would help him. I had just read Kevin's book so I begged her to read it before she made any decision. I had been telling her for years my viewpoints on what she should do with her son, but it fell on deaf ears. After reading this book, she promised me she would not let them drug her son and she is actively seeking out natural cures and reading other books on alternative solutions. There's one kid less who will be drugged and that was worth every penny I spent on the book."
1,What Kevin Trudeau Doesn't Want You to Know,"The most important thing worth noting about this book: Trudeau does NOT tell you what the ""secret cures"" are; instead, he gives you an internet address that you can pay a subscription to access that will reveal the secrets. He writes that the FTC doesn't want him to make the ""secrets"" public. Well, that's sort of true -- as part of an agreeement he made with the FTC, he would stop making false claims.He also fails to mention having been brought to court many times for false advertising or having been convicted for credit card fraud and a few other things. However, this book will definitely appeal to people that believe conspiricy theories. Do yourself a favor, just do a web search on his name and see what you come up with; afterall, the whole world can't be in on the conspiricy --- or can they? :)"
1,Deception with a smile,"This book offers some of the most ridiculous and unsubstantiated arguments I have ever laid eyes on. Trudeau offers some sharp arguments, that will- guaranteed- to raise some eye-brows, but unfortunately, he offers no evidence for his outlandish claims. For instance, he says that sun block AND NOT the sun causes cancer, and it's a huge conspiracy...why? Well just because he says so...sigh. Anyone in medicine, biology, and even physics, will understand how that is possibly one of the most single-minded, fear-mongering, rhetoric pseudo-academia has ever dish-out. A waste of time!"
1,Zero Stars,"This book is nothing more than a nurtritional guide, if that. All this talks about is food that you most likely are eating anyway. But my major concern is saying that all these food cures diseases. There are some medical problems that require medication and no food is going to change this. You need to take this book with a grain of salt. But I do admit that eating more healthy might allow you to lessen the medication you take. Also, I didn't like the way Kevin presented his book and arguement for why you should buy his book. He claims that the government and big business is evil. Well I can't argue that. However, Kevin has made over 2 BILLION Dollars in marketing his products. Sounds like Kevin also has something to gain and you have something to be careful of."
1,he HAS TO FACE JESUS CHRIST 1 DAY IS MONEY WORTH IT KEV HERES THE SCRIPTURE,AS IT SAYS IN YOUR INSTRUCTION MANUAL IT IS EASIER FOR A CAMBELL TO GO THREW THE EYE OF A NEEDLE THEN FOR A RICH MAN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD NOW THATS A NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER IF YOU READ MY REVIEW WHICH YOU WILL YOU CAN CONTACT ME AT BENZORECOVERY@YAHOO.COM NO CHARGE MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL KEVEN KEEP LIEING FOR MONEY YOU GOTA FACE HIM BROTHER GOD BLESS
3,just ok,"I understand what a lot of people are saying about this book. He gives very little information on curing diseases like he claims. He does have good points in the book however, but I did feel his self promotion over shadowed the point behind it. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it made me want to do my own investigating. That alone has led me to a wealth of knowledge about different ailments and possible ""cures"". I guess in general it gave me hope that we are in control of our own health no matter what may happen. I wouldn't recomend purchasing the book, as you can find so much more information just surfing the web."
1,Total Garbage,"This is what I compare this book to:Joe:""I know how to make you healthy"" Moe: """" How?"""" Joe: ""Simple, exersize, if you want to know what exersize to do, pay me an extra $10 per month so I can tell you.""Thank GOD i skimmed through the book at barnes and nobles. If you want a good book that does not try to sell you a website then try out : Food-Your Miracle Medicinek by Jean Carper. It tells you facts straight up with out the garabage this Idiot Kevin trys to sell you.People like him make me sick. I wonder if there is a remidy in the Food book to cure us from people like him? :)"
2,"Less Rant and More Information, Please","Kevin spends most of the book ranting about the influence of food and drug manufacturers over the government. Well, tell us something that we do not know already. I appreciate Kevin Trudeau's trials and tribulations to get this information and deal with the bureacracies. But, let's move ahead. I felt ripped off when I mostly just read about ""they"" and a some references on getting a kidney, liver, etc. cleanse and practice tai chi. Well, thanks, but it would help to toss in some formulas and actual demonstrations instead of a bunch of websites. I am keeping the book for now, just for some websites. Otherwise, it is mostly one man's rant against the system. I received far more health information and entertainment from Dr. Duke's Essential Herbs."
2,70 years old?,"Kevin Trudeau wrote on page 17 of ""More Natural Cures Revealed"", ""By the way, although I look like I am in my early forties, I am really seventy years old...but that means nothing. The stuff in this book really doesn't work!"" That sent me to the web where I learned that he was born on Feb 6, 1963. What was that about? Don't think it was tongue in cheek. Books are filled with mostly ranting. Might be benefits in some of the things he recommends and the few products he mentions."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"Sorry folks, but I was very underwhelmed by the book. Most of this information is readily available in other books. In fact, he lists over a hundred of them in Chapter 12 alone!None of this information is hidden. Some of it is just plain common sense (reduce stress, hydrate, stop listening to bad news on the TV, avoid heavily processed foods, etc.)I don't like authors that prey on people's fears to make money. Go to your local library, do some research and visit your neighborhood whole foods/herb shop. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt and decide for yourself."
1,MAD AS HELL,"Kevin says ""He's mad as hell"". Well, after reading this book, I am mad as hell and I am not going to take it anymore! I am blowing the whisle on Kevin. He says he has a natural cure for just about everything... just go to his web site and pay $500!He starts talking about a great cure and to just go to his web site for more details. --- there are NO answers there!I believe that HE is the one that is profit-driven.I do not recommend this book."
1,Natural Cures They Don't Want You to Know About,"Not ""reader friendly."" A lot of it made no sense. Waste of money."
1,"""the truth about this book 'they' don't want you to know about""",pay me buttloads of money and i wont tell you
1,"Natural Cures ""They "" Don't Want You To Know About.",This writer(?) should be banned from TV! A waste of money. My grandmother could have told me more and better and helpful advice!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,What the author did not tell you about Natural Cures,"I eagerly waited for this book....what I received was a ""paper weight"". The informercial claims that there are cures listed in the book....what I received was an over priced ad for a web site..... why any one would subscribe to this website after being duked out of $40.00 is beyond me!!!Insanity is doing something again and again and expecting different results!!! I wasted my money!!!!Buyer Beware!!!!"
1,An un-Renaissance man,"When more emphasis is based on the dubious past of a particular writer, it makes the public hungry for more juicy, tabloid-esque bytes. To summarize, this author's quite the 'expert' - at removing you from your money quickly."
1,SCAM!,His cure for everything is a Candida cleanse but no where in the book does he tell you how to do a Candida cleanse..... thanks a bunch Mr. Scammer
1,Stockholm Sydrome,"My husband found this book at a garage sale and paid $1. for it. That was too much. I started reading it and found I was getting very depressed. Trudeau hits you over the head with his solid gold hammer, ranting about the FDA and other acronyms ad infinitum, ad nauseum, telling you to trust him and him alone, then go to his website where you can get into an 'exclusive'area to find out what he promised in this book. I felt as if he had kidnapped me, held me hostage until for my survival I was forced to identify with and depend upon him. I decided to access the user comments and was gratified to realize I was not alone. I broke free of my captor and will make it my goal to see that this guy does not continue to get away with what I consider 'attempted theft' of my psyche. I know he's laughing at us and laughing all the way to the bank. Makes me sad but what comes around goes around. Shame on you Kevin Trudeau."
5,I lost 15 lbs in 15 days. Thanks Kevin!,"After years of going nowhere with weight loss programs, I lost a quick and easy 15 lbs in 15 days. I followed Kevins advice. Did a candida and colon cleanse. Stopped eating at those places and those foods that were keeping me fat and addictive.I couldn't believe the junk that came outof me with the cleanse. Between inproper eating and all of those OTC and prescribed medications that certain people push on us, especially on me, I was loaded with toxins.Not only do I look better, I feel fantastic! Who wouldn't with all of that junk now out of my system. I am also using other remedies recommended by Kevin and they all work.Now I know who ""THEY"" are and why why ""THEY"" don't want us to know about natural remedies.Thanks a million Kevin and thanks for helping me lose 15 lbs. Oh, by the way, I am in my 50's and losing weight is almost impossible for people my age. Not when you follow Kevins advice."
1,FOR THE LOVE OF MAONEY,"Mr. Trudeau is obviously promoting his book for one reason, ""FOR THE LOVE OF MONEY"". Nothing wrong with that, except for the fact he is putting down others in his book for the very same reason. A little 2-faced in my opinion. There might be some truth behind his thoughts, yet not to the extent that he states them to be. If he is so against these people and since he is (in his words), ""so mad he's not going to take it anymore"", then why is he trying to suck others into his pay website. Another money making ploy. So sad!"
2,"Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You To Know About","While some good info was available, overall to wordy. only trying to bait you to the website. the docs noted in the book will only try to sell you something else. Never provided the info I inquired ablout. Customer service is horrible. ONE BIG SCAM!!!!!!"
1,No cure for being a sucker,"No cure for being a sucker should be the title of his book. After making a good argument as to the mating habits of the FTC, FDA, Pharmaceutical companies, and the American food industry, Kevin leaves the solution to the problem veiled behind a $9.95 a month website scam. He provides no solutions and no natural cures in his book. You must become a paying member of his website and news- letter. Once the money is paid at the website to become a member, the website doesn't work. All calls placed to the company were unreturned. All website submissions were ignored. It is a bogus company with misleading advertisement. It is fraud and should be investigated by the FTC, BBB, and the Department of Justice. By the way, anyone can file a complaint with the BBB for just two dollars. They will act on every complaint. Do not buy this book, and do not join his website unless you are a sucker for which there is no cure."
1,Horrible,This book is a waste of money. I found nothing of value in it. Wish i could get my money back.
1,I Hate to Buy Bad Books,I hate to buy bad books even if it is only for several dollars. I'm glad I readsome of the negative reviews and I didn't buy the book.
3,Great information,"Very informative and motivating to live better, eat right, and change attitudes. Love the audio also, very inspiring. I really learned alot about the right foods to eat."
3,Rated to many items,I am generaly satisfied with the purchases and service from Amazon. Almost all the items were as expected. Some i was not trying to buy the best just the best for the cost.
1,Before you read this book. Read This!,"Very Very disappointing! Full of propaganda ~ much of what the author writes is not verifiable due to the author's lack of citations. However, I was able to find additional information using google searches. Even some very interesting information about the author, search on ""Kevin Trudeau"" - a must ready. In any event, this book is the 'same old same old.' No new information and no cures or remedies. Just a bunch of recommendation to others (including scientology) and each will cost you additional money.FYI....I consider myself to be an intelligent person with a good common sense. I am also very inquisitive, which means I will read things that catch my eye ~ including this book, all 572 pages of it.I am not in the medical profession, nor am I a scientist. Of course what Kevin Trudeau presents in his book definitely is not rocket science, nor is it on the leading edge of healthcare. In my opinion -- it's not even educational!"
1,Con-artist that has been banned by the FTC,"Because of his lies and misinformation, Trudeau has been banend from making misleading, eroneous statements, like Coral Calcium is more efficient than milk and can cure cancer, high-blood pressure, and Lupus.This little man has made millions on this and is now in legal, financial trouble. You can google his name and the FTC to read more about him.It is appalling that he is targeting the vulnerable and ill of society and selling undoubtedly desperate people these lies.He's a worthless, poor excuse for a human being and should suffer one day soon the fate of those that have bought into his lies."
1,Thanks for the reviews,"I was just about to purchase the book thinking it would have all the cures in it. I was just watching his infomercial and was totally sold on it. I was thinking this is some kind of break through. After seeing my parents age and all the medications they are on and Diabetes running in my family I was going to check it out to find a cure or at least prevent it. Im not the type to accept everything the doctors say like its written in stone. On the other hand, medications may distroy us in some ways but we are also living longer these days. You just have to learn to be caucious and learn to do your own research. Now a days its right at our fingertips. Im just glad I read the reviews. Thanks!"
1,False advertising!!,"The title of this book is misleading. KT does not give you one single cure for anything! He bashs the FDA for most of the book (for the most part I agree with some of his theories, but the title is not FDA: What are they hiding?, is it?...) and the last few chapters are about common sense things like eat organic foods and drink spring water. No kidding! That's the secret to healthy living??The positive reviews for this book are bogus. Anyone with common sense will not have a life-altering experience from reading this book (see above for his ""secrets"" to live a long, healthy life. Duh!). What you will have is less money in your wallet and a useless book taking up space in your house, as well as a sense of betrayal for being taken in by a con.I ordered this book from his infommercial two years ago and returned it for a refund, minus the outrageous $9.95 shipping and handling charge, of course."
1,Some questions for Kevin Trudeau,"Kevin Trudeau claims he is not allowed to release the information about the exact ""natural cures"" for legal reasons.Bull.Type in a keyword like ""natural healing"" into your internet browser or go to your local bookstore. There are thousands of FREE websites and dozens of books with REAL natural cure information. How is it that they can share the ""real"" information but you can't, Mr. Trudeau?He then claims that people who are practicing natural medicine are getting raided and hauled off to jail, yet insists that everyone visit several different kinds of natural health practioners. Why aren't these natural practioners in jail or put out of business, Mr. Trudeau?There are many other websites and books with actual information about the cures. Read those instead of this book."
1,Misleading,"This man uses little bit of truth to couch out-and-out lies. He mentions bits and pieces of information that sound plausible and hopeful, but if you check them out, they fail to prove true. Don't waste your money."
2,Short on Natural Cures,"I only gave this book two stars because I felt that the title was misleading as to the books main content. Kevin repeats himself over and over. The book could have been cut in half.I have changed the way I eat as a result of reading this book. I do believe what he says about our food supply being full of chemicals and I also believe that it's ""all about the money"" when it comes to the drug companies."
1,Such a waste!,There is no natural cure for anything in this book. If you want to know he tells you to subscribe to his website for a monthly fee to find out what the cures are. Otherwise he tells you loads of stuff you already know if you have much common sense or interest in nutrition. He also tells you to practice Scientology/Dianetics! Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your money!
1,Fraud?,"Watch the infomercials, buy the book, subsribe to the website, subscribe to the newsletter, invest in the companion CD and what do you get?A repackaged regurgitation of free, publically available information.What don't you get? Your money back. If Trudeau is interested at all in ""natural cures"", ""holistic medicine"", or a better quality of life for you and your family, it's only because it makes him money.And that makes Kevin Trudeau one of ""them"".From MSNBC: ""Trudeau is no stranger to the courtroom. He's a convicted felon. In 1991 he pled guilty to credit card fraud - and has a long past of legal run-ins with federal regulators. In fact, he's barred from selling products on television now, as part of a 2004 settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations involving misleading statements surrounding health care products. Trudeau admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to stop selling health care products."""
1,This is a joke,"I bought this book thinking it was natural cures, all it was is a get rich scheme for the author. I am very disappointed. This definately is a case of misleading advertising.I would rate it at a -5. I don't know why Amazon carries this book."
1,SCAMMER on HIGH ALERT!!,Kevin Trudeau best known for his several years of prison time scamming people across the globe has another one here. PLEASE save your $$$$$. Not only will you own a worthless book of misinformation but you will be called regularly by his staff to order more books and newsletters etc.....(Harrassed is more like it). I received the book as a gift and personally have been through the gamut. Kevin's a master at marketing something that is useless drivel......Good luck!
4,Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About,I bought this book for a freind. He is verry happy with it.
1,fool the gullible and get rich!!,"I have a PhD in biochemistry and work for a major pharmaceutical company (the DEVIL!!). Trust me, folks, this is all nonsense. Has this guy ever even picked up a test tube??Many drugs come from ""natural"" sources anyway, so his point is moot. And also, people who work in this industry DO get cancer and heart disease...if any ""cover up"" was going on, it would be exposed real quick. I gotta give him credit for getting rich by promoting this junk, though!! While I slave away trying to find REAL cures, this guy is probably on a yacht!! There is no justice.."
1,An Idea,"I am watching his infommercial right now and so I came here to read the reviews. I think that it would be terrible to think you were getting information and then discover that all Kevin could say is ""The government forbids me to tell you about..."" So why doesn't Kevin just write a ""Fictional story"" about a woman (or man) who has all these ""crazy cures"" for diseases suffered by other people in the neighborhood. He could sell it as ""Fiction"", Free-Speech would protect him, people who were familiar with his work would know that the information was useful, and people wouldn't have to pay 10 bucks to access some website, which is the element of this situation that makes it feel like a scam. Just an idea!"
2,Glad to Have Saved Money!!!,"I was seriously interested in getting my hands on this book. I am, however, very grateful to have read the reviews 1st.I gave a 2 rating because some people actually gave a 5 star rating and I haven't read the book yet (I will soon but I won't buy it).Someone said that Kevin Trudeau is an exceptional salesman and that he could ""Sell sand at the beach,"" or something to that extent and I believe that some people got sold. Not scammed but sold, completely.The infomercial was the exact thing that won me over but I don't remember too many references to a website or any fees???? I remember a lot of references to the FDA and all he couldn't say.I don't believe that we're all looking for all the answers or quick fixes, I just believe that we were tremendously disappointed. I think some of us feel that the pharmacutical industry aren't the only ones looking for the money. So thanks for saving me the cash."
1,Beware of this man!,"Thank you Dr. Hunstenian! You give all of us a sense of hope and trust in yoru honesty. I am glad to know there are doctors like you.I just want to say that I saw Trudeau's infomerical late one night on TV and my first instinct was that he was a disingenuous man. I perused through hsi book at a local book store and although I have no medical background, knew what he was saying was ludicrous. The only thing more offensive in what he was claiming was the most sincere aspect of his person: namely his sincere belief people would soak up what he was saying.It is really disgusting what publishing companies have allowed to go to press today."
4,not bad,it has got a lot of natural cures for ear infections and sinus infections. it's not a bad book.
1,"Cancer Cure? Any Cures?..Yes, Scam","For those people who are raving about this book, let's make a couple of key points:1. Dr. Lay died three years ago, so he could have never read or endorsed the book. It is not possible! Something that people who rate the book, constantly mention that he did..Clearly, Kevin is a master of the Oujia board.2. The ""cure for cancer"" that he mentions on his shop america informercial, and says by this doctor. What he fails to mention is that doctor was a zoologist and it was some serum that was NEVER proven to cure cancer by anybody.3. That people are told to stop taking medications etc. for some serious or potential serious diseases. In the 1960's there was a high rate of people dying from Lupus. Today, as a result of medical drug treatments, more than 90% lead a normal live."
1,Yet Another Review,"Over 700 reviews and most of them bad ones. Yet people continue to buy the book and then write a nasty review as if they were shocked that the book didn't deliver what some infomercial promised. This book is a top seller, which means this scam artist is living nicely on money handed to him by foolish people who deserve to lose their cash for not taking the time to read a few reviews before buying the book in the first place! Kevin Trudeau ... a man living the American Dream. I just wish I had thought of it first!!"
2,Natural cures,"I suppose trudeau can include himself in the (they) that doesnt want you to no about these natural cures, there are some interesting points in this book but the more you read you get to here these points over and over on a regular basis but based on trudeaus past work maybe something other than him prvented this from becomeing what it should have been it seems censored or edited"
1,Con Job Posing as a Book,"The author continually makes unsubstantiated statements without the slightest reference, footnote or otherwise documenting his outlandish claims. At one point he asserts that chimpanzees in the wild live 3-4 times longer than humans. He is either lying, misquoting or knows of 240+ year-old chimps that no one else knows of. The book is an expensive rambling opinion most easily expressed in a single sentence, ""Modern medicine is bad, join my website to learn the truth.""What is most alarming is not simply the number of positive reviews for this worthless book but the number of reviewers who attribute negative reviews to a conspiracy of ""paid spammers"", ""paid Trudeau bashers"", ""a certain group of people (and/or agencies?) are stooping this low..."", etc..."
1,BOGUS!,"This book is GARBAGE, and Kevin Trudeau is a world-class SLEAZEBAG. He is truly a criminal and it is a tragedy that his book has been so successful. This man needs to be stopped.PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! DON'T GIVE TRUDEAU YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,This book is crap,"(...)To sum up this record - In 1990, he posed as a doctor in order to deposit $80,000 in false checks, and in 1991 he pled guilty to larceny after he had used his Mega Memory customers' credit card numbers for his own purposes. He spent two years in prison because of this conviction.There are other criminal endeavors on him, just check the website.This man has become a multi-millionaire by conning people of their money. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! You will just be another person taken advantage of."
1,Scam?,"I didn't buy the book here, I came just to read reviews on the book. So far what I'm seeing is consistant with what I know. I should not have bought the book. I did an internet search for the book after seeing the TV ad. One site stated they no longer sold the book, as it contained misleading information. I bought it anyhow because the auction I got if from had good ratings. I went back and read those ratings after I got the book and noticed that people were not saying the book was good, just that they got the book quickly. You do have to go to Kevin's website and pay to find the info you bought the book to learn. You can find the info without paying, by just doing a simple search for natural remedies on whatever illness, condition you want to cure for FREE. Or just buy on a book on herbs. They state what each one is good for. This book was a waste of money. I am very happy that Amazon let's people review books. I hope that this will help someone."
1,I've seen him on TV before...,"I doubt he even wrote this book. I've been him on TV before advertising the Atkins diet when it was popular and some other thing to increase memory. I guess because he has an honest face, people pay him to do commericials for them. He's not what he appears to be! The Book is a RIPOFF! Buyer Beware!"
1,Negative stars...wasn't this supposed to be about cures?,"I feel as if the infomercial was the best part...the book has nothing to do with anything...EXTREME false advertising. I AM sending my book back; I figure that even if I lose shipping/handling, I'm still up a few dollars."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"This book is laughable and I am embarrassed that I bought it. There are no natural cures, nothing to back up simply ridicules claims, just take the guy's word for it. The same basic content keeps repeating itself over and over. I should have carefully read the disclaimer.....""Heaven forbid someone reads these words and claims to be adversely affected by them, thus ensuring a barrage of lawsuits filed under the guise of protecting the unknowing victims who were stupid enough to read this and believe it!"""
1,Keeps changing his treatments,"When we attended this guy's seminars three years ago, just about all his cures involved hot towels and enemas. Now, these techniques are not so important. Either medical science changes even quicker than I thought, or this guy is a quack."
1,high priced rip off,"the entire book is author telling you that he can't tell you what ""They"" Don't Want You To Know About""....you must either buy more books or pay for an online news letter to find out.A sickening example of misleading advertizing to relieve you of your money."
1,Convict,"minus 5 stars for this book. he's IS a CONVICTED con artist, this was on Good Morning America, the other day. Amazon should pull this book, it is a rip off, and a waste of money. I got stuck with the shipping charges. I will do my home work for now on!!!"
1,Hack,"""Natural Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About"" is an embarrassingly bad book, revealing all aspects of utterly unscientific hackery. Trudeau claims that all modern conveniences are dangerous, but doesn't provide any alternative. Plus, the narrative is littered with ""I believe"" and ""I think.""In a truly delusional turn, Trudeau attempts to convince the reader that the FDA - which, he purports, is a government agency - is after him, along with all other sectors of the U.S. government, when the FDA is independent of the administration.He offers a bunch of unfounded voodoo cures for the illnesses that he himself had conceived and he is so steadfast in adhering to his own word that it's often frightening what kind of garbage can get published these days."
1,waste of my money,this book is in the realm of false advertising all this crook does is refer you back to his web site if you want any real advise or answers (which cost$$ to join).very uninformative all he does is complain about the govt.and i paid for this crap. less than 1 star rating.sign discusted.
1,no wonder the doctors never tell things like this,"I bought this book, and after reading few pages i threw it away. Aparently the author doesn't whant you to know it either,except he wants you to pay more money to find out each individual cure.. or more money to refer you to another web site. The book is total junk don't waste you money or time."
2,a joke,this is a book about the difficulties he had starting a business -- very little real information that would be useful. a waste of time and money.
1,Snake oil salesman- keep your money in your pocket,"Too bad there is not a - 0 rating. This garbage is nothing more than Trudeau's diatribe on continuously berating the government and big pharma as keeping secrets from the population all in the name of making a profit. A repeated line is ""it's all about the money"". There is likely a lot of truth in these words, however, coming from the clown Trudeau it makes the government look like an army of Sunday school teachers.The comedy is that the author offers an entire book on this subject while simultaneously and repeatedly routing readers to his web site to spend more money. In other words - it truly is all about the money, your money lining Trudeau's pocket. Spend the $30 on a good charity. At least you get personal satisfaction rather than getting ripped off by a snake oil peddler."
1,Convicted Scam Artist,Kevin Trudeau was convicted of scamming people out of millions of dollars. He is no longer allowed to sell anything but literature ( freedom of speech.) His book is just another rip off. Go to www.Quackwatch.com for details or simply do an internet search for his background.
1,WHAT A BUNCH OF GARBAGE!!!,"THIS BOOK IS NOT AN EYEOPENER, IT IS NOT EDUCATIONAL OR INFORMATIVE AND IT IS NOT A MUST READ!! ALL THE BOOK DOES IS TELL YOU TO EAT RIGHT AND EXERCISE.....OOPS, I SHOULDN'T HAVE REVEALED THAT INFORMATION TO YOU, NOW ""THEY"" WILL COME AFTER ME!! AND NOW YOU OWE ME $29.95 FOR THE INFO I JUST GAVE!SAVE YOUR MONEY. DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME READING A CHECKED OUT COPY FROM THE LIBRARY OR EVEN BROWSING THROUGH IT AT THE BOOKSTORE!ANYONE GIVING THIS BOOK A GOOD REVIEW IS PROBABLY KEVIN TRUDEAU HIMSELF (ALONG WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS)! A COMPLETE RIP-OFF!ANY STORE CARRYING THIS BOOK NEEDS TO PULL IT FROM THE SHELVES!THERE REALLY SHOULD BE A ZERO STAR RATING.....THIS ONE IS A DEFINITE ZERO."
2,Get it from the library BEFORE you spend your money...,"As a public librarian, I see people come into the library all the time asking about books they've seen on infomercials. A good example of this is the Matthew Lesko books. Folks don't realize all the work they have to do to get the ""free money,"" and borrowing the book from the library helps them realize the book is not all it's cracked up to be. It's the same with this book. Borrow it from the library first, because you don't have to spend money on it that way. Then, if you like the book, buy it if you choose. Some folks who have spoken to me about the book after reading it found it wasn't what they had expected."
1,A sucker is born every minute,Google his name before you buy the book. Be sure you read the information on the FTC website.
1,Doesn't deliver the goods.,"In order to get the solutions the author claims the book provides, you need to invest more money. I can't recommend this book."
1,Natural,"This book gives you just enough information to get you to the ""JOIN US FOR A MONTHLY PRICE OR PAY FOR A LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP"" site called ""NATURALCURES.COM"" to get the crucial information that is lacking in the book itself. If you like to be frustrated by someone who knows something and won't tell you unless you pay them, BUY THIS BOOK."
1,What Cures???,"When I saw the infomercial for Kevin Trudeau's book I was intrigued. I researched him via his website and decided that he had the best interest of his readers at heart.I ordered this book eagerly anticipating the cures he alluded to. My primary interest was in stopping smoking. In his infomercial, he mentioned having found the key to success in this area after being a smoker for 20 years. The book arrived!I searched for the section regarding smoking and low and behold....it sent the reader to his website where obtaining a private membership would be required to access his cure. Silly me, I thought shelling out the money for the cost of the book plus shipping and handling were the keys to his kingdom of cures. Instead what you will find is an awful lot of references to some other person, web site or book.So please save your money. You're better off buying an herbal remedies book then spending a dime on this crap."
1,Toxic Waste,"Kevin Trudeau writes about the negative effects of toxins. Here a toxin, there a toxin, everywhere a toxin... blah, blah, blah. Unfortunatley, he doesn't let you know that his book should be included. Trudeau rants and raves about the FDA and pharmaceutical companies ripping off America, as he rips off the reader. Speaking of rip offs... the website is another ploy to get more money from the consumer. Chapter 3's title, ""It's All About the Money"" says it best. Trudeau has issues with the FDA and pharmaceutical companies; we get it. Either change the title, change the infomercial, or come clean with the promised cures. This book was another lesson in frustration."
2,Too Much Unnecessary Info,"The book was just okay. I bought this book to find NATURAL CURES and he spent the first five chapters talking about government, repeating himself over and over again, and telling me things that I already knew and were common sense. However, in the sixth chapter he comes through a little bit and gives a long list of things you can do to improve your health. It was informative but I was expecting him to give me names of different teas and herbs to take that will eliminate certain illnesses. That did not happen.Now if you know nothing about nothing and just got on the Earth today around 7 a.m., then all 15 chapters will be very important to you. But if you've been here for a while, then the most important chapter to read is chapter 6 and that's all you need."
5,I like this book,"I have read this book. I also subscribed to the [...] monthly newsletter.If this book gets people to eat and think about their lifestyle it is worth every penny. There are a lot of great references to other books that expound further into healthier living. I have incorporated many of the cleanses that are recommended, WOW!I am a great advocate of a healthier lifestyle as the common American diet is literally killing people everyday.I have changed my diet and so has my wife and we all feel incredibleI hope that you'll find ""Natural Cures"" as good of a read as I did."
1,Tolerance Kills You!,"We live in a polluted world especially the air. We have smokers passing you on the streets, we have cars with non-working smog systems (defeated), we have sewage systems that exhaust out of the pavements we walk on, we have small businesses that hustles for dollars and ignore the air standards, we have traffic jams with smokers in them as well, we have neighbors who burns firewood on a daily basis because they thought it saves them money on heating bills, the list goes on. I would not buy any book on wellness until we wipe all of the above first and see what happens next. Yes, I get sick from the dirty air, especially. I asked my neigbor to stop using firewood, but he refused with a middle finger sticking out. America is so set up to be sick and keep the hospitals humming full blast out. Y'all are so tolerant of all that while reading books of wellness in hope of getting better! You are really amazing!"
1,Completely MISLEADING advertising!!,The infomercial on t.v. and his description of this book is a farse. NO CURES LISTED. The book tells you to go to other websites to then pay more for membership fees to learn what he won't tell you in his book. The book title should be CURES I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT IN THIS BOOK!! A waste of $30. Now I have learned the hard way to read the reviews FIRST! This book is a rip off. It should be rated A MINUS.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I saw Kevin's infomercial on TV and was very excited about getting the book. But since I didn't want to spend $30.00 blindly, I waited for the book to get to the library and went on the waiting list to get it. When I got the book and read it,I was glad I didn't spend a cent on it. The book is just an infomercial for a website he has, so you will spend more money. In the infomercial he says he'll tell you the cures for many diseases in the book, and when you read the book he tells you he can't tell you anything because of the FTC, so please go and subscribe to his website. That's crazy! Please don't buy this book and if you're curious about it, just go to your library and check it out."
1,Natural Cures,No cures are listed!!! Promotes website to get list of cures. You have to PAY $$ to get to web pages that May Or May Not have answers. I thought the Book a RIP OFF!!!!!
1,Natural Cure Ripoff,"Kevin Trudeau is a scam artist. I am so disgusted with the book Natural Cures. Repetitive, redundent, riding on the coatails of others research and THEN to top it off referring the reader to his website where he wants to yank our chain for more money! He should be horsewhipped, tarred, feathered, and ran out of town. I am so mad. I have never before returned a book, but this one is going back. To have been limited in ""star rating"" and denied minus zero as a score was a frustration. I have a son with Autism Spectrum Disorder and additonal health issues. For several years I have utilized special diet intervention, vitamin and mineral supplements so I have done a considerable amount of reading into health issues and homopathic treatment. Trudeau takes advantage of those of us looking for alternatives to medication. He should be ashamed."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"You are roped into buying this book, that so many consumers are hoping for cures that really exists...and the only way to really find out out if they exist is by subscribing to his website for MORE MONEY.Quote from pg. 147 ""If you want to get rich, write a book on how to lose weight""...pg 147 ""It goes back to 'It's all about the money.'"" If this is the case, isn't he they same way?THIS BOOK IS A SCAM...I AM SENDING IT BACK!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!! Amazon.com should remove this book from their site!!!!!"
1,Not what you expect,"This book is not at all what you would expect to read. I expected to find lists of cures inside this book, and there are none. He claims that the FTC will not let him publish that, and that you must BUY a membership at his website to know the cures. Why did I pay $29.95 to hear his theories? In terms of theories and reasons, its a great book. But I think most are looking for the cures, not reasons why our government sucks."
1,No Cures is a better title,"He, Trudeau, has been arrested and jailed for credit card fraud. The book just complains and as others have noted, there is NOTHING in the book about ""Cures"". He wants you to visit his website and give HIM your credit card # to get his advice.Read my 1st sentence! I have read blogs where people foolish enough to do so found there is NOTHING, zero contect on his website. Do Not Waste Your Time and Money Making this Con Artist richer than he is. There are other legitimate books on this topic you can buy."
1,No Cures Listed,"All this book does is references to 100 books that are on the market that have natural remedies, without even narrowing down to one particular book for the remedy you're looking for. Just go to the bookstore and research yourself, don't pay him $30.00."
1,Unfortunately disappionting,"This is new: info-mercials in book form.I purchased the book with hopes to find ""natural cures"" inside. Not even close.That will teach me to buy a book without looking up its Reviews on Amazon first.Quick Summery of the book: It's all about the Money."
1,Don't Support this Scam,This has got to be one of the best thought-out money-making scams I've seen in a while. All of the other reviews are accurate. This guy is a scam genius.
5,Create a get dialogue with the book,"We actually decided to read this for our book club. I don't think we had any idea the reactions that would happen. You see a couple of the ladies are in the medical field, do I need to say more. I was on the side of Mr. Trudeau and were most of us.I can say the medical ladies were not prepared for our questions to them and it seems they are used to just following directions of who says what is good and what you are suppose to take. This book started a dialogue that will be going on for some time as I can see. So if you want to get down to it...have your book club read this book."
5,Why Are We Sick?,"""Natural Cures"" is one of the most interesting and disturbing books that I have read in a long time.The chapter on ""Why We Are Sick"" really caught my attention. Not only do I find myself suffering from some illness everyday, it seems that everyone around me is going through the same thing. Are we a sick planet or what?The whole discussion on toxins really makes sense.I am pleased to say that even though I haven't started any of the recommendations, I have started to outline a personal game-plan to do so and I am very pleased and excited to start. I look forward to feeling better."
5,Helpful,"I was urged by my best friend to read this and I am so very happy I did. All these years I have been under the impression I have been eating healthy, I know I eat better than many people. And with the years coming on I thought slowing down and a lack of vitality was a part of aging. I have managed to do some of the simple things like drinking more water and not from the tap, walking everyday, buying organic food.These are not earth shattering new ideas but this book helped me get a better perspective on why I need to do them and I do have more vitality now. My best friend feels better to."
5,I can still have chocolate,I was worried that I would not be able to have any sweets at all anymore. But Kevin says OK to chocolate-as long as it is organic and dark. Chocolate was always my favorite so now that I get to keep that treat all the other new things I am implementing since reading this book do not seem so hard to do. Change can be difficult but in this case it is well worth it. Thanks Kevin for that extra push towards a healthy lifestyle.
2,not worth the money,"If you have seen the infomercial for this book you already know what is in it. Some interesting nutritional information, and a scathing review of the FDA. Mostly it is a rant against the government. The FTC and the FDA are the agencies in the bullseye. These agencies may be deserving of the criticism, but the book never gets beyond that. The evidence is repeated over and over. A pamphlet or magazine article would have covered all the information adequately. Don't waste your money."
2,"Old Information, Re-Marketed for the Not-So-Hip Consumer","Fortunately, I borrowed the book from some other ""Sucker"" who actually forked out the money for Mr. Trudeau's well marketed, heavily misadvertised book...There are plenty others out there with the same message... and they aren't as greedy as Kevin Trudeau.1.http://www.makersdiet.com/2.http://www.healthmasters.com/3.http://www.drcolbert.com/Check out these websites and go read their books free at the Library or your Favorite 'Chain' Bookstore, before buying anything!Why 2 Stars?Great Poker face for Mr. Trudeauand the small amount of useful information the consumer reads from this book is as I referred to earlier...""Old Information"""
1,save your money,Mr. Trudeau goes on and on about how the drug companies are greedy and how they revolve around money. I just wonder how he describes himself? This book is a MINUS 5 stars!
1,Glad I borrowed it from the libarary instead of paying good $,"I rented this book from the library because I didn't want to spend $30 on it. Thank goodness. This book is a scam. Please do not spend your hard earned money for it. Mr. Trudeau's ""chapter 6"" gives you all of his natural cures to make you disease free; however, 50% of the 'cures' are common sense things that most people already know about and 50% of the 'cures' are complete quackery. Seriously, if you are interested in this book, borrow it from your library or a friend to was suckered into paying for it."
5,Kevin Trudeau is God!,"I used to weigh 275 pounds, have a clogged artery, and melanoma. Now I'm a trim 180, jog 10 miles a day, am cancer free, AND have a photographic memory! Thank You Kevin!!"
1,Much Ado about Nothing (in this book),"As another reviewer said -- Kevin Trudeau is a great promoter. I saw the infomercial on television one (early, early) morning and bought the book as a spur-of-the-moment decision. I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews provided by other gullible souls. This book is a rip-off -- very little new information when he DOES give you information. Which is rarely. The reader is repeatedly directed to his website where you have to pay (...)/month for a subscription that promises more detail. Needless to say, I did not sign up. Fool me once. shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. Mr. Trudeau spends 2/3 of the book trashing the food producers and medical profession for their lack of truthful reporting of side effects of additives and pharmaceuticals. However, this book is a perfect example of a broken promise. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"He's a marketing wizard, I'll grant you that","There is absolutely no way anyone could do what he advocates without completely disconnecting themselves and their families from the grid.Some of his ideas are okay - whole foods, avoiding drugs unless absolutely necessary (something I myself believe in and I'm a pharmacist), etc. but they aren't going to save the world.I found his chapter on dangerous drugs interesting especially because he didn't actually name any of them! I knew what they were but the general public would read that and not know if maybe they were using something they shouldn't.If you wish to read this propaganda screed, get it from the library like I did."
5,Worthy of a best seller,"This book is definitely worthy of being a best seller. I saw Trudeau in an informercial and then decided to buy the book. The book doesn't disappoint. It goes the distance to give you other books to read for further information. To my way of thinking, that gives tremendous credence to everything this author writes about."
1,I should have known better.,"The advertising for this book is very misleading. It's full of Mr. Trudeau's rants about conspiracy with very little to substantiate his allegations. My gut feeling is that they're true, but I don't know that from any information provided in the text. The book is peppered with references to his Web site, where you have to pay to get the specifics on the ""cures"" not detailed in the book. Good thing I brought it used on Amazon instead of paying full price!"
1,Save your money,"This book is a waste of money. I have tried to post two negative reviews but they keep getting removed. If you heard the infomercial you have heard all that he has to say in this book. There just aren't any cures that are promised. There are references to ""natural"" things, but frankly that info is all common knowledge. He does give lot's of advice, but anyone who has looked around under natural healing will know that. This book does not deliver what it promises in the title."
2,Very Disappointed,While there is a smidgen of useful information in this book - I found it to be a rambling rehash of his problems and it seemed like everything pointed to his paysite if you wanted any real information. I do not doubt that he has had problems with the government as he promotes things that are decidely against the corporate agenda but then just write a book about that and leave this to be about natural cures. ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY unfortunately. IMHO.
2,has everything BUT Natural Cures !,"To think this book is a encyclopedia for natural Cures...it is not, not even close. For that it gets 2 stars for deception. But it is a good book on the FDA and the FDC and how the Govt tries to control things and are paid off by Appoving drugs, then a year or so later you see a lawyer commercial saying if you tried this join for a lawsuit. I wonder why dont people sue the Govt and the FDA for approving these drugs?? They are just as guilty as the greedy pharmacudical compaines that creates them.Anyhow, he talk about everything but the natural Cures....seems bogus on that aspect."
3,Makes you think... even if it's redundant,"He has a lot of good points and I do think this is worthwhile to read; however, it does get quite redundant with his rants about the FDA. He doesn't give any natural cures - well, nothing to mention, anyway... he wants you to sign up on his website for a fee... all said, I still think that it was informative and I am glad I read it."
1,Natural Cures,"I did not like this book at all. Too wordy, small print, and filled with no help to me."
1,Don't get this!,If you plan on buying this save your money!! Go to the library and get it! It was the BIGGEST waste of money I ever spent on anything!!
1,just eat less and exercise more,an overpriced and over-analyzed way to say eat less and exercise more. the print is very small. a waste of money.
1,Waste of Money,"This book contains NO health tips, it's all about how everyone else is lying and ripping consumers off, and guess what, that is exactly what he is doing. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, it's trash. He says you can find out about health tips at his web site in the book but you have to pay another $70 to have access. (...)"
2,Not helpful.,"This book doesnt actually ""list"" the ""cures"". He tells you what other books to get in order to find these natural remedies. So, I wish I had just gone to my local library and checked these books out instead. Basically the book contains complaints about drug companies."
1,Where are the promised cures?,"After watching the infomercial several times and then ordering and reading the book, I still don't know what natural cures are available! The promises to give people the information they need to cure themselves aren't in the book. What is the cure for cancer? Not in the book! The cure for arthritis? Not in the book. I feel as if I've been a victim of bait and switch. I doubt the newsletter they push has any helpful information, either.Oh, and the customer service email address never responded. In fact the second request for information came back as undeliverable."
2,Deceptive reviews,This book has a lot of well known cures and a few that most don't know . This books repeats itself and points too many fingers.I think instead of 571 pages it should be maybe 215 pages.
1,a waste ...,"I had ordered this book a couple of years ago ... I already am aware of many natural cures and I'm always looking for mre information ... However, this book talks mostly about the agencies and their lies ... DUH ... And if you want actual info on cures you have to join the website! Come on people ... don't spend your money on this & the sequel ... do a little research... talk to other people ... most of the answers are out there for free (Ex: I learned about taking baking soda to improve the pH level in the body ... I thought it might have a positive effect for me because I have gout (too much uric acid) .. and it did help ... I got this info for free)"
1,Where's the proof for these so-called cures?,"Natural Cures says it has cures. But to be really cure, it should be well established and proven. Where's the documented cases? It's ridicuously to say you have a cure for a disease like cancer and the government is tying to suppress the information. Stop and think: if you or someone you knew was cured of cancer by a natural, easy remedy, you'd be shouting it from the mountains and be joined by a choir of others. The whole world would have known already.The ONLY thing this book will *surely* cure you of is about 20 bucks of your money."
1,Natural Cures - NOT!,"This book is nothing but a big advertisement. There is virtually no information on natural cures, just telling you to log on to his web cite - for $10 per month - to get information that is readily available for FREE.If you spend your money on this book, you will likely want it back after you read it."
1,Trudeau Is on Meth,"Seriously, is this wack of a quack on drugs?Just flipping thought the TV channels and quickly surfing over hsi nightly infomerical that advertises this insane diatribe fills my room with the retched, fetid odor of its bull.I can only imagine how more fetid in quality the book must truly be.Next, he'll be selling a book claiming he's found the solution to world hunger and the impending energy crisis."
4,"Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You To Know About","Interesting read. Good information regarding just what ""they"" think you should eat - but research indicates you should not!! I had heard an interview with the author - which prompted my purchase of this book and to read further into his claims."
1,NO! NO! NO!,"I bought this book for my father, and he told me he didn't find any cures in it. I couldn't believe it so I read it myself, the book is nothing but a reference book for other websites or to go to his website and pay fees to become a member to PROBABLY get a cure!!! I couldn't believe it and of course I was VERY PISSED OFF!!! This book is crap and he is nothing but a scam artist!!! I hope the FDA really does shut him down unless of course they are behind this book!!!If I could I would give this book -5 stars!!!"
5,Doing something about it.,"This book inspired me to do something about it. I admit I used to be a couch potato. My niece gave me this book as a gift. I resented it at first but then after she asked me for the 20th time if I had read it yet, I finally just read the book. At first I thought it was just Kevin attacking the FTC etc... but I soon found plenty to think about and do to change things in my life that needed changing. Obviously my niece could see what I did not want to look at....Well now I am changing not only what I eat but I am getting some exercise too. Thank you Stacie for making me read this book."
2,hard to read,"Ive made it to page 88 or so and am sick of his constantly repeating himself. if youve read the book, folks, you'll know what i mean. I'm sure he makes alot of valid points but its hard to go 4 or 5 pages wihout really having said anything of value. He states most of the book is in his own words and was not edited. I think he should've had it edited. I'm not entirely sure I'll ever make it to the end of the book. Oh well, the guy sounds paranoid of everything anyway and makes suggestions that are unrealistic in this day in age. (unless you want to make a lifes goal of not eating, drinking or ever showering again)."
1,GIGO = GARBAGE IN GARBAGE OUT,"I purchased this book when it first came out. Disappointed extremely from the contents of this book. The information provided was not helpful. The book often referred you to other books, journals and reviews. If you have at least 730 days to read and research the reference material provided by the author, I guess it ok. There is no way I would recommend this book or any other book by Kevin Trudeau.I started to purchase Debt Cures they dont want you to know about. It was then I discovered the author was the same person who wrote: Natural Cures they dont want you to know about. I stopped and realized the person has nothing to say and it is not worth loosing your money.Any book by Kevin Trudeau you purchased at your own risk, I certainly would not purchase another book by this author."
1,If zero was an option I would have rated it that,I got this book thinking that It cannot be as bad as people say. I must admit I am a sucker for infomercials and I have had some good results with them until now. This book is a plug to spend money at his website. Some of his statements are so bluntly wrong or so far off base that I did not even finish reading the book. Want a quick tip? Find your local Health Food store and talk to the employees.
1,You don't have to pay for this...,"I thought it was very exciting that someone was bold enough to write this book. But then we he got all greedy and is trying to make money off people for this valuable info, I was sick.So I found a better, free, place to get info: [...]. It gives better info than even his book."
1,Find your natural cures elsewhere! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!,"This book was given to me by my Pschizophrenic father in an attempt to justify why he stopped taking his medicine. (After many years of heartache, it seemed that he finally had a good combination of medication that afforded him some sort of normalcy. But not anymore.)I agree that drugs are being pushed too often in our society and many people are looking for an ""easy"" fix for everything by simply taking a pill. However, I do believe that there is a place for medicine. If possible we should be looking for natural cures first BUT DON'T LOOK FOR THEM IN THIS BOOK! In this book, Kevin Trudeau seems to be writing an endless infomercial for his website.(Which you have to pay to join) Not to mention he rambles on about the benefits of scientology. I finally chunked the book into the nearest garbage can!"
1,Money grabbing media whore.,"This book is merely an attempt on Mr. Trudeau part to make money by whatever means possible. Sure, he isn't selling porn or pimping out kids, but this book is on that level. Save your money. This book reveals nothing new, just sales rhetoric to drive you to his website."
2,Misleading,"I was really looking forward to this book.It is however more political than medical in nature.It's mostly his infomercial in Book Form.He is a remarkable salesman and a hustler.I totally believe in Natural Health, you can find info out there better than this."
1,A sucker born every minute.,"Glad I saw these reviews first. Will not buy the book based on so many negatives where the book is basically how he recoups the cost of the informercial. The to find out a website offers the cures, but is under construction.Hey, why not disclose what the website address is."
1,Don't bother to buy this book,"For all the time the author spends castigating the ""they"" he refers to, in the end he is no better than them. He continually spouts that ""they"" are all about the money, and in the last third or so of the book he continually spouts that you must join his website (it's not free) for any usable information. Throughout the book the reader is teased with this information and it is never given. This book was a total waste of my money. I didn't want to give it even one star."
1,stinks,"what would you expect from a conartist? No references in the book, 30 useless pages of food labels, not a single cure in the manifesto, gradeschool prose....and I want more money!! see my website!!!! that's right. I hope this guy ends up in Guantanamo Bay--where he is forever banned from making infomercials. Thank you Amazon for providing this forum, so that we may be warned about lowlife scum like Kevin Trudeau. I looked at the reviews, checked it out from the library, and I honestly hope he goes to prison."
4,better,other books like this are repetitive but this author seems to do more research. also he adds a lot of his opinions which you could take or leave
5,Hope for the future,"I am a single mom and I would love to be able to feed my children better food. With that being said, on my budget, it is not always feesable. It's cheaper to go to a fast food place than it is to shop at an organic grocery store. I think that is a trap that most people fall into today because of the economy and trying to make ends meet. It's true that the wealthy are healthier than the general public because they can afford all the good food and supplements that they need to live a healthy life. I am giving Kevin's book five stars because he speaks out on the way it is in America. The more people who do that, the more common it will become to have organic food available and the prices will be lower. Then, when my children have children someday, they will be able to feed them nutritious food instead of something that just fills their belly."
2,"Good ideas, impossible to do",The Author has unrealistic goals for our society today. Most people do not have access to his dietary suggestions.
1,Literary junk food,"No wonder he couldn't find a respectable publisher for this extended rant. Not that he tells you anything, just fumes about drug companies and groceries. The few facts he does give are simply wrong: he says hypothyroidism is caused by fluoride in the water; my grandmother was diagnosed at 30, and she was in her 60s before fluoride came in. He says positively that HIV doesn't cause AIDS; surely the president of some benighted backward African country said the same thing not long ago,many thousands died, and it was an international scandal. He says 75% of Americans are fat; actually it's more like 60%.A giant waste of time & money - except for those who like to yell about drug companies and grocery stores."
2,Natural Cures,"The author makes a few good general suggestions such as increase walking and eliminate fast food to control weight, and is accurate in regards to our nation's obsession with drugs and pills and the attempts by big business to profit from this. But he really doesn't provide any natural cures, and none of his claims have any facts behind them. The book is almost 600 pages, but could have been completed in about 75. Most of the book is just repeating the same advise."
5,Deconstructing the Book of Genesis,"Mayers, a Hebrew scholar, explains the multiple meanings of words in the Hebrew scripture. Covering only the first 3 chapters of Genesis, the text is translated almost word for word, and the symbolic and metaphorical narrative is given incredible depth of meaning. The author says his main objective is to tell people what the bible actually says about the origins of our world."
4,"""Are you going to eat that?""","The first time I saw this film was as a teenager with my mother. Kids, learn from my mistake--DO NOT watch this film with your parents. I still have nightmares about the ""Popcorn Scene.""I decided to watch Diner again recently, since I had little recollection of it. Given all of its critical acclaim and somewhat cult-status, I'd say I felt just a little let down. Really, I do mean a little:--the storylines were interesting, but not fascinating;--the ""witty banter"" at the diner was fun, but could have been better (think the coffee shop scene in Reservoir Dogs or the foot rub conversation in Pulp Fiction--now THAT's funny).I think part of the reason for all of the accolades is that the film's ""free-form"" style was somewhat groundbreaking in 1982. It has been done better several times since then. Overall, I'd say this is a solid, entertaining film. Great? Nah."
5,A GIRL'S EYE-VIEW OF DINER,"Couldn't help but note that all these fine reviews appear to be written by males. Lest anyone get the impression Diner is strictly a ""guy"" film, I'm here to enlarge the audience base. It's a no-plot hilarious film with enough bitter/poignant moments to lift it beyond comedy. The acting is superb. I can't say enough about Barry Levinson's firm grasp on the entire picture. The actors, though now well known, were neophytes at the time. Levinson took them beyond themselves. Some of them have never approached the perfection again of their performanances in this film. I think particularly of Steve Guttenberg and Mickey Rourke. I became an instant Kevin Bacon fan first for crass reasons (be still my beating heart) and secondly for his excellent realization of his role. They are bored, they are restless and no, they are not ""men."" They are between adolescence and adulthood, a very unpleasant place to be. We laugh, but they didn't--not then."
3,Music/cars were really cool,"I was part of this period, liked the nostalgia of the movie however it just dragged on and on. Some good parts.....mostly boring."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Another one of those movies that coasts on nostalgia and the (supposed) likability of its cast, Diner is not a terribly good movie--it moves quickly enough and some of the characters' storylines are fun, but it's far from the classic that many people think it is."
3,ok but not great,"People call it a classic i would only say that becuase of the cast. it has a young daniel stern and steve guttenberg, but they could have been better. they say its one of the funniest movie but i dont see it."
2,Far from excellent,"This is one of the top 100 comedies, according to the American Film Institute, but I hardly laughed at all. I enjoy many comedies, but this one had few funny moments. Plus, I could not stand Mickey Rourke; is he always this annoying? And the rest of the actors are far from great ones. Where did the idea of calling this a classic come from?The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the film itself was made fairly well. It did have a 1950's atmosphere, but other than that, I was highly disappointed."
1,A Total Drag,"I've heard a lot a good things about this movie, but I would have to disagree after seeing the movie for myself. Four guys talking in a diner. Wow! How great is that? I usually watch a movie through, but I couldn't with this one. It was boring to the point that I fell asleep. You could disagree. That's alright by me. All I'm saying is, the movie was a bomb."
1,THE most BORING movie EVER!!!,"This is what happens when you buy movies that Amazon recommends; I consider my EXTREME boredom with this movie my PUNISHMENT for letting them recommend a movie for me to buy. Don't let the fantastic cast lure you; this movie is BORING!True, it is realistic in the sense that conversations among friends -- more often than not -- don't necessarily go anywhere, and oftentimes the texture of a movie is -- not in the conversations themselves -- but in the relationships that become evident within those conversations, but nevertheless DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this movie.Did I mention that it was BORING?"
5,Fun,This is such a great collection of now famous stars when they were just young and upcoming. Love it. Thanks. Amazon.
2,Not the greatest movie.,I had to watch it for a college class. The movie itself was good quality but I didn't like the movie.
2,terrible book,"This was a ""suggested"" purchase for a grad class. The text is overly complex, the subject matter extremely difficult to understand. While I was able to use it for my class, it required multiple readings in order to obtain a primitive understanding of the topics. Not presented well and ill suited for a non-mathematics or statistics class. Perhaps mismatched for the course I was taking, but again, a book like this should not be this difficult. I do not recommend it."
2,oof!,"Unless you have a thorough background in statistics and economic theory you will get lost with this book. If a lot of formulas, demand curves, models, and stuff like ""Empirical Implementation of Optimality Rules"" and ""Testing the Equilibrium Location Conditions"" are your thing, go right ahead and dive in. You'd probably give the book 5 stars. If not, get a different book."
1,Has no smell?,"I bought this item from PerfumeOutlet and I'm not happy at all with it. Unlike the previous reviewer, the deodorant stick I received DOES NOT have any smell - not sure if the vendor sold me a lemon knowingly (the tape on the package box was unsealed when I received it) or inadvertently but it's a complete disappointment. I've had two other deodorant stick for Curve for men and Polo Blue and those all had a pretty strong smell. At this point I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it (returning a deodorant feels... weird) but I'd like to warn anyone who's thinking about getting this that it might not be all rosy."
2,Very poor quality,Poor quality for the money.cannot compare to canon for one third price. Nylon bag thin flimsey. Not worth any thing
3,Not For Me,"This product was not for me. Product was poor at creating a good lather and left my hair feeling squeaky clean instead of smooth and clean like I get with other men's shampoo. It is all natural and that is probably why it does not lather as well. Also the scent is Lemon which does not appear in the description of the product section. Though, it does not have much of a scent to it. Also it is safe for clor treated hair. Again, I'm sure this works for others but I will not purchase again."
5,Great buy! Mr. Palomar,The book was received on time and in great condition. I am very satisfied with this company's service.
2,"Great description and narrative, but a little bored","Well, Calvino's work in general is great, but this book is a little bit different of all other, is all Narrated and is a complete description of everything, it's about a man that watch everything wondering why everything goes on, and it bores the reader, if you like description well done so read it, if you like dialog don't read it you won't like it"
4,"""Angels Don't Cry"" makes it worth it ...","Unlike *real* albums you can't listen to it cohesively in one listen as it is really a collection of songs from live tracks to remixes and oddities. Most songs are just different versions that would cater to the dnce or remix enthusiasts. But the real gem here is ""Angels Don't Cry"". This version is much better than the Midnight To Midnight version and this song is one of their best tunes, musically speaking. I don't know why this wasn't as well-promoted as a single as the other Furs songs. This is right up there with other Furs classics. Considering the cheap price of this CD, imagine you are buying an Angels Don't Cry single with all these bonus tracks. Then it will be worth it for you ..."
4,an eclectic collection,"I picked up this book after enjoying some of Wilkinson's numerous ""New Yorker"" pieces. This collection is truly eclectic, covering subjects/people as diverse as Asperger's Syndrome, John Wayne Gacey, the Rolling Stones, an NHL goalie and survivors of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge regime. It was a bit difficult to get a concrete sense of Wilkinson's voice, but his breadth of coverage and respect for his topics/themes definitely showed in the essays. I especially liked how elegantly he managed to describe his feelings toward these topics. Worth reading."
5,easy reading with complicated ideas!,"I absolutely love this book.It gave me a wholistic view of women's lives in the Middle East. I love the combination of short fictional stories, autobiographies, and essays. This book is entertaining as well as mind opening."
4,Not to Shabby....,"This cd is pretty good. I enjoy listening to the Heavy Metal from differnt sources. If i had to cross refrence this band to other bands.Id say the music is like Trivum, the screams like Lyzaniia, and their taste in music is very verse eclectically like 30STM. But it all boils down to the solid guitar riffs and good screams with some melody mixed in.. I definately enjoy the music. And i will listen to this cd a few more times."
4,Funny stuff,"This book contains hundreds of jokes and articles that have circulated via email over the past couple of years; however, most of them were new to me. They are organized by topic (e.g., children, men and women, history), and they are pretty entertaining to read. The editor has kept the content ""family friendly,"" so this is a book you could give to your grandmother without worry. All-in-all, this is a fun book."
1,The whine goes on--and on.,"A disappointing example of memoir-writing at its solipsistic worst, Hand to Mouth has no redeeming characteristics. The passage on the ingrown toenail is, quite simply, a howler. Like Barber/Effing's cave paintings, this work should be buried/sink out of sight."
3,It's all about the benjamins.,"As far as I can tell, this is the story of Paul Auster's long, previously unfulfilled quest to prostitute his writing ability for money. Now that he's successful, he's been given the leeway to do precisely that -- with this book.It's pretty thin, pretty boring, and only comprises about a third of the pages in the book. The rest is just lumber thrown in to justify a hardcover and stylish jacket design. That said, I suspect that he saw the opportunity to make a little cash and he took it. No shame in that, as long as he keeps producing good novels.He gets the three stars for not being a hypocrite."
3,"A tease...great start...lousy middle, reasonable end",This book started out great. It was a very interesting story (about 120 pages) about a writer's life. Well written. As the book is about his early failures is it really necessary to take up the other 2/3 of the book with examples of his failures. I don't hold these failures against him: but why should I be subjected to them...
3,the world of litterature and writing,"Like in the great novel hunger, but in a nother modus, the documentary type of fiction we are faced with the suffering of the young writer. This young man is in his ""sturm und drang"" period of life. He is exited by the gift of existence,but also frightend by the freedom it gives, we are following this dedicated man. The confrontation between young insecurety and the struggle to recieve recognition and securety for his choice of life is sentral to the novels plot."
2,Stylish but expensive. Shows damage from normal play right away,"These shoes got a lot of compliments in the style department, but the first time my daughter wore them to the playground, the pink surfacing on the toe uppers scraped off and revealed leather underneath. She only got to wear them once before they looked damaged. The camo upper got dirty quickly. I ran the shoes through the wash cycle on hot several times, and the camo upper still looks discolored from dirt.The shoes are too long for my daughter's feet, but they're vertically too tight in the toes, especially when she wears thicker or ribbed socks. The shoes are not a good value -- Old Navy's shoes look as good, cost 1/5th the price of these shoes, and don't fall apart on active kids."
2,"Poor Quality, Needed Repair Out of Box, Works well now","Bought item and it didn't work. Luckily, I'm handy with a DVM and soldering Iron. Cause was bad solder joint inside. Works great now. Parts seem of reasonable quality. Assuming most parts aren't defective it is well worth the price"
1,Aweful Taste,"I bought a box of these to try, MISTAKE. It took all I had to choke them down until I could switch back to the soy protein bars."
1,ripped off,this book was purchased at half off by the seller and i tried getting in touch with the person because the school information was misleading and i ordered the wrong book and wanted to send it back and they never responded to my email. NEVER AGAIN
5,Excellent book - a must read.,"John Little and Peter Sisco wrote static contraction... but John takes it a step further and eliminates the need for doing reps with scientific explanations to back up his revolutionary concept of weight training/ muscle building.. My girlfriend and I started doing this method in may of 2005 and I can honestly say i've never found such a fast, quick and easy way to build muscle. This is also a great method for those not wanting to spend hours in a gym... after a while, you only need to workout once a week... but don't forget to stretch afterwards... and don't forget to do cardio on other days.I've never been able to develop the 6pack abs until I used the techniques in this book... not to mention all the other muscles popping out that I never knew were there before! I don't entirely agree with his take on supplements - although I think he's referring to all the stupid gimmicks out there designed to waste your time and money. Apparently he's not familiar with Shaklee."
2,Nice TV show and bad transfer,"MANDRAKE is a TV show produced by HBO in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, based on character created by Rubem Fonseca. 13 episodes were produced. The show has violence, nudity, drugs.This DVD set, released by Maya ent. is a big disappointment. The video quality is really awful and looks like a unprofessional rip from a VHS or a 240p video at youtube. The original aspect ratio is widescreen, but the video is letterboxed, which means the image has black bars above and below it, just to fit a fullscreen TV. If you have a Widescreen TV, the image will suffer some distortion due to the stretching.Concerning the audio and subtitles, the DVD offers the following options:- Audio 5.1 portuguese and 2.0 spanish.- Subtitles in spanish and english.The show deserves 4 stars, however the video quality is just 1 star - considering the bad transfer and the unprofessional authoring.There are no featurettes."
5,Whatevers Goin Down...!,"I'm on the case. I bought this anthology about 3 years ago and I still am amazed at how underrated the Isleys upbeat funk is. They are much heavier than the Commodores or the Gap Band and Ron Isley has one of the most distinctive voices in black music history, but it is the ensemble palying that makes this joint the sho shot. Check out the guitars on Climbin up the Ladder, or the lewd and nasty bass and keys on Liquid Love. Everyone always talks about their slow jams and they are spectacular but the fact that this is a basically a rock band probably started to turn many radio DJs away from them towards the end of the 70s. Rediscover one of America's best bands."
3,Not a bad effort by Zubro,"[....] If you've read other books in this series, you'll like this one. If this is your first outing with Detective Paul Turner and his police partner Buck; you should head back to the first in the series. This book stands up fairly well on its own, but it's much better if you've followed the characters. Their development is a bit more apparent if you see where they've come from. The scenes of Turner's home life with his lover Ben and two sons seems a bit out of focus; as though Mr. Zubro has no reference point for a gay man's life at home. Why only 3 stars? Because too much was wrapped up in the final few pages without a great deal of set-up or follow-through. None of the clues along the way would lead you to any of the solution. It seemed rushed and forced.MHS"
3,Passable but Boring,"Basically, the story telling itself is good. The story line, however, is dull and pedestrian. There is really no action, not much suspense, some laughable intrigue and banal banter between the characters. I thought the story got completely goofy about halfway through. As long as you're not expecting too much this is makes for an ""OK"" read, but it isn't challenging by any means.Keep in mind that this is one of Mr. Zubro's earlier works and fortunately, his plot development has grown immensely since this snooze-fest was written, so from the ""watching an author develop professionally over time point-of-view"" it can be interesting. Read Mr. Zubro's later books; they're infinitely better."
5,Another great Zubro Mystery,Great Mystery....Mark Zubro has done it again! Paul Ben his 2 children Mrs. Talucci even his partner all came to life again in another ongoing Turner mystery...thank-you Mr. Zubro for continuing this series
1,Terrifying. I wish 0 stars was an option!,"This book may indeed make a good reference for one who regularly deals with the subject matter. However for the uninitiated (me) this book was a truly awful experience. It was used as a textbook my Probability/Queuing Theory class. It is almost completely useless for this purpose. Its language would be clear only to someone holding an advanced degree in mathematics, never to an undergrad. Our instructor had 20 (and growing) handwritten pages of errata.If your instructor requires this book, you should waste no time in writing nasty letters to his superiors. You are in for a real trial.Avoid this book at costs."
4,hot/cold,"This is a brilliantly written book; a nail biting, page-turner. I'll never forget it, but my very last thought, at the very end was: well THAT was depressing!"
5,Readers of The Unfortunates are the fortunate ones !,"I so enjoyed this fantastic novel! The writer takes you on a roller coaster ride that makes many exciting twists and turns. The plot includes a realistic array of characters with dimension. The excellent character development provides a multitude of reasons to become invested in the outcome of the characters and there are plenty of dastardly evil elements you'll love to hate. The camaraderie between Christian McCorkle and his mystery solving co-workers adds immensely to the enjoyment of the book. I highly recommend The Unfortunates by C.A. Smythe to anyone who likes the notion of a murder mystery with humor, heart and intrigue, mixed with supernatural elements that allow for the truly unexpected !"
5,Hilarious and witty! I LOVED IT!,"This book has such a unique sense of humor, I couldn't put it down! I've read it multiple times and am still discovering things I didn't catch before. I highly recommend it for those who are ready for something a little out of the ordinary. You won't regret it!"
1,Weak Game Mechanics,"I picked this up because it was on sale and the box intriged me. When I finally played it, though, it sucked the energy out of the room in three minutes flat. The questions are passable, but it's just not very fun to try and guess some of the answers. The game definitely drags. Another thing I found useless is the play mechanics. You're supposed to write an answer to the given question and then pick another player to beat, but using Paper Rock Scissors. The connection between those two parts of a typical round is arbitrary. There are too many other great games out there to give this experimental board game anything above one star. Pass it up."
3,A Good Introduction to the CAPM Certification,"The Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) Role Delineation Study is essentially a high-level introduction to the CAPM certification examination. It describes how the certification type evolved, and provides some general insight and guidance into the six domain areas covered by the exam. While going into further detail regarding the exam must be considered 'out of scope' for this PMI publication, a useful addition to this document would have been to provide some linkage between the domain tasks described and the Project Management Body of Knowledge.Overall, this publication is a concise description of the intended audience for the certification, and does provide some helpful and useful guidance toward preparing for the exam itself, though it remains up to the certification candidate to fill in the details."
2,Not as good as some,"I have read several of Barbara Woods books lately. I think she's a good writer, but this book was not one of my favorites. It went on and on before it reached the end of the book. Maybe Egypt is not my ""thing"" to read about."
2,Predictible and boring,I had always enjoyed reading B.Wood... until now. I could not follow the history because never was interesting for me. I found the same history in others novels about Egypt. I don't recomend it
4,"Iowa, Beijing (One Company, One Civilization): A.K.A. Childr","I would characterize Pearl Buck's work as pre-communist China, Anchee Min's the Cultural Revolution, Jung Chang's the modern tragic generations. I enjoy them all tremendously as they each tells so well the Chinese story in their own era. I had a hard time, however, finding a work that tells the story of the dynamic, capitalistic, current China, that is, until I came across Iowa, Beijing. A meaningful book that tells the tale of corporate China and much more."
5,5 Stars,"My company recently switched to Domino and I needed to learn how to develop in this environment quickly, and I had absolutely zero Domino experience. A friend lent this book to me saying that although it is a bit old it is still the best resource his employees have used for learning Domino development, and he bought it based on his IBM sales rep's endorsement.The book brought me from nothing to being able to comfortably develop forms and views in only a few days. The author is witty (his name is Jon Stuart after all, maybe the same one from Comedy Central), easy to understand, does not make offensive assumptions, and is a Domino maven.I am presently searching ... trying to get more copies for some other developers at my company, but I am having an impossible time. Any help would be appreciated."
3,A good but very general introduction to Domino,"This is a good book for those not very technical and/or those who want a gentle intro to Lotus Domino. But for those wanting a comprehensive course, this is not the book for you. Not very many examples are given, and I would say about half of the 360 or so pages are wasted with unnecessary screen captures and extruciatingly detailed instructions on how to, for example, create a form, but with no details about what to put in that form, just on how to create the form itself. These instructions are repeated verbatim every time the author involves a similar step in some other description, instead of just saying ""refer to page ..."" though he does do this once or twice."
3,A very good drama abot the histoy of great britain and Irel.,"ko'jkopm,jojm+++löl,+ii9u0mioßjiojijijhh"
1,What?! This isn't rock!,There are hard guitars but that suddenly stops and then whiney- oh the world is so hard- crap. This one should go under radars. There are so many bands out there already like this. It is like half the band wanted to be metal and the other half emo. Altogether a very bad mix.
1,Unorigional,"The music isn't that great and they copied the style of many other bands, they couldn't even come up with origional song titles... there all other bands top songs... this cd isn't worth it... burn some songs if anything dont buy it"
1,This band is really this bad,"I bought the CD since I was going to see Crossfade open up for Alter Bridge and I liked Cold the first couple of times I heard it. Then I listened to the rest of the CD. Words can't explain how bad it is. Cheesy rap-rock with over-used power chords is probably the best description. The songs all sound the same. The lyrics border on ridiculous. And to boot, they are even worst in concert. Most of the people sat and watched them act like kids on stage while a group of 5 high school kids banged their heads to the music. They have a dj who messes around with turn tables and tries to rap, with the keyword tries. He is the most pathetic want-a-be that I have ever seen. After 2 listens, I gave the cd to my little sister who loves Cold. This is a terrible band and a terrible release."
1,THIS CD SUCKS BIG TIME,"What a joke! there are only 2 decent songs on here cold and Dead Skin. This band has a new single on the radio now and it actually sounds pretty good. Hopefully their new album will be better too. If you like the new song ""Invinsible"" That is from the upcoming album titled ""Falling Away"". Hopefully the band went into a studio this time to record their new album. So if you are thinking aout giving crossfade a listen I wiuld wait fir the new album. My point is THIS CD SUCKS AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED."
1,"WOW, Music has really gone downhill.","My roomate made me listen to this cd. It made me so angry I had to write a review. This cd is beyond bad. I would rather listen to hungry dogs barking than stuff like this. I grew up listening to grunge. This is an embarassment. Hopefully they will soon go away. If I could give it less than one star I would. My suggestion: if you are thinking of purchasing this cd, spend the $12 on a worthwhile charity, buy a homeless person some food and download this drool if you must have it."
4,Good stuff,"First off, let me say I bought this CD just because of Cold hoping the rest of the CD would be somewhat comparable. Upon first listen, I was sorely disappointed. However, after listening a few more times, I really have come to enjoy this CD and had a difficult time actually taking it out of my CD player.Colors, which has a solid progression(as well as message), is my favorite song next to Cold. Death Trend Setta(#5) and Deep End(#6) are my next favorites, although Death Trend Setta does steal a guitar riff from Rage Against the Machine's Killing In the Name Of. So Far Away's good, but I like tracks 4-9 better than it or Starless(weak opening to the song). Overall, a good CD for anyone who digs Velvet Revolver, Seether, or the like...although it should have more than 10 tracks."
2,predictable,"This is one of those ok borderline albums, well ok in parts. I got this album after listening to bits of some of the better songs, but that is all that can be said really its ok in parts! The vocalist is really awkward to listen to, i mean, trying to rap with a voice like that is stupid, and most of these songs are too similar. Last but not least this album is so over produced its unreal its too damn crisp and clean which i personally think is never a good thing! All in all you wouldnt be missing anything here by not buying it, so far away is worth a listen though."
3,A little bit competitive with Breaking Benjamin,A bit of a jump-off. Their first single 'Cold' is huge down south bringing up north kind of thing. Not recommended highly if you're into either Korn or Breaking Benjamin. This sounds quite eeriely similar. For curious seekers only :-0
4,I got hooked by it too...,"The first time i heard the song 'Cold' was when i just woke up and turned the TV to Vh1.i got hooked by the song the very first time.a couple days later i kinda forgot about the song until i saw it again this time on MTV.so i figured if this song is good then ill try the cd.when i got the cd,i liatened to it for a while but i couldnt listen to it because the last couple of songs were just not the same kinda style as the earlier songs.later that night i listened to the whole album and i figured it wasnt too bad.of course i like the songs cold and colors,but i also like starless,deep end and death trend setta.this was crossfade's debut album.the lyrics are diverse and the production is a little off but i like this band and their album so i recommend this album."
3,3.5 stars,"Crossfade kinda sounds like a cross between Hoobastank and a (male voiced) Evanescence. For ten bucks you can pick it up at Target, and it's worth it.Starless - a good opener but sounds strange at times.Cold - instant classicSo Far Away - one of the better songs.Colors - alright. Again, one of the better songs.Death Trend Setta - would have been tolerable without the weird sounding background.The Deep End - easy to listen to.No Giving Up - second best song on this album.Dead Skin - average.Disco - throwaway track.The Unknown - kinda boring but not bad."
4,A real mixed bag,"Anyone who's heard the single's COLD and SO FAR AWAY knows just how much potential this band has. However, for their first major-label debut, Crossfade doesn't quite deliver the breathtaking experience I was expecting. Some of the non-singles are just as good, if not better than, COLD. But some could be better. The Unknown is too short, while Death Trend Setta could have been better w/o the rap verse.Starless 4/5Cold 5/5So far away 5/5Colors 4/5Death Trend Setta 3/5The Deep End 4/5No Giving Up 5/5Dead Skin 3/5Disco 2.5/5The Unknown 3/5Overall, it's worth it for the handful of great songs. Just don't pay more than 10 bucks. For fans of: Nickelback, Breaking Benjamin and Three Doors Down."
2,All the same,This CD is so repetetive. All the songs are almost the same. The same beat over and over. The songs are quite good but too much the same.You pay for one song. It sounds like any other groups that we have already heard.
4,4.5 stars! great album!,"I personally love this cd! especially the song colors, that was the reason i bought the album, but i put the cd in and i really like all the other songs too. My only complaint is that the cd is really short, its only 10 songs! i think it should've been longer its not even an hour long, but it is a great album and well worth the money it costs. go out and buy it!"
2,This CD F@%&ing SUX!!!,"This CD has only 10 tacks, which is already a minus since most of the other CDs out there have at least 11. The songs do sound extremely unoriginal. I'm not gonna review all songs one by one because there is nothing really to review. ""Cold"" is alright, and ""Starless"" isn't too bad. The rest of the CD is total crap!!! Plus, the CD is censored... and there is no notice on the cover, WTF???"
1,These guys suck ass!,"you people who rate this crap with four or five stars must not listen to much music. These guys sound just like every other band out there. They are definitely not worth the money at all. What they pretty much did is copy other bands, mix it together and call it good. What they forgot was to make it interesting and original. My hell, what is music coming to?Recommended: Breaking Benjamin (these guys are actually good and original!)"
2,big and dumb,"Crossfade's major label debut showcases it seems strictly big chunky guitars and well timee drum signature. there general sound is solid enough and satisfying for its wall-of-sound shtick. But the album wallows in fomrulaic song craft and some of the most poorly written lyrics ive heard in a long time...wait till you hear this moron rap (""disco"").if they had a more compelling singer and much needed change from aut pilot one might notice a decent unit here. As it is Crossfades album is simply to big and dumb to be taken seriously."
3,"Notting Special, Im a huge Nu Metal/Alturnive Fan",I was looking forward to this cd after hearing cold(my fav. song ever!listen to it all the time) But it was a let down it sounds to look so many other bands in its group.
5,Great cd...for a re-release...,"This cd was ACTUALLY created 3 or 4 years ago. Crossfade used to be a different band and had to change their name when they signed to a record deal. Columbia decided to bring them into the studio and have them do all the tracks on their self-produced cd. So in actuality these songs were all done when some of the bands mentioned in the previous reviews were just blowing up...so give it some slack. The songs are well written and I love every song on the cd. They left some good songs off the re-release, but hey...maybe we'll see them next cd. Crossfade is an energetic and hard working band and deserve EVERY penny they get. Don't think these guys sit around. They tour and play as much as they can and I'm sure the year and a half it took to get signed and throw out a cd for us was stressful. AMAZING cd."
3,"Average, Great Job !!!","Crossfade is one of those bands like Breaking Benjamin who have lot's of potential!!! This was a pretty good Cd with songs like Starless, Cold, and Colors the rest is average to below average!!In my opinion they are a little over-rated and commericalized because of one good song!!! I suggest other bands like Breaking Benjamin, Seven Wiser, Starta, Submersed, and Velvet Revolver.Starless: 4/5Cold: 5/5So Far Away: 2/5Colors: 4.5/5Death Trend Setta: 3/5The Deep End: 2/5No Giving Up: 3.5/5Dead Skin: 2/5Disco: 1/5The Unknown: 1.5/5Avg: 2.85Est: 3/5The band has to work on chesmitry in song writing and basicly everything!!! I have faith that Crossfade could do better,hopefully!!!"
5,Great Record,When I first heard Cold on the radio I was stunned. I had been given this song as as unreleased demo four years earlier when I was managing some bands that were signed to major labels. I remember listening to the demo and thinking how damn good it was. It is great to see a true rock band finally get some recognition.
3,Ok,"I bought this album because of ""Cold"" which in my opinion is a great song. I was a bit dissapointed. Cold is one of the three good tracks on the half an hour long CD. It is very short with most songs under three minites and most of the time the vocals doesn't go good with the music (Listin to ""Starless"" and you'll see what I mean)and there are tracks which seem better suited to a rap album such as ""Death Trend Setta"". The actual band is good but since it was put together in a amature recording studio it lacks quality at times.My advice: know the band inside and out before you buy this CD."
4,good for them,"i have followed crossfade since 2001 when they were sugardaddy superstar up in columbia,sc and i'm glad they made it.""starless"" is absolutely off the chain and ""cold"" is awesome as well.definitely a great modern rock album and i hope they go far."
4,Cool,"Heard the band on the UMD demo disc that came with my PSP, with a free Crossfade music video. Very cool. So I went to http://www.bandmerch.com/java2/BandMerch/Crossfade/ and bought the autographed DualDisc (CD/DVD) and a cool t-shirt. I like to support indies, but gets 4 star here because the album is very short."
4,Man you is be crazy...,"This album has a few ""iffy"" songs but for the most part it has a unique sound and I found it to be quite enjoyable. Anyone who has a negative view on this cd need realize, THEY MADE IT IN THEIR BASEMENT give em a break. Oh and realize you suck and have no ear for decent hard rock."
4,YO,"I actually havnt bought this cd yet. I know this ain't a forum or anything, but is this cd really censored no matter what version you get. That is some messed up stuff. I'm with my dogg down there, forgot ur name, I can't look past censorship. Holler."
1,"The War is Over, Music Lost","Crossfade is to Rock and Roll what Hallmark is to World Literature. Even though they may ""totally kick a$$"" in your pubescent mind, they are still just regurgitated garbage.Once upon a time, before corporate rock, rock musicians actually broke new ground with their music and sang about things other than their dopey high school romance or how much they hated their parents.Lyrics - FStrictly Three Chord Guitar Work- AVerse Chorus Verse Chorus Refrain Chorus sound like every other band of the last five yearsitude - A"
1,these guys are a joke,"this cd is just like everything else on the radio right now. nothing special, just boring vocals and guitars with no substance. its crap like this that makes rock music a joke now, if you want something good go get the new machine head cd, ""through the ashes"" or the new killswitch Engage cd."
4,Good Band -lyrics suck,"This band is a typical band -All bands lyrics suck. I think that ""Cold"" and ""So Far Away"" are there best songs, But I think Heavy Metal songs should scream more and this band is Really mellow expect for""So farAway"
4,really good,"one of the most underrated albums in my collection (the only problem is, is that i got the one that bleeps out the curse words) other than that, i recommend buying it"
5,Crossfade CD,I bought this item for a gift. It was a good price and kept me from having to hunt it down during the Christmas rush. My daughter loves the CD.
3,A few stand-out songs save mediocre debut.,"Of course, everyone has heard the big hit ""Cold."" That song carries this album along with the other hit, ""Colors"". There are a couple other songs worth your time, but those are found early on, and it gets somewhat weak towards the end. You'd be better off downloading the good songs, but to each his own."
2,not completely bad imitators,"I have listened to crossfade's songs and I can't help but hear alot of nickelback and puddle of mudd in their songs. Those are not bad bands to follow, except crossfade is trying to sound exactly like them. I wouldnt recommend buying this particular album unless you have not heard any puddle of mudd or nickelback songs, then you might actually enjoy it."
2,Lax,"Crossfade is just another attempt at post-grunge music. However, they aren't as terrible as Creed, but they are pretty lax. ""Cold"" is a mediocre song, and the rest aren't that great either.I'm writing this as a hardcore/metal/punk listener who hates corporate radio and MTV. Crossfade is too mediocre for my standards. Don't buy this, and if you must, get a song off iTunes or Napster."
3,Crossfade,"I just got this album today and I liked the three singles. Not a bad debut, but I have heard a lot better. Since it has been out for awhile, I'm sure you can find this for way under $10 in a bargin bin. So check it out!"
5,I love it!,"My favorite album. i have it first on my MP3 player. i listen to it over, and over, and over agian. tracks 2-5 are my favorite. this is kinda' hard, load, rock n' roll music with a punk attitude. seriously, i would give this 10 stars if i could! i love it!"
2,Where the f*@$ are the rest of the lyrics?,"All around decent CD, along the same vibe of Nickelback, Alter Bridge, Saliva, etc....just one problem, the CD is edited. The copy that i purchased had nothing indicating that it was the edited brethren of a dirtier copy, but when I popped it in I could immediately tell something was wrong. Instead of a solid curse word, I got the ""radio pause"" (you know, where the music keeps going, but the word is blocked out). I'm not some guy that just goes around swearing up a storm, but I think that I should have a choice as to whether or not I want to listen to music that contains swearing. This just really bothered me about the CD. Some people can look past it, I can't. Gimme my curse words dammit!!!!!!"
3,Poor sound spoils one of Goldsmith's greatest scores,"This is a magnificent score, presented here in feeble, tinny and harsh sound. Excerpts from this original soundtrack in excellent sound have been issued in a now-unavailable Goldsmith compilation from Varese Sarabande, so we know that decent source material is available, waiting to be released. Looks like patience will be needed if you want a decent CD of this superb music."
3,Chivalry and Romance,"One of my favorite epic war films is made all the more unforgettable with this stirring score from the prodigious pen of Jerry Goldsmith. What's unfortunate is that being from the original soundtrack (1966), the fidelity is comparatively thin. Also, the music as presented here is often in all-too-brief episodic bursts, possibly to be accommodated in its original LP incarnation, but most likely created as such. Either a thorough remastering or perhaps an integral suite recording by someone the likes of orchestral pops meister Erich Kunzel is in order."
3,"Would have been 4 stars, if sound quality had been better.","Sound is rather tinny, but it's Goldsmith and early Goldsmith at that. A must-buy for Goldsmith afficiandos, of which I'm one; but I wish the master-soundtrack had been preserved better. (At least the soundtrack seems quite complete and in order.)"
4,sick album,"If you are in to southern rap then you will enjoy this cd, has good beats and some sick bass i would definently reccommend this for anyone who wants something different then get this."
5,Gave me Goosebumps,"Fantastic video capturing the Highlights of the World Series. I'm, needless to say, a huge cards fan and absolutly love this video. I just ordered the full 8 disk set and can't wait to see all of the games over again!!!! Go Cards!"
2,8 inch Pyle Ceiling speakers,"Well for the price I paid for I guess I shouldn't expect much. bought 3pairs & install themfor background music at a restaurant. and, I wasn't so happy for what I'm hearing. it sounded distortedand, the wires that they used has no markings for negative or positive. so take a guess!!!"
5,MOST ENJOYABLE I'VE READ SO FAR...,"I didn't start reading until shortly before my 65th birthday. That was sixteen months ago and since then I have read sixty-one (61) books - most of them by the heavyweights (Stephen King, Ken Follett, Dean Koontz, Jonathan Kellerman, James Patterson, John Sanford, Douglas Preston/Lincoln Child, Lisa Scottoline, the Left Behind Series, all of John Grisham's, and more). ""A Trace of Smoke"" is by far the most enjoyable book I've read so far. I can hardly wait for his next one. A couple more like this and this author will knock the big guns right off their perches."
5,I had to make myself leave that book...,I had to make myself leave that book to tend to my chores. I'm a librarian.
3,Word of Caution,"The stretches here are great and the routine one of the best. However, word of warning, to all who like to pop in a video and work through the routine: Dr. Maloof talks before each exercise and explains it. This is great for the first time but after that incredibly annoying. If you do not have a remote control to fast forward during the talks, you might create more stress than you are stretching out!"
1,Jamie's Review,"I was disappointed. I found the video to be very basic. Perhaps more importantly however, the video is extremely frustrating to watch as the instructor speaks very slowly and spends a lot of time explainig the exercises. In the end it is a 55 minute video used to describe a 15 minute routine. while it is the first and only execrcise video I have seen, I am certain that better ones must be available."
1,unsatisfactory,"The flashdrive is quite large, and the downloadable software is not user friendly at all. It has not let me password-protect the flashdrive, and in fact files transferred to the drive seem to disappear. Wasted my money."
4,Great price for that much space!,"The bottom line is that you can't beat the price for 4GB. This is not great for putting on a keychain. But, if you just need it to bring info from Point A to Point B, it's perfect!"
1,"Won't work, no support","I purchased JetFlash V10, 4gb about a month and a half ago. It has simply never worked. Transcend will not honor the ""Lifetime"" warrantee (they actually will not even return my emails or faxes). The Amazon seller will not take the item back, it was just a waste of money. I will never buy a Transcend product again."
5,Just What I Needed,"Exactly the part I needed for my 2.5L Jeep TJ 2002, I work at Pepboys and sell the same exactly product. Got this hose cheaper on here than with my discount at Pepboys lol. OVERALL: Good quality, LOWEST prices, yes even lower than RockAuto."
4,A Dragon's will,"I recently got involved with 4th Edition Shadowrun, so that go me interested in Dunkelzahn. So, I picked up the PDF copy of this. For $10, it's a pretty good deal. The will is interesting, and the information helps flesh out my knowledge of what happened, but you aren't getting answers on what happened, so don't be mad about that.Personally, I think the Big D faked his own death."
2,A Big Disappointment,"This book did not deliver what I wanted at all. The summary of the book stated that it was supposed to give ideas for GM's to write their own adventures. However I would have liked some story seed ideas and maybe a pre-written adventure in the book so I could run my players through it. And stats on the items that Dunkelzhan handed out in his will would have been nice so I would know what my players were up against, and what kinda things they would be able to do with them if they ever got their hands on them.The will was the only good thing in the book and was NOT worth the money I paid for this book.If you are a Shadowrun GM or a player, do yourself a favor and pass this one up since you can download the will from their website for free."
3,:|,"Maura took the job with Spencer Diamond so that she would have a reason to visit the town that he lived. Maura recently discovered that her father lives in the same town, a father that she never knew of until now. Spencer was suprised when Maura called and asked if his offer of a job was still available. When Spencer first asked Maura to see if she could help his horse overcome his fear of starting gates at the race track she said No. Although Spencer was suspicious of her reasons he really needed her help. The more time they spend together the more attracted they are to one another. But, what happens when Maura's secret comes out?I was a bit bored with the story. I felt that it had great potential, but it held little excitement. And like the first book about the Diamond family I was disappointed at the ending. Just when you think that the story has a chance to get exciting, its over. Oh well, maybe the last story in the series will be better."
4,The Definative Guide for HPR,"I've been launching model rockets for 20 years, but had been wanting to make the leap to HPR for some time now. This book helped me make the transition and evaluate what gear I need to modify vs upgrade. Generally, it answers all your questions about HPR and is a great reference for those wanting to make the move from model to M/HPR.This book seems to be the encyclopedia of HPR. Great to keep on hand to answer any of your HPR questions.Tweeks"
3,emmm,"it has some good information but I didn't like it . I prefer ""Model Rocket Design and Construction"" by Apogee Components ."
2,HIGH POWER Rocketry 2,"The book is useful for anyone wanting to get a start in HIGH POWER Rocketry. By that I mean it is for HIGH power beginners only. There are few advanced techniques within this book to make it the ""HIGH POWER BIBLE"" as some have said. The level specific rocket builds read just like a set of instructions. Only good for that specific rocket. No good information about fiberglass reinforcement or laminating. No in depth electronincs pages. Multiple motor reload assembly pages. How many times do we need to see that? A real disapointment. Buy only for beginners"
4,Great for the beginner,"I am an experienced model rocketeer. This book was a terrific introduction to high power - all the way to Level 3. I might have given it 5 stars, but the two-column per page format made it difficult to read, and too often the photos were not on the page where the text referred to them (too much page-flipping). I would blame this on the publisher not the author. I especially enjoyed the individual stories of people making their certification attempts. In fact, I am going out this weekend to do my Level 1 certification. Thanks for the help, Mark."
4,"Beware - Contains an Alternate Mix of ""Always the Sun""","Not much needs to be said about The Stranglers. They were great in the Hugh Cornwell days. Beware this collection if you're looking for the radio mix of ""Always the Sun"". The version of it here is the inferior ""Sunny Side Up Mix""."
5,A excellent book worth reading.,"This book is very good. It tells of a young girl,Mandie, who has come back to her home town to find out what is going at her father's house. Her father is now dead and her stepmother had once taken over the house. Mandie would like her house back. Mandie and her friend Joe decide to find out what is happening at her house. But they are stopped when someone shoots at them when they come close to the house. I believe this book is good because even though there are hard times Mandie and her friend Joe, trust God to help them"
4,Clarion Crossover,"This is a fantastic product for the price. The compact size was what really made it a great product. The bass levels on this cross over is quite amazing and with the right setup, you can get a very clean crisp sound."
2,I would look around first.,"I bought this about a year ago and it still works barely, it doesn't do much as far as helping your amps or purifying your music."
4,wcw /nwo fall brawl 1998,"disco inferno,alex wright vs british bulldog,jim neidhartjericho vs goldberg (fony)norman smiley vs the catscott stiener vs rick stienersilver king vs juventud guerreraraven vs saturncurt hennig vs dean melinkoscott hall vs konnanTEAM WCW TEAM NWO ""HOLLYWOOD""DDP & PIPER & WARRIOR vs HOGAN & STEVIE RAY & BRET HART vs STING LEX LUGER & KEVIN NASH (TEAM NWO WOLFPAC)"
3,WCW Fall Brawl 1998 Review,"In my opinion, this is one of the worst Fall Brawls ever made. The main event wasn't very good and the undercard was even worse. One of the reasons the main event was so bad was the finish: DDP giving a Diamond cutter to Stevie Ray. Plus, The Warrior made a less-than-stellar comeback with a one-minute chest pounding and then running off. The best thing about this event was that it set up the main event for 1998's Halloween Havoc: DDP vs. Goldberg for the heavyweight title. That was a great match. This video is not recommended."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this product as a gift for my sister and never actually used this product. She made multiple attempts over the course of several weeks, including two phone calls to customer service, to try to calibrate it correctly. It was quite high-tech, but did not provide accurate step counts any better than one obtained with a fast food happy meal. She was not successful and reluctantly returned it."
2,"Good product, bad reliability and support","I purchased this product around a year and a half ago. It worked great, as described by other reviewers, with a fairly accurate step count, good upload capability, and many more features than I ever needed.However, the initial unit died within the first 6 months, and the warranty replacement died at about one and a half years. At this point SportBrain is saying since it only has a 1 year limited warranty they won't repair it, replace it, nor sell me a refurbished unit at a discount.If you are happy with having to replace it every year or two its a good product, but I expect a bit more longevity out of my purchases."
2,not the best,"I bought this for my almost 2 yr old -- to give her when her new baby sister arrived. She loves doing buckles, snaps and zips. I thought this would be a great toy for her to have those activities (and more) all in one place. The zip is very short and difficult even for me to pull up and down. Button is difficult as well. My daughter likes to do the buckles that snap together (like in her carseat and high chair) -- this one is like a belt buckle where you thread it through a loop. The snap and velcro are together on the same pocket and you really need to squeeze the whole leg to get the snap done.Maybe if she were a couple years older it would be ""ok""...but definitely not appropriate for a 2 yr old."
2,zipity hard to do,"I purchased this for my 19 month old daughter for her to begin practicing dressing skills. After reading the review I decided that even though the toy recieved a bad review from the previous parent that it is hard to manipulate, I bought it because My daughter liked it and picked it out. Needless to say I should have listened to the previous reviewer. The toy is hard to manipulate even for me. The zipper pulls but gets stuck at the top and the button and snap are hard for little hands to manipulate. They were even hard for me to manipulate. The shoes are the only part of the item that are easy. These toys were meant to be easy to manipulate for little hands but this one is NOT! There ARE better dolls out there for the learn to dress part. My daughter likes the doll and carries it with her but the educational value of being able to do with the doll what you are suppposed to do is very limited. I got her the Carters learn to dress doll on Ebay that seems to be better. We'll see."
5,What an album!,"I am not a long standing Shawn Colvin fan. I found this CD in a salvage store...and bought it because I had recently go into a ""Few Small Repairs"". While I liked most of ""Repairs"" some songs were world class and others just OK...or better than average ""filler"" songs. I played ""Cover Girl"" for the first time not knowing what to expect. Many of these songs are live and the recording quality is astounding. For audiophiles who, like myself, believe how well the music is recorded is almost as important as the message the music conveys, this ablum delivers in spades. It is clear from the music and the album notes that Ms.Colvin has picked these songs very carefully...and is, in fact, deeply, emotionally involved in most of the music recorded here. This album is pure emotion, talent, a stool, a guitar...and THE voice to carry it off. I would recommend this for anyone who likes live acoustic music."
5,A fun album with a good range...,"I've been a Shawn Colvin fan since even before she came out with her own album. (I discovered her doing backups for/with other people I like, such as Mary-Chapin Carpenter and Lucy Kaplansky.) _Cover Girl_ is my second-favorite album of hers, next to her first. It has a good range of songs, and her cover of ""This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)"" (by The Talking Heads) is amazing and gives a much different feel to the song than the original. Other great songs are ""The Heart of Saturday Night"" (by Tom Waits), ""Killing the Blues"" (John Prine), ""Window to the World"" (by Greg Brown), and ""You're Gonna Make Me Lonesone When You Go"" (by Bob Dylan). The clearly marketable ""Every Little Thing (He) Does Is Magic"" (by The Police / Sting), while adept enough, I feel actually detracts from the overall mood of the album."
4,"Intimate, almost irresistible","Like many other reviewers, I backed into this one from ""A few small repairs"". Now this is the one I listen to more.The songs are simple, the accompaniment is clean, lean and tasteful, and Shawn's voice is a delight of breathy intimacy. I could have done without the Talking Heads song, and ""Every little thing"" is an amusing curiosity, but the rest are beauties."
3,Mixed bag of covers,"The cutely titled ""Cover Girl"" is a mixed bag of covers from a great singer/songwriter.At its best ""(Looking For) The Heart of Saturday Night,' ""One Cool Remove"" ""Killing the Blues,"" and the exquisite ""Twilight"" this album showcases Shawn's voice and her knack for good arrangements.But this does not help a lackluster version of The Police's Every Little Thing"" and several other songs that come across as little more than filler.If you are looking for an introduction to Shawn, pass this one by and get ""Live '88"" and ""A Few Small Repairs."""
5,One of my top ten ever CDs,"I love this album! I love Shawn Colvin's voice, and each and every song that she picked for this album is great, especially when perfomed by her. The songs are pretty mellow; I play the album when I want to relax, but I would not agree with the above that it is ""easy listening""; she is too deep and intense for that."
2,"Covers - some good, some so-so","I am a big fan of Shawn Colvin's and have been for 10 years. But this is easily my least favorite of her albums.The main problem is that these covers are uneven. Some are great, some are decent, some are so-so. It isn't a bad album, but why listen to this when you can listen to some of Shawn's great originals?"
4,A great book!,"This book is helpful, informative and easy to read. It gave me many ideas to help my young son with ASD. Kids learn through play, so this is a great tool for parents of autistic children. I am so glad I read it, and I highly recommend it."
1,"Boo, does not support multi-keyhole speakers",Buyer beware. I am out $30 (10% restocking fee + shipping) because the mounts were not compatible with my speakers which have 2 key holes ~ 8 inches apart. Make sure you contact the company before you buy.
4,They Work,I did not purchase these through Amazon as I was not satisfied with the vendor reviews. I also used these to hang Boston Acoustic CS26 bookshelf speakers. As in a previous review I am happy with the results aside from the fact that I had to use a strap wrench to tighten them up enough that they didn't move. This isn't a big deal as I won't be moving them around all the time but it would have been nice to be able to hand tighten.The speaker mounts came with plenty of hardware for an assortment of mounting options. They do a good job at holding the weight at the angle I want them. They seem to be constructed from quality materials and I am not concerned with the falling off the wall. I am not sure that I would want to hang anything heavier than 12-14 lbs. I don't care what they are rated for.
3,soso popo,"as a collection of class lecture notes this book has a right to bo verbose and disjointed,but it shouldn't make such abusive use of its rights."
4,"Not as Good as Secret Life, But A Good Value","As I learn that this show sill go of CBS this fall, I 'm glad this is out. Even though I prefer Secret Life, this is a good value and I hope I get this set soon!"
5,All The Mama's is wonderful.,"I cried the first time I read this book. It touches your heart, and your mind. It fills readers young and old with a connection for their past, and hope for the future, with it's lyrical and loving prose and pictures. It would make a great gift for a new mother or grandmother. I absolutly loved it.I would also recommend Pockets and The Malachite Palace, if you liked this book as much as my daughter and I did."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"This book gives a brief capsule of each era, and what mothers might have done with their daughters, reaffirming the love mothers have for their daughters. I read it to my twin daughters, and teared up. Strongly, strongly recommended."
4,Good but not great,"This book continues the adventures of Jason and company in Haven. I really enjoyed the previous books and was hoping this one would be as great. Unfortunately, it seems rather rushed. There are so many ideas in this book that go absolutley no where. And the ending, well, its like running real fast and then falling of a cliff. Hopefully there is another book in the works."
4,Gate of Bones Review,"This book was a little harder to follow than the rest of the books in the series.Yet the Magickers were dealing with numerous hardships: teenage insecurities, raids/attacks by the Dark Hand, learning an entirely new culture that was hinted at the end of Dragon Gate, AND they were dealing with the real possibility of losing their magic.It did take me a few reads through in order to get the full effect of the new world they find themselves in, little tidbits I had missed before began to stand out and helped bring everything together."
1,did nothing,This stuff did nothing good for my wool hat. All it did was add a little frosted look to my hat.
5,Vintage Shearing,If occasionally you like your soul touched by a fine relaxed jazz trio then you will like this one. Less syrup than found with Shearing's quintet work; this is my all-time favourite jazz trio recording. Got the old vinyl and was amazed to find the re-release on CD. Buy it for those evenings when you are feeling a little introspective and want to listen to something evocative.
3,WAITING FOR PRINCE CHARMING!,Just planted a cherry tomato plant and used this fertilizer... so I'm waiting to see what kind of results we will have once the plant starts producing tomatoes. We're hoping HAPPY FROG turns intoa PROLIFIC PRINCE! We'll see...
2,Just stopped working,This worked great while it worked. Have had it about 1 1/2 years and it just stopped working (volume control cont. to work). Too much money for something that doesn't last. Read similar complaints on Apple website while trying to troubleshoot.
1,Did not work properly,The product only worked for about 1 hour after which is was impossible to change the radio station - then it refused to play any audio through the ear phones.Also the product number label had a white sticker placed over it as though this wasn't what was ordered. Very strange.
5,great book,My husband really likes it and the maps for flight simulator. It is recommended for anyone who is into the sr-71.
4,THE biography of Blackwood,"Blackwood's life was indeed extraordinary, and so was the man. When you write about such an incredible character, you can hardly go wrong. This book is, to date, THE standard biography of Algernon Blackwood, one of the greatest supernatural tale writers of all times (trust not me, but the sound judgement of HP Lovecraft!). As one can sense from his writings, Blackwood had a copious first-hand experience of the weird."" An extraordinary Life"" follows AB through his pilgrimages around the world, tries its best to peep into the life of a quite mysterious fellow, and traces some of the sources of his wondrous tales. The last part is perhaps a bit boring, but hei, if you are a Blackwood's aficionado, this is a must.PS Nobody knows yet the true identity of Dr. Silence: the case is open for further investigations."
3,THANKS,"THE PRODUCT I DELAY A LITTLE IN ARRIVING, BUT FINALLY IT ARRIVED, GOOD DISPOSITION OF THE SUPPLIER IN OFFERING TO RESEND THE PRODUCT IN CASE IT DID NOT ARRIVE"
1,The title is deceptive,"I bought this book assuming it would give help in dealing with the alcoholic but was very disappointed. If you are doing research this book may be fine, but it is not for self-help."
2,Lumps ALL Alcoholics into 3 categories,"This book is based on the TA concept (trans-analysis by Eric Berne, BTW- THIS book is NOT by Eric Berne). Basically meaning everything we do is based on how we grew up/how people treated us throughout our lives. However, I know a lot of alcoholics (including my father and an ex-husband) and many don't fit into 1 of the 3 categories.Very disappointing."
4,I like this!,"I'm happy with this little disc; it has an extra ball for the bottom, for more advanced work. My trainer likes it too!"
2,"I love Jimmy, but wish he used his racquet in this one","Jimmy does too much watching and not enough instructing. There's a segment with a blonde babe serving over and over again while Jimmy and John Lloyd watch and comment. Weird and awkward. The Bryan brothers show up and demonstrate the serve, incorrectly labeling one of the grips! Seriously? The saving grace of this DVD is Tracy Austin demonstrating the Volley. She knows more about teaching than anyone in the film. She needs to make her own DVD. Hey, I'm a teaching professional...I think I'll make one. Really hard to find a good product out there."
3,Works ok,"Nice that it has 2 handles and shipped 2 life jackets, within the first 2 weeks of using the product the seams came undone. So it was nice to have another as a back up."
2,Pet Life Jacket,The X-Small item does not fit the size of dog as stated. I would not order for anything over 9 lbs. Also the zipper would not stay zipped.
1,doggy life vest,not very good at all. spend a few dollars more to get better quality. the zipper doesn't stay closed. this is a defect with all mediums i tried. my dog swims and the zipper comes down therefore the vest is ineffective.
3,LATE,"FIRST TIME EVER, A product that I ordered from this company has been SO LATE. BUT I do like the quality of the life vest I ordered."
3,Confused,"Rated a 3 r/t size: What to do? I measured my dog every which way - and girth size 30. That's the cut-off for L to XLg. I ordered L. She is a very small German Shepherd - not even 60 lbs. I can get it zipped by pulling and stretching but I'm not sure she can breathe. If I order larger, would I be able to get a snug fit? She isn't a water dog and only thing I know is to put her on a diet. Otherwise...love the yellow color and the handles and it's easy to put on. Haven't tried it so don't know if it will keep her afloat but quality looks good."
4,As good as the original,"This is quite a good video pack on fast and furious fighting with or without weapons. In that it is quite similiar to Vunak's Street Safe Series or R.A.T Fighting System (hurt, straight blast, terminate). Nevertheless it's still a good source of fighting information even if you already own the aforementioned videos."
2,Dangerously incomplete,This book is not badly written but fails to point out serious and important facts about rebuilding a vw diesel engine. You are much better off getting the bentley vw diesel manual.
2,Beware!!!!,"The patterns in this book look absolutely beautiful on the pages but the book was not originally published in the US. There are instructions for converting British Crochet to US Crochet online, but now that I have found this out I have given up on this book. Also the yarn that is used can only be found online for extremely high prices. If you don't want to do that you have to convert the yarn into what is available in the US. Just a note...the white cardigan that held my fancy when purchasing this book would cost over 100 dollars to make if you bought the comparable yarn in the US. I would stay away! (but the patterns look so pretty) Pretty..Yes...but are they worth the effort and money?"
4,Great Style,"There are some beautiful patterns in this book, very trendy. I don't know if this book was originally intended for the U.S. or if it was translated or from the U.K. There are some quirks in the patterns that will hopefully be ironed out w/newer editions. My other complaint is the use of high priced yarn, many I've never heard of, but substitution is always an option. Despite the quirks and yarn, I would recommend this book for anyone interested in high fashion crochet."
1,Buyer beware,You need to be aware that it takes 10 working days after you contact these people before they getr back to you on how they will service your unit. You must know how much you paid for the unit before taxes before they will even set you up for a service call back. I think this is rediculous!
4,conversations to go,"With 4 elementary school children, it is sometimes hard to have a coherant conversation at mealtimes. The kids look forward to new questions, (and there are a lot!), it gives us insight to what they may have learned from friends and food for thought for our own views."
2,"Some interesting information, but overall disappointing.","I was excited to find this DVD when I searched for Arctic wildlife. However, once I got it I was disappointed to find that it included a lot of stock film spliced into the ""video"" itself. The quality was alternately good and terrible given the fact that it was pretty poorly edited. At least there are some nice facts about breeding grounds and animal behaviour, but on the whole it really isn't worth $20.00."
5,Thirteen Excellent Mysteries,"Every one of these mysteries is very good, which is sometimes unusual in an anthology. If you are a fan of Diane Mott Davidson, Sharon McCrumb, Joan Hess, Charlotte MacLeod, or Carolyn G. Hart, you will love this book. There's not a clinker in the bunch"
2,Boring,"I was disappointed in this anthology of mysteries. I was looking forward to reading some good mystery stories and discover a few new authors while I was at it. These all seemed to be written by amatuer writers, and the stories were boring."
1,More boring than church,"I'm a science DVD junkie, but I couldn't even finish watching this garbage. This video has truly state-of-the-art visuals--or at least, it would if it had been released in 1972 instead of 2007. I've seen local car-dealership commercials with higher production values. And I'm pretty sure that the narrator was actively trying to bore me. I wish I had just spent the money on another episode of NOVA."
2,Not serious science,"I was expecting something informative and entertaining; unfortunately, I got neither. Most of the information was either boring and appropriate for a grade school audience or not explained adequately or properly. The visuals and writing are also extremely poor. I love astronomy and learning, I found this DVD to be very juvenile. My husband likes fun interesting facts, he thought the DVD was boring. Hence, I would not really recommend this for anyone...maybe little kids interested in science...not sure how entertaining they would find it though."
3,Ace rocks,"Great sound, great band, great cd!! Met them at cornerstone last summer..good group of guys and great act!"
5,i love it,i really like this cd because of its songs they grow on youi think estella and numinous are the slowest types so slow that they are almost ballads the strongest the madness of the crowds and amanda its definitely a good cd if you are open to different tempos of music i recommend that you buy it or at least hear it before buying it and then buy it.
5,Yeah more Vegas keep it coming,"Slowly but surely we are finally getting the series on dvd. This will complete the second season of this neat Robert Urich series.Filled with a Vegas background, raving beauties and handsome lead man make this a winner. Plus so many classic tv stars like on Love Boat guest every week.Maureen McCormick, Red Buttons,June Lockhart, Robert Reed, Dick Sargent, Priscilla Barns, Heather Menzies and the list goes on....... Plenty of action keeps this series very entertaining plus our lead man changes his shirt on camera at least two times and episode insuring many female and male viewers to some wonderful eye candy.Robert is gone but lives on in our hearts a truly dramatic actor, and great man gone too soon."
5,finally on DVD,I liked this show when it originally aired. glad it is finally on DVD.hope they get the rest of the seasons out soon
1,Stop the Madness,Vegas was a great show but it seems that the owners of Spelling Productions is trying bilk their fans out of extra money. This only contains 11 of 22 episodes but they are charging like you are getting a full season! Do not buy any show that splits the seasons. Send a message to studios that we are not going to put up with their games and refuse to buy these ripoff box sets.
1,great idea bad design,The suction cup just does not work. Buy the one that screws on to the edge of a table. Improve the suction cup and you have a great item.
1,Applepeeler-Appleshredder,"This item was a birthday gift for my sister, and she gave it back because she said the suction did not work and the peeler did nothing but shred the apple. It is being returned."
1,Does not do the job with anything but very small apples.,I'm sorry to say that this product did not work for my needs. I tried it on medium sized apples and potatoes. Neither worked successfully. I'm very disappointed.
2,Not very adaptable.,"I purchased this on a whim (reminded me of one my father used to have), and initially I was very pleased. It did not peel apples that were too small or too large, and would not peel any apple that was not very firm. However, when it worked, it worked marvelously, and I used it for a few days while I was making lots of apple pies. Afterwards I washed it in the dishwasher to get all the surfaces clean and sterilized for storage. Since then the suction cup has completely failed to work, and since I'm complaining I might mention that the peeler is very dull. I would not buy this again."
2,Hard to use,"Doesn't lock well on table, apple wabbles and it's just hard to use. I think I'll go back to the old fashioned knive."
2,not easy to use,its cheap but its not as easy to use as it looks like. its not clean peel and hard to adjust to correct cutting distance to have minimum wastage of skin peeled off.
4,Basics Apple Peeler,"This is a neat apple peeler. I first saw it in a cooking class and ordered one for myself. It takes the peel right off, the core is removed and the apple comes out in a long ring attached to each other. It is quicker than my using a knife, and safer."
4,Home Made is Best,We're very pleased with the apple corer - peeler. We've started making old fashioned apple butter and this has been such a time saver.
1,Buyer beware,This piece of equipment is very hard to adjust and the blade does not cut well at all. Major waste of money!
1,Arrived with a broken handle in the box.,The little bit that the wood hand attaches to was snapped in half. I'm if it was due to pore packaging on the sellers part which was just the products box in a brown shipping box with no sort of cushioning at all be it packaging peanuts or those air filled bags most people use. Or it could just be that its made of bad material. I'm no metal expert or anything but this thing was light weight. When I went to pick it up I was expecting some heft to it but it was like picking up a box of paper.All of that makes a 1 star and I would consider shopping around locally before you try to get one of these off Amazon as they all look the same.
3,great for apples not potatoes,"I just couldn't get it to peel potatoes maybe it was me, apples were easy and will cut apple curls really nice."
2,Piece of Junk,"Every fall we go apple picking and then have to cut up the apples for cooking. I had a Pampered Chef apple peeler/corer for years and absolutely loved it. When parts of it finally wore out, I saw this model on amazon and gave it a try. Total waste of my time and money! The peeler peels only a fraction of the apple and the corer is not sharp enough to cut through the apple, leaving me with a mushy mess. I've tried lots of different apple varieties and it makes no difference. I am now back to preparing apples by hand. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because I did like the suction base that attached to the counter top."
5,my favorite kitchen gadget gift,"I love mine so much, it has become my favorite thing to give my friends who also like to cook, expecially the ones who bake. Though sturdy (cast iron, I guess), it is fairly small and lightweight. It is very easy to suction to the counter by moving the lever. I've been told that the clamp on version is much more of a pain to use. It peels, cores and slices an apple in 7 seconds. Though I haven't tried it yet, I think you can move the peeler blade out of the way if you just want to core and slice. Fun to use! I have not tried potatoes."
1,not worth purchasing,"This product would work great if apples were all round. However, if your apples are not round, this will take off enough peel and apple to make it round. The spring is too strong to allow the peeler to work with the shape of the apple and instead makes the apple fit the shape the peeler wants. At this time we are looking for a final resting place for this item."
4,It does as it says.,This gadget does what it says it does and does it fairly well. The suction base is somewhat weak and I have to re-suction it frequently when processing large amounts of produce.I do wish it had additional threaded shafts that would allow it to slice different thicknesses (I used to have one that did) but I can't hold that against it.It sure beats processing things by manually performing thees tasks.
4,Great product with ripe apples,This is a great product as long as your apples are firm and crisp. Once the apples start to get soft the peeler can't grab a hold of the skin. I used it to peel apples for my wife making pies and apple sauce and it was great. It was like a production line. I would recommend it if you need to peel a bunch of apples at a time. It is also easy to wash.
4,good product,"I like this product. I purchased it not only to peel and cut apples but also potatoes, yams, etc. I make many home made fries and this works well. I just wish there was a way to use it and have it cut the item without coring it also."
2,Arrived broken,"I was really looking foward to receiving this peeler as I've heard how many others like it. It arrived very quickly, but it wasn't protected well in the package and the ""arm"" that guides the apple was broken totally off the peeler. It was loose in the clear package that was stapled together. I was disappointed that I had to return it."
4,great for multiple apples!,"I only use this product once a year during apple picking season, but I use it to make eeeeeverything. It's a pain to clean and I worry about it rusting, but it saves so much time! It cuts everything evenly so my pies and fried apples are cooked evenly and extra delicious!"
1,Did not meet expectations,"My engineer/mechanic husband even couldn't figure out this machine. What a waste of time and energy. I did, however, also purchase the starfrit 93013 peeler and LOVE it! I like to slice my own apples to suit the purpose, so wasn't going to use the slicer feature on the back-to-basics peeler. It didn't work anyway."
5,Love it!,"Every year I use this to peel and slice 2 bushels of apples. Each bushel weighs about 48 lbs. You do the math . I can apple slices and dehydrate them too. This cuts a perfect thickness for both about 1/4 "". You can't beat it for the price. Its a great value. I have owned mine two years & its still humming right along. Buy one !!!"
5,Great Apple peeler,"This works better than I imagined. Love how the suction works and so easy to core, peel and slice apples. Love it."
3,Not perfect,"It really does take peelings off, core and slice the apple at the same time. This saves a lot of time perparing apples for pies, etc. However,it sometimes skips over sections of the apple skin when peeling. Because at that point in the process the apple is already sliced and partially cored so you cannot go back. I do not know why it does this but it still is a great time saver. Cleans off just rinsing well under hot water."
5,Detailed engineered for ease and speed,This model is the best of 3 that I have purchased over 20 years. The detail of having the release on the same side that you are peeling from means you don't have to reach over to the far side to release the crank shaft. This means you can get onto the next apple or potato quicker.
2,potato nightmare,I bought this to use for mashed potatoes on thanksgiving.. too bad your potatoes have to be all the exact same size in order for it to do anything.. You can change the placement of the blade but that leaves you with a 1/4 peeled potato.. and when you move it closer it takes off half of the potato.. i gave up after trying 3 or so and peeled them by hand.. I think it will however work well on apples and will try it soon.
4,Great peeler,This is my second one since the handle of the first one broke. Once it's broken there was no way to glue it back. I've had the previous one for years. I had to get a new one since we had just gone apple picking and having to peel a box of apples by hand didn't sound appealing.
2,Arrived Broken,"It was obviously made of cheap metal, the handle was cracked off in the box when it arrived. i think the product itself is amazing, when its good quality it works amazingly well, but im looking for a different manufacturer."
3,Overall good,"Overall this is a great product but their is one downside. Unless you have a very suction cup friendly counter it can be tough to get it to stay stuck to the counter. It does a a great job of skinning apples, that is for sure."
3,Wish I got the clamp model,"I didn't realize when I was ordering that there's a suction cup model and a clamp model. I'm not impressed with the suction cup - it always comes undone even though I follow the instructions. As for the peeler section, you need to use fresh, firm, symmetrical apples for it to work great. Otherwise, it doesn't work well."
5,Magic Peeler,"Back to basics, ""Apple and Potato PeelterWe have an apple tree and used to let many fall on the ground. Not anymore. This tool is great! Peels slices and cores with ease. Easy to clean. No maintenance!. Suction model sticks to any top. Works on other fruits like pears. Just make sure they are hard.Back To Basics Apple And Potato Peeler"
3,GREAT until the base became loose and wobbly... 2nd day of use...,Wonderful item but after peeling about a dozen apples the base loosened and my husband had to take it apart and tighten it. No easy task...
3,"It works great, but...","IT works great. However, it cut too much apples and make the apple smaller than I expected. Overall, if you don't mind to get a smaller apple, it is very good tool. It is fast to peel the skins and cut it into smaller pieces. My wife likes it very much since it make her easy to chew the apple."
1,Not a great gadget,"I love gadgets, especially if they make your life easier. I found this to be a confusing mess. Not all apples are created equally. I can peel, pare, core, using a great sharp paring knife in half the time it took to set this contraption up. The stick to any surface feature hah..,adjust the setting for each apple hah..,clean up the mess hah..No thanks, I put it back in it's box and into the garage sale pile."
2,In the cupboard - Not User Friendly,This IMHO is not intuitive or easy to use. To many variables to account for. People are too busy and dont have time to fine tune this to take off just enough peel. Maybe the mfg could put up a video to address the concerns. So for those of us who bought this can get some use out of it. I know I cannot be alone.
4,Gift but pricey,I got this for my father in law and he seems to like it. I thought that it was a bit pricey for an apple peeler.
3,"Bad Manufacturer, Decent Product","It's a great idea.But it wasn't put together well.The first one we bought came with a defective screw inside of the suction cup in the base.The thing came apart. We returned it.The second one we bought-- THE RAZOR BLADE WAS INSTALLED BACKWARDS.So do we like it? As much as we like apples. But if you choose to buy this appliance,please check it thoroughly when you core your first one. We fixed it ourselves.They may have screwed it backwards."
3,Needs tweaking...,"Out of the box, this is a poor performing item. Mangles apples to the n-th degree. HOWEVER, I have found that almost retail items designed to cut, do NOT come with a sharp edge...not even CLOSE. I can sharpen almost anything, so I proceeded to put a shaving-sharp edge on both the curved peeling blade, the straight slicing blade and the round coring blade. Took about 30 minutes to redefine the bevels and gentle reestablish a fine edge, followed by a stropping/polishing session. Works great now. Takes more flesh off the fruit that with hand peeling, but its a time saver. So if you have the time and expertise to do some fettling, it's ok. As far as potatoes go, I don't know how it would work. I never peel 'em (use them with skins on)."
3,Finally wore out,"We have had our peeler for six or seven years and use it primarily for apples. This year it started skipping badly unless I hold extra pressure on the thread follower mechanism. It appears that the threads are wearing so the follower jumps out with the pressure of forcing the apple thru the cutters. It has been an excellent product and makes the job of peeling apples for applesauce a breeze so I expect that we will buy another one. I am very disappointed, however, that it has worn out so quickly."
2,It's not so good,I bought this and the suction cup is cool but it took too much off the potatos and apples and does not really conform to the different shapes as other models do. I may use it as a decoration now.
5,super easy; you'll eat more apples!,"I never thought to review this handy kitchen tool, but I was writing my brother-in-law my latest apple-buckwheat-sweet-quick-bread-recipe and thought I should send a link with the best peeler in the world ... and here it is! I use this for potatoes as well ... you can use the peeling blade or not - I usually just use it to slice and core - my dogs and I eat apples every day with this wonderful device - easy to clean - easy to use - everyone who eats apples or makes potato salad would benefit!One tip, when putting the apple onto the prongs, line it up with the bottom of the apple, I know that must seem obvious, but sometimes you look at the entire apple, and one side has grown fatter, but it looks round and then put the apple on crooked ... and even if you do it's no biggie!"
4,Apple Peeler,"The peeler fastens to the table very well. The apple mounts on the peeler easy. But it needs round apples to core well. It dose very well peeling potatoes, makes curly fries fun. I would recommend this product to a friend."
1,useless,"this ithem did not peel apples nor potatoes,the instructions for use were not clear enough,i wish i could return it."
1,another piece of junk that doesnt work,it doesnt work-- read the bad reviews-- i found the same problems- dont waste yer time or money---its useless junk---
2,Apple And Potato Peeler,"You need to have small, perfectly shaped applesworked fine with apples that were 2"" in diameter or less, and had no imperfections"
2,that's ok,well wrong kind of box not incudles with potato only apple that all not right box work ok that all.
4,Very fast,"I've never used one of these but was impressed how quickly you can peel, core, and slice apples with it. It was a total breeze and fun. Supposedly you can peel potatoes with this and make shoestring fries but my effort proved futile. The potatoes must be uniform in shape and I find it difficult to find such potatoes so I'll stick with the apples. That being said, it was really easy to assemble and clean afterwards. The paint protects the cast iron so there isn't such a chance for rust."
2,Suction Cup Quickly Wears Out,"I purchased this peeler in November 2011. The peeling function works great. However the rubber suction cup that secures it to the counter will no longer produce enough suction to make the product stable enough to use. The item was not heavily used, perhaps once or twice per month. It was only used when my wife made apple pies since we never bother peeling potatoes.Now I am in the market for another peeler with a more durable mechanism for securing to a table top or counter. If you look at this item as disposable after 1 year, then go ahead and purchase. But if you want a kitchen utensil that will provide years of use, do not purchase this product.I give it two stars because the peeling function works quite well. But it is now useless since it can no longer be secured to the table."
4,Fun way to make applesauce,"This product is just plain fun. We have had various adults using this apple peeler and corer one made cooked apples, another made apple sauce, and another made apple turnovers. That was not good for my diet but it sure was good. Usually the peeling and coring is for our home made applesauce using Gala apples. The installation and operation of peeling and coring an apple is easy and job turns out to be fun. My 82 year old mother in law loves peeling and coring her apples with this tool so she does not get the apple peel in her teeth. If you are thinking about getting an apple peeler, get this one."
2,Rarely use it!,What's touted as an apple and potato peeler can barely do the job with a well-rounded apple and hardly works on potatoes!The tool requires that products be well-rounded and of even surface - and that's hardly the case with most potatoes.I bought it a while back and hardly used it more than twice. Not worth the $20!
4,This works,"This works well, but it is not what we expected because it is a lot of work to peel potatoes when you can do it quicker yourself with a peeler. Also, if the object being peeled isn't perfectly symetrical, it won't work."
2,Too hard for me,I could not seem to find the correct size apple to peel.More time to drag out and line up apple.Hand peeler works for me!!
4,Apple-Potato Peeler,We had so many apples on our tree this year and it was too difficult to peel all of them so I purchased the peeler. It has helped tremendously!! I had a littleproblem with the large apples breaking into but most worked great. I am happywith the purchase for the money I spent.
3,Not bad not great,"Does a nice job of slicing, peeling and coring apples that are fairly evenly shaped all the way around. Not so good at all three operations when the apple is not evenly shaped. Had to remove them from the peeler and do them by hand....which were quite a few. Also need to continually check the alignment of the slicer/corer to make sure they were in line with the feed arm otherwise it can be easily bent out of shape. Haven't tried it yet with potatoes."
3,Comes in handy,"I have an apple tree in my backyard. This item is not for a person with more than ONE apple to peel at a time. Often, I make an apple salad for one person. It works well enough for that purpose. However, for the peeler to be held in place, the surface must be ABSOLUTELY smooth, even then the suction did not adhere throughout the entire procedure. I had to reset it, then finally hold it down with my other hand. I also placed a paper towel on the peeler, under the apple to catch the juice that drips down while the apple is being prepared. Hence 3 stars. After purchasing this little peeler, I also purchased an electric peeler that peels several apples at a time...to meet my demand for 'a peeler that handles many apples at a time.'"
1,Not at all a potato peeler,"I haven't tried this product on apples yet because I bought it to peel potatoes, which I have since found, it does not. The problem is most potatoes are not completely round, so what ends up happening is some sides of the potato get deep gashes in them and other sides aren't touched by the peeler at all. The device is way too small for most medium to large potatoes, also. In addition, I found that the suction mechanism worked in the short term while I was trying to peel potatoes, but it doesn't stay suctioned to the counter (mine is formica, but I also tried it on stainless steel with the same result) long term. I guess I'll go back to peeling potatoes the old fashioned way."
1,pure unaduterated JUNK!!!,"this poorly constructed apple peeler is fine if, 1. you use it once a year. 2. cut only very small apples. 3.don't cut potatoes. 4. don't mind when the suction pad ""unglues"". 5. don't mind when the handle disconects from the arm. 6. don't mind when the skins cling to the blade. and yes the big bonus..IT RUSTS!!!!"
4,"Works great, wish I could core without slicing, though","I bought this because it was the highest rated apple peeler/corer/slicer by Cook's Illustrated. We processed over two bushels of apples in a day with it. It works really well, as long as you have it adjusted properly. I do wish that it could peel and core without slicing, and I wish I could adjust how thick the slices are. I also got some rusting around the spring and the screw, so I wish that they were stainless. Overall, though, a cheap product that does exactly what it's supposed to and saved me hours."
2,not what I hoped for,"if you want to peel potatoes good lock, haven't tried it with apples but I'm not impressed, It wastes to much, you still need a regular peeler to finish up all the places it misses. I'm not sorry I bought it but's it not all that."
5,Loving It!,"I love this product! It makes apple preperation soooo much easier! I prepped 20 apples for homeade apple butter in like 15 minutes! You do need to clean it or at least soak some of the parts fairly quickly, because once the apples/juice starts to dry it can be difficult to clean. Also make sure when you use this put some foil or plastic wrap under it to collect the juice that drips down, it can be a bit sticky. Overall this is a great time saver that works above expectations!"
3,"Good for small, perfectly shaped apples","After using this to peel and core nearly 1 bushel of heirloom apples, I have to say I wish there were other machines designed to do this chore. The Back to Basics model worked fine with apples that were 2"" in diameter or less, and had no lumps, bumps or imperfections on the surface. However, many of my apples weighed nearly 1 pound each and were too large to be peeled with this machine. Also, if there were any flaws on the surface of the apple, the blade gouged into the meat rather than just peeling the fruit. It works, but the limitations make it not as user-friendly as I would like."
5,Great product,"Very pleased with this product. Performance has been very good and our 3-year-old loves turning the handle to ""help"" Dad peel his apples."
5,Poetry From Latin Pop's Queen,"Shakira is not only the strongest songwriter in the genre of Latin pop, she is also one of the most gifted singers. All Shakira's music is poetry. Her songs are beautiful, her spoken word is eloquent and delicate, her voice is hers- there is no comparison.""Underneath Your Clothes"" is a quasi-ballad. Think of it as excellent poetry with music. (This is how you should think of all songs). The mixes distort the beauty of the song. I personally think the acoustic is the best version on here because it proves how beautifull Shakira can sing and play without the enhanced distractions.Watch this girl take over the charts with her next single, ""Fool."""
3,Not her best read.,While she finally ties the books together in a conclusion this is not her best work. It was a rather tedious read and not her best work. While it was still worthwhile it was rather wordy and rambling for this author and not up to her usual standards. It was as if she felt like she didn't have enough story line to fill the whole book but things she alluded to could have filled it in nicely. It was quite slow at times and somehow just didn't seem to totally flow like the previous books did. It's almost like she ran out of steam at the end of the series.
2,Hmm..,"I waited so long for this book.. I counted the days till it came out! Then I read it in one day and finished feeling a little lost. The book goes slow and main characaters are left out in the dust, like Abe for example which is hardly talked about at all. I was really sadendeed by the outcome of Lydie and Jake too. I've loved every book in the series before this one.. but this one, sadly, seemed rushed and itn't beverly lewis's best work"
5,Beyond Explanation Marks!!!!!,"This book is truly the great ending to a wonderfully written Christian fiction series containing romance, suspense, mystery, historically correct and educational information all bound up into one! Truths are revealed to Jake and Lydiann, and yes, Leah discovers the identity of her birth father. What happened to Sadie? Did Leah and Jonas finally marry? What about poor Lydiann and Jake? Get the book and discover the answer to all your questions. You will not be disappointed in this last book of a great series."
3,Anti-Climax,"I don't know if I am qualified to write a review for this being that I didn't read any other book in this series except The Betrayal which is excellent. However, this book comes off as a somewhat sappy close to a over-dramatic saga and I feel like the story had outstayed it's welcome and I was glad to say a dignifying goodbye to the none the less great characters Beverly Lewis created."
5,Great Service,Thank you so much for getting the book to me in a prompt manner. I was anxious to see how the series was going to end.
5,Excellent Book,Love this book. Beverly lewis is a great author. If you love Amish books you are going to love this one!!!
2,The Revelation,Great! A suprising ending to the last book of the series. Didn't want to put the book down. Thanks for such great books.
5,Wonderful!,Was so happy to read this book! I've not been able to do much else since starting in book 1! How sweet this whole series!
4,good for emergencies,"I purchased this unit to include in my emergency kit. It packs a lot of good function into one unit.There are a couple things that would have made it better.One is a digital tuner for the radio. It's an old-style thumbwheel, so you'll need to twiddle a bit to tune into the signal.The weather radio is missing one very important feature: emergency alert.I'm not disappointed because it provides so much, but I do wish the radio was better."
3,"Cute and easy to use, but wouldn't hold an FM station","When I bought this, I wanted a replacement for the 25-year-old radio in my kitchen with a broken antenna and a broken battery compartment. I liked this radio as soon as I opened the box, but when I plugged it in, I was less than impressed. It wouldn't hold an FM station and the sound was tinny. No matter what I did, it continually lost the station. Needless to say, the old radio got plugged back in and this one was returned. The company was very gracious about the return (thankfully) and returned my money, minus the restocking charge, as promised."
4,A Strange Opera; Good Performances Though,"The production is fine, the performances are all good, but I find that this opera leaves me a little cold. It is too outlandish (if that is possible). I guess it is what it is; marrying Gilbert's interest in fairy stories with his satire of Parliament. What an odd mind Gilbert must have had to write this libretto.Like anything else, though, if one loves G&S, this is a good CD to have in the collection; and the patter song in this opera is perhaps the hardest in the entire G&S inventory, finely done by Richard Suart as the Lord Chancellor.Excellent performances; the score is excellent."
4,Bears more than one readig,"Dr. Kastner's style is very down-to-earth yet transmits concentrated, dense information/wisdom that parents probably need to read more than once to fully absorb. The one disappointment is the lack of an index. As I put down the book and later picked it up to review, I always found myself going to the index and finding there was none. The material would be more accessible if an index were added, as the table of contents isn't sufficiently detailed to help locate very specific points."
4,"Bought for an adult, not a child","I enjoyed giving this to my grown son who now owns a Harley. I don't think he has taken it for a ride...but if he does a charity ride, it should be there! :)"
3,Dimensions?,What are the dimensions for this Rolling 3-Tier Caddy? We have only 5 inches between our washer and dryer. Wonder if this will fit in that space?
3,laundry caddy,"I liked the laundry caddy, it was a little shakey but did serve the purpose. I am glad I ordered it."
1,Collapsing caddy,"This caddy is very poor quality. Because the shelves are not firmly fastened on, they shift and the caddy collapses whenever you try to roll it. I returned it immediately and unfortunately, the parcel post cost was high ($15) because the shipping box exceeded dimension limits."
1,Total thumbs down...,This is too small for the Game Boy SP and more than 2 games. It also doesn't stay closed very well. Don't waste your money!
2,It doesn't close up very well...,"It's a decent size bag and has a mesh pocket that holds the game boy advance sp firmly in place, BUT, it has NO storage space for games, and doenst close up very well. It opens like an envelope (the top part folds down over the front of the bag which has a U-shaped opening) and has just a single clasp on the front bottom. Some pockets for the games, or at least a zipper would have made this a much better accessory. It holds the GBA-SP, A/C adapter and a link cable ok, but, the games are loose in the bag and can easily fall out. If you want 1 bag to hold all your game boy stuff, this ain't it!"
5,Great Case of Room,"This case is great.It has so much room inside for a little case.I reccomend you buy it!You can fit all you games,accessories &up to 2 consoles. This product is great."
2,Seems like hype,A lot of words. A lot of diet stuff to make one feel it will be a nice tool to control one's weight. Not so much.
2,Original Sears Craftsman Husqvarna Part # 130861 CABLE ENG ZONE CO,"I have nothing against the Seller they were excellent. Also the rating really does not count in my case.I got the part# right out of my Sears Lawnmower Manual, unfortunately it's the wrong part for my mower and it was too long failing to work correctly. Back to using my tie wrap for now :)If your Mower has a nut and bolt holding the cable at the top of the handle this part should work for you, if it has a plastic rod ""like mine does"" it's going to be too long.My bad for buying Sears products :("
2,Very Basic information if your at all familiar with Probiotics,"Very basic info regarding probotics, does not go into different types and how to pick out a strain. Must have been backed by the dairy industry, seem to push yogart and other dairy products with probiotics. The best way to get the good bacteria is via refrigerated capsules."
3,basketball hardball,"well written, if conventional, small town murder mystery. well paced, easy to visualize. main characters are clearly drawn. a law professor's journal articles provide interesting ruminations."
1,LAS VEGAS STRIP DVD,"This DVD was horrible. I also failed to realize that this DVD was only ten minutes long and sadly, I paid over ten dollars for it. Luckily, I have been to Vegas before so I know what vegas has to offer, but for someone who has never been, this DVD offers no insight to Las Vegas and only shows a glimpse of a few of the hotels on the Las Vegas strip. (I could have put together a better DVD than this one)!"
1,It does not show the crook,"I did not like this book because at the end, all it says is that the baby alligtors crawl out of the mom's mouth. I would rate 0 stars but you can't!!!!!!!!"
4,Outstanding direction for a Christ-centered life,"The Stewardship Mandate provides a practical approach to how we are called to live our lives. It provides enough perspective and support to share your reasons and convictions with family and friends while at the same time detailing a practical roadmap to honor God in all activities you choose to participate. I think it's a great combination of concepts from movements like 7 Habits and Crown Ministries to give structure and purpose to our daily lives. If you are looking for an approach you can follow everyday that honors Him, this is the book to read.John HeadDallas, TX"
3,No Energy,"There is a certain amount of energy that I expect from this artist and in this effort it was missing, even so it was Ok!"
1,"Not Roxy brand, dont be deceived","cute item for an MP# BUT IT'S NOT A ROXY BRAND. I searched for Roxy and got this item, thought it was a Roxy branded item. Its not, still cute."
2,Not a great introduction to Nina Simone,"In the liner notes of this CD, the writer tells you that Nina Simone was not pleased with what was recorded finally to become ""Baltimore,"" and that he disagreed with her opinion that this was inferior work. But I have to agree with Ms. Simone.I am a HUGE fan of her music, and would like to steer potential fans to greater albums like ""Wild is the Wind"" or ""High Priestess of Soul."" Or if you're looking for a collection, ""The Best of Nina Simone"" (a live recording) is a seminal work with a most amazing rendition of Leonard Cohen's ""Suzanne"" on it. Or even the Nina Simone collection in the Sony Walkman Jazz series is a good intro to the eclectic song-styling, singing, arranging and piano playing of Ms. Simone.When you listen to these other albums you will see why Nina Simone knew she could do better than ""Baltimore."" Definitely do not judge her artistry by this album."
5,"Thanks to the movie ""Point of No Return""","I first heard Nina Simone's great voice in the movie ""Point of No Return,"" with Bridget Fonda and Gabriel Beryn (sp?) and that cutie Dermot Mulroney (the fiance from ""My Best Friend's Wedding."" Anyway, Nina Simone's voice was an inspired choice for the heroine to listen to. Simone is passionate and inspired. I would recommend this album highly, along with ""Nina at Newport,"" ""Nina at Town Hall,"" etc. In fact, buy all you can afford. She is a diva. One of the all-time greats."
3,the album seemed to start off with a reggae feel to it,"yes it was the first album of ninas that i had listened to,after hearing some of her music in a film about an assasin.although it started with a reggae sound in baltimore,it followed into a very relaxed type of sound that reminded myself of past loves.looking forward to listening to more of ninas works,maybe the box set maybe also of the same standard"
3,VOODOO SHIELD,Learning the Voodooo Shield alone is worth getting this dvd. It can easily be added to any system and used instantly. Can definately save you some dental work. Pretty well rounded dvd.
5,"If you love maps,rivers, river life, river facts and photos...............",".....you'll love this book. It is large in a school book fashion. I bought it for my husband who reads maps like books and loves topography/geography/geology. He really liked this tome. It centers on criteria/info on a large number of rivers and outlines the major basins with detailed descriptions of each river, life within and alteration to the flow and course. I was amazed at how many dams have been built - only 2-3 major rivers on this continent flow unimpeded. A few maps could have been clearer ( more contrasting color) but most all are great.....and many beautiful photos . My husband gave it a 5 star rating over all."
3,Not what I expected,"I expected this book to be about its title, but it was only half that. The other half was explaining geological techniques- something I couldn't have cared less about while I was reading this book. I was and am still interested in the geologic and evolutionary history of earth. When I bought this book that's what I thought I was getting. Instead, about half the pages were taken up with geologic tools, such as carbon dating. I wasn't interested in how you determined the age of a rock, but only the age of the rock and what that implied.Also, at the end (the last chapter) he talked about the disasters that are about to occur, unless all of our money is funnelled into geologists pockets, so they can tell us what to be afraid of.Overall, the book was okay because it delivered on at least part of what I wanted to know, but spent too much time on saying ""look at all the cool things I can do"". Just tell me about earth's history, not how you determined it."
3,library book?,It looks like this seller stole a library book and mailed it to me. this is kind of a joke as it still has the library codes on it. i suppose it could have been sold to him from another user though. good condition and came in good time
3,Somewhat less than 330 tips,"When the title says tips that is exactly what it means, this is a compendium of blurbs about elk hunting that range from one liners to several paragraphs. While this book has some interesting and useful information a lot of it is not detailed enough, and there is a lot of tongue in cheek for a book that is supposed to be serious. A little more editing to remove the filler would have been useful. For the price, its not too bad, but if you expect integrated information on elk hunting spend the extra money for one of the more in-depth books."
4,good tips over and over,"Over all this book has some very good tips but at the same time can be repetitive in contents. you will also have to use your judgement on what tips you want to try this season. Some are good, some are differnt, and some well you will just have to read the book. over all this book was a good read and I will try some of the new and interesting ways to hunt, track, and care for my game."
3,Tips and Tactics Only Average,"Elk Hunting Secrets offers more conflicting anecdotes than helpful suggestions. The stories and tips, while often amusing, seemed to conflict with each other more often than not and as such could leave the curious but unexperienced elk hunter scratching his head. My recommendation is: if you are an experienced elk hunter, you will find the stories and tips interesting, funny, and maybe from time to time, helpful. For the price, its not a bad little book. For the inexperienced hunter, look elsewhere before turning to this book. You may end up being more confused than enlightened.One afterthought - the tips for camp and horse care were for the most part very good. If you are the leader or host of a yearly elk camp, this book may have something for you."
2,Marginal,"Many of the tips in this book may be O.K for a begining hunter, but anyone who has spent very much time in the field, will not find many new ideas. I suppose any new idea may be helpful, but I was disappointed to only find a few."
1,If you do not know these Ideas by Heart Go home do not pass GO,"Now I know why you can no longer read a few of the pages that count rather than just the contents and such. The ones like "" Do not setup your camp in the middle of an elk bedding area."" ""Do not bugle and call to elk from your car."" ""Always put your stand or blind up several weeks ahead of time.""The whole book is just a collection of do this and do not do that. or this is my opinion.Now you know the rest of the story. This should be a $.99 kindle book.dray"
2,"good, not great","This album just takes you into a different landscape with each song. ""Remembrace""sounds majestic, ""Dust and Echoes"" is simply stunning. Alot of the music though is aranged alike, they start off slowly with a great crezendo at the end, sort of leaves you feeling like you know whats comimg. "" The End of the Beginning"" CD I think is their best stuff."
4,Post-rock finds another great band,"Though I'm a fan of other post-rock bands like Mogwai and Explosions In The Sky, I had never heard of the oddly-named God Is An Astronaut until they popped up on my last.fm radio. Thankfully they did, as I was quickly mesmerized by their sound, which clearly drew influences from the genre, but was unique at the same time. The first few songs, particularly the title track and ""Fragile"", are worth listening to several times in a row if need be. Though the album tapers off a bit at the end, this album is a definite keeper in the growing genre of post-rock."
5,I gotta have this one,"Ok, so I haven't heard the CD yet, but I saw them on their acoustic tour. It was right before Seasons came out, and at the show they had a deal that if you preordered the new cd, they gave you a poster and you could go back and meet them and they would sign it. My poster looks like the cover of Southside Doublewide. My friend convinced me to go to the show, and I was very skeptical. It was a really wonderful surprise. I really enjoyed the show. Sevendust are really great guys. They actually talked to us and didn't try to rush us through or anything. Lajon even asked me my name so he could sign the poster to me. I have nothing but respect for these guys and I catch them every time they come around. If you like a good mosh pit, go to a Sevendust show."
5,Great stuff!,"This is an all around great pickup. CD, DVD, & plenty of other junk for the sevendust fan. Notice I said fan. If you are an occasional sevenduster this isn't for you. If you are then you will be very pleased. Clint Lowery is a great musician and is more vocally talented then I thought. Lajon pours his soul into all the songs and the whole cd/dvd is a great experience."
5,New Idea,"This was a great idea by Sevendust to record a live acoustic concert and then release a CD/DVD combo package. The set also comes with 20 pictures of the band playing live as well as a guitar pick. As far as the music, Lajon is noticeably nervous at first but very quickly is back to form. I think this CD shows how talented Sevendust really is and I recommend it to all of their fans. Best songs- Xmas Day, Hurt, Angel's Son, and Black."
3,what happened to the 2 hours of dvd footage?,I picked this up today and it's great but I can't find anything on the DVD beside the acoustic performance. I've ready in many places that the DVD would have over 2 hours of bonus footage and features but they are not there.
5,Sevendust amazing,I have to tell you this is one of the greatest bands of all time and they never get enough credit this album is amazing seriously buy it.
3,False Advertising!,"I'm a little annoyed..... this did NOT come with the guitar pick OR the booklet like it was supposed to!!!However, this is a GREAT concert to watch."
2,Not worth the time....,"This album is bland, boring and a waste of time. Even more so than Seasons.Sevendust has always been a great band because they make HEAVY music with some good melody mixed in to make aggressive music thats interesting to boot. Recently the band seems to think that their radio-friendly melodies are on par with the likes of Prince or MJ though. I'm sorry, I love the band but when they drudge on for whole songs relying on nothing but their ""melodic-content"" it puts me to sleep. Its not particularly bad, its just not good. There's nothing exciting about it.So take all hint of heaviness away from the their songs they get twice as boring. There is nothing engaging about this CD. There's nothing origional about it. Its just not very good. Hopefully the band can get back to what they're good at, not what ""everyone"" likes them for. I'll be waiting...."
1,you must be joking,"This is just an atrocity..first godsmack and now this..First off, these guys haven't made a decent record in 6 years. Second, how are they gonna have a tribute to Johnny Cash using a song he covered in the last days of his life? They couldn't pick something HE wrote and maybe something that was relevant in Cash's own days like ""Ring of Fire"" or ""Native Son""? Apparently Sevendust doesn't know a whole lot of Cash, for the would neither use that particular song as a cover nor would they sound anything like they do. They should just save us all some time and go spit on his grave. What an insult."
5,Totaly Breathtaking and Amzingly Delivered,"This band has been my favorite since I can remember, I have not 1 bad thing to say think or write about them. Every cd of theirs is worth full price not matter what in my opinion. This album acoustic live is the most well thought, well written, and well performed album I ever heard. GET IT!"
4,Riviera Style - Yeah Baby!,"A fine installment in a fine series. The French and Italians had a unique take on the musical and cultural revolutions taking place in the U.S. and Great Britain in the 1960's. Less in need of a major overhaul in societal norms, they simply jumped on the musical bandwagon - style more than statement. By the end of the 60's, this had led to some wacky but insanely groovy music coming out of southern europe.This CD captures some classics. The sound ranges from Beatles influenced pop-rock, to kitchy Tom Jones-ish gems. Rather than attempt to describe the songs (or even identify the standouts), I'll simply say that this CD would provide the perfect soundtrack to a jet-set weekend on the Riviera. Bubbly, sunny, and a ton of fun. Buy it and recreate the swinging ambiance of the Amalfi coast in 1969... oh, check out the rest of the series too - guaranteed fun."
3,An Excellent Choice,"The book is well written and a great self help book.It is a complete picture from beginning to end , and takes you step by step with excellent explanations and procedures. A must for beginners and a compliment for craftmen."
4,Great collection,"This is a great collection of stories. I heard one read on the radio and immediately ordered it. The stories deal with the complexities of relationships, marriage, death, and much more."
3,"Small title, big order","This ""Gondoliers"" was one of my very first G&S; recordings. I paid I-don't-know-how-much for it, and it called up only 'modified rapture'. Yes, it was nice to have, but I can't say I enjoyed it much. The orchestra was particularly good - no discernable mistakes, the tempos were good and consistent, the soloists were very good. But the diction was very peculiar. In places it's so good that I hear other words instead of what they actually said. Or things that made no sense whatever. I just did not enjoy it.I might also point out an error in the booklet. Why is Casilda assigned to the last bit of the Act 1 Finale when she clearly has no reason to be there? I couldn't say if she was actually present on that track, but why was this mistake in the book?"
4,Never opened the book.,Got this for an MBA class and never really used it. Our professor wrote the book and so his lectures were enough.
3,i didn't received the book in expected time,"i ordered this book, paid extra to receive in a couple of days, and it took 2 weeks to arrive. i attempted to reach someone, and no one ever replied back to me."
5,A grand slam homerun for Randy & the Rainbows!,"No foul balls or strike outs here! This is Randy & the Rainbows at their best! This CD is very high energy and is loaded with great super fantastic songs. Vinny Carella and Jimmy Bense display their great talents as outstanding vocalists, while Mike Zero does super knockout lead vocal of the new version of Denise still with that classic Rainbows sound. This CD is very professionally done with a lot of work and attention done to detail and perfection. The melodies and harmonies are fantastic. Most highly recommend as an absolute must-buy!"
3,good but not packaged well,"These were good crackers. It was just what I was looking for. However, the entire amount was in one thin bag that was not properly sealed. I think they would have been freasher if the bag had a proper seal. I would have prefered several smaller bags, but I guess the large bag helped with the cost."
1,Incorrect Description,The item is listed as Blu-ray/DVD Combo. It is actually a Blu-ray and digital Combo. there is no DVD Version in this package. Calling Amazon to verify content is fruitless since they just replace the item with another of the same.
4,Wonderful Movie,"I truly enjoyed this movie. This movie was not what I expected. The story was good. I enjoyed the characters. I would recommend this movie to others. It had it sad parts, but overall it was upbeat"
2,Oh Please!,"This is absolutely absurd, it was true that Slumdog Millionaire was a good movie but people are getting hyped up on a movie that wasn't exceptional. It's sad yes but no where compared to movies like Benjamin Button, Frost/Nixon or even Doubt. Poor Oscar Choice this year.. (Just like they did with Crash)"
1,this must be the most overrated film of all times!!,"I'm not as much shocked by the Slumdog's thin/predictable story line, bad acting and cardboard cut-out characters, as much as I am with the success it did achieve. Good for the filmmakers..., but hey, you don't have to waste your time watching it."
2,Not as good as the hype,Another example of an over hyped movie. Not terribly original.I found myself bored most of the time. Certainly not worthy of any Oscars for film or acting.
3,Scratched disk,"Shipment was fast. However, the disk was scratched and the movie started skipping in 2 different parts when played. Tried to clean it but it still skipped..."
4,Slumdog Millionaire,"A poor kid (jamal malik) from the slums of mumbai, goes on the indian TV show 'Who wants to be a millionaire' and reunites with his beautiful, estranged childhood friend 'latika'... which meanders through his destiny-fueled, question-confirming life up until this point. Great movie. Just watdch it."
2,NOT feel good,Don't watch this expecting a feel good movie...it starts with child torture and blinding.Icouldn't watch any more but to be fair all my friends and family love it.Just be prepared.
3,Not Bad,"This was not a bad movie. The kids were great. I don't what it is that keeps me from saying the movie was great. I mean, there were great moments here and there, but I actually watched this movie in bits and pieces. I found myself needing a break now and then. Yeah, and of course it was a bit contrived, but the thing is it felt contrived. But still, it was not bad. The soundtrack is awesome."
2,"Good movie, Bad DVD","I saw this movie in the theatre, and I don't recall having such a hard time reading the subtitles.I'm not exaggerating when I say reading text in this movie is equivalent to reading 6-point font. Much of the 1st half of the movie uses subtitles and all of the gameshow questions are WAY too hard to read. Compounding the problem are the colored backgrounds on which the subtitles appear, some of which blend in with the background. Not to mention that you need to be a speed-reader to read all of the subtitles before they disappear from the screen.The story is great, the movie is great, but the makers of this DVD really dropped the ball. It's unfortunate. Not recommended."
1,WHAT?,"I am glad I did not spend one cent to watch this so at least I still have my money, but what about the 2 hours of my life that are gone forever? As the dance number like some whacked out version of HSM ends this abortion of a film I am left wondering, are the Oscars a rigged event or is this what is considered good filmaking these days? Don't get me wrong Danny Boyle was one of my all time favorites before this Indian version of a Regis game show wide awake nightmare, but seriously what did this film have to offer? Charachter development that had all the structure and depth of one of those God awful 90's mentos commercials. Seriously this is the year that you walk away from the hype, choose for yourself. If you would not normally pick up a movie about an Indian bum who has all the emotion of R2-D2 and wins on a game show, roll end credits with highly ridiculous dance number, then don't change your mind for the words BEST PICTURE."
1,I knew how it would end after 20 minutes.,"This movie was so predictable; I don't know why it had so much acclaim. First of all the subtitles were all over the screen and small. It was more violent than I expected. The acting was mediocre at best; even the ""love"" aspect wasn't believable. Very disappointing, sure glad I rented it for five dollars because that's how much you'll see these in a mark down bin very soon."
1,Bad product,"The initial DVD delivered was a bad product, and was replaced by Amazon the following week."
1,YUCK!,"This movie is disgusting, not uplifting. Every adult character is a brutal stereotype, the kids are all hyperactive acting, and the protagonist just stares with a blank look on his face the whole time. I hated it."
1,"A ""Feel Good"" Movie, Are you Kidding Me????","At least two times I heard the media refer to this at a feel good movie. This movie made me feel terrible. The only think that made me feel good was that the characters survived this movie, and it was finally over. I would have felt good if the character won the money and then did something great with it to change the slums. All the characters, save one, were black and white. As opposed to say, Gran Torino, the movie I think should have won, which had characters that were black, white,grey, good, bad, and changeable. Really depressing to me is that nothing has changed in the slums of Bombay(now Mumbai) since I was there 40 years ago, and nothing will until the culture changes. If you want to see how the people have survived with dignity and compassion those forty years watch a real movie live Patrick Swayze's City of Joy!"
1,SLUMDOG: DISAPPOINTING DVD VERSION!,"Having missed the theatrical release, I purchased a copy of Slumdog from the local Walmart on Tuesday, 31st March and watched the movie in the same evening. Sadly all the special features were missing on the dvd, one of the main reasons for my buying it to see old Bomaby again. If the blog on dvd tells the consumers that there are special features, they should have been there. In this case, evidently the first major error in dvd history, FOX used the greed bait, just like the GM and AIG. We all know what happened to them. I think it is the responsibility of FOX to send a free dvd to all who purchased the defective version.I took mine back for a refund."
2,Not The Greatest,"I was really suprised that this movie won the Academy Award for best picture..After watching Slumdog just recently & comparing it to the other nominated movies this year that i did see like The Reader & Milk,Slumdog was extremely overated.I believe that the Academy got it wrong this time,they gave in to all the hype.To me the story of slumdog is a good story about the human condition in India but falls short of a classic movie that i would want to see again."
4,Wonderful Film,Slumdog millionaire was a wonderful film that not only portrayed Indian life but also was an incredible portrait of love that can last a lifetime. I knew that this film won the Oscar and many other awards but didn't know much about the plot. It essentially is the love story of two young people and how their lives separate them and bring them back together.The way this film is shot is definately unique. The violence and brutality in the movie don't quite seem as realistic as a typical action/drama movie. I believe this makes it slightly easier to watch for those that have trouble watching those types of films. Overall this movie was solid. I am not enamored enough to give it 5 stars but I would recommend it to anybody interested.
4,"Great In Many Ways, But A Bit Disjointed","This is masterfully filmed and acted but I had a bit of difficulty following the story in the beginning. Overall, I have to grudgingly admit that it probably does deserve all the accolades it received, but overall it just didn't do it for me. I have to say that the slims of India make East LA look like Beverly Hills! This film may have put India in the map in the American film world, but I don't think I'm quite ready to take a vacation there."
4,A Gem Worth Investing In,"Danny Boyle's multi-oscar winning film hits the shelves on DVD, but is it worth a look, given all the hype ?? The answer is 'absolutely yes'. Set in Mumbai, it follows a contestant Jamil on the Indian version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire', where each answer depicts a stage in his life that is both harrowing and uplifting. It's a tale of poverty, family destruction and of course undying love. This is a movie that tugs at the heart-strings and although not gripping, it is compulsive viewing. Dev Patel is fantastic as Jamil, but that said, all of the acting is of a very high standard. Totally believable, thoroughly engaging and a unique must-see movie."
1,Full of gratuitous violence---NO THANKS!,"I can't believe the positive reviews. This movie was horrifying, I could not watch past the first half hour. It makes me very sad for the human race that this movie is so well-received."
1,nothing great about this movie...,nothing great about this movie...its an average movie... i wonder how could it worth Oscar and Golden Globe. It can not come close to the past winners like Gladiator/Beautiful mind/Lord of the rings/million dollar baby/crash/departed.
2,This is Best Picture? Worst Oscars Ever...,"The film starts off well enough, when they were kids in the slums. In particular were some scenes on an Indian train that reminded me of some scenes in Gandhi. Seeing the evil people using kids to beg on the street really hit home with me, it's everywhere in China. And it's sick. There were also some good, funny moments during the interrogation scenes when Jamal stood up to his tormenters.But I don't think the romance worked at all. The relationship with his brother didn't feel real at all either, it felt very tacked on. And I found it hard to care about the main character, especially because he spends half his screen time mute, staring into space.Will he win the money and the girl or lose both. I didn't care at all one way or the other. I didn't find much fun in the film, and there's absolutely nothing there to think about.It really is the worst Oscars ever."
3,Bogus special features,"Do not buy this DVD if you are interested in the special features listed on the box and at the Amazon site. This DVD does not contain the making of, the deleted scenes or the audio commentary. The special features contain only trailers for 4 other movies. The movie is great, but the main reason I bought the DVD was to watch the making of. This false advertisement was a complete disappointment."
5,Slumdog Millionaire,"I had no idea what this DVD was when I ordered it, but it was recommended by a friend. Glad he did! You delivery service from Amazon was great as usual. Thanks."
5,Not a Bollywood movie,"Slumdog Millionaire is more than just a story of love, loss and betrayal or a catchy song. The images of Mumbai (formerly Bombay) are very powerful, raw and real; sometimes too real for people to see, and may make people feel uncomfortable, but that's life in India. As someone who has been there, I have seen the beauty and the wealth, the crippled and the poor and the generosity of people far less fortunate than me."
3,Beautiful story but very graphic,"This is one of those movies where I'm not sure I'm glad if I watched it or not.. At one point I almost turned it off because of the horrifying things they do to the children in the movie. I did think there was a beautiful story within the plot that was quite touching. I can see what all the hype was about. But if I had known the horrors that lied within, I probably wouldn't have watched it at all. I knew it would be about gritty street life in India. But I guess I just wasn't prepared for the graphic things that happened to the children. I am seriously haunted by some of those images & it greatly disturbed & saddened me. So if you decide to watch - just be prepared for that."
5,There is a reason it won the Oscar.,"And that's because it's so good! I loved this movie, though I did find it a bit depressing. It's got a great backstory and the way the filmmakers tied in the stories was nothing short of brillant. It was moving, sometimes funny and sometimes sad, everything an Oscar winner is. I hope to read the book,Slumdog Millionaire: A Novelsoon."
4,Excellent movie. Good quality,"SlumDog, an uplifting story about a poor boy's life and his quest to claim his destiny. The blu-Ray is excellent quality and well worth the money spent. I do not have the DVD to compare it to, but it has plenty of features and the digital copy download is also a nice bonus. The digital copy is compatible with both PCs and Macs."
4,Great movie..,Great movie. Most people I know shy from foreign films. This should be their first exception. Played great as advertised. Very easy on screen transaction after simpla account set up. Good communication. Will use again.
4,Awesome story,This movie is probably one of the best stories I have ever seen. I can't watch it too much because its not that type if movie for me but I think it's powerful!
3,Decent Movie - Not as great as everyone says it is,"I just saw this movie for the first time. I thought it was just OK. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. It's definitely not a movie that I ever foresee myself watching again. The definition of 3 stars."
5,Slumdog Millionaire DVD,This movie was awesome. I LOVE it and would watch it everyday if I had the time. This is a TRUE love story to me. Not Curious Case of Benjamin Button (BORING). Give it a try. I believe you will not be disappointed.
3,"Entertaining, but Oscar's ""Best Picture""??? Ya gotta be kidding.","No doubt, this movie is entertaining, but is it an Academy Award winner for Best Picture? The acting is a bit stiff, the story is Ok, the cinematography is amateurish.The story is very linear and straight forward....no surprises really.It just seems that this film kinda went ""viral"" on the Academy and they jumped on the bandwagon and decided to purge themselves of guilt towards those that are impoverished and award this movie Best Picture. On the other hand, there wasn't that much to choose from in 2008."
3,"A good film, that became overrated","This past awards season left a bad taste in my mouth, when every honor went to ""Slumdog Millionaire"" as the year's best. Don't get me wrong its a good film, that is very enjoyable. But it is just a good film not a great one, and it became very overrated like last year's ""Juno"". I understand why people love this film so much, it's a feel good movie about rooting for the underdog to succeed and be with his true love. It's not a bad film, it's just if you are going to reward films based on excellence. Then I think their were certainly better films then ""Slumdog Millionaire""."
2,"Over 2 hours of pure HELL,but PAY the kids that were in the film!!","This is the MOVIE everyone was talking about?This is the MOVIE that won all the Awards?The 2 young stars of the film are great,and the girl is BEUTIFULL,but thats it.The fast cut editing,the predictable story line just doesn't get it.""Slumdog Millionaire is over 2 hours of pure hell,but at least PAY the kids that were in the film.The producers made millions,and the young children who made this money for you are starving ."
1,Non-functional DVD,"I love this movie, but I bought a copy from Amazon and it wouldn't work in multiple DVD players. I exchanged it for another copy from Amazon and had the same problem. I ended up buying a used copy from Blockbuster and it was fine. Fortunately, Amazon has a great return policy. I've never had a problem with Amazon before and haven't since, but I think this was a bad batch of movies."
1,Cannot believe this movies got so much hype,"As an Indian I was appaled by the movie . It is quiet unrealistic and thestory shows a India which does not really exist .In the end it was just slum porn . Long shots of pimping the third world poverty and filth made for thewesten masses , who seemed to have lapped it up with 8 oscars et al."
1,No special features,"The movie is good, but DVD is not.These is no special feature as itsaid on the box. Don't buy thisitem through Amazon.com"
1,TERRIBLE!,"Expecting a feel good movie I was disgusted to see a child being tortured early in the movie. At that point I was going to stop watching it but instead made the mistake of watching the whole thing: Boy was I dissapointed. How this repulsive movie made the best movie of the year I don't know because there were much better movies which well deserve best movie of the year like ""W."" for example. Don't waste your time with this BIG letdown!"
1,Nothing great......,"I don't know why suddenly a group of Americans suddenly recommended this movie. This movie has nothing great. The story is predictable. The correct answers given in the contest was totally not acceptable. The guy goes to the police station between the shows and gets massive beating and the slums suddenly speak very good english etc etc. The music is also very average.If this movie gets oscar, I ask the judges to go and watch only movies made in Mumbai. Translate all the Indian movies and start giving them Oscars. Slumdog is nothing compared to movies made in Mumbai. Totally dissapointed to see oscars selection."
4,Not what I expected,"This movie left me filled with turmoil. I expected a feel good type of movie about a young impoverished Indian who wins it big and immediately improves his life. That is not necessarily what I got.I did not expect the violence and utter desperation of these characters. It is a heart wrenching story, but also a beautiful love story. I am glad they ended the movie on a happy note. It was certainly well acted."
1,Not worth Watching,This movie does not show the India I have seen 25 years. Its disturbing and dont recommend seeing this movie.The girl coming and joining the hero at the end is to cinematic. I dont think the movie deserves Oscar.
4,Slumdog Millionaire,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this movie but it runs the gamut of emotions. A poor boy from the slums of India manages to get onto a trivia game show just like ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" with Howie Mandel. As he gets closer and closer to the multi-million jackpot we see his life played out before us. He has endured many things since childhood, mostly torment including his mothers death. The one light of his life is a girl he met when he was young. Most of the movie reflects his trying to track her down after their separation. Good drama and good production. Good quality DVD with a few features. Decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catchCave of the Yellow Dog.CA Luster"
3,"Great idea for a movie, but somewhat disapppointing for me.","This was a great premise for a movie, however, after a short while the movie seemed to repeat the same theme --- boy gets answer right, based on an experience he previously had. Doesn't seem possible that someone who was that poor could have had that many experiences and would be the exact answer to a question asked on a game show. He didn't seem any worse for wear after he was treated so harshly when he was on the program the next time. All in all, I had expected a much better movie based on all I had heard about it."
3,Slumdog Worth Name,"I heard nothing but raves for this movie, so for such a cheap price I decided to buy it (it would've been the same cost as renting!). However, I didn't think it was worth the hype. I thought the movie kind of dragged and wasn't as meaningful as I was led to believe. It's not overwhelmingly entertaining, but if you're curious about the hype it is a somewhat decent flick; just be sure not to spend too much because this isn't one you'll watch over and over!"
2,Too Exaggerated to be Believable,"The fact that soo much of the movie is exaggerated ruined it for me. The fact that soo many bad things happened to one small child was totally unbelievable.Just because a movie is ""cultural"" and it has a song in it does not necessarily make it good.I actually decided to go to the slums of Mumbai to see if this movie is actually realistic (wanted to volunteer). The people living in the slums of Mumbai are completely different from what is shown in the movie. I noticed that people had color TVs in their homes, stereo systems, running water, etc. And they were all happy to be living there as a community.This movie was too fake to be appreciated. Some scenes are totally disturbing and unnecessary (and unreal)."
3,Not deserving the Oscar,"Interesting telling of a story about a child of poverty in India who beomes a millionaire and wins the love of his life to boot. Entertaining? Yes Worth an Oscar and all the other awards? Absolutly not. ""Doubt"", ""Milk"", and ""The Reader"" were all much better films. Just as ""Brokeback Mountain"" lost to ""Crash"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"" lost to ""Shakespeare in Love"", somebody was smoking something when they voted on this one."
2,Very Poor Movie if You've Already Read the Book,"Not to sound cliche, but I probably would have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't read the book (which is terrific). I think the movie mirrors some of the violence/horror of the book. However, the situations presented in the movie are TOTALLY different than the book and the characters portrayed in the movie are much less compelling."
2,Blu-ray version ... no control for about 20 minutes of wasted time,"The movie was okay, but I doublt if I will watch it again.Note that if you plan on watching this movie say after dinner or whatever, be sure to start the movie BEFORE you start to eat.I have the blu-ray version and you are forced to watch about 20 minutes of movie reviews WITHOUT fast forward or remote control jump to disk menu.That's crazy. Can you imagine watching half of the movie and you lose power for a minute. There is no way to restart the movie without sitting thru those first 20 minutes LOCKED OUT of video control.This is for the blu-ray version ... could be the std version has a way of getting to the main menu using a remote button."
5,"Realistic, energetic and witty movie","I can't add anything to what has been said already. I just wanted to add another 5 star rating to a great movie. No movie is perfect, and this movie obviously does have flaws but as a whole it's one well presented package. You would probably understand it much better if you have traveled to that part of the world. If not you can watch this movie and learn a little bit about the how the rest of the world is living their day to day lives."
2,A nice film but I wouldn't call it Oscar worthy,"Let's admit it: if it wasn't for all the hype that surrounded this film until the Oscars, no one would have seen it. While it certainly has an interesting storyline, it's not a film that I particularly remember long after I left the cinema. Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto do a nice job but the film only gets interesting (for me anyway) late in the second half. A bad film? No, far from it. Oscar-worthy? That's debatable especially since Frost/Nixon did a much better job conveying to the viewer the affect of the Richard Nixon years. This film will inspire debates for years to come on whether it was political liberal pandering or good storytelling that garnered awards. Still, I urge people to see the movie and judge for themselves. It's worth a rental anyway."
5,Excellent,"There are some good books and movies starting to come out of India. If you likedSlumdog, I think you will certainly like the book : The White Tiger; i suggest theaudiobook version, it follows a similar theme as Slumdog. A beggar from the Darkness of India becomes a driver for a rich man whom he eventually kills. Sad and funny at the same time."
4,Blu-Ray Review,"Amazon is becoming more and more incompetent. They only post my reviews when they feel like it.Anyhow, Slumdog was better than I expected it to be and I liked it better than the Wrestler."
5,"Great film, uplifting story, overall amazing film!",I watch alot of movies but somehow this one had slipped under my radar until an Indian American friend recommended it. Since that day I've seen the movie 3 times in theaters (sure it was on dates but still!) I can't wait to get my blue ray copy so I can experience the wonderful cinematography and music in high def. The movie deserves all the accolades it has received and it is a very fun and uplifting film which is rare for Best Picture winners at the Oscars. I cannot recommend this film highly enough!
2,Too graphic for me,"I had high hopes after seeing the wonderful reviews. But, I couldn't get even a third of the way through the movie. The scenes of his early life were too brutal, too graphic. When it came to blinding the little child with acid, I had to turn it off. The memories of those images are still with me."
5,Who'd Believe It? A Real Life HERO!!!,"There are many reviews that cover the plotline. Every other review I read expressed the same feelings that I had about the impossible poverty, depressed living levels and the expectations of people who feel there is no future for them or their children.How wonderful it was to watch this young man break the steriotype and come through the disbelief of the show producers and police. Still, with all the negativity around him, our Hero comes through like the Champion he is in life. A perfect role model for his peers and for everyone.Want to laugh? Want a cry or two? Need to feel like we should all have hope? This film will give you all thse and more.I am almost speechless."
5,"Excellent story, excellent service!","I will purchase movies from this seller again! Also, Slumdog Millionaire is an interesting title but explains itself quickly in the movie. I've shared it with friends and family and they all loved it! Enjoy!"
5,Great Movie and story line,Thiss is a must have DVD for your collection. Especially since it's a fim festival movie. Most great moives come the various festival with great review. I loved it and have watch it at east 2X. Check it out..... I'm pretty sure you'll love it as much as I do.
4,A Glimpse of Another Society,"I cannot say that I ejoyed this film but I thought it was very good and allowed me to view how another society under a caste system treated its people in an American made media situation. It also caused me to reflect upon the virtues of the American way of life and to measure its imperfections against another countries way of life. The value for me in watching this movie was to remind me of how well we treat one another in America compared to a relatively poor country like India where the accepted behavior is to treat those of a lower class with distain and unworthiness. I could say much more about this film, but I think I have expressed its impact upon me."
1,Slumdog Millionaire,"CD is in very poor condition. Makes so much noise, you cannot hear the movie. Sounds like someone might have tried to record over it."
1,I hade a panic attack after watching for 20mn!!!!,"This is a horrifying movie, crual and inhuman. I couldn't take one more horror scene after watching the kid beeing removed his eyes....I had a panic attack and was crying and screeming. My husband shut the tv down, to try to confort me. Myyyyyyy god, this movie should be rated as a horror movie. I wich I never came a cross it...please stay away, especialy if you are a sensitive person..."
1,Muslim bias in a Hindu country?,"The movie showed Hindus attacking and killing Muslims in the ghetto. One person was the mother of the main character. The scene is particularly brutal.I cant help but to feel there is some lopsided bias in this movie? Perhaps a favor for bin Laden?If anyone knows about Indian history, they should surely know that it has been the Muslims that have been the most aggressive against Hindus for centuries! CENTURIES!Muslims back in the 1400s-1700s were vicious animals towards Hindus. They destroyed some beautiful cities : Hampi! Look it up.The Hindus were never militaristic like the Muslims and the Muslims have been instigate most of the aggression recently as well. ie we dont see Hindu terrorists going into Pakistan to bomb people.I see this movie as an insult to Hindus and I dont appreciate it."
1,"awful, why can't you see past the hype","Generic film with generic plot elements and horrible acting. Fight the power, don't watch this film. The Academy has made many, many big mistakes. Remember Pulp Fiction? Lost the Academy Award to Forrest Gump, stand up for movies of true quality and lasting appeal."
1,terrible movie,this only got best picture to attract indian dollars and to allow us more access to their audience. because there aren't any other explanations.
3,6pc Hook Bar Set,"The hook bar set was exactly what I expected for the low cost. The tapering on the line up end of the bars was very out of round and the 12"" pinch bar was bent in the middle but the set will still do what I need it to."
3,"New tracks good, old tracks - a shame","If the author of the album had come up with an entirely new album I would rate this one or two stars higher than I have. The fact is that three of the tracks on this album are the same as three tracks from the previous album, ""Ladderdown"" - they are simply renamed. It is possible that there are very, very subtle differences in length or mixing, but to my trained ear I could not hear a difference.It is for that reason that what could've been a 4 or 5, becomes a 3.A pity, given that the rest of the album stands up on it's own quite well. But the duplicity of adding old tracks and just renaming them annoys me.Other than that, a fine piece of ambient work, and if you are not in possession of the author's previous album, a beautiful introduction to the world of Drifting in Silence."
5,One of the Best Wilderness Books Ever,"Wolves Bears and Bighorns is a real page turner. The author was a great writer, and his photographs are amazing. The work was all done alone, on foot, with 1960s equipment. Yet it reaches the level of photographic excellence we now see with big budget film productions like ""Planet Earth"". The book tells great stories of the author's adventures, and it shows wildlife living free in unspoiled habitats and beautiful landscapes."
3,"great but, shoddy cut","This is a gorgeous ankle boot, made with fine details. Wonderful gripping, non-skid heel. I could not ask for better materials or workman ship. HOWEVER, be warned. For some reason the vamp of the book is cut way too tight. I have a high arch and the vamp on this book was just too tight. I even bought them a 1/2 too large to allow for winter socks, so imagine my shock when I had to FIGHT to get them on even with hose!. The were roomy in length, fine in the heel, just the vamp is way too tight. Even allowing for leather boots to loosen, it's still cut all wrong."
5,Fantastic Skill,"I completely agree with Cesar Millan, my dogs are pretty well behaved, but trying some of his techniques really made a different immediately. I completely recommend this product to anyone. And completely disagree with the first review, wherein you have to reward your dog for everything, they should listen to you because you love them and want the best for them not because you will reward them with something. You should reward them for tricks, not for well-being and obedience."
4,I disagree with the first reviewer.,"I think Cesar Millan is terrific. I've found other dog trainers that I have seen, aren't that great. Cesar knows where I come from. I have a nine year old female Jack Russsell mix. She's fear aggressive, and difficult walking on leash. I used his methods, and they seem to help. It beats yelling at the poor thing. I disagree with the first review who has criticized Cesar's methods. I found that my Coco, is getting better and she still loves me. She still needs work, but I feel she's come along way. She's better with strangers that come into the house. Thank you Cesar. Coco and I thank you. Lauren and Coco. Be calm and submissive."
4,Cesar,"Cesar Millan is my hero!!!! I love watching the shows and bought this DVD for my husband since he has a new puppy that he takes on the road with him. For some reason I thought there would be many more shows on the DVD but now I see that you can buy a whole 'season' which probably has more shows than just volume 1 or 2 have. Cesar just uses common sense and that is what I love about him!!! It is almost like parenting, but he reminds us that dogs are 'pack' animals and have dog mentality and how we are to be the leader of the pack to get respect. I also bought one of his books and just think this man 'knows'. It is evident in how quick he can get the respect as leader when working with the dogs."
1,Not enough Information 4,"We returned this item. We had already ordered the complete 1st and 2nd Seasons. This DVD was full of Highlights of the 1st Season. Had we known this we would have spared Amazon the shipping costs both ways. As far as Cesar Millan is concerned, he is amazing. I would recommend thisseries to anyone who dosen't want to order the complete series."
5,Cesar Millan is the BEST!,Cesar Millan is the best at teaching people to train their dogs and be able to co-exist without a lot of drama and stress for both you and your dog! He has a very calm approach to teaching and his lessons really work! Your dog will love you for using Cesar's methods of training! A great video to understand dog behavior!
3,Cesar's Methods,"Those persons who have watched the National Geographic programs featuring Cesar Millan, those that have read his books, have varied ideas regarding his ""training"" techniques. The man does NOT claim to be a ""dog trainer""!From my experience, I have found that the people who 'get it', understand that he is rehabing dangerous dogs on the brink of being put to sleep. The methods he uses are for dogs whose days are down to zero. He features really bad dogs not seen or likely to be seen in any public training class or doggie day care center. Understanding that this is behavior which is NOT for John Q. Public to deal with. However, John Q. Public does need to be able to recognize a dog whose behavior is dangerous. This book will help, hopefully, to prevent dogs and their owners from getting into serious behavior problems leading to a serious combative incident and to seek help before that level is reached."
1,My Expert Completely Disagrees With This Person!!!!,"After taking my dog to a true dog behaviorist, he told me thatCesar's ""style"" is something I should not adopt. His ""one size fits all...gotta show 'em who's boss"" mantra is completely wrong.. My dog behaviorist is renowned in this part of the country and gives seminars on dog behavior in Japan, as well. He also heads the training for dogs who are taken into our local hospitals. I trust him completely... so I definitely question now what Cesar the ""dog whisperer"" has to offer. The person I am working with operates solely on the ""reward"" system."
5,Fantastic Details on this model,"I purchased this kit in the hobby store recently, the cost is comparable to the Amazon cost with shipping. This is an amazing kit, considering that model kits of any early Cougar are difficult to come by let alone the 67-68 body style. The bonus is in the box art, which is really the reason to buy this kit. Both the outer and inner box are detailed with as-built details of the kit car and pics of the original Funny Car Cougar. More pics of the assembled model and details from the guy who compiled the decals can be found on the net by looking up Sven's World of Wheels, as annotated on the box bottom. I highly recommend this kit to any hobbiest looking to break away from the box store models that can be found everywhere."
3,A Personal Look at the Thoughts and Struggles of a Counselor,"Although I have not read the entire book, what I have read is fascinating to me. There are some very good ideas here, i.e. for time management, dealing with certain situations, etc. I was reminded of many things that I did growing up, and I see my dear departed father coming through the author's writing. Dear author, I will admit right here and now that I am your younger brother. You are welcome at my house any time, and I wish you would visit, I honestly and truly miss you, and you do not have to believe what I do, I love you and respect you as you are. I also want you to get to know my kids (and they want to know you), and you have a lot in common with my wife whom you met. Please call me (collect if you want) at 703-878-8952. I hope to hear from you soon."
2,:(,"I was not completely thrilled with this DVD. I had high expectations from the reviews I read, however it was not at all what I had expected. She gave very little instruction as she was teaching the combination, I was concentrating on one move and she slipped in another before I knew it. It is a good reference dvd but not good for instructional."
5,Lots of fun in the bathroom,"If you're looking for a fun little bathroom, this is it. The toilet seat lifts up, the medicine cabinet opens to reveal an assortment of items on the shelves (sticker). The cabinet below the sink also opens. It comes with a potty chair that also has a lid that opens. And the claw-footed tub with a hand-held shower head is cute. It's great fun for kids who are learning about brushing their tooth, bathing, and using the potty."
3,Thought It'd Be Fun...,"We bought our daughter the bathroom set for her doll house. I thought she'd be thrilled, but has only played with it a couple times, and ignores it when she plays! I don't know if your child would react the same, but hey, the dollhouse still needs a bathroom. ;)Good thing the pieces snap back into place for the potty and mirror area."
5,Great Health Information,This video gave me great health information. Dr. Maloof simplifies health and gives you tips to implement immediately into your daily life. I love her approach and have already been doing many of the items she recommends. It has improved my life for the better. I highly recommend this video to anyone looking to improve their life and health.
5,An important reminder of why we must keep learning.,"A reviewer on these pages asked ""is objectivity so necessary a criteria when researching paranormal phenomena?"" I suppose if one is not interested in such research having any bearing on the progress of knowledge, poetic musings will suffice. But to those who want to pursue an understanding of the nature of the mind, or the nature of anything, for that matter, Professor Braude is an inspiration. There are no answers here, to be sure, except to the question: Is it worthwhile to closely examine what we call, for lack of a better word, reality? As Professor Braude notes, the cases he examines are more than anything ""humbling reminders that there's much still to learn."" But Braude leads the way in refusing to dismiss what he cannot refute and in daring to consider what he cannot prove. A welcome change from the arrogance that plagues so much of what passes for science in this age of fear."
3,Good quality and semi-enjoyable,This book was good quality and was semi enjoyable for a textbook. Much better than the other required reading for sure... I liked the parts that talked about the certain cases.
2,Not what I expected,"Nice packaging, but I was expecting more than the very basic CD within. Good to review your physics, but it doesn't live up to the claim : ""Compared to reading a traditional physics textbook, PhysicsTutor Excalibur is a much more efficient and effective way to learn physics."" Still, what should I have expected at this price."
5,College was the first time I'd EVER had physics. This was EXTREMELY useful.,"Our PhysicsTutor Excalibur software includes physics tutorials in each of the following 20 subject areas:1. Displacement, Velocity & Acceleration2. Vectors & Projectile Motion3. Forces & Friction4. Energy5. Momentum6. Circular Motion & Gravitation7. Rotational Motion8. Harmonic Motion9. Waves10. Thermodynamics11. Electric Charge & Electric Fields12. Electric Circuits13. Magnetism14. Electromagnetism15. Light16. Lenses & Mirrors17. Physical Optics18. Relativity19. Quantum Physics20. Particle Physics (The Standard Model)"
2,Book with Solutions Manual is Better,"I am a senior in college, and like a lot of people I put off the Physics requirements until the very end. I have found it very difficult to keep myself interested in the course, because the homework assignments are so long and tedious. So, I purchased Excalibur hoping it would be entertaining while teaching me Physics at the same time. Well, it's not very entertaining and I find it very difficult to actually learn Physics from it. The program is good at covering the basic concepts, so you understand the rules being applied. As far as working with the Math, it is extremely lacking. If you are like me and get the general concepts, but have problems applying the math, then, this disc is not for you. Pencil, paper, a textbook, and maybe a solutions manual to verify you are headed in the right direction, are much more effective study tools."
2,Not worth the money,You can find practice problems like these on-line for free without spending money. Not very interactive it is more like a physics book on the computer. The so called tutorials are just explanations on how to solve a problem that it gives you not the concept.
5,This is fascinating!!!,"I am currently taking Physics at my school in New York. First time, I was not completely engaged in using this tutor. As the course gets harder, I start to use the physics excalibur to improve my skill and grasp a better understanding. This tutor really helped me a lot and i get the confidence in solving physics problems. The specific details and an understandable explanation of physics really taught me a lot to improve my skill. I really recommend you this perfect tutor if you want to be a physics master!!!!!"
5,Thank You PhysicsTutor!,"This product saved my grade in not only physics, but my entire GPA as well. Being a straight A student, I was surprised by the difficulty of physics. I needed a tutor, but I didn't want to pay hundreds of dollars for one. Then I found PhysicsTutor and I knew that I was saved. Relatively inexpensive, plenty of practice problems and examples, and full year exams to help me prepare for my upcoming finals...what more could you ask for. Thank you PhysicsTutor Excalibur for leading me on my way to success in physics."
2,Not as described,"This sweater rack is not as described by the seller nor as pictured. Seller states the size is 28 x 29. It is actually 27 x 27 as stated on the box it comes in. It does not have a center support or the cross braces as shown in the photo. It does not have a hook to hang it by as indicated by the seller in the description. If the seller can't get the description of a simple sweater rack right, I wouldn't trust any description from this outfit."
3,cheap but not very goog,"The racks are useful, but they are not very resistant, the legs easily fall apart, and the net to hold the sweaters is very loose, you can stack them but the structure is weak."
1,Not as advertised,"I am very disappointed by the quality of this sweater rack. The netting, which is attached to the rack by a loop at each corner, does not stretch tightly across the frame. This makes it inadequate for anything other than extremely lightweight items. Also, the hook for hanging the rack, as shown in the instructions illustration, was not included.Since the cellophane packaging had to be ripped in order to open the rack, I am assuming I cannot return it. I'll need to check on this with Amazon.I have just purchased two stackable sweater racks from Bed Bath and Beyond (from their 3B Livesmart line). Although they can't be folded for easy storage, they are excellent - sturdy and suitable for even a very heavy sweater."
2,Broken,"Gave these to my daughter and when she opened them, there was a label on it broken. A part was missing but she decided to keep them anyway."
3,Good but fragile,"Works, but look out for the pins in the CF slot. On my camera the slot for the CF card is long, making the CF card almost disappear upon insertion. This means that when the card is inserted, it is held very well in the correct orientation (it is straight) for the pins that it must mate with. The Verbatim reader, however, is very shallow. This means that there is play, or slop, in the card as it is being inserted which can catch the pins incorrectly, either bending them or hitting them. I did the latter once and almost gave it a push which would have wrecked the reader. The pins had become bent and I had to take a knife and carefully straighten them out. I now have no problem with this reader as I treat it like glass. If you do too it will work for you. Manhandle it at all, and it will turn on you.Oh, and it really does take microdrives (some readers that claim this really do not)."
1,Verbatim 15 in 1 Universal Card Reader is poorly designed.,This device only functioned a few times before several of the CompactFlash pins failed to go into the card and bent over. I have a RCA Lyra RD2209 MP3 player and the card slot on this device has never had this problem. The main reason I purchased this item was to read CompactFlash cards for use in my MP3 player.
1,Disgusting,"This is disgusting. I am shocked at how offensive, crude, and inappropriate this game is. I consider it an atrocity. As a Native American woman who dances at contemporary pow wows, I find this ridiculously gross and disturbing. I hope that no one needs explanation as to why I am beyond offended."
1,brad saunders,BE WARNED!!!THE ITEM CODE ON THIS IS 1081173 AND ARE ADVERTISED TOGETHER FOR $9.85-$11-16(prices vary?)i paid $23 on the same site for the same item code 1081173??this is the price for item code 1081172.this item and their prices are totally screwed up!!!!
5,very easy read,"I loved this book. I am a new psychology PhD looking to get into web usability consulting and this book was perfect for me. I have not read other books on the topic but i can say that I am glad I found this one. It was a very easy read, and i really learned a lot. I like how it takes a psychological viewpoint much of the time. I also really like how he sets you up 100% to be a usability tester. He tells you everything you need to know from A-Z with very little budget. He is also very generous giving away all his secrets and a CD rom that has all sorts of pre-made forms to get you started (powerpoint presentation on usability to show clients, informed consent forms for experimental participants etc...). Now I feel i am ready to read something more technical."
2,Academic in the worst sense.,"The author states that the book was created as a text for his class and it certainly reads like a textbook. For a book that is about usability, the text is almost unreadably tedious at times. (e.g. ""...the first step toward Web site usability is to figure out the main goals of your Web site. For labeling purposes we will call these 'goals of the purpose.'"") Each of the points in the book is better made and illustrated in other texts (Krug - ""Don't Make Me Think"" is good). The attempts to lighten the subject with gratuitous cartoons and humor were more irritating than amusing."
5,Read this one--if you dare,"It's about time someone wrote a searing, achingly honest novel on the last of our societal taboos. This is a liberating book that in just 50,000 words takes us through a lifetime of experiences. An absolute must read."
5,Banned Novel a New Classic,"Banned in California schools because ultra-conservative parents are afraid of having their children discuss its marginally erotic contents, this novel deserves to be read and re-read. One way I evaluate the value of a book is by its ability to tolerate multiple readings. This one does--for any one serious about discovering childhood's unspoken secrets or serious about literature that dares to shed light on areas where fiction has not previously been permitted to go."
5,Intimate Secrets of Childhood Revealed at Last,"This book boldly leaps into the heart of childhood secrets that the culture tells as are taboo, untouchable. Childhood is the time of grave danger and unthinkable exploration; anything is possible, including sex. This book explores these ideas in an extraordinarily direct and honest manner. It is indispensible and should be #1 on everyone's bestseller list."
5,jade pendant,The jade and mother of pearl pendant was of very good quality and my mother loved it. The item was shipped very fast.
4,Take a trip to Balfurin castle.,Autumn in Scotland by Karen Ranney was interesting story based in Scotland in 1833. Charlotte travels to Scotland searching for her missing husband. She decided to start a school for young ladies as her husband home 'Balfurin Castel' and plans to file for divorce. After five years her husband returns or is it her husband. A nice mix of mystery and romance. If you enjoy this genre I would also suggest How to Abduct a Highland Lord by Karen Hawkins and Secrets of a Duchess by Kaitlin O'Riley.
4,You've been in medicine how long?,"and you haven't used this book yet? A comprehensive guide to treatment of poisons, toxins and many other agents. Only four stars because it hasn't been updated in so long. New edition is due any day now!"
3,Worthwhile but not impressive,"Interesting but disjointed story, not really very well written. Too heavy-handed with the God stuff. I'm not convinced that she has gained much insight through her journey; just learned to take her medication. Displays the manic mind quite effectively."
3,your Brother and Attention points- The soultion,"Patty, Drugs and espically LSD losen or allow the attention points to float -These attention points are briefly hinted at inCarlos Castanada -Dreaming occures due to fluctiations in the attention points. all the attention points are accuretly docummented in the Jewish works of Kabbalah - kundulini is real but not exsplanable untill you experience it -- The only real cure after the normal attention points have been loosened up is to achieve real self mastery and internal control of the senses !!! All medication can do is attempt to dull or reduce the floating IE movement of the attention points. You first of all have to know how the mechinism works - Richard A Martin/Bloise 719 495-5826 11585 Dallas Rd Peyton CO 80831"
3,Theyre capable of better than this,"In comparison to Overcast! and the Lucy Ford EP's, godlovesugly is a disappointment. The lyrics that made Slug famous are nowhere to be found on this album. ""God Loves Ugly"", ""lovelife,"" and ""F--k You Lucy"" are all dope in their own right, but all lack the soul that is so evedient in Atmosphere's first two albums. Fans should cop this nonetheless, but it is a disappointingly middle of the roam effort from Atmosphere. They have a classic waiting to be dropped, unfortunately, this just wasn't the one."
3,"Great singles, odd flow","I'm a huge atmosphere fan, but I'm still having trouble finding any one album that out-does ""seven's travels."" The title track on this one is great, as well as ""saves the day,"" and ""f*@k you, lucy"" - think I need to give the rest of the tracks a second or third listen. Recommended, but don't expect a wall to wall hit-fest."
3,word,"First off, I'm a huge Slug mark. Have been for about 4 years now.This is nowhere near lucy ford, not a single song on this album can even approach the classics on there. But then again, that's why it is a classic.That being said, it's still a Slug album. The songs are entertaining enough, although I think Sean could take the subject matter to another level. The beats are decent, but nowhere close to some of the other albums you could be copping right now. If you're new to Slug, I suggest picking up the Lucy Ford EP to truely understand how much talant he has. If I hadn't ever heard of the guy or any of his previous work, I'd rate this a 4."
2,"""Don't-- don't, don't-- Don't believe the hype!""","Take it from Flava Flav, this album lacks the ingenuity and emotion of Slug's previous releases. If you're a big fan (like me), check it out-- maybe you'll like it. If you're not familiar with Slug's music, I reccomend Lucy Ford or, better yet, Overcast! (if you can find it.)"
2,"""Don't-- don't, don't-- don't believe the hype!""","Take it from Flava Flav, this album lacks the ingenuity and emotion of the Atmosphere's previous releases. If you're a big slug fan (like me), check it out-- maybe you'll like it. If you're not familiar with his music, I reccomend Lucy Ford or, better yet, Overcast! (if you can find it.)"
5,Simply great,"For all the hip hop fans this cd is a great treat...Atmosphere is representing for the midwest rappers and now that his new cd is getting playtime , he may finally hit it big (hopefully without selling out)..."
5,Love it.,"This is the first album I listened to made by Atmosphere. I was immediately hooked to Slugs complex lyrics and truth. It's not possible to get tired of listening to his music unlike mainstream hip-hop. I would also recommend listening to ""You can imagine how much fun were having"" ""Headshots: 7"" and both albums made by Felt."
4,..hearing Slug is like hearing that voice you wish you had when things fell apart,"Memoirs of a failed relationship brought to you in the form of beats and rhymes. Some would dismiss this as ""emo rap""...but i dismiss that claim altogether. Emotional, yes...but it brings a breath of fresh air into this hip-hop atmosphere(no pun intended)of staleness. Nowadays when rappers discuss the tribulations of a relationship, it comes off corny with an R-n-B hook and usually an R-n-B sample.Hearing Slug is like hearing that voice you wish you had when things fell apart...Aside from that premise of the album- Slug 'n Ant bring upon the hip hop storytelling youve grown to love about this group. The shout outs to wack rappers, coming up in the business, the pop culture innuendos, the troubled youth...its all touched on in this CD. Purchase this album, if not for you, then for the ugly kids out there...you wont regret it, some good hip hop here."
3,"It wasnt what i expected, but....","I still have a few tracks off this that i like without a doubt. I think that Slug did a way better job teaming up with Murs on the Felt: a tribute to christina ricci lp. For those who havent heard that cd, its definitely worth the search in my own opinion. This cd isnt for everyone, but its still good to have in your underground collection and hey they were on the cover of People's magazine when the orphaned friend of Kelly Osbourne wore an Atmosphere God Loves Ugly patch on his jacket..cant say the same for any other undeground group i know."
4,It's All About The Lyrics,"At first glance, to agree with previous reviews, the head-nodding beats sucked me in. I usually am one to pay attention to the lyrics, and you can't ignore them in Slug's tracks. If you're not sure about hip-hop and the lyrical content, or quality, then listen to ""Hair"". Although, I must admit, it's not the best tune on the album, you will be hooked. This was my first underground hip-hop cd and ""Hair"" is what got me hooked. With lines like ""I'm in my late twenties little girl don't flirt with me, I've got the capabilities to program your circuitry"" you can't but like it. Give it a spin, you won't be dissappointed."
5,Wayyyyy better than I expected. Sluggo is still the best.,"Atmosphere is my favorite group, but I'm not affraid to admit when they put out a weak album (Lucy Ford). This album is not as good as Overcast, but much much better than Lucy Ford. Slug said this was the official follow up to Overcast, and thats exactly what it sounds like to me. Slug sounds more hungry and passionate than ever on this album, and the beats are just brilliant. This is the underground album of the year, Fantastic Damage had my vote before this came out, but damn, this ish is raw. If your looking for something as good as Overcast, such a thing does not exist, if you want to hear something similar than this is your best bet, also se7en Headshots. If you thought Lucy Ford was the best Atmosphere release, look elsewhere. Slugs back, its about time."
5,One of the best albums ever made,"Shawn Daily aka slug of atmosphere is more then a rapper,he is also a poet,and he construcs one the best built albums about love and hardships.With impeciable rhymeskills he creates a beautifull masterpeice.With ant proudceing all the beats for the album it is aclassical soundscape of perfection/People theirs white rappers out their that have to say a lot besides eminem I would diffently spend my money on this album anyday."
1,get hip.,how can people find this guy so interesting?his beats are mediocre and his metaphors are near the same quality of another bad high school poet.
2,Whateva,"2 1/2Moderate alterna-hop effectively straddles the line between mainstream and underground rap without alienating either group too harshly, although ultimately the final product feels watered down and lacking replay value."
4,All hail the mighty Slug...,"Most kids seem to like this best. I love it, it was my first taste of Atmosphere, but other albums such as Lucy Ford, Seven Head Shots, and Seven's Travels seem tighter to me. But then, they're all awesome!"
5,"Maybe you don't like them but of all the stars out there, believe me, they're one of the brightest.","This is hands down my favorite atmosphere album. This album makes you feel so many things when you listen to it. It is simply incredible. I find that everytime I listen to it reminds me, in a way, of my life and struggles. It is so damn good. Buy it."
3,?,How do they get .95/oz? If you divide 8 into $13.64 you get $1.70/oz. I don't see where this is a multi-pack? Please redirect me if I am incorrect.
2,YUCK!,Sorry but this just tastes foul. My kid wouldn't go near it. Even tried mixing with with some juice. No luck.
4,Son will actually use it,"My son is 7 and does not like chewables or gummy vitamins. While he at first did not care for the smell, the 2 tsp is easy to take and similar to the dosage for medicine. Quick and he says it tastes pretty good."
4,Good Liquid Kids Multi-Vit,"I ordered this for my 18 month old son who will not eat gummies and POLY VI SOL is absolutly wretched tasting. Since he loves to take medicine out of the oral medicine syringe I thought Id give it a chance. It arrived and I took a whiff and a small taste (YUCKY!), I thought there was no way that my son would take this, I was wrong. He took it and then wanted more, so then I was relieved. I dont care if its nasty tasting to me, if he powers it down then Im happy. Ill give this a few more days to see if he still takes it, then Ill order more to keep on hand since at 2 tsp a day the bottle will go in about a month. Glad I bought this, would recommend"
3,?,How do they get $1.27/oz. If you divide 10.39 by 8 you get $1.30/oz. Check my math and tell me if I'm wrong.
3,Star Wars Connoisseur,"This is an exclusive figure set from Toys 'R' Us (although you wouldn't know it because this website doesn't always like to show pictures or give full information on the products it sells).The set includes the following figures: Darth Vader, Stormtrooper, AT-ST Driver, and an Imperial Astromech Droid.Also included are such accessories as: (1) lightsaber, (1) Stormtrooper rifle, (2) Longrifles w/ storage rack, (1)interrogation droid, (1) messenger droid, and (1) Tripod Laser Cannon w/ projectile.The set is packaged in a ""Window"" box so that all items can be viewed. This is ideal for collectors not wishing to open their ""Prized Collectibles""! Over all, this is a great item to own, if you are a Star Wars collector."
2,NOAA Radio instructions inadequate,"Looks like it could be a very nice weather radio, but here's the full set of instructions they give you on the weather radio:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) 7 band weatherband alerts you to the latest news and weather, specific to the largest nearby city. In addition you can tune into other local broadcasts with the AM/FM radio.Those AREN'T directions! I still have no clue how to get this thing to work. I've figured out on my own by looking through the internet that there's a special code to enter, but with those worthless directions I have no idea how to program them in! Thanks weatherx!"
2,Weather Radio,"This is a cute radio and it is gadgety. But not useful for our purposes. We wanted a weather radio that would have an alarm when bad weather was in the area. This one has an alarm, but did not know how it worked. We will be getting one from Radio Shack."
3,"Strong performance, poor recording","This is a very strong performance by the Berlin Philharmonic; Zubin Mehta directs the ensemble with an admirable balance of deliberate direction (at times) and careful sensitivity (at others). The Adagio, for example, is sublime (and inclines to the sensitive end of the spectrum).However, the recording leaves something to be desired. Probably most listeners will not be bothered by this. But if you listen to it on an mid-grade audiophile system or better (I listen on well-amped B&W; 683s, for example), you will be disappointed. The voices are indistinct, non-directional, and unfortunately muddied.The performance is an easy four stars. The recording--if you have sufficiently sensitive equipment--is two stars. Three stars overall."
5,Moving train scene,"There was a scene on the train where a few of the soldiers start singing ""Leaning On the Everlasting Arms"", which eventually leads to all the soldiers on the train car joining in for a rousing rendition of the timeless old hymn. It was an extremely moving and powerful moment as the soldiers headed to war and an uncertain fate."
1,Boring,"I fell asleep 15 minutes into this DVD set and haven't watched it since. After reading these other reviews I don't regret that nap one bit, and my copy is now sitting at the bottom of the canal behind my house."
1,"a ""debunkers' DVD and not recomended","I got this at Best Buy several years ago. The best I can say is that it is not as bad as the Roger Moore-fake Russian UFO DVD I also got at Best Buy. Not worth watching in my opinion, much less buying. Sets out to debunk UFOs. I would give it less than 1 star, but 1 is the lowest allowed."
1,THE ALIEN FILES NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"This is a DRY documentary style and not very informative. It is definitely NOT worth $26.99 USD plus shipping. I got this DVD for much less ($7 CAD) in a Dollar Store and I still Do Not think it is worth the money.Very Low Production values, mostly one on one dry long winded interviews...VERY low budget film and not very interesting."
3,Price a little too high,I did not compare prices on this product because I have always found Amazons price to be the lowest of any purchase I have made. This was not the case with this item. After I purchased it I found that I could have bought it locally for $60 versus what I paid here. In addition I have found it is always the female end that goes bad. I have found you can purchase this female connector for $30 dollars and repair the cord yourself. It is not hard.
5,a car seat that wears well,"We have been using the Snug Ride seat for five months now. It always fits securely into the base and is easily attached to the metro lite stroller. The dark pattern (colby) of the fabric is great. It still looks new. We did have to return our first seat after three weeks of use because the latch that attaches the seat to the base broke. It was possible to exchange it for a new one because I returned it within 90 days. I would have been irritated if I could not return it for a new one, though. If that were the case, I'm sure that my review would be very negative. It is possible that the first seat that we used was defective and is a rarity. (hopefully) We've been pleased thus far with the replacement."
3,Sure it's safe...but it's not very cozy,"I received this item as a gift and am happy that it is so highly rated for safety. My baby hasn't been born yet so I can't comment on its ease of use however, I am disappointed in the lack of padding on the seat. It's little more than fabric over the hard plastic. I can't imagine it to be very comfortable; especially for a newborn. Also, I washed the cover before use (according to the manufacturer's instructions) and there are already small holes in the back. I'm sure another wash would pull the stuffing out. Overall, it's a nice enough seat but I would expect a bit more for the price. I'll be shopping for a replacement."
4,Great car seat!,"This is a great car seat from graco. It is a very cute pattern which would work for a boy or girl. It seems very comfy for my baby, she sleeps in it frequently. My only gripe is that the handle is very loud and sticks sometimes, but maybe it just needs to be broken in. Also fits great in her matching colby stroller. Highly recommend!!"
5,Mom of 2,"I bought this seat mostly because of how well it did on the consumer reports panel, and because of high marks from other moms. It's been great. My 2 month old son loves it too. My only complaint is it's on the heavy side. But for great protection I'm willing to carry it around."
4,"Great carseat, just a few issues though","We bought this carseat for my 2nd son (who is 9 weeks old now) and love it except for a few things. The head stabilizer that comes with the seat is not sturdy enough to support a newborn's head so we had to buy another one to hold his head upright. My son was 7 lbs. at birth and not of an unusual newborn size so I'm not sure if it just did not have enough filling in it or what. Another thing Graco should consider is selling the seat as part of a ""travel system"" instead of only the stroller and seat seperate. (just a matter of convenience) Otherwise, like I said, we love the seat and the ease of the strap adjustment."
4,Great Carseat!,"I reviewed all of the car seats and the Graco SnugRide seemed the best. It was easy to install, easy to get in and out of the car and since we have the SNAP n' GO stroller, our baby doesn't even wake up when we take her from the car to the stroller. Love it! I took off one star because the handle is a little squeaky when moving it back and forth. I haven't tried to grease it up with anything so the problem could possibly go away."
4,A little too heavy to carry!,"Overall I think this is a great carseat!!!! It's easy to use and easy to install, especially when using the LATCH. I love the idea of having a carrier so I can just take my son out of the car and pop him in the Snap n' Go stroller, or on the shopping cart.However, I found this carseat to be a little heavy and awkward to carry. It was okay when my son was first born and only weighed 6 lbs, but now that he's 6 months and about 16 lbs, it's really a struggle to carry him any distance. It has been rather heavy for at least the past couple of months. I don't know if all infant carseats are this awkward, but some of the others I've seen look a little lighter and more ergonomic. We are just about ready to move him to a convertible seat now, anyway.Besides being heavy and awkward to carry, I would definitely recommend this seat!"
4,Nice infant seat!,"I really have had no problems with this seat except it could use alittle more padding for the baby - we just had to glue some foam underneath the fabric to make it a bit more comfy. Otherwise, the harness is very easy to ajust, the adjustable base works like a charm, it is light (compared to my old Graco seat that was very heavy to carry around), the canopy adjusts 180 degrees, and the seat is alittle more narrow to allow more room for the other children in the back seat. It is easy to get in and out of the car - the seat snaps into and out of the base very easily!!"
4,"Great seat, but needs more cushion!","After much research, we bought this seat for the high safety rating. We also bought the matching metrolite stroller, and I (we) have been very happy with it. My only complaint is that the seat bottom could be cushier, we put a folded cloth diaper under our son to make him more comfy. Other than that, it's a great seat/travel system. It's very easy to use - we recently went car shopping and had no trouble installing it in a variety of different SUV's to see how it fit. I highly recommend it!"
1,LATCH BREAKS TO EASY,THE LATCH ON MY SNUG RIDE BROKE 3WEEKS AFTER I STARTED TO USE IT.I EMAILED GRACO I HAD TO SEND THE CARSEAT BACK AND WAIT 2 WEEKS OR LONGER FOR A REPLACEMENT. I HAVE NEWBORN TWINS SO I NEEDED THE CARSEAT. THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT I COULDN'T GO WITHOUT A CARSEAT FOR THAT LONG. WE FINALLY WENT BACK TO BABY R US TO BUY A NEW ONE SINCE GRACO WAS NO HELP AT ALL. TO MY SURPRISE EVERY GRACO SNUG RIDE THEY HAD ON THE DISPLAY RACK WERE ALL BROKEN IN THE SAME PLACE AS MINE WAS. ONCE THAT PIECE BREAKS IT DOES NOT LATCH ON TO THE BASE OR THE STROLLER. THESE SEATS ARE NOT SAFE. THEY WAY WE FOUND OUT WAS BROKE I WENT TO LIFT THE SEAT OUT OF THE CAR WITH MY DAUGHTER IN IT AND THE SEAT LIFTED UP WITHOUT HAVING TO PULL THE RELEASE FOR IT THAT SCARED ME WHAT IF WE HAD BEEN IN A ACCIDENT GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPEN TO MY DAUGHTER. GRACO CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS NO HELP AT ALL. NEEDLESS TO SAY I WILL MORE THEN LIKELY NOT BUY ANY GRACO PRODUCTS AGAIN.
3,Make sure that you have the bigger one on hand,"My son is ready for the bigger car seat and is only 5 months. Best to get the infant/toddler car seat right off the bat-wish I had! Yes, it is very heavy too."
2,Not great during winter months for newborns above avg weight,"We bought the snugRide infant car seat but it was already too small when our son turned one month (he was approx. 10.5 lbs). As he is a winter child, when we dress him up in a snowsuit, the straps no longer buckle up. We were forced to put the straps over his shoulders only, which was obviously not safe. If your child is above average weight and you are planning to use the car seat over winter months, consider getting a convertible car seat right away. One more thing ... the car seat is VERY HEAVY, especially with a 10+ lbs newborn."
3,Snugride car seat- coby,The instructions for assembling this products were difficult to understand. The canopy was very cumbersome to assemble and the parts used to complete the canopy broke prior to its use. The fabric is nice in the beginning but it gets very tiring after about a few weeks. I find the seat lacks the cushion for the protection of the baby's head. The metrolite stroller that fits with the seat is also very cumbersome to use. It has wheels twice the size of its competititors and also approximately twice the weight.
3,Not the best but not the worst,"I don't like the handles they jam all the time. It's hard to move the handle because the buttons on the side jam. When you're trying to pick up the seat or move it, it can be a pain in the rump. It's also very heavy. I hate the shoulder straps and the harness clip. It's very pointy and when you put the baby in the carseat it jams him in the back. The carseat I had before had velcro on the straps to hold them back out of the way while you were putting the baby in the seat."
2,Problems,"I'm frustrated enough with this car seat to take the time to write a review. We carefully researched travel systems for their safety and convenience and chose the Graco Snugride Carseat in Colby and the matching MetroLite Stroller. The stroller is wonderful - lightweight and easy to handle - and we will probably enjoy it once our baby is out of the infant car seat. The car seat has two problems that continue to annoy us. First, the handle on the car seat gets stuck and is extremely difficult to adjust. Second, when our baby (now 3 1/2 months) is in the car seat, the angle is such that his head lolls forward when he is sleeping. I thought that the angle of the back seat in our car might be the problem, but this happens when the car seat is in the stroller as well. If I could do it over again, I would choose a different car seat, even if it meant forfeiting the economy of a full travel system."
4,Raven Haired and Golden Haired,"Much of the story revolves around a raven haired and a golden haired woman and a man they have in common. The story covers many subjects and crosses many national boundries. I think it has the makings of becoming a long epic, perhaps a Gormenghast Trilogy. It certainly covers subjects that are often taboo, such as rape and the false imprisonment of women. Also for good measure slavery, race (ism), genocide, and depression. The quote on the books web site (either type in the authors or title,into a search engine,) perhaps sums it up best."
4,great basic book for beginners,"This is a very basic book for beginners with great diagrams to explain text. Goes well with more in depth ""Sailing for dummies""."
5,"Kicks in within 20 minutes, just as advertised.","On the few times I've needed to go to sleep immediately when I get home from work so I can wake up early for something, I've used a couple of these Melatonin tablets, and they've always worked. The bottle says to take them 20 minutes before bed, and they weren't kidding- after 15 minutes, I started to get a little woozy, and 5 minutes later, I was out. A few years ago I used a lot of different kinds of sleeping pills because of problems I had falling asleep, and they all took much longer to kick in. With these, everything was good, and I really did get a full 8 hours of sleep each time I've used them- something I rarely get with or things like this.I haven't had any side effects aside from a lot of stiffness in my limbs when I wake up, but it's nothing a couple minutes of stretching can't fix. I can't believe how energized and well-rested I felt upon waking up. And for the price, I'd say this brand is easily worth the money."
4,So far so good,I struggle with sleep but I have noticed I fall asleep faster when I take these along with my sleeping pills than I do when either one or the other is taken
3,Natural peaceful sleep,"After suffering from insomnia for years I decided to try something closer to natural and not count on prescription medication. This allows me to fall asleep fairly quickly, within 20 minutes and sleep through the night, I do wake up a little tired but that wears off fairly quickly.(a few minutes) It helps to actually get the eight hours of sleep your body naturally needs and I find that I am falling in to an easier pattern of going to sleep at night without having to take anything!"
1,Caused Severe Dehydration & Headache - Disrupting Sleep,"I didn't even want to give it 1 star, but I had no choice. There should be NEGATIVE STARS available to choose.This product must contain some cheap fillers or something, because it caused me severe dehydration and dry mouth during sleep, which woke me up a few times during the night for water. It also caused me to LOSE so much water that I had to wake up costantly to urinate. So it kind of worked against itself and I ended up with LESS sleep than I would otherwise have had. This severe dehydration was also responsible for giving me a splitting headache by morning which woke me up early. I hardly felt any sleepy effects from the 5mg. I immediately turned around and bought NOW BRAND 5mg CAPSULES on Amazon.com. Don't waste your time on Natrol. I will avoid this BRAND entirely. Natrol = BAD. Now = GOOD."
2,Didn't work for me,"I tried this quite a few times but didn't notice much difference. I guess everyone's different and what works for some, doesn't for others... and vice versa."
3,I didn't sleep any differently,"I took this hoping for a deeper sleep, not that I was sleeping poorly to begin with. I guess I just want to find whatever supplements I might be missing out on for a better life. I'm convinced that a proper diet is the best thing for anyone.The four supplements I still stand by:<any brand>:MultivitaminsB-12,6 and Folic Acid complexGlucosamine and Chondroitinspecifically: Natural Calm MagnesiumI still take fish oil, but I happen to have a very large supply... It may benefit my joints, but I give more credit to glucosamine and chondroitin."
4,Good product,I took a full 5mg to help me sleep and it was perfect. Able to sleep rough the night for once and did not have the drowsiness effect when I woke up.
3,I don't want time released,They can cause tummy upset. It's a good product for a good price! I just don't want time released. Thanks.
2,Does not work,This item does not let you sleep as what they mentioned in 20 minutes after taking it. The best for sleeping is taking Panadol night.
1,This product contains B6,I didn't notice that this product contains 10 mg of B6. I took it last night and spent a miserable night. It did the opposite of what melatonin alone does. I can't tolerate B6 unless it's in food and wish I had looked more closely at the label.
3,HAS B6 in it--not easy to see on label,"I got this from amazon because of the time release and my son who has sleep issues. I bought the 3 mg too.So i didn't notice it has B6 which always makes him barf unless he has sufficient food, and sometimes even if he does have sufficient food.So if you have no issue with B vitamins, it's fine and I'm sure it's a good thing for most, but I just wanted to make sure others don't miss that little detail becasue of closing examining the label on another size and making assumptions, as I did. . ."
4,The lower the dose the better the sleep,"It is very easy to overdose on melatonin because most preparations contain much more of this hormone than the body needs. As we age, our bodies make less melatonin, especially in the small hours of the night so we wake up convinced it is morning already. However like with every hormone, replacing what is missing is a matter of replacing exactly what is missing, not more. According to many published papers out of MIT, Boston University and other academic institutions, the amount of melatonin that we need is no more than 0.3 mg, not 3 mg. Taking more leaves you with a hangover and eventually the body may even stop making its own melatonin since you are supplying it from a bottle. Since it is almost impossible to get 0.3 mg these days , I always cut the l mg dose in half using a pill cutter . ).5 mg is probably close enough to the dose I need."
3,No Noticeable Difference in Sleep,Not sure if this product helped with my sleep or not. I do think it is time released. What I found while taking this product that I would still sleep off and on throughout the night and then awake about the same. I think I wanted a uninterrupted sound sleep but did not obtain that with this product.
1,Doesn't work for me.,I've been using several brands of melatonin - this one doesn't seem to work. I wake frequently during the night with this.
2,doesn't last long enough,This melatonin puts me to sleep but I wake up about 6 hours later unable to go to sleep. My sleep quality has gotten worse since I took this one. I'm going to try a lower dose.
4,"Goog product, but didn't work for me",I bought this product to try stop taking my sleeping pill. I think it didn't work cause my body is so used to prescription pills. I'm gonna try again cause all of my friends say it's a great product

2,The 3mg works for me ... so why not this???,"Haven't a clue as to the reason, but ... truth is, the older, regular release 3mg. tablets by Natrol work just fine for me. But this Timed Release 5mg. doesn't do it for me. Strange..."
1,Time Release is a marketing ploy,"TR will attract people who do not know how melatonin works. It does NOT keep you asleep all night, requiring time release. In you body it is released in a flood to get you ready to sleep and will help you GET to sleep. But it does not KEEP you asleep. Using TR is counter-productive.Also, be sure to never take melatonin during the day. It will actually harm your body if you take it while it still light out. It is NOT a sleep drug that will just put you to sleep anytime."
3,Its just ok,"Its suppose to aid in sleeping, and i didnt sleep any better after using it for a month..."
4,I'm really impressed!,This works really well. It makes me drowsy before I go to bed and I feel well rested when I wake up. Don't take it to late though because doing so might make you drowsy and lethargic when you wake up.
4,Makes my HEMI sound that much nicer.,I bought this because I cant right now afford to put duals on my truck. Let me tell you this muffler is great. It really is not that loud when just idling which is why I knocked off a star also it is starting to slightly rust on the outside not too bad though yet ive only had it on for two months so I will follow up. When you step on the Gas you can really hear it and that is what makes it so great. People know you are there and to get out of you're way. Really makes a nice addition to the truck. Might be putting some duals on though soon to make the rumble louder!
3,Good light Indian music,"It is good light Indian music that leaves one wanting a bit more, and waiting for her next release."
4,The soothing voice .,The voice of the singer is in harmony with the instrumentation.Compared to other popular gazals this earns 4 stars.
4,Reminds me of another current favorite,"The music on this album is wonderful and varied in feel--humor, longing, celebration, romance. I, too, first heard her on NPR but it took me a long time to finally pick up this CD. I listen to it often...love to put Kiran A. in a 5-cd random shuffle with Cesaria Evora, Lila Downs, Sanseverino, and Bebel Gilberto! A great international mix that puts me in a good mood.If you want to try something else with the Indian flavor that reminds me very much of this group of songs, the instrumentation & lyrics, do check out the Indian film soundtrack of ""Omkara"" (a fantastic Hindi modern-day adaptation of Othello) by Vishal Bharwadj and Gulzar. The music for the film (to me) has the feeling of Kiran's CD, with the harkening back to traditional sounds but in an updated fashion, with great instrumentation and beautiful lyrics, delivered by great players and singers."
3,Works Sometimes,"What a neat idea! Spy Gear has some great ideas, the room alarm being one of them. However, the room alarm seems to work sporadically. Sometimes it does what it's supposed to do, other times it does not. My son loves to try to catch us with the alarm. I wish the motion sensor worked a little better so that it could pick you up from a further distance. I thought the alarm worked good enough to not send it back. (Like I did with the Spy Car I purchased with the Spy Alarm for my son's birthday.)"
5,Very cool,This is very cool. I am surprised they no longer make them. Kids are having a blast setting up remote traps all over the house.
3,good for spy toy lovers,My 9 yr old loves the spy gear toys and this one didn't disappoint.I have ordered from Wild Planet before and am pleased with the products.
1,"poorly made, dart shooter stopped working",The dart shooter on this piece of crap stopped working five minutes after the kid started playing with it. he had five minutes of real joy and then suddenly couldn't get the darts to lock into the shooter at all. then tears for god knows how long. I always want to throttle the makers of cheap crap like this.
2,Smoked duck,"I have never had smoked duck before so perhaps my expectations were too high. It was a disappointment, proving to be tough (in fact it was hard) with poor flavor. As a result of its desicated state it was also difficult to carve.Laurie Penman"
5,Helpful advice,"This manual is for all 1.6 liter Miatas with pop-up headlights. It does not cover the post '98 model with fixed headlights, nor the 1.8 liter model (with pop-up headlights) for which there's a separate manual. I hope this advice is helpful - Rod Grainger, author & publisher."
3,"Clear, very thorough.",This book is definitely a must for anyone who owns a Miata. It provides clear instructions and pictures for each repair. One drawback...it does not have an index.
3,Libretto would be helpful,"This CD is about G&S's crown jewel: The Midado. The music is great. The musicianship is great.Now we hear from the curmudgeon. I'm sure that there are those who could not care less if the CD came with or without a libretto. I happen NOT to be one of them. And unfortunately this album comes without one.Gilbert's machine-gun poetry needs to be read at the time that Sullivan's music is being sung. For me, not having a libretto is like getting only half a loaf. Sullivan's music is sublime, but Gilbert's poetry needs to be read and savored. You can't do that without a libretto."
2,MODERN VERSION - Not original lyrics,"Well, the best thing about Amazon is the reviews posted for each item. I should've looked at the reviews before buying this one! It is a very well produced version/album, but I am a Gilbert & Sullivan purist and was displeased to see some of the lyrics changes. To find that ""the Lady Novelist"" had been taken of ""The List"" and replaced with someone else was horrifying! :)If you're not a purist like me and some of the others here, this version is great, but I miss the original lyrics and I don't reccomend this album to others like me!"
3,Case is not good,"The tripod barely fits in the case, making the case worthless. It is also important to note that this tripod does not come with a quick release. The tripod itself is well made, very sturdy, and I like it. I just wish the case was nicer."
1,"NOT QUIET, NOT AT ALL, even though advertised as such","Tremendously disappointing! LOUDER than 2 other dehumidifiers I have compared it to, even though it was supposedly engineered to be quite. Clearly they can just say whatever they want. I originally bought an LG dehumidifier from Home Depot, but I returned that one because it was too loud. I found this ""QuietCare"" model online and ordered it. It's MUCH louder than the LG model was. It's also much louder than the 2 my parents own. I'm sitting about 35 feet away from it now (it's in bedroom, I'm in living room) and I have to turn the TV way up just to hear over it. Don't even dream about being able to sleep with it operating. This ""QuietCare"" nonsense is a complete scam and I'm just disappointed that I had to order online (couldn't find any stores carrying it in my area) and cannot return it now."
4,"We now have a dry, comfortable room","We bought this dehumidifier to use in an add-on room which was built on a slab. The room was very damp, especially in cold weather. It has window walls with double pained glass that got fogged up on the inside. Mildew around the windows was a problem as well. There was so much humidity in the room that when we first purchased the dehumidifier we had to empty it approximately every 12 hours. The dampness it took out of the room was absolutely amazing. We no longer have any fogged up windows or mildew problems. It now runs intermitently and keeps our room dry and comfortable. I would recommend it highly. The only drawback is that it is noisy, similar to a window air-conditioner."
4,Great value,"This is the first dehumidifier I have owned, so I really can't compare it to others. We bought it to take away some of the damp smells that seemed to come from our finished basement. This thing seems to have done the trick. Run continuously, it wrings out the moisture quite well, making a noticeable improvement after only a couple of hours. Run on the range settings, you can specify it to come on only when the humidity reaches a certain point, allowing you to save power. We haven't noticed much of an impact on our electricity bill. The only drawback is the thing is a bit loud, but not any worse than a window-unit style air conditioner."
4,Great but loud.,"Great dehumidifier. Works very well. Takes gallons of water out of my house. I love everything about it except one detail. It's loud. I can't compare it to others as this is the only one I've owned, but it's the loudest appliance I own. Not a problem if you're putting it in a basement, but maybe a bit much in a living/sleeping area."
1,Very noisy and poor quality,"We bought this last year for our finished basement. It is VERY noisy. When we have guests over that stay in the basement, they always ask to turn it off because they cannot sleep with the loud noise it makes. Also, earlier this week I was emptying the tank and noticed cracks all over it. We now have to get a new one, but I will never buy this brand again."
1,RWA Golden Medallion Winner...HOW?,"In a sentence: Widow hires gorgeous guy to help save her (...).This is the only review and I can understand why. I can't believe this book won an award. I bought a box full of RWA (Romance Writers Awards?) 'winners'. Most were losers. I don't know what the criteria is, but I won't ever buy a book on their recommendation again.I could not finish this book and would rather reread a favorite than waste my time on trying to finish this again."
5,special performance book,"Special performance book for a special performance aircraft. Great photos, concise diagrams and detailed design and service records make this a must have for your aircraft library."
5,"Excellent, Promises from our LORD!","I have had a copy of this book since the 70's. I found it still in print on Amazon and was so glad. I bought a copy of it for my children, grown adults, who had some pleasant memories rekindled from their late father reading this book back then. A great booklet to enclose in a greeting card for any occasion. RJS"
5,helpful resource,"For those who are unfamiliar with where to find Biblical promises, this little booklet is easy to carry, with easy-to-find passages based on topics applicable to daily life and spiritual questions. A true blessing thank you."
5,Awesome Promises!,"I feel Pastor Wilkerson has done an excellent job of collecting and categorizing scriptures from the Holy Bible. You know there are a lot of scriptures well versed in most promise collection books, but a lot of the promises collected here are fresh; they add meaning to the collections. Well done Pastor Wilkerson!"
2,varied,"In this promise guide He uses many different versions of the bible and He teaches that there are conditions to be met for these promises to be claimed. A Promise really is twofold in the bible. God gives freely, but also requires obedience."
5,Good replacement part,It works great. One battery pack charges up perfect but the other pack is bad. Will replace it when needed.
1,someone messed up,"this charger was recommended to me by amazon for a battery I d bought, I knew some thing was wrong when it wouldnt fit, , like a round hole and a square peg, a 18 volt doesnt fit a 24 charger. when you suggest a accessory, ,. one should make sure its fits . they took it back , but it was the delay and hassle. Dan"
4,B&D 24 Volt recharger,This was a replacement purchase for a missing recharger for a Black and Decker 24 Volt Cordless Drill. This is a solid unit and performs exactly as the unit was designed to do. This unit works perfectly for those who need a 24 Volt Charger for a Black and Decker product.
5,24V replacement charger for Firestorm,The new charger is the same as the old one except it works at charging the battery up. Something happened to the old one where it wouldn't charge anymore.
4,Great charger,"I bought this replacement charger due to my old one being inop, it's a perfect replacement for original. Tried it right away and it worked fine charging all my batteries."
5,Works Great,"Glad I could find this online, none of the stores in my area had the right one. This one is just what I needed."
5,brand new,"It was brand new and shipped in a standard time, good price, and glad there was free shipping thanks!"
4,DVD Demystified 3rd Edition,"Very comprehensive. At times repeatative, but gives a good history of the subject. I would like to see a larger and more interactive DVD supplied with the book."
4,Pretty Darn good,"This book is pretty good, you see it's a solo adventure book in which you help a elven princess find her brother, a prince who is being held by the orcs of mirkwood. this story has aragorn making an appearence in it too. the only reason i gave it only four stars is the slightly confusing play-style."
1,Serious design flaw,"This camera has a serious design flaw. Do not buy this camera if you are planning to use it outdoors in sun light, because you cannot see anything in the view finder. If you have the sun behind you, the sun light makes the view finder appear like a mirror, so instead of looking at the object, you are looking at an image of yourself. If you are facing the sun, the viewfinder appears black. This is with winter sun, cannot imagine what it will be in the summer."
1,Problem Camera,"Camera worked OK at first, then stopped working. We got a new battery, still no power. I plugged it into a correct voltage charger, still nothing. The camera had not been dropped, has always been kept in a padded case when we travel, etc.I will never buy a Pentax product again. This is the second one that we purchased on recommendation of a friend that failed within a few years of ownership.Pictures taken with it were just OK"
1,Stay away from Pentax cameras - bad products - service even worse,"Camera offers great features and high quality pictures; however, it is poorly built and won't last very long.I purchased mine in 8/06. By December it was broken (lens mechanism ceased) and had to be shipped to Pentax for repair (on my dime). It took them 10 weeks to realize they can't fix it and send me a replacement camera.6 months later the replacement camera broke (same problem). I sent it back to Pentax 6 weeks ago and they still have it. They no longer make this camera, so they can't replace for me. They won't refund my money and pretty much won't do anything for the customer.Bottom line - spend your money elsewhere. Buy a canon, buy a Casio, buy a Kodak - just don't buy a Pentax."
5,Holds interest in its shadowy and wryly malefic way,"Michael Markus' East Of Mourning is a superbly crafted dark comedy about the Great Canadian Dream gone bad for a frustrated hockey coach and the young, talented hockey player upon whom he pins the last of his bitter dreams. Sex, drugs, rock and roll, suicide, murder, and of course hockey all lurk within the eerily inviting pages of this dynamic and sharply framed literary tableau. Aptly written in a literary style as fast-moving as the sport of hockey itself, East Of Mourning captures the imagination and holds interest in its shadowy and wryly malefic way. Highly recommended."
2,Buggy,Software has bugs and doesn't run that well. Hard to use the mouse to shoot. Game frequently locks up when running. Not that impressed.
5,ONLY TRUELY GREAT ENNEAGRAM BOOK,I have read 8-9 enneagram books and have frankly gotten tired of the whole system. But after finally buying Naranjo's book I see the application of it as a legitimate system within transpersonal psychotherapy. Few other authors of the enneagram have any valid credentials to teach this system. Great book.
4,"Nice shoes,bad packaging","The shoes were beautiful,but had to be returned due to being defective.Also the way their packaged stretches out the strap around your heel.But,Ive since purchased other shoes that Im very happy with.I still think they should reconsider how they store shoes though.Leather is going to stretch if continued pressure is applied to it."
1,This is not a book about Ozzy Osbourne !,"Don't make the same mistake as I did, this is not a book about Ozzy Osbourne. This is a short, easy to read, book for kids between 10-12 years old about some runaway kid named Ozzy. You can imagine that I was disappointed after ordering it from U.S. (I live in Sweden) hoping to get an Ozzy biography. I guess this is the risk when buying things of the internet."
5,Tamrac 677 Highly Capable for Camcorder as well as still cam,"Bag is perfect for a Canon GL-2 Camcorder and accessories/lenses, very capable for an outboard tripod. Rolls best on a hard surface, but the backpack option is a great idea. Although relatively compact, it seems to be a capacious receptor for my equipment."
5,Love these mirrors,"I have two of these mirrors that we used for years for plucking our own eyebrows. I love the suction cups, now that my sight is declining I can put it on my kitchen window and use natural light."
5,Cuisinart coffee carafe,Just as previous one that cracked! Item was Received very quickly! It's great to have coffee waiting in the morning!!
1,arby,"The watch did not work properly. I had it replaced by WATCH ZONE but the watch still did not work properly. Customer service at WATCH ZONE was very professional and helpful and got me a refund very quickly. In summary ""Wenger-bah"" ""Watch Zone-good""."
4,Works well,"I haven't tried other Melatonin sleep aids so my experience is only with Natrol melatonin. I have found that 3mg is too high of a dose for me so I cut the tabs in half and only take 1.5mg at a time. Also, I have heard people say that they take melatonin every night and this is much better than taking other drugs like tylenol pm but I still think it's a bad idea to become totally dependent on melatonin. Another thing I have discovered is that if I get too much or too little sleep when taking melatonin I feel worse than I would if I did not take it. For example if I get under 6 hours of sleep or over 9 hours of sleep I will feel even groggier in the morning than I normally would. The whole purpose of melatonin is to reset your sleep cycle so this product is great if you have become an insomniac for a few days and need to get back into a normal sleep cycle."
1,useless,i have tried this multiple times in hope for it to work .nothing .didn't work at all . didn't feel anything . didn't put me to sleep .no side effects felt . nothing .i did try other brands of melatonin and it worked just fine .but not this one.i even tried it with the 5HTP pills as some reviews have recommended . but nothing changed .
4,Great product,"I found this to be the best sleeping tablet, although it helps more if you take it on a regular basis and often is more helpful if you take it a while before going to bed (its definitely not an instant result) you don't feel groggy the next day."
1,It Didn't Work For Me : (,"I tried this out due to my insomnia, as I've tried all other things on the market. I was on Ambien CR (great stuff) for a month and my insurance company will not pay for more than a 30 day supply a year - so I've been trying everything on the market since. This product didn't help me go to sleep (took at 10pm - went to sleep around 3am) but it did leave me feeling groggy the next morning with a headache, and most of the morning at work the feeling hung around. Maybe it works for people who just occasionally have trouble sleeping - but for insomnia I'm not sure this is a helpful product."
1,This Was Highly Recommended....and I Don't Know Why,"Sick and tired of getting only 2 to 3 hours of sleep per night and having to face 10 - 12 hour work days, several people recommended melatonin for sleep. They swear by it (though they've never actually used it). I broke down and bought a bottle and here I am at 6 a.m., STILL awake and have to be up and getting ready for work at 11 a.m. It did make me sleepy in a short period of time, and I did fall asleep much earlier than usual, which is what I wanted, but I didn't stay asleep (which is the same problem with OTC sleep aids). I slept for 45 mnutes and have now been awake ever since. I awoke with aching, cramping feet and ankles, and my feet feel like they weigh twice as much as they usually do. This hasn't happened since I was pregnant 21 years ago. They ache so bad, I have to keep rubbing them and going back to sleep looks impossible. I would not recommend melatonin for help in sleeping. I feel more miserable than when I take nothing."
2,Heavy on Social Pathology,This book offers little new information about race andneighborhoods. It tends to play on stereotypes and social pathologyarguments at the expense of a deeper analysis of race relations inAmerican cities.
5,Demonstration quality sound,Superb performances. This Sony CD is one of the finest engineered recordings I have heard.
4,Good Recording,"I have to agree that there is nothing wrong with the sound. On the contrary, this is a great quality recording and each of the pieces is worth the price of the disc. The cello sound is crystal clear. I still have no favorites, well maybe the Bartok piece but it is difficult to say depending on one's mood. Each piece is interesting and captivating enough to make you listen to it more than once. I would like to listen to more of Stephen Albert's works and to recommend the Rouse's Cello Concerto with Yo Yo Ma and Zinman."
2,Bad Recording,I had a hard time listening to this CD simply because I couldn't hear parts of it. It sounded like it was recorded live in a hollow concert hall with bad acoustics. The quiet parts would barely come through my speakers...so I would go to turn it up. Then when the rest of the orchestra joined I was blasted out. I was so annoyed at having to adjust the volume for many of the tracts. I wasted my money when buying this one.
3,"For parents, not educators","I was hoping this book would be a useful resource for developing supplemental activities for an elementary-level (K-5) curriculum on non-violence and conflict resolution. But it is really geared toward parents (as the title indicates), not educators. The activities and required materials are suitable for an interpersonal setting, not really for the average classroom or after school programs. I found that104 Activities That Build: Self-Esteem, Teamwork, Communication, Anger Management, Self-Discovery, Coping Skillsby Alanna Jones, was more useful for my needs/goals."
4,extremely helpful,"While no singlebook replaces all parental discipline and the wisdom of the ages, this book gathers hundreds of ideas from different places. Everyone I've talked to has heard of one or two before--all different--but to have them all togetehr is a great resource. More important, they work. Theiy are fun; they increase involvement with teaching. And they provide valuable teaching moments in the context of having fun with your kids. A great find!"
3,I wanted to like this more...,"I am a child therapist and I use the activities from this book very little. I wish that I found the activities compelling enough to use them on a regular basis. Maybe it is just the current caseload that I have right now that is limiting me.As a school social worker, I think that this book with come more in handy to demonstrate character education concepts to groups. The activities are brief, require very little materials, and should get children to think.I think the activities would be most ideal for children ages 7-10."
5,Great Choice for Teaching Kids Values!!,"I love this book, it is easy to follow and has fun entertaining was to teach kids values."
5,"10-Minute Life Lessons for Kids : 52 Fun and Simple Games and Activities to Teach Your Child Honesty, Trust, Love, and Other Imp",Absolutely Fantastic- easily applied to children actually gives age specific exercises. Makes you take note of your actions and words. Everyone can learn from this book!
5,A great gift from Grandma or Grandpa!,"I bought this book for my daughter and her new growing family. It makes for great interaction and lively discussion. The dialog they have going on now is refreshing. If you have only have 10 quality minutes a day to spend with your child reading this book together will make it well spent! Ann Clarke, author ofPeople Are So Different!based on tolerance and understanding."
3,10-minute life lessons for kids,I didn't read this. I purchased it for a gift for a family with small children in hopes they can make good use of it
1,UNREALISTIC,"While these activities may be good for the very young, they are certainly not going to prepare a child for the rough and tumble real world out there; a world where not everyone is nicey-nice. Teaching values is important, But I think that our parents and grandparents did it better than the ways you find here."
5,A way of better organizing your closet,Having a single hanger for holding shirts has cut down on the number of wrinkled ones. It puts 4 individual in the space of one and opens up a lot more room. I am happy with this tool.
4,Good for the price.,"I thought this was a very good scope for the price. Very comfortable and good sound. It arrived promptly, I had a couple of my colleagues try it and found that when we were working together, they enjoyed borrowing it:)"
4,Good for price,Its cheap and looks like Littmann cardiology. Sound quality is not as good as Littmann cardiology but good enough to listen and diagnose coomon things ....might not catch suttle sounds. I think its worth its price.
1,not actually compatible with the 5840 cn,"I purchased these awhile ago and i have the brother 3840cn and these don't work with it. in fact they ended up leaking but still would not print. no matter how many times you clean and re-install them. so needless to say i went to a store and purchased them, but got the brother brand name and they worked just fine. so i don't know if it works with the other models listed, but it don't work with mine."
2,Lacks emotional depth,"This recording disappoints me. Bronfman seems to work his way through Prokofiev's second piano concerto focused only on the difficult notes. The recording lacks the intensity and emotion the piece is capable of. The Prokofiev piano concerto #2 is one of my favorite pieces of music, but I honestly recomend a better recording. Michael Beroff has a recording out of the piece that is by far, one of the best recordings I've ever heard. If you want to hear the emotion involved in Prokofiev's best concerto, listen to Beroff."
1,Not as good as other titles...,"This book is a thinly veiled anti-choice text. It doesn't examine how heavy-handed moral stances contribute to the grief and isolation that women who choose to obtain abortions subsequently experience. The Healing Choice is a much, much better book than this one. (I gave it 1 star because it's not possible to enter 1/2 or 0 stars.)"
5,Post-abortive women are not the only ones who suffer!,"Read this book. It changed my life. Almost had an abortion with my daughter... the guilt and pain over only thinking about it caught me off guard. My heart goes out to all the women and men who are currently suffering in silence after their abortion experiences...Thank you Dr. Burke for writing this book... it's really helped me relate and reach out to many of my friends who have made the tragic choice of abortion and were never the same afterwards.Sincerely,Jennifer Nelson, 25Liberty, 5"
2,Not Impressed and it does not have one single diamond.,"Oh boy, I was so excited for this watch. I read all the reviews and decided to ordered it. When I took the first look my first reaction was why the heck the description says ""diamond"" watch when there is not one single diamond? I almost cried of disappointment when I open the box. My daughter first reaction was ""mom..it looks like a men's watch"". I hate to admit it but she is right. The watch is extremely masculine and overall is quite average looking. Needles to say I returned the next day."
3,BETTER THAN MOST,"WHILE i CAN'T RECALL A SINGLE EXAMPLE IN THE BOOK OF AN ACTUAL TEENAGEMILLIONAIRE, THE BOOK IS A BETTER PRIMER ON BUSINESS FOR A YOUNG PERSON THAN MOST.ALL IN ALL, NOT A BAD READ."
5,Loved every second of this book,"What a fun book! I loved it, and laughed so hard! I've passed it on to several of my friends, and they all enjoyed it. I didn't want it to end, and I can't wait for Saralee's next novel!"
1,What a whiney woman!,"I bought this book after reading the glowing reviews, but the main character was such a self-absorbed whiner, I could hardly get through it. The supernatural element is almost non-existant, and I really dislike stories about a woman who ""needs"" a man in her life so bad, she will do anything to get one. Not a well-adjusted main character and she never grows into one either. Very frustrating and a waste of time to read! I am sorry that sounds harsh, but at $13 for an oversize paperback these days, I don't like blowing my money or time on a lousy book."
1,Rather boring story,"I am not sure why this book received all these good reviews...well, must be that other readers taste differs to mine but I found it rather boring. The main character has one nervous breakdown after the other, the characters themselves are not very believable...as is the problem with the whole story and the dialogues...oh well. Certainly my first and last book by this author."
2,Outisde my box,"Not the worst book I've ever read, but definitely not the best either. I read this as part of a book group. We all thought it was meh. There was nothing sympathetic about the main character. And honestly, I couldn't wait to be finished with it. But, it was outside of my box, so there was that."
5,"Superb second novel, by witty authoress","Loved it, loved it, loved it! Claire Voyant is a superb second novel, by an exceptionally witty authoress. The story line is ironically thought-provoking, while the creative character development is realistic, and sufficiently convulated to grip the reader. This novel is a ""one night stand"", meaning I couldn't put it down, until I finished it on the first round. Great story, dealing with adoption, love, marriage, karma, astrology and the ""other side"". Looking forward to many future years of reading Ms. Rosenberg's upcoming books. She is extremely talented, making us laugh and cry, but never boring!Arlene Millmanauthor of ""Boomerang - A Miracle Trilogy"""
4,creative plot,"I really enjoyed this book a lot. I thought the plot was very creative (not realistic, but definitely original). The plot also flowed well and interconnected without a hitch. The author ties up all the loose ends very neatly, you aren't left in the dark with certain issues as other authors do occasionally.There were a few down points but nothing major enough to make me dislike the book.I would recommend this book to any girlfriend looking for a good read."
3,Hummingbird Stories,"I purchased this video for my 3 year old granddaughter, and though it was good, and was educational, Ifelt it would not hold her interest. :-)"
1,No worthed,"I ordered 3 packs of these bulb for my car, at first it looked like a greenish light but thought it was just me so when nightfall came the lights still were green!!!! they are not blue, if you are looking for blue bulbs do not get these!!!! get LED or other color"
5,The best,"I've read all four books in this series and True Courage is the best. My attention was caught almost immediately and, unlike the others, the suspence kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next. All the books in the series are good but I like this one best."
3,not up to Henderson standard,Dee Henderson's books usually have a tight plot and characters who draw in a reader. This book's characters were surprisingly two-dimensional and the plot moved in fits and starts. Her other Uncommon Heroes books have more riveting plots and characters. I highly recommend her other books - she's one of the best writers of faith that I have run into - but this one is just not up to the same quality.
3,Good Design but...,"It's a good design but its not stiff enough. They skimped on plastic and it bends under the pressure needed to rub out a spasm. It could be perfect if they would thicken it and strengthen it . It needs to be stiffer guys, you've failed in the engineering department, great design but mediocre to lousy execution. To bad they were cheap skates and held back on the plastic. It would only take a few ounces more plastic to make it perfect"
4,Good but not great,"I bought two of these at the same time and found that the roller attachment doesn't move as smoothly as I had hoped because is rubs against its plastic casing at times. Having three attachment options (roller, trigger point ball, and back scratcher) is nice, but in all honesty I don't use the back scratcher much. The trigger point ball is good for kneeding knotted up muscles or sore areas, while the roller is good for massaging a larger area. I have no problems recommending this item to family and friends."
1,Too many problems,"In addition to the flow problems mentioned above, the directions for installation were very unclear and and the filter cannot be used for hot water; cold only. Not worth the price or the hassle!"
2,Lousy Lousy flow,"If you're not especially thirsty and can wait a full 90 seconds for a glass to fill up, go right ahead and order this product. However, if, like me, you want to use it for cooking, you'll have to turn the water on and then leave it running, (or should I say dripping) into the pot while you walk on the treadmill, pay the bills, and vacuum the floors. Only then will the pot be 3/4 full! I agree with the second rating about the flow problems. What a disappointment! I have the filter installed for only about two weeks and already I have to wait and wait and wait. (I am typing this review as my pot fills up!)"
2,"This is a well intentioned book, plagued with errors.","We recently used this book in a dental hygiene program and found it very frustrating. The self instructional format was fairly well plotted out, and the intentions of the book as a program of study were admirable. However, as a class, we found many errors and contradictions in the text. My personal advice would be to wait for a next edition when more through editing has been accomplished."
4,A good introduction into dental anatomy.,"This book is an excellent resource for anyone wishing an introduction to the topic of dental anatomy. I think any first year dental student would find this especially helpful. The text is divided up into modules, and then into frames, with the answers to questions within the frames located in the margin. The book is very good about reinforcing terms that may not be familiar to the beginning student of dentistry or to the layman. However, I do not recommend this book for someone who has had a course in dental anatomy. I initially bought the book as a study aid for part one of the dental national boards. Having had dental anatomy coursework, as well as other courses which used the same information as a foundation, I found the reinforcement of terms I already knew to be rather tedious. I think that if I had found it before starting dental school though, it would have been much more valuable to me."
3,"A Bad Name,and not much better album","Ok,I have been waiting to hear this album for a while now.But I should have waited longer.It's not a terrible album,it's just no diferent form from the first to last song.It's like they couldn't change the tempo to make a song sound different from the one before.I gave it 3 stars because they do a good job on that tempo.And it's no wonder why this band didn't go no where."
1,Projector Bulbs Not Included,"Notice that the offer includes 'normal wear and tear' as being covered. But when one reads the details in the 'pdf' document, after details like not being covered for 'war' they add that bulbs and so on are not included.The most expensive item in a projector is the bulb, often costing $300 - $400.So Projector buyers beware- The fine print excludes the bulb even though the sales language appears to include it."
3,Has its pros and cons,"This binder is similar to most regular size binders made to hold 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper. Although it seems a little pricey for a binder, this size is not in as much demand as the regular size, so I accepted the idea of the higher price.Pros: 1. It is fairly good quality. 2. This particular binder had the lowest price of others I compared. 3. It does adequately hold 8 1/2 x 14 inch paperCons: 1. I was hoping the three bottom rings were set at the same distance as a regular size binder, but when I transfer sheets from a regular size binder, I have to reset the distances between holes in my hole punch and repunch holes in the sheets. 2. I would have preferred a view binder where I could insert a sheet inside the front and back, but the front and back are solid."
2,AWFUL,"This toy was not very well made. Mr. Fantastic broke the very first day, the inviable woman is very ugly and also broke the human torch arm broke off and his eyes and mouth look very strange. But the Thing {Ben Grimm } is alright"
2,Very Poor Product,I have gone through 4 of these in the last 3 years. I always carried a spare as they never lasted much more then 1 year before going bad. SMC has always replaced them for free until that last one when they said the product was discontinued and they would not even talk to me about it unless I paid them to talk to me. These things are junk! Stay away from them. By them from a reputable company like Netgear.
1,Not good with older house wiring,"This product may be fine for those with new construction, but my house has some older wiring and I barely get connection to my router with this device. I did some research regarding this type of product (unfortunately after the fact) and found that this is a common problem. This is not stated anywhere in the marketing of this product, which is why I am giving this a low rating. I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known."
3,Just okay,"The pouch is too small. Without a cup, my junk is falling out all over the place. Trying to fit a properly sized large cup in this large jock doesn't go so smoothly. Going up a size doesn't work because I'm 5'10"" and 165lbs. and the elastic wouldn't do any work."
4,A must for any football books collection,"Here a book I recommend to any football fan.Before I read this book the only thing I know about them is Jack Lambert and the ""Immaculate reception"" of Franco Harris.With this book I discover an unbelievable team,Bradshaw,Stallworth,Blount and the team of the 70`s.The effort of the Rooney family to keep the Steelers in Pittsburg.The story from when the team name was ""Pirates"" to the first few years of the 90`s.Their association with the Philadelphia Eagles to form the Steagles.The rivalry with the Browns.And the most surprising for me,the number of championships and Superbowls this team appear.A must on your football books collection. If you want to learn more about this team this is the book I recommend to you."
3,"Nice, but...","The cookware is heavy, cooks well and does stack nicely. All of the other reviews seem very accurate. In addition, the cookware can be set on the table for service thanks to the unusual shape. Now, for the bad: the quality is clearly not up to par. On two of my pieces, the handles are clearly riveted crooked. On a third, the scratch marks of a buffer gone horribly wrong blatantly mar the polished finish. So, for design and function, I would rate these 5 stars. However, for the poor quality control, I would rate these a 1 star, lower than even cut rate cookware. Maybe it was just my set, but 1 unacceptable piece and 2 others that were marginal out of 4 pieces is not very good. So, if you need the unique shape or handleless cookware, these are a good bet. But if you are expecting a high level of quality control, look elsewhere."
5,The urban Gingerbread Boy story,"Set in New York City, Richard Egielski's version of The Gingerbread Boy is a treat for the eyes. The illustrations are richly detailed and colorful, and my 3 year old son loves this modern version. He and I talk about the characters and details, telling stories within the story. Our favorite illustration shows of a group of construction workers who pause in their work to chase that irresistible gingerbread boy. My son really loves the chase scenes, but the picture of the fox eating the gingerbread boy is a little scary. We highly recommend this version to readers 3 and up."
3,Gingerbread Boy or Gingerbread Man??,"This book is an OK attempt to modernize and spin off the original tale. My kids enjoyed it but kept correcting me when the lines ""...I'm the gingerbread man!""came up. My kids are five and two and kept reminding me that it's the Gingerbread Boy. SO I made my own rhyme when the lines came up: ""Hey, I'm no toy! Run, run, as fast as you can I'm the Gingerbread Boy!"""
4,Great book,The book was received in the condition listed. Fun story my students really enjoyed the story.
4,"We live in NYC, so this is a real treat!","It's great to see the Gingerbread Boy pass by people we might pass by, go places we might go (I recognize that train station, by the way!), do things that we might like to do (like climb on the scaffolding - my nieces would love to do that!).The story is just the same as the original except for the setting, and the Gingerbread Boy getting eaten... well, it's very satisfyingly written. Mmm.A note about the artwork, the illustrations are very colorful, and pretty accurate. This book is worth buying for that alone, I should think."
4,WE HAVE MISSED THEM,"Pussycat was one of my favourite groups in late 1970s. I was quite excited when I heard that this new CD would be released by late May 2000. It is a great collection and no doubt a nostalgic taste. Especially ""Mississippi"" will take many people back to the good old days of 1970s. Thanks for releasing this CD."
5,Sea View House,"What can I add to the reviews above but to say that this wasmore exciting than the first. It makes you closer to thepeople and life in Pilgrim Cove. Sea View House was full. Bothup stairs, refered to as the Crow's Nest and down stairs whereShelly and her two children would be staying. Daniel Stone andhis dog will live in the Crow's Nest. Wonderful, natural wording in her writing draws you to the lively people of the town andthe care they have for each other. Shelly become interested inDaniel and together they work for the best interest of thechildren. You will love his dog Jess.I hope you enjoy the working relationships of life in thisbook as I did.Pilgrim Cove."
5,Great Camera Any Accessory You Want,"I bought the D50 kit with the 14-55 mm lens. At the same time I bought the 70-300mm Nikkor lens designed for the D70. It takes almost any Nikon(Nikkor) autofocus lens, all of the Nikon knock-off lenses like Sigma, all of their speedlights etc.This camera takes unbelivable pictures. With the 70-300mm lens I took pictures from fair territory in the upper deck of Yankee Stadium at a night game. I have shots where you can see the ball (clearly) coming off the bat. Unbeleivable - I had to be 450 feet away at night. This was using auto exposure and autofocus.It is great for action shots. I have used it for portraits, cross country meets, and snapshots on a cruise. All come out great.I have just boght the Nikkor 28-200mm zoom so I don't have to change lenses at track meets.My recomendation would be to get the body only and the Nikkor 28-200 mm lens. It is expensive at $369, but is probably the only lens you will ever need even for sporting events."
5,"Super camera, more than just an Entry DSLR","The D50 is a solid little camera, it's versatile, works great with different lenses, low noise even at 800 ISO, I won a betterphoto.com competition with a photograph produced by the D50. The pre-sets are OK, but if you want to draw out the full potential of this camera then go manual or shutter/aperture priority.I upgraded to the D200 and now my husband and son are using the D50 for shooting, the D200 has a few extra bells and whistles but for an ""entry"" level DSLR the D50 is just perfect!I never had any problems with anything not working, it all works perfectly, produces stunning colors and super sharp images.Too bad they stopped producing the D50, what a neat camera! Can't go wrong with it! I have owned it for almost 3 years and have shot over 60000 images with it!"
5,Delightful Camera - But Avoid Sensor Cleaning,"Did you know digital SLR cameras have a little secret? Every time you switch from one lens to another dirt can get inside and ultimately on the sensor.In film SLR cameras that dirt gets carried away on the film, so it doesn't accumulate.If you want to avoid going through image degradation and sensor cleaning cycles then you may want to buy the one lens that will satisfy you and leave that lens on the camera.The standard D50 works well for me. It takes quick excellent pictures at home. Still I wouldn't mind having the longer zoom from the D70S.If you have other camera uses in mind you may want to figure out how to buy the D50 with the lens you want. You might even buy the D70S which one of my relatives loves.I have had the D50 for three months and find it to be an excellent camera. I particularly liked the April 6 review here. Remember though that this is a big camera and might not be what you want as you walk about on vacation."
1,Don't even try this ancient piece of crap from made in Thailand plastic thing.,"Just drop this 2005 ancient thing that weighs more than 2 lbs. Adorama sent me this crappy one that doesn't read SD cards, so this camera has that problem after a while, and the LCD screen doesn't have live mode which is a must after Sony A350. On D5000 Nikon is so slow and really hard to see esp. using 2x teleconverters, macro or any other manual lens with aperture. At this price, go for Samsung which has better acquarium and flower shots than in reviews, Sony with polarizer filter. For sports or nature shots or anything else, D50 is a piece of crap."
2,Not as good as expected,"Our pics taken with this camera on the first sunny days of the spring turned out very washed out and flat. They were so underexposed that later software modification on the computer could not entirely bring them to acceptable contrast. Pictures were not sharp enough. Enlarging pics to full size on the computer revealed annoying color casts similar to those seen on frames transfered from digital video tapes. camera is very heavy, not convenient for lengthy hiking trips. battery life is good though. all in all we are very dissapointed with nikon d50."
1,Mediocre product,"Easy to use, no frills camera - features that suit me just fine. The problem with this one is that shooting in automatic mode produces poor images. I was hoping this camera would replace my point and shoot. I was wrong.Problems i ran into in full auto mode:1. When shooting outdoors colors are very pale (overexposed).2. Poor contrast outdoors.3. Sharpness is very low.Seems if you want good pics you need to go into settings and set every scene individually. Why include full auto mode when it delivers nothing but terrible results? I do not recommend this camera."
4,Digital Camera,This camera was purchased for my 18 year old daughter and has been a great asset to her. Its easy to use and takes great pictures. I would highly recommend it. It also came in time for Christmas and was delivered in good shape.
5,"Fast, Accurate",Now I can take good pictures fast . Big change from non-SLR cameras I was using before. Excellent camera for the price.
5,Love my new Nikon,"I had been using a Nikon N65 film camera for years, Then I decided to go Digital. So my first Digital camera was the Kodak Easy Share, which is a great point and shoot camera, but I wanted something more challenging in Digital photography, so I decided to try the Nikon D50 which I feel in love with it, the moment I was able to take my first photograph with it. I noticed the shutter time was much quicker then with my Kodak camera, Plus I am able to take my Quantrary lens (55-300) from my Nikon N65 film camera and put it on my Nikon D50 and still get great pictures. This camera has been a real eye opening experience for me when I'm taking pictures with it. Plus there is a book on this particular camera which can be purchased at Barnes and Noble which has been a big help for me. It goes more into explaination for the use of the camera and it also has a glossary of the meanings of the functions of the camera."
5,Excellent,"I also have a Nikon D-100 digital camera and the D50 is about equal in quality to the more expensive camera. I've also used a D-70 and the D-50 is equal to this one also. The more expensive cameras have a few bells and whistles that a professional or serious photographer would fine useful, but I've used these features rarely. The D-50 is more compact and slightly lighter in weight than the D-100 or D-70.One consideration is to get the D-50 body and buy a seperate lens of your choosing for the D-50. The lens that comes with the D-50 kit only goes to 55mm; a broader range might be a better choice.Besides Nikon, Sigma and Tamron make excellent lenses for Nikons at a reasonable price. For most of us this camera will do fine and is a joy to use."
5,This camera gets the job done and more!,"I've been using this camera for a year now and for the price that I purchased it for, it's more than ample for all of my photography needs. I have many photographer friends who use the more expensive canon 20d and they have all been impressed by this camera's point and shoot auto program capabilities. It's great if you want some professional shots and are new to SLR's. If you want to see some of my work, go to flickr.com and look up spunkymort. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CAMERA!"
5,Caroline's Review,Bought my Nikon D50 in 2005 and after 6 years it quit working. I am not gentle with my cameras and this little workhorse stood up to all my abuse and still took beautiful pictures. Once I learned how to work a DSLR in a beginning photography class I was even more impressed with it's abilities and functions. The picture quality even w/o editing was comparable to other students w/ newer cameras. It's simple and easy to use with out all the flairs. I've sent this camera into repair directly to Nikon and the first time the camera worked like new and the second time it was beyond repair. I will miss my camera and seriously thinking about bidding on another D50.If considering this camera please look into getting another lens. I was not very impressed w/ the 18-55 stock lens. I was very impressed with the 50 mm 1.8 lens and the 18-200.
5,Good Camera,This camera is easy to use. I also like that ALL Nikon lenses fit (though you have to take into consideration different magnification by non-digital lenses).
4,"Great camera, but I would have liked a little more...","This is hands down a great camera, just read the other reviews. However being into photography there are two features I would like that you won't find on the D50.No illuminated LCD panel.If you don't do night photography, then you won't care, but not having this is a real bummer. Some of the controls on the camera take holding a button and turning the dial, and even if you have a flashlight you really need three hands to adjust your settings quickly in the dark.No White-Balance fine tuning.Not a huge deal, there are the presets, and you can use a custom white-balance from a gray card. However you can't fine tune it. Probably not something you'd care about if you just shoot in full auto!Otherwise great camera!"
5,Excellent!,This camera is great! It takes great pictures and the directions to use are easy to follow. Would definitely recommend this to anyone.
4,Very Nice Camera,"I'm really pleased with this purchase. The camera is responsive, it's easy to use yet has the capacity to be quite sophisticated. I haven't figured everything out yet, like whether or not you can use the screen to frame a picture. If so, it's not obvious. But I wanted a nice digital camera, and this really fits the bill. The colors are gorgeous. Now to get one of those supernice nikon zoom lenses...hmmmmm..."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I don't think SAMS Teach Yourself Filemaker 7 in 24 Hours is a very good book. Except for lots of screen shots almost to tiny to read, it does not contain much more than the manual that comes with Filemaker Pro. Its presentation is based on a few examples, but there is little about how Filemaker works or how it operates. So if you want to go beyond the examples, you don't have the information. 24 hours is not enough; I need chapters."
1,Not a good book to learn from,at least for me. It does cover the basics of the items in filemaker but all I really got out of it was a rudimentary knowledge. It was a good idea to have practical exercises that you could download from the author's website. I found that there were many times that I could not reproduce the results stated in the book. The presentation was not logical enough for me to achieve a good foundation of the fundamentals to build the database reporting project I need for work. I am now reading Learn Filemaker pro 7 by Stars and Filemaker pro 7 Advanced by Baron. These books are much clearer and enjoyable to read.
3,Give her a chance,"She's pretty good i admit, but giving her five stars would be insane, she's got some catchy tunes here, only complaint is she's following in the mould of every other 'misfit' female singer, what is the point in that, she can sing, it's the MUSIC we are bothered about, and yes the music is quite good, just sad the way the music industry has become... i recommend giving her a listen though..."
3,Two women one story,"The story of Juana la Loca is intertwined with the story of a girl who is seduced by an older man. Apparently to revive the feelings and thoughts of Juana, the miserable daughter of Queen Isabel of Spain. Although the story of Juana comes to life making easier to understand her motivations and reasons. The the second story line gave me the creeps. Neither woman is truly free. One is trapped in her society dominated by men, the other is trapped in a web of cunning created by her seducer. The novel kept me interested and all the historical event where very easy to read and follow, the second story lacks depth and passion. And most of all, love. There is not even a sexy seduction but almost a mechanical one."
3,Interesante la historia,"Belli narra la historia de la famosa Juana la loca de una forma muy interesante. La otra parte de la novela no me gustó, así que me salté las paginas para solo leer lo que tenia que ver con Juana. De todas formas la historia esta bonita."
1,JUNK,Arrived with broken wire in the tip very cheaply made. I hope to have the wire replaced but I have no way of knowing if it is German or French or just cheap China crap. I am a mother of 5 fencers I have done business with Physical Chess in the past using Amazon and ordering directly form them they sell cheaply made junk do not wast your money.
3,ehh so-so,"well. Yellowcard came back with way too much hype. the only songs i really like on this album are ""Rough Landing, Holly"", ""Martin Sheen or JFK"", ""Space Travel"", and ""Holly Wood Died"". overall it's alright, but if you're just discovering Yellowcard I would much more recommend Ocean Avenue."
4,"You'll Be Love, & I'll Be a Liar","Ok YC's L&S was not a let-down from Ocean Avenue. We saw the guys in a new light in this record, to something with immense depth. It starts off with instrumental track, ""Three Flights Up"" and ends with my second favorite song on the cd ""Hollywood Died"", it ends in the way ""3 Flights Up"" began. The guys tell you the story of a girl named Holly, everything leading up to her death. Its a musical masterpiece, Sean Mackin conducts an orchestra for the track ""How I Go"", some people don't appreciate this, but if you don't appreciate how the music is made you don't really understand it. Its not the poppy sounds of Ocean Avenue, because the guys have matured, and it shows through their music. They definatly branched out to other genres. I still am a bigger fan of their first album with Ryan Key ""One For The Kids"" but this was a good addition to their albums."
3,a good effort,"Good solid album. Not as good as some other stuff, but a little more modern rock that the first album, not bad, but not as good.worth adding to the collection, though."
5,"stop, now, take a look around at.... YELLOWCARD!","Yellowcard's new album, Lights and Sounds, is altogether an amazing compilation of music. Instead of the pop/punk sound from their last album, Ocean Avenue, they've created a real rock album that shows the true talent of the band. The mix of guitar. electric violin, and an entire string orchestra throughout the album shows how far they've come in their journey as a band. Their lyrics, written by lead vocalist, Ryan Key, give depth to the band and deal with what's actually happening in the world right now. They also show exactly who Yellowcard is right now instead of what they were two years ago. Their music changes as they do and for the better. They have recreated themselves and shown the world that they are here to stay. I think everyone should go out and buy their new album and ""stop, now, take a look around at"" Yellowcard. ""Lights and Sounds"" in stores 1. 24. 06!"
5,*****5 STARS,"I give the 5 stars of Yellowcard, 5 stars...This is an awesome album! They're just as awesome LIVE!!! This is a great album, a mix of mellow and hard rock music you can rock out to or just bob your head to while singing out loud."
2,WHAT HAPPENED,"WOW!!! What is goin on with Yellowcard...This Album is a disapointment. You cant even say that Yellowcard are sell outs, because the songs on this alblum simply are not good enough. Where is the violin sound that makes this band unique? Where is the PUNK?!! This alblum sounds like Yellowcard got together with Nickelback and started writing songs. This band should never be allowed to play at the Van's Warped Tour. ""Lights and Sounds"" is a good song...ill give em that, But the rest of the alblum simply is not good music. This is a perfect example of a band that will end up on VH1's behind the music, where they talk about how their band and thier music fell apart..."
2,Very Very Very TYPICAL,"That's all I can say really. I'm sure this album is great to every one who listens to the radio and thinks that having a political view is a fad. Yellowcard used to be my favortie band and I was actually excited about this album. To be quite honest, this album is absolute garbage overall. There are a few bearable songs, but unfortunately, Yellowcard has followed in Green Day's footsteps (who is also garbage). I guess being a political band is the popular thing these days. Yellowcard is now one of those, and I will no longer be listening to them......Great job Ryan Key!!!! Used to be Great, now you're Terrible. Thanks a lot. I'd rather listen to P Diddy."
1,being a kid these days is shamefull!! when is good music going to comeback?,"like that one reviewer said pop junk like this isnt punk rock its just safe borring crap that kids have to listen to because their parents wont let them listen to good music or they because they only listen to mtv and dont know what real rock is all about well so if you want to know what real punk rock truely sounds like in all of its raw, hardcore form then listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album and then, if you cant handle that, please stop calling yourself a punk rocker, ok?"
2,very disappointed!!,"I wanted yellowcard to come back with a top quality album like ocean avenue, instead you have a boring, plain record like this that is so underproduced, they shouldnt have bothered!! This album just sounds bad! sorry, but it does! whereas 'ocean avenue' had a quality sound to all their songs, and they were exciting, this is just boring...a disappointment."
2,You could have been so much more,"When I'm asked to define 'maturing' in a pop-punk context, my answer is usually the same; when a band gets tired and looses all their energy and emotion, they've 'matured'. When a band decides that adult alternative top 40 success is more important than pleasing a core fanbase; they've 'matured'. When time has taken it's toll and a band's members are no longer able to jump around on stage and get excited about anything, well, that band (and it's members) have 'matured'. Sucks, huh. So for all the 5 star reviewers here, I have no anger or contempt. You're probably that same adult alternative top 40 listener yellowcard was aiming 'lights and sounds' at. Boring, stodgy and middle aged (god, i never want to get old). For those of us, though, who have ever moshed to the song 'sureshot' at a concert or gotten our copy of 'one for the kids' signed by ben harper (he left, btw), Lights and Sounds is a terrible disappointment."
1,?????,"""Highly recommended for fans of Coldplay and Keane...""You see, this was supposed to be a punk band. Yeah, i guess there's nothing punker than Coldplay...IF YOU REALLY LIKE PUNK ROCK DON'T BUY IT PLEASE SPEND YOUR MONEY IN SOMETHING BETTER.If you're not a punk rock fan you'll probably find another emo band to waste your money"
4,This is a good album,"I am a big fan of yellowcard, at first I didnt like the new album but know that i've heard it a few times it's great! Yellowcard are a great band with great albums,buy it now along with the underdogs and ocean avenue!"
2,Spare Me the Emo if You Don't Mind,"I know this review will anger alot of people, but honestly all I can say is what happened? It's a sad day when the heaviest, fastest, most rocking song on your album is your MTV hit. All the descriptions for this album were wrong. For example, ""the guitars are tougher"" from this site. If you've heard Lights and Sounds or Rough Landing Holly then you know how much ""tougher"" this CD actually is.Even worse is this description I found on MusiCountry, ""Lights and Sounds is a bigger, broader album that finds Yellowcard moving away from songs about breakups."" Sure Thing Falling is a song about an ex girlfriend if I ever heard one!It's not to say that this album is total crap, but the band promised us louder, rougher, tougher, and meaner, but instead we get this load of sad sappy panty-waste.It's ok if you guys don't want to write cheerful music like Ocean Avenue, but spare me the Emo if you don't mind."
3,"Well, its different","Okay, so I'll make this quick. If you were a huge fan of YC's 'ocean avenue', you'll probably be letdown with 'lights and sounds'. It isn't bad, it isn't great, it's just different. LAS is more straight ahead rock, like foo fighters meets jimmy eat world meets nickelback. You can't call this one pop-punk, thats for sure. I suggest downloading a few songs before you cop it. That way you'll know if it's for you or not. 3 stars."
2,Yellowcard,"I dont know why everyone is giving this cd such good reviews. First off, it takes about 1 minute into the title track to realize two things. First, this cd is mixed way to rough, and it's lack of a clean mix really dosent benifit yellowcard for the type of music they play, they arent a hard egged rock band. Second, the title track lights and sounds, is pretty much the best track on the whole albumn, and even it's subpar at best. I wasnt expceting anything as good as ocean avenue, but this cd seems thrown together in a hurry, and all the songs lack the big hooks and catchy verses that made yellowcard good in the first place. Also, i wondered if they are going soft. There's a lot of pianoy balladesque songs on this record, and the rock songs have parts that just dont fit or sound really wierd. Overall, i thought this record was dissapointing and was oddly below average."
4,A different Yellowcard... but good,"When I got the cd... I was expecting songs being fast-paced and catchy like lights and sounds. I was also expecting it to be similar to Ocean Avenue... but I was totally wrong. The first time listening to the cd I was dissapointed because it wasn't what I was expecting. But just because its not what I wanted doesn't mean its a bad cd, cause its great. The vocal talent of the leader singer is amazing... and the writing talent... just amazing. These songs are a lot deeper than the previous album and it shows how they have matured as well. After listening to the cd a couple of times I found myself singing these songs later in the day. A lot of the songs are soft. But give this cd a try... and don't judge it after listening to it just once.My favorite song in the cd is Waiting... with Lights and Sounds coming in second..."
4,Solid Album!,"This is the first Yellowcard album I have, I bought it without any knowledge of who these guys are. When I listen to this album and try to figure out who it sounds like one album comes to mind, Page Avenue by Story of the Year. I liked PA and of course this album is very good also. The vocals fit the music extremly well and all the songs are put together very well. Down on my head is a great song that I can relate to but my favorite song on the album is City of Devils, this song is simply beautiful. Alot of the songs have piano and violins in them which gives the music a well rounded sound. All in all this is a great album, not every song is good but about 75% of the album is and thats why it gets four stars from me."
1,Disgraceful,"I bought this album thinking it would be as great as their past albums, and I must say say that I am disappointed. All of the songs sound the same. Ben Harper may have played on 7 songs, but this cd still sucks. This is just proof that Yellowcard is nothing without Ben."
1,1 Star Is 1 Star Too Many!,In one word? Homogenized. It lacks something....whatever could it be... Oh yeah thats right... BEN!
4,Great Album!,"Yellowcard's newest album, Lights & Sounds is simply great. It shows a huge growth in the band, lyrically and musically. With more orchestral pieces and lyrics that go beyond the overdone sad breakup song, this album will not disappoint!"
2,Jimmy Eat Green Day,"Over produced.This makes me ashamed to be a Yellowcard fan. A Yellowcard Underdog for that matter. Man oh man, give me my One For The Kids CD so I can cry."
4,Pretty good,"This cd was a pretty decent cd. The cd has some great meanings and the feelings of the songs make you feel that they are growing into a great band, and this is surely a good song. Some of the best songs are Lights and Sounds, Martin Sheen or JFK and Sure Thing Falling. The people who are complaining that this CD isn't good because it isn't like ""Ocean Avenue"", grow up because this is REAL Yellowcard!"
