1,monitor and merrimack?????,"the monitor and merrimack were both union ships.....why were they fighting each other???? i know the winners write the history books, but at the time, this fight was between the monitor and the virginia(formerly the merrimack)....."
3,Review on aussie 3min miracle,"This conditioner smells amazing!!!! I would buy it again just for the smell of it!!! I won't order it again online because it would be about 4dollars cheaper minus the shipping just go to go Walmart and buy it there. For me this conditioner worked pretty well but it didn't feel like it really helped my hair anymore than a normal non deep conditioner would. It didn't make it soft or healthier but it did make it much easier to de tangle and unless your willing to pay major bucks, thats all you really can expect from a deep conditioner. I did like this one better then the garnier frutis one that is around the same price as this."
2,Bring back the old formula,"I ws glad to see that I wan't the only one to notice that the new product is not as good as the old one. I wonder when this happens if they manage to save a tiny bit per container. I guess it would add up, but not if they lose customers. I didn't realize it until I had bought several on sale. I won't buy more after this. Potion #9 leave in conditioner works pretty well. I too have curly hair that can get dry."
3,Loved the older version better,"I am a huge Aussie fan. It makes my hair so soft and it smells so nice ( like a bubble gum- Yummy!), however this product seems to come with a new formula and I am sad to say it isn't as good as the old one. It makes my hair dry. I can only say that this is not really a good substitute for the original. Want the old one back!"
2,Reads like a multi-level marketing pitch,"I, too, really wanted to like this book because I consider myself a fairly intelligent woman. However, Estrich's sales pitch just went on and on and when she finally gets to the meat of the implementation, I thought she had to be kidding. Where is the nutritional foundation or, more importantly, a food plan that can be adhered to for life? This is another instant-gratification ploy for short-term results."
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"because I consider myself to be a smart woman! The problem is that Estrich frequently forgot how smart I am. Time and time again, she lapsed into this preachy voice and nagged me about my eating habits the same way my mother did when I was growing up.The other thing I didn't like about the book was the fact that Estrich considered herself to be huge when she was wearing a size 14--a size that the majority of women on diets would be ecstatic to reach! It's hard to relate to the struggle of someone who went from a size 14 to a size 4 when you're trying to go from a size 24 to a size 14.The book is clever in parts, but it just wasn't ""smart"" enough for me."
5,A terrific pep talk that helped me lose 30 lbs!,"I see from other reviews, that many readers agree with me. This book finally gave me incentive and tools to lose weight. If you commit yourself to Susan's plan and shtick, you will too. I think it's well researched. Though not a doctor or nutritionist, Susan has tried almost every diet herself. My diet is now almost fat free, full of fruits, vegetables, and more lean protein. I use my ""inner lawyer"" to make the case for maintaining my new thin body! It's such a kick to be thin after many years of feeling I had to accept that age and weight-gain went hand-in-hand. Working-out was not enough. As Susan says, ""You are fat because you don't eat right, and don't exercize enough for YOU."""
5,QUITE INCREDIBLE,I am currently on day 16 of her 21 day diet. I got both the book and the book on tape and liked listening to her read the book while i made notes of what was important. The book is truely incredible -- we can be so smart about everythingelse and so dumb about our own health. Making a case for yourself -- making a contract with yourself -- enjoying sticking with it because it works -- an being important to yourself feel great (the diet works too -- 16 days ago i NEVER ate vegetables)
1,Terrible Advice for Some of Us,"If you're someone who's overweight but doesn't have compulsive eating anywhere in your being, this book might (or might not) be helpful. Especially if you think you're fat at size 14. (Please.) But for many of us, her three days of unsupervised fasting and what follows - including, at some point, permission to eat anything - equals the perfect storm, a setup for binge eating. It just perpetuates and worsens an unhealthy relationship with food, and for some people, it's very dangerous.I think being smart about the law doesn't make a person informed about nutrition, wise about women and shame, or an expert on issues of weight and health. This book does a disservice."
4,Come sit in a courtroom with me and talk about foods to incarcerate,"This book is written in a collegial, humorous style. That is a refreshing change from the typical stringent, semi hysterical style of most dieting books. There is no new earth shaking revelations in the book. But the idea that I can approach food temptations in a lawyer like manner works for me. I rate it high based on the style of writing and the fact that this evokes a reasonable and relaxed approach to dealing with unhealthy food temptations(throw away that chocolate croissant in your hand no matter what you'be been told about wasting food or how the croissant feels about being thrown in the trash and it definitely is not your only pleasure!)."
5,Another great read from Teresa Slack,"If you want a good book, be sure to pick this one up. All of Teresa's books have been very good."
1,WARNING,"Do not buy if it is for your baby as diaper rash cream!!!!! The formula (and product packaging) has changed as of Feb 2011!!! I am posting this to forewarn all parents. I had been using the ""original"" formula since November 2009 and just went out and ordered 5 more 14oz tubs. Guess what? not only has the packaging changed, but the formula is totally different and WORSE!!!!It is now 30% lanolin (as opposed to 50%) and now contains a chemical called Disodium EDTA which is likely NOT good for your baby. STAY AWAY and don't buy anymore!! I'm so mad, b/c the original formula worked and i was going to use it forever. Warn your friends the formula has changed!! So important!!!"
5,WONDERFUL FOR FEET,"Put this ointment on your feet and cover with a pair of socks and you will see a vast improvement in the softness and texture of the skin on your feet, especially the heels of your feet. A very heavy ointment, they use it on animals hoofs and teets, but give it a try on your feet and you will be amazed!"
4,"Good book, could be better","This book covers the exam pretty good, it gives you the information you need. The tests are not similar with the real exam, that's for sure."
5,Nice product.,This book has really helped in making this bearable. I have really put it to good use. I recommend it to anybody.
2,Not useful,Despite all positive reviews I found this book not very helpful. I made through 1/3 of it before giving up and switching to another book. The main reason for this - I didn't feel any kind of progress. The explanations didn't really help me to understand how close was or wasn't I to the correct answer. It was very frustrating experience.
4,Great for Strategies,"This book is excellent for basic strategies for all standardized tests, and great iBT specific strategies. I used this book to teach a TOEFL preparation class. I used this book for the first portion on how to use strategies to conquor the exam, but I wish it had more examples. I had to use a separate book to provide my students with more examples.Another thing that is not as great, is that the CDs, while nice, aren't timed, so you need a stopwatch to help you out to make sure you are preparing only in the time alloted. Overall, I really like the book and the method they used. You will need to have a relativley good level of English in order to succeed at this exam."
2,Princeton Review TOEFL,"I was really disappointed to discover that the NEW book I just purchased had all the same texts as the book I purchased four years ago. No one should bother buying new books regardless of the advertising that says ""new edition"" since the publishers are just recycling the same old texts year after year."
2,NO FUN,"This book is heavy, uneasy and uncomplete and the CD is outdated. Not a good choice. I would rather recommend to buy TOEFL certified books."
4,Great technique...,"These CD's are great--I love his technique of building upon words and phrases. It is a bit annoying to hear him talk--he is kind of slow and having to listen to the other two people who are repeating the answers make mistakes and ask questions is kind of a waste of time, but all in all, I feel more comfortable with sentences now.These CD's only cover the present tense. Still, a bargain at this price."
2,We were so beloved,"This book was redommended to me. I am a German Jew and emmigrant. I am familiar with the holocaust and life in Germany in the 1930s. Neverthe less, I found this book annoying. It is written by German Jews who settled in the Washington Heights section of New York. I heard their stories once too often. They are typical of emigrants who enjoy getting together and rehashing the old times. The book is not particularly informative or entertaining even to one who has been a part of this kind of coffee hour often. I would not recommend it."
3,Expected More,"I've been trying to build up my Belmondo collection (AKA to complete it) and his comic-action performances have always been my favorite. This one, however, left me unsatisfied -- too much schtick, not enough coolness."
5,Oakland Raiders Dominoes,I purchased these as a gift for an Oakland Raiders fan that loves playing dominoes. He absolutely loved them. Very classy product.
3,I don't know if it was the topic or the organization...,"This is a confusing topic as is, but I felt like the authors did not do a great job in making distinctions, and also that their topic headings and cases could have been better organized. For those of you who rely on the table of contents and preface paragraphs to the particular legal theories to help you study, this book will give you some difficulty.Good choice in cases though."
2,Good at first but eventually stretches,"This glove worked great at first. It fit well and provided good grip but after several uses, it eventually started to stretch and became loose around the fingers. I'm going to look for a glove with fabric that'll stay consistent though use."
4,Good CD,"My daughter is a huge Wiggles fan and enjoys this CD. It is different from their other songs I have heard, just like some other reviews stated. I think you either like it or hate it...we like it. My daughter is 23 months and wants to listen to it every day. We have not seen the video and still enjoy the music."
1,Wiggle Bay: Very Gay,"This is the worst wiggles album ever made. Going way over the edge on the experimental level, the wiggles try to hard to make new characters out of the same characters. Do not buy for your kids; instead get ""Yummy, Yummy"" or ""Shout At the Devil"" by Motley Crue."
5,A2zcds.com has preserved this timeless Hollywood classic on DVD for generations to enjoy,"""Hats off to Ida Lupino - one of the gutsiest females to grace Hollywood's male dominated studios. Her handling of her cast in `The Bigamist' is just as effective as her handling of directors when she faced the camera. Always in control of her sets as she was of her life, Lupino seems to have brought a refreshingly new and characteristically feminine perspective to this classic, which is a must watch for all her fans and her detractors - if any! """
2,Not ReMastered,"I just received this DVD. This is the first time that I have seen this film all the way through. I enjoyed the film very much, and would recommend the film itself too anyone. It is of the Film Noir Genre. Ida Lupino was a very talented Woman, both, as an Actress and a Director. As for the Non Quality of the DVD itself, it is terrible. The product is advertised on the site by the Seller and Amazon as being ReMastered. This is Bull, it is false advertising. This version of this film is in No Way ReMastered. I Do Not recommend that anyone purchase this version.The Bigamist (1953) [Remastered Edition]"
4,Happy Customer,"The product was shipped in a timely manner like promised. I am very pleased.Thank you,V"
3,Naughty AND Nice!,"I'm not always crazy about EJD's writing style, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I don't know how he does it, but he is good at writing from a woman's perspective."
4,Naughty or Nice,"'Tis the season to curl up with this quick Christmas tale, so grab a cup of hot chocolate or cappucino. Eric does his usual great job of tapping into the lives of us sistahs. He has once again captured the heart of the basic need to reach out and touch someone.....and it is really all about, ""the end""."
4,Interesting,"""Naughty or Nice"" is the story of three sister, Frankie, Livvy and Tommie. We are taken into the hearts of these young women as they struggle to make sense of their lives, their shattered loves and the loss of their loved ones.The sisters draw strength from past memories of their beloved mother and father and even though they might not want to admit it, they learn how much they need each other, and how deep the bond of sisterhood goes.At times this book is quite spicy and intense as we invade the lives of these sisters, and the author shows that in a family each can be different, with different needs and desires, however, the end result for them was a deeper commitment to one another and understanding to what is important.Sex, love, hate, and life all tangled up in this steamy read, unraveled for the reader as they learn the bond of sisterhood.Shirley Johnson"
3,"I love EJD, but....","I just didn't like it. My first EJD book was Cheaters I read that and fell in love; since then I've been reading all of his books in order of publication: Sister Sister, Friends and Lovers, Milk in My Coffee, Liars Game, Between Lovers, Thieves' Paradise, and the Other Woman. Over all I enjoyed all of the books but this one just didn't hit me. I usually back up my obsession with EJD by saying that I'm reading his books because they all have depth and meanings and that with each one I learn a little bit about myself; but I just can't say any of that about this one. Usually after reading one of his books I want to know more about the characters, I wonder about what they are doing what happened later. The characters in this one just didn't do it for me; I could care less what happens to them. The book wasn't horrible it just wasn't what I've come to expect from EJD. It would have been good from another author but when you pick up EJD you expect great."
1,Very Disappointed,"Whenever I go to the bookstore, the first thing I do is check to see if EJD has any new books. I would buy the book without having read the synopsis at the back. But i must say, this book didn't quite do it for me. The best thing about this book was the pretty cover. The book ended and I was like what did I waste my precious time reading. Go buy The Other Woman now, that's a good read.This is most definitely not his best book."
3,"Interesting, not remarkable.","I rarely find EJD's characters very empathetic. I thought his ""Holiday Tale"" might resonate more with me, remind me of family ties and love and sisterhood. But I didn't understand a single thing about these women, and I would not recommend this book to my sister. The book is basically a bunch of drama. If sex, lies, and betrayals aren't your thing, you won't like the book."
2,Not a Christmas Tale,"I am still undecided as to if I am a ejd fan or not. This book was interesting though it was slow making it difficult to continue reading. i feel that ejd's books may be geared more to an older audience (i.e. over 30) than myself. I enjoyed the drama and the suspense that was evident in the story, though I would have liked to see more suspense, etc. I t was an okay read. I will be reading more ejd books...i just don't think i have found the best one yet."
3,"Easy Read, No EarthShattering Wisdom","This book was a nice and fast paced read. I finished it in an afternoon, in a single sitting. I was really rooting for the youngest sister Tommie, but did not really connect with the elder siblings Livvy and Frankie.But at the end of it all, I don't think there is any great divining wisdom to be gained from the characters. In fact if I had to summarize, I would say it is a cautionary tale against internet ""hook ups""."
2,Just not good,"Had some good sex scenes. But I had no sympathy for the characters. I really didn't care what happened to them. I just finished the book to be done with it. The stupid twist at the end wasn't even exciting. Still didn't care. If you want to read a good EJD book, read ""The Other Woman."""
3,Just Okay,"This was my first EJD book and at first I regretted buying it. The beginning was long and drawn out. It seemed like he was just trying to fill pages. I think he over did it with the highway descriptions. I am from Birmingham, AL so I couldnt relate. I could care less how crowded the 110 always is. I was beginning to wonder if I was reading a novel or a map. However, it started to get better towards the middle. The ending was great. However, I would have appreciated more detail about Tommie's past relationship (in relation to the scar on her face) and the beatdown Tony put on her ex. I give this book 2.5 stars (just alright). I really look forward to better things from this author. I heard he has better books."
5,"Funny, Light and Easy Read!","EJD has done it again! This is a quick, easy and delightful read! The McBrooms sisters are all characters! If you want a good laugh read this short but sweet story! Livvy, Frankie and Tommie are all lovable characters."
3,It was OK....,"I thought this book was ok.The book talked more about Livvy than it did Tommie and Frankie,her other sisters.I feel that the author didn't give much information on each sister.I guess Livvy felt like 2 wrongs would make a right because she ended up hooking up with someone on the internet but in the end she got surprised alright.In my opinion it started out kinda slow but it picked up in the middle on towards the end."
3,That's it!?!,"This book didn't give you enough description of each sister as an idividual. You don't really get to understand why each sister is doing what she's doing,no background. It wasn't a bad book but i think if EJD would have given you more and a completed ending it would have been a much better book. The book didn't live up to the title to me. But read it for yourself, you may feel different."
3,Naughty or Nice,"It took me a minute to get into the story, but once I did I enjoyed. I love his man's writing Technique, with him you can never tell. Naughty or Nice is one of my least favorites, but I still enjoyed this book overall. I look forward to reading more from EJD, he's my favorite author. Readers also read Friends and Lovers if you have not this is my favorite book."
2,Disappointed,"I just finished this book, and I must say...I am truly disappointed. This book sucked...the way it ended was terrible. Although some of the book was interesting, I found myself waiting for the book to pick up...well it never did. Not EJD's best work. I sure hope the next book is better."
2,Confused Sisters,"I was not impressed with this novel by Dickey. It kept going on and on and on and on. As I was reading I wanted it to hurry up and be over. I usually can't put his books down, but this time it took everything I had to finish Naughty or Nice.I was disappointed with the behavior of the sisters. I wanted to tell them to get a clue.I still want to read The Other Woman. Hope this one is better."
5,Naughty or Nice,"Eric proves that he knows what he's doing everything he touches turns to gold and this book is gold no matter how slow you read or how tired you are you will stay up to finish this book the characters wont let you stay away they will keep you laughing woo woo woo, crying and wanting to kick somebodies @$%^. Naughty or Nice is exceptional buy it,give it as a gift you'll be happy you did i know i am happy i got it"
2,Not what I was expecting,"I am a BIG EJD fan, but I have to let my opinion be known. I bought this book as soon as it was released and was very disappointed. The story unfolds very quickly, too quickly. The characters tell you how they feel instead of you, the reader, being able to read and interpret how they feel like most good books do. I like to sit down and read and think about the characters and put them together and with this book I couldn't. I like a book that makes me think.I really believe that this book was put together too quickly and that is why it wasn't up to par. I believe with a little more time it could've been so much better."
3,An OK Holiday Read,"I was glad the Mr. Dickey went back to his multiple first person story-telling for this book. I had missed it is his later endevors and was quite frankly getting tired of the no-name main character thing. Unfortunatly not all of the characters were well developed. I found myself skimming of Frankie's story to get to Livvie and Tommie's. It would have been a 4 star book had I read it earlier, but New Years had past and the characters were still Christmas shopping. I found myself waiting for the book to end. And then dissappointed by the weak undevopled ending. My suggestion: Make sure you read it in December and finish before the 25th. Pick it up if you're looking for a light read. It won't really take your breath away or anything."
1,Very disappointed,"I am one of the biggest EJD fans. Whenever he comes to town-I'm there. Whenever his new book comes out, I buy it the same day. This book was too raunchy and not enough substance.The ""flava"" , the characters, the dialogue found in his earlier works were not there. Hey Eric-how about a sequel to Cheaters? Still loving ya.."
3,a chick book,"Naughty or Nice is an easy read about the McBroom sisters and their romantic relationships .Coming together to celebrate Christmas,each hopes she can help the other with her problems.From Frankie's humorous Internet dating ,Livvy's hot (...) relationship to Tommie's tender love affair, there is something for everyone!"
2,Not one of his best.....,"I have always been an Eric fan from day one... but this book.. didn't quite do it for me. Usually I CAN NOT put his books down! But this one I have managed to put down on many of occasions...Its ok, but its nothing to write home about.The Other Woman on the other hand...Now that was hot...I think thats been my faviourite so far.This one just didn't do it for me."
2,Umm disappointed,"EJD introduces us to the McBroom sisters, who in the midst of living their own lives find a way to remain a part of her siblings life. I enjoyed the closeness of the sisters as a unit but individually we were cheated.This is the first time I felt no affinity for the characters in a EJD book. I am very disappointed that we were left with no real description of Frankie, Livvy or Tommie. The storyline had alot of potential but I could not get beyond the fluff and missing substance. Also we were promised a holiday novel - what happened?I was very disappointed in this bookMissy"
4,One of the best super spicals,Very good. It was suspensefull and I like that in a book. it tought me to apprecaite more things in life GOOD JOB ANN!!!!
4,A fun and exciting book,"I really like this book and the fact that it's so exciting and fun to read, but I kind of agree with the person who wrote the May 1 review. The book was very dramatic, but it didn't seem to have much of an impact on Dawn and Claudia. I know this souns a little silly, but later on, in the Friends Forever super special ""Everything Changes"", Claudia writes to Stacey that she's never been stuck on an island before. That's a very minor thing that only a few people would catch, but it struck me as odd; I mean nobody would forget a traumatic experience like that.Other than that silly little nagging incident, the book is great. It's a real page-turner and Claudia and Dawn and the rest acted logically for the situation. It's fairly realistic and everyone's response to the disappearance of Claudia and Dawn made sense. Overall, a fun book."
2,did not like this Super Special,"I am a huge fan of the BSC books, and have read all of them many times. Although this one is well-written, just like the others, I found it strange, unconvincing, and out of style for this series. I thought it was really dramatic, and that it was a good story, but maybe not for the BSC series. This incidence, (being stranded on an island) would be hugely impactful in someone's life, but none of the children or baby-sitters involved seem to be affected in a big way. And it is only mentioned a few times in other books as ""that time they got stuck on the island"". I just found it strangely out of style for the series."
4,"Seemed to help a little, cheap alternative for tinnitus","Cheap alternative to other lipoflavanoids for tinnitus. I only gave it 4 stars because the bioflavanoids are only ""50% active"". If you have tinnitus I highly recommend you see your physician, or ENT as it could be any number of things. Good luck"
2,Didn't work for me -,"I have read several times where bioflavonoids are supposed to be a natural remedy for tinnitus, so I purchased these. After three weeks of taking two a day, no relief at all. But they might work for someone else, so I'm not going to knock it. It was worth a try."
2,8 in of love,"for me, This product does work. It does have a great taste, it just does work. the price was very cheap off the web, Henry's or Sprouts's carry this product for a even lower price."
3,"Not as good, but timely","I am a huge fan of Barbara Wood. This book was disappointing.I think Barbara discovered the Internet, and was a bit tooenamaored with it- the computer aspects become tiresome.However, the storyline which ties the Net, the Millenium, andreligion is a good one. Her book 'Domina' blows this one awayas does 'Virigins of Paradise' and 'Green City in the Sun'-she does historical fiction wonderfully."
3,A little too transparent,"I like Barbara Wood alot, and I suspect her novels have been giving the stricter Christian sects fits for several years. She is at her best when tilting at the windmills erected by religious institutions, although the doubts planted by her words may often have the opposite effect intended by creating fantics out of formerly passive worshippers. The villian in this book, however, needs work. It became apparent from the start that the computer mogul Miles Haver was modeled after Bill Gates. Perhaps if Mr. Gates' picture wasn't such an icon in itself, Ms. Wood could have gotten away with it. But a bad guy who looks like Alfred E. Neuman (even if mentally only!) does not do much to scare me. Hey, wait a minute! I just previewed Office 98. Maybe I spoke too soon."
3,Again and again,"I've read a lot of Barbara Wood's work, and like the title said, it's the same plot, again and again. As a woman, it's good to see books with a strong female caracter, but this is too much. I have noticed that in almost all of her books, the plot is as follows: a)some weird artefact shows up b)the heroine is in danger c)here arrives the knight in shinning armour d)they both end up winning the day (with some forbidden romance) e)the heroine had some family conection with the artifact The only thing that changes is the setting, which is well described."
3,"at times interesting and provocative, not always though","I liked the way she wrote the scrolls. The bad guy didn't make sense to me. The Las Vegas scene in the maize and pool was rediculous. For some strange reason, now my friends all want to read it as they are curious about the scrolls."
1,A total waste of my time,"This book is the silliest piece of nonsense I've encountered in a VERY LONG time. The writing is sophomoric and at the level of a discount-store romance novel. The author seems to know very little (nothing?) about the Catholic church and church history. I stuck with reading the entire book because I thought it might be amusing in a B-movie way (something so bad that it's funny), but the book isn't even worth the time on that level - it's boring and predictable. NOT RECOMMENDED!"
2,Too predictable,"After reading a couple of chapters, the story turns out to be the usual romance tale. I can more or less figure out how it's going to end."
3,Too Many Quirks,"I enjoyed the last 1/3 of this book much more than the first 2/3s. The author made the main character much too quirky (practicing life without the use of body parts, imagined illnesses, conversations with telemarketers, serial fish killer, embarassing neck rash, and more). Maybe a couple of those oddities would have been funny, but all in one person definitely seemed like overkill.The book does get better towards the end though so if you have started it, it is worth seeing through."
2,Ummm. naahh,It was a good try though. The book starts off with the strong character of Sammy with all her quirky traits and interesting habits but in the middle of the book her quirks suddenly become not so apparent and she turns into every other girl. Stories okay but not really a recommended read.
2,"cute, but no cigar","This young woman has quite an ego. I saw an interview with her, and she described her own novel as ""great"" while talking about a movie deal.I wish. I'm looking for comic novels that are truly funny all the way through. I think it's hard to do, especially if you're relying on the quirkiness of your character to bring in the laughs, and especially if you write over 220 pages.Quirky and cute, yes but after a while tiresome, this character is. I lost interest in her at about page 120, with 200 more to go. So then I've got to rely on the plot, which is not that compelling or believable. And you've got to have good plot when you've really only got a 2-D character, however quirky and endearing."
4,GREAT BOOK - BAD POLITICS!!,"Definitely a book along the same lines as Bridget Jones! Gotta say - I like K Gore's literature much better than A Gore's politics. Thankfully, other than for some transparent jabs at the current administration, the book is bipartisan for the most part. The consistent blunders of Samantha Joyce, the heroine of the book, are vastly entertaining. As a true chick-lit fan, this is great chick-lit!!!"
5,Loved it!!!,"Kristen Gore is a wonderful new voice in women's fiction -- her character of Sammy Joyce is heartwarming, believable, and laugh-out-loud hilarious. Ms. Gore's insight into the inner workings of Washington is right on target, and she skillfully blends this knowledge with relationships, family, and feminine angst. I can't wait for the next book! Please, more of Sammy!"
4,An American Bridget Jones,"This book made me laugh out loud, just like Bridget Jones did! Sammy is a young, overworked, and slightly crazy staffer for a Senator she thinks is the last moral man on the Hill. The novel takes her on a year's worth of adventures as she makes her way Blackberrying through romances and accidentally revealing her intimate romantic details to the DC press core!!! This book was so funny and clever that I cannot believe it is Gore's debut novel. Cheers to her and to Sammy! I hope to hear more of her adventures in the future!"
3,new career for vp's daughter,"SAMMY'S HILL is the first novel by Kristin Gore, daughter of out most recent vice president. Gore has been a writer for Futurama and Saturday Night Live, and it shows as this story of a young Senate staffer's professional and romantic travails is filled with wacky comic details. I wondered if Sammy Joyce's boss, a senator from Ohio, was modeled a bit on Gore's dad. Senator Robert Gary is well-respected, a bit stiff at first, but a dedicated public servant.Quite a bit of the story is taken up with Sammy's romance with Aaron, a smug speechwriter for a rival senator. Aaron is a bit too obviuously a cad, and we sort of root for Samantha to wake up...Sammy does find love at the end of the novel, but it's a litle rushed at book's end....Funny, sincere, optimistic, SAMMY'S HILL is a novel that makes me want to hear more from this author.... recommended"
3,Good debut novel,This is a funny novel and I liked idealistic Sammy. The jams that she inadvertently got into kept me wanting to find out what was going to happen next. I liked how Sammy dealt with her problems and managed even the most embarrassing situations with spunky charm. My only complaint is after awhile it started to drag. I think it would have been a better story if it was a little shorter.
4,"Funny, Quirky and Engaging!",I got lost in Sammy's neurotic and amusing world of Washington politics! Witty and charming all the way!
4,Wonderful First Novel,I read so many good reviews of Kristin Gore's first novel and I was not dissapointed. Not since Bridget Jones' Diary have I found such hilariously quirky characters. I found myself laughing out loud at several parts and was reluctant to put the book down. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a light read and a good laugh.
1,A Total Waste,"This is nothing more than utter tripe. It is not worth the time, the money or the effort to read. The author appears only semi-literate and the story is totally lacking character development. Gore is clearly a narcissist cashing in on daddy's career and contacts. Don't bother."
4,A laugh-out-loud entertaining read,"As a 55 year old man this isn't the normal genre I read, but as an admirer of her father I was curious to at least read a little of Kristin's book. Little did I know that I was about to be thoroughly entertained by the antics and world of Samantha, the main character. An impressive first novel, and a hilarious read. The most fun I've had reading a book in quite a while. Highly recommended!(Note: I suspect the sour grapes review here is a conservative who can't read the book with an unclouded view due to the fact the President in the book (who is a minor part) sounds an awful lot like you know who...)"
4,A highly enjoyable and light read!,"I agree with the others that this is a sort of ""Bridget Jones on Capitol Hill"". However, while Sammy is clumsy and quirky ala Bridget Jones, she is much more intelligent and together (at least in the job department). Yes, she is very quirky, but I thought her quirks were quite funny and make me like her all the more - plus, it is fiction, so I kind of like when the authors take their characters a little over the top.Being a huge fan of the romantic comedy, I am hoping they make this into a movie."
4,Breezy Charm on Capitol Hill,"Kristin Gore has penned a likable novel in Sammy's Hill. Samantha Joyce, the heroine, is an attractive 20-something who serves as a policy aide to an Ohio senator.Sammy's quirks are legion-- she worries incessantly about contracting exotic ailments, has trouble caring for her Japanese fighting fish, and nurtures friendships with telemarketers. And yes, she becomes embroiled in numerous romantic confusions of the type that one might expect of a young, smart, but slightly naive Senate staffer.This novel works because of its goodheartedness and the sympathetic portrayal of its heroine. As one might expect, Gore (the daughter of former Senator and Vice President Al) also does a nice job with the Capitol Hill setting and the depiction of a presidential campaign.Recommended as a light page turner that will serve readers well on planes, beaches or after a difficult day."
5,"Fun, witty, interesting . . . Looking Forward to a sequel!","Loved this book - fun, witty, refreshing. Kristin Gore has a great knack for making the incrediably absurd seem so plausible."
5,"Best ""chick lit"" book I've read","Despite the title of this review, I almost hesitate to classify this book as ""chick lit"" as I think that somewhat denegrates it. This is one of the funniest, intelligently written and heartfelt books I've read in a long time. I laughed out loud at least once in every chapter. I received ""Sammy's Hill"" as a ""secret santa"" present from a colleague who knew me to be an avid reader. It was one of the best gifts of the holiday season. I just wish Kristin Gore would publish another one!"
1,Trying too hard...,I kept convincing myself that this book was going to get better. Instead it was just one cliche' after another and it seemed like Kristen Gore was throwing everything she knew in this book hoping some of it would be believable- or funny. The result however is a flat story that should have been written as a screenplay instead of a novel. At least I know now know that I won't be seeing the movie. I've already seen Bridget Jones' diary and Legally Blonde and this novel is obviously trying too hard to be just like them.
1,Pretentious,"I couldn't relate to the character, really. This book is for those who are into politics and frequent the bar scene.A 'Brigit Jones' of DC is not the same as Brigit Jones of London. It's better to stick with the real thing. This book is more like a substitute. It will only go as far as being compared to something else."
2,Not As Funny As I thought It Would Be,"I'm a Republican, so I have no use for the politics of the Gores. However, being a big fan of the television show Futurama (which the author wrote for), and political fiction, I thought I'd give this a try. I gave it as much of a chance as I could. I hobbled through the first 150 pages or so before putting it down. Maybe I had trouble reading it because I have trouble relating to a main character who is a woman. Maybe it's because she's a writer on Saturday Night Live, and I find SNL to be compltetly lacking in himor these past few years. Whatever the reason, I can't bring myself to pick this book up again. I probably will one day, when I've read all of the other books that seem to be piling up next to my desk. I have a feeling that it won't be any time soon, though."
3,"Fun, easy read that is frustrating at times.","I liked the premise of Kristin's book and I found the characters endearing. However, I agree with a previous reviewer that Sam can be unrealistically quirky at times, what with the imagined illnesses/disabilities and bouts of hypochondria. On the other hand, it makes her more ""human"".Still, the book was an enjoyable, light read. The political/personal issues brought up are issues that everyone can relate to. The ""side"" characters were also interesting and so loveable. I'd recommend this book to anyone who's into chick lit or is looking for a beach read!"
2,Not a fan,"I like the Gore family, even voted for Al in 2000, so I really wanted to like this book. It was weird, though, and the humor was forced and it just never took off. I wanted a Bridget Jones goes to Washington and instead I got a bizarre, rambling, mess.Skip it and read a Jane Green book instead."
2,A Bridget-Jones-wanna-be,"Although the book at first kept me interested, after awhile I realized I read this story line before. It is closely modeled after the much better-written book Bridget Jones: the quirky, funny, awkward-yet successful girl falls for a gorgeous man who seems perfect in every way but has an underlying mystery and untrusting way about him. She ignores all the signals of his bad-ness and as the story unfolds she realizes what a total creep he really is..... meanwhile, the guy who is ""perfect"" for her is right under her nose all along and she mistakenly thinks he has done her and others a terrible injustice when in fact it was the ""creep"" all along who was behind these acts. Forget this book, read Bridget Jones - it is much funnier and original."
2,"Boring, forced, and unsatisfying","Sammy's Hill lacked a compelling plot (or any real plot for that matter) and the insecure, over-analytical personality of the main character made this book highly unsatisfying to read. Despite my attempt to approach Kristin Gore's book with an objective point of view, perhaps it was my political ideology that had a subconscious effect on my negative opinion of her book."
5,Excellent read,"Kristen Gore wrote a fantastic debut novel. My sister recommended it and I am SO glad that I borrowed it. I could not put it down! The main character, Sammy, is written so well. I felt like I could relate to her at times. She is funny and sensitive and has an exciting job working for a senator she really believes in. Her life is stressful, complicated and she is surrounded by interesting characters. I recommend this book to everyone. It is worth reading and sharing."
5,Great Read,"I started to write a review after reading the excerpt in Glamour magazine, but decided to hold off on judgment until I read the full book. I was not disappointed. This book is hilarious, funny, and friendly. I could easily relate to it through myself or my friends, the lead character suffers from about every neurosis I had ever heard of it and describes everything perfectly. I would recommend it to about anyone...although it is almost like a chick flick in words...it was wonderful."
1,"It's not what you know, it's WHO you know....","I (tried to) read the lengthy excerpt in Sept. Glamour Magazine--that was more than enough! The first few silly paragraphs were so poorly written, it was painful to continue. Three words will explain why the book was ever published: ""Al Gore's daughter."" Enough said."
2,Poor writing,Sammy's Hill caught my attention in the first pages when the slap stick Senator's aid was practicing to use her left arm in case her right arm was eaten off by a tiger escaping from the zoo. After that it was all downhill. The writing was trite and took pages to get to the point. The characters were shallow and the inditement of many of our political leaders was thinly veiled. Reading this book was a waste of my time.
5,hilarious!,"Kristin Gore is amazing. Sammy's Hill is by far the book for a good laugh. Samantha Joyce is the kid you made fun of in high school. She is a little too busy for her own good, at one point she unintentionally ends up in two mismatched shoes... completely mismatched, a bright red tennis shoe and a sandle. She is a little neurotic, such as she will do her everyday routine while wearing an arm sling, just to prepare for life without her arm, if it ever happened. For the girls out there, you can count on a love interest. This book will literally make you laugh out loud."
5,what donna from west wing might have written!,"For anyone who is familiar with the west wing, I suspect this is much like reading an autobiography of Donna. Like Donna, Sammy is dedicated to her boss who is a democratic leader, her wit will make you laugh out loud, and her folly will have you rolling on the floor laughing. Loved every second of this book and couldn't put it down."
2,A test of will,"This books is a test of the will, as well as one's desire to become anything like a linguist. If you picked up this book to gain an understanding of assyrian in a sense of fluency, well, there are reasons this book only costs eleven dollars. I have never seen another easily accessible guide to assyrian, and was forced to buy this book for want of a competing volume. It is arranged poorly and one gets the impression it is the product of some editor stealing an assyriologist's notebook. It reads like an archaeologist's private joke, and could turn many people off to the language as a whole. Another word of caution: the triliteral roots used in the back only make sense if one has a solid grounding in ancient hebrew. My own skill at the language is spotty, at best; I eagerly await a better volume for instruction in what I cannot deny is an overlooked and fascinating language."
1,Worst book in my library...,"This is by far the worst book in my library. It should actually be entitled ""How to put off Anyone from Learning Assyrian"". I bought it because I found it - untouched - in a used book store. It was untouched for a reason. Unless you are already fluent in Semitic languages, particularly in Ancient Hebrew, it is entirely worthless. The dictionary is ordered according to Hebrew letters, thus making it virtually unusable. The cuneiform and transliterated texts don't match. The grammar is written for hard-boiled grammarians. Then again, it does look good on a coffee table and will baffle your guests. Unfortunately, it will also baffle you..."
2,An Anime Classic for all the wrong reasons,"The Premise is typical of anime. Kids are elected to fight aliens. BUT one of these girls is a cry baby, not just a cry baby but she's so weak she makes Bella from Twilight look strong. In short Alien Nine is Frustrating I found myself screaming at the TV for Yuri (the main character) To just DO something all she did was cry and let her protector helmet do all the work.The Election process for the Anime's ""Alien Club"" is never fully explained but why kids would choose somebody so timid and weak to protect them does not speak well for said process and the end is a mess, just some whale like alien and more crying.The Art, Premise and theme song are all good but I have never seen an anime where I hated a character so much because of their own weaknesses. Shinji from Evangelion was braver than Yuri YEAH!.If you are curious check the show out, if you are easily frustrated or have a background in Psychology look elsewhere."
4,Alien 9 + Manga,"Alien Nine is a great anime for all of the reasons mentioned in previous reviews. However, when it stops after 4 episodes you are left hanging. What were these four episodes about? Why were people acting so strangely? Nothing really made any sense. I was fortunate enough to buy the Alien Nine box set which included the 4 episode DVD and the 4 volumes of the manga. I watched the 4 episodes, read the 4 manga volumes and rewatched the DVD. Everything now made sense. The used copies of the Alien Nine DVD can be bought very cheaply. I would buy one of the cheap DVDs, watch the four episodes, and then read the manga online (just type in ""alien 9 manga"" in your search engine and you will find several places where you can read all four volumes of the manga in English translation).The four DVD episodes are just the tip of the iceberg. The manga contains the real story which is quite original and well told.I subtracted one star because you have to read the manga to understand the DVD."
3,Cut off,"There are only 4 episodes. It would be a good beginning of an anime, but it quits just as things are getting started. It's ok, as far as it goes, but don't bother unless you like to see only the first 1/4 of a movie."
3,Good with manga,"The animation in Alien Nine is beautiful, both the dub and original voice acting is fair, and the music is strange yet entertaining. It also makes a very nice addition to the manga (term for a Japanese comic book). By this statement, I mean that the movie essentially NEEDS it's manga counterpart to feel like an entire series. The episodes just cut off with next-to-no hope for another volume, which tends to be the style of many Japaneses animes, which are normally intended for a Japanese audience that always has easy access to manga. This anime isn't for everyone, it's a very interesting mixture of cute people and grotesque aliens that they have to fight with exploding-green-alien-blood-and-guts results (think the Men in Black movies ). If this isn't your cup of tea, or if you aren't intending to read the manga, then I'd suggest steering clear. Otherwise, I would definitely suggest seeing it. It's a funky, fun addition to the wonderful manga series."
1,JUNK-IN-A-BOX,The one star is for the pretty box. The new machine inside was dead-on-arrival. Called Canon for help. They spent twenty minutes trying to help and gave up. Invited me to accept a refurbished model in exchange. So much for public relations. Returned unit to store for full refund. Will not deal with Canon again.
4,Cannot Use With Windows 7 (64bit),"I have used the MF3110 for several years and have enjoyed the laser printing qualities.However, I just bought a new computer with Win 7 (64 bit) and per conversation Canon thisprinter will not run with this OS, nor do they plan to update the drivers."
2,Reasonable performance but durability lacking,"The performance of the MF3110 is okay (especially for the price) but I found that the durability was lacking--my died after 5 months and it would cost more to ship it and get it fixed than to buy a completely new one. Also, the output is not the sharpest compared to other b/w lasers."
3,"These are cute. The chips are a not that big, good for a casual day.","These are cute. The chips are a not that big, good for a casual day.I thought the were going to be bigger and better quality chips."
2,Less than inspiring,"I bought this CD because I thought it would be a good refresher on the French I learned in high school. I also thought that since I have been known to sing along with the radio or even to myself that I would be singing along to the songs on this CD. Unfortunately, I found the music less than inspiring, and I also doubt that one would learn much if you did not already know some French - the CD jacket has the words of the songs but nothing else. This CD definitely lacks joie de vivre. Good idea but poor execution. I feel I wasted $18.00."
5,A complete statistical history,"Great book. I have a few editions written by Neft/Cohen covering the NFL from 1960 through 90, 93 and 98 but this book goes all the way back to the beginning. In depth statistics, capsules and rosters for each team in every season from 1920 on. Capsules of championship games from 1933 foward along with additional playoff games in subsequent seasons was thorough. It has enhanced my library of NFL reference books. I highly recommend it for all fans interested in the complete history of NFL football. It arrived promptly and is in terrific condition. I love it."
3,The Compassionate Community,This is a thought-provoking read for everyone. Perhaps we would not be in the pickle this country is in if our leaders had read this book. It is not too late--Amazon please send a complimentary copy to one of our leaders who READS! Neva M. Sullivan
4,OLIO 's gonna ROCK YOU,"Mixture of Funk/Pop/Soul, Olio is an underrated group that deserves your attention !For lovers of Terence Trent D'arby or Prince, it won't disappoint you.Moreover, these guys are really cool.DeHaven on drums keeps it funky ;-)"
3,"It's good, but not worth what I paid for","As a fellow belly dancer, I love Rania. BUT, this video was not worth the money. She does a drum solo at the end, that is actually Jillina's (If you want to see a pro - get Jillina's DVD set). Her performances are much better at the end of her (fitness)other videos. There is, however, a great tummy section, and she does break down some of the moves well. I just don't think it was worth the $35.00 I paid for it."
4,very good,"I liked this video, especially the workout part, because I enjoyed the style of putting combinations together and actually dancing while working out. The music is very good also. The reason I didn't give it five stars is that, as a beginner, I felt that Rania maybe was under budget or time constraints, but she was trying to fit too much instruction into the warm up. I had to rewind several times to learn the travelling steps. Once I got past the warm up, I really enjoyed the workout, and eventually could do it without looking. The Step-Twist move is great for the waistline."
2,Que horrible!,"I can't believe *I* spent money on this! One of the worst belly-dance videos I've seen, and I've seen quite a few. Rania is stiff. No flow there. Her background dancers always seem to be better than she is. And who filmed this one for her? Her husband? The camera moves back and forth and in and out at such a rate near the end that I became seasick. Plus, how is anyone going to learn the steps if the camera is constantly focussed on her enhanced breasts? I was very diappointed in this video and found it unusable and a total waste of money. If you want better instruction and better quality better to go with Dolphina, the twins, or Suzanna del Vecchio's tapes."
1,Purchased another video by Rania not on Amazon yet,"You might want to second-think carrying this video or any others by this woman...she is beautiful and sexy, but her dancing is laughable...which I would have done, exceptI actually paid money for this video. This is one of the worst instructional videos I have EVER seen! Two of the background dancers are MUCH better than the ""instructor"".The Veena & Neena videos are high quality with only a couple of questionable techniques...the ""Goddess"" instructor is a yoga person who took a few bellydance lessons...she sucks at bellydance. The Rania videos are a rip-off to the dance community. Even if I knew nothing at all about bellydance (I've been bellydancing for 25 years),I still would have been horrified by the stiff jerkiness of this woman's dancing. She has no business passing herself off as an instructor."
4,Superb 50's Jazz,"This is a great album. Baker's voice and horn are each superb. ""I've Got That Old Feeling"", ""There Will Never Be Another You"", and ""Let's Get Lost"" are each worth the price of the album.If you like sweet, smooth jazz, this is a great example."
5,The original recipe,"Paul Paray was one of the first conductors to go back to Schumann's own original orchestrations of these symphonies. Before that, many a conductor had tweaked and fiddled with the scores to ""enhance"" the melodic lines -- and also to ""heavy them up"" in that stereotypically Germanic manner. Perhaps it took a Gallic conductor like Paray to treat Schumann's delicate-yet-vibrant scores like a watercolor rather than an oil painting. (Paray, hearing one of Schumann's symphonies performed with a doctored score, was quoted as saying to the conductor after the concert, ""Nice piece. Who wrote it?"")Paray is most effective in Nos. 1, 2 and 4. The Rhenish is not quite as special, but certainly OK. Nothing like the travesties you'll hear with Solti and the Vienna Philharmonic. Like others who have reviewed this CD, I also hear the high-pitched whine in the 4th symphony. It's not unbearable, but why couldn't the engineers have gotten rid of it?"
5,Useful Book!,"When you are looking for something to add to the shiny guitar under the tree, or the thrift shop 5 dollar guitar, look no further than Mr. Baldwin's book. He's been in the music biz for a long time and knows how to work with beginners- and this book will help anyone sincerely looking to learn the basics with a great instructor. Mel Bay, move over!"
4,Near perfection!,"This DVD includes the videos for Girlfriend, Bump, Bump, Bump, Gots to Be, Why I Love You and the alway fabulous Uh-Huh. There are actually three versions of the Girlfriend music video on this DVD. I would have given it five stars however the Bump, Bump, Bump video features too much of Puff Daddy. Way too much! It's more like Puff featuring B2K instead of the other way around. You won't get tired of watching this disc, though. The guys look fine as always, their gear is banging and their moves are tight. You'll love it."
5,CHECK IT OUT,"This DVD is excellent for B2K fans.If you love em,check this dvd out.If you dont....well,we all luv em dont we?I dont own this yet but my friend does and we watch it all the time,so i recomend 5..no 500 000 000 stars!I guess im just B2Krazy"
3,"Not bad, but not great either","This was a fairly good overview of the first world war, but I was very dissapointed that it never even mentioned the Canadian victory at Vimy Ridge, one of the key battles of the war and very little mention of Paschendaele, one of the bloodiest battles of the war, but used nearly one entire disc on the American contribution."
3,"Even for a 21 fan, this was a disappointment","I'm a big fan of Chicago from 21 onward, but even this was a disappointment for me. I don't even listen to songs 1-6, but rather 7-end. The first six I think or sort of lame songs but the horns are introduced further on in the CD, which is what I like.I was looking forward to this after the previous billion CD's released were just compilations of previous songs issued over and over again. Not thrilled about it, but it's an ok CD."
2,"""derek"" is absolutely spot on","the first half of this cd is pretty awful then all of a sudden robert lamm appears and Chicago discovers some of its jazz/rock roots. the second half of the cd makes it worth buying but wait till you can get it cheap,which it will be in a couple of months !"
3,30 Years begins to show...,"I love Chicago. They flat out are my favorite band. I love the early years with CTA-Chicago 8, I listen to what people consider the [...] era with 12-16. I like the Scheff years with 17-21. This being their first release in ten years, I was hoping for a little more new material, not a poor shadow of what Chicago 19 was. Don't get me wrong now...I'm a big fan of the scheff years, but this is not a step forward or even a stance in the same spot, it's a step backwards. I thought a lot of the songs were very uncreative and unoriginal, and like I said I listened to Chicago 12 and 13. I'm hoping for a real return to glory soon. I'm not saying this album is bad, just not Chicago quality. There are some bright spots. Walt, Jimmy and Lee make the horns sound awesome, and there are a few hot charts, but it's the ""love"" songs that really stand out to me as uninspired."
2,I dont reccemend buy this cd at all,Chicago this misses by miles from there previous work from 1980-2000 yr. that was chicago at there best. Id say get Peter Centera back with the group or at least for a reuion tour at least to save your caeers. Dont but this cd. It has no more than say maybe 4-5 good songs but they dont match the fire the groove as they did in 1980-2000 yr. Be aware fair warning. George Bretz
3,Chicago's 30th Album,"Chicago XXX is the band's first straight pop record since 1991's Chicago Twenty 1. Despite the fifteen year gap, the album sounds like it could have been released that same year. Keying on the power ballads that were a staple of the late 80's and early 90's, the band plays to their strengths. ""King Of Might Have Been"" is strong ballad that is faintly reminiscent of ""Hard To Say I'm Sorry"", ""Caroline"" has some meaty guitar riffs and ""Better"" is accentuated by the classic Chicago horn sound. Only the album's opener, ""Feel"" which has a spacey trip hop beat, strays from their tried and true sound."
4,Bring on XXXI,"I heard ""King of what might have been"" on the internet and it was one of the most wonderful songs I had heard in the past ten years. I looked up this CD and listened to the other 12 songs and I was sold. The CD starts with 6 slower songs. I generally do not like this idea. The difference here is they are all good songs. The 7th song is ""90 degrees and freezing"". This takes you to the faster side of Chicago. Good stuff. I would have given it 5 stars but the faster music doesn't have the good hooks. All in all, its a Chicago CD that has a taste of the 80's style, 90's and today. There is nothing wrong with that. The guys sound great! I cannot wait for the follow-up."
2,LAME - BORING - PLEASE PUT THIS BAND OUT OF ITS MISERY,"I can't stand this any longer. 37 years I've been following and loving this band. This CD is terrible. This is pablum. This is just awful. Please kill this band and let Robert Lamm's solo work take center stage like it deserves. Or fire everyone in the band except the four originals and start over with a new name, new concept, new blood. Sad, sad, sad."
2,A disappiontment,"It's 15 years since Chicago's last studio album 21 was released (except for their Big Band album and Christmas album which was released inbetween), and I had great expectations for Chicago's new album called Chicago XXX. I was disappointed. It is much sound here, but very little substance and good melodies. The best songs on the album, in my openion, is the single Feel and the second song on the album; King of Might have Been, feautering Joseph Williamson on background vocals. Buy Chicago 17 instead if you want Chicago at their best."
4,Take me back to Chicago !,"I am so glad to see that Chicago has not given up on releasing new material and that they still have the ability to produce some great music.This is really a very solid release and in my opinion the best since Chicago 16.The music is fresh and at the same time very familar.My only complaint is that there are no tunes penned by the members of the horn section( James, Lee, Walter)that offer a contrast to the more pop/ballad offerings of the other material.Even so,this is a very strong Chicago release and should not be missed."
3,It's About Time!,"I own each and every Chicago album on CD, and it's been a LONG wait for this one. It's a pretty good CD, but it's not what I would call great. After Robert Lamm's last solo CD, I expected more in the way of jazz-influenced tunes, but there's a lot of pop ballad stuff on here once again. These guys are pros, so the sound and playing are top-notch. However, I am REALLY offended by the fact that track one, the ""Hot Single"" track, completely leaves out the horns; track thirteen (""w/ Horns"") is the same song with some horns added. Here is a band whose reputation was built on its horns; are they embarrassed to release a ""hit"" track with horns? That's a real slap in the face for long-time fans of the band. Walt and the guys must be offended by that move!"
4,Exactly what it's supposed to be...,"Don't purchase Chicago and expect Winton Marsalis. They have always been an adult oriented pop group, and since the 80s they have established a successful sound and formula for strong, funky and enjoyable music. It is exactly that, with high production values, plenty trademark horns and memorable melodies. Not a ground breaking album, but an excellent effort for anyone that enjoys this genre."
4,Still Tight After All These Years,"Another disc of solid musicianship from the current lineup of Chicago. Gone is the syrupy, smoky haze of stellar production by David Foster, Humberto Gatica, Chas Sanford and Ron Nevison. I'm not saying that like it's a bad thing, as I loved Chicago with heavy production but Chicago ""Stripped"" still shows what a great bunch of musicians these guys still are and always have been. Little to no processing on instruments or vocals [there are a few verbs, delays and keyboard/sequencers/loops, but if you can find them, they're ALL the way in the back] this is a solid bunch of songs accomplished only as Chicago can do them. Four out of five stars because I wasn't dazzled through the first listen, but I did have a smile on my face the whole time. Standout cuts: '90 Degrees and Freezing', 'Lovin Chains' & 'Feel'. Thanks guys - as always it was worth the wait!"
1,sappy music for the lovers and pop populus,"I guess I'll never hear another Chicago II, III, or V again. I even liked Chicago 17. There was still enough rock and upbeat jazz (We Can Stop The Hurtin; Stay the Night; Along Comes A Woman). Oddly enough, sap songwriter Cetera leaves the group but the sappy stuff not only survives, but it dominates.No more jazz. No more R & B. Just pop music for the masses.Since it's been 15 years since the last ""new"" release, I guess I'll be dead (or close to it) before the next one. As far as I'm concernced, their best work is way behind them.So long Chicago."
2,OK - But not classic Chicago,"I agree with a previous review - start at song 7 till the end and you are as close to CTA as you can get. At least you can hear the guitar. The band needs to find a blues/rock guitarist that knows how to use a ""wah-wah"" pedal - and then maybe they can get back to the classic CTA sound..."
2,The Time Has Come - SORRY,"This is a prime example of a band hanging around (like the Stones & Springsteen), because they can. Put out an album & they think it will work.. NOT SO HERE. I have seen these guys numerous times with the Beach Boys & a long time fan (CTA days).This album has maybe 2 songs worth putting on my IPOD - Where Are You? and Already Gone. The rest you can put out to pasture. Please, some weird stuff here - 90 Degrees and freezing & Come To Me, Do.. What the heck was Lamm thinking about. Better yet, what was RHINO thinking about. Time to hang up the horns boys...."
5,Fantastic,It's about time Chicago came out with new materail. They have kept true to their name and keeping up with their horn section. Keep up the great work Chicago.
3,"It's The Mix, Stupid!","I don't know. But is it that no one can mix in this age of all things digital? I'm not going to comment on the songs themselves since that's been covered. But man, listen to the older recordings, they jump out at you. This is so ""one dimensional""...flat. Give me a 24 track Studer and a ""analog"" engineer anyday!"
3,Chicago XXX,"This album Chicago XXX is okay, not great, but Okay. The first song ""Feel"" is probably the best one on the album (CD). I think I have most of the Old Chicago Albums, and still listen to them. It will be hard to beat the first album Chicago Transit Authority as this will go down in history as the best of Chicago...."
1,I don't get it...,"...these guys moan and complain about being pigeonholed as corporate/ballad band and then they release something like this. And why do they need 5 other keyboardists and guitarists when you have Robert Lamm, Bill Champlin, and Keith Howland in the band? When you listen to a pre- CHICAGO 16 album you know pretty much who's playing what. I've heard that they are coming out with a new album in 2011. Let's hope they get back to the basics and be great BAND Chicago."
3,Too Many Ballads,"There is a looonnnnggg stretch of ballads right after Feel that gets a bit tiresome. Each song individually is good but one after another after another... Maybe if they had put the songs in a different order? It gets real boring. Too much Jason all over the place.Best Song: Lamm's 90 Degrees and BurningI generally love all of Bill Champlin's stuff and like Better and Already Gone.I think the best Chicago album in recent memory was Lamm's Subtlety and Passion, the second best is Bill Champlin's . That is what a Chicago album is supposed to sound like.I think ""If you leave me now"" was the worst thing that ever happened to Chicago. They've been trying to clone that ballad success for so long that they forgot most everything else they can do."
4,About time,"Nicely done collection of new material from Chicago. I could tell that Bill Champlin's influence, knowledge, and creativity has been infused into this new materia. And that's a good thing. Very enjoyable CD."
5,Fantastic resource of legitimate information on Gen. Custer,"Being a relative of E.A. Brininstool, I know first hand what length of detail and accurateness went into this product. Earl spent many months/years on interviews, pictures, and fact finding on this compilation. I would recommend this to anyone looking for accurate information on the Custer Battle."
4,good for overall trial picture & circumstances of the trials,"This book spends a good deal of time introducing the background of the trial, and in my opinion does a good job of providing a bird's eye-view of the trial, but does not get into specific legal arguments in detail, if that's what you're looking for. Perhaps, the transgressions of the accused are obvious to many people, but I'd still like to know what they were charged with.Overall, I found it somewhat informative, and it lists all the people involved in the case. Also provides a good variety of trials, ranging from that of Socrates to the current period.I'd recommend this if one's not looking for book going into great (legal) depth of the trial and its circumstances, especially if you're looking for something that's more like a light read with lots of info!"
5,Canon 85mm f1.8 lens,"I bought this lens to use on both my Canon Digital Rebel XT and film EOS 650 cameras. It gives excellent results for both, and is the sharpest lens I have ever used. It is perfect for middle-distance shots in available light, such as photographing actors on stage from the audience (first row recommended!). It is less useful for portraits but I have had good results in that situation as well. While it may seem restrictive if you have only used zoom lenses, you will be pleased with the results."
4,85mm 1.8 is a No Brainer,"This lens is as sharp and produces vivid colors on par with the much more expensive L-Series lenses. For the money, it's a no brainer. I bought it for portraits, yet I find myself using it for just about everything other than sports due to the limited focal length. Now if you have a few grand in the budget, than the 85mm 1.2 is the best option but the 85mm 1.8 is worth every penny."
2,"Great as fiction, but . . .","I have read this entire set and they are excellant reading in general. The way Mr Jacq portrays Ramses was very unrealistic, he was a god in his own right but the man was still human! It seemed throughout the 'books' that Pharaoh was ""perfect"" and ""could do no wrong"" but the characters around him were flawed. I think this five part ""saga"" would have been more believable if its main attraction had showed some frailties along the way. For example. the relationship Ramses has with his wife, Nefertari appears to be untouchable. What married couple has a ""problem-free"" relationship? I understand these novels were created for entertainment but what about just a little realism. Overall, its a good story and worth a read, even if the characters are shallow."
2,"After the first 3, the 4th is quite boring and redundant.","As the series progresses, more and more 'mysticism' becomes the driving force behind the book, thus getting further and further from an entertaining, perhaps educating, story.Also, the constant regurgitating of facts for a reader that has not read the previous ones wears thin.The series should have been 1 book--I think the author's profits or delusions of a 'saga' series ruined it. I can't read the last 50 pages--I'm completely bored."
5,Ramses: The Lady of Abu Simbel - Volume IV: 4,Great story! I enjoy reading about ancient Egypt.This rendition from Christian Jacq is as entertainingas I hoped it would be.
5,Great- but wordier than the other books,"I have read the first 4 books now, and it seems that this edition is a bit wordier than the last few, perhaps because of added mysticism, as opposed to the previous action-oriented books. I cant wait for the finale"
4,Fascinating true historical romance,I have read all four English traslations of the Ramses series and this one is every bit as good as all the rest. I will be very happy if volume 5 introduces some new characters though. I highly recommend starting at the beginning of the series to get full benefit of character development.
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I ENJOYED THE PRIOR BOOKSIN THIS SERIES VERY MUCH. I WAS INTRIGUED BY THE COMPLEX PLOTS AND SUB-PLOTS. AFTER KEEPING THEM GOING FOR SEVERAL VOLUMES, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE HOW THEY ARE ALL RESOLVED IN THIS VOLUME IN SUMMARY FASHION, AS IF THE AUTHOR BECAME TIRED OF THEM. THE RESOLUTIONS WERE UNSATISFACTORY AND HIS DESCRIPTION OF MOSES AND THE EXODUS WAS INACCURATE AND OFFENSIVE."
1,Absolute rubbish!,"I didn't realise this was book four of a series when I picked it up. Not to worry, it is so bad I can't read beyond about three or four chapters, and for me that means that the book is just abysmal. Thank the lord I didn't buy the set of them! To be avoided like the plague, it is one of those books best enjoyed by the fire - as it burns!"
1,Poor service from Amazon to Australia,"After searching for this CD, found several at Amazon. Amazon would not ship the new CD to Australia. Some of the second-hand ones were exorbitantly priced. The one that I ordered never arrived. At least my credit card was refunded. Eventually purchased the work elsewhere."
1,Dead Zone Series,"Has potential, but like so many shows, you can't hear the dialogue for the background noise. Sound effects wayyyyyyy too loud, Music wayyyyyyyy to loud. Wish movies and tv were the way they used to be. I pretty much watch this show on mute, cause I can't understand what anyone is saying anyway, and don't enjoy the deafening music and sound effects. If Amazon had encoded CC, this may have been a four star, don't see five."
5,The Dead Zone is pure Gold!! Television at it's Best!!!,"You don't really need to review something this cool! All I'm going to say is that if your not watching The Dead Zone on USA then your missing the best TV show since the Early X-Files. Stephen King, the Pillers, and Anthony Micheal Hall have re-vamped the Dead Zone to a series that should be ruling cable television.--Jonathan Leonard (Third season Please!!)"
2,Got the 1st season but.....,"The Dead Zone - The Complete First SeasonJust to give you an FYI. I got the 1st season of Dead Zone with the booklet that goes with it, but to my disapointment, it had 2nd season discs in the box set. When I went to check the lineup for the 1st episode online for the 1st season, it should have the title ""Wheel of Fortune"", that's the one when Johnny wakes up from his coma, and not ""Valley of the Shadow"" (from 2nd season / 1st episode). And the 1st season should have 4 discs in the box set not 6. I don't know how a box set titled for first season got mixed up with second season discs in this set. Who dropped the ball on this one when the box set was made? I am making arrangements to return it because I have the second season box set (black box) that I ordered from another vendor via this website. Heads up to the vendors: double check your packages and your info before sending them out to your customers. But be prepared to prep up refunds and returns.Thank you,Andrea A"
5,Dead Zone - A Real Winner!,"This series is inventive, engaging and highly entertaining. I'm sorry I missed it on television. I highly recommend this series to anyone who wants some quality programming. I can't wait for season two to be released. I hope those people keep up the good work."
5,love it!!!!,what more could anyone ask for great actors good stories a good premise a hero that makes a difference in the world using only a litte bit of violence recomend enjoy
4,Good entertainment,The storyline of this series stays fairly well constant. It is a story of good against evil and good seems to win. I enjoy almost everyone of the stories.
3,missing guide and incorrect info,"The show itself is great, but the package is missing the episode guide. Also, some of the episodes are out of order on the dvds. I found other guides online so I could watch the episodes in order.The package also says there is commentary on all 13 episodes; I can't find anything other than the special features.I hope the other seasons are packaged better."
1,"Plausible ? A stretch, Sci_Fi more like it....","Kinda funny how people want to believe we are more than we appear to be. I don't believe that, what you see is what you get..... I kinda cringe when people look at a show like this and say ""plausible"". I think ""possible"" is a real stretchhhhhhhhhh.... This could have been a good series if it had put the money into writing and lost all the over the top sound effects and head busting music. Gotta wonder what those sound people were smoking or shooting....."
2,Very Disappointed!!,I was very disappointed with this show. I don't care for shows that use the Lord's name in vain....I will not purchase anymore..
2,I love the movie but...,"Movie is fantastic...but this tv series is one boring catastrophe. Pacing is very slow, episodes are not even original. Episodes 1 & 2 are of the same one as the 1st dvd version they so called ""unaired pilot"". I cant believe that they would even copy the story from that fantastic 1957 movie ""12 Angry Men"" and make an episode out of it. Only 2 stars for 2 episodes worth watching."
3,Don't buy the pilot,"I've just bought season 1 and the pilot episode as the previously reviews helpfully said that season 1 didn't include the pilot. What they didn't say is that episode 1 and 2 of the first season ARE the same as the pilot episode. So if you are buying the box set of season 1 you don't need to buy the pilot, it's the same as the first 2 episodes."
3,Not the same quality 10 years later,"I chose to buy this product again 10 years later because my first tent crate is still in use without any problems with frame, fabric or zipper. The new portable crate has a base that made different & it remains to be seen if it will give great service like its predecessor."
5,One of the most slept-on lyricists of all time,"An absolutely brilliant album. Cyco (note the changed spelling, in place since the ""Blacc Plague"" album) provides some of the most disturbing and timely social commentary ever heard on a hip-hop record--he has an incredible flow and incredibly complex and insightful lyrics. A true head would put Cyco's storytelling brilliance on a par with Slick Rick and, obviously, Scarface (of Geto Boys fame). However, while the Geto Boys, which are an obvious comparison, seem to self-destruct with their anger and only Scarface's (and Big Mike's, when he replaces Willie D) lyrics on-par at all times, Cyco provides incredible subtlety and restraint. An absolute must for hip-hop heads--regardless if you're a backpacker, beathead, or gangsta."
5,Infectious,The beats...the lyrics...the delivery...all top notch. The original horror-rap band set the standard here. The songs are infectiously catchy and memorable. Cyco's voice is perfect for this style. This is a classic that never got the attention it deserved.
5,Perfect map!,This map is wonderful! We only spent 2.5 days in Paris and this map helped us save a LOT of time by not getting us lost! We walked everywhere and saw lots! I would not have found all the short-cuts without this map. Pretty handy. And folds well.
3,decent map,"The maps are okay, but the format is bothersome. the very southern and northern parts of the city are cut off, and you have to flip the map over and upside-down to reference them. Also, some streets are missing. However, it does provide a good guide for the city, with metro stops marked clearly, and landmarks printed large and in bright colors."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I needed to add on a few dollars to get the free shipment for my books, but the map is very difficult to read. It fails to clearly show the subway routes. I have seen much better maps of Paris. It is also nicely laminated, but too large to carry!"
1,Absolutely useless,If you are a tourist this map may be adequate but for finding your way around Paris it is a disaster. Entire neighborhoods are completely left out.
4,Handy and durable,"A friend recommended this map, as she had used one for a trip to London. So we bought one for London and one for Paris. Both were handy as we toured the two cities. With both street and Metro maps, conveniently sized, light weight, and durable, it was the only map we needed as we navigated the crooked streets of Paris."
4,Very useful map to us!,"Really liked that the main monuments/attractions where drawn, including the train map. The downside for us that cost the lost of a star was that we stayed at the Marriott on the South side of town and it was not in the map. Other than that, highly recommend this for first time Paris visitors like us. Oh, we had 1 1/2 & 8 y.o. boys with us, and we thought this map made it easy to look up thing quickly."
5,great products,these maps are great for city center and heavy traveled areas near city. Be sure to review them before you leave to be sure they cover the area you will be in because they are mostly city center and heavy traveled areas near city. these maps are compact and easy to carry while traveling in city. they also have public transit information so you have it all in one easy to carry fold and laminated map. Did not use for driving but why drive in Europe? I would buy these for all my city travels.
2,A Little Too Large,"While the content of the map was great, the size and lamination would not allow it to fit into my purse. Actually ended up carrying the paper brochure map around from the hotel the whole trip, which also allowed for circling destinations easier."
3,"Great street map, not a great metro map","This was a great map for getting around Paris, but I would recommend using a different map for the Paris metro - it didn't integrate the street & metro maps very clearly, which made a few of our metro stops a bit unfortunate & our walks a little longer than anticipated. For the money, it was a good purchase & was the perfect size to take with us everywhere."
4,Excellent map,"This is a very well-done map. The hard-format is particularly welcome. Good index. One drawback is a confusing map of the Paris Metro system, not the classic, easy to read map you usually see."
5,Getting Around in Paris,"This map is very helpful, folds easily into compact shape, is laminated to protect it and enabling you to mark on it and is easy to read. I love Paris and this map makes it much easier to explore new things in Paris."
1,Waste of money,"Unless you plan to visit only the very center of Paris, this map is useless. If you want a map that covers all of the city, includes maps of the metro and bus lines, and fits easily in your purse or backpack, wait until you get to Paris and buy a ""Plan de Paris"" (a detailed pocket map) from any newsstand or bookstore."
5,Map That Works Brilliantly,"Free maps of Paris are plentiful, but maps that are accurate and easy to use are hard to find. This plastic map is the BEST for the tourist in Paris. Fits in a man's pants pocket, it is easy to use and fold. Plus it has the metro system map and the stations are on the map so one can find them!"
3,There are better options.,"I ignored the reviews complaining that this street map does not have a wide enough scope. I figured that it being my husband's first trip, we would mostly stick to the main attractions in the city center. I was mistaken. This map is so limited that it does not include anything outside the 6 central city zones. It does not even include the Pantheon. It does have its advantages, however. It includes a metro map, and its lamination prevented much wear to the map over our week excursion. Regardless, I would have gone with another option if I had to do it over again."
5,Streetwise Paris Is a Real Winner,We use Streetwise maps whenever possible when we travel and find them to be the best we've run across. I love the fact that they are sturdy and laminated and don't fall apart. They are clear and accurate. The Paris map has the Metro/RER insert which is handy when you want to travel light and don't need all the information of the full route maps.You can't go wrong.
5,Perfect companion,"We recently embarked on a trip to Paris, and brought this and the Insight Fleximap of Paris. Streetwise was always the one being used. It folds out lengthwise so you don't have to struggle with it. We just found the area we needed and folded it to size. Perfect.It also had most of the tourist locations we needed and was easy to use. We won't go back without this map. Since it's laminated, you never have to worry about it getting wet.Also, you'll eventually end up navigating the metros when in Paris, and this was handy for that too. We needed to know where the various gares were, and thankfully this map makes them stand out in blue. You also have your arrondisements clearly noted.I would recommend this to anyone."
2,Only for those with spectacular eyesight!,"The map itself is well done and easy to carry but the print is so small, it's virtually impossible to read unless you're in bright light and have great eyesight! Am returning it.Streetwise Paris Map - Laminated City Center Street Map of Paris, France"
2,Paris Map Laminated,"We preferred the tourist map the hotel gave out (and at the airport), over the laminated Paris map since the tourist attractions were marked better (easier and quicker to get our bearings)."
3,Not what I expected,"This map has some great reviews, so I bought it expecting it to be perfect for our limited needs. I was pretty dissapointed. First of all, it was very difficult to decide which area of town I was looking at becuase they were not separated by colors, lines, etc. There were also no markings of taxi stations, which didn't bother me until I had spent an hour trying to find one. Who knew you couldn't just catch a cab!? Noting these would have been a BIG help! I would only recommend this map if you plan to use the metro or rent a private car."
2,"better than nothing, especially in the rain","This map is just not precise enough, cutting off streets and portions of Paris. You have to flip it to get to the other half of the top and the bottom. Great for a rain hat, but you're better off getting a complete map of Paris from any hotel there."
3,Pretty decent map,"We haven't taken it to Paris yet, but have been studying the map. It is quite sturdy and folds easily to fit in a pocket. It's not too big. It's fairly easy to find things on the map, except for the way they have the sections divided from one side to the next, which is a little confusing."
2,covers major attractions but very incomplete city map,"Paris has 20 arrondissements, this map covers only those in the center. 12, 13, 14, 19, 20 arrondissements are completely not covered, 15 and 18 are partially covered. If you needs to navigate beyond major tourist routes, this map is not sufficient."
2,Doesn't cover all of Paris,"I was dismayed to find that this map doesn't cover Paris to the Peripherique. If you are planning to visit Montmartre, for example, the northern section of this arrondissement is omitted."
2,Streetwise Paris Not really whay I expected. Not that great,Streetwise map of Paris isn't really that great. Not what I expected at all. Overall the map is not the detailed map that I wanted.
3,This map covers all,This map covers all one need to know to move around town plus the Metro stations are very useful and easy to read.
5,Great help in Paris,I mutilated the metro map from the hotel desk. This laminated map was a great help in locating where we were and where we were going. Love it.
3,Limited yet detailed,I hope to adventure out to places this map will not take me. The layout is very much East / West and I am frustrated by having to flip it many times when planning a North / South adventure.
3,Durable,Handy and durable but only covers the central part of Paris and leaves out too much of what you may need.
4,Content Colorado Cattle Dogs,"We started using SuperJuice on our cattle dogs and quickly saw healthy responses in both the puppies and Lil' Bit, the mother who is age 11 and still actively working cattle. Both the pups and the mother had healthier coats and overall better health and energy. We've been highly pleased with SuperJuice and strongly recommend it to all dog-owners as a must have on the shelf."
4,the world needs pop,"all in all a good ,hook filled cd.people who like this cd should venture into some harder ,similar territory and check out some of the stuff by enuff z nuff....or remember nick gilder;another killer kanadian hitmaster popgod-worth a listen;especially the album that contains hot child in the city circa 78-79."
5,"ty's work is very unique and original, i can listen 4 hours","i bought the cd for she's so high, but fell in love with IF YOU SLEEP. i grew up in the 70's on bread, beatles,lobo, seals and crofts..etc. TY's style sparks a new age of music..alot of strength and meaning is put into each song...and each song sets off a different mood..i enjoy listening often..ty's music is history in the making . i am sure he will be around a long time ."
2,You ain't seen nothing great.,"The only real reason to have this CD is ""She's So High"" which is an absolutely infectious pop hit which I've sung solo in the shower more than once. For awhile I didn't know who did the song, but I found out and luckily got it for only $5.99 at a large retailer. I say luckily because it's really a CD single with lots of useless junk filler. I personally didn't like one other cut one this CD. That's only my opinion though.My suggestion, buy it used here for the best quality you can get for the smallest expenditure. You may be disappointed too because there ARE no more She's So High masterpieces within. I know that I always resent buying any CD that doesn't have at LEAST 3 or 4 great cuts. That said, BUYER BEWARE."
3,"Lightweight, but enjoyable","It is quite clear that Tal Bachman is a Beatles fan. The influences of the Fab Four are so obvious here that copyright lawyers may want to give it a passing listen. The bright side is that one can do worse than draw inspiration from the Beatles. Beyond the hit single ""She's So High"", Bachman has produced a strong album of catchy, well-produced pop songs. Hooks abound, guitars jangle, Bachman croons away purposefully to great success. In the end, it's a lightweight affair, but a very enjoyable one."
4,Son of Al Stewart?,"Listening to Tal Bachman brings to mind Al Stewart (""Year of the Cat"" and ""Buy Me a Ticket on the Last Train Home Tonight""). His vocal range is impressive, especially when hitting the higher registers."
4,Michael Penn-alike,"I definetely agree with the earlier reviewer who suggested Tal Bachman was the best new voice since Michael Penn. If you like this CD,I can unhesitatingly recommend Michael Penn - Resigned, or Neil Finn - Try Whistling this"
5,EXCELLENT CD!,"When I heard She's so High I just had to get the CD. Today, I listened to the WHOLE CD three times. After you listen to the rest of the CD, She's So High becomes an okay song compared to the rest of the CD. There is a song for every mood your in. A lot of the songs have different styles which make the CD very enjoyable. You just can't get bored of it. Tal Bachman's songs are very large in variety and range. If you thought She's So High was addictive, your gonna be addicted to a lot more somes. If You Sleep, Romanticide, Looks Like Rain, and I Am Free are some of my favorites. This CD is really excellent. There should be at least a few songs for everyone on this CD. For me, there are so many good songs that I can't really make up my mind on whats my favorite"
5,This is a Great CD!,"Tal Bachman's self titled CD is wonderful. I have never hear greater music. I first heard it off Dawson's Creek and since that episode came out(Nov.) I have been looking for this CD everywhere. My favorites songs are ""If you Sleep"" and ""She's So High."" I love the way his voice sounds and the tune of the music. I hope that his CD gets very popular. ""If You Sleep"" and ""She's So High"" are Grammy material. I highly recomend this this CD. Now I have to go because I am about to buy this CD. Joshua Brazelton"
2,Starts well then fades away,"I was somewhat disappointed by this album, especially after all the positive reviews I read on this site. The first song is great, as is the second (""She's so high"", the hit which made me think I might like the album). After that everything gets a lot quieter, and I can't find another song which really stands out. I appreciate the musicianship but find some of the melody lines rather over-complex. The sound is often really seventies, from the tone of voice to the use of guitars. Not that that's necessarily a criticism. What is needed is a few more lively tracks!"
5,TOTALLY AWESOME,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BETTER CD'S ALL AROUND THAT I HAVE PURCHASED IN A LONG TIME...HIS VOICE IS TOTALLY CHANGING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CD. STRONG ENOUGH, ROMANTICIDE AND DARKER SIDE OF BLUE ARE MY FAVS ON THIS CD. EXCELLANT BUY"
5,No one can even compare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Tal is my first and only artist I have ever LOVED!!! His cd is so well done that I have loved it from the very beginning to the end. Each song is so well done...my favorites have to be Darker Side of Blue, She's So High, If You Sleep, I Wonder, Looks Like Rain, You're my Everything, I Am Free.....They are ALL so well done that I could never and I mean never grow tired of it. This is one of the few cds that I have that I don't skip any songs. I listen to them all because they're all hits in my eyes!!! Keep it up Tal! You're the best and no can compare to your ingenious work!!!!!!"
5,its really good!,all i have to say is BUY THE CD! ya wont be sorry every song is good! i heard shes so high and went to buy the cd 10 mins later im glad i did!!!
3,A great album!,"I rated it a 3 because I'm very picky, but it is a great album. His melodies are so well-crafted and his lyrics are genuine & full of feeling. He sounds like a mixture of John Lennon, ELO, Anders Glenmark (Sweden), yet he is original. Some songs have hooks reminiscent of masters such as ABBA, the Beatles, and the Beach Boys."
4,Good solid album,"I liked ""She's so High"" when it came out, but I never heard his entire album until today when I borrowed it from a friend. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that it is a good, solid album. Unfortunately Tal seems to have fallen into the same trap that Duncan Sheik and Shawn Mullins fell into. One decent turn of the century hit for an earnest singer/songwriter which got overplayed at radio and overshadowed any possibility of a follow-up hit.I am not sure I agree with some of the reviewers who seem to think Tal is heavily influenced by ELO. There is some similarity on songs like ""Romanticide"" and ""You're my Everything"", but those songs are also reminiscent of Badfinger, and quite logically The Beatles and George Harrison's solo efforts which inspired both ELO and Badfinger. But there is also a Dylan-esque quality to ""You Don't Know What It's Like"". All-in-all, Tal draws from many different influences and makes them his own. The sign of a true artist."
5,"Bought it for ""She's So High"", love the rest!","I originally bought this CD because of the song, ""She's So High"". I love the rest. Tal Bachman has a great breadth of talent and skills that make this CD a joy to listen to. BUy it!"
3,Fades at the end,Obviously driven to buy this because of She's So High and that song is worth the purchase...however I get through the 1st 5 tunes and think it is excellent and then it fades...it loses what edge it does have and becomes soft..the 1st half makes it a worthy cd though
3,Pretty nice and unique album.,"""She's So High"" is a wonderful tune. Tal has a very unique voice, not at all like his father's. It took several listens through to really begin to enjoy and appreciate this album, but it is now one of my favorites, along with Marty Stuart's The Pilgrim. (How's that for diversity?) Buy this album, get in a dark quiet place, turn up the volume and enjoy!"
5,Great CD!!,"I have a friend that takes me to practice and he put in this cd and I thought it was awesome! I loved every song on it. If you are thinkking about buying this cd, BUY IT!!"
4,Glossy hooks throughout,"""She's So High"" got lots of airplay, but sadly limited to the secretary-rock ""Lite Hits"" stations, it seemed. It's a shame, since Bachman has plenty of hooks to bring to classic rock afficionados.The album is glossy from start to finish, which you'll either love or hate."
3,Not Exactly a Rocker,"So I hear She's So High a while back on the radio. It attracts my attention and I rush out and buy it. The disc starts off well. The first two tracks are great, but it seems a bit downhill from there. I kept searching for that She's So High sound and it's just not there. I don't mean to imply that this album is bad, it just doesn't carry the rocking sound throughout. Keep a cup of coffee handy."
4,I hear John Lennon,"Tal is very talented. You hear the sounds of John Lennon in a few of his songs. I truly hope that he won't be a one-hit wonder. Most songs are solid and beautiful. There are a couple of weepy tunes. What amazes me is his range. Some songs are very slow, others are like rock. Very interesting and worth while!"
2,One Hit Wonder,Tal Bachman is just a one hit wonder. He sounds like a girl. He makes the weirdest videos. His song She's So High is okay.
1,The only good song on this album is she's so high,I didn't like any other of the songs. They were just dumb and pointless
2,low sound and poorly made,"I agree with the other reviewer here that the low rattle sound that it makes doesn't really get the baby interested.Also after 3-4 months (my baby is now 6 months old), the lower part or chin part of the elephant rattle...the stitching came off. Therefore the cotton or whatever material is inside is now showing and coming out. I won't give it to the baby again because baby might choke on this fiber fill or cotton filler."
3,Very quiet rattles,Couldn't get the baby interested in these wrist rattles as they are too quiet. They are cute and seem to be well made but the low sound renders them unusable. Great return policy at Amazon so was able to get my money back.
5,Great CD,A nice taste of traditional Gospel Music which we don't find a lot of anymore. Definitely a nice CD to have in your collection.
4,makes cleaning so easy!!,this product is great! it is bigger than i thought so we can fit so many toys in there. its full of color so my boy was excited when he saw it and it kinda motivated him to put his toys away in it. the only drawback is that the zipper doesnt open all the way around it only goes halfway through the circle but its not too much of a bother. i would really recommend this!
5,Great storage bin,"I bought this item a year ago and so far it is still in great shape. We use it to hold all my little girl's stuffed animals and she has alot of them! On occasions we do include her heavy toys -- no problem at all. We live in an apt and it helps having a storage bin that doesn't take up too much space, but big enough to store away toys."
3,Great Performances Hampered by Obsolete Technology,"I have an LP recording made sometime in the mid-70s which has much of the program material presented on this recording, so when I saw this one, I thought it would serve well as a replacement for my (shot down) record. Not quite.It is still Frederick Fennell, and he does superbly; and it is still the Eastman Wind Ensemble, and they are marvelous. From an artistic viewpopint, I regard this combination as artistically definitive. But they recorded this thing in the mid 1950s through a single (!) microphone. This means (obviously) a monaural recording, and no control over the equalization, leaving a dull sound lacking the excitement produced by the percussion in recordings of later time.Oh, well. The speakers on the average computer won't murder this music any worse than the ancient recording. And the performances are completely enthralling, as befits works of this magnitude."
1,Must be a REAL GOOD CD!,I am aware that the Eastman Wind Ensemble under the baton Of Mr. Fennell is quite a superb band but please tell me that the $999 price tag is a joke! That's better than the price of gold. I can't imagine what the price of an .mp3(if they would ever be offered)for each tune would be.Yoiks!
3,Eastman is Usually Better,"Strengths: The interpretation of the Chaconne in Holst's 1st Suite was fantastic. Too often, it is played like a funeral dirge, but I enjoyed the up-tempo style the Eastman Ensemble utilized. I thought the woodwinds were excellent in the second movement of Holst's 2nd Suite, the second movement of the Folk Song Suite, and especially the Psalm. The balance in the Psalm also struck me as exceptional. I also thought the trumpets sounded clear and crisp throughout the recording though they did drown out the countermelodies in the Toccata Marziale.Weaknesses: The bass trombone part was unclean in the Holst Suites and the Toccata Marziale. The inner woodwind voices in the Toccata Marziale and Conzona were at times hard to hear, and the flutes were too strong in Reed's Mexican Suite. The percussion was way too oppresive, especially in the Holst marches. Finally, I thought the entrances were weak in the Intermezzo of Holst's 1st Suite and throughout Reed's Suite."
3,Keystone Does Canzona and La Fiesta Better,The Songs of Abelard Disc has the definitive Canzona on it. The recently-released H. Owen Reed disc has a much better La Fiesta on it as well.
5,Flexing the muscles of the Matadora universe,"This book is great for any and all fans of the Matadora series.Taking place years before any of the existing books, this helps to flesh out the Confed and history that becomes important later on in the series.Fast paced as these books generally are, this is a good addition with some good surprises.I, for one, am hoping for more books to flesh out this universe even more or to link the story in this book to the rest of the books with more of Perry's creative storytelling."
5,Death came for him from behind a trade paperback...,"Question: What do thriller writers read when they want an adrenaline rush?Answer: Steve Perry.I've been hooked on the Matador books since I first stumbled across `The 97th Step' about fifteen years ago. I was disappointed when it seemed that the series had finally burned out. Then, along comes `The Musashi Flex,' and starts the fire all over again.If you've followed the saga of Pen, Dirisha, and the Man Who Never Missed, you're in for a treat. Steve Perry is back, with more intrigue, action, romance, and gadgetry than every before. If you're a newcomer to the battle against the Confed, step right through this door... Adventure lies this way...- Jeff Edwards, award-winning author ofTorpedo"
4,Easy to understand,This is a wonderful introductory biography for children. The text is big and easy to understand. The pictures and illustrations help children see who Levi Strauss was and what it was like during the time of the Levi's jeans invention.
1,Unwanted aren't always on welfare,"Unfortunately, this author fails to include unwanted children that even come from wealthy families. Unwanted children of wealthy families often end up in similar circumstances. Even though the focus of this book is primarily for families in poverty, the author fails to realize even further, that often times, children from wealthy families end up with NO HELP and NO RESOURCES for their plights, in contrast to programs specifically designed for those in poverty. He fails to recognize the value of programs as a universal ideal, as does the Federal Government.It is too bad that the author places the stigma of being an unwanted child based upon class. It is a sad enough dilemma in itself, especially when children are victimized and used as scapegoats, no matter what their class background may be."
4,Addictive Snack,"Sea's Gift Korean Seaweed Snack is pretty tasty. It's salty, crunchy, and can be added to almost any meal. Best of all, it's a healthy snack. Yup, I snacked through a bunch of packs feeling absolutely guilt-free.I bought this to replace the several stacks of Pringle chips I'd scarfed down on a weekly basis.Because I was expecting something heavier/fuller, I wasn't happy when I took my first bite of the seaweed. It felt similar to chewing on light salty, green paper. However, by the third pack the deliciousness kicked in and it tasted like crunchy,delicious chips. I couldn't put the stuff down! I loved how it added a little extra flavor to soup, pizza, and sandwiches.I love this snack and my family loves it as well! I will definitely buy it again. Just wish it were cheaper. >.<"
2,"Great product, way too much packaging","As much as I enjoyed this brand of seaweed snack, I was appalled at the layers of extra packaging it comes in. It's wasteful and not necessary, and I can't in good conscience keep buying a product that creates so much garbage."
1,Thin gross flakes of seawed,"I guess i should have looked more closly, i thought these were crunchy bites but they are not... they are just really thin sheets and disinagrate when you touch them."
1,I only gave them one star because I could not give them zero stars,"This product is made with canola oil. Something they failed to mention in the description. I stay away from canola oil every chance I get.It is not only one of the cheapest oils around, unless it has been genetically tested there is no way to tell if it is a GMO canola. I threwthe package away. Better in the trash than in me."
3,hmmmmmmm... not too tasty with a smoothie,"I bought these when they were featured at the bottom of my page. I like rice crackers that have that little piece of seedweed on them so I expected to like this product. I guess I was expecting more. The good news is my Manx cat, Jacob, did like them and will be more than happy to help eat Sea's Gift Seaweed Snack."
2,No This Is Not A Five star in product,Length:: 0:42 MinsThe mini packs of seaweed are as of season loosely compressed if its compressed as season shouldn't it be not commercialized of snack
4,it's seaweed,"If you're familiar with seaweed, this is a good brand for some plain'ol seaweed. It's not too salty and doesn't have any other seasoning. Just what I'm looking for.I would actually prefer the seaweed to be more salted, but I like my food salty to begin with, so I consider this to be a ""normal"" amount of salt that is added to the seaweed.My only complaint is the packaging which takes up a lot of place as trash."
2,Fishy,It tasted so fishy I had a hard time eating it. Didn't expect it to be that bad!!!!!!! If you like the taste of raw fish you will love it.
5,Excellent Service,"I purchased those because I had eaten them before and I liked the taste. I wanted to provide more iodine in my daily diet, so I was very satisfied with the product. Crispy, chewy, and salted, they were nice and delicious."
1,Disapointed,Bought these looking for a healthy snacks for the lunch box. Based on the reviews I was expecting them to be crunchy but they were not. The are sheet that stick to the roof of your mouth and then the taist hits you and you can't get it unstuck from the roof of your mouth. Too bad I have a whole case. I don't know anyone who will take these and now my children are afraid to try anything new. Can't blam them.
1,UGH! Not at ALL what descriptions says! and not returnable!,"Yuk! First of all, NOT crunchy, as someone mentioned. Little green slips of seaweed smashed into wafer think pieces of what looks like litmus paper. I suppose they could melt on your tongue if you could stand the taste. I did not expect seaweed to taste good but I did expect it to be crunchy, as described. There is literally nothing that can be done with these floppy pieces of yuk. Why put them in snack type bags if they are meant to be used in Miso Soup? Before you buy, I suggest trying a sample. I'm stuck with a case of 24. If anyone wants a free bag, email me your address. Maybe I'll try putting them in the oven. They couldn't be any worse"
5,great stuff,"My six year old loves these; slightly sweet, crunchy, salty. It's a reliable source of vegetable intake with lots of vits and mins."
5,Delicious!,"Healthy and delicious, easy to eat, perfect for cravings. Good source of natural iodine that can be absorbed by the body, unlike the iodine thats added to table salt."
5,The first bite is the hardest....and then addicted!,"At age 62 looking to increase my iodine intake to support thyroid health, I ordered these Nori snacks based on other reviews. Once delivered, the first bite was the hardest---I don't have a problem with fish oil or cod liver oil, but Nori is seaweed (yuck or so I thought). My surprise. I love these low carbohydrate salty-sesame-y little crips so much I now have them sent on the automatic shipment plan at quite a savings especially with Prime shipping.And this Sea's Gift brand with just the kim, sea salt, and sesame oil is the best tasting of all the brands I have subsequently bought and then did a side-by-side taste test. All of the other brands bought locally at the Korean grocery store had been processed with corn oil, a no-no for me. And I am now eating seaweed soup and seaweed salad (from the local Korean grocery) that are delicious--all because of the introduction to this product.That first bite, though, is the hardest. So glad I did it."
2,"Taste OK, But Poor Quality Control (If Any)","These seaweeds taste OK. Made in Korea, they taste comparable to the Japanese ones. But the quality control seems non-existent. We order a box, and have gone through half of it now. Just half of the box, one packet was already moist upon opening, meaning the seal had been compromised. Another packet was just empty. I mean EMPTY. No seaweed. Not even a grain of salt. Just a clear plastic holder was inside the wrapping. This is seriously screwed up.If you live in a large metropolitan area, you can easily find some seaweed snack with better quality control and better prices at any East Asian grocery."
2,Canola oil missing from ingredients,I ordered these based on the ingredient list as posted. Turns out they have canola oil which I try not to eat. The taste is fine but really disappointed this wasn't disclosed in the online ingredient listing. I would not have ordered them otherwise.
5,Delicious substitute for my Trader Joe's favorite,"I got completely addicted to the Trader Joe's seaweed snacks back when I was living in California. Now that I'm in DC, the Trader Joe's here doesn't carry the product consistently, and I prefer delivery groceries anyway. But I've been craving my favorite snack, and started searching around on Amazon for a substitute. This is more or less identical to the TJs seaweed snacks. Each package is slightly smaller than the TJs version, but the seaweed is the same taste and texture. I think it's actually cheaper too. Now if I can only find a substitute for their olive oil and sea salt popcorn, I'll be golden..."
1,foul tasting,"I ordered this based on the good reviews making it sound like it would be as addictive as potato chips. Now I KNOW it wasn't going to taste like potato chips, but I expected a product that would not be so foul smelling. Maybe I got a bad batch but I certainly can not recommend based on my own experience. Now I am stuck with these as I doubt they can be returned."
1,"Really, really ICKY!!","My daughter left some of these in my house, so I had a taste. Funny thing is, earlier in the day, I'd sampled some Milk Bone Dog Biscuits (at the behest of a very cute little grandson).The Milk Bone Dog Biscuits definitely needed some salt and a little more flavor, but compared to these Seaweed Snacks, the Dog Biscuits were ""de bon gout"" (that's French for delicious).As an experiment, I threw one of these snacks on the floor for my Sheltie, and she looked at me with sad eyes as if to say, ""Really? Why are we torturing the puppy?""In all seriousness, I like to try new things and organic food is good food, but this particular ""gift from the sea"" should be thrown overboard.Ick."
2,Not as fluffy-roasty as most roasted seaweed out there,"I was rather disappointed with this product. I love Korean roasted seaweed, but this particular brand seems to be rather tough and reminded me more of sushi seaweed texture."
5,Good Product from Amazon.com,Taste: 4/5Fresh: 5/5Quality: 5/5Overall: 4.7/5Good Product! Highly recommend! The best seaweed I have ever found in the U.S. so far.
4,Jayone has less salt...,The producer of Jayone Seaweed is the same as Sea's Gift Korean Seaweed which apparently is the biggest producer of Korean seaweed in the world. I was consuming Sea's Gift Seaweed but stopped and started consuming Jayone since it has less salt than Sea's Gift Seaweed. Superb exotic product. Bravo.
4,Perfect little snack for seaweed lovers,"I stumbled upon Sea's Gift (roasted/salted) seaweed at a Whole Foods and tried it. It was cheap and delicious. They're by no means filling but a great little treat for the price. I didn't find any of the cloying fishy taste that I'd expect from a seaborn snack. They are a lot like paper thin chips. Directions encourage using them as a topping. Have not tried that yet and probably won't. The flavor, I think, would get lost on other food. I eat them straight from the container."
3,"Great size, OK taste.","The size is great for a quick snack and it does hit the spot. However, I like the taste of the Trader Joe seaweed packs better."
2,"Didnt like the taste and yes, Canola oil is in these","I wouldnt call these a snack at all, its nori sheets with salt. Didn't like the taste it does contain canola."
2,Too Expensive,"OK, so they take a 'normal' sheet of seaweed paper, make it as empty as possible add a little salt and a glaze of canola oil then jack up the price.I used to eat seaweed paper sheets, but always felt they were missing something- canola oil and salt! You get a ginormously bigger bang for your buck eating sushi roll paper.This stuff is good, but not worth the price.(What's up with the bad reviews for taste. Yes it's fishy, it's seaweed paper!)"
3,"Awesome Product, Terrible Packaging.",I have eaten this seaweed for sometime and love it. What I don't love is the huge amount of packaging that goes into each shipment. I used to subscribe to get this once a month. It was shipped to me in a giant cardboard box which encased the much smaller seaweed box. Within that is 24 individually wrapped plastic containers. I love the product but can't look past the amount of plastics and waste that will come from it.
2,Not A Very Good Deal Afterall...,"Decent quality roasted seaweed snack compare to what you can get from Asian Markets and Trader Joe's. I didn't realize that they're 0.2oz size bags when I ordered. Even with the 15% subscription discount, which bring it down to $0.67 per bag, it's still cost 50%+ more then Trader Joe's (they sell a 0.4oz bag for $0.99). With that said, it actually cost $4.19 more to buy at quantity. My conclusion: if there's no outlet anywhere near you to get them, go ahead and give it a try. It's a healthier snack option. I will not order this again but rather buy a 2-3bags at a time from Trader Joe's in the area instead."
2,THIS IS PRETTY GROSS,"Not good at all. I am comparing these to the Trader Joes seaweed snacks. These are texturally similar, TJs are a bit crunchier. The flavor on these is pretty gross though. They do not taste fresh and crisp, they have this weird gross dirty seawater flavor. I would avoid these and try another brand. I wish amazon will allow a return, but it is food so highly unlikely."
5,Now Available for Subscribe and Save!!,"My whole family loves these snacks, especially our daughter. Her little cousin likes them too. They do not have a fishy taste and are lightly salted. They are a perfect size for a little snack. Just make sure to take out the little white packet inside before giving it to kids."
1,Nasty!,This tastes like gummy green fish. The wafers are paper thin. They melt on your tonge and turn into a chewy fishy nastiness that gets stuck in your teeth! I read all these great rewiews but I disagree. These things are really gross.
1,Not at all what I expected!,"To be fair I had never tried seaweed in this form before. I had a much different idea of what seaweed in this form would taste like... It was awful! And, what's worse I can't return it and am stuck with 23 unopened packages of the stuff. The taste wasn't so horrible, it was the texture. It kind of melted to my tongue, then as I went to swallow I would gag (it felt like I was swallowing a loogie(sp). Would not recommend unless you love seaweed in this form and know what you are getting!"
1,Worst thing I have ever put in my mouth!!!!,I chose this because it was a recommended item based on other healthy snacks I have liked. But this was DISGUSTING!!! It was like putting a piece of paper that smelled and tasted like old fish in my mouth! GROSS GROSS GROSS!
2,Not thrilled with this - no substitute for chips,"I read all the reviews before I ordered. I don't know what kind of ""chips"" these people used to eat, but this seaweed is no substitute for chips of any kind. I bought into the idea that eating seaweed is healthy so I decided to order. It's not bad to put in stews or sprinkle over salads, but I cannot just eat them like they are chips. That's just a crazy concept. You get several packets of seaweed crisps-but it's more like thin crinkly paper that falls apart when you touch it. It tastes like you would imagine seaweed would taste like. Am I any healthier for eating this? I am not sure. Would I buy this product again- probably not. But I can't fault the product for my purchase of it. I got plenty of it and it will last me for months. But if you buy this because you read other reviews that it's a replacement for potato chips or salsa chips or chips of any kind -- that's just crazy."
5,Scent of Shadows,"We met Vicki Pettersson at her book signing at the book store in McCarron airport in Las Vegas in July, 2007. She is so charming and beautiful - especially in her photograph with me - that we had to buy the first book. I was mesmerized by the thoughts which she put on paper. I really didn't expect such a clever tome. As soon as I finished the first book, I ordered the second one, which I just finished. I think this is a terrific series, and wouldn't be suprised to see it on The big screen. I'm an M.D., and usually read medical works, which are just slightly less intense than these books! Put me on the list for the future ones..."
2,Terrible writing...,"The premise of this book is interesting, but the vehicle just doesn't work. COME ON...Ms. Pettersson writes like a 5th grader. I mean...blind date?!?! Disinherited ?!?! GIVE ME A BREAK.... I mean, if the heroine is so bad-as* why hasn't she ever told her jerk of a ""father"" to go jump in a lake?! So she can keep living on his dime and not get a job? That way she can continue wandering the streets of Las Vegas every night. Whatever."
4,Good story line,"Pretty engaging book, I enjoyed the story line and build up of characters. I am looking forward to the second book"
2,"I wanted to like it , I really did","Honestly, I enjoyed the first hundred pages or so and thought it had great promise. The the major plot flaws started popping up. Top secret information available in the form of a comic book? Hiding the main character's identity through major (whole body) plastic surgery? And why couldn't the bad guys figure out her identity? Seemed like it could have been figured out with some basic logic. The Zodiac? A bunch of fools. I'm rooting for the bad guys this time - or I would be if I planned to keep reading.By the way, this has the distinction of being the only book that I've ever given up on with only 30 pages to go. I just couldn't make myself care enough to finish."
2,Not Thrilled,"I'm sorry I know this book has gotten good reviews and I honestly think the author is a good writer, I just couldn't get into the story line."
3,"Made the Grade: Sign of the Zodiac Series, Book 1","3 out of 5 stars. Okay this book I almost gave up on. I got through the first 5-6 chapters and I was bored. But thankfully I skimmed to the good parts and kept reading since I did finally get hooked. However, you have to admit that the beginning is kinda unreal ... it's like she gets everything and nothing at all, which completely ruined it for me. But anyway ... if your like me then I recommend to keep reading it once you start since it does get better!Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"
4,Creative plot & good writing,I really enjoyed this series. The plot is creative and one I have not seen before. Her main character is easy to sympathize with and each book has a twist. It's unexpected. I would recommend to anyone who likes a good fantasy series.
4,Good but really frustrating as well...,"I thought this book was fun and interesting but I had one MAJOR problem. ***SPOILER ALERT*** After joining the forces of the light and getting knocked out and plastic surgery while unconscious and against her will...she wakes up mildly miffed but no where NEAR as angry and violated as I felt her character (or anyone for that matter) would be. I got so upset by her lack of animation after wards that it kind of ruined the rest of the book for me, which was over all pretty good except for that. I don't even know if I want to try and read the second one because of it..."
2,Cliche,"Pettersson is a new writer and it shows. While she has moments of seamless and clever narrative, these moments are sparing. The heroine has all the earmarks of science fiction, from a practically divine birth, to extra special super powers, to model-esq beauty, to rugged toughness. She is just a terrible genre cliché, who struggles to be, but ultimately fails to overcome her meager 2 dimensions.Instead of showing the reader Jo's attributes, she tells us. Over and over again. If a character has protective or philanthropic characteristics, there are better ways of letting us know then having yet other characters just blurt these titles out.I think that Pettersson shows serious promise, but she needs more time to develop her craft."
2,Disappointed,"I so wanted to like this series! I love this genre and the cover looked amazing! I started reading and could not get through the whole thing. It seemed to have every ingredient in the books I devour but this one unfortunately did not stand up to some of the other greats. The characters seemed a bit flat and the writing on the mediocre side. If you are looking for a great read I would stick to Kim Harrison, Kelley Armstrong, Kelly Gay, Stacia Kane, Kalayna Price and Diana Rowland to name a few."
3,OK read!,"this is a good read, but slow in some parts and the story doesn't seem to move fast enough for me. it has been a bit of a struggle to finish it. interesting topic, people of the zodiac signs have special powers and need to fix something so this world won't get destroyed."
3,A good start for a new writer,"Positives - engaging storyline, interesting settingNegatives - plot holes, bad characterization, uneven writingThere are a number of things good about this work, but ultimately it falls down with plot and characterization flaws. It sits with other books of this genre with some original elements (zodiac signs, light and dark warriors). I was disappointed in this book; possibly because the heroine becomes super powered rather quickly, gaining the best of all worlds (looks, power, etc). If the genre (romantic paranormal fantasy, with very strong wish fulfillment) is a reader favorite, this is a good choice. However, if you aren't able to continue past flaws of writing and plot this book is not for you.Its a good first novel, but ultimately not a keeper. Here is hoping the author continues in her work and the second installment is a stronger effort."
2,Just couldn't get into this book,"I picked up this book because the plot looked so interesting. But as soon as it got to the part where she woke up as her sister...I just couldn't see this happening and the main character not going completely berserk. Yes, she agreed to help them, but this went a little too far. And she seemed o.k. with it, after about a paragraph worth of fussing. I can handle 'out there' plot lines, but please, no one who is sane would be fine waking up as their dead sister. No matter what the cause. I wasn't that into this book anyway, but when I got to this part I just gave up. I haven't done that with a book in...I actually don't think I ever have. I usually make myself finish them. But I just couldn't with this one."
2,Disappointing,"This book started out with some interesting ideas and character development but fizzled quickly. In the first few chapters we are introduced to Joanna who is coming of age in a supernatural way. Then, she hides out in a sanctuary for nearly the entire remainder of the book! Basically talking incomprehensible mytho-babble and contemplating her navel. I couldn't even finish the book - I was so bored by the time she finally planned to face the bad guys that I didn't even care how `the big battle' turned out and I just closed the book without reading it."
2,"Good Writing, Awful Story","If you include the truly awful title, The Scent of Shadows, is a pretty lame story about a girl with mysterious powers who comes into her own, after nearly being killed by the bad guys who can smell her psychically or some such hogwash. This was excessively violent and I completely lost interest when the heroine stops by a comic shop to do 'research'. I've done tons of research in my life, and none of it was gleaned from comic books. My recommendation is, don't bother with this. There are plenty of good books, or even just better books out there and you don't need to use of precious seconds of your life with this drek. I only give it two stars because the writing was good. Plot and storyline were ludicrous, even for fantasy--or whatever you call this stuff."
2,Awful story telling,"The first part of the book was exciting and had me thinking that this could be an interesting superhuman book.Then the clumsy writing, a bit of deus ex machina, and a deplorable hero got in the way.After the first 20% I just wanted it to end, which it did, but unfortunately left the story open to sequels."
3,A different twist,"This is a new and different story. There are a few aspects of the story that could be developed better, but all in all it is enjoyable. It is so hard to find new stories. I hope the next few in this series have clearer story lines."
2,I thought I would enjoy this book,"I had really high hopes for this kindle freebie, especially since it was rare non CF find. The book started out great, its a good concept that just wasn't fleshed out. Its a rare occasion when I don't finish a book but I'm about 50% through and highly doubt I will pick it back up again."
4,"Hmmmm, free and better than anticipated","If you have a Kindle, this book is free right now. I scan through the best seller Kindle list about once a month and grab a few books to try.....well, not a few, a LOT of books really. This book I did like very much, and am right now pulling up the rest of the series to give it a look-see.....might try #2 today.The writing style was a tad jumpy which is fine with me.....being bored by mundane details is a nightmare. Overall....Amusing, with likable characters, and at times a bit touching, believe it or not. Good read."
3,Book One of the Sign of the Zodiac Series,"Coming home after a night with her boyfriend, sixteen-year-old Joanna Archer was raped and viciously beaten. She should have died that night, but by some miracle, she survived. Now she's no longer a victim. Trained in Krav Maga, she roams the streets in the most dangerous parts of town, hoping to find the man who took away her innocence--her life. What she's about to discover is a hidden world of superheroes, of good versus evil, and who she really is.With Las Vegas as the backdrop, this exciting premises starts out with clever dialogue and energetic characters, but soon turns bizarre when a homeless man enters the picture. His role is to guide her into the next transition of her life, where she has the ability to tap into special powers.The story then hits a lull until three-quarters of the way through. If the middle part had been nearly as engaging as the first and last quarter, the book would have been a top-notch read."
2,Why is this different from the other same season item?,I'm seeing that this is 255 minutes at $23 and the other is 275 minutes at $28. What's the deal? what's the difference here? Is there reall a missing 20 minutes on the $23 version? Why?
3,Just okay,"The cast was great (Christina Applegate especially) and the storyline is believable. The humor is sometimes a bit forced and unnatural. Drew Barrymore looks awful in almost every shot, whomever did makeup needed fired. I would say this is good for a rental, but don't buy it because you wouldn't want to watch it more than a couple times, if that."
1,not sure i was going to finish the movie...,The acting was quite bad and the script unimaginative. I was looking forward to watching this movie because it had some good actors. Unfortunately it sucked. The concept was a good idea but the execution was awful. :(
1,Just not funny.,"Just another lame, predictable, cliche romantic comedy, and it's not even that funny. Actually, not funny at all.Just very boring, so boring due to the writing and actors."
1,1-Star Reviews are 100% on. I lost brain cells watching this film!,"Acting is pretty bad. Plot is pretty poor and so, so overdone it's like watching a re-run of countless other 1990-2010 romance movies. Language between main characters is dreadfully lousy. Cliches are so, so over-used, I was annoyed every time one was used. 110% predictable storyline which left nothing for the brain to do over almost 2 hours... hence the lost brain cells. Sorry, this movie was a waste of time after the first 10 minutes. Drew Barrymore didn't look so good, wasn't funny, and is clearly in the wrong film genre now. Sorry to say... she lost her cutesy charm and spunk. The drug usage was just plain dumb and the characters looked absolutely stupid smoking the bong. Not romantic at all. Besides a few minutes of scenes, barely funny at all. Save your time and money and rent something a little better with Drew Barrymore like ""The Wedding Singer."" Okay, out for now."
4,Good movie but has more swearing than needed,"I really liked this movie--I thought it was entertaining and cute and a fun story. However, the swearing in it seemed forced--like there was just more crammed in than what would normally take place. I wasn't offended by it, but rather just thought it was distracting and made me wonder what if the writers actually swear this much or what was up with that?"
1,What a Waste!!!!!!!!!,Quite simply this was a piece of trash. I had no idea Drew would be a part of something so degrading to the human race. I did not finish watching this. There was no message just the vile dumbing down and disrespect for anything significant in life.
1,worst movie,Don't waste your time or money on this movie.Has to be the WORST movie EVER. No plot bad acting. Expected better from Drew.May have to rethink seeing her next movie.Would have given it a -10 but there isn't one.
1,get a clue film makers. the f word is not funny or romantic,"boo!! super disappointed in drew. i wish hollywood would grow up and turn down crap scripts full of filth. i don't mind a well placed curse word, but good grief! my hubby and i did the right and smart thing and turned this movie off within the first 15 minutes, for that we give ourselves 5 stars ;o)"
1,One of the worst movies of the year.,"Sorry, but this is one of the worst movies of the year. Bad script. Mediocre story. Bad acting. Mediocre camera work. Cruddy as a chick flick, too (via wife). Don't say I didn't warn you."
3,Cute movie.,"This movie has a lovely, well-casted group of actors and a really cute story line. The rough language really gets in the way and becomes truly tiresome. Enjoyable despite overuse of the f word."
2,"Cliche, but has it's moments","There didn't appear to be a lot of chemistry between Justin & Drew, but the story has a couple of really funny parts. It won't go down in celluloid history as one of the great love stories, but if you can live with a handful of laughs, you should get this dvd. The dining room scene alone is worth purchasing the movie."
4,Hillarious!,My husband & I both loved this movie. We found ourselves laughing hysterically periodically throughout. If you need a good laugh watch it!
2,Nope. Sorry.,"Going the Distance was a huge disappointment. I usually love anything with Drew Barrymore in it, and I adore romantic comedies. It just didn't do it for me. It seemed slow moving and the dialogue was lame or just awful. Some scenes were so off-putting I just couldn't stand it.I watched it all the way through with other people, only to discover at the end that we were all just being polite, thinking that others were enjoying it. It's unaminous: this is not the finest hour for ordinarily fine actors.Not worth a second watch."
1,"Awful, awful movie","I ordered this on VOD and stopped it once and then tried to give it a second try the next day. No go. What an awful, awful movie. No redeeming qualities. Just full of vulgar and sophomoric dialog/situations; nothing short of soft-core pornography in some instances. What really makes me angry? That the producers didn't even have the guts to ""own"" this film. Instead, it was marketed as a Drew Barrymore ""romcom"" and not the crass movie that it is. Ms. Barrymore seems to be entering that stage of her career where she feels the need to break out of a mold and be ""edgy"". Usually that leads to disaster for good comedic actresses (see Meg Ryan and Jennifer Aniston) and ""Going the Distance"" is no exception. And, sorry, no matter how hard Justin Long tries to reinvent himself as some sort of player, it just doesn't work to play that far against type. Silver lining, I paid $1.99 on VOD, rather than $12 at the theater."
2,it had some funny scenes but was too dirty and predictable!,The movie was too dirty it had way to many jokes and scenes that were not necessary their is no problem with mentioning sex and being funny but when you take it too far their is a problem. This movie went too far their were jokes about sexual things and even a scene with the justin long naked which was also disgusting and unnecessary. I understand in hollywood their is no morals and no christian values but at-least make the movie better. The best thing about the movie was Charlie Day he was funny but everyone else was not that great especially jason sudeikis who is just not funny! the casting was an overall B- but the dialogue and story was an D-!
4,A solid romantic comedy,"A young couple hooks up, and then they begin a relationship that lasts the summer. The woman has to return to California for school, thus they commence a long distance affair. The usual problems arise, forcing them to determine where they are going and if the relationship will endure. This is a well-cast romantic comedy, with excellent chemistry between the leads. At times, the viewer feels as if they are sitting in on real conversations between a burgeoning couple, rather than a scripted film, as if the scenes were developed by the actors. Going the Distance is funny, moving, and feels genuine."
2,WHAT A TRAGEDY,"A brilliantly written, well acted film that was ruined by immaturity....What could have been another 'When Harry Met Sally' was ruined by the adolestent over use of the 'F' word...Over 40 times, this trash was added to what was otherwise a great script...I wasn't 'shocked' I was BORED....It reminds of the the little boy who discovers the word 'Poo Poo' and says it over and over again....We've had the X Generation, the Y Generation, now we have the 'F' Generation...this word adds nothing to any script yet these 'professional children' feel a need to use it needlessly..Hugh Prather said,"" When you use an obscenity, you stop 'saying' something and you 'become' something...You take attention off your 'thoughts' and put it on your 'words'..what a great missed opportunity"
5,5+ stars!!,I said u hoes cant fade street military!!...man hold up....jammin! Full blooded ni@@as from Houstone Texas.. Just get and bring it back .
1,Chicken from China may contain excess lead,"I asked my vet about the dried chicken products for pets that come from China. Specifically, I asked if these products could be from the millions of chickens they have had to kill due to avian flu. He said that not only could they very well be from those chickens, but that chickens from China used in pet foods contain an excess of lead. There are no regulations screening imports of chicken for pet food. I have yet to find a dried chicken strip for dogs that wasn't from China."
5,My dogs love it,My dogs love this product. Since I buy the chicken strips on a regular basis I had my vet check for lead in their system. I would want more info before I stop buying this chicken because my dogs love it. I am going to have my dogs check in 6 months if no lead no worries.
2,nto worth the money,"This book only has 100 puzzles, and for the $8.95 price, it's just not worth it. The puzzles are all levels, not just the more difficult as the title implies. You can get twice the number of puzzles (100 difficult and 100 very challenging)for $6.95 from ""Let's Play Sudoku - Over the Edge"" by Will Shortz. If you want simpler puzzles, there are 2 easier books of 200 puzzles each in the Will Shortz series, both for $6.95 each as well. I've learned that when a book item description like Grand Master Su Doku doesn't list the number of pages or puzzles, that's a red flag that it's not a good value. If it was a good value, they would list it as a selling point!"
5,Excellent!,Excellent overview of the new field of psychoacoustics. Well written and absorbing. Lots of resources included for further study/information/application.
4,Nice,"I keep buying more versions of the fifth, which is my favorite. I'm never really happy with them though. If you own Mravinsky's set, you've got it all! The only ones that have come close with me are the Jansson's. It's a powerful ride, but the master is still the master."
3,Background Christmas music,"OK, I am old enough to remember Jackie Gleason as a child/teenager, so I bought this Christmas CD and I don't regret it. After listening to it several times, I must say that it is good for background Christmas music, as it is entirely instrumental and orchestral in feel. Which is not a bad thing , as I have over 100 Christmas CD's that I have playing in a shuffle mode.I don't feel the Jackie Gleason connection here, I was hoping for a more distinct personality, that's all.I apologize in advance if I offended any Jackie Gleason fanatics out there ."
2,Proceed with caution.,"Slow, laid-back orchestra interpretations of holiday tunes. Really slow. The well-known traditional pieces are fun, but it seems like half the album is obscure (to me, anyway) stuff included because it has either Chirstmas or holiday in the title. The liner notes paint a picture of relaxing in front of the fire after hosting a christmas party while enjoying the album. The music does live up to that, but the style begins to wear thin all too soon - I couldn't even finish listening to the album. In addition, the ""remaster"" either was too faithful to the original or maybe the original wasn't all that good to begin with, but the listening sounds pretty low-fi. I'd say the album is worth having for four or five of the pieces, but not at full price. My guess is that you'll see this for a dollar or two next year."
2,Not a good Fit,Purchased a set of these for my 95 accord V6. Will not fit around the bearing without grinding the rotor.
4,good purchase,I purchased this to use as a hamper in our baby girls room. The bright colors and flower work great in her nursery. As a hamper it is okay. The top only unzips about halfway and so you need to use two hands to drop in the laundry. Also have to remember that it is collapsable and will fall over if anything is dropped on top of it.
1,Nonsense!,"I received this book as a gift after the birth of my first child. I now have five biological children (plus two adopted step-children), and I have yet to experience the absolute hell Ms. Einhorn seems to think new motherhood is. The entire premise of her book is ""Having a brand new baby sucks. Your husband can't possibly understand, and your mother / mother-in-law / anyone who tries to offer advice will be horribly overbearing and question your every decision. Therefore you should not feel guilty about dumping the baby off on anyone you can find and running out to go drinking with your friends whenever possible."" How any new mom can find this supportive or uplifting is beyond me."
4,Loving Family,The Large Loving Family was larger than I expected so I exchanged it for the smaller one. Returning it was an extremely easy process and the replacement was shipped right away. I absolutely love my new charm. The only thing I didn't like about it was the chain. I used one of my old ones.
2,Apparently Keb Mo' is not a perpetual blues machine.....,"I would have to say that I have listened to Keb Mo's first two albums more than I have done anything else over the last year. That's why I was so fired up about the release of ""Slow Down."" Unfortunately, this album did nothing for me. If you're like me, and you love the soft roll of Keb's guitar, and the scratchy wail of his voice then this isn't the album for you. It's too upbeat, peppy, not bluesy at all."
4,This CD is a can't miss for any music fan.,"This is my first real taste of Keb Mo.If this is the main course, give me more. Mr. Moore has something for everyone on this release. I first heard some of the tracks from Slow Down on a live broadcast on KFOG Radio. The broadcast was so good, and I had heard that there was an import recording of the show, that I was actually looking for that CD. Since I couldn't find it, I had to ""settle"" for Slow Down. Now I wish I hadn't waited. Keb Mo takes you form the Delta to Jump Blues and everywhere in between. This is not a purists blues CD, but rather one that will appeal to the masses. I look for a certain quality in music, particulary in the lyrics and Slow Down fits the bill. If you buy this CD, you'll keep it and want to share it."
4,The best way to bring the folk-blues to the next century,"It's just the way it should be. Allright, I did not gave the 5 stars, because ""I Just Can't Be Satisfied"" and I sincerely hope to hear a better album, a better song and a better Mo', but ""Slow Down"" continue to puzzle me! I can't see how something like play acoustic blues to a new generation could be better than this."
5,Gritty blues with funk thrown in for good measure,"There is absolutely not one song on this CD that I didn't enjoy. But, I think Rainmaker is my favorite. His smooth, gravelly voice soothes my soul and makes me want to hold my baby close. This is my first Keb' Mo' experience, but it won't be my last, I've already ordered his first, titled Keb' Mo', I'm told that one is even better. But, how can that be? Slow Down is perfect! I'm thrilled to have discovered this amazing talent! Can't you tell?"
5,Is there any style of Blues Keb Mo' CAN'T play?!?,"WOW! This CD totally blew me away; I've loved the blues since I was twelve, listening to nighttime DJ Jimmy Rabbit on KLIF in Dallas playin' Jimmy Reed's ""Bright Lights, Big City"" more than 40 yrs ago, but when I heard this, it was like I was hearing the blues for the first time. Motown, Memphis, Mississippi delta, it's all here, and it's all GOOD. This is the kind of CD you can put on repeat and never get tired of it!"
3,Good but not as good,"Slow Down is exactly what I think that Keb needs to do, I think that he was getting pressured by the Record Co. to get another CD out because the first 2 were so good and selling very well. There are some good tracks on Slow Down and it still shows Keb's icredible talents but, it doesn't have the feeling and emotion that his first 2 did."
2,Too Smooth for Blues,"Keb' Mo' came on the scene as a breath of fresh air for the blues. But, as his albums and output progress, it appears that he has elected to adopt a smooth, polished style that will turn-off many blues purists, who prefer the grit and pain of traditional blues. So, if you and yours are fans of Kenny G, Grover Washington Junior, Boney James, etc., then this stuff is for you. Oversimplified, safe, and at times quite boring. There are a handful of semi-precious gems on this album, including ""I Was Wrong,"" ""Henry,"" and ""Rainmaker;"" and the HDCD encoding allows for exception sound quality. Overall this is a nice, safe, happy, blues disc that lacks a certain something. But, if you need a present for Xmas, your mother would love to put this in rotation for her next Bookclub meeting."
4,Keb' Mo' slow down,"Keb Mo has quite a few different artists sounds in him. They mix excellent, to make a unique sound which IS Keb' Mo'."
2,"It's Ok, but it ain't the BLUES.","I just bought Kevin Moore's first CD and, while it is pretty good, I certainly would not call it Blues. What are people talking about when they call this a great Blues album, or that Keb Mo is the ""Greatest singer since Muddy Waters"" (Indeed!)?? People like Keb Mo and Eric Clapton and Bonnie Rait provide watered down Blues to people who are afraid to listen to the REAL STUFF or can't be bothered seeking it out on their own. You want Blues? Listen to Charley Patton or Robert Johnson or Skip James or Bukka White -- but PLEASE don't compare them to Keb Mo, Clapton or any of the other corporate ""blues"" musicians producing product for mass consumption!"
2,Keb Mo is overrated,"Keb Mo's music is pleasant, a sort of folk-pop with some blues influences, aimed squarely at the baby boomer market. For deep blues, look elsewhere."
2,Too Modern For Me,"Keb Mo is a wonderfull talent. But this album is not his best works. Unfortunately it is a very modern sounding CD. Seems like Keb lost his traditonal roots on this CD. Slowly doing away with the Delta slide, and importing more of he ""electrified"" side of the blues.It would be nice if these talented artits wouldn't let money get in the way of their true talent. I know there are alot of fans out there who love the traditonal Delta sound."
2,you get less than what you pay,The only tool in this kit that works well is the crinkle cutter.The spiral cutter has a fat nylon screw to drive it. It is so thick that it splits carrots. The ring to put your finger in is half as thick as my wedding band so you predrill a carrot with a skewer and then you do two carrots for a sore finger.The double spiral cutter has but a twist of flat metal before the 8. It won't go anywherre with out lots of hand pressure. The little removable handle that is put on the end isn't shown.The V saw/knife is light weight steel that one can flex in your hands. If you are patient it will eventually penetrate a pumpkin wall. A good paring knife is far faster.The knife is tiny with a fraile handle. I threw it out.
2,Cheap stuff,"The tools either don't work very well, fall apart or cut the user do to cheap manufacturing!"
5,easy to make veggies look good,"Even a stumble thumbs like me can make vegetables look good, and professional, with these tools. I highly recommend these for amyone that loves to cook."
5,good set,"this is not high quality set, but what u want with so cheaper price!? this is good set, better has a better/bigger price. U can buy this set and use it, but careful for your finger. his work!"
2,Cheap and not worth it!,"I bought these tools for my catering buinsess, when I first got them I was disapointed. some of them are flimsy and break as soon as you use them, but others are okay, and work well. over all im disapointed, I would recommend searching for another set before you buy these!"
1,Hey Amazon!! Wrong Album / Wrong Group!!,Sculptured is a Death Metal band and you have some rap artist in their place!! Please correct this!
2,"Sturdy, but missing one very important thing...","This is a well built deck that has held up just fine with heavy use. However, I would not buy another one because IT DOES NOT HAVE A REAL TIME COUNTER FOR THE CASSETTE DECK. For a $375 industrial deck, to omit a real time counter is ridiculous."
1,Didn't work with my Samsung phone,Generates terrible static or hangs up my phone every time I try to use it with my Samsung cell phone. Wish I could have tried it before buying.
2,drawn out but not boring,"Maybe Dominion deservers 2.5 stars, I don't know. Anyway, if you have already seen Exorcist Beginning than you may find this a bit lengthy. Regardless, this version came out before the other prequel and did okay in terms of a story though the scare factor is almost non-existent. Dominion is mainly about the earlier years of Father Merrin from the original exorcist movie. Things don't get intense until the very end and I honestly prefer Exorcist Beginning over this. The stories between the two are almost exactly the same. Plus, the dvd features are lacking and the deleted outtakes aren't that good. It is interesting that the same actor who played Merrin in Dominion went on to play Merrin in the other prequel as well."
2,BETTER LEFT ALONE,"While Paul Shrader's typically lush, original version of the Exorcist prequel is infinitely better than Harlin's incoherent mess, it is still an exercise in futility. The original Exorcist has spawned nothing but srangely dense, difficult to swallow meanderings that have nothing to do with the heart, soul and terror of the original. It's as if the screenwriters and directors of all of these sequels and prequels and offshoots missed the commercial appeal of the first and only decent Exorcist movie: it was a basic, well-told story of good versus evil. It made the devil real. It was scary. Though there are moments in Dominion that have a strange, poetic beauty to them, the movie starts out in debt - it has no compelling story to tell."
2,Honest Review :),"During early on in the movie, I thought this could be pretty good. I tried to ignore the horrible CGI FX used. I mean, for God's sake why would you CGI a snake?!? They have camels in this movie, could they not get a snake from somewhere?? The CGI hyenas, snake, and other special FX are pretty horrible. It does have a couple of interesting ideas that are kinda shocking (e.g. the cripple boy's appearance, that little baby skeleton, and the maggot baby). I started feeling this movie was taking too long to get to the point around 40 minutes before the movie was over. The storyline was good, but it could have been explained in a shorter time. The acting seemed to get worse as the movie progressed. I am going to check out the other Prequel to the Exorcist. I heard that Dominion was the better of the two Exorcist prequels, but I am scared to think the other is worse than this."
1,Two Word Description: Stink Bomb.,"This movie stinks on so many levels I don't know where to begin. The biggest offense of this film is that it is just not scary - tedious, stupid and predictable would be a better description, but certainly not scary. The acting is wooden, dialog stilted and the special effects laughable. I've seen community theater productions with better set designs than this turd of a movie. My brother recommended this film and I'm still not speaking to him. If this is supposed to be the better of the two prequels to the original Exorcist I can't even begin to imagine how awful Renny Harlin's other prequel (Exorcist: The Beginning) must be. I now understand why the studio executives at Morgan Creek pitched this stinker overboard before it was even finished! Hell, it took two whole days just to get the smell out of my house that this movie made. Director Paul Schrader has proven the only thing worse than demonic possession is boredom."
1,Casper is scarier.,"Casper is scarier than this junk.As you may know, there was some problem during the shooting and the director was replaced, so I heard, and they wound up making two movies. Well I saw the first one last year and it was decent. Not scary, just decent. Well today I saw this Dominion movie, and I can see why they fired the director. I can only picture the director showing this dud to the studio executives, and after the movie ended and the lights went off, one of the execs turned to the director and said ""Didn't anyone tell you this was supposed to be a scary movie?""I saw it on DVD and still walked out a few times to go to the bathroom and check my email. Without a doubt, not only was this one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but should get an award for making a jackass out of me for renting the almost-same movie twice.An Oscar should definitely go to the marketing geniuses behind releasing a movie made from the scraps of another movie."
1,It needs less then one star,"I believe after The Exorcist 2, The Exorcist series just stedily went down hill. Pt 3 lost its fear factor; The Beginning lost its fear factor and lacked good effects; Dominion had no fear factor at all, the effects sucked, the plotline was not original and it was boaring, the acting was poor, and the movie was about an hour too long. If you want to see movies with great possession scenes check out The first two Exorcist movies, Stigmata, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, or American Haunting. Don't watch this even if it comes on the tv, you'll be waisting your time."
2,"Dominion, to be watched for comparison only","If you are a true fan of the Exorcist, watch this strictly for comparison vs. what was released in it's place, and how it ties in with the original. I was extremely disappointed with this movie and even though Exorcist: The Beginning has it's flaws, it's far better. This movie fails miserably in plot/content, acting, and effects to name a few. It will easily be forgotten with Exorcist 2&3. It should have been released as a bonus disk with The Beginning as originally planned, but was shelved for good reason. Rent, don't buy, and try not to fall asleep as I did twice."
1,THIS FILM SUCKS.,"Nevermind all of these reviews that attempt to dissect the film or compare and contrast it to ""Exorcist: The Beginning"". The truth is simple: Morgan Creek knew it had an absolute turkey on it's hands and thankfully they brought in Renny Harlin to re-envision the entire project. ""Dominion"" is utterly boring; the performances are unengaging, and the effects are a complete joke. Even worse are the scenes in which the priests encounter the character who is possessed... it was more reminiscent of ""Repossessed"" starring Leslie Nielsen. Watch ""Exorcist: the Beginning"" for a far superior supernatural film experience that's worthy of this franchise. In short, Dominion sucks!"
3,It's a lot better then Harlin's version ...,"Let's put it this way, this is a film that's always probably going to better known for it's production mythology then for it's story. I'd love it if the DVD version was released with a comentary by Schrader. I'd be REALLY intrigued by how he looks back on this piece.As far as the film itself goes, it's more of a thriller then it is a horror movie. That should be a suprise to no one though. The whole reason it was scraped in the first place is that the studio wanted something with a little more ""blood-and-guts"" so to speak.On the whole, it's a ""must see"" simply because it's light-years better then that piece of garbage that hack Renny ""Cut Throat Island"" Harlin threw together. However, as part of the Exorcist mythos, it loses a few points for still not really working all that well."
1,A waste of time,"The most horrifying thing about this movie is that I spent money to watch it. This movie is not scary at all. It's tedious and predictable. The writing is sub par and now I understand why the studio rejected this version to remake a second version. I've seen the 'qualified' theatrical release (Excorcist: The Beginning) and that one is better than this waste of celluloid. Both of them are nowhere as good as the first two Excorcist movies of course. Anticipating that I would be scared sooner or later, I kept watching, but boy was I wrong! This movie is just plain lame. If you want to watch, just don't expect much from it."
3,Better then Exorcist The Beginning,Thats all I can really say. Nothing more nothing less. Exorcist the beginning was so abysmal that i walked out of the theatre its the only movie that compelled me to do so.
3,Not much better than Exorcist: The Beginning,"In my opinion, Dominion- Prequel To The Exorcist is not much better than Exorcist: The Beginning. They're both pretty crummy films but in different ways. Simply put, ""Beginning"" was basically your typical, modern day, lousy horror film. I mean, look who directed it! Renny Harlen?? Please. ""Dominion"" isn't the run of the mill bad movie, i.e. lousy acting, dialogue, no plot.... it was just dull. Perhaps in the hands of another writer this film would be a worthwhile viewing. I just found myself glancing over at the clock every 15 minutes or so to see how far along the movie was. And yes, as stated in the other reviews, the CGI effects(the hyena's) are appalling. I don't know how the director or studio saw the CGI and OK'ed it. I mean how hard is it to use trained animals to do what was required for those scenes?! Overall, if I had to recommend one over the other, I would probably go with ""Dominion"". Like I said, not painful to watch, but dull."
4,Brings back credibility to the franchise,"This film is way better than the Harlin version. Actually requires thinking which I know is a daunting task for some. Better character development as well. Although it wasn't everything it could have been, it brings back some respectability to a franchise thathas sucked. The Exorcist and Dominion are the only two films in the series worth owning."
1,Starts promising but falls flat quickly.,"I loved the start of the movie. Right where they get to uncovering the buried church.From there the movie takes a nose dive so fast I really don't know where to begin.The acting, the FX (lol, I can't even type FX without laughing.) Horrible.A local ""cursed"" village boy is possessed by some demon with glowing eyes.To the non scary demon voice. Any death metal singer sounds scarier than this.The film got so unrealistic, so silly and just so plain stupid I had to forward through the last half hour.I can see why the Hollywoood big wigs shelved this turd.It's an embarrassment to the original Exorcist.I mean really?Was it really that hard to come up with a suspenseful, original back story to Merrin?I doubt it.Not even straight to dvd quality.Horrible story.Acting that is far from convincing.A cool location but that was about it.Not recommended unless train wreck movies are your thing."
2,quite a boring and dull movie,"I bought this thinking it might be better than The Exorcist-The beginning but oh boy it wasnt, it was plain dull. ugh i think 'The Beginning' was quite tepid and flashy and modern but this was plain boring.i don't recommend it or really recommend the other one either.i don't think the exorcist need a prequel. prequels generally suck.the exorcist doesn't need a prequel .forget both movie and just watch Freidkin's movie. from 73.better than what they can come up with now with flashy editing and camera work and jump scare nonsense. neither of these prequels has the atmosphere of freidkin's exorcist movie.ignore this mediocre crap."
5,Great Cocktail Book!,"This is a great book! I purchased the book about a year ago and was happy to find a large number of drinks listd! I plan on making the Mock Kahlua and Mock Grand Marnier as holiday gifts and the eggnog for Christmas. The book is on the smaller size, around the size of a checkbook, but I think its cute! I enjoy cocktail books and it was such a relief to find a cocktail book with a huge variety of drinks that fits into my low carb life style. I highly recommend it!!P.S. I have given this book as gifts!"
1,small little booklet-,"I was disappointed when i received my ""Book"" was just a little pamplet and the recipes were not that interesting. Sorry I bought it. If I was able to see the booklet before i purchased it, I would have not ordered it. I was so mad, I tossed it in the trash that night. Sorry about this unfavorable review but it's the truth."
2,"This ""book"" is more like a pamphlet","The recipes looked pretty good but this is a very small, flimsy publication that was more of a pamphlet than a book. Since it was a gift, I was a little embarrased when it arrived."
3,persnickety,I'm not sure why negative feedback was posted on 10/30/04 against Markham's book...when his book was released on 11/02/04. Sounds like someone needs to get on with their life!
3,NIHONJIN!,"So, being the Phantom Phreak that I am, I had to buy this. Don't be fooled by the other reviews on this item! It's not bad, but it's not great either. The chick that plays Christine is just not cut out for the part. Her voice is so weak! She can't hit the proper notes and she just sounds rather unpleasant. Raoul sounds like a woman. His voice is much too high. And our Phantom? He's not bad. His voice is a lot deeper than most other performers, but it's a nice change. The instruments are average, nothing wow but they sound fine. I would suggest maybe buying forom an amazon seller and not from amazon itself, their price is much too high for this recording. I would definately not spend $50. I got mine brand new through caiman.com, who is still a current amazon seller. Hope this helps!"
5,surprised by quality,An excellent book for giving your young students a glimpse into the Renaissance. It is very well written and a shame that it is still not in print. Grab one for your home school library if you can.
1,do NOT waste your money,"this cost seven dollars for a few paragraphs that is just a review . I thought it was a digital copy of the book. What a rip off, first and last time for me."
2,"Easy to use, until you have to print it out!","I love the idea of this product, and I loved working with it. I created a great layout that looked fabulous on screen. But unless you have an Epson printer, it is very difficult to print out a great copy. My hp deskjet could not handle the supplied photo paper, so a friend printed on his Lexmark for me. It worked better, but still had a few problems. More paper should be included in the package in case of printing problems because after several printing problems, we ran out of paper and I could not find the same photo paper in any store; I ended up buying a second package just to get more of the same paper.Next time, I will make a book using the ofoto site -- much more professional looking (2-sided) and just as cheap."
4,Great book but could still be better,"I recently purchased and completed my first book using StoryTeller. It was fun to produce, a bit tedious and labor intensive but the result was a beautiful book.It would be nice if the book could use two-sided paper and thus look more like a real book. That might be difficult to accomplish. On the other hand it would be easy to offer more than one font for captions, titles and such. It would also be nice to have more control with captions such as italizing or underlineing individual words. The buyer should be aware that this produces a very large file and even a fast computer is slowed considerably.Regardless of minor drawbacks, I think it is a great product and I'll probably buy several to use as very personalized Christmas gifts."
3,For those who wonder why,"This is a largely a how-to book written by a Jew for primarily a Jewish audience. The primariy focus is on the order of prayer as used through the use of a Siddur. I found the background to why certain traditions exist interesting (my primary motive for reading it), but found the many chapters devoted to what order certain aspects are performed on what occasions taxing. In fairness, this is primarily because I'm not Jewish, not because of the writing. However, for the Jewish person wondering why they do certain things at certain times, this book will prove to be very educating.I did find the discussion of how the certain traditions relate to the Bible or the Torah a bit lacking, since the text largely is devoted to syntax and order of the tradition, not the reasons. In summation, for a Jewish reader, this book will prove to be extremely helpful for your studies. For the non-Jewish reader, unless you are scholarly this may not be the best choice for you."
3,Not great---Not bad,"This is a good ""Emilio Estevez"" movie. He has had some stinkers, but don't include this one... Good movie for a cold or rainy day when you are caught indoors. Good moral lesson for youngsters, although they probably won't pick up on it."
4,Brett's opinion,"This is a great memory from the 80's. Not the quality film that some of the other's from that era are...but still a good idea for a movie. It was unique and I had forgotten that it was directed by Estevez. Additionally, a great early role for Demi. It was worth the cost and it is part of Warner's ""Archives"" films that are somewhat hard to find these days."
5,Waited so long.,I loved this movie the first time I saw it. I have wait years for this movie to be converted to DVD and available for less than $20.
5,Mans love show,"One of the best movies of its time, I would compare it to Bonnie and Clyde. And a surprise ending that I didn't see coming."
5,Dream of being hero,"This movie is astounding and awesome to watch, the ending will surprise you. I feel like I can relate to this movie. Its about a young man at 23 who isntbad on the inside just made one mistake by driving a stolen car while intoxicated and while he tries to make good and try to get a job somewhere his attempts are thwarted by his past record. society never learns to forgive when you make a mistake wheather it is towards a person or to yourself. I feel bad for emilio estevezs character because I was in a similar situation where a woman got so angry with me about something and eight years have gone by and she still cant forgive or accept my apology. It seems the only choice he had was to become a hero for the people in this day and age who doesnt dream of becoming a hero. Demi moore is great in her role as his girl and partner. The plot twist in the end was great it turned out to be a dream it ends the same way it started great movie hope it sells well on dvd."
4,Nature strikes back!!! (sort of),"This is a syfy movie but it's not a joke or parody it's an actual serious sci-fi/horror movie. It's basically a riff on The Ruins except no teenagers and less production values. You have the same set-up as all these types of syfy movies with a team being assembled to go find some ancient artifact then it awakens some type of ancient evil. It's watchable, the cgi isn't awful on the ""creature"", and the acting is pretty good for this type of movie. Definite rental if you feel like watching a monster tree rip people in half; who doesn't?"
1,You want to see a GREAT movie?,This isn't it. A friend of mine rented this piece of garbage and I watched it. I'm glad I didn't rent it. A bunch of crazy jungle tribe natives capture people and sacrificing them to a very bad special effect jungle god. You know what is scary? Not the movie but the fact that some people out there that might actually enjoy this time waste.
5,best plant movie yet,"mandrake is an awesome movie it has gore,action,and guns.the gore part is cool like a vine going throuh the guy's chest and blood splaters everywhere.the action part is the running scenes like the three people getting away from the plant.the gun part has pistols and submachine guns also a rife AWESOME!and you have to give this movie some credit because it ended in a happy way so give it some credit,PLEASE!"
4,Lee Ritenour - Smoke N' Mirrors,I am biased being a huge fan of Lee Ritenour. I was hooked when i heard Harlequin in 1984. The New album is Typical Lee with some uptempo pieces and some ballads with the occasional vocal song. His playing just keeps getting better like wine that ages. If you are a fan this is a must have and hopefully it will grab some new fans along the way. Highly recommended..
5,Leee Ritenour in top form,"Probably one Lee's best albums. An interesting international flavour, biased towards South Africa gives an exciting change to the latin influences that runs through much of his work. If you like Smooth Jazz with good tunes then this is top notch. Excellent musicianship and v ery good sound recording. If I say as I expected don't be disappointed, its just the consistent high standards that he sets for his work. A must have."
4,Excellent CD,"Very good CD, as a fan of Ritenour's work, i could say this is much better than Rit's House."
2,****AVERAGE ****,"I am a huge fan of Lee since 1979 and have bought every album since then. contrary to what you read above this album is a disappointment for me. Lee is into 'african' at the moment so lots of tribal beats in background if you're into that. There's a great line-up of musicians but unfortunately even they cant do much with the music. The african girl sings Lovely Day - pretty good - makes it her own song. Lee's son plays drums but can't hear any drumming(!) - maybe on the final master they cut out his track? and supposedly co-writes one song. Dave Grusin and Lee plays in Lovely Days with some glimses of Harlequin album - well almost. Patrice Rushen background sings her song Forget me nots - but unfortunately not memorable unlike her original hit in the 80's. Overall nothing memorable and no tunes you can hum along. For this listener, I'll go back to listening to the truly great music from the earlier albums."
2,Smoke 'N Mirror,This was given to my niece who loves jazz. I hope she will enjoy it fora Christmas gift. Her christmas gift was just delivered over the weekend.
3,funny - visualize Rockwell in the character,and the other actors (if you're savvy enough to know them).
1,down so long -> the one downside of the record,"I gave the song one star just to get attention, but I do think that it certainly isn't one of her best recordings. And she also irritates me sometimes with her curling of the mouth thing she is used to display on stage. The album is fine, it contains enough good songs to be recommended. As far as her spiritualism goes, I don't think that you can save the world by giving everyone a candybar."
1,don't buy it,"Do not buy this because the studs do not stay attached to the ring, and will be easily lost. Once the studs are lost, the key ring is useless and unless you return it promptly, you will not get a refund."
1,Gratuitous,"A film that attempts to make an interesting story of 'a day in the life' of a nudist beach in South Australia. It comes off like a half-hearted soap opera and the actors would best have left their swimming suits on for as much titillation as there is! There are many better examples of good Australian drama films from recent years, suggest 'Lantana'."
1,Boring,"Don't bother wasting your time - unless you are an Aussie and can relate, but even then you would probably be reaching for the remote after 5 minutes."
3,Good warmup 4afternoon delight,"Movie displays great real people T&A at scheduled intervals. That and the beautiful beach unfortunately was the best part of the movie!. I never did figure out what all the short choppy story lines were about. However I did stop and ponder over some of the close-ups. Having been to Australia twice I saw few beaches that did not have ""legacy"" squatter huts. This nude Australian beach was beautiful with no distractions"
4,Maslin beach,A delightful little Aussie movie with a typical Aussie approach towards nude beaches and humor. Beautiful people and lots of good laughs makes it worth a look.Frank E.
1,Not worthy of the AFI,"The premise of the film spells out the only reason why this film may have had any popularity whatsoever: ""A day in the life of a nudist beach"". GO FIGURE!There is no plot to be found whatsoever, the actors cannot act and are not even much to look at with their clothes off! In fact twenty minutes into the film you'll wish they'd cover up with at least a pair of speedos.Set on the real-life Adelaide nudist beach of Maslin Beach in South Australia, you'll find yourself wondering if all the producers did was take a hidden camera down there for the day and video the dreary lot who frequent said beach.PLEASE save your money and don't be tempted by the tittilation you will NOT find on this DVD!"
2,TWO STARS ONLY FOR THE STORY LINE,"Quite frankly, I was embarrassed for all the blokes that decided to do this movie 'au naturel'. If I were equipped as little as all of them were, I certainly would never have done a nude movie that's for sure. Thank goodness the cameras caught very few close-up shots of their private parts!For the storyline, I must admit that it was kind of OK. A bit stupid in some segments, but OK. Definitely not one to add to one's DVD library like I did. Put it at the back of the stack if you do decide to buy it. I would suggest if this is your cup of tea, rent it first."
2,The editing ruined this story,"The version I read was a reprint 2011, so I don't know if there were changes to the original, but whoever edited this cut out at least two scenes which would have made much more sense if left in the story, because towards the end, there's a conversation the couple has referencing the missing events. This also lacks Laurens' signature rich descriptions. Very disappointed."
1,Dreadful dreadful reading,"I beg Gayle Hendrix to read her next book in her own American accent - or take lessons from Barbara Rosenblat for english pronunciation lessons (an American who speaks the Queen's English better than most of us who actually live here). Hendrix got herself totally in a knot trying to use the upper class english ah sound instead of ay or a. Add that to a whole host of other mispronunciations and it was badly distracting. She was also very hesitant, the words never flowed and she accented the ends of words as if she had a choirmaster conducting her. The story itself isn't one of Stephanie Laurens best, although pleasant enough, but it would have been greatly improved by a competent reading. I will avoid Hendrix in future."
3,Not Read Yet,"I haven't read the book yet so I really can't tell you if I liked it. Hopefully, it'll be as good as Ms. Laurens other books."
3,"Average by comparison, but not so bad on its own","This 1974 Bond movie was far from great, and the return of John Barry as composer couldn't really pull this film out of the mire, but the soundtrack was not that bad. The lyrics to the main song are not Bacharach, and Lulu is no Shirley Bassey, but it's not totally dreadful. (Arguably, Lulu is not for the squeamish.) The overall feel of the album is that it captures a dangerous adventurous atmosphere, unlike most of the predecessors which had atmosphere AND personality. But if you want to sip cognac in a smoking jacket and pretend you're a retired field agent, this is good background listening music. (Oops, pardon the slide whistle in the middle of ""Let's Go Get 'Em."" Bet that bit let's you know not to take this pretending too seriously!)"
3,Q: Why do we buy the soundtracks?,"A: Because we liked the music in the film. The score of ""The Man with..."" is not much better or worse than that in most of the other films, and the CD doesn't include any more of the music than the other CD's do, but give the producers some credit. My biggest complaint about the soundtrack to ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" is the omission the military version of ""Nobody Does It Better."" At least the soundtrack to ""The Man with ..."" contains the player-piano version of the title song. For that alone I would give it an extra half-star if the scale allowed it."
3,A VERY ODD SOUNDTRACK.,"The title song sung by LULU is a little odd, but still O.K. Tracks like 7 and 9 are exciting but track 9 starts out with very corny music but later on gets exciting. Track 10 is beautiful, but gets spooky later on. Tracks 2, 10, and 11 are good but drag on a bit. Track 4 is very dumb, but this is only an O.K. soundtrack. Weird at times, it delivers a good arrangement of music with hardly any missing tracks. If you want to buy this, read the reviews first but don't judge it all on reviews. Because the reviews aren't exactly what you will find the CD to be like."
2,Weak is the word,"Who says Bond music says John Barry. Barry composed the music to 11 007 adventures thus creating a bulk of incredibly good film music. However, of 11 scores one must be the weakest. It's this one. Barry only got 2 weeks to write the score to this weak film, with weak lyrics by Don Black, and a weak singer called Lulu. This all said, the soundtrack album is pretty weak. Lots of eastern rimram in too jolly a mood. Only Getting the bullet and the music heard during the trip from HongKong to the QE 1 (can't remember the track name) are worthwhile, the rest is utterly boring, boring, BORING. Buy other Bond soundtracks."
1,Bad bad song,"Lulu. Bond title song. What were they thinking. The song is so bad, the lyrics horrible, that I can't bring myself to like the rest of the score. Nuff said."
3,The battle that's not complete,"I enjoyed listening to the battles but D.J Red Alert forgot to include Kool Moe Dee on CD. That's one of the best battles of all time. Also,D.J Red Alert cut off the ending verse of UTFO and The Real Roxanne."
5,Absolutely fabulous!!,"What an amazing musician. If you love the sound of a slide, this music is for you. I strongly reccommend it."
5,Really worth the money,"I bought a pair of these scissors almost twenty years ago to use with my child, and they have lasted and stayed sharp. We still use them to trim our nails. I love them so much, I've bought them as baby gifts over the years. I highly recommend them. I had other baby scissors, which were highly rated, but didn't come close to the precision of these. I recommend ""dusting"" your baby's fingers with a little cornstarch or powder, so you can see where the quick ends to cut more safely."
5,great scissors!!!,"I bought these scissors when my first grandchild,now eight years old,was born. Since then I have bought 14 scissors . I give them to my friends when they announce they are having their first grandchild. Every single new mother I have given them tojust love Rubis Scissors!!"
5,You won't forget this one!,"This is a great example of probably the most reliable publishers of mysteries - Mysterious Press - project of republishing forgottenmystery classics.Charlotte Armstrong in THE CASE OF THE WEIRD SISTERS creates that uncanny feeling of terror, of anxious fear, so difficult to accomplisheffectively to achieve a suspense driven novel that will tear an afternoon away from you and in exchange give you one of the best mystery reading experiences you are likely to have for some time to come.Three cheers for this Mysterious Press's gift to all of us - you won't forget this one."
2,Valve rates low,"this valve is of very poor quality and does not perform as expected. The brass housing is ok but the inner mechanism is poorly fitted plastic which will not hold up to much use and does not seal and leaks when in use, not what you want from a ""fuel"" valve."
4,Good part at a good price.,Received the part as it was advertised. Haven't had it long enough to determine how well it will last. It looks to be well constructed but looks to have a nylon or teflon ball valve. We will have to see how well that holds up.
1,"no color, no embedded local maps","The Kindle version is disappointing, no color, no embedded local maps, just references to Michelin Maps. Well, the cover is in color, as an iPod user I feel deceived"
1,Frustrating! Incomplete index,"Using this book can be very frustrating. Rather than being organized alphabetically, the book is organized by region, which has its advantages and disadvantages. But with the guide's incomplete index, this is extremely frustrating. For instance, if you want to read up on Annecy, Lac du Bourget or Chambery, all of which rate multiple Michelin stars, you will not find them in the index. So after looking in the index and not finding them, you have to go find the table of contents. What is the name of the region? A for Alps? No such category. So you scan the table of contents trying to find the appropriate category - ah, there it is - FRENCH Alps! And yes, there you can find Annecy and the page number.All in all, an experience that is bound to raise your blood-pressure. Avoid this book!"
5,Dependable reference guide,"I have found all Michelin products to be invaluable when planning a trip. Hotels and Restaurants are rated, and while I've run into a very few clunkers in the restaurant recommendations, I've found the recommended hotels were well described, very clean, and mainly, that I never would have known about without the Guides.Both the Green Guide and the Red Guide are dependable and useful. I highly recommend both."
3,caveat emptor,"A disappointing purchase. It's more a catalogue of French cities than it is a guidebook. If you're a Michelin Green Guide fan and headed for France, you're better off buying the individual guides for the several areas of the country, i.e. Paris or the Auvergne or Normandy, etc."
2,Surprisingly Bad,"You'd think Michelin, a French company, would write an excellent guide to its home country. You'd be wrong, unless you consider information about accomodation and places to eat to be superfluous, which this guide does.What does it contain? Lots of brief explanations of every last tourist site in France. In an effort to be inclusive, it has failed to prioritize, resulting in minor attractions being given nearly the same coverage as major ones. Yes, they rate things using their three-star system, but it's just not enough to distinguish the worthwhile from the merely amusing.The only reason the book merits two stars is the suggested walks provided for various cities.From now on I'm sticking to Lonely Planet. Their guides may be weighed down by unnecessary PC editorializing, but they give you enough logistical information to find places to eat and sleep."
4,"Great grammar explanations, pretty complex","I really like this book, but I'm a linguist and don't really consider myself a novice. Although I'm a beginner in Lithuanian, I'm not a beginner in studying languages, so the complex explanations weren't too hard to grasp. If you enjoy studying languages and want a complete grammar explanation, then I definitely recommend this book. However, if you're looking for a simple understanding and just want to pick up a few words to get by, this is NOT the book for you."
4,Beginner's Lithuanian,"A must to try to grasp the Lithuanian language, one of 2 baltic languages left."
2,This book needs to be updated.,"This book needs to be updated from its original edition from the 1960s. I also think it needs to be more colorful and the dictionary in the back of the book more extensive. This book is recommended for grammar gurus because it focuses extensively on sentence constructions and grammar. Lithuanian is a very hard language to write and speak and this book doesn't make it any easier to learn. However, this is the only book to learn Lithuanian and it does stress correct grammar. But it is very old fashioned and needs some color and liveliness. Learning a language is supposed to be fun and this book makes it more like work."
3,"Inspires to visit NZ, but without the author","I purchased this book because I enjoy reading personal accounts of travel as a jumping off point to plan my own trips. The best of these books inspire you to visit the described locations and wish that the author could travel with you.Although I enjoyed the descriptions of New Zealand and the Kiwis, the tone and attitudes of the author made me hope that I would never meet him, in New Zealand or elsewhere. Because of this limitation, I am extremely unlikely to re-read this book. Once is enough time of my life to spend with Mr. Elder.If you are looking for an entertaining travel book from an author you may still like as a person at the end of the book, I strongly recommendIn a Sunburned Countryby Bill Bryson. I've read this book cover to cover at least twice and will occasionally pick it up just to read a chapter at random. I find it funny and informative at the same time."
1,Not very useful,"This book was not at all useful as a travel guide. It's not very useful as a story either. The author is self involved, self important and describes things we'd rather not know, like his sexual exploits (just look at his picture and you'll know why). He's into wine, women and cigars in a very annoying way. He complains a lot and seems to have an inability to roll with the punches. He is basically a sexist bore. Look elsewhere for a better read and info on New Zealand."
3,Insightful if sometimes grumpy,"Elder offers helpful insights for travelers to NZ with heavy emphasis on good wines and comfortable bed and breakfast places. He is definitely a city boy, not a naturalist. From time to time he gets a bit snarky and is particularly fond of recounting his triumphs over those who fail to meet his expectations. For a guy who tolerates few mistakes, he makes a few of his own. For instance a fabric sample is a swatch (not a snatch) throughout the English-speaking world. I'm glad he explains that NZ is too cold for growing good red wine grapes but produces splendid white wines."
5,A Beautiful Book,"I just finshed reading this journal/remembrance/travel guide and I have to say it's been some time since I enjoyed a non-fiction book as much as I did this one. Divided into chapters that detail roughly one day each, Mr. Elder's trip into the southern hemisphere's most enchanting country is rich with events like hikes in dense rain forests, boat trips along New Zealand's magnificent fjords, drives past the snow-capped southern Alps, and his trip along the cobbled streets of quaint, thoroughly English Christchurch. I can only hope my own experiences in New Zealand are half as wonderful and momentous as his turned out to be!"
2,Not particularly helpful if you are planning a trip to NZ,"Having just returned from a month-long trip to NZ, I had bought this book beforehand, hoping that it would provide me with some ideas or insight for my trip. Not possible. The author spent way too much time worrying (and whining) about the personal details of his homestays and dining arrangements. Do not buy this book if you want to plan a trip to NZ. It might be useful if you are interested in homestays, but only if you expect 150% from each homestay and are not ready to forgive the occasional idiosyncratic ways and needs of all human beings. The New Zealanders were mostly charming and engaging when we visited (July 2006). This book did not give that impression."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I purchased this book a month ago in preparation for our first trip to New Zealand. I am taking my family on this journey to celebrate the collage graduation of my two sons and my own retirement; therefore I was looking for positive and joyful accounts of this fabulous country. The writer of this book, Alexander Elder, presents New Zealand from the view of a stuffy opinionated older man, with little tolerance for others while lighting up his cigars and drinking his wines. I have not been able to finish the book due to frustration that it continues to not only miss the information I need but also presents what I feel is a narcissistic tale of Elder's travels, his other ""best selling books"" as well as his speaking engagements. I will not be reading further."
3,Interesting tale,I had expected more out of this book than I got. I suppose it was a bit off putting to be reading about a wealthy guy's travel when I couldn't afford most of what he did. I did appreciate some insights about places even though I'd have to visit them on a lower budget.
1,broke in a week,"It worked great for a whole week, the it just stopped completely. At least it was inexpensive and not worth the trouble trying to send it back for a refund."
2,"Ignacy was not the best pianist, and here is the evidence.","Paderewski was often derided by critics and other pianists of his day for the poor taste and Romantic exaggeration of his playing. This 2-CD set has the recorded evidence of the validity of these accusations on every track. Thus, it is a valueable document for teachers and players to show how someone famous, who could play all the notes and had a stellar career, could be a bad interpreter and performer.His ""feeling"" for Romantic repertoire was so eccentric that he makes some of the pieces sound like early jazz or ragtime. To hear it is to believe, and, if you believe in the myth of I.P as a great artist, prepare to have your bubble burst. If you want to confirm what history has generally said about I.P's musicality, this set is perfect. If you like the music, buy another, ANY, other recording.MBB"
3,Paderewski is gone for a reason...,"The recordings are fine and the playing is mediocre. He misses notes or total parts(simplification) and there are so many false notes its a shamble. The man was famous, but its pretty obvious he has no control after becoming a concert pianist when he was a full grown adult. If you want a real artist go for Hoffmann, Rachmaninoff, or at least somebody who is remembered for their great playing, not image. I give it a three because of his mediocre playing(one star for the playing and two for the fancy jacket)..."
3,OverHaulin' Season 1,"I still have not received this DVD box set since it was ""Media Mail"" shipped to be on September 15, 2009.I'm surprised this online seller isn't familiar with how long this type of shipping to Hawaii takes and theyshould make some type of disclaimer in it's shipping rates. I would have gladly paid extra to have it shippedpriority mail if I had known."
1,Where's the BEEF?,"Seriously, how could anyone believe watching a bunch of jerks sitting at a table saying nothing for ten minutes be entertaining? I don't know or care who is directing this show, but I think whoever it is would do a much better job at bussing tables at a fast food joint...."
4,Touching acount of the killing fields,"This book really moved me. Sometimes the writing was not great, but most of the time I was intrigued by what had happened to these people. The best acount in my mind is the last one, ""The Tonle Sap lake massacre. If you are interested in Cambodia, or in tales of survivors, get this book."
3,Repetitive but must be told,"The book is full of tragic stories that must be told, but is quite repetitive, and one feels that many of the stories are written with rather alot of assistance and therefore lose the genuine feeling and the language they were told in. The reader should remember that each person has a unique story, and that these are not necessarily representative of the stories of Cambodians or even Cambodian Americans as a whole."
2,Tragic and revolting. Repetitive and poorly written.,Probably enlightening (and in that sense important) for those who don't know their Cambodian history. Otherwise the book contains mostly more repulsive details of the atrocities the Cambodian people comitted against its own people.Poor quality concerning the written word. That these people are not real authors is painfully apparent. The book is repetitive and shallow. What happened to the editor?I would rather have seen one or two of these people write there whole experience instead of so short accounts from so many people. It doesn't feel complete somehow.

2,NIce...but!,"This mandolin is beautiful . Too bad I can't get it tuned. I even bought a new tuner to tune this thing, but no dice."
4,great for quick storage of toys,"We keep this very bright tote in our front room...the baby's front room now and it is excellent for storing all of her growing toy supply. It really is not rigid so she can easily go into it and pull her toys out by herself, crawl into it, stare at herself in the mirror or pick it up and toss it around. It is sturdy yet flexible. It was great for our recent trip. Instead of picking out a bunch of toys to take I just picked up the full tote of toys and shoved it in the car. Not too bad for the price. If you're looking for something bright but not as rigid as a wooden or plastic toy box this may be a tote for you."
1,One died after 3 minutes,"I ordered two of these to replace the bulbs in our bathroom. One of the bulbs lit up only very dimly when it was turned on, and a few minutes later, went out completely, and smelled of burning plastic. I quickly removed the bulb from the socket and found that it was hot and had become discolored. The other bulb is still working.The color of the light from the other one is more sterile (green/white)than the incandescent bulbs I replaced, perhaps a better choice for a kitchen than a bathroom."
3,Not Quite As Bright,I have 3 sunken light fixtures in the kitchen for spot illumination. I replaced a 50 watt incandescent flood light bulb with one of these. It does the job but does not provide as much light as the other.
1,Short Life Span,"They don't outlast 8-10 incandescent bulbs as claimed. My experience they last about the same. I swapped out my entire house last summer, about 40 bulbs altogether, 5 are still working. So I'm back to using incandescents. I do recall ever replacing so many burned-out bulbs. I'm all for saving energy but more work on the technology needs to be done before I jump in again."
5,GRREEAAATTTT!!!,I HEARD THIS SONG @ 7:00AM AT A CLUB IN ATLANTA CALLED BACKSTREET. OFF THE CHAIN!!!.. EVERYONE I KNOW THAT'S HEARD THIS SONG MUST HAVE IT.....
2,No suspense at all until the very end,"This movie would have been better if they had let you see the creature sooner. It takes over an hour before you get a good look at it and by then at least 5 people are already dead. When the insect makes its appearance it's not bad for a low budget movie. This makes the last 15 minutes of the movie exciting. Unfortunately the first hour plus is boring. None of the characters are particularly interesting and neither is all the talk about illegal drilling techniques. At least four people are killed before anyone takes notice, including the doctor who was in charge. Their needed to be more suspense and a better idea of what kind of creature they were dealing with earlier in the movie."
4,Great Baby Sitters' Club Movie!,I liked this movie because it was interesting when the baby sitters spied on people. The actors really bring the book's characters to life in a fun way. If you like the Baby Sitters' Club books you'll love this movie.
5,"Tony , tells it like it is","If you are having problems in your life, then read this book. It covers a wide range of subjects. In fact I'm going to write Tony Evans and let him know what a impact that the book made in my family."
2,Educational but dated,"This publication has much information on the subject, but sadly much of it is very dated. Had I realised just how out of date the subject matter was, would not have purchased."
4,Mellow Mut Dog Treats,"My dog loves them, and buying them in bulk here is much cheaper than the high-end pet supply stores that sell organic-only pet foods. Still waiting for the ""mellow"" part to kick in, though."
4,I wish...,"...I could write in such strange episodic, schizoid events, falling toward the sexual (non erotic), the political (perhaps personal and still real today) and the imaginatively -- writing in a style that makes me want to take an ice bath and thank the author for having the guts to purge this out in the print world, the word world. Oh well, it's 2013 and they don't make them like they used to."
1,bad quality,"The table looks good. However when I received it, one of the leg was already broken into two pieces. It looked like someone broke it on purpuse. It is either poor quality or poor inspection from the manufacturor part."
1,Poor craftsmanship and incorrect parts,"The item had a couple obvious defects. There was a small hole on the top board, and a crack running along the edge of the lower board.Also, and maybe I was just assembling it wrong, but after affixing the legs to the top board, the bottom board was too small to fit into the carved notches."
2,Looks good but broke during assembly,"It looks great for a cheap table. However, when installing the bottom shelf (and this happened on BOTH tables - I ordered 2), one of the screws didn't take to the pre-drilled hole and so the bottom shelf is only connected by 3 points no 4. Of course this renders the shelf useless and the whole table is wobbly. I'm hopig using a longer screw and maybe some L-brackets will be a good DIY fix.Due to the poor construction, I'd say it's not worth the price."
2,wait for second printing,This is a nice book which deserved a betterproofreading before going to press. In itscurrent incarnation it is marred with numeroustypos not only in the text but in the exercisesas well. It can be very frustrating when thereader is essentially asked to guess the author'sintentions. My advice to prospective buyers is towait for the second printing when these errorswill hopefully be cleaned up.
4,A sensitive and sensible readable contribution,"This is a question-and-answer format guide written for a general readership, covering almost every aspect of death and bereavement in today's society. Dr. Carroll is wise, compassionate and nuanced; he gives balanced advice, and avoids polemics and slogans. I have used this book as a text for a college-level ""death and dying"" course, and it works wonderfully. Because it was last revised in 1991, there are some things that are out of date. Changes is the laws about Living Wills is one example of this. Yet its basic relevance remains, and since the topic is of continuing public interest, Dr. Carroll's text helps ground the more recent, public debates within a humane foundation. He consistently values communication, relationships among people, and trust between patients and their doctors, and uses these ideals to respond to a wide range of specific questions about dying, illness and bereavement."
2,Supply lines do not have standard size connectors,"OMG the supply line has a 7/8"" connector. Not standard at all. We are either going to have to rig this or return this. I am curious how the 1st reviewer installed theirs and how they connected to the incoming water supply lines/valve."
4,Love this series,I love this National Geographic series. I still watch this and season one. Shows some of what the agents do in their daily fight to protect our borders. A nice look into their job.
4,The truth,"All you conservative types who bellow about an ""open border"" with Mexico, please watch this one. You couldn't be more wrong. Want to see an open border? Check the Canadian border."
4,The truth,"Any of you conservative types who talk about an ""open border"" with Mexico, watch this one. You will see just how foolish and wrong that statement is when it relates to the Mexican border. There is an open border in this country--the one with Canada, but I guess that one doesn't count."
4,Just Right....,"This is a great little feel good show. It sets out to tell the story of a Yakuza heiress who becomes a High School teacher and it does just that, no more or less. It's not particularly flashy or creative but succeeds in telling a straightforward simple story. The character types are familiar but not at all boring and they're instantly likeable. Especially our lead character Kumiko Yamaguchi, otherwise called ""Yankumi"" by her students. Fitting of a Yakuza heiress, Kumiko is a kick butt badass who will sacrifice anything for her students. The animation is very nice for a thirteen episode series, surprisingly better than I expected. If you want to watch something light and short to kill some time you should try out The Gokusen.The set comes with a neat red jacket similar to Kumiko's with the words ""The Gokusen"" printed on it. There's a slight glitch on the first dvd, at one point the subtitle timing is completely off but it corrects itself quickly. Overall not a bad buy."
4,Gokusen cartoon,"If you're a student or a school teacher, this anime is quite funny.I caught part of this series on Encore a couple of years ago, and watched the drama online. If you're used to the drama, be aware that the language used for the English dub of the cartoon isn't very suitable for kids, and also lacks the footnotes on yakuza jargon common to the fansubs. After the drama, the cartoon just isn't very satisfying, but it is what got me hooked on this series in the first place."
3,Parents beware,"While the show itself is pretty decent and the price right now is superb ($15 for 3 disks!), I just wanted to make sure any parents who might want to buy this for their kids to save their money. The first couple of episodes feature illustrations of breasts and there are a whole lot of swears all through the series, especially of using God's name in vain.I'm not trying to make an issue out of anything, if thats what you like then fine (the characters depicted are mobsters and last-chance high school kids after all). I just don't want parents unknowingly giving this to their kids thinking its just another show. Thats the only reason I can't rate it higher - it was a good show, but there really is no reason for all of that.I only watched the english dub, not the subtitles so that may be cleaner, I doubt it though."
5,JOHN BARRY and the Enigmatic MOONRAKER,"Watching ""MOONRAKER"" the other night I never realized how well structured this film was crafted. If, what some would call objectionable juvenile elements were removed, what remains is a quintessential Bond movie with Roger Moore turning in his best performance as 007.It is of interest how John Barry scored this film. The score represented on the album concentrates on the virtues of the main character, the spectacle and the action at hand. Barry never reverts to or even hints to the ""James Bond Theme"" on this album. He relies more on the character's endearing and enduring qualities. We can hear Bond as the romantic hero, spy and adventurer. We also hear the beautiful passages of earthly and unearthly encounters. Some of the score contains a yearning for the enigmatic meaning of life itself. It is a very unusual score for a film that has deep unfathomable undertones hidden beneath its gloss. This score matches the film perfectly."
4,PRETTY GOOD SOUNDTRACK.,"Hey dude from SEATTLE, WASHINGTON that wrote a review titled Berlin...Only Better; I have this soundtrack too. I have every single 007 soundtrack except for FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. Anyways, this soundtrack is pretty good. Tracks 2 and 6 are good. They have great space music. 6 especially has good music. Track 4 is action packed, and track 3 is a good instrumental of the title song. Shirley Bassey returns once again to perform her final James Bond title song. It is a good title song. All in all this is a good soundtrack and has great music. But minus one star for missing tracks."
2,Do not Buy!,"I think that this soundtrack is the worst! (next to Goldeneye) What the soundtrack needed was the James Bond Theme (it was in the pre-credits and boat chase) the movie was very good in my opinion, but the soundtrack is missing heaps of the good stuff that is in the movie!!!!"
3,A Different Kind of Medical History,"Richard Gordon, author of ""Doctor in the House"" and other books in the ""Doctor"" series, turns to medical history here. But unlike most other books that usually focus on the triumphs of medicine, this one is a catalog of disasters. It is a potpourri of quirky anecdotes. You can read about such items as the London surgeon Robert Liston who prided himself on being quick and amputated a leg under 2 1/2 minutes (and the fingers of his assistant as well), about Sir William Lane who was so obsessed with constipation that he began to remove his patients' large intestines the way others removed appendixes, and how Britain developed an anthrax bomb to combat Hitler's Germany. But while many anecdotes themselves make for hilarious or shocking reading, after a while they begin to grate a bit. Although grouped into sections, there does not seem a strong unifying thread. Perhaps the book might have more appeal if read in installments rather than from cover to cover."
4,Diary of a City Priest,"This movie has such an ""indie"" feel. David Morse is a chameleon and does a fantastic job with his work, no matter what the part. Gives a realistic view of the priest and the city. I gravitate towards this type of movie as opposed to the ""normal"" Hollywood type. Photography was excellent; it really set the mood. The movie was thought-provoking and I enjoyed it."
5,Great Series,"The Bed-and-Breakfast series from beginning to end has been highly enjoyable entertainment and a pleasure to read. The settings, though realistic, always are a little off-center. The main characters are always amusing and so much like the people I see everyday. September Mourn takes the cousins to an unfamiliar place, both to them and me, and it is a pleasure to follow them as they chart new adventures. The plot is, as usual, also a little off-center and pushes the reader to think a little differently. A good read and a great series."
3,Murder on a remote island,"Once again Jude is conned into helping out an acquaintance, this time an old high school friend who owns a B and B in the Santa Lucia Islands. An obnoxious guest falls down the stairs and is found dead shortly after Renie hits him in the head with a dinner plate when he tries to steal her dinner. It turns out that he really died from a blow to the head, just not Renies. This contains the usual wierd group of characters and improbable mystery, but is very enjoyable none the less."
3,sorry....this isnt fair,"as much as i liked this & Leges Benedict, this one was...unfair, theres one clue at the end and then you get the killer's identity revealed, there are no clues, everything you get is a red herring, 'Judith' says she suspected the 'person' all along but bever once said that...excuse me? Oh, and my answer to Leg's made more sense that Mrs. Daheim's...i hope Holy Terror (my next venture) is a little...fairer to the reader"
1,No Care was taken when package was shipped,"If I could give this item, shipped by Jensen Distributing less than 1 star I would.This item not only arrived shattered in pieces, but it's replacement also arrived broken in several hundred pieces. The box contained no padding what-so-ever and there were no fragile warnings attached to the box.Amazon refused to ship a third tank out, citing ""Serious unresolved issues"" with the distributer.The shipper abviously has no clue on how to ship the ceramic products that they sell. Save yourself the time and fustration and avoid purchasing this or any product shipped by Jensen Distributing.Crane Plumbing Galaxy Lite 12-Inch Vitreous China Toilet Tanks #3652"
2,Not Good for Migraines,"I had an intractable migraine for over 200 days and was desperate to try anything for potential relief. This product did not relieve my migraine. It did, however, provide a pleasant burst of tingliness that got my sinuses draining. I plan to use it when my allergies are bothering me and/or if I am really stuffed up from a cold. It definitely gets things moving in your sinuses."
1,I Would Not Recommend Headache Buster To Anyone,"As A Migraine & Headache Sufferer, I Purchase Many Items That May Help Me Feel Better. As Soon As I Tried This Product It Knocked Me Off My Feet & Gave Me One Of The Worst Migraines I've Ever Experienced. It Was Like A Bomb Went Off In My Head.I Would Recommend WellPatch Cooling Migraine Patch Which Lasts Up To 8 Hours. It Is Lightly Scented With Menthol & Lavender Oil. As Soon As You Place The Cool Patch On Your Forehead You Start Feeling Relief. Best Wishes!"
2,Not what I ordered,"As the ""Item being reviewed"" states, I ordered Sinus Buster Headache and even though that is what my order slip stated too, I received the basic Sinus Buster product. Whether or not they are the same product I should have received the ""labeled"" product that I ordered. I kept the product because I didn't want the hassle or cost of returning it. In addition, I paid for overnight delivery so I could take the product on vacation with me. Because of some situation with the company (South Coast ?). It took 6 days (4 working days) to recieve. The product seems okay but I will not purchase anything again from South Coast..."
5,Just what I needed,"In the throes of a migraine cycle, I googled ""migraine remedy,"" and Sinus Buster came up. It sounded like exactly what I needed, (and I have tried it all.) Couldn't wait for it to come in the mail so I traveled to the only store in L.A. that carries Sinus Buster products. Immediate relief from a residual headache. That was about a month ago. Since then, anytime I felt a migraine coming on, I used the product. Admittedly, there were days when I had to use it frequently to ward off the onset. (No problem with Sinus Buster because it's non-addictive and you can't really overdose.) It worked every time, and now my cycle has vanished. I sent Sinus Buster to my sister, whose headaches are more frequent and more severe than mine. Again, wonderful results."
2,ehh didn't work for me,"well i'm not saying its not worth a try, it is, especially if ur like me and have headaches everyday and conventional medical treatments don't seem to be an effective (my neurologist put me on some meds and didn't do anything, so i decided to try this). The only bad side effect i've had is smelling blood shortly after use, and becoming congested after i used it, hopefully it fairs better for others that buy it than it did for me"
4,nice product head aches,this product works pretty well for the sinus head aches that I have had but not for other types of headaches though. That is fine. Sinus headaches are the worst and it is nice to have a product that helps.
3,Okay for temporary relief - a few minutes,"Althouth this may work for many people, It did not work for me. I got relief for a few minutes. Migraines are caused by many different reasons, so it may work for others.However, it did clear my sinusesThe spray is not as bad as I thought it would be, it was a little uncomfortable that's all. I am moving to other cures such as potassaium gluconate (spelling?) and calcium, they type that fizzes. This seems to work better.With all that said, I would not hesitate to try this product if I were a sinus or other type of headache sufferer."
1,Hot Pepper Opens Sinuses!,"This product has validity as a natural spray that really opens up the sinuses. As for it's Migrane Headache claims, it seemed to make a small difference in the severity of the pain for about 30 minutes. I ended up having to take the over the counter pain reliever to end the headache.On the up side, knowing that nothing works for all people, this company does stand by it's claim to refund if not satisfied. I'm thankful for that!I'm still looking for a natural cure for migranes!Signed: Hope-filled to Let Down."
4,Headache Buster works for many of my migraines,I've been using Headache Buster for over 3 years. It many times will stop a migraine before I need to use a stronger medicine like Sumatriptan. Since I can have almost daily migraines this is very important.
1,Didn't work for me..,"Chronic headache sufferer here. Headache Buster did not work for me. Not even a little bit of relief. Glad to hear it works for others, but no luck for me. On to the next one..."
5,Stanley at his best.,"This was a gift for my husband, who is a jazz lover. This is Stanley Turrentine at his best. We are from Pittsburgh, Pa. and La Place is a song where Stanley lived in the Hill Distict. This should be in everyones jazz collection."
4,The Stamp Atlas,"Exactly what I require...Nice clean second hand edition, could not ask for more.thanks"
3,"Good for SAT, but not the original version of Frankenstein","I ordered this book to use with my AP Literature class. I was already teaching Frankenstein, and thought that my students would really benefit from the extra SAT study as well. However, as we are going through the book, I find that the story in this book is very different from the old copies I had always taught from. Key parts of the story are changed, and many of the parts are rearranged. If you are looking for an accurate version of Mary Shelley's story, this may not be the one for you."
5,Awesome for Test Prep,"I loved this book. Not only does it repeatedly list definitions of valuable words on the opposide side of each page, but it also fully engages you in reading it. The story is very good. I used to love fiction when I was a kid, but I couldn't get myself to read fiction for about 10 years. Now that I am preparing for the GRE, I ended up picking up this book. The only regret I have is that the book is over.Btw, I LOVE not having to use a dictionary every two seconds to look up words. The book defines the same word several times, so by the end of the book a lot of them really stick."
2,Disappointed,"I thought I was helping my son. He was assigned to read Frankenstein by Mary Shelley for his English class. I found this copy on-line and it contained a glossary of words as you read. That seemed like a fantastic way to keep him reading and not stop to look up the words. What we found and rather late in the assignment was that the story was changed slightly in various places to accommodate the SAT words. If you are buying the copy for your child to read along with a class you may not want to purchase this copy of the story. If you want to improve your vocabulary, it would be a good purchase."
4,Unexpected,"Before I actually read Frankenstein, I held couple misconceptions. I thought that the monster's name was Frankenstein and that he was green and had metal screws studded into his head. However, after reading the book, I realized why it is considered a classic. The tales of both the scientist and his creation are equally disheartening and pitiful. The ambitious scientist pushed the limits and acted recklessly for his own interest. On the other hand, I ended up feeling sorry for the monster as well. He tried to be gentle but his isolation and rejection from other people ended up making him evil.This is definitely a story worth reading. It will help to buy this edition as well because the vocabulary words defined actually do help the story. This sounds nerdy but its much easier to get through with the story by glancing at words you do not know than just trying to guess the definitions."
5,Buy this version of Frankestein!!,"This book is an excellent version for any reader. Although it does not contain footnotes, it does offer definitions for all of the ""big words"" in the book so that it really makes it a quick read. It is an EXCELLENT tool for SAT/ACT Vocabulary prep with all of its definitions."
5,What I was looking for.,"A history of some of the ""pioneers"" of Montana. Personal accounts by those who lived there, or by those who remembered them. Of interest to those of us related to people profiled,"
3,effective,"These might have to be cut, ripped or torn to fit, depending which filter you have. That can be a hassle, but the filters do the job they're supposed to. (You can tell by how dirty they get.)"
3,Great for the amature bellydancer!,"I don't know that these zills would work for prefessional dancing, but they are great for someone just starting out."
1,Disappointing Collection,Although Mabel Mercer had a distinctive voice this collection of short songs -- most are less than 3 minutes--does not make for a worthwhile vehicle. She comes over at times like Margaret Dumont in the Marx Brothers films.
5,15 Amore,"""15 Amore"" is an excellent movie shown from the perspective of a child living in an Australian farm. The beauty of nature and the simplicity of life in the farm is contrasted with the darkness and hatred that rise from the remote Second World War. This darkness deeply affects, in different ways, most of the adult characters of the movie."
5,Great Condition for a Used Book,I received the book as described during the purchasing process. I also received it in fewer days than stated during checkout
2,working on a class,Bought it for a Graduate class. I wish more info was given if it came with or without DVD-or any accompanying materials that can be bought.
2,Not a great Kindle Version,"I recently spent $80 for theOperations Management Kindle Edition of this book and it's really not ready for primetime. I don't know what the publisher did, but there is mis-aligned text and graphics, random characters through the text and misspelled words, and this is only in the first chapter. Did anyone QA this thing?"
3,Operations Management,"I haven't finished it yet. But, for the most part it contains all the information I need and is relatively easy to read. However, I have run into at least one duplicated paragraph so far and I've only read to chapter three."
1,fake information,"the picture you shown is 11th edition, but i recieved a 10th edition textbook. you are cheating!!! how can you do this over and over again!!!"
1,KINDLE ED. NOT FOR KINDLE,"I bought this for a class and then couldn't get it to download to my Kindle. If you look closely, it's not available on Kindle. How stupid is that???"
1,MORE VAMPIRIC MISH-MASH FROM MELTON,"Melton starts off the book with a major mistake! In his review of ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN, he states Dracula (Bela Lugosi) is killed by sunlight! DUH! Hey, WATCH THE MOVIE! Dracula is killed by the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney, Jr.), as they both plunge off a balcony into the sea, Dracula (as a bat) clutched in the Wolf Man's claws. This just goes to show how sloppily researched and error-laden ALL of Melton's vampire books are. Buyers beware -- you can't trust the information in these books!"
3,"Slick, formula Barry with Location overtones","This is John Barry's 5th outing as Bond composer. Slick 60's fare, with however a surprising lack of the much desired 'James Bond Theme.' Since the movie is based in Japan, Barry has again gone out of his way to use traditional Japanese instruments and to give the score a very Far Eastern feel. (As he did with Turkish sounds in FROM RUSIA WITH LOVE, in 1963.)There are some particularly lovely melodies, especially 'The Wedding' and the swirling title tune (which appears several times).Nancy Sinatra's unemotional treatment of the title song is a plus.All in all, a good one for John Barry, which was to pave the way for his first masterpiece...'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' 2 years later."
2,tricked again,"i can't believe the companies can get away with advertising movies as uncut with their running times only to get the dvd and realize it's cut.don't get me wrong, i love these movies, but i already had them and i only got this double dvd because slumber party II was supposed to be uncut.it says right on the back of the dvd that the running time is 90 minutes, but when you check the movie out it's STILL 75 minutes!this has happened before with other movies and i'm sick and tired of it!it's plain out LYING to get people to pay out big bucks for these dvd's when they think they're getting something they aren't !that's all i gotta say :')"
5,Loved This Book,This is a great little book with amazing content. Both my husband and I read it and were truly fascinated with the information. Price is great!
3,THE GOOD THE BAD BUT NOT UGLY,"I thought the ending was unfullfilling and a little confusing, and that almost killed this series for me. However, it did still have the great animation and characters, and the action scenes were epic, as well as a happy ending amongst great sacrifice, which ultimatly redeemed this volume."
4,Hmmm...,"The book was pretty interesting, but the title was a littlemisleading. Even with the ""or so"" added to the title, onemight think of a book of pressure points, herbal remidies, and other alternative methods of healing. Must of the book is planning what you eat, and keeping diaries of what's going on, all long term things. The books does have a few things, but they are not nessarily completely developed. In the pain chapter, it says to find ""trigger points"", explaining that they are sevsetive areas, and that's really it...But htough it is week in some areas it is helpful, even though slightly mislead."
5,Best Coaster ever made,My husband and I enjoy our drinks with ice and it causes condinsation on the outside of the glass. I have used all kinds of coasters that either leave a puddle that when you pick up the glass it drips on you or a stain. These are fantastic as they soak up all the moisture and dry to look like you have never used the coaster. We started with a set of 4 and now we hav 12. I also give these as gifts and people rave over them and want to know where they can purchase them for gifts. You will never ever be sorry you purchased these coasters.
4,Get past the first few chapters and you will read to the end,"This story has it all for the PC gay metrosexual. Biracial gay couple. Tearjerking breakup. Dysfunctional relationships. Chickenhawking. World travel. Set in New York, San Francisco, and Indonesia, it is an easy read. One warning: the entire book, cover to cover, is formatted as a series of email exchanges. The first chapter is difficult because the email format is not conducive to character development, but eventually you'll figure out who all the players are."
1,Dreadful,"This book was a real snooze. Predictable characters, pseudo-amusing, ""clever"" and ""wise"" campy lines from the tired old queen who presides over the whole debacle, and a remarkably dull plot line. The author should have kept the manuscript in the desk drawer."
4,Some good music in there,There were a few music we thought were not appropriate for babies. One was a bit jazzy...definitely not classical. Otherwise it was good
5,"Classical, Jazz and Opera Bach all in one","This is a versatile collection in terms of composition, performance and layout. Comparing to most of CD with classical selections for baby, this edition is more nutritious and rich on musical experience. Genre wise, the piano solo, concerti, chamber and opera are all included. Performance wise, it is absolute a feast -- Sir Neville Marrier conducting Academy of St. Martin-in-the fields, Jazz Pianist John Lewis delivering the charming and uplifting variation, and Kiri Te Kanawa's heavenly creamy voice. The combination of these musicians and recordings is a decision with great artistic sensibility. The layout is perfectly arranged -- from the waking up, playtime and to the bed. This is not just another CD juggles some pieces together from a brandy composer. For a more serious editing of baby music, this shall be something as a guideline."
4,Great for Big Babies too,"I'm a student and I like to listen to classical music while I'm studying and this is great for that. It's lively enough not to put you asleep, but soft enough that it doens't distract from what you're studying. Plus, it's long enough that you don't have to get up to change the CD every 5 minutes."
4,My husband liked it..,"I bought this for my husband on his b'day and he liked it. I thought this might look big on his band as his arm wrists are little thin, but it was nice on his hand and not looking big at all. Though the dial size is 45mm(or 43mm, not sure) but since that it has got a tachymeter ring surrounding the dial, that makes the watch to suit even the thin wrists and it actually looks lot better than the one shown in the picture..."
1,Pages cut out,"This individual had pages at the end of chapters cut out and they didn't have the decency to at least put them where they belong. Upon getting the book I had to spend about 30minutes placing the cut-out pages where they belonged. If I wasn't already late in purchasing that book for school, I would have returned it immediately."
4,"Wow, awesome",My book arrive very quickly and it was in excellent condition. It arrived just in time for class. Thanks
4,BLAW complexity,"This book is very useful for learning the basics of business law, especially as it applies to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The authors of the text include many excerpts from real cases to help apply the fundamentals and see how they are executed in real life."
2,"Good Book, Slowest Delivery EVER from (textbooksnow)","This was the third of three books ordered from Amazon. The first two arrived well ahead of their estimated delivery date and I was extremely happy. The third book came from a seperate supplier and thats where the trouble started. It took them (textbooksnow) four days just to process the order. After that they changed the estimated delivery date from my selection when I ordered. I chose 5 to 8 day delivery, they changed it to 7 to 23 days. It arrived in 21 days from just three hours from where I live. I was 1 1/2 weeks into my class without a book before it came. I've had good luck with Amazon and their book sales up until it came from (textbooksnow). I'll make sure I screen my order better from now on and make sure they are not involved in the order process. It's not worth the time lost, when you need your books for class and have to beg and borrow to get the info you need until it finally arrives."
2,Poor quality,"It should have been described as very poor. The cover was totally separated from the pages. Packing for delivery was also very poor because by the time it got here, it was pretty much without packing."
4,muy divertido,"este articulo es muy delicado, sin embargo proporciona mucha divercion y posibilidades, no es muy resistente pero me gusto mucho.... recomendado pero no para uso extremo."
5,Loved it!,"This is a great planner. I really looked through all of the planners carefully, and I was planning a fairly large wedding (125 people). This book had so many great checklists and it made me think of things I would not have thought of! It was easy to read.Don't be intimidated by the size of the book - there are some sections that you won't even use. (For example, if you're having a DJ instead of a band, you don't even look through the band section.) But it also has fill-in-the-blank worksheets so that you can ask vendors questions.Everyone said that our wedding was a blast and that it had obviously taken a lot of organizing. That last part is true - but I just could not have done it without a good reference such as this one. I also recommend Amy's little 'Bride Mini 411' book - it's the mini-version of this with the checklists. Amy Nebens - I would like to give you a hug!!"
5,I am just correcting the page on the Web,"I would like to get the book, which I have not read. The authors name is mis-spelled in the page It should read Karl Doenitz vs. Deonitz. The book is available in paperback reprint from Da Capo Press, 1997, New York, 520 pages.Robert Murphy"
2,A Musical Christmas From the Vatican,"The best performance on this dvd is Jewels Christmas version of ""hands"", the other songs are all pretty good but the camera angles and overall filming of the event is of poor quality. If you are buying this dvd for Jewels song you'd probably be better off getting her own Live dvd filmed at Humphreys at the bay."
4,"Again, the kids are possessed!","""David Collins and Amy Jennings, two charming, innocent children are suddenly turned into demons. At first their pranks only annoy Maggie Evans, their governess. But soon she realizes that they have become malicious, bent on destroying all at Collinwood. Convinced the children are possessed by a mysterious, supernatural power, and frightened for her life, Maggie turns for help to Barnabas Collins. Will his powers be strong enough to become the evil forces that captured the minds of the children before they - and Barnabas - are completely at the mercy of the Devil himself?"" (The plot synopsis is taken from the back cover of the first edition paperback. #11 in the series.)"
1,Don't be fooled,"Went to old glory.com to just compare for myself, these were listed $40 cheaper on the website.. Good thing I checked!"
5,loved it!,The Novel is a refreshing love story that gave an insightful glimpse into the psyche of both sexes.It was entertaining as it incorporated slang which spanned the 1980's through the 21st century
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I try to support new authors, but I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was poorly written and did not flow well at all. I am amazed that Madeleine Farrell was an English major. There were several grammatical errors. They should definitely invest in a better editor."
1,This movie was horrible,"I was so excited to see this movie because I was aware of the legend of ""La Llorona"", and it was a big disappointment. The acting was horrible, the movie is low budget, and it seemed more like a soft porn movie than a horror story. Don't waste your money or time with this one. Hopefully someone else will come along and remake it. It could be a great movie about a legend that has endured for centuries. This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched."
1,Watch KM 31 (kilometro 31) instead!!!,"If you are looking for a GREAT version of the ""La Llorona"" myth look for the Mexican 2007 production of ""KM 31"" (or Kilometro 31). It is reminiscent of the J Horor movies. An excellent script, creepy as hell, and great efx! You will not be disappointed!!! Having said that...The Wailer movie was so bad that I cant even intelligently review it. The acting was horrible, the script was horrible, the production was well...you guessed it horrible!! The only positive thing I can say is that the image of La Llorona in the last 19 seconds of the movie was pretty scary looking. But not worth the $5 dollars. Trust me...look for KM 31 instead....you will thank me!!!"
2,EXPECTED SOMETHING ELSE.,"i was getting ready to watch some straight up horror. judging by the cover, you'd figure you'd be curled up on some couch getting creeped the hell out, but no, not at all. on the real, the only good thing, and scary thing was the wailer. that lady was mad crazy looking. i wish there could have been a lot more of her, and a lot less of those actors. almost threw up on some parts. see these are some of the things uncalled for in these horror flicks. what, now to get people scared you have to get people naked. so not my style. anyway. they blew it big time. the beginning was good, then it just went downhill from there. until i saw her, that was good makeup work. her wailing kind of gave you chills. i got to give her some kind of credit. man, there could have been so much done with this movie, and this character. the ending was okay. i didn't see it coming. pretty good, shows that not all folklore is fake. don't mess with what you don't know."
1,B- Rated Tits and Ass Horror Movie w/ the worst possible acting,"I bought this movie to show to my AP Spanish Literature and Culture class. Knowing that ""La Llorona"" is pre-colombian, I thought there might have been a better story line as to her history and a good scare for my students around Halloween. It was a relief that 90% of my students were gone that day due to the Giants' world series parade because the film focused on shallow behavior with booty and booby shots throughout the majority of the film. I tossed the movie. Save yourself the money and don't waste your time watching this."
3,Not as bad.,"Well written script, and has good makeup for the creature/ghost. The acting is so-so, but The Wailer is an ok horror movie."
1,low budget and it shows!!!!,this is one of the worst movies I have ever saw!! I dont recommend it to anyone!! the movie was low budget and the acting wasnt good at all!!! Dont waste your time with this movie!!
5,Michel Thomas has a Winning Formula,"I ordered the eight C/D deluxe edition after reading about Thomas's courses in British Airways' flight magazine. So far the collection has exceeded my expectations. You learn by getting the language in your ear and building sentences immediately. Thomas does not waste any time. I studied Italian at university twenty years ago, so this pace was not a problem for me. If it's grammatical instruction you seek, look elsewhere. The course may be a little too accelerated for the true beginner, but for someone who wants to ""brush up"" and learn all the essential everyday vocabulary, it's perfect!"
4,Italian with Michel Thomas - Deluxe Language Course,"I enjoyed this course very much. It was very different from any other Italian self-study course I have completed for the following reasons - the CD course puts you right in the middle of a class between Michel and two of his students - and they make the same mistakes you would make (e.g, pronunciation). You really feel like you're taking a live course. Also what I liked is that Michel would ask the students to form a basic sentence (e.g., voglio farlo (I want to do it)). Then he'd say ""Ok, now say: I want to do it because I want to go there"", so the students would have to build on the original sentence and say: ""voglio farlo perche voglio andarci.""It's a great way to learn and very different from listening to language tapes or reading a grammar book.I highly recommend it for someone looking for a different learning experience."
2,Great for the first month,"I have been using this with my G5 for about a month now. Up 'til now I have loved it for CS:S. But now the speed side is getting worn and there is a lot of friction with it and the mouse skates. I held it up to a light and I can see that the top layer is wearing away. I wouldn't recommend this for a gamer that plays a lot, it will wear out after a month or two."
2,Wired Optical Only!,"Before buying it, know that this mousepad doesn't work with Laser mice. And that it will severely cripple the range of a Wireless mouse.Otherwise, the shape is cool and it feels solid."
3,Not as advertised,"I ordered two of these posters, and they are NOT the size they are advertised for. I emailed the vendor, but they haven't changed the dimensions, as I see here. These posters are NOT 16X20, but more 13X19 which is an odd size. There's nothing I can do with them. The prints are blurry and not very attractive. They look like they were printed on poster paper but not according to their resolution.The customer service was very kind and they offered to send alternative posters but their selection of Beatrix Potter 16X20 posters is so small, and so I didn't have much of a choice. The shipping charges are ridiculous too."
4,Nice Carrier,"We received this as a shower gift and it has really been nice. I definitely can't see spending big bucks for the Bjorn. This one is just as good. I used it quite a bit when our daughter was a newborn. She wanted to be close to me but I still had to get stuff done around the house too. It worked great because she wasn't very heavy. Now that she is 18 lbs. it gets a bit heavy, but she still seems to enjoy it. It is especially nice to use on days that are still a bit chilly but you want to go for a walk - baby is right there next to you keeping warm. The most important thing I have found is to make sure the straps are criss-crossing low enough on your back (as the manual states). If they are too high you will be uncomfortable."
2,Works better rear facing,"I bought this because I was too cheap to pay for the Bjorn and wasn't sure how much I'd use it. It worked great when my baby was 0 to 12 weeks old and we put him in it rear facing (his chest pressed towards us). Then around 3 months he wanted to ride front-facing where he could see, and as other reviewers have said, the front flap does *not* stay down! I tried to safety pin it but the pin came undone and the whole process became aggravating to my baby, so we don't use it anymore. I would think they would have tested this product with various age babies rear AND front facing before putting it on the market. I will buy a sling for my next baby and skip this product altogether."
4,Great for the price!,"I bought this product a couple of weeks ago and I like it alot. I use it often,The only thing is getting used to placing baby in the baby carrier. But the more I used it the easier it was to put baby in. Overall I think it's a great product at a great price."
3,Good Alternative if can't afford Baby Bjorn,"I have been through four different carriers and my daughter is only three months old. I just didn't want to spend big bucks for a Baby Bjorn. The hooks on the straps of the Infantino cut into my daughters face and was VERY difficult to unlatch and latch. I have pinched my fingers in the latches and broke many nails. The carrier also did not support my daughters head very well either. Also, when you turn your child around to face forward its very hard to latch and it doesn't fold completely down. It has good support on your back but not as good as the Baby Bjorn. I wished I would have not wasted so much time and gas and just bought the Baby Bjorn like everyone recommended. Now I finnaly have one and see what all the rave was about!! Its worth every penny!"
1,kills your back,"I got this carrier for my baby shower, I ended up using my aunts really really old fusha and royal blue tie died snugli one instead because it may have been ugly but it didn't break my back, don't waste your money, I would get a snugli brand carrier instead, my friend used one and she loved it. (oh one more thing, the whole time i carried my daughter around in this contraption people would ask me if she was ok cause it had no support for her and she looked like she was suffercating) ( however you spell it) I tossed this peice of junk out and Im going to get a better one when i have another baby."
2,Not so good.,"This carrier is not as good as I heard, read & thought it would be. It's hard for baby to get in and out of + not ideal for nursing mothers at all.Too many hard to manage buckles/straps.Sometimes it's worth paying a few more extra $$$ for a carrier that will do the job in the first place ."
4,This would be 5 stars if it wasn't discontinued by Fuji,"Great Contrast, Fine Grain instant Black and White Prints. Recoverable scanable and malleable Negatives are possible by the Popular Bleaching process. This BW film should Never have been discontinued, it is underappreciated as an instant film for landscape and instant art work!!! Very scan friendly, and displaying a gentle shoulder for exposure under a variety of light, a very friendly film to use.Pay attention to how you install the pack into the pack holder and pull only one page at a time,My pack makes it impossible to pull out all of the film at the same time, not sure how other users managed that. Take your time. BW exposure time 30-45 seconds, Color exposure time 1 Hr WTF!?Get it before it is gone! Adorama and B&H; have it for less than 10US per 10 exposure pack!"
5,Excellent film,"Fuji's FP series of peel-apart films are head-and-shoulders above their old Polaroid counterparts. Color, contrast, resolution, and ease of use are all better than I remember Polaroid being. Only complaint is that there is no negative with the FP films, but so long as the photos keep coming out razor-sharp and colorful, I'll get over it."
1,Took a picture and ALL of the film came out.,"I was so excited to get this film, but as soon as I took my first picture and tried to develop it all of the film came out. Not good for something that is that expensive.Other packs of film worked fine."
2,"Woefully lacking in 1649 info, the best of the best!","Nice book but it all suffers from a lack of closure, no pics or detail of 1649, the best of the best. No inside shots of 1649 and only one exterior - collapsed landing gear at Stockton Airport. How ignoble an edited ending for the most beautiful aircraft ever built, before or since. Kicker is that this is billed as Volume No. 1 with no indication of how to get Vol. 2. Maybe Vol. 2 vindicates Scott Germain. He should hope so!"
3,"Johnson 10, Producers 0","I second, and then some, every good thing said by other reviewers about Susan Johnson. She may be the best vocalist to ever perform on Broadway and this collection showcases the great range of her talent. If there were more than 5 stars I would give them to her. BUT, whoever produced this compilation should be ashamed. If you plan to buy it, be forewarned, first of all, that the majority of the songs were cut by the producers after one verse (e.g. ""I Can't Say No"" lasts 59 seconds). Secondly, they appear to have gathered ten or twelve people in a room and had them clap, half-heartedly, for a few seconds, and then tacked the same little smattering of applause onto the end of every song. I found that distracting, even downright annoying. She deserves better, much better. IF such things don't bother you, you will love this compilation. If they do, you are hereby warned."
4,I was rootin' for the bear!...,"A quirky tale of oddball characters and a rampaging bear, set against what must be some of the most spectacular scenery on the planet. Enough authentic Alaska local color, sizzling one-liners, and wry observations to keep even the casual reader turning the pages of this slim volume that you could easily knock off on your next flight to Kansas City. Though I liked the story and the Tlingit Indian info, I was hoping for a bit more sex and, quite frankly, was rooting for the bear who could well end up on a Green Party ballot someday. A wild romp sure to elicit a few chuckles and get you to planning a visit up to our northernmost state..."
3,Surprisingly decent,"This one was a staple of the horror sections in video stores back in the '80s and '90s, and one of the few of its type that I never saw -- the cover makes it look like Troma Z-Grade T&A;, which I usually avoid, but Netflix mailed it to me last year by mistake. Despite my utter annoyance, I didn't have anything better to do, so I watched it.The story is a routine rip from both HALLOWEEN (psycho escapes from asylum and starts killing teens) and ELM STREET (bizarre nightmares of the killer), but it's surprisingly well executed. There's some really good cinematography, some genuinely cool scare/dream sequences, and a complimentary musical score. Of course, there's some obligatory bad acting, a pointless montage that exists solely for gratuitous nudity purposes (""let's get naked and try on our best friend's clothes while she's not home!"") and some other typical '80s idiocy. But all in all for its genre, there's a whole lot worse out there."
2,Falls Short of Other 1980's Slasher Classics,"As a reviewer said before me, this movie certainly does take most of it's plot from that of ""Halloween"". A raving psychopath murdered his family 12 years ago with the exception of one of his sisters, Beth (or Laura as we later find out). Now 12 years later Beth has joined a sorority. The sorority house itself is actually Beth's old house and her moving in sets off her maniacal brother who then escapes from an asylum and hunts her down.Sounds like a good plot, and it really is. Where the movie fails to deliver is in the suspense catagorie. It fails to deliver any really scary scenes, nothing that will make you jump anyway. The killing scenes are average but nothing spectacular and the flashbacks at the beginning are a bit confusing although it all comes together at the end. If your a fan of the 80's slasher flicks you might want to check this out but I'd recommend ""Slumber Party Massacre"" instead. 2 1/2 stars."
3,just ok,"I bought this highlighter because the price is so good compared to other branded highlighters, and I thought highlighters are just highlighters and won't make too much of difference. However, the capping is so tight that it is pain to close/open every time. Also, the wedge of the tip is in a slightly weird angle that I noticed I have to make slight adjustment when I highlight. I will not buy this brand again and switch back to what I used before."
1,I WASTED MY $$$ ON THIS!,"I followed the directions on this product, however, after giving ample time for it to work w/o noticing results, I increased my intake to 4 tablets after every meal; totaling to about 8 per day. I still didn't have any noticeable results! I utterly wasted my time & $$$ on this product. I don't know what all the hype was or if they were just written by producers of this product to make sales, but, it did NOT work for me. I get better results if I just hold off for a few days (w/o taking this product) then releasing and get impressive results. I plan to try other alternatives on the market."
3,Have not noticed anything,"I haven't noticed too much of a difference in my climax. Perhaps this is something for older people rather than the younger folks. I gave it 3 stars because I have not been consistently using it, perhaps this will change when I start using it over a period of a month or two."
2,Too many political views,This book is more about the politics of future technology than the technologies themselves.. The author has his own politcal beliefs and he does not shy away from expressing them. His left leaning political beliefs make this book hard to read. Many of the facts seem to be repeated and he must have quotes from every science fiction book and movie that was ever produced. Ray Kurzweil's books were ten times better.
1,The new Manifesto,"I gave up reading this tripe after about 60 pages or so. Mr. Hughes may have actually had something valuable to say in this book, but it gets lost amongst all of the socialist (""liberal democratic"" and so on) propaganda. The book appears to boil down to ""If the government would just give everyone everything, it'd be all right."""
3,Maybe,"The CD was all right, there was only about six songs that i had reall liked. The skit with the homeless guy was very funny, tucan sam."
5,OHMSS - The Best Bond Score Ever,John Barry's OHMSS soundtrack is the best of the scores ever composed for a Bond film. It is Bond and beyond. It is indescribable.
4,Best of the Bonds,"Despite being over 30 years old this music has stood the test of time better than more recent Bond CDs. While the music is great, the album is not, due to the omission of some great cues, choppy splicing together of other ones (including the trim from the end of the Main Title- argh!), and could definitely benefit from an expanded re-release. Still, it's great stuff."
4,Gotta Love The Extra Tracks,"These are all the inbetween or filler tracks that are not ""main"" titles.Not unlike the Star Wars origional trilogy remasters with bonus tracks. All the music you hoped was on the disc the first time around. Those special moments that often just SCREAM volumes about the characters or plot. I had the album when the film was released and was bummed out when it wore out,(along with my turntable). Probably one of Barrie's best Bond scores in that it invokes the action, sensuality, and sense of wonder the earlier Bonds gave us. Plus Louie Armstrong's ""All The Time In The World"". Can it be better?"
4,Barry-varry varied.,"John Barry. He just is the master. At this time Barry were at his top as a Bond-writer. Together with ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""You Only Live Twice"" is this the best album of him. It's very varying and that's something good. He's action-songs are magnificent, just like in ""YOLT"". On this CD is it Track nr. 2 ""This Never Happened to the Other Feller"" and Track nr.10 ""Battle at Piz Gloria"" that is pure action-stuff. If you want a little more soft music, listen to Track nr. 3 ""Try"" (which I don't like) and Track nr. 9. ""Over and Out""(which is great). But Track nr. 3 (as I already been mention) and Track nr. 7. ""Journey to Blofeld's hideout"" is not particularly good. But the rest of the songs fill them up. The instrumental Main Theme is also a real great one. The three best songs: Track nr. 2: ""This Never Happened to the Other Feller"", track nr 6. ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and track nr. 10: ""Battle at Piz Gloria"". Enjoy!"
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE 007 SOUNDTRACKS,"This is one of the best soundtracks that John Barry has composed. Track 6 is a great action theme, and track 4 is a great chase theme until it mellows out and stops with the ski chase theme. Song 1 is very beautiful, and song 9 is a very interesting track. It's kind of calm and tense at the same time. Track 10 is a good fast paced track, and track 11 is sad until the last 50 seconds break into the James Bond theme. A very good buy, and definitely worth your money. This really shows how good John Barry is, and how good a 007 soundtrack can be. Two words: GET IT."
5,OHMSS soundtrack,"I have the LP for this soundtrack and haven't listened to it in years, but missed the music and finally broke down and bought the CD. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was still everything I remembered- great ""Bond"" music and a nice seasonal christmasy song you'll not hear anywhere else that I know of. So, regardless of your opinion of the Lazenby Bond, this is classic 007."
2,disapointing!!,"After going through all the previous eps. of beserk. i am very disapointed with the ending. it was nothing short of a hentaiesque finale. (""holy overfiend batman"") poor casca. anyway the series was a letdown, i was expecting a lot more especially since the dreamcast game (which they should have based the plot on, instead of some prequel) was so f*cking cool. one thing i hate about epidsodic anime i.e. evangelion,noir,gasaraki. is that it drags on and on. until the near ending when things suddenly start to pick up. it may be fun for most otakus, but to me it's a disturbing trend."
5,the best DVD ever,"If you like blood, this is for you. There's this splashing array of blood as the Behlit is summoned, and GOD HAND comes out and demons are everywhere, and the 4 Gods, demons, angels....whatever they happen to be, and everyone is getting killed, and there's these skulls. Oh yeah, and there's this snow episode, and it has the absolute best sword battle ever(before Gatts leaves), and it only last a few seconds, but it is awsome. Anyway this DVD is for babies, kids, and adults, a real must see for every one."
4,The end?,"Berserk was a good series the whole way through. It was not perfect but it is definately worth owning. I would highly recommend this for any mature audiences.As the series enters into the end of its last story arc, Griffith's fate draws near. He must make the ultimate sacrifice in order for one last chance to achieve his dreams. Guts, Caska, and the rest of the band of the hawk then must fight for there very right to exist.The only complaint I have is this series has absolutely no ending at all. The skull night was supposed to save Guts and CaskA from Griffith, yet the skull night's character was cut out of the series. So, rather then force an ending, they simply leave Guts and Caska being torn apart and raped by demons at Griffith's command. It was a poor choice of an ending."
5,Old Fashioned Romance Epic,"This action packed film has all the trademarks of a classic. Romance, exotic locales, fist fights, and a mean hombre as a villain. Orsen Welles would be proud."
4,INSANE!!!,Very cool indie movie. The fight and action scenes are great. The characters are bizzare. It is one of the best shot movies in Mexico I've ever seen. The soundtrack is awesome.
4,Helter Skelter,"Totally Insane! It's like Miami Vice on acid! Some undercover dude named Gideon goes on a killing spree on the streets of Mexico. He hooks up with a hot chick whose a drug traffiker and all hell breaks loose. The villain ""El Gallo"" is one sick [person]. The action sequences are some of the best I've seen in an indie flick. The dialogue is like Tarrantino and funny as hell. If you're looking for an action packed movie with some sick laughs then look no further. Not for the timid!"
2,a bunch of excate same footage as other sets i bought,"well i bought four different sets of the vietnam different series ,two sets name completely differnt were the same stuff ,i thought i was going boonkers ,watched the same stuff over and over ,so spent money wastefull"
1,Buyer beware of Madacy Entertainment,"Much of the footage is exactly the same as another setput out by Madacy Entertainment called ""We Were Heroes,Vietnam"" with a date of 2006. What crooks these peopleare. They release a 5 dvd set in 2005 called ""BattlegroundVietnam"", then a year later they trim it down to 3 dvdsand change the picture on the box and title it as ""We wereHeroes"". Do not buy anything from Madacy Entertainment.A much better set is called ""Vietnam War with Walter Cronkite""with 12 hours of viewing time instead of the 6 hours on theMadacy garbage."
1,$$,"Though what I've heard about the book is excellent, I am rather put off by the fact it is listed at $1,500. Very, very few books are worth that kind of money, and this is not one of them, as there exists more than one copy."
5,"Ready or not, here it is....","If you are comfortable in the belief that homo sapiens is the crown of creation, the top of the food chain, and the most highly-developed lifeform active in our solar system, this book is not for you. If you are content without a plausible answer as to why governments refuse to discuss UFOs, and prefer to think they reached that decision voluntarily, this book is not for you. If finding out that the truth is not way, way out there, but very, very close might keep you up nights, this book is not for you.Perhaps you could easily dismiss what Ingo Swann has to say about Earthside versus Spaceside intelligences. Maybe you could read part of this book and then go back, unperturbed, to your regular life. It didn't work out that way for me."
3,Not believable,"Short review: I personally believe in the very real possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence, moon bases, secret government groups, remote viewing etc. But there is far more credible evidence out there. I do not doubt that Ingo Swann is a achieved remote viewer, but I also heard him state once that he ""always wanted to write a best seller."" I think this book is his attempt. It reads completely like fiction to me, with too many unrealistic, convenient coincidences and bond-style quirks and personas to come off as credible. That's my first impression."
5,Take a second look at the moon.,"Ingo Swann, the man who coined the term ""Remote Viewing"" and gifted psychic that aided our government in developing its own psychic spy program, breaks the silence on extra terrestrials.A very well researched book that reveals the connection of extra terrestrials and the moon."
4,a decent watch that serves its purpose,i bought this watch when i starting running about 6 months ago. the watch was perfect. the buttons and functions are designed just right. the display is just the right size for seeing when on the run and the functions work easily even when i'm breathing heavy. i particularly like the ability to store lap times. 4 weeks ago the battery died in it and i took it in to have the battery changed. the watch didn't work properly after the battery change so i sent it into timex service. they sent me a new one. the service was great.
2,Ooops,"HEY! LOOK AT THAT WATCH! IT HAS A METAL BEZEL! IT MUST BE STRONG!Of course it is, look at that metal bezel. Just look at it. It can absorb any shock without much damage at all, transferring it all to the....the glass/plastic screen.I dropped mine on the ground. it was cement. The metal bezel was yelling in rage of how strong it was and transfered all the shock to the screen, cracking it a bit. waterproofness=totally compromised.I had to take the watch apart occasionally to bleed out the moisture and try to fix the screen. Oh well. It's still cool looking.GUESS WHAT ELSE!LOOK AT THAT RUBBER BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE! IT'S SO SQUISHYuntil it deteriorates and flakes off. Leaving a nub of a plastic button for you to press, outlined with the rubber shavings of the dead rubber coating.Also, You're out of luck if the watch band breaks.This watch looooooks so cool though. Just buy it and use it as a wall clock."
1,Watch if fine; watchband awful,"As with everyone else who gave this product a 1-star review, I have been looking for a replacement band for this watch and have now discovered you can't replace it. That's insane. I now have a useless hunk of plastic and metal. So my replacement watch will NOT be a Timex. They have permanently lost a customer."
3,Fascinating Psychological Thriller,I love asian films with female lead roles and this was one of them. I got more into the film when the main character Jiney started showing odd behavior which I found very interesting.
2,Poor asian horror,This movie was not one of the best asian horror movies ive seen alot better.This movie stars out slow then takes a twist by the ending it was a big disappointment.I watch a lot of asian horror and gore but this one i dont thank ill bother to watch again.Could have had a better ending.
4,"Graphic, novel","If you're looking for another Pang Brothers horror movie like The Eye, this isn't it. No ghosts, no creepy supernatural events.Jiney is a photography student dissatisfied with her life; it's only after she takes a photo of a dying woman that she comes alive. Her best friend Jas is worried about her obsession with death, and tries to help her through it. But just when Jiney thinks she has a handle on things, she's stalked by someone who knows her secrets.Most of the movie was well done: it's graphic and edgy, but you can really understand why Jiney is the way she is. The end--with the final confrontation and revelation of the stalker's identity--is both weak and unnecessarily squirm-inducing, however. I found out after watching the movie that Jas (Rosanne Wong) and Jin (Race Wong) are sisters in real life, which makes the scenes of Jas taking care of Jin rather poignant."
1,It sucks,and that's pretty much all I have to say about that.It reminds me a lot of Cinderella (the Japanese Horror movie) except it lacks everything that made that movie great and worth watching.I admit I didn't finish watching this film it lost my interest and just seemed to bland. There's lots of other good Asian horror films out there but this one doesn't really stand out amongst them.
4,"A bit confusing, with numerous storylines","The title pretty much sums it up, but the reason that I rated it so high was that despite these things, it still managed to be a pretty good movie. The main character was emotionally complicated and dangerous, making numerous bids to regain control of her life, slowly losing her sanity, and after this is resolved, the movie is only half over."
4,A surprisingly refreshing horror film,"I'm a huge fan of Asian cinema, especially horror. When this film came in the mail the other week, I put it off until tonight, I got it for 5 dollars and I didn't expect much considering most films try to emulate what has already been done so many times before. This film however is extremely fresh and well worth watching. It kind of reminded me of an Argento film, back when Dario was making good films, only with Asians instead of Italians. I realize that isn't the best comparison but the cinematography (watching this in a bluray player upscaled to 1080p is phenomenal) was outstanding and the twist at the end was nicely done and both reminded me of Argento films.Overall, definitely check this film out if you enjoy Asian cinema and good thrillers."
3,No Lyrics for Rack 'EM UP,"I bought this album after hearing the title song ""Rack 'Em Up"" performed with the lyrics, which I loved. I was very disappointed that the version on this album is only instrumental. Who'd a thought the album by the same title wouldn't have the lyrics? Does anyone know what album has them? I can't find the song on his other albums."
3,Anson Funderburgh,"A girl I once dated who first saw Anson at the King Biscuit Blues festival in Helena Arkansas used the words ""Master of the Stratocaster"" to describe Anson Funderburgh. I of course thought, ""Come on, Master, what about Eric C. and SRV"", but once I saw him play, I knew what she was talking about. He really combines the 50's sound with a classic blues sound. And he is only half of it. Lead singer Sam Myers is a huge black guy with Coke bottle lenses for glasses. He looks like he is in his 80's and moves real slow, but it all makes a good show. When Sam puts an old fashioned microphone up to his mouth with his harmonica, he defines the word feel when it comes to blowing the harp. I myself am a Bass Player, and pull this CD out everytime I need to pracice my up-right Double Bass. I know I am in for a good work. It is a great CD to play at parties too. Everyone always wants to know who it is. I highly recomend this CD."
5,This is a CLASSIC album....,"I don't ever write reviews cause everyone should be allowed to have their own opinion, however this dude can't be serious. How can you hate on KING TEE's DEBUT ALBUM?!! This album is a CLASSIC front to back. Beats, lyrics are, will always be, great. Respect the legend, King Tee!"
3,I got this for free--so should you,"This album is mad dated, but that's half the appeal. DJ Pooh produced, doing his classic Paul C/Ced Gee impersonation (kind of poorly). Yeah, and don't be alarmed if you hear long, awkward stretches of no beat. It seems like when they were mixing it down, somebody forgot to turn the volume up on one of the tracks--every time. Anyway, the rhyming is funny at times, NWA-imitating at times, and not tremendously exciting at all.When you add up my brilliant analysis, you don't get ""worth sixty bucks."" If I had sixty bucks, I'd spend it on a hair brush. I got my copy (via MP3) for free from a message board. King Tee and his gangsta friends would suggest you do the same. Wiz-urd."
4,"good value, would buy again","The seal is plenty grippy, the envelope and seams seem strong enough and the privacy feature works. Good enough for my uses anyway."
5,Great for wall collage,I used a portion of this set for a wedding photo collage in my home. Great variety of sizes and easy to hang. Black painted finish is simple and elegant - no visible defects.
3,The Alamo Documentary,"I thought the film was informative. During the early part of the film there was a lot of history, interesting observations from both sides of the war. But I was bored to tears when they began the Davey Crockett memorabilia segment. But if you are a Texas history buff, it is worth spending the time watching. I particularly enjoyed the black and white segments that were add ins. Quite humorus."
3,"If you must watch a film about the Alamo, watch this one","Richard Reyes Flores is a very smart man with an insightful take on how ""the Alamo"" became such a huge deal, and so destructive to real live human beings. This documentary, however, doesn't do Flores' profound analysis justice. Better to read _Remembering the Alamo: Memory, modernity and the mastery symbol_(2002), his edited volume of Adina de Zavala's writings, his book about _los Pastores_, or one of his articles (Google Scholar will help you out there)....Relative to other Alamo productions (yuck), this film is excellent, but in itself, just okay."
2,Remember the Alamo - forget this DVD,"The main problem with this 75-minute documentary is it does not give a sense of the historical ""big picture"".It starts off with historians and museum curators telling us what was wrong with all the movies made about the Alamo and the depiction of the characters in them, then wanders around the subject of the battle itself. However, it fails to present a decent time-line of history, and leaves you wondering what all the fuss was about.Extras include the 40-minute 1937 movie called ""Remember the Alamo"", which at least gives a little historical perspective on the subject. Also is a 5-minute piece about weapons and uniforms described by an unusually dressed (in real life) man from the main documentary. Finally there is a trailer from John Wayne's 1960 version of ""The Alamo"".There must be better presentations of the subject, though the inexpensive price makes this DVD not a total waste as a second source of information."
1,"So Boring, it took four tries to see it to the end.","I was hoping for history of the Alamo, what I got was first, a history of Alamo movies, second, history the fifties Davy Crockett fad, third, a guide tour of Alamo tourist memorabilia, fourth, reenactors giving misinformation in the form of historical opinion, and finally, about who is allowed to be a member of the Daughter of the Texas Republic organization.If you want history don't waste your money on this DVD."
2,Navel-gazing documentary,"The Bottom Line:The Alamo Documentary, despite the definitive nature of the title, does not tell any sort of history of the battle, instead talking with some success (with very limited resources and almost no film clips) about the films which have been made about the battle and then regrettably switching into a self-congratulatory and indulgent hagiography of the ""San Antonio Living History"" society, which makes for exceptionally dull filmmaking; if you are interested in the Alamo itself, stay away from this bore.2/4"
5,Good documentary,"The war in Texas of 1835-36 is a very large subject, far larger than the American public probably realizes. No one documentary can be expected to provide more than a very brief introduction. There is a long interview with historian Stephen L. Hardin, author of ""Texian Iliad,"" the best summary history of the conflict.For some historical subjects, there is an interesting history of the history. The Alamo forms one such subject, and that history of the history is not overlooked here. For example, there is a segment on the phenomenal Davy Crockett craze of the 1950s. There is some discussion of the many movies, which form a large subject in itself."
4,"Sex, lies and really tall hats","Sex, sin, greed, a bit of the 'ol ultra-violence, and that's just before 1400! Read The Bad Popes and learn of historical figures such as Marozia and her sister Theodora, the Roman women whom Pope Joan is most likely based upon (created as political satire). In the opening chapters of The Bad Popes Russel Chamberlin traces similarities to the Joan story and the real life Theophylact ladies, it is a deliciously scandalous story. Case in point: their rivals invented the lovely term ""Pornocracy"", a political system dominated by prostitutes (it was fashionable at that time, as it often is in ours, to label powerful women with such epithets). I love these nasty little tales, they remind me how tumultuous and earthy historical study can be."
4,Made for a great reunion.,"It took the Doobies about a decade to shake off the stigma of Michael McDonald. With ""Cycles"" they came back with the kind of rock sound that long time fans had been yearning for. The singles, ""The Doctor"" and ""South of the Border"" are great and there are several other tracks which make you feel like the boys had never been away, just taking a long break. A worthy addition to any Doobies collection."
3,Tried a little too hard to sound old,"No one was more pleased than I when the Doobies reunited with members of the original band in place. It was reassuring with a sense of nostalgia having Tom Johnston in his rightful place in the lead. However with ""Cycles"" they seem to try a little too hard to sound like the Doobies of old instead of letting it come naturally sometimes playing chords that sound a bit too familiar. ""The Doctor"" the headline track is a good example of this and sounds like one half ""Sweet Maxine"" and one half ""China Grove."" The rest of the album fares a little better. Perhaps a little more thought could have gone into this album instead of trying to pick up where ""Stampede"" left off. Nonetheless it is great having them back!"
3,"Call ""the Docter""","The Doobie Brothers had seen their time go by in the 1970's. By 1989 they had very little to give, but one song on this album stands out as one of the best all out rockers of 1989!! The song is ""The Docter!"" ""Music is the Docter, makes you feel like you want too."" No truer words have ever been spoke."
1,Is this a bootleg CD?,"Been looking for this particular album (in CD) for awhile and was delighted that there was one available. When I received it, I noticed that the cellophane packaging was different than what I expected. Then when I put it into my computer to play it on Windows Media Player, the titles, both disc and song titles, were in Chinese (I am assuming it is Chinese since I cannot read it). I've heard about bootleg CDs coming from the oriental part of Asia and believe this is one of them."
1,Beyond the Pale,"This is unarguably the worst film I have ever seen. I regret any of the time I spend watching it. The script is awkardly written, the voices of the characters nearly indistinguishable from each other and the plot slow, searingly boring and not credible at all. While I hate to criticize the cast, knowing how hard actors work, i would assume the appallingly bad acting is a product of even more appallingly bad directing.Bad, bad, BAD film. Nobody involved should quit their day job."
1,80 minuits of your life you can never get back,"Pass this one by. Bad acting, bad writing,just bad overall."
2,"UUuummm, what can I say","This is a very low budget movie, the crying in this movie is sooooo fake !!, I personaly didn't like the movie and the acting was so bad."
2,"Made it to the end, just . . .",OK film but in retrospect if I'd previewed it first I wouldn't spend money on it. The story line had so much potential which has gone unrealised.
4,Goof Fun!,"This book is a newer version of the one I had someone in Glasgow send me years ago. I bought it for my Uncle's birthday as he was born there. I thought I'd get him his own. It's got a lot of newer terminology for the Glaswegian langauge/slang that I have heard about for years. While it does contain some of the old school terms, it's mostly new-speak. Good fun to read, but it would be really good to have a lot of the older stuff there that I have been using my whole life on my friends and colleagues. I could actually point to a reputable reference to show them what it means!"
4,Great Mixer... Yet not Pro.,"I'm not a pro user of mixers, i loved the unit, so practical and easy allowing a oneself to use all his music library neatly and listed in front of him, no cd's flipping whatsoever...Yet the only missing thing is the pitch control that allows controlling the beat, i doubt that this is doable without recordings on another separate drives..."
2,...no pitch control??!!,"....this can't really be called a mixer without a pitch control to slow down and speed up the music! Numark is a great company to buy mixer, I have a nice CD mixer by them. I would love a ipod mixing dock but this isn't a mixer if it doesn't have pitch control! There are stores selling this item on clearance right now for half its price!!I wonder why? ...still waiting for an ipod mixer in Milford"
5,Great DJ Equipment Starter,"I'm a DJ in the Houston area, and have been using this equipment for aboout 2 years now, and it has never given me any problems!! I tried to work with many mixers, but none of them are well designed as this one! It has (2) iPod decks (that charge the iPod)with its dedicated controls, so you don't have to ever touch the iPod, Low-Med-High and Gain controls, Master control, Mic input, Headphone input, a nice Fader, and has a Master output with a Record output. Plus (2) line/phono inputs, (2) ground inputs (turn tables),(2) USB inputs, a video input and a lot more! I can hook-up my entire speaker system! Which include (2) 15"" power speakers, and (2) 15"" power subs!The CONS about this equipment is that, it doesn't pitch blend, or has special effects, and you also cannot scratch. If you are looking to pitch blend, scratch, etc., you can always purchase (2) CD players and hook them up to this mixer, no problem!"
4,if you like black metal then you probably own this already,"but for those of you who don't yet own a copy this should become a very sought after release. My only experience with Thorns previously had been the split with Emperor as I had never heard the demo tapes from the early 90s. Regardless of past knowledge of the band this album is very polished and clean with a strong production of all the instruments and the guitar in particular having that classic black metal sound (that Thorns in part helped to create) with the treble knob turned fully clockwise it would seem. As a previous reviewer stated there are touches of industrial throughout this album, nothing as severe as Dodheimsgard did with 666 International but its present all the same helping to give the album a highly mechanical feel. This album might even appeal to people not normally interested in black metal for while it IS black metal, there is no arguement over that, it contains enough originality and strong songs to merit attention."
5,Facinating Album,"I bought the Thorns vs. Emperor split album a couple of years ago. Gave it a few listens, thought the Thorns tracks were good, and basically shelved it. Recently, those Thorns tracks really grew on me to the point where I decided to explore self-titled full length album. I now wonder why I've waited so long to experience this one, as it is absolutely compelling from start to finish. Stand out tracks for me were Existence (probably the fastest in tempo), World Playground Deceit, Shifting Channels, Underneath the Universe pt.2 and Vortex. Looking forward to the forthcoming album from Thorns!"
2,One of the oddest books I've ever read....,"Because I'm a huge Ahlberg fan, I hate to say this, but what was he thinking with this one? It's so odd that it's fun to read because the kids laugh. I mean really, ""One day Bert has an adventure with a shirt...."" and then something about how he can't get it over his head, falls down a flight of stairs and ""winds up in Scotland."" It gets confusing there, because then he has ""an adventure with a sausage"".! NONE of this book makes any sense, there's no story really, its just odd things happening to an odd person named Bert. But hey, It's not like we don't; read it! And thats the point. Oh and also, in the beginning of the book Bert has a baby (Baby Bert) that you're supposed to not wake up when you turn the page. Strange book!"
5,nice board,This board has really held up good. I am 185 pounds and pushing the weight limit for this size. It held me in the wave well and didnt wash out that often. Top of board is contoured comfortably and not extreme. Really pleased so far.
5,Always With Me!,I am new at birdwatching & this is a great guide for someone who wants a guide specifically for NY so you don't have to sift through pages & pages of North American birds to find what you're looking for. The fact that it is organized by the color of the bird makes it so easy for the novice & I am never out & about without it.
5,Quite helpful,"I picked up this book along with several others to help me to evaluate how my daughter is doing in school (and to help her improve). This book has proved to be quite helpful. It has helped me to understand why she says and does certain things, and to help me to understand who a first grader really is. I would recommend this book."
5,Excellent! Bends down laughing! * rolls,"If you love irreverent and witty religious/social humor this is the comic book for you! In modern times the biggest biz is religion... and guess who's the biggest CEO of the biggest multinational in the world??? God!!! Of course there are plenty of biblical character and more debauchery, hypocrisy and humor. You need this book! Funny, witty and gritty. Thumbs up writers and illustrations are superb."
5,I REALLY loved this book...,"Terracotta Summer is a wonderful story with real life characters learning about love in it's many different forms. I also loved how this book taught that through adversity we learn and grow. This book is set in the sixties in England, Scotland and Ireland. It was interesting to learn about the LDS Labor Missionaries, which I hadn't ever heard of before. Their work was difficult but necessary. I don't want give away too much of the story so, all I can really say is read it, you will be very glad you did."
1,Don't waste your money,I am an avid wrestling fan and this is the worst video I have ever seen. I gave it one star because that was the lowest available. This is not a video of the GLOW of the 80's which everyone loved. This was a waste of my money.
1,this video reminds me of hulkamania,"this show should have never been made. all it has in it is fat ladies from different countries, or they dont know how to speak english. and the refs in it are a bunch of wusses."
5,A First Year Teacher's Miracle!,"Three hours ago I received the book, ""I Teach Kindergarten"" and I just finished reading it cover to cover. The minute I opened the book I could not put it down. I just graduated from college and have accepted a position as a kindergarten teacher. Before reading this book I was overwhelmed with all that I needed to figure out and do before the beginning of the school year. After reading this book, I have several good ideas and my brain is in kindergarten mode. I am so excited about this position, and this book has given me several great ideas which I will incorporate in my classroom. All first year kindergarten teachers HAVE to have this book. I know I will use it for many years to come."
1,disappointing,This book contained ideas and teaching methods that have been outdated for at least 10 years. This book did not help me with ideas to start a new year and how to do lesson plans with quality content.
3,Some good ideas but OVERPRICED!,"For $60 I expected to receive a pretty thick and large book but I read the entire thing in about 3 hours. It is written very clear, is very organized, and there are some great ideas but again, not worth $60. On the back of the book the price states $19.95. I would expect a resale price of around $30-$40 max, but NOT over $60. Sad"
4,S I F T I N G,"The only thing that made this less than perfect was there was no actual music, just interviews, which were indeed informative. Seems to go hand in hand with new book out on the market titled, ""220: S I F T I N GThe Alien Battle RoyaleorHow we met the Spirit of Kurt Cobain.""Dig the postcards and poster extras."
3,"Good, but easy","Great book, but this book is not suitable for people ages 13 and up. Many of the words, I already know. There are some that I don't know, and it does have great pictures to help you remember words."
3,Elementary is a matter of opinion,"The so-called ""elementary"" edition of Vocabulary Cartoons is not elementary enough. ""Ductile"", ""succor"", and ""capacious"" are words whose meanings are more advanced than I was hoping for. I was also disappointed in the structure. I assumed from the title and from the cover information that words would be introduced through comic strip stories. Instead, the book is just a series of word-picture associations with no real story or funny taglines. It's probably a good book for junior high or high school students, but is above the elementary level."
3,"Contains ""You Can't Do That"" (5 stars) & some weak Motown covers (2 stars)","""You Can't Do That"" is the Fab Four's strongest hard-edged R&B-style; original ever. There's a raw 12-bar blues verse, melodic bridge w/minor chords, nasty-ass lead guitar riff locked tight with driving rhythm strum, persuasive John vocal, urgent backup harmonies, powerhouse funky groove propelled by Macca's relentless 1-note bass line + Ringo's 4/4 cowbell. Not to forget a totally filthy George guitar solo, some syncopated drum kicks exactly where they belong, all wrapped in a swirl of shimmering echo-ey cymbals courtesy of Dave Dexter Jr's engineers in Hollywoood...a very very complete record.Regarding the Motown covers: the Beatles approached the Hitsville liturgy much the same as did hundreds of other bar bands during those years: awestruck and clueless."
3,This is the Russian 2-album combo CD,"The Amazon write-up is confusing. This purportedly Russian-release CD sold by jammin_recordings has all the songs from 2 albums, ""Beatles Second Album"" AND ""Something New"" as well as some low-grade bonus tracks (33 total tracks). HOWEVER, the songs are NOT the Capitol (USA) versions but the UK versions. I have been searching for Capitol's versions on CD but didn't want the $170 box set, which gives you both stereo and mono versions of each song (for what purpose?). Capitol added some echo to many of the songs as well as an occasional embellishment (extra guitar chord in the intro to ""Any Time At All"" and harmonica at the end of ""Thank You Girl"") and these were the versions I remember so well. My vinyl versions aren't worth salvaging and I still hope to find some USA-version CD's."
2,"Good, but misplaces the heat retention theory.","This book is scientifically applicable, but lacks certain validity concerning heat retention, and other various forms heat transfer. I would reccomend this book to anybody who is interested in thermodynamics, but a profound interest it must be, because for most, it may seem a little dry. I give it 2 stars, but I would have given it higher if it's theories had been more precise. Mr. Siegel obviously knows his thermodynamics , though, and it is a rather intriguing book, once you get into the more exciting thermal theories. A good book, all in all, and I hope Mr.Siegel authors other books that I may be able to obtain."
2,disappointed,I was disappointed because there was only 1 song on it. And only lasted about 10-15 minutes. My fault for not investigating it good enough before I bought it. I feel I wasted my money.
4,Hallelujah,"Handel's Last Chance is an enjoyable DVD for elementary students. I recommend the product. It's a good supplement for teaching about Handel, but I would like to see less fiction."
4,"Very good, for a biography","Biographies of complex, contemplative people tend to have a problem: the author of the biography isn't nearly as contemplative as the subject. And, the author is frequently an expert in a different space. I think that this biography suffers from the same problem with respect to evaluating Kissinger's positions in certain cases. This is especially tricky in making an ""unbiased"" biography. Given the span of opinions about Kissinger, the main question is: was he a bad guy or not? And, if so, how bad? Here, it seems, that the author has failed to understand Kissinger's self-defense (as made in his memoirs). The upshot of this is that some of the psychological evaluations that any biographer must attempt seem quite at odds with the nature of the complexity that seems apparent in other sources on the man. All things considered though, this is an excellent work that shows how to relate different parts of a very complex and important figure."
4,Fair and balanced,"This is a well-written look at the career of one of America's most accomplished (though perenially controversial) diplomats. Mr. Isaacson studies his subject carefully, in numerous foreign policy crises around the globe. Moreover, he digs deeply into Dr. Kissinger's formative years to enable the reader to understand Kissinger's world-view, which is most decidedly non-American (consider Kissinger's deep admiration for such conservative European diplomats as Prince Klemens von Metternich and Otto von Bismarck). Mr. Isaacson is by no means a Kissinger partisan, but then again, he is not among the anti-Kissinger crowd either. What I found especially complex was Dr. Kissinger's relationship with President Nixon: the 2 men deeply distrusted each other, but they had a similar diplomatic vision, and were capable of coming up with bold initiatives."
2,Poor quality,"This was not a well-done reproduction of original album. As a matter of fact, neither was the original album. Save your money!"
2,Review of Seloc Marine Manual,This book is not worth the purchase price. It does not cover the steps in enough detail for the average person to complete the repairs. It shows Fig. (photos) that are confusing at best. I have used many repair manuals before and this rates at the bottom. I will not buy Seloc again.
4,better than nothing,"This manual covers so many engine, boat and stern drive combinations you have to be careful and read it twice. for the price and a little mechanical knowledge it paid for itself many time over."
2,Not specific to your engine,This book is a general guide for about 10 variations of engine. Not specific enough for what I need and should go into more detail on certain items and procedures
3,necessary to have,"It is all I need to do routine maintenance, which the owners guide that mercury puts out is not, does not even show where the fuel filter is. The wiring diagrams are particularly necessary, but only black and white, color would have been welcome"
2,Vague.,"I like the idea that this manual costs about a fifth of what a Mercruiser manual goes for, but I have found it too vague to be of much use. As another reviewer had commented, I had purchased the manual to help me winterize my boat and it was virtually useless in offering any specific information on where to find the coolant plugs or the process itself."
3,"3.5 stars, another good book by Guhrke","From the reviews I had read, I was afraid that I was going to dislike the heroine. I am very fussy when it comes to the female lead, and I sometimes am inclined to be swayed by bad reviews. But since I've liked most of Guhrke's books that I've read, I gave it a go...And I really liked the heroine. I was afraid she was going to be too much for my liking, but she wasn't at all. She was rebellious, but I symphatized with her when she felt unlikeable, especially to the hero, due to her past misdeeds. Vulnerability is the key authors to keep it relatable!Loved the pairing of the stuffy Englishman Sir Ian Moore with the volatile Italian Lucia.The story however didn't pick up for me until the last third of the book. It actually made me cry a couple of times towards the end. So overall, it was a wonderful read, typical of Guhrke's works for me."
4,A Good Romance,"I read this book several months after ""His Every Kiss"", a novel I was disappointed in. However I was immediately intrigued when I recognized several outlying characters-really enjoyed the Duke of Tremore and his story. I enjoyed this book, because it did have a different take than most. I liked stuffy Ian, loved to read of him loosing control. Lucia was interesting, and albeit gorgeous, had flaws. Please don't give me a perfect character such as Grace from ""Kiss"" and expect me to care what happens to her.This book was a keeper for me."
3,She's no princess but he is difinately a PRINCE...,"I read, I swooned, and I melted underneath the internal ardor of Ian's icy glare. Ian is human and flawed - and incredibly passionate beneath his contrived aloofness and indifference. He struggles with duty, honor and himself. Here is a guy who has integrity and an abundance of passion and love, only to be fallen by a thoughtless, reckless, spoiled brat who has to always get her way. I guess that is what one would expect from a juvenial, selfish hellion who risks the well-being and reputation of everyone around her for her ""freedom"". Always like royalty and the upper echelon of society to think they are above propriety. I would have given Ian 6 stars - he is such an incredible character. I am a sucker for the aloof, stickler and brooding type who is secretly vulnerable and too passionate for his own good (think Pride and Prejudice?). Get this book its a nice and pleasant read."
2,Somewhat tedious,"A spinoff of His Every Kiss, which was a very good read, and possibly one of my favorite historicals, She's No Princess almost seemed as if it had been written by someone other than Laura Lee Guhrke. While Dylan and Grace's story was unputdownable, I had trouble finishing Ian and Lucia's. I agree with the reviewer who said Lucia was a bit of a whiner and I never understood why Ian found her so attractive. The development of their relationship was never really elaborated on and by the end of the book I wasn't sure how the two of them had fallen in love with each other. While His Every Kiss was kind of a deep, heartfelt story, this one didn't compare. I found most of it to be monotonous and boring and not written with the cleverness that I had expected after reading His Every Kiss and Secret Desires of a Gentleman. However, I have faith that her other books that I bought will be much better."
4,She out of control - and it so much fun to watch....,"She's No Princess by Laura Lee Guhrke is electric historical novel of illegitimate daughter to the Prince of Bolgheri and the English Ambassador who was ordered to find the wayward daughter a husband before the London Season was over. Great Dialogue and sweet romance. This was first novel I read by Gukrke but it won't be my last. If you enjoy this genre, I would also suggest The Naked Duke by Sally Mackenzie , The Bride's Necklace by Kat Martin, One Little Sin by Liz Carlyle, The Lady Lies by Samantha Saxon."
2,Irritating Lucia!,"Thats what I would call this book but then I guess no one would buy it. Lucia was a annoying, irritating, conceited, spoiled brat. She manipulates Ian throughout the whole book to get what she wants. She flirts, uses her looks (and she's not the least bit ashamed of it) to get what she wants. She was not worthy in the least of Sir Ian. Poor man! He is the only reason I kept reading this book, and being able to read about Grace and Dylan. Lucia has no redeaming qualities and she seems to only get worse throughout the whole story till the end when she realizes that maybe she has not been completely fair to Ian.Her last two books this and The Mariage Bed have been poor books for me but if your looking for a good one by this authortry ""Guilty Pleasures"" - great book, great characters, great passion."
4,THE ROYAL PAIN AND THE PROPER DIPLOMAT !!!!!!!!!,"She is trouble with a capital ""T"" and he is just too diplomatic for words.I just loved this book. It kept me reading for hours and I didn't want to put it down. An Italian beauty and a handsome Englishman make this one terrific read. He THINKS he has the upper hand in this relationship, but this story is a battle of wills. The book is funny and the characters are just made for each other. You will truly enjoy this book."
3,If you want to waste some cash...,"""Descendents of Darkness"" is an okay series. That means that everything in this series is just okay. The animation, the plot, the voice-overs....everything. The box set presentation is also somewhat misleading. There are really only four episodes that are divided into three episodes each. There is some continuation but none of the characters are really fleshed out well. Tzsuki,the main character, never really gets a proper backstory and neither does the main villian. This is pretty upseting if that for the simply fact than is the last episode their histoary is supposed to play a major role. I recommend this series for people who have already gotten into anime since this is not the best series to start off with. I do heed a small warning though, there is male slash within the series. The villian rapesa young boy and Tzsuki has a deep ""connection"" with his partner."
3,"Well, it's okay...","I had read up quite a bit on Yami no Matsuei (Descendants of Darkness) before I saw this series. I was pretty psyched about it when I started watching it and I instantly fell in love with Tsuzuki. However, this series ultimately proved too dark and violent for my liking so I stopped watching it mid-series. If you're into constant bloodshed and really odd plot twists (as in ""Wow, I didn't see that coming"" and also, ""?!... That was weird..."") then I would suggest giving this a try. Certainly not for the faint of heart."
3,Death to the NA!!,"Yami no Matsuei is possibly one of the top five anime I've seen, perhaps even up there with Evangelion. However, after viewing a few of the NA version episodes purchased by a friend, I would have to suggest importing the pure, unadulterated, un-Americanized version straight from Japan. There is just so much... editing, and cutting... :: shudders :: The ignorance of our culture... upsetting really."
1,"Interesting title, interesting content","The book provided interesting information about the history of encyclopedia. However, the title of the book is ""A history of information storage and retrieval"", not the history of encyclopedia. The author seems to have assumed the encyclopedias as the only way of storing information.I did learn some interesting things from the book; yet, not much about what I was aiming to look for ""information storage"" and ""information retrieval""."
1,Misplaced title,"In computer science as well as in library and information science there is a field devoted to information storage and retrieval. It has even got its own journals, e.g. ""Information retrieval"". Another journal, ""Information Processing & Management"" was formerly titled ""Information Storage and Retrieval"".This research area has an experimental tradition going back to the 1950'ties including the famous Cranfield experiments, and is today continued in the TREC experiments.This book mentions absolutely NOTHING of all this research. It is mainly concentrating on the history of encyclopedias. The author or publisher may have chosen this misguiding title because they have already earlier published a book about encyclopedias."
5,LUCK HAS ARRIVED!,"I have been waiting patiently for this follow-up to the debut album, as my memory reminded me how much better the songwriting had been than ""Fools Gold,"" a great record in its own right. I may be 47, but my memory still serves me well. After putting it on and cranking it up, a big smile came across my face, for two reasons. One, the songs still hold up (even though my wife calls it impossibly retro), and the re-mastering is done much better than the first, with the bass now a more punched up member of the mix. From ""Sweet Country Air"" to ""Gypsy Brew"" to ""Captain,"" anybody who enjoys the country rock genre would highly enjoy this record. I stick by the 5 stars, but if I had a complaint, it would be the over-production of a few numbers, but better that than under produced. Just having David Foster on keyboards insures a certain amount of polish to the overall sound. All in all, a very satisfying album, one that will get played as much today as it was 25 years ago!!"
4,Listen to the 'White Noise',"Starts off being funny in absurd and macabre ways with blended family, a Professor of Hitler studies and a would be Professor of Elvis and slowly transforms itself into a Kafkaesque nightmare. Much easier to read than his later novels and well worth the effort."
3,Good but not exceptionally original,"Delilo's White Noise is an existentialist tale about people's relationships with the media, technology, mortality and each other. It's a well written book that has some creative scenes (those in the grocery store) and characters (Murray, Wilder)that give the book depth. Delilo uses these strengths to explore his main themes.However, I didn't think his ideas were very original, and so I only gave his book 3 stars.Mankind's love/hate with technology was captured in Frankenstein, so it's nothing new here. The absurdist's dilemma of how to live in a godless world goes back to Camus and Dostoievski. So, while Delilo creates a novel with depth, he doesn't create a novel novel.I think that reading the authors above would be a better way to spend your time."
1,Pretentiousness Run Amok,Read this on an empty stomach or its unabashed pretentiousness will make you throw up.
3,"Bland at first, but better as the book progressed.","I had to read this book for my college English class. The first part of the book I found rather boring. To much detail with no plot, it was hard to get into the book. But as the book progressed the plot started to develop. The second and third parts were better. The book was very analytical which made it interesting. I would recommend this book if you are looking for a different style of writing, but not for entertainment."
2,I don't know about this one.,"I have no idea how everybody's receiving this one so well. I mean, Hitler Studies? I'm supposed to take this seriously? If I wasn't supposed to take it seriously on some level maybe I'd like it, but everybody wants me to take this book real seriously and I can't do it. The repetition of product names (like Velamints) is silly and adds nothing. And DeLillo doesn't bother to throw in a plot until two-thirds of the way through. I like the bantering between Heinrich and Babette and their kids but aside from that I'm not seeing the High Importance of this book. This book is like a still-life of watching television passively, so if that's what you're looking for, this is it."
4,White Noise summary,"Don Delillo's White Noise is unique and interesting. I found it difficult to focus on at first, but once I discovered the meaning of the novel I appreciated it more. The novel's main theme is about the fear of death. I soon discovered the symbolism and humor in the story, which made it easier to understand and more interesting. Delillo has captured what no other author of the book's I have read has, he has written a book about nothing and about something. The beginning of the book is all dialouge about everyday things that most people face. The second part is all about a toxic airborne event, and the last part deals with Jack's jealous and angry rage, which started because of his wife Babette taking Dylar. This book is very different, but enjoyable."
1,Ugh.,"Probably the worst book I ever read. Oh, why you ask? Because the writing was annoying, the characters shallow, the narration pretentious. It takes more than snide comments about ""life in America these days"" to make a good novel. Satire is so often on a lowest level of art, because it presumes to show ""us"" (whoever ""us"" is) how shallow and absurd ""our"" lives are. However it completely misses the mark when the readers life is not shallow, boring or controlled by what's in the aisles of supermarkets. Social criticism in literature is so tedious and common, written so that the ""intelligent observers"" can have a generic laugh at ""society"" and feel superior. I am not impressed."
2,alright already,"I did not finish 'White Noise'. After about 60 or 100 pages I began hearing a little voice saying, ""I think I get it"". But hammering away at a not very complex point is only one of the book's annoying faults. The book makes the point that there's a lot of useless information that can take up space in our minds over and over and over. All the characters, incidentally, had virtually the same voice; the 14 year old used the same cadence and vocabulary as the college professor. The book seems to be targeted toward mental masochists that enjoy or are, perhaps, proud of the 'head-full-of-crap' condition. In this way the book is a condemnation of a certain kind of liberal arts education. If the condemnation is unintentional then I feel sorry for the author and the reader. If it is intentional - alright, already."
1,The Beginning of the End of the Novel,"Delillo's disese has been spreading ever since this novel was published. The redundent fragments, the uncomphrehensable descriptions, and the false meaning that is being controlled by his illiterate notions of the dreaded ""conspiracy"".Delillo's attempt to debase literature and humanity is praised which makes it that much more ironic and ultimatley a pathedic sign of the power of publicity."
2,This book was informative and somewhat interesting,"White Noise was an interesting book. However, I never fully understood the plot of the book. I didn't ever see any climax or anything that would grab my attention. The book was alright. I found myself falling asleep at certain points."
4,"Slow, interesting, worth a read.","Started out pretty slow but ramped up. A good author with well-written and thoughtful prose. Not super-high on my list of life-changing but hey, it's worth a read."
2,suburbia just isn't this strange,"DeLillo is supposed to be one of our best contemporary novelists. Alas, when I picked up this book, I found a world of Hitler obsessions, death worries, multiple divorces, sexual blackmail, and toxic waste disasters. Perhaps there is some satyrical level that I didn't get, but I couldn't identify with any of this. THe characters are two dimensional and the story is too outlandish to be taken seriously.Is it my imagination, or are contemporary novels supposed to be bizarre? Sure, American suburbs are like an odd bubble in history, but no one I know is this crazy. This is mediocre."
1,Parody at its worst,"The author is so caught up saying something about modern society, he forgets that he is telling a story. The characters are weak and poorly written. The plot is so thin, I could see through the pages.A theme from this book is the placebo effect, but I think its ironic that this very book has its own placebo effect. Some people seem to actually trick themselves into thinking there is a story that is worth telling in this book. To these people I would say, ""I have some sugar pills that cure whatever ails you."" The fact is there was no story at all."
2,Waste of time,WTF. This book didn't go anywhere. The write up was about an epic event that effects the town. Event happens and nothing happens. The last page was like someone just pulled the plug out of the TV in mid story.
2,DeLillo's Best Work,"... which isn't saying much. Boring, Repetitive, no plot whatsoever. My wife gave up in disgust. I finished it only because it reminded me of college and the inanities I used to read in the student newspapers. If you want humorous writing, read Dave Barry - he does it so much better!"
2,Pynchon comparisons odious and highly misleading,"What can I say? I don't read contemporary novels. I've been creeping toward more modern novels and had just read and was floored by Thomas Pynchon's book 'V.'. There is no basis for comparison here. White Noise does not stand up to the test of time even 20 years after it was written. Some of the concepts may have been ahead of their time, but they seem trite in retrospect. This is a light-weight throw away that has nothing important to say, although it desperately tries, about the human condition. I didn't find it particulary amusing, thought-provoking, or challenging and I didn't feel any compassion toward the main character as he spiraled toward the thinly-veiled conclusion. Better him than me."
5,Ahead of its time,I read this book almost 10 years ago. It is a poignant and succinct view of the problems we face as an American society that cannot be solved by simply blaming our government for [enter your cause here]. I am amazed how accurately Mr. DeLillo captured the feeling of our world post 9/11. I look forward to reading it again and again.
3,Not really a novel but more like a manual for critiquing contemporary experiance,"In some ways, this didn't really strike me as being a novel. It seems more like a kind of schematic for analyzing the roots of the contemporary experience. Every action and thought, no matter how petty or menial is shoved through this uber-critical filter and boiled down into its constituent parts. It manages to be incredibly funny and stinging at the same time. I know a lot of people think it's dated but the dialogue still shines, and underneath it all you see a culture that with it's constant anxieties about death and the apocalypse somehow manages to be deeply entrancing in spite of how utterly facile and disgusting it can be. Kind of like with Johnathen Franzen, for whom this seems like a big influence, Delillo weaves a sort of catastrophe that we might not be looking for, but which we really want to see when we run across it"
4,Beautiful payoff,"I'll admit this one can drag a bit in many places, I put it on the back burner 3 times before finishing it. But once you get to the end it really does change the way you see the rest of the book and makes you want to read it again. If you meet someone who says it was pretentious ask them if they finished it. The author is clearly in on the truth about his charactors and people like them in real life."
4,One Hell of a Book!,"White Noise is a satire about the fear of death, and the Postmodern-American Family's place in a socity of advertising images and mass consumerism. A brilliant social commentary on American culture."
5,Pleasing,"I can't believe how many poor reviews this novel is receiving. I absolutely adore this book. I thought it was brilliant. The writing is great and the dry sense of humor kept me laughing. This was one of the few books that really made me think. I'm a literature major and there have been many times where I'll like and appreciate a book, but it doesn't mean much to me ... it's just another novel in collection. But this book was moving. It really changed my outlook and my perceptions of life. It wasn't life altering or anything ... but it definitely made me think about things I didn't think about before. Plus, it's just a great read. It's fun and flowing. I found it hard to put down. Utterly enjoyable."
3,Too clever for its own good,"I'll start with a warning. I'm not a big literary person, so maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough for this book.It's certainly not like anything I've read before, but the message seems buried in absurd characters, weird plot developments, and constant references to pop culture. You think it must be deep and meaningful, because it's hard to understand what the point of everything is. But you have to wonder if the ideas could be expressed in a more straightforward, accessible way that would be more powerful than this story, which many times gets a bit muddled with its absurdities.That said, I did find myself reading chapter after chapter, unable to put the book down, more out of curiosity as to what would happen next, more than anything else.It's sort of like the bus ride I took from Houston to Columbus, OH. Interesting experience to do once, but not a second time."
2,"Long winded, dialog heavy","A long long meditation on death. If you like to hear professors droning on about their obsession with death, without being particularly witty or profound, read this. Delillo tries so hard to be deeply insightful about the nature of human obsession with death, that his characters just end up sounding stilted, pompous, and frankly, ridiculous. Sure there are some great moments and characters- like Heinrich, or Denise, but none of them gets enough screen time. The Airborne toxic event is squashed into a few rushed chapters, and even though the book isn't trying to be a disaster thriller, there was so much potential in the moments in the barracks, all wasted."
2,"There was a differnt style to the writing of ""White Noise""","""White Noise"" was an interesting book because the problems that each character dealt with were not the termed ""normal"" problems of today's society. Most people don't have an underlying fear of death that compels them to do outrageous things. Also, not very likely will you see an entire area of a city evacuate because of a cloud. These points made the story a bit hard for me to follow because I couldn't relate to the characters. The book does however keep your attention after the first section. The book finally develops a story line to follow."
1,"Boring, makes your head spin","I had to read this book for a course on 20th century novels. I found it to be mostly plotless and nearly a complete waste of time to read. If the author hadn't been praised in the past for other novels he'd written perhaps I wouldn't have been assigned this and my time would have been better spent on a more worthwhile text. The book was unrealistic as well, if it was trying to make a point about the real world I didn't get it. Thank you for your time."
1,How sad if this is one of the great books from the 80's.,"I read an article comparing Don Delillo and Chuck Palahniuk's writing style. What an awful comparision. I have read two Delillo books and both have been dreadfully boring.In White Noise the characters are annoying and the conversations are awful. The book seems to have very little purpose and goes no where. If this is one of the great books of the 80's, I will not be reading any more books from the 80's."
3,Many funny ideas trying hard to be a novel,"I love the Hitler Studies department, and the way the main character tries to dress like he knows how to speak German! This is all too realistic in academia, and is just hilarious to me.A few other cool ideas are floating around in this book (toxic cloud)... But for all that I tried, I just couldn't get myself to care about any of these characters. They all seemed flat, almost statistical abstractions. (The protagonist's wife seemed like a poll-driven sketch of a soccer mom.) They seemed much more obsessive and fearful about life's petty poisons and rivalries than most people. Convenient, I suppose, for the purpose of the plot.I come away saying, ""Nifty jokes,"" but without any sense that deep themes were plumbed or that I had gotten to know any interesting characters."
3,"thoughtful & quirky dialogue, but characters are homogeneous","The story flowed right along, but I was slightly annoyed by the fact that all the characters, from Gladney's 14 yr son to the aging father-in-law to the wierd nun at the end, all speak with the same cynical and stylized voice."
2,"Dated, Not Funny, Overrated","A selection of my book group, I must confess to being totally underwhelmed by this National Book Award winner. This is the book that cemented Delillo's reputation as one of the modern greats, but I really failed to see much in beyond some pretty tepid superficial sniping at modern American culture and lifestyles. Set in a fictional town somewhat akin to Pittsburgh, the book's hero is a college professor of Hitler studies. It takes his (and his wife's) fear of death and seemingly tries to tell the reader that while they are so obsessed with death, they are missing out on life--in no small part due to all the ""white noise"" that forms our popular culture. I never found any of this particularly amusing or insightful, however I was in the minority of my bookgroup in this one, so take my opinion with a grain of salt... I guess."
3,Interesting Satire,"Don Dellilo's 'White Noise' features an all-too familiar professor of 'Hitler Studies' at a fine college where he lives with his wife and precocious children. He admits that he does not speak German and is not particularly interested in the politics of Nazism, he is interested merely in the culture. This novel is a curiously fun combination of academic/farce, social satire, dystopia, and post-modern experiment. The characters live embedded in 'White Noise,' they are immersed in the 1980's culture of static/electronic meaninglessness until a chemical spill is unleashed and changes everyone's lives forever. I enjoyed Dellilo's dark and sardonic prose immensely, but I couldn't help feeling that his metaphors became a bit obvious as the story progressed. Dellilo becomes less and less concerned with his characters and more concerned with his themes. This is of course an entirely subjective preference, but I grew detached from this work as the fine characters drifted into the symbolic."
4,"Jane, get me off this crazy thing!","DeLillo's White Noise effectively places a spotlight on all inanities of modern, western society. Like a surgeon wielding a scalpel he carefully dissects pop-culture through hyperbole and satire to create a memorable tale. I think DeLillo develops a central question -- have we, as a 'civilized' group, evolved and how is this evident in postmodern civilization? Through a droll examination of the family, our conduct in society (especially putting on appearances), the regimentation by which we conduct ourselves, our dependency on technology, our constant inundation by media, and our seeming wantonness to destroy the earth (there's so much more!) I got the impression that we are no better off than Neanderthals and in some respects worse. What a thought provoking novel! I could read it over and over."
5,bombdiggity,The book was an excellent satire on many of society's stereotypes and conceptions. The way the author handles death in a nonchalant and almost satirical way is brilliant. The issues and wordplay are tremendous as a book about basically nothing is transformed into a great work.
4,Great read,I just don't understand the reviewers who hate this one. It's a great tale about human nature and the fear of death. A great book.
5,"The glorious buzz of Dellilo's ""White Noise""","You have reached the peak of postmodern writing. DeLillo mixes the common with theextraordinary, leaving the reader somewhere inbetween. The characters interact with each otherwithout understanding. Silence becomes the loudest form of expression. Every confusion and clarityfades together in a background glow that becomes an overwhelming ""White Noise."" Where do wego from here? DeLillo himself would probably admit the evasiveness of this question, and would beproud his book elegantly does not answer it."
1,A Divided Jury,"I first read this book some time ago. I remember it as being one of the least memorable books I ever read. Friends whose opinion in these matter I value gave it very high praise. I read it again. The jokes were D.O.A., the satire limp, indeed nothing. My wife recently picked it up and struggled to finish it, it was so boring. The jury seems strongly divided on this book. Check it out at the library and test drive it, then buy if you like it."
3,"Dated, 80ish writing and humor","This book is sorely dated. What might have been hip and humorous in the 80s is sadly anachronistic today. Hitler Studies, toxic spill drills, dysfunctional families, all the devices that made this story a page turner in '85 reads like a festpool of cliches today. Nabakov's Lolita deals with similar themes but is a far superior book that is as fresh today as when it was released. Read White Noise nevertheless for what critics and audiences thought was groundbreaking stuff in the 80s."
5,Further Reading for fans,"I adored this book. If anyone out there feels the same, I would like to recommend another book that is similar but deliciously different: ""A Wild Sheep Chase"" by Haruki Murakami. It's the Eastern version of the postmodern crisis undergone by Jack and his family in White Noise."
2,What I Thought of White Noise,Boring and depressing for no apparent reason. Reading it felt like doing psychotherapy.
2,"This book was interesting, but it seemed to drag at times.","""White Noise"" by Don DeLillo is about the everyday life of a college professor in a small town in middle America. It gives an intellectual approacch to the little things of the characters life. Although this is interesting at times, there is often too much analysis and gets a bit redundant. Especially the talk of Jack and Babette's fear of death, which occurs throughout the book. After a while, I got very tired of this talk of death and the analysis seemed too much and unnecessary. This makes the book drag and at times I didn't want to read any further because I knew what was coming. DeLillo succeed in making the reader think and that may be enough to make it a book worth reading."
2,White Clutter,"I am beginning to wonder if the babyboomer generation has equated pith and slick irony as intelligence. White Noise is a book austensibly about death, the meaning of life and the frivolousness of consumerism.Mr. DeLillo has created a small world where moderately interesting people take great pains to be clever, bathed in non-sequitors and absorbed in seemingly silly arguments. I will say, however, for every 5 ridiculous conversations played out, there is one that contains the germ of an interesting thought or concept. When Jack and Murray have a discussion about death, rage, meaning and the reaching of conclusions based on honest reflection, the insight and complexity of the books' intent come to the fore.I wish there was more depth, less faux tongue-in-cheek patter in this work."
3,very surprising.,I had no Idea that Dom dilluise could write!I mean this is some rather exceptional stuff considering that his most known gig was to play second fiddel to a toupee toting moustache.Bravo Dom!
2,Well written trash,"I enjoyed listening to Delillo's sentences. His skill with structure is almost poetic in that these sentences have flow and rhythm that a poet would love.Having said that, I really didn't like this book. It starts out confused, and ends up confused. Delillo could have written this in a single chapter, and he wouldn't have lost anything. The fear of death, hiding from reality in the white noise, even the sexual connotations of our world, all could have been put into one short story, and it would have been interesting, besides.The sentences have balance, flow, and beauty. The novel does not."
3,Good job but couldn't captiavte me,"This book is tough for me to review, because I both liked it and became bored by it. Delilo's language and style is fresh. He did an excellent job creating the feeling of the modern, it's relationships and themes. And it is a funny book in an absurd, pathetic way. The difficulty I had with the story was with the characters. I couldn't seem to get into a Hitler professor, an aging stair climber, know it all health concious kids, or the ""white noise"" cloud surrounding their lives. It's probably me, I live in a cabin in Alaska very far away from Delilo's White Noise. I recognize, and I think he did a good job depicting it, the story just didn't hold my interest. Mixed review."
3,Preposterous I Say!!,"DeLillo's had such a wild imagination to write in 1984-85 about the reliance on pharmaceuticals to make oneself ""happy"", the deleterous power of mass communication on society, the delution of the family unit and the daily worry that some calamity, with the potental of causing mass destruction upon your friends and family, could just drop out of the sky - boy did DeLillo get it wrong! Thank goodness it just some half-baked attempt at fiction and not some harbinger of what could ever happen here in America. The government and society would never stand for such things.Next he'll be writing about some kind of crazy global terrorist threat and how our constitutional rights would be methodically underminded by our government,while society, too self-absorbed watching auto racing or Entertainment Tonight, to notice or care. Gee wouldn't that be some crazy inplausable writing...eh????!!!"
2,The scintillating grace of a wet firecracker,"Written in 1984, DeLillo's delightfully obscure novel plows through a slice of prescient postmodern America at a time when America was stubbornly modern. However, anyone born since 1970 is environmentally sophisticated enough to breeze across this tattered landscape of a book with merely a nod. One might even wonder if perhaps the book was the result of a prolonged sleep deprivation jag as nothing seems to hang together in any but the most tangential, immaterial sort of way. There are assaults on meaning and symbol, but none calculated to break through into the realm of shared consciousness or gravity.A puzzling book, either a mild success or a grand failure, but not much else to be appreciated. Save your money for some meaningful white noise of your own and check this out from the local library, instead."
3,"Works as a commentary, but not really as a novel","With WHITE NOISE, the Gladney family and any other characters exist primarily for the purpose of giving DeLillo a sounding board; they were created to give voice to the author's commentary on such diverse topics as comsumerism, death, religion and even the toxicity of the world we live in. As such, they serve their purpose, yet they really never come to life. They live in such a controlled environment that they seem to function more like experiments than actual people; DeLillo makes his points but his creations never achieve an existence that will capture the reader. What will fascinate is how prescient DeLillo is and how well he is able to capture so many truths about America. It is just a shame he didn't decide to do it with characters that might possibly have existed in the real world."
5,I can't stop rereading this novel.,"The narrator, Jack Gladney, is a professor of Hitler Studies, a program he created in order to be a sort of celebrity figure and even an American icon. Of course his ambition is an absurd one. To erect Hitler studies as a ""product"" like Panasonic and Lexus is to be morally disconnected from the meaning of Hitler. But of course Jack is drunk, like most Americans, on commercialism. He believes, erroneously, that commercialism at its best converts mundane things into icons, giving them the power to transcend the one thing that nags Jack above all else--death. His misguided attempt at transcendence results in an amazing final scene that I cannot divulge for fear that the current reader has not yet read the novel.Final note: The book contains priceless aporphisms that are for me the real treasure of the novel."
2,Lost interest,"Sorry, but the book didn't grab me. I lost interest about 100 pages in. Neither the story nor the characters were interesting enough to carry on."
3,Tank Police,"O.K. this DVD was alright. The movie was good, but the DUB sound track was way off. If you liked the orginal soundtrack you're better off seeing this DVD in Japanese. They changed the songs. Example: the part where the girls strip, the orginal was a cool sexy slow song, but the DUB version sounds like pure rock and ruins the mood."
5,Brings back memories....,I love this movie it brings back memory as when I was younger when I first saw it... Those were the good old days. This is how anime looked in the 80s; one would argue that this is a/one of the benchmarks of anime. I'm not an anime collector but this is a movie that should be in the shelves of anyone who loves anime. I recommend this.
2,A dissapointment,"When I first purchased this DVD movie, I had fond memories of the first Anime I ever saw. Dominion Tank Police had a good storyline first captured my attention a few years ago. When I watched the DVD, I was disappointed. Not because of the storyline, or music, but because the DVD conceals the nudity found in the original version in very uncreative ways that are very distracting from the plot. For example, objects are placed in front of the offending areas in ways that would have you beg for black bars instead. Because one of the most important features in a DVD is the Extra features, I consider ANY omission, or concealment to severely hurt the value of a DVD."
2,"Not a great toy, but a great collectable piece",Our 7 year old loves Star Wars and wanted a C-3PO. This one looked like so much fun since it is from the scene in the movie where Chewbacca has to carry him out in pieces. But that being said he easily falls back apart during play (especially his head!) so it is not as durable as the other figures. But he is pretty neat and my son still likes him. It all depends on what you want it for!
5,ASK QUEENOLDGUY,"I AM A BABY BOMMER OF 47.I LIVED AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE NAVAL HOSPITAL IN SOUTH PHILLY.AS A YOUNG GUY I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO GO TO WAR.AS I MATURED AND WORLD HISTORY BECAME NOT JUST A SUBJECT IN SCHOOL.BUT IT BECAME MY HOBBY AS IT IS TODAY.FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE :CRUSADE IN THE PACIFIC: WAR IS NOT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT BUT I WOULD RECONMEND THIS FIVE DISC SET,SHOULD BE SHOWN TO EVERY 9TH GRADER HERE IN AMERICA.IT WILL SHOW WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS MADE OF?IF YOU LIKE HISTORY THE PRICE IS WORTH IT."
4,Authoritative,"My 84 year father, a WWII vet of the Pacific Theater, was mesmerized by these episodes. The Pacific is a neglected aspect of WWII history in comparison to the European Theater of Operation so I was glad I came across this. ""Crusade in the Pacific"" is thorough and knowledgeable."

3,GOOD MEMORABILIA - MEDIOCRE REPRODUCTION,"The Jasmine CD is of original film soundtracks. As a result, it includes a number of songs not usually found in her albums - Goodbye, Danny Boy, Lover, and The Old Refrain. That's great! Unfortunately, Jasmine didn't take the time/effort to bring them up to the fidelity level found in some of Durbin's other CD's. And, since it's a collection of soundtracks, you occasionally get snatches of dialogue you don't find in her studio recordings. Altogether - pleasant and worthwhile, but there are better examples of her music available."
2,"Too Basic, But Easy To Read",I work in the construction industry as a secretary and I bought the Construction Dictionary for my desk so I could look up some of the more obscure words when I type letters and proposals. This dicitionary is really easy to read but the words are too basic. It would be a good dictionary for someone new to the business but if you need a more diverse set of words this is not the dictionary for you. It's priced right for the beginner.
5,Serves a Purpose,I am new to the estimating and construction management world and I find this little dictionary incredibly helpful. I use it often when reading prints and listening in on meetings. When words come up that I don't know I look 'em up and I've yet to come across one I couldn't find in this book. Maybe not so good for veterans of construction but perfect for me.
2,meh,"decent at best. thought it was a little light. also, the size is not really pocket sized. unless you have really BIG pockets."
3,bad choice,This was a bad choice for me as a single woman to purchase. The battery was supposed to have a green light that went OFF when the battery was charged. It plugged in RED and stayed RED. I think this would have been returned in any case but the battery stopped me from even trying out the product.
2,extremely disappointed with quality of the product,"Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Electric Chain Saw #CCS818received this item from amazon friday june 6,2008 and filled it with oil. all the oil leaked out the bottom in 5 minutes contacted the help desk who had zero product knowledge ""a supervisor will call you"" they never did sent online inquiry ""we will rush you a new oil tank cap""! oil leaked out bottom where there isn't any cap therefore their solution isn't a solution no chain saw to use for my projects..no solution in hand will return this ""oily saw"" somehow not a good product to order online as it's difficult to get fixed and a ""mess"" to return i made a big mistake on this one"
1,Not good,I agree with the other low-raters. This is almost toy-like in its wimpiness. The battery cycle is extremely limited and the chain dulls readily. I would have already returned it if I hadn't let the return period lapse. I would not buy it again and will think twice before buying another B&D battery-operated item.
3,B&D Cordless Chainsaw,"A very handy tool, but it appears to be for small cuts and not for an average tree. I am still experimenting with the saw and expect to know more about it in the next few months.I like the battery pack because it is compatible with three other tools that I have."
2,"OK for brief small work, terrible battery life.","This chainsaw has the power, cutting speed, and weight of a reciprocating saw, which frankly has many more uses. Its real battery life, i.e. chain-moving-cutting-wood is about 3 minutes. I have two batteries and they are about the same, the worst of any battery tool I own. Battery recharging is an absurd 8 hours. Contrast that with a Dewalt reciprocating saw (Dewalt is owned by Black & Decker!) which has a cutting time of about 20 minutes and a recharge of under an hour. I cannot recommend this chainsaw, but you know what to buy instead."
5,Real Handy,This little saw works great in confined spaces. Also saves time when I setup for small jobs.
4,Cordless Electric Chain Saw,"I'm trying to get use to the cordless electric chain saw. The chain really has to be tight. When you put oil into the saw, it can leak out. So I am still learning what to do with the saw. If the chain is not right, it will not cut so well. The battery charges well."
2,Don't expect much,"This is the first electric chain saw I've used - and it will be the last. It took me three days to cut a couple fallen tree branches (15' long,8"" diameter) into fire logs. Yes...three days. The battery pack lasted just long enough to make about 3 cuts - then it needed to be recharged. My recommendation - if you can handle a gas mower - stick with it. If not, stock up on battery packs - because you're going to need them for this chainsaw. As for me, I'm going back to gas."
2,Not a real chain saw,"I would describe the Black & Decker 18V Cordless Chain Saw as a toy if it were any fun at all to use. Unfortunately, it is neither fun to use nor a real chain saw. It will put a nice score on the branch you're trying to cut, but in the end you'll have to go get your hand saw to finish the job.If you need a chain saw, buy a real gas-powered chain saw."
1,most useless I ever bought,"this saw will take longer to cut a 2x4 then using a hand saw,just a total waste of money,if you are able to cut more then 5 2x4's on one charge consider yourself lucky"

IF ANYONE WANTS MORE THAN THE MOST BASIC CUTTING, THEY SHOULD GO WITH GAS!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,good little chainsaw,"I've had this a couple of weeks and I've used it to remove several dead small trees planted along the fence and side of my new house. It's a nice little chainsaw that will get your little jobs done quickly. It's nice for me because I'm not very comfortable with using a full sized chainsaw. It's light weight and has a trigger starter rather than your traditional pull start. These allowed me to feel more in control and comfortable using the saw. It was fairly easy to assemble. The only draw backs are that it doesn't come with a small bottle of chainsaw blade oil. So it's not ready to go right out of the box. Not a big deal if you know that you need it. Also the oil does drip after you use it. Which may be normal, but this is my only one, so I'm not sure. You'll want to place something under the blade to keep the oil from staining the area under it. It's not meant to cut down a forest, but it's great for light jobs. A very good little chainsaw."
1,Poor for ANY Purpose,"I've been pleased with other B&D 18v products - esp the drill - but this is a complete waste of money and time, even for the lightest yard cutting job that other reviewers note. Especially difficult if you are working with green wood - and what light cutting work doesn't include green branches/small live trunks? The saw doesn't really cut - it tears and chews and consistently kicks back, no matter the chain tension. The leaking the other reviewers pointed out is more than annoying - you end up going through much more oil than is necessary. PLEASE learn from my mistake and avoid this truly awful product!"
2,B & D Cordless Chain saw,"Nice looking, well designed product. Those are the good things. Battery life leaves a lot to be desired. Could only get about thirty minutes of cutting time. Speaking of charge, it REALLY needs a quick charger. Once the battery runs down, you are without the saw for about eight to ten hours. I needed a small, light weight saw to carry in a back pack and this is NOT it."
1,Leaky product,"We recently purchased this through Amazon. The chain saw leaks oil terribly - it's awful. Plus, it was missing the needed Allen wrench tool that was supposed to come with it.It cuts ok but be prepared to store carefully. I would not put oil in the holder - we'll be doing what another reviewer said - mannually oiling the chain from now on."
5,Great for small work,I purchased this for cleaning up errant privett hedge and it works wonderfully.
4,Hard working light-weight,"An excellent, light weight chain saw for pruning and small diameter cutting. Be sure to have a backup battery/ies if you need to do more than 15 minutes of serious limb cutting and pruning -the only downside to this otherwise excellent homeowner's assistant."
4,This is a great saw!!!,This is a great chainsaw for small projects. I haven't had any trouble with the oil dripping or the chain loosing up as other people have reported. It is lightweight and very convenient. Much better than starting up the big saw for tree limbs and small trees. For the price you can't beat it...very pleased. Just ordered another one for my brother-in-law and he is a logger in Maine. He was impressed with the power and lightness of the saw when he tried my out. Can't get a much higher review than that from someone who has been cutting logs for over 55 years.
3,Black & Decker Cordless Chainsaw,"I've bought this Chainsaw to take with me whenever I go to the farm and use it to cut grap-vine around the trees and cut some wood for camping.Con's:1. the oil resorvior is way too small and if you over fill (by accident) it well go all over the battary.2. the battary does not last long enugh and there is no indecator to tell you how much jouice left.Pro's:1. still easir than a normal chain-saw.2. easy to handle.3. less noise.This is why I gave it 3 stars, if the battary can hold more like the craftsmen then this product would've been EXCELLENT..."
3,B&D 18V Chainsaw,"Good for quick and small jobs. Battery useage not an issue if you have two or more as I do.One big gripe - its messy, leaks oil."
1,don't bother with this one,"I thought that this little saw would be a good alternative for a 65 year old woman who wanted to trim and/or cut down small trees. I was wrong. After charging the saw for the required number of hours, I proceeded to attempt to cut down a small dead tree. Any necessary preliminary branch trimming was done with a small bow saw, so the only cutting that this saw did was the necessary cuts to fell the tree. Well, I had to finish with the bow saw to even get the tree down because the Black & Decker ran out of juice. Granted, dogwood is pretty hard wood, but it made me think about the people who wrote the 4 & 5 star reviews on this product. Were they cutting down 1 inch pine sapplings or what? I gave it a second chance: I charged it for another 9-10 hours, it ran out of juice again after a few cuts, and I was stuck hand-sawing again. This is the first time I ever returned anything to Amazon.com, but return it I did. And, yes, it does leak oil all over the place."
1,Cordless Chainsaw,"The chainsaw worked weel the first time I used it. The main thing to remember is that the 8 inch length of the saw is very short and is really only good for pruning small brances, not for cutting down trees or large logs for firewood."
3,Chain Saw,Can't offer much of a review - it's winter - haven't had an opportunity to use this product yet.
4,Does the Job,"I was hesitant when ordering this chainsaw based on other reviews. After several weeks of use I recommend this chainsaw. There are a few things to keep in mind though. First, the blade is not very long and its only 18V; large trees are almost impossible. Second, I also have the 3 piece B&D yard tool set and so I have 3 extra batteries. If battery I'm using gets low I can easily put in another. Lastly, the oil leak others speak of is minimal (if at all) and the saw does take some use and adjustments before optimal performance. Overall, it does what its supposed to."
3,Leaks Chain Oil,"The saw works great, but everytime I fill the chain oil reservoir, the oil leaks out when the saw is not being used."
5,saw,"Coudn't find this saw in the stores, so glad I found it online. Can't wait to be able to use it this spring."
3,Black & Decker CCS818 18-Volt Cordless Electric Chain Saw,One main problem is the lack of chain oilier. It should have an on board pump oilier for the chain. Cuts good and battery last good. Light and compact.
2,Battery Life is too short,"Maybe I got a defective item. The battery life is too short for me. It takes a long time to charge like the other review said but for me, it dies in less than an hour. I am going to return this product.The saw is fine. It does the job. I just hope the battery life can be better."
2,It works??,"The saw works and is adequate for the job I had in mind for it, however I was expeting the battery to last longer. It cut 10-15 pieces of 4"" wood."
2,Disappointed,"Good points: Instruction booklet is well-written. Fairly easy to put together. Is lightweight.Bad points: Battery took over 1 day to charge and died after about 1/2 hour of use which is very frustrating. Had to re-charge it for another 24 hours and try again, and again it ran out of adequate power in 1/2 hour. Seemed to leak oil no matter what, as well."
5,Cordless chain saw,"I purchased this saw to cut wild grape vines and poison vines growing in the trees that are in my 24 acres of woods.There were a lot of the grape vines that were at least 4 inches or more in diameter.The saw performed great,the battery lasted longer than I expected it would before it needed to be recharged.I would recommend it to any one that had this type or size of items to cut."
5,Black & Decker CCS818 18-Volt Cordless Electric Chain Saw,The cordless chain saw was what I expected and it works great for the smaller limbs. It will come in handy thinning dog hair trees.
5,Black and Decker Chain Saw,"The chain saw does all things advertised. Very! good for the ordinary pruning jobs you do thoughout the year. It is not ment to be a replacement for a gas chain saw for major jobs, so if you purcase this saw to be a replacement for an 18 inch gas chainsaw, you will be disappointed."
5,Easy use chain saw,"Have only had this saw for a short time but have enjoyed the ease of use. Nice not having to worry about cutting through an electric cord or the danger of storing gasoline. Imperative to remember to always use the oilier when cutting anything as it not only keeps the chain sharper but makes the job of sawing easier. This is not a toy!!! Works great for smaller limbs and trimming, not for large trees. Just common sense!"
4,mother's day present,"This tool is ideal for me around our farm. Only good for litttle stuff and you have to be real careful with positions and grips as it can grab, etc.I have a small gasoline chain saw but can never start it since it has gotten older (got it for mother's day 5 years ago).This B&D; is very easy to start. Have to watch the oil reservor as it uses up pretty quickly.Of course the gasoline once started cuts much better, faster, bigger limbs but this little one allows me to do some trimming without bothering my spouse to start up his big gas one or my little gas one."
5,NICE SAW!!,NICE SAW FOR LIGHTER SAWING JOBS!! I WOULDNT SELL MY GAS POWERED SAW BUT THIS SAW HAS ITS SPOT. I PUT THIS SAW IN THE BOX OF MY ATV AND DO TRAIL CUTTING WHILE I RIDE. NICE TO HAVE FOR TREE STAND TRIMMING. CUTS NICE WIYH THE SMALLER BRANCHES. AN EXTRA BATTERY OR 2 IS A MUST IF YOU GOING TO BE DOING A BUNCH OF CUTTING!!
4,Very satisfactory,Coming down from a high powered Stihl to this less powerful electric is quite a shift. But it will work for most small jobs. Suggest getting some extra batteries.
5,Great little saw,"I really like this saw. It works great on my tree branches. It's light, and the battery has lasted longer than I expected on one charge."
4,Satisfied,This Black & Decker Cordless Chain Saw is excellent for small to medium trees and general use in the back yard. It is light weight and not clumsy to handle. Only complaint is that the oil holder is not large enough because it uses up the oil too quickly. Could design the equipment to use less oil.
4,Grooming chairman for snowmobile club gives thumbs up,"My favorite saw! We use chainsaws all year around to keep our snowmobile trails clear. In the winter months, most of the trees that we come across are small trees bent over the road from heavy snow load. Getting out one of the big saws takes time to get it started and running properly before being able to use it. This little saw is perfect for those small and quick cuts. It is light and small and super easy to use. We can keep it inside the snow cat under the seat. No gas fumes, no power cords. One good battery will last most of the day. However, anything larger than five to six inches is a huge battery drain and is best handled by one of our gas saws. Our club has two of these saws and two of the Black & Decker 18-volt polesaws for tree limbing. Wonderful products. Only thing that I would like to see improved is auto chain oiling. This saw has a thumb pushbutton, and the polesaw comes with a small oil bottle."
5,Electric Chainsaw,I am a girl living on a 5 acre property in Hawaii where things grow fast.This chainsaw is lightweight and handy - great for branch trimming and cutting of smaller dead trees.I have 2 battery packs which last long enough to do the job.
4,Pruning anyone?,"Good saw for small jobs. I have cut 4""+ limbs, however don't force the saw,you will stall the blade. Blade speed could be better. Suggest purchase additional battery so you can keep going. Can be used 1-handed but as always, Work Safe."
4,Excellent lopper,"If you are expecting a ""chainsaw"", it meets the literal definition, but if you are expecting to cut down trees, don't. This is the third chainsaw in the lineup for us, in line behind my Husqvarna 20 something inch gas and my corded electric. For little things away from the house, this is perfect. Where the gas saw will require rest breaks about every half hour when doing serious cutting, you can cut as long as you have battery power with this. We have other B&D; 18v tools, so batteries are not a problem here.As an example usage, we used both gas and cordless last weekend, the gas saw chewing through mesquite trunks & roots easily, and we could use the cordless to take off the branches so we could haul everything away. Very nice tool to have.Biggest mark against is the tiny (looks like ~1/4 cup) oil reservoir, it's next to useless, so we use a regular oil can, and just oil the chain completely manually. Easy to set tension, I like that the wrench is stored in the handle."
4,good little cordless at great price,Once u get batteries fully charged(I have 3 now) this is a great around the house addition. If you want to saw up cord wood in the woods get a nice gas one. That is not what this one was made for.I bought it for my girlfriend so she could work around the yard without messing with a gas one and she loves it. The oiler doesn't work real well and make sure u have FULL charges on ur batteries before u start a project. I bought an extra chain for mine and have one getting sharpened by a buddy of mine while I use the other. All in all a good purchase with a few minor setbacks. ;-)
5,Great Product,"I got this saw an extra battery and the quick charger. After reading the reviews I figured this would just a trim saw, boy was I mistaken. This little brute has taken down and cut up at least 20 4 and five inch trees over the last 3 months. I've taken down a few 10 and eleven incher with some creative cutting. We had a storm last night and I had to deal with 6 downed trees that were in the 5 and 6 inch size. they were spread over a 10 acre area. It was pretty nice to only having to carry this little thing compared to a gas saw. Great buy."
3,Other Chainsaws,"This chainsaw isn't bad but it will have trouble cutting 8-10 inch trees in diameter. The better chainsaws are the oregonpower now 40v lithium ion and Stihl 36v lihtium ion. Oregon has a self sharpening feature while Stihl has a cordless self tension. Although oregon and stihl chainsaws are more expensive, they are definitely worth buying over Black and Decker. The power in those saws is just superior to Black and Decker, and more reliable (lithium ion has no memory effect). In fact, Oregon 40v chainsaw works for a lot of jobs if diameters of trees are less than or equal to 12 inches. I think the stihl msa 160 (36 v lithium ion cordless) can cut up to 10 inches."
2,"Once it works, it's mediocre","Do not buy this product unless you are already an experienced chain-saw user. The blade comes packed seperaely and must be installed, which takes three hands. Then the tension must be adjusted and oil added. Adjusting the tension is difficult, because they paut the screw right next to the blade, which means you only get about half a turn and then have to withdarw the tool they give you and find the slot in the black screw(hard to see)all over again. In addition, there are no markings about which way to turn the screw for the desired effect.If you do buy this saw, read the instrctions. They are actually well written, even though it's hard to perform the tasks described.The saw seems to have enough power to do its job, but getting it adjusted so that you can use it is difficult and keping it that way for more than a few cuts is much more difficult."
3,Doesn't cut long on a charge,"Handy saw... lightweight and effective. That is, while the battery charge holds out, which isn't very long at all. And, the battery takes at least five hours to re-charge. So, if you need to do more than trim a few branches, pick up several batteries. Or buy a gas chain saw to begin with."
2,No power for dry hardwoods,"Tried this out on some small dried hardwood (maple, locust & cherry) chunks no larger than 3"" in diameter. Tough going. The blade really has no power. Might work on green woods better. In other words--just for trimming on live wood. OK for use by a landscaper--not for a small farm. (I was looking for a saw I cold get used to using before tackling the ""big saws."""
3,not the fastest saw in the shed but very handy,"8inches of blade is great fo the bush trimming and thinning. Battery life is good, power - adequate, run time for cuting 1-3 inche branches was good. Chain oiler is messy, hard to fill and empties quickly.... as if there is a leak... but I am not goig to take this saw a part to see how this was supposed to work but the chain oilder is a disappointment and requires constant wiping off the run down.( this may be why the price is so good). vendor service, delivery was great"
4,Excellent light duty chainsaw,"This saw will fell and buck two average trees 5-7"" at the base before the battery pack runs down. I would be inclined to lop manually for small trees like these, so that the battery will last a bit longer, and safety is a bit higher.4 stars since the convenience of use could be improved (would be nice to have a hook or Velcro(r) loop for the scabbard rather than have to keep track of it on the ground, and some kind of retention method for the battery prong cover so that the cover doesn't wander about and get lost). It would also have been nice if B&D; included a little bottle of the non-toxic chain lube like the Alligator Loppers come with, so the user doesn't immediately have to go out buying chain oil before using the saw.Very lightweight and easy to handle, no fumes and minimal kickback. Great value for the price."
5,Enlightening,"We found this book to be excellent in giving information about the ups and downs of swinging. My partner and I are considering the lifestyle, now this book has made us question whether we are really ready to take this step. We did not realize there were so many facets to it and the complications that can occur in certain encounters. The author shared sincerely from his point of view and this is a rare find among the male population for the most part. We had this impression that women rule and for a man to share such intimate details of a deeply personal nature and write it so well was truly refreshing."
4,Innocent Girl Finds Passion,"Kristin Traube finds herself in Breckenridge, Colorado, after an unfortunate mix-up in Chicago over her sister's fiance and a stolen kiss. She never wants to set eyes on Jack Cameron again, but we all should be glad that she does. The sexual tension between the two is fueled by her niave ideas concerning love and marriage in this American historical novel. Chadwick's descriptions of the mining community in Breckenridge and of the ""Chicago Girls"" are entertaining and informative. However, it is her portrayal of Kristin's confused emotions and Jack's unending passion that keep the reader furiously turning the pages to find out if their love for each other will remain elusive after all."
3,Volleyball for the immature adult in you,"I'm going to be very brief in describing this game: Fun. Addictive. Humorous. But not for the kids (adult humor).What more can I say? It's 2-on-2 volleyball, it's got minigames, and the characters are... colorful, to say the least. Put simply, if you've never played an Outlaw game (Outlaw Golf, Outlaw Golf 2, Outlaw Tennis) and you like volleyball, give this game a shot. It's one of those passed over gems from the Xbox years. And who knows, after playing Outlaw Volleyball, you might feel compelled to pick up Outlaw Golf 2 and Outlaw Tennis as well. They may not be serious sports games, but they are entertaining. Although you might want to find a trailer of the game to see if the humor is up your alley."
3,weak volleyball,I had higher expectations after playing outlaw golf. This game focused less on the volleyball and more on the extraneous crap that unstabilized the game. It's locked up my Xbox too many times in the middle of gameplay. The volleyball is weak here. The best volleyball game I've played is Beach Spikers on GameCube. Sad but true.
5,One of His Best ...,"This CD holds a special place in my heart because it was the catalyst of my first date with a very lovely woman. That date was to see Najee in concert ... and it was indeed special in so many ways.Najee is one of Smooth Jazz's best performers (live or recorded) and this CD is but a primer to his abilities. If you have never heard of Najee, then this CD is required listening and will be the start of your Najee CD collection. Each cut has a particular flavor ... from the sweetness of its title track ""Day By Day"" to the funky fun of ""Najee's Nasty Groove"" ... you will get wrapped up in this CD. Listen to it with someone special. Enjoy a snifter of brandy and let it satisfy your senses."
5,It is a great book,"I consider this book very interesting, I just start studing at ESPE, en Army School in Ecuador, but, what I want to know is if you have a work book with answers to the problems we confront in it.If you are able to get one for me i would appreciate your hep."
1,"Where was your editor, Donna Jo?","This book is full of typos, tangents, mistakes, and very, very poor examples. I cannot imagine why any professor would choose to use this as the primary text for a class. I am tempted to mail my copy back to Donna Jo, because I caught her spelling mistakes and crossed out unnecessary sentences, which make up more than half the book. If you are looking for organized, concise explanations of complex materials, do not rely on this book! It is an extremely frustrating read."
1,"Wow, this is bad",This book was absolutely terrible. I can't believe that this woman was actually awarded a PhD and then a professorship at any university. This book is the epitome of anti-academic writing.
1,Awful,"This book is simply terrible. I can't believe it is used in linguistics classes- it is unclear, too complicated for a beginner, and just generally awful. It was terrible enough to use her book, but I also had the bad luck of actually having Napoli as a linguistics professor one semester. She often forgot what she was talking about, made little sense, and was usually just as dizzying as her book. Can't someone write a better introductory linguistics text?"
3,Cute Shoes.,"I bought the shoes because of the great reviews, but I got blisters on my feet the first times I wore them! I'm a serious walker too, and I couldn't wait to go back home to take them off. The sole is very comfortable but the back of the shoe is what killed me. In my case, they needed a break in period, but there is no way I will use them without socks. That's a shame, they are so cute!"
2,Vienna Vilified by Kvetching Chronicler,"Join Frederic Morton on a tour of Vienna in the 1880's. Morton is a very knowledgeable guide. Unfortunately, he has little more than scorn for everything and everyone in sight. I suppose this is why he identifies with the neurotic, pleasure-seeking Crown Prince Rudolf, who was so uncomfortable with his surroundings, and in his own skin, that he committed suicide, after first murdering his seventeen-year-old mistress.After three hundred pages of Morton's nightmare version of this place and time, I'm ready for a more balanced and insightful treatment of the subject. Any recommendations?"
3,Some Like It Hot,"For Billy Wilder, this is formula, done with his left hand. But it entertained in its time; and viewing the young Marilyn Monroe is always pleasant.--Hugh Downs"
3,Steak Branding Iron,"Good service from this company. I bought this as a Christmas present for a family member and both the recipient and others thought it was a great item and certainly the funniest gift of the occasion. Since I have yet to hear if it works, I will stick with three stars for now."
4,Great Solo Album,"I haven't had this CD for even a month, and I've already listened to it about 12 times. This album is both awesome and funny. Buy it if you like Rob Crow or Pinback... or Star Wars."
2,Bad Apple,Looks like someone shot this with a home video camera.I got through the first 5 minutes only. I dont have a problem with low budget but this was beyond any means of that.
2,Campy & Overdone,"""Matrimonium"" is one of the most obnoxious and campy films I have seen. The storyline could have been very creative and entertaining with major adjustments and recasting. First a new TV Show Hostess who was much more believable and realistic would have been required. Deven Green as Andre, TV Show Hostess, lacked substance and appeal. Joel Bryant as Bradley DuBois, best friend of Malcolm Caufield (the straight guy desperately searching for a quick buck) was my favorite character and the most believable. A good concept gone sour!"
2,Poorer quality paper,"This product used to be called ""Brights"" and was manufactured in the US with higher quality paper. I really liked the product until I purchased their current version called ""Five Star"": same notebook but now manufactured outside the US with lower quality paper that forces me to use only one side of each page as the ink runs through if you use liquid ink pens (such as Pilots). I will not be purchasing this item again."
3,I took my chance and I had my thrills,"This album features Willie Dixon performing some of his less well-known songs. Willie was renowned as one of the greatest songwriters and arrangers in the history of the blues. As a singer, he received much less acclaim. This CD shows the reason for that. Willie wasn't a bad singer, but he just wasn't a very exciting singer. He sings adequately here, but his singing is nothing special. Plus, many of the songs here run much longer than they should. This album is for blues completists only."
4,PINBALLS...a short movie,"Eventhough the book is somewhat outdated, I find that my students still enjoy the book. I had seen the after-school-special years ago but was never able to locate it. I was thrilled to find it and I'm sure my students will like it!"
3,Don't hide from this book!,"I picked this paperback up at a book sale and found it to be a quick, easy, fast-paced predictable fun read. The chase scenes were the best with some good sex thrown in for interest, I suppose. The misspelling of some words were distracting, they used the letter f for the letter t and I tried to ignore it. It was a pretty good police procedural and quite the page turner. It might be too naive for some of you hard-boiled mystery buffs, but it was not a waste of time. I might even look for Cold, Cold Heart and compare."
3,Better than average thriller,"This suspense novel is well written though it peters off near the end. Would make a great TV movie. Author is worth watching. As stated, a better than average thriller."
2,"A sappy, derivative (and predictable!) book - skip it...","An Ivy-League-educated model-turned hooker? A noble cop with a tortured soul? A suave but vicious Cuban assasin? A mobster named Johnnie Socks? Spare me. Not only is this book without an original thought, the characters are all caricatures, and Elliot (over)describes everything in sight - he obviously never heard the writer's golden rule of 'SHOW, don't tell'. Will the suffering but noble cop, and hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold fall for each other? Does a mafia goomba wear a pinkie ring? Save your money."
1,You get what you pay for....,"The product description for this fan says it is ""quite"". What a perfect typo, it is supposed to quiet, but they hit the nail on the head. The ""little gem"" is quite a fan. It is loud, kind of sounds like an idling car engine,and made cheaply. You get exactly what you pay for. I will be returning this thing to amazon today."
2,"Fan is relatively quiet, but too much vibration noise","I like the overall design of this fan. It has a small footprint, and it looks nice on my work desk. I was looking for a small fan for my desk as my work office is hot all year round. However, the ideal fan needs to be quiet enough not to interfere with speakerphone conference calls. I can only have it on the low setting while on a call--any higher setting is too loud. I could deal with keeping it on the low setting, however, the dealbreak for me is the random vibration from the unit whether it is stationary or oscillating. If the vibration was consistent and not random, I could write it off as white noise. I've tried placing the fan on a mousepad to absorb the vibration, but the fan housing still vibrates. I'm not fond of the loud beeping either to change the settings. I would definitely have chosen a different fan to suit my needs."
4,Tony Reed,i would have gave it 5 stars but they sent me a used one no happy about that at all.... unit works just like you expect.
4,Great office fan,I have a coworker that turns on her heater every day regardless of the actual temperature. This fan successfully enables me to cool off a little and not disturb the office. I had it for two days and it is terrific so far!
4,Nice for the price,"I have used mine for over a year now in my office and found it to be very nice. I never used the oscillator, but recently tried to and found it doesn't work? But that's fine I don't really need it. If I could complain about one thing it's that ""low"" is more of a medium (strong breeze) and is loud. I'd like to have a lower setting for both less breeze and less noise. It's fine, though, as others have stated, and works like a white noise in the background."
3,Does it's job but build quality is not consistent,"This the second SF-1530I I have bought. There must be issue with either manufacturing or shipping by SPT as while the first one was nice and quiet, the second one you can hear more bearing noise or something loose within the fan so not good for a bedroom environment. Given the inconsistent quality it wasn't worth returning and it does work well to circulate the air in the room and the timer function is useful. Would I buy another one? Not so sure."
1,Disappointed,"The Good: The fan came in a new box, and was well packaged.The Bad: After removing the fan from its original packaging I found it to be in used condition. There were scrapes and gouges all over the body and one of the intake fins was broken off. Not sure how that would have happened unless it were packaged that way to begin with. I thought I could get over the cosmetic damage so I plugged it in to try it out. The fan made a loud whirring noise in any speed but low and I could tell when I picked it up that the blades were out of balance. This thing turned out to be a lemon."
5,Love my desk Fan!,"The fan is very nice on my desk in a cubicle. It has a nice breeze and I like that it can vary. I keep it on low, which is just a nice steady breeze. It looks nice. The only con I can find is that when you turn it on, off or vary the speed it beeps. I find the beep very loud for a silent office atmosphere. If you are in a noisier type of office it may not be noticed. In my office it is sort of like an announcement 'SHE HAS TURNED ON HER FAN AGAIN!' Lol. I am hoping I'll find a way to turn off that beep but if not, I'll still keep using it. I also love that it has an ionizer. The push buttons on the front make it very easy to adjust without having to reach behind or over a fan to make adjustments. They are labeled very clearly. The timing feature is very nice. If it gets towards the end of the day and I turn it on, I could forget to turn it off before I go home so I just set the timer in case I do forget it will go off."
4,Works well but I question if it's really new!,"I just got the fan delivered today and it works well. Unlike some others, I don't find it to be loud at all and i really like that it has a timer on it.But I'm also questioning if it's really a new product as mine also had scratch makes on it. This could be from the cheap labor they use to put this thing together, but even the buttons had dirt marks which really makes me ? it even more.Since it works and the noise isn't bad I'm going to keep it, but I'm also going to place a call to amazon since others seem to have the same issue.But I would buy a 2nd one if I need it, it puts out a nice amount of air and keeps the room cool!"
5,Microsoft Plus Offers Great Options,This product was thoughtfully designed to take advantage of high resolution monitors and CPU's packed with high capacity processors. The graphics are stunning and the choices allow you to switch it around enough times to prevent overexposure from spoiling the enjoyment. It's relatively inexpensive and jazzes up your computer screen saver and desktop themes.
3,Not What Expected,"Had this product not been on sale, I most likely wouldn't have bought it. The new and updated programs and resources are interesting and fun, but not seriously helpful for me. It's worth what I paid, but don't look for anything earth-shattering here."
1,msplus superpack winxpenglishna,"Did not work with my apple computer,requested help but did not get results I wanted which was to return idem & get credit"
3,Just ok,"This is a nice ""software"" package. It includes many ok features such as an alarm clock, bowling game (demo version), auarium screensaver (demo version), audio converter, cd label maker, plus dancers (only comes with about 5 dancers- all others must be downlaoded from web) and other neat features. Before Plus! and Plus! Digital Media edition were sold separatly- so I spent $20 on Plus! and later bought Plus! superpack for $30 but got a $10 mail in rebate. This conatains features that seem functional but in reality, aren't.. things like the alarm clock seem more functional than they realy are. I wasn't that impressed with this package."
1,LOUSY!,"This product is now discontinued, but no one bothers to tell you that before you make your purchase. Yes, it was very inexpensive, but you cannot update anything or register the product any longer!Two thumbs down!"
3,No support for legally licensed WMAs,"I bought this tool so that I could convert my legally purchased WMAs to MP3s. It turns out that the tool doesn't recognize my licenses and the conversion fails because I have no digital rights license, even though I do. I try to use microsoft support but there automated support doesn recognize the product id whether I manually type it in or I let them disover it so I get no free support becuase of the PID problem unless I want to pay $35.00 for the support fee which is more than I paid for the software. Bottom line don't buy this to convert WMAs to MP3s."
4,Microsoft Plus! SuperPack for Windows XP,The product has very good themes and screen savers. Some the other functions are not useful to me but hopefully I will use them in the future.
2,Too much for slower computers,"The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review."
1,Microsoft Plus for Windows XP,"This product has very little to offer. The Plus for Windows 98 was more interesting and offered more 'extras'.This product doesn't have much on it, not worth the money."
2,Good and Bad,I love the screen savers and some of the other applications but this takes up way too much room on my hard drive and slows it down. I have a huge hard drive too. It takes over 250.00 MB's. I had to remove it to free up space. What you get for the price isn't that good.
1,Not worth the hassle,"I purchased this software thinking that I could take my digital images, create a slide show with music, and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch.Unfortunately, the disk that I got gave me some error messages that when I called tech support (one hour hold time)they told me that my error message meant that I could create files, but they'll only run on my computer, not on my tv dvd player. In addition, you need to buy additional dvd burning software, because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the Microsoft logo on them. (The package says the dvds will run on almost any dvd player)So I asked for my money back. However, since it took me more than 30 days to find all of this out, they refused a refund."
1,Not worth the money,"This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this. It adds virtually nothing to XP. Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition. That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product. The themes are nice but far too few for the price. The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things. The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring. Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff. Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money."
2,Not as great a value as appears from the cover,"By reading the cover I thought it would be a great product to have. It indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without.Games - Bowling game is actually a teaser version. You can play only two lanes. Others cost you extra. Two other games are not exciting.Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre.I liked the analog convertor but not too much. If you can get input from any audio device, this program can convert it into a digital format. Alas it doesn't convert to MP3 format. Also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast, but not on the normal speed.Dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions. I liked Ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing.Bottom line - I don't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week."
1,Results poor,"After loading tracks on computer the time for formatting and saving tracks the time required to do so increased as much as three times what it took formally. Detecting adequate signal with Analog Recorder is sometimes ignored and sometimes louder than the volume played on the LP, cassette, or Reel To Reel."
2,JUST TRIAL VERSIONS,THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DECENT SCREEN SAVERS. OTHERWISE IT'S MOSTLY JUNK. SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS TOO CHEAP TO BE EVERYTHING IT CLAIMS.
2,Just Let me BUY..................,"I am new to Amazon.com and all I wanted to do is buy the windows xp super pack, but you just keep showing all these other products and there is nowhere for me to just buy it and go, so I guess you just lost a customer because if you make it this hard for me to check out and be on my way, then I might as well just go to the store and pick it up myself. Thanks anyway but I really dont want to sit here and keep trying to buy this item and getting everything else plus the kitchen sink. So maybe later on down the road I'll try you again and see if youve made it any easier to just put an item in your cart , check out and be done, without all the song and dance about everything else you keep trying to sell me. sincerely, queencolleen."
1,slackpack for windows by microsoft,"microsoft calls it superpack but who are they kidding?it wouldn't down load and when I called for help,well there went 2 hours o frustration. finally I gave up and fortunatly amazon took it back,refunded my money even for the return postage.this is one terrible product and I do not recommend it to anyone."
2,Windows Plus!,This software didn't quite do what I expected. I was somewhat disappointed when I discovered that it wouldn't convert iTunes m4p music files to MP3 files to run on a REAL Player.
3,"Pretty good, but didn't knock my socks off!","The screen savers are cool, I love trying to pretend I'm snorkeling instead of working at my desk. I had high expectations for this product, and I am happy with it, but I was hoping it would be ""dazzling."" I'm content with it, and I'm glad I got it, I just have to remember not everything lives up to my expectations. I would recommend it to friends who have a few extra bucks laying around to spend on frivolous stuff :-)."
4,Great Product,"This product is great, however it does not give you appealing template especially in creating CD lables."
1,No Help At All,I purchased this specifically to transfer my record albums to cds. It was much more complicated than expected and the results were disappointing. It did not break tracks automatically. The sound is hallow after recording. I'm told I need to buy an equalizer now!The cd label maker was wimpy. I ended up buying the Memorex CD/DVD Compact LabelMaker System. It gives me so many more options.AND THERE IS NO WARRANTY!I should have read these reviews before I jumped into buying this. The other stuff doesn't add anything of value to Windows that I don't already have.Save your money.
3,The media version installed but not the Microsoft Plus first CD.,I got this for both Microsoft Plus! For the games and for the Media CD too.I have Windows XP Pro 64bit edition.I put in disc one (Microsoft Plus!) and it did not install any of the theme items or the games that I wanted.I put in the Disc 2 (The Media disc) and it installed fine.So what gives?Only 1 thing will install on my computer what a waste if I would have known that I would have just got the Media edition CD >:(
1,Not Needed,I found that I threw good money after bad. Windows XP has all of the screen savers that were on the program.
3,Why do we have to pay for this stuff?,"This software is interesting and fun. We got it so that we could have the aquarium screensaver legitimately rather than the hot copy I used to have back in the day.Well, I paid for the software and installed it without incident. The aquarium has just a couple of fish. If you want more and prettier fish you have to pay EVEN MORE! Forget it!I like the little dancers that you get with it too though they do take up a considerable chunk of my hard drive. My daughters think it's funny that they come out and dance whenever music starts up.The other features provide negligible benefit to the buyer. Unless you are just okay with paying $20 for three fish on your screen don't buy this software."
3,Where's the rest of the content?,"Wow! I just shelled out a lot and got jipped! I was expecting a book(at least)of the lyrics and original photo artwork! I actually have to keep my original CD's! So, basically I bought this set for the bonus tracks! Also, the live Tokyo stuff from the first ""EP"" sounds like it was taken straight from the old video! Sound quality lacks. Remasterered? I have been a fan of Queensryche from the EP. I had all the records (until CD came out) then bought the CD versions, now I figured this package would be the best AND most economical way to go. I wished I had followed my first thought and bought them individual! QUEENSRYCHE fans, don't do what I did! They should have called this set ""No Photo's or Lyrics Included!"""
3,Suprise,"I won't say anything about the music, as with queensryche, you know that it's quallity you get. I just want to tell what you DON'T get, namely a booklet with lyrics for each album, no pictures or sleevenotes, and the discs themselves aren't in hard cases.Also the box, a ""sweet"" little thing the size of 3 cd hardcovers side by side and the ""artwork"" on the whole package sucks. Really, just buy the individual discs!"
4,Must Have,This contains the core of queensryche music. I only rated it 4 because the game that comes with it is boring ( not a fan of Myst type games) Overall this is a must have collection.
3,Rock fans will be disappointed,"This is a blues recording with a singer who sounds just like Sonny Boy Williamson, and might be him. And as such, it's not bad, and considerably cheaper than ""The Essential Sonny Boy Williamson"". There are no liner notes, so it's impossible to know who plays or sings what. The drop-in card lists ""Dressed to Kill"" as the label. This is disc two of the cheap ""Clapton, Page, and Beck"" 3-CD set."
3,Same old Stephanie Plum,"Stephanie Plum is out of her element again, by getting involved with murder, mobsters, a FTA who likes to run over and mangle woman, cars being destroyed and Gradma Mazur moving in with her and the constant sexual tension between Morelli and Ranger. Now Plum has to retrieve, and pick up no other than Ranger! Being questioned for murder. And now she has a dog, ""Bob"" that is her partner in crime. I found it an amusing book but not one of my favories. It's like watching slap stick now. I feel like the stories and antics are getting tedious. I felt Bob was the highlight of the story."
4,Oh Stephanie!,"Ranger or Joe? Ranger or Joe? The dilemma for Stephanie continues in this the latest Stephanie Plum mystery. I love that Grandma and Lula are back. And I love that a new pet has been added, Bob the dog. Perfect addition for our hapless bounty hunter protagonist.The story itself seemed a bit thin compared to previous books but was still enjoyable. I would like to have more details, details, details!"
3,Hot Six,"It is exactly what you would expect from a Stephanie Plum novel. Not great, but a good easy, entertaining read"
3,It's okay,"The series doesn't really grow. Each book is similar and I grew tired of the lack of character development. Plum is as naive and foolish in the 6th book as in the 1st. I abandoned the series after book 7. The series is very light reading, so if you're just looking for something to take on the plane or to the pool, this will work."
5,So much fun!,Best when read in order. Stephanie gets into so much trouble by accident - no matter how she tries to be professional! Can't put the books down!
5,Evanovich scores again!,"Once again Evanovich has written a story you won't want to put down. The characters she's already created with such unforgettable personality (wouldn't you just love to meet Lula?) are back, along with several new ones--each with enough idiosyncracies to keep you laughing when you're not holding your breath to see how Stephanie gets out of the next tight situation.Although it isn't essential that you read all six of her books in order, you'll enjoy them even more if you do--and following Stephanie Plum's romantic ups and downs is definitely a part of the fun of the ride. Enjoy!"
4,Fast and Funny,"This is my first Janet Evanovich book but not my last. Pure screwball fun, if over the top. If you can completely suspend your disbelief, it's worth taking a trip into Stephanie's universe."
5,Fantastic!,"I waited with baited breath for Evanovich's Hot Six to come out this past June. My wait was not in vain. The book was truly a hit. I am generally a slow reader, but I could not put this Stephanie Plum novel down. Evanovich is able to mix humor and suspense and come out with a novel that is entertaining without being too real-life. I found myself laughing out loud several times while reading the book. The characters seem to come alive from the pages. It makes you wish you were the one asleep on the couch when Ranger comes in for one of the many nightly visits. I recommend it to all who love humor, suspense and just the right amount of sexual tension. A book that makes you want more!"
3,Definitely not her best.,"In the past three weeks I have read all the Stephanie Plum books. At the end of each one I eagerly grabbed the next. Not so with the sixth (which is a good thing, I guess, since the seventh won't be out for quite a while). It is funny and the characters and some of the scenes are memorable, but it just doesn't have the fire that the previous books did. One problem is that the three main characters seem so watered down. Morelli and Ranger have lost the element of sexy surprise they had in the previous books. Stephanie's reactions to the crazy and dangerous things that happen through the story are oddly subdued. However, you will probably get a big kick out of the book. I read it in an evening and will certainly read the next when it comes out. It just isn't as good as the others, which I thought were great fun."
4,"Sexy and hilarious, Evanovich delivers again with Hot Six!","It was a supreme act of self-control to wait for the paperback to be released, considering how much I love this series. I had placed an advance order for the paperback here on amazon and was thrilled when it took me by surprise by arriving on my doorstep one day last week. In one horrible night of insomnia this week, I read over half of the book and finished it. There could have been no more perfect book to get me through this frustrating night of no sleep...I laid in bed laughing out loud and shaking my head at Stephanie, Lula and Grandma Mazur's antics. The ""sexy stuff"" with Stephanie/Morelli/Ranger was the whipped cream and cherry on top of an already delectable sundae. Now I have to see if I can hold off until Seven Up is in paperback!! ARGH!!! :)"
5,Laughing Out Loud,"Stephanie Plum does it again. This unique bounty hunter gets her men with such a sense of fun, humor and wit, you can't help laughing along with her. Hot Six presents a mystery within a light-hearted read that will keep you chuckling, especially at the antics of Grandma Mazur. I thoroughly recommend this latest of the Stephanie Plum series."
5,"Hot Six (Stephanie Plum, No. 6)",I purchased the book for a good friend and she's enjoying the book.The service I recieved was great and the book arrived promptly.
4,Another Fun Romp,I really love these characters and Janet Evonovich does a great job of mixing comedy and suspense. I wanna be Stephanie Plum!
4,Enjoyable as ever,"Like the other Stephanie Plum novels: very funny, raunchy, difficult to put down. I like the way the characters reappear in the series, esp. grandma Mazur. Looking forward to the next book."
5,AND I thought I had problems....,"Newest adventures of Stepanie Plum would make even the strongest women break down,,, but our Ms. Plum. Wacky, fun, witty ,fast paced.. all those things we expect from J.E's books & more. I thought I had ""interesting"" relatives,she has to deal with her grandmother from H**L and at least my live in dog in fully house trained. Tying up the straggling ends of the last book(men), BUT giving us a new ones at the end of this one. Does she think we won't be back for more? With this great series, Nah..."
3,Not her best work,"I was disappointed in this book and felt that Janet was just going through the motions to meet her deadline. There were scenes that served no purpose and some things were resolved too neatly to be believed.I still get a kick out of reading about Stephanie, Ranger, and Morelli, but this wasn't one of their best outings. I wish Janet would use Lulu and Joyce Barnhardt more. After all, why have such good friends and enemies if you aren't going to use them?While I was happy to see who had been standing at the door from the end of book five, I was not at all happy with how this one ended. Sort of takes some of the fun out of the series.This is still a good read, but not worth the price of a hardcover. I'm hoping that book seven will be on the same level as the first five."
2,"""Slowly Running Out of Steam""!","Sorry, but of the sixth book in the continuing saga of Stephanie Plum plus family, animals, cohorts and criminals, it seems to me Evanovich is running out of steam. To me, there was too much superfluous dialogue and some rather unrealistic situations. There, also, seemed to be a strain on silliness in an effort to make the situation humorous. Her first couple of books were super reading, for me, but they have steadily gone downhill in content & intent making it a rather tiresome ""read"". It appears she may have rushed to get this book out and in the haste lost something in the process."
5,Hot Six? You Betcha!,"Once again, I read Evanavich's book so fast that I will have to twiddle my thumbs for a year to get my hands on the next one! Read them in order, read this one alone, but READ THIS SERIES if you love your heroine to be just as confused about life as the rest of us are! Stephanie deals with it all in this book -- a gorgeous cop, a mysterious ""friend"", two of the three stooges following her, a trekkie convention, a grandmother with no license...but a red corvette, a DOG and a HAMSTER! Throw in her buddies at the Bail Bond business, another car disastor or two, and a friend to talk down off a bridge and you have HOT SIX! It's a great read! My advice is to go to the library, the bookstore, get online, and get the first five books! Read them in or out of order --- you won't be able to NOT read all of Stephanie Plum's adventures and you won't be sorry!"
2,NOT THE SAME...,"I could not wait for the new book...well, I must be honest and say, it is not as good as previous books. There are very funny moments but it seem that Janet Evanovich is trying to make every moment funny, which gets boring after a while.I will still buy # seven, but PLEASE Janet add more substance!"
5,Laugh a minute or at least a page,"My wife has read all of Evanovich's books to date,listening to her laugh her way through I decided I must be missing something. I found it great,having owned a business during the 70's in Hamtramck Michigan I found many of her characters to be closer to fact than fiction. I have known many personalities that she discribes. I am sure she has led a close life to her stories to write so well on them. I plan to read more of her books in the future, I have no doubt they will be better than the first,and it was outstanding."
5,HOT SIX IS HOT STUFF!!!!!,"Hot Six will leave you wanting more as the first five did. Should read these in order as you will understand them better. Stephanie Plum bring in Ranger, in your dreams. Ranger is suspected of murder. Murder of one of the local hoods. Ranger is really using Stehanie to help him find out who did kill Homer Ramos. The book is very funny in places. With Grandma and Lulu there is not a dull moment. Ranger is always great, Joe Morelli is his usual very good self. The two men who are following Stephanie are fantastic. Their experience with Bob, the dog, is great. A very good funny mystery. Be glad to get number seven."
4,Great service!,I received my book in a timely matter and the book was in exellant conditon! I will go back!
4,Stephanie Plum's Adventures Continue,"Although the narrative of the lastest Stephanie Plum book, Hot Six, lacks some of the mystery element of previous volumes, the strong characterizations make it a worthwhile reading. The previous book ended in a cliffhanger regarding Stephanie's romantic decision between Joe Morelli and Ranger, and the reder of Hot Six doesn't have to wait long before discovering who Ms. Plum has chosen. Both Joe and Ranger figure prominently in this book, as does the usual cast of characters, particularly Stephanie's grandmother (who is sharper, and hipper than usually portrayed).The local flavor of central New Jersey, and the humorous detours Ms. Evanovich takes the reader on, make Hot Six an enjoyable read. Ms. Evanovich makes the reader cares for the characters, and the characters' actions and reactions to the surrounding drama makes the novel fly along at a rapid pace."
5,Great Characters,"I enjoy the relationships between all of the characters. The story lines are fun to read. I find myself laughing out loud at the interplay between grandma Mazur and everyone. I can just see my mother saying and doing all the things she does. I truly enjoyed this as well as all of the other Stephanie Plumb ""thrillers""."
4,Great Series,"Fun to read Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. Love the characters, and the situations Stephanie gets into. Ms. Evanovich's writings make me laugh out loud."
3,A disappointment,"Ordinarily, I get a kick out of Evanovichs' Stephanie Plum novels--they are great for a quick fun read. Evanovich's HOT SIX, however, may have taken a good thing too far. The zany characters--especially Grandma and the car disasters--continue to evoke laugh-out-loud laughter in a couple of places, but something falls short in this sixth escapade. Morelli on the fringe does not cut it, nor does the weak plot around Ranger. Somehow the Ranger/Stephanie combo just didn't set right with me. Lagging zip in the story was all to evident; hope the next one is better."
5,The Stephanie saga continues...,"Great job Janet! Looked forward to the release of Hot Six for months now. Stephanie Plum's daily routine of adventure is a hoot...you just gotta laugh. Right from the first chapter, Stephanie seems to be in over her head. Simultaneously juggling a search for Ranger, her relationship with Morelli and adjusting to Grandma as her new roommate keeps things lively to say the least. Couldn't put in down, read it in one sitting. Enjoy!"
5,Stephanie is PLUM fantastic!,"I've been looking forward to this release since I finished ""High Five"" and it proved to be just the pick-me-up I needed. Laughter truely is ""the best medicine"" and Stephanie's escapades with Lula, Ranger, Morelli, Grandma and now, Bob the dog got my endorphines flowing with all the laughter I experienced. Of course, I got a few stares from strangers who passed me while I was laughing but who cares, it was a wonderful book and I'm going to re-read books 3 through 5 (I read 1 & 2 again earlier in the year)."
5,Janet Evanovich does it again !,"Stephanie Plum is back and hip deep trouble. Ranger's on the run and wanted for murder, and trusts in Stephanie's less than polished skills to help. Morelli is acually on his side too, making Stephanie's love life quite a bit more complicated. And all of this while Grandma Mazur has moved in. Oh, and she gets a dog. Evanovich's fast paced style and laugh out loud humor makes this a great book- the sexiest Sephanie Plum yet. I can't wait for the next one!"
2,annoying,"After reading all the great customer reviews I decided to try out the Stephanie Plum series. I have to say the book was disappointing. There is very little mystery, the author tries way to hard to be funny and the main character is annoying. An easy read with a few laughs but not much substance. Really shouldn't be listed in the mystery genre."
3,Mix one part Sue Grafton and one part Patricia Cornwell,"An easy read but the beach season is over. The main character is a mixture of Kinsey Millhone (Sue Grafton) and Kay Scarpetta (Patricia Cornwell), you are better off reading a book about each.The subplots are entertaining and help distract you from the main plot which is silly. Many of the characters seem like ""caricatures"", not real people. For example, the two goons following her and ""the Dealer"" Wait for next summer then buy the paperback."
1,Sparkle Hayter is Better & Funnier !!!!,"I finally got around to reading Evanovich. My expectations were high, probably because her books are always on the best seller lists and are always checked out at my local library. I was amazed to discover what juvenile and boring drivel her work is. For those who have convinced themselves they like Evanovich I recommend they try Sparkle Hayter's Robin Hudson novels which are 100% better than any Evanovich. The titles to look for are:What's A Girl Gotta Do?, Nice Girls Finish Last, The Last Manly Man, Revenge of the Cootie Girls, and The Chelsea Girl Murders."
1,total fluff,"After being told I simply had to try this author, it was severely disappointed. I thought it was going to be a tightly-written thriller. Instead I got a book that when it was amusing, was in a juvenile sort of way, and utterly lacking in suspense. I was also appalled at the way that killing, rape and setting people on fire was dealt with as if it were amusing, when sadly, there are a lot of crimes out there comitted like sickos like that, and it is anything but funny for the families. In fact, as I write this, I wonder at myself for being 'entertained' by stories of sick criminal types. they certainly abound in this book, though entertained is not what I felt. more like offended and disgusted. A light weight bit of fluff that deserves mass market at best, certainly not hardcover."
1,A LAUGH EVERY 100 PAGES,"Evanovich writes with a cookie cutter instead of a PC keyboard.This novel is so formulaic you'll go back to see if it's already in your collection.You may smile or slightly chuckle at a turn of a phrase--but that occurs about every 100 pages. And the book is about 300 pages, so the math is evident.Evanovich has sniffed at reviewers who've questioned whether she is just churning this stuff out on auto-pilot. The paragraphs seem like they are produced the way a butcher shoves sausage through a grinder.And grind is a perfect word for Hot Six."
1,1 star is FAR too Generous,"This volume is an inadequate attempt to propagate the author's own personal dogma. The personal angst and conflicts of the writer are palpable in every sorry sentence, and she seems to believe in the ""infalibility"" of her own judgements. The selfish motivations of the author should never be so patently present that the reader is uncomfortable in witnessing the internal strife of the writer. In short, only this can be said: what this book's prose lacks in skillfulness or scholarly fact it makes up in shallowness and craven rhetoric. Bother with this book only to your own inconvenience."
5,She's Still Got It !,I would really love to meet Janet Evanovich. She must have one heck of a sense of humor! The newest Stephanie Plum novel is just as funny and witty as the previous five were. All the charactors we have come to know and love are there. I cannot wait until number seven. What on earth will Steph think of next and her love life could not get anymore complicated. Keep up the good work Ms. Evanovich and write faster.
3,seven days of reading and sleeping,"the entire book was on and off again for my reading due to my job so i would work, read, then sleep , i guess you could say that this book just happens to be one of lifes little pleasures. it makes you realize that yes indeed things could always be more complicated in your own life. worth a try."
4,What an imaginative suspense writer!,"Janet Evanovich's series with Steph Plum just keeps getting more and more hilarious and fun! Janet has the ability to draw characters like few other suspense thriller writers of her genre. I particularly enjoy the fact that they don't have perfect hair or leap over tall buildings in a single bound, but instead they find themselves in ridiculous situations that bring them the humanity and commonality that is so frequently missing in suspense novels. There is none of the perfect chisled characters who are wise beyond belief. But instead, we get Plum, her granny, her sexual desires, her cousin Vinnie, and failed attempts that make for great reading escapes and enjoyable entertainment. Be careful not to read this one in a public place because you'll find yourself bursting out loud with laughter and either someone will wrestle it away from you or they'll clear extra space for you. Who cares! Enjoy this ""hot"" sexy read and then get on to the next one."
4,I cannot resist!,"In my review of 'Three to Get Deadly' I said that things were repeating themselves within the series and that Evanovich needed to do something new to spice things up. After reading 'Hot Six' I still see overlapping material, but this book is just too laugh-out-loud funny and incredibly hot to put down!In the sixth instalment of the Stephanie Plum series, Plum has been assigned to track down her mentor, Ranger. She knows her skills could never bring him in and even if she did by luck, Plum doubts that she could turn him over to the authorities. In the meantime, Grandma Mazur has moved in with Stephanie which puts a dent in her lovelife with Joe Morelli. And there's new characters, including a dog nobody wants to keep and a stoner Mooner and his trekie friend Dougie who have some excellent prat-fall scenes. Thank you Evanovich for livening up the series! I can't wait for the seventh instalment to be published in paperback!"
5,Hot Six is Smoking!,"I enjoyed Hot Six the most of all of this series! All of the Stephaine Plum books are good. I found myself cracking up with laughter several times during this book! I was reading it on break at work and I forgot that I was not at home and would fall out laughting. My co-workers enjoyed my reading the book also, as they got a kick out of me outburst! I can't wait for number Seven to come out!!"
4,HOT SIX,Janet comes thru again with her NJ wit and her knowledge of the state.The story she tells keeps you guessing on Who Did It.
3,This One Did Not Capture Me,"It seems as if only every other book in this series capture my attention. But at least we do know who was knocking on Stephanie's door.In this sixth outing, Stephanie is hot on the trail of a guy that killed his wife and has a general dislike for all woman; and since Stephanie does seem to be of the girl variety, this makes for quite an interesting adventure. If only Ranger was available, but unfortunately Ranger has a couple problems of his own. Most importantly, Ranger has skipped on his own bail and now has two amateurs looking for him in addition to the infamous Joyce.This comedy of errors only intensifies when Grandma Mazur decides to move in with Stephanie and Ranger makes a surprise visit."
4,Another solid effort,"This sixth entry into the Stephanie Plum series is another strong effort. She and Lula continue to make you laugh out loud as they go about their bounty hunting ways. The bad guys are just as zany and Grandma retains her charm. While this is a strong entry, it may lag just a tad behind the earlier books. Still, it's light years ahead of most of your other choices for fun reading material."
3,Stephanie' tries again,"I first discovered Stephanie and her crazy friends and family in book eleven and fell in love. When I realized it was part of a series I broke open my piggy bank to get the rest of them. I just finished ""Hot Six"" and while the charecters aren't as full out nutty as they become by book eleven, they are developing very nicely. The fixes Steph gets into are pretty predictable in ""Six"" but good fun none-the-less. Steph is fun to hang out with on a warm summer day at the beach or a cold winter evening in front of a fire. My piggy bank gave up it's contents for a smart investment."
5,Loved it,This is the best book I have read all year. I read it in a day. Janet didn't disapoint. Stephanie and Grandma are still going strong. My only problem is that I read it too quickly and have to wait for the next book for more.
4,Enjoyable,I purchased this book because of the cliff hanger in High Five. I needed to know if she picked Ranger or Morelli. I didn't think this was quite as good as High Five but still found it enjoyable. The character Stephanie Plum is likable and extremely funny.
5,What a riot!,"These get funnier and funnier, each time you wonder how much more trouble can one person get into....then poor ""Stephanie plum"" to the rescue...lol!"
3,"Evanovich's ""Hot Six""","Not my favorite of the series. The individual parts were funny (Bob the dog, Grandma's relocation, Joyce's misadventures) and I liked the tension between Ranger and Stephanie, but overall it felt flat."
4,"Funny, witty, easy to read","Once you start, you can't stop, entertaining, keeps you coming back for more. Great travel companions. Can't wait to read the next..."
5,I love Stephanie Plum,"Janet Evanovich just keeps getting better and better....and Stephanie Plum keeps getting luckier and luckier. Stephanie's bounty hunting skills haven't improved, she keeps picking up the strangest people (she has a knack for finding them), and yet she still escapes with merely a flesh wound. All through it we have Gramma Mazur, God love her, moving in with Stephanie, Rex, and a compulsively-overeating dog. Gramma is also trying to get her driver's license--and who's that old man in her back seat? Not to mention a double dose of Tall dark and handsome-Ranger and Morrelli-our favorite Trenton studs. Evanovich leaves us with another cliffhanger, and leaves us to wonder what is next for our favorite spandex clad big haired bounty hunter. Evanovich is on fire with Hot Six!"
2,Too short - Series going Downhill,"I was disappointed in this book. Sure I got a few laughs, and it was an entertaining way to spend 3 or 4 hours - but it is another step down as far as I'm concerned in a series that started out great.It was way too short (lots of white space and a big font made it appear to be a normal sized novel). As well, the plot was too easy. It seems like Janet Evanovich is counting on putting in a laugh here and there, and hoping that will be enough. Well, in my opinion - it's not.Needs more plot development. I hope the next one is better, or I am finished with this series."
5,Evanovich Does It Again,"I'll admit that I don't have the most sophisticated tastes, but I know what I like. And what I like is Stephanie Plum and her whole crazy, funny world and its inhabitants. This book resolved the cliffhanger from ""High Five"" and jumped right into Stephanie's current (and ever present troubles). The characters we all love are back, plus some new folks liven things up a bit. It is interesting to watch Stephanie evolve - she is gradually gaining confidence in her skills. I read this book in 24 hours and now I have a loooooong time to wait for the next one. But I'm sure that book number seven will be worth the wait."
5,Do yourself a favor - READ IT!,"If you don't pick up another book this year, grab this one. I just finished ""Hot Six"" and I'm still smiling. Last year I was furious when I finished ""High Five"" and realized I would have to wait for this book to find out who was knocking at Stephanie's door. It was so much worse than waiting to find out who shot J.R. Ewing! But the wait proved worthwhile. I took the book with me to get my hair done this morning and really did embarrass myself as I couldn't stop laughing out loud. As usual, Janet Evanovich manages to keep her story moving at a brisk pace and keep us up to date with all of our favorite Trenton residents. (Knowing Grandma Mazur is driving is one really good reason to stay out of Trenton though. Especially when you know she's always packing!) I don't want to give away anything, but Janet, could you please hurry up with Book Seven? Give up those book signing tours, just keep writing! Damn skippy!"
2,Just like all the others,"Ok, I know we read these books because of their entertainment value. But, please! The woman is stupid and would have been fired from McDonalds (or anywhere else) in 24 hours. She has a gun and is afraid to use it because she might shoot someone?! But she is around the dregs of humanity who would shoot her without thinking twice about it. She is afraid of the people she has to apprehend...who would want a job that you were afraid of. I enjoyed the first one but this woman would get on my nerves after a while."
3,"It IS funny, but....",I would have enjoyed a little bit of a mystery/plot as well. Everything just resolves itself as Stephanie bumbles about. The book needs a better framework to support the delightful fluff.
2,HOT SIX BY JANET EVANOVICH,SAME BASIC FORMAT AS PREVIOUS NOVELS. TORN BETWEEN TWO LOVERS.A FEW LAUGHS ALONG THE WAY.
5,Great fun,I absolutely love Janet Evanovich way of writing. She has an amazing gift of brilliantly mixing humor and action. I have all her Stephanie Plum novels and I am really looking forward to getting the next one.
2,Hot Six by Janet Evanovich,"I was very disappointed with this book. I didn't agree with Stephanie's choice of men because I was rooting for the other guy, but that's just a matter of choice.However, what really disappointed me was that this book didn't have any depth. It feels like an installment or chapter that was rushed out to the public in order to answer the burning question at the end of High Five and to be a bridge to the 7th installment.As in the rest of the series, parts of this book are laugh out loud funny; once again Grandma Mazur and Lula are hysterical, and I love Bob; but a couple of funny scenes don't make a book. For me Hot Six didn't really advance the series, once the ""which man was it"" question is cleared up (and that's only given 2 pages), we're really no further into Stephanie's life than we were before."
3,Too short!,"As a longtime Stephanie Plum/Janet Evanovich fan I must admit to disappointment with Hot Six. Yes, it was a relief to know who removed Stephanie's sexy black dress at the end of High Five, but that's not enough to make up for the fact that the book is less than 300 pages and has (in my opinion) large-ish typeface and wide margins.That aside, it was the usual hilarious ride, including yet another car destroyed and the reappearance of the big blue Buick."
2,funny but....,"I enjoyed reading this and have to admit to laughing out loud at some parts, however it could be just as funny without the bad language. I have a 13 year old that loves to read and I cannot let him read this due to the continous bad language. The book is sillier than her others too, therefore, based on these two things, I probably won't buy her next book - instead rent it from the library and if the language is still offensive, I probably won't be reading her anymore.."
4,The stories get better and better....,"In Hot Six, the next installment of S.Plum, the story is enjoyable and strong. Thank goodness who said ""Drop the Dress"" was resolved immediately. The two men in her life and stilling buzzing around her. It must be tough! Actually I thought there was too little ""action"" for our Miss Stephanie. Let's pump up the ""action"" volume for the next installment!"
5,A Real Laugher!,"Hot Six is the best in the series (so far!). The cliffhanger ends right at the start - I am not telling and goes into one after another. There is a particular part that I laughed out (louder than others) and it has to do with a drive-up window. I am already waiting for #7 - be sure to enter the ""name number 7"" book on Ms. Evanovich's website! Fun, fun and more fun!"
5,"Hot six, Stephanie Plum series","All this series are very intertaining. Funny and witty, just the way I like life to be. Just when you think you know what will happen, she does something out of the blue and throws you off guard again. They need to make movies or at least a series about all of them."
2,I wish I bought a Graco,"I registered for this PNP b/c it had gotten fairly good reviews and it matched my stroller. My daughter is 8 weeks old and I will not put her in the bassinet to nap during the day b/c it is very flimsy and does not provide a firm surface for her to sleep on. She is easily startled and wakes up immediately every time she moves in it. Also, the velcro tabs that hold it in place are close to the end and it is difficult to get a sheet around it for this reason."
1,Do your research,"My wife and I kindly received this PNP as a gift at the baby shower. We used it 3x and now the locking mechanism will no longer lock. We, like so many can't do anything about it since it is past the 90 day warrentee. Play the extra $20 and get a better product, it isn't worth the frustration with a new baby. Now we are stuck with it until I can figure out if I can fix it, since there is no help from Evenflo."
4,So Good So Far,"Because we are buying items in advance for our baby, we have not been able to use this with an actual child. However, we did put it up when we received the item and it is really cute. It took us awhile to figure out where everything goes (the instructions are not the best), but we did manage to get the job done. I did not give it a 5 as it is pretty heavy, even when compacted. Additionally, the changing station does not go into the bag when packed up so it is just hanging out. It seems to be pretty practical and very sturdy. We are hoping that it all works out for us and our baby!"
3,I would pay more for a different playard.,"When I registered for this, I was clueless about what features I would need. I just picked it based on price. Now that I have a 7 month old, I wish I would have picked one with different features because we use our playard everyday. I have not had any problems putting it together. Here are the things I would change:1. The velcro that holds the bottom down is too close to the edges, and makes it difficult to put a sheet on. The sheet keeps flipping off.2. I would get one that has mesh on all 4 sides to make it easier to see your child. This one has mesh on 3 sides, and one side is blocked with the diaper/toy compartments. Other playards have a separate attachment for diapers, etc."
2,"1st time shame on me, 2nd time shame on you","I received this playard as a baby shower gift and fell in love with its features. It was pretty easy to put together, however when I packed it up the first time and tried to put it back together- none of the sides would lock into place. After several tries I called Evenflo, who walked me through a few troubleshooting steps and the sides still would not lock into place. They agreed to send me another playard.I received my new playard a week later and the same problem happened again. Based on my personal experience I will never buy this brand again!!!"
4,Love it!!!,"I bought this playard because it matched my stroller. I used it even before my baby was born to put my nephew in when he spent the night. It is pretty easy to put up and take down. The only thing is that it is quite heavy, but I can deal with that. Other than that, I love it."
1,Base Broke after one use,"I love the several different functions of this playard. But when I returned to work after my son was three months old and we took it down for the first time to take to grandma's house, the base of it broke and will not lock back into place. There is only a 90 day warranty on it, so I can not return or exchange it."
5,I use this product every day.,I use this product every day. I consider it to be a necessity for me. I highly recommend it to others.
2,"Was bad, got returned","The meter was Dead On Arrival. Disappointed and surprised that anyone would try to sell an obviously broken piece of worthless junk, very dirty and scuffed up and no signs of life.However, I DID GET MY MONEY BACK a couple of weeks after I returned it, so it was a marginally adequate transaction."
1,Are you serious?,"Ten bucks for a 1700 word download? I love Scarlett Thomas but I would suggest you try out her website for lots of interviews, reviews and such for free."
5,Excellent Docudrama Concerning the AV 1611,Even if you don't view the King James Bible as the word of God this is still an excellent and well made docudrama for those interested in the history one of the most important pieces of literature in Western Civilization. Beautifully filmed on location in Scotland and England and presented by the magnificent voice actor John Rhys-Davies.
5,Documentary Drama on King James and his bible,"This is an excellant production that bridges between a documentary and a drama. The narrator covers the history with location filming and then this is interspersed with acted, drama of the events. It paints a vidid and engrossing picture that makes for easy but valuable bible information. The video does what it says and tells the story of how the King James bible came into being by following the political termoils of James, his life and ambitions."
5,Very good documentary!,Makes the birth of the King James Bible come alive. I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in church history or history in general.
2,The item was skipping,I couldnt watch it it was skipping. It got stuck and wouldnt play. It gives the story of how the KJV got started.
1,is it worth it,"I did not care for this movie, if I wanted to read the bible, that would cost me nothing. And if I wanted to own the bible, I could own it for free. So, why pay for it, reading cost nothing but your time and eyesight, the DVD does not disclose anything more than you can find out for yourself!"
5,"Excellent: respectful, admiring without hagiography","Excellent scholarship and acting; well-crafted; a wonderful example of how to convey greatness without sentimentality or hagiography. I was prepared to be bored, but I was unexpectedly moved."
4,Excellent documentary on James I,KJB - The Book that Changed the World is an entertaining documentary/Docudrama that mostly focuses on the life and reign of James VI (Scotland) / I (England/UK) that shows off his sheer ability as a mediator and monarch with his great project: an universal bible acceptable by all the religious factions in his realm. The main flaw of this documentary is that the presumed subject - the creation of the King James Bible - takes a backseat to looking at the life and motivations of King James I.
5,Good video,"This is a good production of a very complex story regarding the development of the King James Bible. It's more modern than some other attempts, and quite good for study groups to use over a period of weeks. Entertaining and enlightening."
4,Mostly political history,"Focuses mostly on King James and his life, but it was very good and very well done! Thank you for letting us see it!"
3,Good info in a compact space,"Didn't feel too impressed with this little book when it first arrived but did use it right away for a camping trip to Bahia Honda State Park in the Florida Keys. The info helped me to choose the best camp site of the three different areas availale at this Park and to see this park to the fullest. I also read about and visited two other parks in the Keys area to explore them for future trips. After my first trip I felt as though I had gotten my monies worth, and enjoyed the trip more fully because of this book.I have scheduled a second trip for next week for NE Florida through this book.."
5,Joy!,"Yuki is a wonderful up-and-coming artist in Japan. She has a very sweet voice, and her songs are very lively. =) Even if you've never seen what she looks like, her voice says is all;young, talented, enegetic, and ready to go!I recomend Yuki strongly."
2,horrible stay away from this film with no heart.,"What the hell happened after the first film was good. This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen,but the entire cast just seems to be going through the motions. The heart of the first film is just really missing. I hate how they replaced the original actors of half dead and seldom seen with dudes I didn't care about. This film could have been so much better."
5,The perfect first book!,"Our 3 month old daughter can spend 10-15 minutes on my lap looking at this book with me; she coos, smiles and stares about the page with wonder as I point out the different shapes and objects. People do say that she has a great attention span for such a young baby, but I think any several month old would take to this book. This is a must have. It teaches shapes, colors, location, size, opposites and clothing."
2,More old-fashioned than appears,"When I was looking for a possible baby book for our daughter I was attracted to this one because of the reviews: ""hip,"" ""funky,"" ""unique,"" and definitely not ""dowdy"" or ""old-fashioned."" While the book IS stylish, I wish someone had written that it does have an old-fashioned approach to the idea of what makes a family. Many sections are headed for ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy."" So if you are looking for a true alternative baby book that makes no assumptions about the make-up of your family--whether it's single parent, two moms, two dads, etc.--this one is not for you."
3,"Nice design, but ...","The book is modern, clean, minimalist and elegant. While I liked the space for Dads to write, I didn't like that it had so many lines for each section. The book is very free-form. Great if you're used to journaling, not so great if you don't write regularly on the topics of family and memories."
3,Right By My Side,"The novel Right By My Side, by David Haynes is an insightful piece of work with a believable protagonist that must cope with believable problems. This book should be read by any adolescent who is experiencing divorce or has a difficult family life. The novel is one most people could relate to, but I don't recomend it for those who like a challenge. It's straight foward (and perhaps offensive dialect) is honest and gives the novel its edge to reality. A simple, yet pleasant read."
4,This book is entertaining and easy to read.,"David Haynes is a delightfully witty writer. Also check out his other work, including ""Somebody Else's Mamma"" and ""Live at Five""."
3,Distinguished Series and Artists; Undistinguished Recording,"I hope that Mr. Kochkin won't mind my quoting him, but I totally agree with his review: ""To the untrained musician these are fine but unmemorable pieces. Don't get me wrong I recommend the whole Hyperion set....it's just with a few exceptions I can't distinguish one from the other. They are good perhaps as background music when reading."" I would only add that the artists on this recording are so very talented, particularly Marc-Andre Hamelin, who does so many things so brilliantly.I had heard that this recording was one of the things that would lead to a revival of interest in the work of both Schwarenka and Rubenstein. I'm only a humble listener (and not a serious musician), but I think not."
3,Tier 2 concertos,To the untrained musician these are fine but unmemorable pieces. Don't get me wrong I recommend the whole Hyperion set....it's just with a few exceptions I can't distinguish one from the other. They are good perhaps as background music when reading.
5,Bettie Brown,"After visiting Ashton Villa in Galveston, October 2003, I decided to learn more about its famous former inhabitant- Bettie Brown. The book was actually suggested to our group as we walked through the old house. The tour whetted my appetite, and when I finally bought the book, I devoured it in one sitting. Bettie lived a fabulous life of luxury, and was a truly modern woman. There are several pictures of Bettie and her family in the book, and of Ashton Villa which is just as important as Bettie herself. The book covers the span of Bettie's life, her family history, a very long family tree, and even the life of the house after Bettie died. The 1900 Galveston storm is a prominent event in Bettie and Ashton Villa's life, and it was very interesting to read about how it affected even the very rich way of life. I recomend this book not only as a peek into Galveston history, but also as a valuable biography of a true Texas woman."
4,Lost & Stolen History,"Basil Davidson's ""revisionist"" history of Africa is stunning, shocking, enlightening and so full of detail that one viewing will not suffice. You will have to view these tapes more than once to digest, comprehend and ultimately be enriched by the information he delivers. Never before have you seen or heard information from a man who, though European, has lived in Africa for most of his adult life. Mr. Davidson uses archeology to uncover the truths behind the myths. ""Africa"" will shatter your conceptions and misconceptions while revealing a glorious and ultimately tragic history. If you have the courage to know truths that will change your view of the world, order these tapes, today!"
5,Love killshot,I was really excited to purchase this film watched the previews couldn't wait to get my hands on it this film was simply awesome
2,"it's a ""beautiful"" movie","well i guess its a must own if your trying to collect all the ""beautiful"" movies. not much action, ok story line, not much nudity. the movie is about a blind hooker that screws and than kills for the yakuza. you can get a fuzzy pause and toss out of it."
4,Very informative,"Mr Goodwin has produced some of the best books available on Nelson's ships and the Trafalgar campaign. This anthology of usual questions about the mighty Victory is very revealing and gives so many facts and statistics that one feels he just visited this floating museum. Here are almost all the questions that a layman or a specialist would like to ask, like the speed of Victory, the kind of armament it had, the three kinds of shots she fired against the enemy, the total length of riggings, full diagrams of her sails, the quantity of oak trees that were used in her construction, the admirals she served under, the number and kinds of anchors it carried, the everyday life details of her crew in war and peace, the food and the sanitary conditions onboard, her famous battles, some secrets of sailing and special maneuvers and a lot more. The only serious drawback is the lack of color photographs but even so the book is highly recommended for everyone interested in the subject."
5,I made the mistake of lending this book to someone...,"...and they hadn't given it back yet. I love how Flint develops the religious conflict in this book and the nature of ""the Question."" A surprisingly insightful read on a basic difference in philosophy between the scientific and the dogmatic, and a nicely alien culture and biology to build it in.Mother of Demons remains to this day my favorite ""serious"" Flint book."
5,This is not just one more formula-type book.,"The situation (humans stranded on an alien planet) could be very stereotyped, but it isn't. The personalities of the individual aliens (within the parameters of their own biology) are developed as clearly as those of the humans. For a change, the humans act with reasonable intelligence."
5,I liked it a lot!!,"This book fired my imagination in a way no other book I have read. For those who have read Robert Asprins, ""Bug Wars."" and enjoyed it this book holds a similar but unique treat."
3,Sci-fi for the Southern Poverty Law Center,"Synopsis: An Indian historian and a Jewish New Yorker get members of several alien tribes to form a diverse ""nation"" of molluscs. Earthlings in the new ""nation"", although fearsome in war, will be spared most military service, which will not be led by the earth demons -- they are so few, and it would be a waste of their talents. The army must be a gukuy(goy) army, as it is a gukuy(goy) ""nation"".The plot and battle scenes are gripping, so it still gets 3 three stars."
5,Foyle's Done it again.,I really enjoy the series. I think the character of Christopher Foyle is very interesting. Poor man would love to be fighting in the war but instead is solving one murder after another.
4,Memories can't die away,Great selection of stories placed on the English coast at the time of the Second World War. Well acted and engaging. We enjoyed watching each of them several times. Very well done without an excessive violence and/or cruelty.
4,One Problem,"We ordered the full set of Foyle's War because it is an excellent series, superbly written and photographed. We were particularly pleased because it claims to have the closed caption feature for the hearing impaired. Sadly, we had to return the set because it does not have closed captioning as advertised. Very disappointing!"
4,Very entertaining - superb insight into wartime culture,"Beautifully photographed series with very good acting. The greatest value to the series for me has been the insights into how a constant condition of war touches and affects every aspect of the ordinary lives of non-combatants. We never stop and think, for example, how casket making becomes a wartime priority, or how valuable junk metals (tin cans) can be.The story lines are always interesting and keep your attention. There is a bit of Deus ex machina when the plot is wrapped up. Foyle usually reveals some critical piece of knowledge that has been withheld from the audience or else something happens that causes everything to fall into place. That said, the plots are interesting, the characters well portrayed and the series well worth watching."
5,"Splendid, impeccable...well worth the dough, mate.","This series was produced by intelligent, thoughtful people for like types. The deep though intelligible script, taut sequencing, convincing acting, and historical research to enable realistic portrayal of aspects of WWII usually overlooked, combine to make this 4-DVD series one of the best purchases I have found on the market. You might guess the culprit ahead of time, but you will thoroughly enjoy, and be engrossed in, the events leading up to the disclosure."
5,FOYLES WAR,"I Got the CD in a reasonable amount of time unbroken, and in tact.it played very well Thanks very much"
5,Entertaining and accurate,"I bought two sets, 1 and 2, and enjoyed them so much I got the whole set of nineteen disks later on. I enjoy the history, learned a little something along with the brilliant entertainment. Highly reccomend this set to anyone to see if they will enjoy the whole series."
5,Good series,"This Series is so beautifully done. We have seen the entire Series, and loved it, so we gave this first set to one of our children for Christmas. Michael Kitchen does such a wonderful job of being in the midst of was, but not actually part of it."
5,Television at its best,"This is a near-perfect television mystery series. Every element is outstanding: the ensemble acting, the plot and character development, the dialog, the set design -- EVERYTHING.How often do you watch a tv show, a mystery at that, and shed tears over the death of a character, or at the sheer poignancy of a situation?Each episode contains a mystery that is solved by the end, but I cared less about the ""who dunnit"" aspect that by the entire story surrounding the mystery. We see what it was like to live in Britain at the start of the war; what it was like to sail off to Dunkirk to help bring the boys back; what people went through to buy food and petrol. It's a history lesson that deals with topics far more fascinating (...). It's the story of people trying to live their lives and do their jobs despite the most horrendous events.Best of all, the show has people you grow to really like and respect: Foyle, Sam and Milner.I can't wait for Series 3 to be aired (...)."
3,Really for men & lesbians,"I buy dvds like this because I workout heavily and are looking for tips on how they get in and stay in such great shape. This information is not given here, but if you like to look at women and don't mind the porn like music. Go for it."
4,Wonderful classroom aide,"Excellent book full of experiments and fun things to do.Floating and Sinking develops the theme of learning with objects, making boats of different shapes, which objects sink or float, as well as cargo carrying boats and various other experiments on the theme.Very thin tome, but excellent nonetheless.Wonderful classroom aide.Ages 3-9 will be interested in the science play.Kotori"
4,"The individual members of the ""Million Dollar Trio""","Interesting and personally satisfying to see and hear these three wonderful musicians. The sound when Heifetz plays the Mendelssohn is not as good as it could be. Otherwise, a good musical experience viewing and hearing these great artists."
2,"In b&w, static picture, sound could be better","This documentary, in black and white, shows the artists playing, but the scenes are relatively static, the quality of sound could be better, and the picture in not much richer than a slightly animated slide show, unless the objective is to see the artist's technique. There is no much advantage of watching this documentary over listening just the music from CD."
3,Sound please!,"Yes, I too agree the main concert's sound is pretty abysmal. I found (in the case of my DVD sound set up)that the Live Passage Tour 1996 in Krakow, Poland show on DVD 2 is much more listenable than the main concert. The bootleg isn't something you can really listen to, unless you've drunk a six-pack or something! Overall, considering the relative cost - if you must have some live Samael the Krakow concert will probably be the main one you listen to."
3,Must try to see it in context.....,"As this is the only chance many of us have to see Samael live, it is a good thing. Unfortunately, the poor recording quality of the audio--even on the ""professionally"" done shows--merges the music into one big giant unlistenable sludge. All you can hear are the drums and between-song banter on the 1994 performance.Considering the quality of the band's music, that is a real shame.The brief interviews with Xytras and Vorphalack (or Xy and Vorph as they like to be called now) in the studio during the ""Passage"" recordings are excellent inclusions, but you've got replay it a few times to decipher their thick accents.No extras here, but who needs them in this case? This is plenty of Samael for the fans, and any dvd by them is a bonus in itself, as far as I'm concerned.Overall, it's great to be able to see them time and time again on this format, but the terrible sound quality will make the luster quickly wear thin."
3,"Pushing Boundaries, but what's the point?","I didn't find out about this album until I heard At The Controls, and fell in love with the only two tracks that of course Holden produced. This album is confusing, in that perhaps a little over a third of the material is finished, with some extras thrown in. I agree with the EP idea, and that these tracks blow me away every time I hear them. Holden has one of the most unique ideas about rhythm and sound and I've always felt that his productions have this new age grooviness to them, like a modern take on retro beats. His arrangements and layout are top notch, the guy just has an ear for good music.I hold the rating back simply because some of the tracks are pointless other than for art's sake."
2,I expected something different,"I used to be a step aerobics fanatic. I am just now progressing from my physical therapy into a more ""normal"" workout regimen after herneating a disk in my lower back last year and thought this video would be a nice compliment to my elliptical workouts. While I thought the lower body workout was solid, I thought the upper body workout was mediocre. And I was disappointed in the abdominal exercises. I thought it was bad form to encourage beginners to hold on to the back of the legs for crunches.Most of all, I would not recommend this workout for anyone who has experienced a major back injury in the past. I followed all of the instructor's directions for beginners and am currently in the most back pain I have experienced since last August."
4,Tough workout at a slightly slower pace,"I have done many, many firm workouts. I really like how this one is broken down so you can do it in sections or the entire workout at one time. You can choose upper body or lower body and go directly to the workout. What I find annoying is the plastered-on smile and constant need to flash cleavage at a predominantly female audience. This particular instructor gives some very helpful tips on proper execution of the movements, but is especially guilty in the annoying display of cleaveage.If those factors don't bother you, you will enjoy the workout."
4,"Good workout, hard on knees","I have three of The Firm's DVDs, and use the fanny lifter and sculpting stick. It's a great workout, but if you have any problems with your knees, stay away from The Firm. The exercises rely heavily on bending the knees and putting a lot of weight and stress on the knee joints. I've been OK with it but have had a little soreness.The upper body exercises of course do not involve the knees and are great. But probably two-thirds of the exercises involve a fair amount of stress on the knee joints."
5,How fun is this series?,"This series is so much fun! Dropping a husband and wife into a survival situation and seeing how they fare, well that's better than marriage counseling! An enthusistic two thumbs up!"
2,dissapointed,I thought this was a dirty movie. Why would you call a movie by this name if its not a dirty movie? I wouldnt put my cigar out on this. If I could still get around like I used to Id make somebody pay.
4,Oh Susanna,I enjoy all of Ms. Gregory's historical fiction. This is not quite as good as the Matthew Bartholomew mysteries but they are still quite good. I am definitely into this series.
5,Restoration London Brought to Life!,"Susanna Gregory has done it again! Intelligence agent Thomas Chaloner embarks on his second dangerous investigation in this authentic period, exceptional mid-17th century mystery. Don't miss this one!"
4,The Violent van Gogh,I found this book very appealing. It touched on both his art and his emotional side. This might of been the happiest time of his life and it was all to breif. I tottaly recomend this book if you enjoy Vincent's works.
5,A great mix,"This album is a great mix of musical styles and really showcases Will's talents. It has rockers, ballads, and a nice spoken word number in Pride. There are some great gems here, my favorites are Life, Grown Up Now, Less Polite, Everyone's In Love, and Enemy. With 17 tracks on the album, there is a lot of favorites there. Will has notes on each song at his website which you should check out. I have not been able to pop this in the player and only listen to it once, everytime it seems to repeat at least halfway before it gets changed. This CD is a must have for any music fan."
3,Nyt cb review,An excellent cookbook however it' lacks in display of finished product presentation. Amazon logistics are nothing short of amazing in getting product to customer.
1,poor condition,This is the first book that I have ordered from Amazon and was truly upset with the condtion of the book when it arrived. Binding was torn and it was in poor condition. I have ordered many books in the past and have been pleased with all.
2,just not good enough...,"i received this cookbook as a gift recently and was eager totest it out....i wasn't impressed really.there are very few directions as to the timing of each step inthe recipes, and the recipes themselves aren't very fresh ormouthwatering...most are very ""classic"" items that seem quitedated, as well as heavy and unhealthful...some directions torecipes are overlooked completely, very confusing for a novice..(which i am not....)i use JOY OF COOKING all the time and will continue to do so, also MADELEINE KAMMAN'S MAKING OF A COOK (an absolute bible!)i do not recommend the NEW YORK TIMES COOKBOOK for any level ofhome cook."
4,Good Every Day Cook Book,"Did you ever find yourself wondering was it 3 minutes for 5 minutes for a softboiled egg? or what should I do with these chicken legs? Well this cook book answers this level of questions, and the answers are easy to find. Sorry if you are looking for fancy recipes with great pictures this isn't it. But for a reference for all the basic recipes this book is top notch, plus I really like the chicken country captain recipe."
1,AWFUL!,"I bought this book because it was supposed to be an updated version of my old New York Times Cookbook. It is not even close! The recipes are different, herbs have been avoided, there is no recipe for Chicken Pot Pie of all things, Gruyere cheese has been changed to Swiss cheese pretty much across the board, quantities hve changed, volumes have changed, cooking times have changed but, the index is better.I strongly recommend against buying this book under any circumstances! Stick with your old one, or go with Julia Child."
5,Family Bible,"I have two children in their 20's. They have been arguing about who will get the ""Family Bible"" aka NY Times Cookbook 1961 Edition!! My edition is stained, torn and duct-tape holds the binding together but it is always my first choice when searching for a recipe. I have considered getting a second copy so my children will each have one...the problem is, who will get Mom's marked up copy with dog-eared pages, recipes with stars and hi-lighting!"
2,returned,"cooking food, to me anyhow, requires some type of picture/s. I can't know the title and/or taste(might sound strange) with just unfamiliar name, which I can't even attempt to try."
3,"Good music, bad soundtrack","George Martin, being the first composer after John Barry to score a Bond film, did a fabulous job for ""Live and Let Die"". Highlight tracks includes Bond Meets Solitaire, Snakes Alive, and Solitaire Gets Her Cards.Unfortunately, many of the cues for the action sequences, which uses the main theme, was left out, as was the gorgeous instrumental (which rivals John Barry's skill in composing romantic themes) used when Bond seduced Solitaire with a deck full of Lovers card. It is a shame. WIth these in, Live and Let Die would merit a four star rating instead of the three I gave."
5,McCARTNEY and MARTIN Bring JAMES BOND into the 70s,"Gone is Sean Connery and so is John Barry! Paul and Linda McCartney compose the main title and perform it together with Wings! George Martin scores the rest of the film. This was the greatest departure from the Bond formula as Roger Moore took over the role of James Bond in 1973's ""Live and Let Die"" and what a departure it was. Pleasantly this is not a bad Bond album. It is a good combination of background and source music, which has a strange cohesive quality about it that really works. The best cuts on the album are `Trespassers Will Be Eaten' and George Martin's 70's interpretation of ""The James Bond Theme."" Paul and Linda McCartney's main title composition is also very good."
3,OK Bond soundtrack,"Live and let die is an a-typical Bond film. No martini's (neither shaken nor stirred), no tuxdoes, no Q, no M's office... still it's the good old 007 action. The music is strange as well, being composed by 5th Beatle George Martin, execept for the title track by 1st Beatle McCartney. Martin's music is very 70ies but also very enjoyable, and it makes good use of the Bond Theme. It's not as Bond as you might expect, but it's a nice soundtrack none the less."
3,You Only Live Once: The Second of the Non-Barry Bonds,"""Live and Let Die"" (1973) introduced a new Bond, Roger Moore, and a new musical team, Paul McCartney and Wings and former Beatle's producer, George Martin, to set the tone. The primary focus here was to produce a hit title with Paul and Linda McCarney and Wings. Martin simply came with the deal. The title remains one of the most dramatic and best songs of the series, and was especially striking with Maurice Binder's amazing opening and end titles. George Martin's score included a foundation based on the James Bond theme and the title song, but he also introduced a fine theme for Solitaire, and interesting island music for ""Baron Samedi's Dance of Death"" and ""Sacrifice."" Without McCartney and Wings, George Martin would not have sufficed, but together they produced one of the best non-Barry soundtracks."
3,A VERY 70's JAMES BOND SOUNDTRACK,"This is a soundtrack that tracks like 3, 4, and 14 show is very 70's. Track 14 is good version of the James Bond theme though. But tracks like 2 and 8 are kind of boring except for the odd sense of spunk they offer. The beginning of 9 is good but it turns boring. A very dull soundtrack except for a few good songs. The title song is O.K. but is kind of like SOUL music. George Martin is O.K., but like many artists that do James Bond soundtracks other than John Barry, they don't really capture the James Bond feel in their soundtracks. If you really like James Bond then get this."
3,Recommended by French Teacher,"I bought this book on the recommendation of my French teacher at the French Alliance. For someone learning French for the first time you'd definitely need this as an addition to French lessons since everything is in French and there's no vocabulary explanation in it. The price from this seller was very reasonable compared to what they were selling it for at the school. Even though it came from the UK, it still came within 10 days."
1,"""Acceptable"" really means ""Trashed""","Alright! Almost $20 for a book that is inked throughout and looks like it's been dunked in coffee and water. The cover looks like it was folded over itself several times... All in all it an embarrassment made worse by the privledge of paying for this ""acceptable"".I guess my standards are just too high..."
3,Pop Rappin',"MC Hammer was a straight up pop rapper who appealed to the masses more than the harder edged acts like NWA, Erick B. & Rakim, Ice-T, etc. However, his music was appealing and energetic as proved by the two best cuts on here, ""Let's Get It Started"" and ""They Put Me In The Mix."""
4,Neat and sturdy,"Easy to install. Note however that the part with the key pad detaches totally when the lock box is opened. I was expecting it would be a hinged-door design (less one star for that). Also, you need to punch the code once again when you are locking the box. Nevertheless, it is built very sturdily and should last a long time."
4,It works,"The box seems secure. Many similar styles are difficult to close and this one is no exception. If you know the tricks, there are no issues, but if you wish to to give the code to people who are not familiar with these devices, you may be disappointed."
3,Pretty Basic,A no thrills basic key box. Many may not be aware that you can only use each number once and do not have to enter them in any particular order. I only use for my hide-away-key in my garage.
4,Comparing The DVD To The Previous VHS Release,"This is a review of this product:G.L.O.W. Vol. 2 - The Saga Continues DVD. Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply. After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assurred that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------This DVD was previously releasedon VHS in 1986. The picture is a bit darker than the original videotape, the audio was turned up a bit too loud, and there are faint picture rolls throughout that were not in the tape. All minor video and audio defects were in the original VHS release. By the way, all three GLOW DVDs contain the same slideshow and promo bonus features."
2,massager,"we have had similiar massagers from same mfg.in past. This one is not as high powered as previous ones. I have back problems and use massager on my back daily, I am dissapointed with this one."
1,Wrong Info provided,When ordering it asks to select your vehicle and was assured it would fit the 2012 Toyota Camry SE - received pkg today and it does not so now have to return pkg - If it had not said it would fit my vehicle I would not have ordered yet Amazon is stating they will charge the return UPS fee??
1,Angry,this does not fit the 2012 camry door handles...waste of time and money. I was very excited to have these items sent to me too. smh
5,Allison's music hath charms to soothe the savage in us,This is uplifting music that refreshes the human spirit and prepares it for noble thoughts. Allison's music takes me to a higher level. It's universal and his language touches the hearstrings deep inside the soul.
5,Better than Coca Cola,"The Inca Kola is better than Coca Cola for sure. At least in Peru, since I was born there, I had been drinking it all my life and we all Peruvians know the difference between both sodas. Inca Kola seems to keep you happier than Coke. So for regular occasions drink Coke but for the special occasions Inka Kola is the answer. That's why now even Amazon sells it here. Whow! looks pretty demanding by now."
3,GeneraKola,"The prices here are outrageous! You can pick this up at Wal-Mart for less than three bucks. Anyway, you probably want to know about the taste. The taste? It's not amazing. Not bad either, but it is your run of the mill soda. And it doesn't taste like Coca-Cola. It is not a yellow Coca-Cola. The taste is closer to kola champagne or cream soda -- except it has a hint of lemon/citric acid."
5,Sweet,"Very good soda . I add a little club soda to it . I mix it about 2/3 soda to 1/3 club soda and find it perfect .Now I get it at a spanish supermarket, 1.99 for a 2 liter to save quite a few bucks. Enjoy!!!!"
5,Great detroit based sound!,"They always kick ass!Almost every song is a pleasure to hear out.Im still wondering why The Hellacopters doesntget more focus.Other cool swedish bands if you care,are:Sahara hotnightsThe HivesMillencolinRoxetteJens LekmanAce of baseYngwie malmsteen"
5,Great Rock N Roll,"Awesome Album! What I love about this group is their ability to combine the hard nosed, heavy approach of the MC5-Stooges with the catchy, pop sensibilities of the Ramones-70's punk. The songwriting is in great shape. I think in some ways the addition of Dahlquist, the tutelage of Scott Morgan (Sonic's Rendezvous Band)and the keyboard work of Bobba Fett has brought this group's abilities up a notch. In some ways, they have come very close to what the Aussie group Radio Birdman was achieving in their sound. I love it and you will to."
5,Rock Saviours,"The Hellacopters ""High Visibility""is doubtless their best album and such a roaring orgy of riff rock that one can only wonder why other bands are permanently lauded(and not even the White Stripes manage to marshal this insane amount of energy) while the Hellacopters remain big players only in Europe.The breakneck speed at which the album rolls is only matched by its crunching tunefulness and ability to launch anthems such as ""Hopeless case of a kid in Denial"" ,""Baby Borderline"",""Toys and Flavors""or""Throw Away Heroes""on a frighteningly regular basis.This is how all the 21st century rock n'roll should sound like."
2,It's alright!,"Filmed in Colombia and based on a true story fo the life of a sicario, AKA assassin for hire! The boring movies ia about a small boy who becomes a sicario in order to support his family! The movies was made with a very small budget, no real acting here, amateurs at its best. It does discloses the real life drama of the varios-projects in Colombia."
2,"Boring, horrible AI","I wanted to like this game. I've been a long time fan of strategy games.This one is horrible. Moving the units around using the joystick on the PSP is extremely tedious. But I supposed I could have gotten over that if the game was any good.Unfortunately, the AI is braindead, and poses absoutely no challenge. Even when massively outnumbered, the AI is incredibly easy to beat. Thus there's absolutely no challenge here, just the tedium of going through each map, and the ""story"" is so moronic and dumb it's beyond belief.Maybe this game has a good internet mode, but if I wanted to play a game on the internet, why wouldn't I just use my PC?"
2,Wrong UMD in case,"It arrived on time, the box was in great condition but when i opened the box I did not see Field Commander. Instead I got a copy of SOCOM: Fireteam Bravo. Great price just not what I ordered"
4,Great game - Grandsons love -,This product was in new condition. Received in a timely manner and the children love it. Very happy with this selection and the seller.
1,Okay Game,"This was an okay game but one problem... It's a ripoff of the best TBS game series ever made... Advance Wars. In the current AW game you controll the Allied Nations, which was copied into field commander, and the Orange Star army is the first army from whic youi get CO's, which in FC is the Orange Bandits. My tip, save money and get a DS and Advance Wars: Dual Strike. AW:DS has more CO's, more units and about as much missions, plus the bbonus of CO powers, super powers and tag teaming. In short, Sony should create their own games."
4,Nice turn-based strategy game,"If you're a fan of turn-based strategy games this game should meet your expectations. It's got nice graphics, easy to play, and can be played in all modes (single player, Wi-Fi, and Infrastructure). It has enough unit types with varying strengths/weaknesses to allow many defensive/offensive strategic decisions to be made. It's like playing a complex and dynamic game of chess.All in all I've been satisfied with this game and would recommend it for turn based strategy fans."
3,Not much here that you can't get from IRS publications,"Actually, they should call this book Taxes for Retards. I bought it with the hope that it would make doing my taxes a little bit easier this time around. No such luck.Most of the matter covered in the book is of a very elementary nature - that much you can figure out just by reading the IRS publications for the relevant forms.In most instances, i found that i had to go back to the irs publication whenever i had any doubt - the book only covered everything superficially.if you had no idea that irs publishes instructions for all forms or are among the esteemed few who think taxes are optional and/or that the slavery deduction is real- this book is for you. for others who have a fairly good idea of what you are doing, save the ** bucks and spend them elsewhere."
4,Useful in its time,"This was a useful guide in its time whereas now all the information covered in this guide is freely available on the Internet. Also, instead of reading small font, you can read any size font you want on your screen. The tax year 2001 was the last that I used text tax guides such as this one."
5,Excellent Selection Of New Orleans Bands,"This cd truly represents what the guys down here in NOLA are up to. Having been released in 1996, the music may sound a tad dated, but at the time, these groups were on par with anything you heard on the radio. The groups featured here worked their butts off to make every one of their shows something memorable. Being in the local scene for over a decade, I know many of the people that are on this album personally, and they are some of the most dedicated musicians I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. From the spacey rock of Garaj Mahal to the disco-gone-bad of Kwazi Moto, this is a great disc to own."
3,"Good album, Great movie","""Step into Liquid"" is an amazing movie, and the way the music is woven in with the visuals is just breathtaking. I must say I'm a little disappointed with the album, however. The reason I bought the album was for the music which is played during the hydrofoil shots in the movie, which I later found out was a song called ""Candle"" performed by VAST, and it's not included on the album... ""Touched"" is an awesome track, goes really well with the big wave surfing scenes. My favorite track is ""Cinecitta"" and pretty much all the original score tracks are sweet. I also really like the way the odd tracks are little commentaries by the great ones, it gets you stoked to go wax up your board and get wet, even if the waves aren't good... It's worth the few extra bucks to buy the DVD/CD combo pack they sell in surf shops."
4,"Great stuff, minus one?","Love this, but I'm a bit annoyed. I bought this album for ONE of the songs from the movie. (well, the rest of the songs are cool too, so I don't regret buying the album actually) but that ONE SONG is not on it. Hate that.I'm looking for the ""Carpe Diem"" song- anybody know who did it or where I could find it?"
5,good gift for a widow,"I bought this for my mom after my dad passed away suddenly and she was left with a lot of things to ""finish"" (life insurance, bills, accounts, etc). She has a lot of spiritual and emotional help from family, friends, and church but I wanted her to have some advice or help from someone who has been in the trenches. She said this book was a huge help and is now buying copies for other widows. If there's a widow in your life, get her this book...she may not read it right away but it'll be there when she's ready. It's probably the best thing you can do for her right now."
5,Insightful,"As a recent Widow I didn't want to join a group therapy, but needed a way to understand if what I was feeling was 'normal'. This book was very helpful to me since it helped me work through some issues and gave me practical guidance on how to move ahead. It confirmed what I was feeling was normal and allowed me to move through my grief rather than sidestep it.The author is an experienced psychologist who deals with widows in her practice and had a lot of real experiences to draw from. It was in a way like going to group therapy without having to leave the house.It was a good, helpful, and quick read."
4,book review,Very helpful book for those of us who are widows. I thought it had great real life stories and thoughts for all of us.
2,Not for the YOUNG WIDOW,"This book is primarily geared toward the 50 or older widow. The first few chapters are somewhat relatable for younger widows, but over all the book states the obvious and has generic suggestions for how to keep busy."
1,Condescending,"The first 70 pages of this book may be worthwhile. After that, the book is aimed at people who have never worked or never handled money. There are suggestions on learning to balance a checkbook. If you have worked and managed your own money this book is very condescending. I lost my husband 2 months ago so have been searching for helpful books. This is not one."
5,Good book to help with the stages of grief,I purchased this for a friend who found it helpful and comforting. She has repetitively thanked me stating that it has validated many of her feelings as well as giving her guidance on how to get through these extremely difficult first months.
5,Widow to Widow,"Helpful book. Had hoped to pass it on to a friend, but the book had been autographed on the inside front cover, making it unsuitable for that purpose."
3,Love it...but part of a page missing in Kindle Edition,"I love this book...well what I've read so far. I started out on a borrowed copy and loved it so much I purchased a kindle edition. That is how I know there is part of page 69 missing on the Kindle edition. The paragraph ended rather abruptly with no period...checked in the book and sure enough part of the paragraph is missing, hence the three star rating. Very disappointed about that and hope it doesn't happen again in the Kindle edition.The advice given is so on the mark for what I have experienced in my first year without my husband. And I've read more than enough ""widow"" books to know that this one hits a lot closer to the target than most."
5,new widow,"I found this book so helpful. I'm a new widow in my 50s, and even though it was written in 2004 and some things have changed, I appreciated knowing I was not alone, and have cried and laughed at times through this book. I would like to even re-read this when I am finished with it."
5,Best Book,"""Widow to Widow"" is, quite simply, the most useful book on widowhood that I have seen. It sums up the best of my experience in the worst of situations, taken from bereavement support groups, common sense, good advice, and hard-won personal knowledge. I expect to buy other copies to give as gifts."
5,"Found this book looking for books on bereavement, I am so happy I bought it!","My husband passed away two and a half years ago, and I have been looking for a book exactly like this one, from widows to widows. Only a person that has suffered the loss of a companion can understand what we go through.I have read most of the book in one day, at times it seemed like it was written for me. There are so many issues that I thought that I was the only one suffering from, and now I know that a lot of widows go through the same. Sometimes I found it even funny that things that I thought were because I am loosing my mind, are described in the book as being perfectly normal, and it made me feel better.I am now going to order one for my cousin and one for a friend who are also widows.Thank you Genevueve Davis Ginsburg for sharing your knowledge with us!"
2,Not as Helpful for Younger Widows,"Overall, this book is good for those having to endure the experience of being a widow, but it seems geared more towards women of another, older generation where women traditionally didn't work outside of the home and depended on their husbands to do the typical ""male"" things, like handle finances, home repair, etc. I lost my husband very recently and very suddenly, but have had a career for a long time and certainly know how to handle all the finances, etc. The book assumes that widows totally identify themselves as ""homemakers"" and through their husbands. It gives advice on how to hire handymen, assuming that most women cannot do home repairs or easily learn how to do them. Thus, I really couldn't relate to much of what was in this book since the advice seemed so dated to me. There are still some helpful chapters regarding the grieving process, but overall, if you're younger than maybe 65, this might not be the most helpful book to read."
5,"Thank God, a reality book!","I read a multitude of books after loosing my husband right before the holidays. Ms. Ginsburg ""hit the nail"" on the head for most of the REAL things I wold be facing. It was honest, humorous and convinced me I wasn't going crazy."
5,A guidebook to understanding Widows.,"My group ""The Surviving Spouse Association"" helps widows during the traumatic days after loosing a spouse. This book provides great insight into the mental anguish that these women suffer. It is well written and provides suggestions for helping understand these ladies. I recommend it not only for recent widows but also for their family members."
3,unknown,This prioduct was a gift so I have no Idea how to answer your questions.my mother swore by it when my father died and everyone we have gifted it too seems to appreciate it.
5,The magnetism of Scorsese,"My voyage to Italy, hosted by Martin Scorsese, is a wonderful trip down memory lane with the award winning director. Scorsese is back in his old New York neighborhood to take us on a trip down memory lane and how, as he grew up, the Italian cinema influenced his career. His passion for these films is contagious and with each movie clip you will want to screen the entire movie again. An interesting sidebar to this well produced documentary is that italian designer Giorgio Armani was the executive producer on the project."
5,Between Italian and Korean,"I originally made the mistake of purchasing My Voyage to Italy thinking that I was getting Journey to Italy. Both were well worth the price, even if you do not speak Korean. Bergman is stunning, even in Italian!"
4,Important Film History Lesson from Important Director,"I've always been curious about European film since so much has been written of it--and so little of it played here in the States!Martin Scorsese has made an excellent DVD that touches on his earliest influences and provides a tour of the Italian cinema from its beginning to its critical zenith in the 1950's and 1960's.I would recommend this DVD for anyone with any interest in foreign films. With Scorsese as a guide, you'll not only see the highlights and subtleties of each film, but you'll get historical details and a better understanding of the context from the narration.I'll definitely be checking out Scorsese's previous ""personal journey"" after watching MY VOYAGE TO ITALY."
4,Dedicated First,As everyone else says you first must have the desire and dedication to quit smoking. The patch helps with the cravings....that's all. I have been smoke free for 1 month now and I credit myself first and the patch second. Boy do I feel better!!!
3,Nicoderm Step 2 is overcharge,"It should have cost twice as less, as there is twice less patch in the package. It's perfectly fine to buy Step I and cut it in halves. It works in just the same manner. Company's statement about not cutting the patch is bs."
1,Didn't work for me,"I quit smoking twice, so far (hope I won't have to quit a third time but that remains to be seen...).The first time I used NRT, specifically NicoDerm. I followed all the three steps, for as long as it was recommended. It worked, I was able to quit smoking. Staying quit though, that was a whole different matter. I took smoking again after about 3 months, and kept smoking for 6 months when I quit again. This time around I used Allen Carr's method, and it was by far a more efficient method. It's all about mentality and unfortunately, NRT reinforces the wrong kind of mentality."
2,generic better,"I tried the nicoderm patches, in my opinion the generic patches are better.they stay on better and seem to work better"
2,Expired patches,"I was shocked to find that these patches expired 1/2008 (I received them February 2, 2008). I contacted the seller and he called me back very quickly. He was very nice and explained that he is allowed to sell expired products, and that, in fact on the description he had noted the expiration date. I admitted not reading the description closely enough, and that had I known they were expired I would not have bought them. He offered to refund my money if I chose to return them, but in the end I kept them. The seller seems to be a very nice guy who is trying to make a buck, but I do wish there were a rule against selling expired products. Also, I would advise anyone buying from this seller to read the reviews, because apparently expired products are common amongst this sellers stock."
1,Buyer be ware,"It's not the product I hate, it is Liftlfeller the distributor. Ordered this product & when it arrived in December it had an expiration date of Oct 2012. No disclaimer on the order page so I feel I was duped…. Shame on you Amazon for allowing your ISV to post a sale without full disclosure…."
3,Correct Aspect Ratios Please!!,"I've always enjoyed this film and my hope is that one day sooner than later someone reissues this DVD in the correct aspect ratio. I would've rated this Rene Cardona, Jr. film at 4 or 5 stars if I felt the ratio and quality was correct."
2,Monotonous,"I bought this video for my 2 1/2 year old son to give him different exposure to alphabet videos. He loves the Reader Rabbit Toddler CDROM, so I thought the video would be good. WRONG. The Alphabet Song that they use is l-o-n-g and monotonous! The story is ok, but the ""not-so-catchy"" tune is at the start of the video and is VERY difficult to sit through. If you haven't purchased it yet, I HIGHLY recommend Leap Frog's Letter Factory instead - without a doubt!"
4,Great for the chaos guys,"This book is great for those who play chaos armies in the warhammer game and tell tales of the history of chaos to their opponents to frustrate and demoralize them. It's many short stories combined into a single book, and the stories are all unheard of so it is a must for any dedicated chaos player."
4,"nothing new in this review, just more praise","Harlan Ellison's gift for using not just words but the *right* words is second to none. There's a conversational tone in his work that makes reading it effortless, or close to. Not only are the stories really good, if not great, but they're immensely enjoyable to read as someone who appreciates a master wordsmith when he reads one."
3,Not one of her best,"I liked the characters and plot, but I do agree with the first poster, that the romance aspect was rushed. There was a lot of information crammed in one book. The author could have made 2 books out of this story. The first about the romance between the 2 main characters, and the second about what happened after that in the book which was good. Williamson is still my fav. author though. Her other books are excellent. This was the only one that I thought was sub par compared to ""Heart of the West"" and ""Keeper of the dream"". I would still check this one out though."
1,Streetwise London Map,"Print is way too small. Hard to read. Prefer a fold out version rather than a ""flip"" style. Nor user friendly."
1,Not worth the price,"When I bought a replacement for my old Michelin Green for London, I added this, as it was suggested, and only cost $7. There is no reason to buy this; the same and better maps are in Michelin, which is of course thicker, but otherwise the same size. It's difficult to read,and is simply not worth the price."
2,"great unless you want to go somplace under the giant ""Streetwise London"" title!","See that giant gold ""Streetwise London"" logo in the picture? that covers a very nice cadre of neighborhoods, maida Vale, Little Venice, Queens Park, that you might someday want to visit. If you want basic tourist London you'll be fine tho. Just saying no need to make the logo so big - youre paying for a map afterall, why not get map space you paid for! Since I moved to London and am looking for a place to live, find it incredible annoying because those are nice family friendly neighborhoods..."
3,For central London it's a great tool!,"A week in London, and this map was with me on every outing. The Streetwise Map is a great help in navigating Central London, but if you want to go beyond ""Zone One"" on the London Bus and Underground system, this map will be of no help at all."
3,"Yes, its a map",Could stand to cover a bit more area. Don't plan on using it outside the center of London.
