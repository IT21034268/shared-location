4,International Intrigue,"Being on a grand jury is a unique experience especially if you have an inquisitive mind as the main characters, Susan and David did. Combine international intrigue, corrupt police and ADAs and Chinatown and you have an exciting adventure story of suspense and mystery.Friedman throws a little romance into the stir without making it seemed contrived or sorted. His portrayal of the US criminal justice system illustrates his deep understanding of it and brings an authenticity to the story. A fast moving action filled read."
3,grand journey,600 page potboiler entwining transitions in new china and law enforcement corruption in nyc with a saccharine romance as the inter-continental binding. ambitious effort to shed light on changes in china. love conquers all subtext.
1,BORING---SNORING,This Book had to be written by Al Gore! If you are interested in little tidbits about Chinese then you may find this book interesting. I made it through 356 pages before I finally pitched over head first onto the floor and went to sleep. I always hate to give up on a book but had to on this one.David E Millerdmiller@ocsonline.co
1,IT STINKS,VERY<VERY<VERY BAD Movie Horrible picture and sound It is the worst I have seen and its my fault I took the chanch and was OOO so wrong.
5,"Outstanding ""One Stop"" source on German aircraft cockpits.","A great book for the casual enthusiast or serious modeler. This book contains photos from recent restorations, vintage technical manuals and personal collections of WW II Luftwaffe fighter aircraft cockpits. Detail includes descriptions and photos of individual aircraft instruments, life suppport equipment and even subtle differences between aircraft cockpit variants. The usual suspects (BF-109, FW-190) are well covered, but MANY more obscure subjects are included... too many to list here.Yes, it's pricey, but absolutely worth it. I can't wait for Vol. II...Bombers!"
4,Decent light,"All I wanted was a cheap flood light that wasn't too fragile. This fits the bill perfectly. The shade is much sturdier than the ones at the hardware box store. It's not going to withstand intentional abuse, but it won't crush from a strong breath like the rest. My only quibble is the 6' cord. No cord should be less than 9'."
5,plant lite,"This is a very good product for what I was using it for, In the winter the sun is not out much in Michigan, so it really helped hanging this from the ceiling and giving much needed lite to the plants I am growing."
4,Andre Previn-The Planets by JHA,"I did not rate this #5, but it came very close. Any musical work that involves Andre Previn can be relied on to be outstanding, and this one was no disapointment.. Gustav Holst created the musical images and Andre Previn brought gave them life.. A most enjoyable CD.."
3,Purely a Novelty Disc,"I must admit, as an avid organ enthusiast, this is a killer concept; to play the entire Planets score on organ. A beautiful instrument it is too - however, I must agree with one of the other reviewers in that the hall is MUCH to ""wet"" and we fail to hear the articulations, rhythms, etc. and instead we are left with one giant chordal mass 75% of the recording. This makes itself manifest within the first 3 seconds of the CD - the infamous ostinato of Mars. What would normally be a driving and all-around sinister motif now just sounds like a simple drone.This issue carries throughout the entire wake of the recording and for me, absolutely renders the wonderful organist's virtuosity (in transcription and performance) totally void.However, aside from that major issue, I do have to give the organist a round of applause for his wonderful playing and transcribing abilities! Way to go!"
5,YESSSSSSSSSSS!,"This is the most amazing recording of the Planets that I have ever heard. It is so balanced and the clarity is unbelievable. This is a one of a kind recording. It is in a class by itself. I have yet to hear another orchestra's performance that can come close to touching the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra's recording. It is amazing! If you are wondering about which orchestra to get, purchase this CD and you will not be disatisfied."
5,5 stars!,"This person shipped quickly and came in great shape. Would recommend this sellinng to anyone.This product is great if you enjoy a good ""band-like"" song. We played some of the planets in high school. It brought back great memories!"
4,IT'S GOOD,"I don't even like most classical music, I'm into techno, but Holst's style is so different from many others that I like it anyway. MARS and JUPITER are the best tracks. Wish there were more tracks."
3,INTERESTING,"THIS CD WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU BUY IT. A GOOD LISTEN, BUT NOT MY FAVORITE."
3,Enjoyable but somewhat flat sounding,"I find the recording quality of this CD to be somewhat lacking in ""life"". It can be very dynamic in places, yet it seems uninvolving and distant. I get ample bass but it seems to be rather laid back in the mids and seems to have no sparkle in the highs. There seems to be plenty of depth and soundstage width to the recording. All in all, it sounds kind of muddy.I'm going to listen to some of the other recordings recommended by other reviewers here to see if I can find a more lively, involving recording. I doubt it is the fault of the LSO; I think the recording engineer just didn't do a very good job of capturing the ""life"" of this performance."
1,misleading,This film is inferior over all. The description is not at all accurate. Don't waste your time and money. You're better off watching paint dry.
5,BBBH Gets Thumbs Up From This Mom,As the mother of an only child this video helped my son share in a cooperative way and it helped me to calm sqabbles with other children who didn't want to share. If you're pulling your hair out trying to get your child to understand how to share their favorite toy this is the video to teach them how.
3,"Broad, but uninspired","Slive's book is a basic introduction to the art of the Northern Netherlands during the Baroque era. It covers a wide range of artists and genres, but fails to consider the wide interpretative issues of the art. When Slive does attempt interpretation, he tends to fall back on old-fashioned methods that have since been disproved by modern scholarship. The prose is boring and bland, but the book does feature many photos (although more of them could be in color). Overall, an introductory text that covers a lot of ground but has little depth."
5,This posthumously-published collection is a must read!,"This collection is a must-read for Brautigan fans, and a perfect introduction to Brautigan if you've never before encountered him. As with most of his work, he causes the reader to see amazing images and can make you feel the pain he felt while writing about a lost love, or a love that never was. Also as always, Brautigan shows himself as a hopeless romantic, and with this collection has published what is, in my opinion, the best love poem ever written: ""someday time will die."" Obviously, I think Brautigan is brilliant, and this work is just another example of proof for me. READ THIS BOOK! and any other Brautigan you can get your hands on!"
3,Earliest Brautigan not his best: but all the elements here,"The Edna Webster collection gives readers, old, new, & those who might have lost touch, a glimpse of the earliest Brautigan. While possibly not his best work (But whose juvenalia is? Keats excepted), most all of the elements that we identify with Brautigan are here--humor, whimsy, overarching and immutable sadness. The only major weakness is a singularly ugly cover that seems to be an attempt to replicate the early, funky Four Seasons covers, but designed by someone who'd never actually seen one. Not to worry, however: while you're reading the book--and quite probably being charmed by the text--you can't see the cover. Mayonnaise. --Kevin Jones"
3,PRICE SHOP!!!,"I own this watch and unfortunately bought it through amazon. I've had it a year now & still love it. HOWEVER, go on the internet and you will find the same watch by other, reputable sellers, for much, much less!!!"
4,Fix-It-Up Johnny,Christmas present for my 2 year old son. He loves it - it's now late January and he still plays with it daily. Only drawback is the tool storage compartment lid does not stay on making the compartment unusable. I now have the lid taped shut or it's always on the floor. Otherwise great toy.
3,Not as fun as it seems,"The storage unit is not great for the parts. The tractor itself though is durable and fun just as a push tractor. Believe the reviews, I did not and was a bit dissappointed."
1,John Deere Tractor Toy,"Please don't waste your money on this toy. While the idea of the tractor is fix it and play. This toy came out of the box not working. I was embarassed when the toy would not stay together. It has many problems. It looks cute, but again it does not work. My nephew was frustrated with the toy. Stay clear of this tractor."
2,Good idea but poor execution.,"Idea is great but lousy design and development. Lid broke off in first 15 minutes. Gives a ""command"" every 10 seconds or so for the first minute and then ""powers down"". Needs to simply have a ""go"" button but alas, none. In the end it was more disappointent than anything else."
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","As other reviewers said, it is impossible to keep the roof of this tractor on. Even if it did stay on, my 3 year old son wouldn't know how to put the screwdriver in AND close the lid as it needs to be placed very specifically to close the lid. I don't like that this tractor says the same thing over and over. It asks for its gas tank to be filled, which my son does, and then its very next request is to have its gas tank filled again. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to when it is fixed and drives on its own as opposed to when it's time to power down. For the amount of money it costs, I just think this toy should be a little bit smarter."
1,Not a quality product,"If you are buying for the Rotisserie, don't. The ends continue to pop out and thus it quits turning. The food burns on one side and the other side is raw. It is an engineering nightmare. The rotisserie can get stuck in the machine and the food is almost impossible to get out after it is done (on one side). It is a waste of money."
1,Customer Service (non-existent),Purchased the Bravetti platinum pro XL Toaster oven/Rotisserie by EURO-PRO Corp. Jan. 2003. The very first time I used the rotisserie to cook a 3 lb. chicken the rotisserie wheel failed and upon re-attaching continued to pull apart. The rotisserie wheel assembly was clearly defective. Contact with EURO-PRO proved very difficult. Their customer response voice mail system did not accept calls. Their published web address does not work. After 2 weeks I was able to contact a live person at their published 800#. The customer service rep. took all the relevant info regarding the purchase etc. and assured me EURO-PRO agreed there was a design defect associated with the assembly and would be shipping me a new rotisserie wheel assembly that day. This is now the end of April 2003 and I'm still waiting. I suspect I will not be receiving the assembly and the added feature was the primary reason for the purchase of the Bravetti.
3,Well my wife loves it anyway...,The convection fan on our first EuroPro started howling after about a year. With an extended warranty we sent it back and got another as my wife just loves the oven. She bakes everything in it and we don't hardly use the big oven anymore. Does rotisserie chicken fine but takes too long to just give me a piece of toast. The controls are not very good and the bell is small and tinny. So I have mixed feelings about the EuroPro.
1,dissapointing product,"I chose this oven because it seemed to have the large capacity that I was looking for. It has good looks, but each time I recieved a ""brand new"" oven, immediately had a problem. The first time, one of the heating coils failed to light, I was sent a new one but decided to use the ""old"" one, since it did heat up. After it finally died, I brought out the new replacement, It heated properly, but the door hinge broke & the door dangled. I decided to order another one, again for it's large size, & this one too showed defaults, none of the coils lit to indicate it was getting hot, plus I never heard the fan, (it was a convection oven) I am back to square one, looking for another convection oven, it won't be a Euro Pro."
3,Too big,"I got this as a gift for my husband. He always wanted a rotisserie as he likes to experiment cooking all types of meat. When it came in we were all amazed at how HUGE it is! I got this maybe 2 years ago and it is still in it's original box as we have no room to set it up, but that was my mistake. All in all, if I had the room, it would definetly be up and we'd be using it for every special occasion roasting a ham or roast."
4,My husband acts like it's a secret family recipe,"I like these jerky spices because it makes it easy to turn lean ground beef (or other lean ground meat) into jerky that my family loves and is much more economical than buying jerky anywhere. I prefer the original to the other flavors so I can ""doctor it up"" to my taste. This has been a hit with family, friends, and when my husband talks to people about the jerky I make, you would think that it's a securely guarded multi-generational family recipe. *LOL*"
5,Keeps them coming back,I just started making venison jerky. I decided to try this until I could figure out my own flavor. I don't need to try anything else. People at work keep coming to my desk to get more. A quart size bag doesn't last the day. It has really good flavor and easy to use
5,"Nesco American Harvest BJ-6 Jerky Spice Works, Original",This is the BEST tasting seasoning for jerky that was ever made! The price is right and this is an excellent product. I love buying items through Amazon.com. It has been a wonderful experience for me on every item that I have purchased! Thanks for making buying on line fun and confirming the idea of integrity and safety to purchasing on line.
5,Nesco Original Flavor Jerky Spice,"Great flavor as always, but the new packaging is a big improvement, it keeps the contents from clumping."
2,Jerky flavored salt?,"This stuff makes the saltiest jerky I've ever tasted. The basic flavor is okay, but whew, the salt! I haven't tried it with half the curing package yet, but that's my intention next. If it still isn't eatable, the rest of this stuff goes in the garbage. That much salt cannot be good for you."
5,Brilliant! Immortality at is't best!,"The story about Manji, the Ronin samurai who is cursed with immortality and has to slay a thousand evil men before he can die and Rin, the only surviving daughter from a slaughtered family, bent on hellish revenge against the man responsible for her familys death, Anotshu.In Dreamsong, Anotshu's love, the beutiful Geisha and secretly Japans best swordswoman, sets out to kill Manji for her lovers sake. Before that Anotshu will not marry her. So the man who gave up his right to die, faces the woman who gave up her right to dream.The story is dreamy and intriquing and the art is a blend of Manga with western influences and is very tastefull."
3,Good with Room for Improvement...,"I agree with each of the reviewers. I found the Cut Green Beans to be very tasty, a bit stringy, and a lot of liquid in the can. I've grown, picked and canned green beans in my younger years and enjoy the convenience of just opening a can. These are wonderful to eat right out of the can, chilled or with a few CANNED Kidney Beans tossed with Catalina French Dressing (Lyn's 2 Bean Salad). Put this on Subscribe and Save, it's worth it to not have soggy green beans!"
1,Rusted Cans,"We have purchased Westbrae Organic Cut Green Beans in the past and they are very good. We, recently, purchased two cases from Amazon for over $50.00, and that was a total waste of money. We found out, after purchasing them, that even if they are damaged they are not returnable.This is a first for us, as we purchase items several times a week from Amazon and have never had a problem before. We will be VERY cautious about purchasing ANY food items from them again.The cases were dry and bubble wrapped nicely, however, the cans were all rusted. It appears that Westbrae might be using Amazon as a dumping zone for bad cans, so buyer beware."
5,Westbrae Organic Cut Green Beans,Another big hit! Delicious! I will be ordering these regularly. Amazon--Thanks for another great product!
1,Book for the Beginner,"Good book for the BeginnerThe book was published in 1985, so a lot of the technology has changed and improved. It was a real basic book- this is a battery, this is a circuit. I was looking for help rewiring a small boat and this boat was of no major assistence."
1,Bible for grade schools,"This book should be left in the class room, unless you want to know the very basic's of a single engine boat's charging system. This book does not even go in to twin engine, boat's with 120 volt genset's,selector swithes for shore power to generator power, or anything more than a two battery system.If you need help rewiring your boat then I suggest you keep looking"
3,12V Bible Review,"Good as advertised - a basic book. Turned out it wasn't really what I was looking for. As another reviewer wrote, if you already know how to use a multi-meter it's probably too basic.Well done for its advertised purpose."
4,"12 Volt Bible , Good advise for all battery systems","The 12 Volt Bible is labled for Boats , but gives good wireing advise and direction for all forms of DC-Battery systems.Great for Boat , RV , Solar , Remote Cabins ...easy to read and understand (also use) wireing advise for NEW or ADVANCED owner-users of DC power systems. I like it!"
4,It works,"It was much lighter and cheaper than I expected, but it has done its job several times now. I don't expect it to last forever, but I needed one in a pinch and this works just fine."
4,Got the job done,"I read the other reviews when I purchased these, and decided that I didn't need hardcore heavy duty cables for my little Protege. When my battery died, they fired up my car on the first try.Two weeks later we tried to jump a V8 jeep with these cables and it took about ten minutes of letting the cars sit together before the jeep would start. I don't know the exact physics of this (whether it was the cable or the battery), but when the jeep died again we had better luck with a more intense set of cables.Since the jeep isn't mine, I'm quite happy with this purchase. They're cheap and they'll get my car started in emergencies.Got the job done."
2,I've changed my mind.,"I used to like this book because I identified with one of its main characters solely because of our similar ethnicity. I think that's fairly dumb now - this book is less about being AsAm and more about being human. The spaces we share; the neuroses that define us ... if you happen to eat rice and take your shoes off at the door, that's cool too -- but at the end of the day, even checking the same box on a racial form can't make me look past this book's obvious flaws. The narrative will not grab you, and quite frankly, the characters aren't that compelling. Nor are their neuroses."
3,A good love story with meditations on race mixed in,"Mr. Wong's novel explores the difficult issues of race and identity, especially in intimate, one-on-one situations, through the experiences of a middle-aged Chinese American, Raymond Ding. While the material about race, culture, and family is interesting, the strength of this book is a love story between two searching and genuine characters that need each other."
1,racial & cultural sensitivity?,"Aside from the author's mocking, offensive stereotype of the Hawaiian hula dance (see p.163), I thought this book was a dandy!"
3,SHOWS DUTIFUL PROMISE,"I found this book ""not too bad and more on the good side."" I couldn't let the book down and finished it within two days (it was rather short). The dialogue was a little over-the-top at times--do people really speak that well and clearly to each other? The characters' attraction to each other needed some fleshing out....but similarly, the relationship issues they were going through was VERY REALISTIC. I found the sex in the novel to not be childish but more sentimental--would the main character reflect upon sex that way? What really got me involved in the book was the way the writing flowed and the humor that was dead-on."
2,Boring......,"I bought this book with great hope that this book would be different from the typical books written by Asian American women, but was greatly disappointed. The text was dull and the characters were not interesting at all. I wound up feeling like the author did not develop the story line very well. Not a book to read unless you have a lot patience."
3,"Informative, but...","Shawn Wong was praised by critics for his ability to work humor into a subject matter not usually known for its comedy, and while the fictional account of Raymond and his flip-flopping love affair with Aurora *did* provide a bit of lightheartedness, it offered little else.With the thin, wandering plot-line, and the inconsistencies between some characters' relationships with each other, grouped with the top-heavy ratio of Raymond's ranting to actual plot developments, it seems more of a manifesto rather than a novel.That said, I admit it was enjoyable to read and a very informative viewpoint on living as an Asian American. It better serves its purpose if it is taken as a manifesto with interesting characters and an episodic plot structure."
3,Disturbing,I read this book 6 months ago and I have been arguing with the narrator in my head for that whole time. Its a compelling story that for me has gotten better the more I've thought about it. I look forward to the author's next novel.
5,Great place to start,"I was introduced to Nietzsche with this book, and have become addicted. The language is absolutely beautiful, and I think Hollingdale's translation brings out a lot of subtleties that the other translations don't. (If you can, compare passage 16 of various translations to see what I mean.)A lot of Nietzsche's most prominent ideas (history of morality, noble vs. common types, nihilism) are present in this work, which makes me say that it's a good place to start to get a basic understanding of his ideas. Another recommendation would be The Gay Science, although that one's a bit more radical in that it's the first time that Nietzsche mentions the death of god.A warning, though. If this is indeed your first encounter with Nietzsche, read him slowly. Let the ideas sink in before going on. Since the passages and aphorisms are short, the tendency is to read them through quickly, which causes you to overlook the underlying meaning."
3,Heavy,"This takes time to digest no matter how smart you are. But it's worth it, make the journey through time and see how a ranting madmamn/genius sees the world and mankind!"
3,Its always there,"First off, the suction only works for a while, the rubber jaws can fall off and get lost, its light duty and has limited range. Having said all that, its always in a drawer near the kitchen or dining room table when I need it for one of those honey doos. At least ten years of household usage hasn't hurt it one bit. If I've got some serious work I take it to a heavy duty vice in the shop. I'd rate it better if the price was more in reason, but now $49.99 plus $6.99 for shipping, they want an arm and a leg, so that drops the rating. A price of Thirty bucks shipped would be more than enough for this product."
3,Poor suction.,This is about what you would expect from such an inexpensive vise. I was disappointed by the lack of suction. I can only get it to hold well on completely nonporous surfaces. If you have a Formica workbench then you're set. If it's laminated particle board then don't expect it to hold.
1,Don't Even Bother,"This video is no good at all. Fortunately for me, I rented this tape and did not purchase it. The info contained within is very little and provides nothing new at all. The re-enactments are laughable. Please don't waste your time or money."
5,An EXCELLENT Series to no end!!!!!!,"I have found myself so engulfed in these books!! I have yet to read number 5 as I am still into 4,but I love them already!!!! I found myself laughing when the characters laugh,cry when they cry,pray when they pray!!!! This series is definetly by far the most wonderful series i have yet to read!!! I would tell anyone to read these books!!!! You will be captivated at the way the characters push on through many trials and heartaches!!! For those of you who have not had the privalege to read these books......read them!!!!! B.J.Hoff is a most talented author!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Plenty of space, not overkill, just right","I was looking for a home for my DSLR, extra lens, and other accessories. I tried a couple setups and in the end this was a good fit. I wish I had found this before I spent all that money on other setups. In this bag there are just enough compartments for all my gear and even a little extra ""hidden"" space under the velcro platforms for things you don't need to get to as often, such as a spare lens cap or an extra neck strap. I like knowing my gear is protected and it's all in one place. Overall, this is a great product with plenty of space that is not overkill but just right."
1,No Frying Fryer,"I bought this POS at a local retailer. It worked long enough to half cook the food during it's 1st use. I returned it, and got another one. This one didn't work at all. The third and final unit would constantly trip the circuit breaker. I returned the last one and got a refund.There is a hidden price to be paid for merchandise built by Tiawanese slave labor working in Chinese factories. The price is lack of quality. Thank you NAFTA!! (Yeah, right). Guess what?? Ross Peroit was right....Don't waste your time or money on this garbage. Get a Presto Fry Daddy and be happy.The Fry Daddys work pretty well, just don't overload them so the oil's temperature drops too far at the beginning of the cook cycle. They don't recover very quickly, so the food gets soggy. Many small loads are MUCH better than a few oversize loads."
1,Very Short Lived,"Unlike the reviewer from Lexington NC (Short Lived, July 9, 2003), the fryer I received did not take six months for the circuit breaker to start popping. It started with the very first use and did it again on each of the next two uses. Fortunately for me it was within the first week after receiving the unit and I returned it."
1,Product never worked - and customer service STINKS!,"I received the fryer, and immediately invited friends over for a ""fry fest"". The oil heated up, I placed food in and within 20 minutes, the oil was no longer hot. The control panel was lit, but the oil did not maintain the temperature and did not heat up. RUINED FOOD!! So instead of returning it, I called Euro Pro - they promised to send me a new control panel immediately. 8 weeks later I received it. The control panel was not the same one that was originally in the fryer, and the magnetic break away cord did not fit on the ""new"" unit sent. So I called back, and was promised the new cord would be shipped within 48 hours. I still do not have the cord (it is STILL on its way - 2 1/2 weeks later). The woman at Euro Pro was very rude to me, and refused to refund my money if I were to return it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! I HAVE BEEN WAITING 3 MONTHS FOR THIS FRYER TO BE USED!"
1,Stainless Steel Lemon,"Unit would not hold any temperature settings. When checked with accurate thermometers, 350 degrees F read 220 degrees F, 375 degrees F read 230 degrees F. Unit was not functioning from very beginning. Unfortunately, wasted a bit of food, till I discovered it was taking ""forever"" to fry the simplest of foods. Food was so saturated with oil, I decided to check the digital read out with thermometers. The unit goes back tomorrow. Luckily I bought it from a local retailer. I cannot imagine paying postage to and from for defective merchandise. One mail order vender advertised this unit as ""non returnable"". Wow! <br /><br />The unit looks great, is easy to clean, but is a lemon ... would not trust Euro Pro ... too many negative reviews."
1,Panel Failed,My Euro-Pro fried wonderfully for 3 months. The panal has now failed and I am in the process and trying to get a new one. The problem maybe that the steam rising right into the control panel. This is a known problem with electronic controls. The later models have the control on the front - that might be better.
2,Short Lived!,"Excellent product when first received. Food fried quickly,tasted great and the oil lasted longer. After about six months the circuit breaker on the fryer kept popping. I quickly discovered that the thermostat had gone bad allowing the fryer to overheat and trip the circuit breaker. Item is still under warranty but the postage to mail the item back for repair and back to me would equal half as much as the fryer cost. Think I will dispose of fryer and buy some thing different."
3,NOT for the inexperienced,"If you need this book for a JAVA class, of course buy it here.If you are trying to learn java on your own, I do not recommend this one unless you are already an experienced programmer in object oriented languages.It is very tough, and would be impossible to follow for someone new to programming."
4,Godd service -- hard to find item,This vacuum filter is impossible to find in the stores -- even the ones that sell the Shark vacuum. (FAIL = Shark).This vendor had it in stock and it shipped promptly.
5,Can never go wrong with Wilton and Amazon!,"Of course, this is a Wilton vise, so it's truly awesome! I shopped around and happened upon it at Amazon.com, and I have to say this was the most amazing deal ever. The no charge shipping really helped out too, I'd definitely do it again next time without hesitation!"
5,terrific dvd for kids,My son absolutely loves this movie. He has had it for over a year and still watches it weekly. My only complaint is that the guest actors like emeril look like they are reading off script boards. But it really emphasizes healthy eating and is darling. My son likes to help me cook so it was right up his alley. Got it when he was turning three and now he is four and a half.
2,My Son was not at all interested...,But this is just a personal opinion. My son didn't find it exciting and it just didn't keep him interested. We just have to keep looking for something else that is as exciting and captivating as Grouchland. Now that was 5 Stars! Even me and my husband like that movie.
4,This one's a keeper,"This is the selected video of choice so often that I believe I've memorized the words...Emeril is a marketing brand name ""king""...when my 4 year old goes to the store and shouts ""Mommy, there's Emeril"" you know something's going right!"
5,Enjoyable documentaries.,Lots of historical backgrounds that I never knew about these masterpieces! Covered indepth details in history and great story line.
2,An uneven series,"I am another professor of art history who has reviewed many films and television videos in search of material that could be used profitably in the classroom. The individual segments of The Private Life of a Masterpiece series are uneven. The one devoted to Rembrandt's Nightwatch is exceptionally good--both the handling of historical questions and the explanation of its importance to Dutch national identity. The film is fun, interesting and informative (in large part thanks to the top-notch education department of the Rijksmuseum). The segment devoted to Botticelli's Primavera is quite bad. In this case the editors appear to have had little confidence in the serious views of the scholars who were consulted and chose instead to treat the painting as a bit of Renaissance smut. I would not recommend buying the whole box set."
1,Horrible Shipping,"Amazon shipped the 67lb vise in the same box that is used for shelf display. Needless to say, it is not meant for OTR shipping. When the vise arrived, it had been displaced numerous times in the box since it was not anchored to anything. This displacement of the vise actually sheared a perfect arc off of the 1/8"" piece of plywood underneath it, corresponding to the vise base. This displacement also caused one of the mounting feet from the vise to break off and the vise had to be returned. Upon calling Amazon for return, they told me that the vise was no longer available and I was to receive a refund. The refund was correct compensation, but it made me waste approximately one and a half weeks of my time to get another vise from another location."
1,Don't buy this,"I have studied the book about admiral Yonai. So what I tell here is only about that. But for me it is enough. If you take his book about Yamamoto: ""Yamamoto: the man who planned Pearl Harbor"" (New York 1990) you will find that what Yamamoto did in the one book about becoming (vice-)minister of Naval Affairs, in the other Yonai did. Most facts about Yonai in ""Tree Military Leaders"" are wrong. And a lot about Yamamoto too! That was enough for me to lay down the book and keep it that way."
3,Excellent Music but disappointing quality,I wanted to hear Earl hum the tunes as he play just as I remembered when I saw him live at a club in NYC. You have to listen intently to hear him. This sounds as if they took the original tapes and recorded them onto a CD without alteration. The tape hiss is very evident on high quality equipment. At this price I would have at least expected the tape hiss to be eliminated and the sound quality to be enhanced.
4,Useful reference to the Classical World,"Oxford provides with us concise biographies of almost 500 real (as opposed to mythical) people from the Classical Period. The biographies were written by 190 experts and range from a paragraph to several pages, covering rulers, politicians, artists, authors, philosophers and scientists. Seperate chronologies are provided for the Greece and the East and Rome and the West. Five maps are also included. An excellent reference for the student and general public."
5,I use this for clay,"I use this oven for polymer clay, I got it at a good price and have been very happy with it's performance. The heating elements are farther from the clay which is good. The clay always comes out cooked right but no blisters and other problems I got from my regular toaster oven. I have never used another model of convection toaster oven so I can't say how it compares but since I couldn't happier with it's perforamnce for polymer clay I give it 5 stars."
2,Comes with no tray!,Looking for an inexpensive replacement for my old toaster oven as I mainly only use it to heat up snacks for my kids. This seemed to fit the bill. The box claims a tray comes with it - it's the crumb catcher. Have been scouring stores and garage sales for something that will fit in there ever since. I agree with the toast analysis of other reviewers - had to dig out the ole toaster again. Was hoping to save space and time. This product not worth the agrivation.
1,Toast burnt or not even toasted,"I just use it for toast. It takes about 10 minutes to heat up. So I turn it on and walk away (make a pot of coffee, scramble some eggs, etc.), then put the bread in. It is hit or miss whether the burners will ever actually turn red after this lenth of time. My toast will come out either burnt, or the oven will turn off (but not the ticking timer) before it's toasted even a little bit. No consistency with the brownness settings. I find I have to stand in front of the unit for 5 minutes and watch it like a hawk so I can turn it off at the right moment (meanwhile my coffee and eggs are getting cold).My old Black and Decker (RIP) used to make perfect toast to my desired settings in 1-2 minutes.I have not used this oven for baking, because most of the frozen foods I buy say ""not recommended for convection ovens"".All in all, takes up a lot of counter space and provides no usefulness."
3,A window into friendship and life,"I picked up Brother Men not knowing what to expect, but figuring it would be a quick and amusing read. What I found was a window into life as it was passing for Weston and Burroughs, not as it was remembered. This collection of letters spans the birth of two generations, two World Wars, and the trials of profit and loss. The conversation is friendly, comic, insightful, and random! At times I had to remember that the characters were real and that the letters existed. I actually was sad to end the book knowing that in a few years after the last letter this friendship would end. I think the book is great if you are a Burroughs fan, interested in history, or just enjoy how human relationships evolve. I highly suggest reading the introduction BEFORE and AFTER reading the letters."
5,Nice Value,"I've been using this light for a couple weeks and I'm very pleased. I've been remodeling my workshop and as the days get shorter, I needed more light.This takes about 10 minutes to un pack and set up. The color of the light produced is a softer yellow, not a harsh white. (So, if you need light that is full-spectrum, look elsewhere.) The orientation/direction of the lamps are easily adjusted and they stay put. The lamps are plenty bright and at a 1000 watts, you can feel the heat radiating from them.Heavy duty switches and construction. It is rated for use in wet conditions.However, if it is set at the maximum height of 7', it is a bit wobbly. Also, the cord is extremely short. This needs to be very close to a recepticle.26NOV05 A couple of days ago, I saw this at Home Depot for $35. It's currently advertised here for $52."
3,"Probably a good value, but seems cheaply made to me","This light is convenient and I am finding it useful while I finish cabinets in my garage. My first impression was that the quality is questionable. It's not super sturdy and the lights don't tilt downward, just straight or upward. I was hoping for more sturdy construction and assembly, but it's probably worth the price listed here. If there was a $100 option with better construction, I would have bought that. I also hoped that I would be able to slide the lights further away from each other laterally and that is not the case.Because of the high power consumption of these lights, I make sure to plug them into an outlet that isn't on the same fuse as my air compressor. I also keep the light fairly far away from my work because I use mainly oil-based finishes and don't want to start a fire."
4,Does the job,Its a very bright Coleman work light. It lights up work spaces adequately. Feels cheap in structure and base does not feel so solid. But you get what you pay for.*The base is what has me most worried. It is not very stable once stood up. Already had it get knocked over on a few jobs. Plus side is that it survived the couple falls without blowing out the bulbs.
3,speculation,"The chapters on Templar history were the best I have ever found.Very good stuff. Beyond that ... well, let's say the author maybe the very paragon of speculative Masonry."
3,Musicianship is superb; choice of selections questionable,"Heifetz was a master, so I have not complaints about the performances themselves. I purchased this for the Korngold which is defintely worth the price. But, the rest of the selections seem lesser examples of the same genre and did not hold my attention."
4,videonow spongebob edition,I chose this rating because this is a video that is popular with the kids and it is very easy to manage in the video now player..I would recomend this video to any parent that has a child who likes Spongebob cartoons
2,Too Much Christianity,"A good mission but poor delivery. I was very, very, very disappointed that this DVD focused on Christianity. The DVD should have mentioned that in its cover. Once a person combines history with mythology and then presents that mythology as historical facts - then it poses a big problem. The DVD lost credibility once that was done. I would file this DVD under Christianity or Religion. If you expect pure history, you will be disappointed, with this product. I would actually like to return my copy or give it away for free. Very disappointed. I gave it two stars because the mission of the documentary, as I understood it, to reveal history from the other side of the story (from Africans themselves) was good, but the execution was very poor, mixing it with Serapis Christos. I would advice the producers to get more historical facts on Serapis before they try and impose that on other people. Peace and blessings."
3,Too much religion,The movie in question is very good. I only have 1 problem that I would like to point out. It points toward the christian faith as the model for success. Singling out a particular religion narrows the audience to only those who believe in Jesus Christ's divinity. I would like a film that focuses on historical facts and not mythology.
4,1/2 and album of killer songs,"I got this album when it first came out in the early 80's after seeing the movie ""The Rise and Fall of Western Civilization,"" which chronicaled the L.A.punk scene of that period. I actually bought the soundtrack, which I would recommend if you can find it, because it contains live versions of three of the best Fear songs found on The Record.In any case I love about 1/2 the songs on the album for their sarcastically humourous, over the top lyrics and ... well they are just great punk rock songs. Lee Ving was probably a jerk, but who cares. He made 1/2 of a classic album. The other songs, frankly, I could just skip over."
2,Not that great,How many times can this repetitive sound be recycled and called unique . if youre going to be or try the unique trend . try to be unqiue ! Try The Dresden Dolls .
1,there still alive?,I used to like this band untill I had the misfortune of seeing this band live. The whole time I thought the singer was going to croke over and die. Thats the only reason I stayed. A right wing punk band isnt that an oxymoron. At least it was over soon. They only played for like 15 minutes. maby the encore lasted longer I had to get to my car before the crowd. If your one of the few republican punks go buy this record.
5,The Record Rules!,"Fear is one of my favorite punk bands right next to the Dead Kenndys, from back when punk rock was a more reconized genre. I am a teen, and so I'm glad to see CDs being realsed in more mordern times that arn't as disposible as Kid Rock or Stiff Baggel(I mean Limp Bizket), because that stuff is just as mainstream as the Backwash boys, and it tells younger buys what to buy and what not to. The guys of fear really no how to play their instermants at a faster and faster rate with out swiching toons alot, because the toon got tiersome.Their lyrcess are smart, but not for the easily offended, and thats just the way true punk rock should be instead of all of those punk possers like Green Day, Sum 41, and Blink 182."
3,Fear - 'The Record' (Slash),"Review no. 55. Originally unleashed in 1982, this was Fear's first of {looks like} five records. Never could figure out what exactly their 'cult following' ever saw in this L.A. hardcore punk band. As for I remember when every now and again Fear would play to a crowd of maybe 200 or so in some dive in my home town. I never saw them. A couple of these tracks I thought were okay include ""Let's Have A War"", the slamming ""Gimme Some Action"", ""We Destroy The Family"" and ""No More Nothing"". Looks like vocalist Lee Ving is the sole original / constant member in Fear. Might pull in fans of Minor Threat, the Germs, Agent Orange and Circle Jerks but DO keep in mind those bands do the job better."
2,"Don't Fear the Record, Just Avoid It","Even at 30-plus years, I can still enjoy many of the old punk records I've had since I was a kid. However, about the time I learned to drive and certainly by the time I was old enough to vote, I realized that I had outgrown The Record. At one time I thought Lee Ving epitomized all that was punk. I now realize that I had confused ""punk"" with ""goon"". If Darby Crash was the troubled outsider in high school, then Ving was the narrow-minded jock who beat him up for being different. There are much better punk albums out there."
2,"Saw these guys on SNL, and they played the ""New York is for people..."" song","I never really got into punk. Most punk bands spent whatever musical knowledge they had very quickly, and either ended up in obscurity or metamorphising into something more intelligent and mature (like The Clash). But I remember these guys on SNL in 1980, and they were hilariously bad. But I loved watching them. They did their mosh pit thing, played crap music, and were never really heard from again. I heard they got banned from the show afterwards (which really isn't such a bad thing, considering how awful SNL is)...."
1,tihs is a good book,"Jungle Dogs, by Graham Salisbury, is a boring story about a young boy and his struggling family. Boy Regis, a sixth grade resident in a Hawaiian village, loves his family, and even his punk brother, Damon. But he's more than terrified of the vicious wild dogs that are in the jungle. I didn't like this book much because it was boring. I recommend this book for kids from 9-12."
1,More bad news for Ground Zero,"I think it is great that new companies are attenpting to supply us with classic kung fu movies. Ground Zero actually has put out some great movies and I love them for it, but quality control must be an issue with them. Poor sound and defective DVD is what you get with this release. Aleaxander Lo Rei plays a man who must save villiage children from bandits after the bandits [attack]thier parents. The run to the hills where they meet a shaolin monk who teaches them Shaolin Chastity kung fu.Thats all I can tell you as my DVD skipped chapters and shut off on me which prompted a return to the store.Avoid the headaches and do not buy!"
1,Kung foey,This was a terrible dubbed movie. and the sound was too low. It was worth the money I paid for it. A Dollar.
2,Nancy Collins can do better--much better!,"After reading the Sonya Blue Trilogy and A Dozen Black Roses I wanted to read more of Nancy Collins. Unfortunately, Wild Blood must have been written for the bucks.From the cheesy cover to the 'werewolves are abused children' idea the book is hackneyed. All famous serial killers werewolves? Yeah, right! With the exception of a short section with a convict called Cheater, the book is rife with one-dimensional characters.The explanation of the 'werewolf lifestyle ' is laboriously drawn out and, in addition to being incredulous,is boring. It's hard to believe this is the same author who created Sonya Blue. Sonya would wipe out this creature with one swing!"
3,Nice Wolf....Story could have been better... 3 1/2 stars,"After reading other books by Nancy Collins, this book fell short of my expectations. The story had a stong beginning but slowed down and became a little far fetched even for a Werewolf story. It seemed like the main charter was directed throughout the entire story. From how he found the band of werewolf's/to the great meeting/to the final battle. Just to many unrelated occurrences needed to happen for this story to work. I would recommednd this book for any Nancy Collins fan (I am a big fan of her work) but this would not be on my must read list."
5,"If you haven't read this book yet, then your missing out","This book has everything a horror fiction reader absolutely loves. Death, Blood, Gore, Dismemberment. Anyone who hasn't read this book yet, is definately missing out. I have read this book over and over again, and I am still enchanted by the story line and the characters. This book is definately a must read."
3,not too bad but some suggestions below,"this book is a bit inconsistent but its Collins and for fans of Sonja it will be a decent book. For non Sonja Blue readers: read those, you will be much happier with them in general. Werewolf fans: Anita Blake has much more realized lyncanthropes."
5,Excellent Strummer solo effort,"I've loved this disc ever since I found it in a bargain bin in the early 1990s. Don't know why it was so maligned on its initial release. It contains some of Strummer's best stuff. I'm glad to see it's getting some love from reviewers. Sucks this release is cd-r, though I see it also includes an mp3 version free. I'm glad I've got the actual Cd with the lyric insert, but take what you can get folks. After reading about this release in a bio of Strummer, I'm surprised it's available at all."
4,Wow! $40? And worth it!!,"This is an incredibly underrated album despite the validity of much of the criticism. Yeah, the production had a drunk old geezer at the board, and Zander Schloss is said to have been a better actor than a guitar player.However, the thing about the album is that it holds up much better than the rest of his collection save for perhaps the Walker soundtrack, which might be even more expensive.""King of the Bayou"" (a salute to Cory Aquino) is one of the greatest things Joe Strummer ever wrote.The lyrics are outstandingly relevant in 2005. The guy was great at stating the shape of things to come by acknowledging them as already existing in the present."
4,Strummer is back,"I used to own this album on vinyl, way back in the eighties. It was a brilliant idea to re- release Earthquake Weather on CD, because it definitely withstood the test of time.A classic punk- rock song like the opening track ""Gangsterville"" or a more laid - back one like ""Island Hopping"", or the funky ""Boogie with your Children"" they all add to the legacy of The Clash.A must- have for all old and new Clash fans."
3,Is anyone ever 'first'?,"A broad and prolific mind, had Mr. Wells. This book shows him in his P&P mode: Predictor and Proselytor. 'The World Brain' sounds like the title of one of his many stories which more or less invented the field of science fiction as we know it. This is not so...this is non-fiction. Nor is it like such books of his as his world history. This, in fact, is a collection of his talks, given at home, here in the US, and in Europe over a three year period on the general subject of a need for a better encyclopedia. This book will prove boring, I suspect, for most because of its' repetitious nature but for the same reason, its' repitition, it is interesting to read as his ideas move over the period. And to realize, as they do, that he is in fact, creating what we now call the World Wide Web."
4,Basic hostess Guide,This book is a must have for any bride and would be a great shower gift or gift for brides maids. It tells you how to organize a party and provides great recipes that are easy to follow.
2,Boom is not so booming,"This alarm clock is in a box in my attic waiting on a yard sale. The problem is 2 fold. The vibration wakes up my boyfriend and the ""sonic boom"" doesn't wake me up. I don't know what they were thinking when they tried to make this alarm clock seem loud. I got a 15 dollar alarm clock from Target that would wake the dead and it works just fine for me. Another problem with the vibration is that I toss and turn and the thing always ends up on the floor, no matter where i put it. I would not recommend wasting your money."
5,Great Alarm for hard of hearing Son,"My son who is deaf without his hearing aids uses this alarm clock with 100% success to arrive at his classes on time every morning. His claim is that it is better than Dad (who occasionally forgot to wake him, or woke him to early)."
5,Awe-some!!,"I bought this clock for my Mother who is very hard of hearing. We don't use the buzzer, but if it doesn't wake you up, you might want to get your hearing checked! The tone and volume are both adjustable. The flashing lights on the top are a great addition to help wake you up. We recently hooked it to the telephone line so we could call her and wake her up and it works great! I can't think of any feature it doesn't have except a radio. It's easy to operate and all the buttons are self-explanatory. Every person is looking for something different in their clock, but this clock covers alot of bases. The vibration that the ""pod"" puts out is more than enough to wake the normal person even when it's put under your mattress. If this clock can't wake you up, you may have a serious medical issue and should see your doctor immediately."
4,Wow!!!,"I bought this for my brother-in-law. He used to use two alarm clocks positioned across the room. He used them to wake his wife, who would then kick him out of bed. Although I was disappointed in the volume of the alarm, the bed shaker seemed to be right on target. The results were successful. The shaker wakes him up without waking his wife. Marriage saved."
4,Great product,"I purchased 3 of these two for each kid and one for my husband. It has been great my son has been getting up for school on his own now. It wakes my husband up, but he is bad for hitting the snooze. The alarm isn't as loud as I would have liked it, but the pitch of the alarm works."
4,"Great Idea, but wish it were of higher quality","Bought this product at end of October 2008. It worked great for 3-months and was using it 5-days a week with only the vibrating alarm. After 3-months the vibrating mechanism stopped working so I switched it to the audible alarm which is good also, but I want a vibrating alarm.The good thing is the audible alarm has a volume dial control so you can adjust it to your liking.I just found out that the combination vibrate/audible setting does make my vibrating mechanism work, but maybe only half as strong as before.When the vibrating alarm completely poops out then I'm going to look for either a replacement vibrator or another vibrating alarm clock with hopefully better quality."
1,Effective until it malfunctions,"This alarm clock is generally effective, with the ample vibrating along with a loud alarm if you need even more push to get out of bed.The problem is the clock unit. It feels cheap, and performs only so-so. It appears as though it was purchased in a dollar store, or at the check-out counter at your local convenience store. You have to push the buttons hard to change the alarm time, etc. The buttons feel as though they have a weak electrical connection. They don't contact unless you really press on them. It is a poor design and cheaply made. Also, it doesn't keep good time.Worst of all, after only 6 months or so, the clock malfunctioned. I woke up to the vibrating puck going off (erradically) and I could not shut it off. Turning the alarm ""off"" like I do every morning had no effect. I had to unplug the vibrating device. There's one thing that alarm clocks need to be, and that is DEPENDABLE. This one is not."
4,Good Buy,"The sonic alert clock is great.I originally didn't want the vibrating part, and I just wanted the big sound alarm. Since you couldn't get one without the other I bought the clock with both.As it turns out, I put the vibrating part in a pan and it bangs inside the pan when the alarm goes off. It would wake up the dead.The clock alarm loud enough also.Good purchase."
1,Poor quality,If you want a product that lasts more than one year then buy something else. I have purchased two of these and neither lasted more than a year. The company has done nothing to solve this problem. I will be purchasing something from another manufacturer.
4,Great Product,"This Alarm clock is not a bad investment at all. It definitely wakes me up every morning. I bought it for the vibrator.I'll only list the cons about this alarm clock since you guys pretty can tell the pros by looking at the specs.- I wish the Phone cord is detachable just like all the other cords.- The Alarm clock gets hot on certain spots and even hotter if you use the vibrator, which makes me become more skeptical of things made in China.. The plastic part I was touching is not burning hot, but I wonder if the inside could boil an egg at that temperature.-I would not but this clock for the sound alarm because it only comes pre-set with four sounds and all four of those are pretty horrendously annoying. Well I guess that's the whole point of an alarm clock, but still."
5,A hard to find game,I was very impressed with the condition I received this game in. I've been looking for this game for years but never thought to look on amazon. I was then not sure if I should buy it used but this was in excellent condition and not missing one piece. I was very impressed with the quick shipping as well.Thank you.
4,Eisenkraft-Palazzola brings the fairies to life in this one!,This book had beautiful writings and pictures inside. It opened my eyes to a whole new world of fairies that are everywhere...
5,Watch Out Harry Potter...Here Comes Harvey Potter!,"This straightfoward book's subject matter is exactly what the title states- Harvey Potter's balloon farm. Magic is involved, but not a prissy, princess-wand-saving-the-unicorn-type...it is just plain, ol' deep soul magic creating happiness in the form of the balloons. The pictures grab ya and reel you in with their brillant colors. My kids and I pore over the pages looking for ""hidden"" animals, funny (and scary) balloons, small details (e.g.lightning, flying waterfowl), and animal-shaped clouds, trees, and even leaves on one spread. I love the down-home narration- it encourages the out loud reader to become someone else and go somewhere else with the listeners for some minutes. The quiet relationship between the two main characters warms the heart. Unusually beautiful."
1,Not worth almost a dollar each,"Really, over $10 for 12. I get annoyed when they sell them for .20 a pack at the store since I remember when it was .05 a pack. Ramen is great just not worth this price."
3,"This razor is NOT ""by Feather""","Feather is a major razor and blade manufacturing company in Japan, and they did not make this razor."
1,Be careful ordering parts on Amazon,"I ordered this part, it is the wrong one even though their ""part-finder"" said it was correct. I went on the manufacturers site to double-check and could not cancel or change this order even though it was done on the same day, a Saturday. I called ""customer service"" and got two yahoos from India who told me I could order the correct part and in two weeks they would give me a refund for the first, unbelieveabvle. The only reason I even looked at Amazon was because I was given a gift card. Never again."
5,QUICK PACED AND GOOD FROM THE START,"This is my first book I have read by Finder. I understand that he has another one on the way. And you know, I plan to be at the bookstore for the release. This book was an outstandingand it will be keep you wondering about the main character until the end; DON'T MISS THIS ONE. IT IS A SURE FIRECRACKER OF A GOOD BOOK. YOU ARE HOOKED IN, LINED UP. YOU WILL BE IN A HURRY TO FINISHED. DON'T MISS THIS"
3,Can't agree with the rest,"Although this wasn't the worst book I've read so far this year, it is by no means the best. Yes, I may have learned something about a military court. But there were editorial or writing errors that jumped out at me and couldn't be forgotten. I won't list them all so as not to ruin the book for others, but will say this: Does anyone really believe that no one would follow up on the message the early morning caller was saying? Never pursue it? This could have been better. Much better."
4,Very entertaining.,"I liked this book very much although at times it got technical when dealing with the Military and Lawyers. Other than that, I thought it was well written and definitely kept my attention throughout."
5,WHAT A GREAT WRITER!!!!!!,"High Crimes captures the reader from the very first chapter. The plot is simple -- happy marriage until a past secret is revealed and then all hell breaks loose. Military politics, courtroom drama and an ending that will totally shock the reader. Limited characters make this easy to read. I love the short chapters because it makes it easy to follow. I read Joseph Finder's Paranoia, which is another great book. This is fiction at its very best!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Skip it,"As I continue to search for a good thriller, picked this one and honestly cannot understand the rave reviews. While an interesting idea, it was not well written and the characters were not flushed out. Skip it."
3,Great!... If you leave off the final ending,"If you're a person who likes a strong well written ending, then this will eventually disappoint you. The book is fantastic and I was rivited through the twists and turns and the drama of the court room and up until the last few pages I was thinking this was one of the best Law books I've ever read. Then the very end actualy angered me. All that talent both in the writing by this author and in the development and the intelligence of the main character, all washed out in the end. It doesn't fit the rest of the book at all and that is a real shame."
3,Loved it but has a weak ending,I loved it and thought that it deserved 5 stars until I got to the last dozen pages. The bit with Claire infuriating a known psychopath by insisting on using first her home phone and then her cell to turn him into the police instead of waiting until it was safe to do so was ridiculous. The entire story built her up as being super intelligent and now she's suddenly stupid? A very lazy and unimaginative ending.
2,"Predictable, derivative","Yes, this is a fast read. That's because it reads as if it were an adaptation of a screenplay, rather than the other way around. You can visualize each and every scene as it should appear on the movie screen, and it appears that it was written specifically to be sold to the studios. It's also very predictable. The climax could be seen from miles off, as could several of the events during the story.The book tries to be a cross between Scott Turow (for the legal aspects) and Tom Clancy (for the military parts). In that, it succeeds, but is not as interesting as books by the other two authors. Turow's ""Presumed Innocent"" is better written and has much the same plot and climax twists. I'd recommend reading that book over this one."
4,A Great Read,"Just as I thought there were no good books left to read. This well-written, intellectually stimulating, political-legal thriller is a real page turner.So glad to have discovered J Finder."
3,Just misses,Enjoyed the book for the most part. But it just did not grab me as some of the others did.Worth the read.
4,Oldie but goodie,"In this tense novel, the author sets the stage for a tight courtroom drama which centers around a secret military tribunal. When she believes her husband has been falsely accused of a heinous military atrocity which smacks of the Vietnamese aromaticity at My Lia, lawyer takes on the US army in a secret courts-martial. Her husband stands accused of committing the murder of 187 innocent civilians in Central America.As with other Finder novels there are plots and cross-plots and of course the surprise ending.Written pre-9/11, it is still a gripping tale."
3,"Tight and cinematic but ultimately ""been-there, done that""","This is an ultra-fast and absorbing book, structured more like a film than a novel. And that may be its downfall. It is full of kinetic scenes and dramatic, page-turning chapter endings but - at the end of the day - it is a tired rehash of too many crime/action thrillers that have gone Hollywood (with a anti-military jingoism that becomes absolutely intrusive). It's an admittedly exciting read at times (especially when picturing the cast of the soon-to-be-released movie in the roles; Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman are perfect) but is ultimately too contrived and unbelievable to put it in league with the best crime novels."
3,A really good read!,"The plot twist at the end of this book was great. You almost knew that the story wasn't going to be a straightfoward as you thought, but neither did you know which way it was going to turn. This was the first book I have read by Joseph Finder--I hope his others are as equally engrossing."
1,Pathetic! No Serious Legal Research. Baseless Commentary.,"The most pathetic book I have ever read. It is sinful that the author claims to be legally accurate; vis a vis: ""legal consultants"" in the acknowledgements. The lack of legal research obviates itself. As a federal law enforcement officer, I can tell you with 100% certainty (refering to page 16)that there is no such thing as ""...authorized to kill,"" nor ""...permitted to wound if necessary"". That's what made the Nazis the Nazis. From this point forward, the book revealed its hand in making the following political statement: ""The only true evil is the US Government"". I truely hope that all Americans are embarrassed at the author's feeble attempts at realism (""...authorized to wound"" etc.). The only reason I finished this book is that it was an anniversary present from my wife and she said that I had to. Don't waste your money or time."
1,Displeased,"After reading the book I shared my Kindle to a friend for them to read this compelling story. After many emails and phone conversations the pages to this book refuse to turn without a 15 second delay. The problem still avails, even after rebuying the book. I am very disappointed .... The odd thing, this is the only book that I have ever had any trouble with at all. I shall have to purchase this book in a local book store if my friend wants to finish reading it. The Kindle advisors are stumped as to why this problem happened."
3,A good read but lacks credibility,"I admit it. I read this book in a sitting and a half. But I had to suspend my credibility every page. As one reviewer pointed out, there's no such thing as ""shoot to kill'' and ""shoot to wound.'' There's also no way anyone, even the military, would engage in such obvious deception without someone blowing the whistle. The surprise twist at the end? It was telegraphed pretty early. Oh well, it's still a good book for a plane ride."
5,Fantastic!,"I just got the book from Amazon yesterday and finished it this morning in one sitting. It's really, really great. I hardly ever read thrillers but this one for some reason just took my attention and when I started it I couldn't stop, I loved Claire and her sister Jackie and Grimes. As a working woman and a mom I totally identified with Claire and liked the way she's strong and sexy at the same time, and funny. A totally great character! I liked Tom, her husband, but then I wasn't sure, but I was rooting for them to get there happy lives back. I was totally floored at the end! Everyone who likes suspense novels, or who just likes a good story, should read this book!!"
2,Did not thrill me,"Lured by many acclaim notes in the front and back covers, yet I could not find that spark that gets me trapped to this plot because in this story I have experienced Finder's trademark again, he uses to write serious drama in his books with the depth and times you will find in an afternoon soap opera. The story unfolds like a tale published in the pages of a glossy magazine. The final product is a light fast read suitable for a cross country flight if you don't like the plane magazines"
4,Good Music,When I first got this cd I did not enjoy the music at all.After a couple days though I really started to like it.The first 3 tracks on the cd are great and Move is good also.I highly recommend you to get this cd.
3,EDGG,"It's good, but it is a totally different kind of music than what I expected, I liked Phenomenon a lot better."
3,REALLY GOOD,"DIFFERENT. DON'T COMPARE IT TO PHENOMENON. IT SEEMS TO HAVE A PURPOSELY DIFFERENT SOUND.GOT TO ADMIT THAT THIS RELEASE IS GREAT JUST THE SAME! IT DOESN'T HAVE THE GROOVE AND DRIVE THAT PHEOMENON HAD BUT THEY MAY GET MORE CHART TOPPERS WITH THIS ONE.DON'T BE LOOKING FOR A STRONG MESSAGE OF HOPE IN CHRIST, YOU WON'T FIND IT. ALL IN ALL, I GIVE IT AN 8 OUT OF 10, A MUST FOR YOUR LIBRARY. **** 4 stars.We saw TFK at Kingdombound '04 and they rocked. These new songs will no doubt kick live.."
5,INCREDIBLE.,If you don't already have this CD- You Are Missing Out! This CD is one of the greatest CDs I've ever heard- It is an incredibly balanced disk- nothing short of perfect. THE ART OF BREAKING shows the world that THOUSAND FOOT KRUTCH is an awesome band that knows a thing or two when it comes to making a great rock record.
3,Great Sound... but only a decent CD,"I got this CD and at first listen I loved it. I listened to the CD several times and I wanted to start signing along. That's when I realized the lyrics really aren't that great. The exception is the song ""Absolute"". That song is why I bought the CD and since it is on there I'm not disappointed, the rest of the songs are just OK though. I don't see this CD becoming anyone's favorite very easily, but if you like christian rock it is worth a listen."
2,This is an okay CD,"This CD is oke\ay. Id ont like it that much because it is kinda boring and all of the songs sound alike. Though is I had to have a favorite song on this album I would have to say it was The Art of Breaking, though this still isnt a very goos song."
5,Different from Phenomenon...which shows diversity and growth,"When I first heard this album, I was kinda taken aback because I was basically looking for a repeat of Phenomenon. But the more I've listened to it (and it is quite a bit) the more I like what I hear. The difference from TFK's previous album shows they can grow and mature. This is not to say that their previous albums are less than solid. They are amazing. But when you stick to doing the same songs on every album, then you get old. The Art of Breaking showed me Thousand Foot Krutch isn't gonna get old anytime soon. The music is solid throughout and the lyrics are constantly pushing the listener to something more than partying and head-banging. Suffice it to say, the heart of TFK is in tune with the heart of God. There is so much more than what this world can offfer."
3,It's OK.,"I think this CD is just OK. Phenomenon was way better than this. On this CD they tried to diversify, but nothing seemed to come together for me. There aren't any songs that are too catchy or stand out for me. If you're a devoted fan, you obviously have to buy it, but if you're someone like me who just liked Phenomenon, I would stay away from this one or listen to your friend's copy ;-) ."
2,Farewell TFK.,"*Blech* That's about my summation of this album. Gone are the days of old for TFK when in-your-face rhyming would be wonderfully interlaced with well-placed breakdowns and lots and lots of scratch in the background... Welcome to the new all-too-often-heard recycled rock sound that litters the streets of the music scene today. I just felt like most of the songs sounded the same, and the total absence of all rap was a slap in the face. I could just sense with ""Phenomenon"" that TFK wanted to go a new route with their music (very much like their FM-Static side-group), and sadly my suspicions were confirmed with ""The Art Of Breaking"".It's sad to see yet another one of my favorite bands fall into the music machine of the majority of mainstream bands out there. I don't deny their right as artists to change their style, but I'm not going to be suckered in to liking this album just because I was once a loyal fan...Sorry to say it, but the TFK that once was is now long gone..."
5,Amazing,"This CD is amazing. I got introduced to this band at a friend of mine's house and may I say, this is a lot better than the punk/heavy metal I listen to. I love this band, their songs are amazing and this cd is definitely worth buying.WOW!"
2,This is an okay CD,This CD is okay but definitly not what I was expecting. I was suprised when I bought this Cd to find out that almost all of the songs sound alike. The lyrics are also not that great and they have a weird tune to them. If i had to have a favortie song on this CD it would have to be The Art of Breaking and Absolute because they both sound at least mildly good.
4,Fun Flashback,It felt strange watching this in color but it sure was a fun trip back to memory lane.
3,Shergar,The movie has beautiful scenery and music. After reading about Shergar on the inter net I know that there is hardly a word of truth in the movie. That however doesn't make it less entertaining. I enjoyed it a great deal and wanted to know more about the horse.
3,Basically okay,"This movie, we thought, was okay, but a bit of a snooze-fest.We were looking forward to it being a bit faster paced,and more emotionally charged. The ending was VERY sad,and it just dropped you there...I won't be passing thisone on to friends."
4,Shergar,"This was a very good movie. I did not care so much for the violence, fortunately, it was kept down a bit, but overall, the movie was suspenseful, and the characters believable. I also appreciated that it was not obvious what direction the movie was going in its entirety. Just when I thought one thing was going to happen, something else happened instead. Love that kind of directing. Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie to others. It was entertaining."
1,Based on A True Story my eye...,"Intrigued by the cast including Mickey Roarke and Ian Holm, I bought the videotape of this film for one dollar. I was robbed, I think. ""Based on a True Story"" is the first disappointment. The kidnapping itself is well documented, and this film doesn't even hold to the facts, other than Shergar was taken from the farm. The filmmakers then weave a fantastic and unbelievable tale of what they think happened (complete with human hair dye that doesn't sweat off of a horse, but rinses off completely in the rain), and a preposterous ending where we're not even sure that the horse is dead.And what in heavens happened to Mickey Roarke's face??? Did he have plastic surgery in a strip mall? He looks like Tahlulah Bankhead in male drag (or that he got Angelina Jolie's lips). Ian Holm, as always, is great, but he's not in enough of the movie to make it worthwhile. And, to note, this is definitely NOT a kid's movie. Or an adult's, for that matter. Save your dollar."
4,Horse Tales,"My husband and I are nearing 80 yrs. of age but still enjoy ""going to a movie"" together when we can find a nice clean story or one thats exciting but not full of dirty language etc. This was an interesting tale and held our interest."
4,Review of Cocaine Cowboys,This is a very interesting documentory that focusses on the cocaine culture in Miami in the 1980's. It mainly consists of interviews of the actual people involved. I highly recomend it to any one who is interested in this topic. I really enjoyed it the real people are better than fiction.
3,"Movie is a little over-done,cheap looking,and glorifies scumbags.","Despite being a little over done,sometimes cheap looking film, It glorifies scumbags for instance,You cannot deny that the movie has a great point: Alot of the money went to building Miami.Of course Miami was a sleepy town that could have done without such help,Thank God it's cleaned up now.(Although not enough)."
3,Fare Flick,"This movie was overhyped, you only get face surface nothing that is really insightful. True the editing in this movie was very good, but this movie was not in depth as I thought it would be to much filler, more emphasis should have been placed on the Columbian rackets, Ochoa preferably. The movie has it points but the 2 hours really drags on Munday really was mundane and really never gave you antyhing interesting. The same can be said for the hitman from chicago he should not have been given the reigns to speak so long. Still its worth renting but not purchasing I expected more out of this flick."
1,CHEAPLY MADE JUNK,"Filmed at warhol's vacation home, or somebody's new york area estate---and that's about it for locale.I have this on a cheap double-feature disc; probably cost a dollar at the time, though maybe I paid five dollars through a previous amazon/ebay membership.Mostly talking; all boredom; the opening credits are superimposed over 1970s times square.Warhol is in this movie, but it isnt a Warhol movie; not as though the crew or director from olde 1960s or even early '70s Warhol daze.Warhol, in his published diary, said how Jack Palance took some movies so he could get drunk without any problems....Palance was definately one of very many Hollywood drunks.Palance is in this movie for maybe 40 minutes, Warhol for about ten minutes and mostly in the same room...otherwise a bunch of amateur nobodies in the cast.If you ever saw the bottom of the barrel 1970s horror movie DONT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT---it's as though they took that movie and added some cocaine refernces to it."
4,Unbelievable but True,Fascinating documentaryfilm on the violent world that Miami was during the 1970's and 1980's. It's a must see.
2,Wow this is boring,"This is a great movie if you enjoyed watching film strips in 6th grade. If you pop this baby in your DVD player, you will be asleep within 35 minutes. This movie makes cocaine dealers out to be criminal masterminds, when all they really are is shady, good for nothing bums. This could have been a 1/2 hour special on the History Channel and, you'd get the same amount of useful information. Honestly, if you want to get a good idea of this film...just imagine watching an episode of Miami Vice but, subtract all the action scenes."
5,One of My All-time Favorites,I moved to Miami in 1995 and have been enamored by this incredible city ever since. I have watched this repeatedly and am just blown away by the story and the way it has been told by the directors. A MUST see for all South Florida residents.
4,Captivating and Entertaining,"I don't usually get too wowed by documentaries, but this one is really well done. No matter what your political views are on illegal drugs this story of how the culture and infrastructure of an entire city were transformed by drug trade over a 2 decade period is fascinating. An added bonus is the musical score by Jan Hammer--so aptly matched to the theme and tenor of this movie."
5,Amazing,"I have always been intrigued by Miami in the 70's and 80's and this documentary adds so much to what i already know. it was a directed and produced with style and the footage and pictures were fantastic. The trafficking tales told by John Roberts and Mickey Munday are incredible and i can listen to those for hours on end. The interiew with Rivi was chilling and very revealing about those times and the seeming lawlessness in South Florida. For someone who killed X amount of people, he comes off with a ton of charisma and charm and class. The guys at Ranconteur productions absolutley hit it on the head with this film, an awesome job by them. They have a pt 2 for release soon I believe. What a time...."
1,WACK,IF THIS AINT THE WORST FLICK I EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE?I WAITED MAD LONG FOR IT TO COME OUT AND GOT IT THE DAY IT DID.[$] FOR NOTHING.DONT DO IT TO YOURSELF.
5,works fine for powdered milk,since regular milk is almost $4 a gallon we've switched to powdered milk & this pitcher is good for mixing/pouring.
2,Not as good as Pampered Chef version,"I have owned the Pampered Chef version of this pitcher for over 15 years and love it. I should have stuck with the Pampered Chef. The Rubbermaid pitcher does not even compare. It does not stir the bottom liquid at all and the lid does not stay on. I wish I would have spend the extra money and purchased another Pampered Chef pitcher! Oh well, live and learn!"
5,Good Pitcher!!,"I really like being able to stir the mixture as I am making it. The pitcher is sturdy, and it can actually hold a little bit more than 2 quarts. This is good, because I add the full amount of water, and I'm not be concerned about it spilling over when I mix or even pour my beverage into a glass. The amount is actually etched on the outside of the pitcher so you can see exactly how much liquid needs to added to make a half gallon of beverage. I didn't know that when I purchased it, so this is an added bonus for me. I love this pitcher and I use it often, because it is so much cheaper to make my own diet beverages."
5,useful pitcher,"This does everything you could really want from a pitcher. We use it to make and store sweet tea. I guess long part attached to the top can be used to stir it up if you have ice or lemons or something in it, but we just used it for plain tea. It is easy to wash and doesn't have any major drawbacks."
2,Piece of light junk,"This is made by a good company and I guess it works(you just can't pump up and down swiftly to stir easily)but I have to say it is so cheaply made. Your better of with the Pampered Chef one even though it's more expensive. Like Mom always said ""You get what you paid for"""
3,its ok,"the lid is not very tight & comes up when you plunge the stirrer. its ok for the price, but not my fave."
4,Good Buy,I bought this pitcher to replace another home party brand that I dropped and broke. This Rubbermaid pitcher works just as well for the price. I do need to keep my hand on the top cover when using the stirring plunger or the top tends to lift up. I bought two since you can't beat it for stirring settled orange or tomato juice. The other I use for powdered drink mixes. At least I can't break this one.
4,good pitcher,"This is my first mixer pitcher, and I really like it. It takes a bit of mixing to get something thick like milk to work, but it's not too hard. Also, has enough room for the foam to not get in the way of the mixing process. I like that the mixing wand ""locks"" into place in the lid, so you don't have to worry about it falling out when you pour."
4,Works for me!,"Pros:-clear pitcher, easy to see contents-mixer makes it easy to stir up drink mixes-tall, thin design fits well in my crowded fridgeCons:-Lid is a little loose fitting. It is not at all spill-proof. Turn the full pitcher on it's side or upside down and you will have a large mess on your hands. The lid occasionally comes out when I'm pouring the last little bit out. Most of the time this is not an issue though.Overall, for the price, I'm satisfied."
4,Almost Perfect,What a great product. It's very easy to mix any amount quickly & easily. The only reason I gave it 3 instead of 4 stars is because the lid isn't water/air-tight for storage or tip-overs.
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,This product works o.k. but it isn't as good as I had hoped it would be. Turning the mixer is awkward and I'm not sure it actually mixes anything. I still have to get a spoon out and mix it.
1,Review on the company,"This product may be good, but this company is AWFUL. I ordered this pitcher on July 27. Today is August 17 and I still have not received it. That is ridiculous! I have contacted the company twice and the second time was to cancel the order. The second time they informed me they were shipping the pitcher that day (today). NEVER did they offer free shipping or did they allow me to cancel my order or did they say anything about that - only an excuse as to why the product was taking a long time (they were waiting on the company they get the pitchers from to send a shipment). Go to Walmart, Target, or another place online to order this pitcher. DO NOT order it from this company!"
3,World Language,"to the reviewer who says that every Spanish textbook should emphasize Mexican Spanish, there are many other countries other than Mexico that speak Spanish. It is pure linguistic chauvinism to state that vosotros shouldn't be taught. I also think 'vos' as used in Central American and the River Plate region should also be introduced in beginning Spanish classes. Limiting the accents that are offered and by refining the text as though Mexico were the only country potential Spanish speaker will visit is short-sighted and small-minded at best. The text is not meant to be used on an autodidactic basis."
3,A LONG WAIT FOR PRODUCT,"I ordered this product on the 3rd of August via expedited (2 day)shipping and it did not get here until the 13th of August!! Class started here on the 15th. The product itself was as it stated, so I can not complain about that. I would not use this shipper unless you have plenty of time to wait."
4,Tasty but breaks easily,"I love the texture and flavor of this product. It is not very strong and will easily break, if you put a lot of food on it."
2,Stale tasting,"Product had 4 months to go on date when I received it. Tasted stale. You cannot return this item, so your stuck with 10 boxes of them. $30 down the drain. 2nd food item I've received from Amazon in the last few months that was stale tasting. I think your local grocer is a safer bet for this type food item. That is, if you can find it locally. At least you can try a smaller quantity and return it if neccessary."
5,Excellent product fiber-lishious low-glycemic etc. etc. etc.,"My husband lives on these. He is hungry every few hours and was gaining weight on sourdough bread, chips, et al. He started munching on a couple of these, and he's feeling great. They keep him going, and sometimes he adds a slice or two of cheese. They are crisp and yummy and healthy. What more?"
4,Wilton 21004 Columbian 4 inch X 7inch Woodworkers Vise,"I have only used this vise a couple of times and so far it has performed up to my expectations. I was pleased to find out that the package contained the magnetic hardwood jaw inserts (these were a $30.00 option in another catalog I shopped in). The only problem I have with this item is that the name WILTON is clearly visible on the vise body in the Amazon ad. photo but the vise I received had no indication on the vise that it was a Wilton vise, only the packaging and instructions contained the Wilton name. I guess only time will tell if this vise will live up to the Wilton name or if I received a substandard imitation."
3,mistaken identity,"shows two vises: this one appears to be the WHM 21004 Columbian; there is also a similar, a very nice Wilton 78 vise. The Wilton 78C (without quick release interrupted screw) is $10 more here on Amazon. I just received mine and it is beautiful -- can't wait to mount it to the bench. Does not include wood faces."
5,Wilton 21004 Columbian 4-Inch x 7-Inch Woodworkers Vise,This is an excellent woodworking vise and I chose it carefully to complete my custom built wood-working bench. This vise is an excellent value and its features are equal or better than all the others. The quick release feature is especially nice. My wood working shop and bench are the envy of all my friends and this vise is an essential part of it.
4,Almost perfect,This is a great little headphone. Did not want the microphone so I cut it off and put a dab of glue on the cut and it did not hurt a thing. Also the cord is TOO LONG. Well worth the price though.
4,Philips headset SHM3100/37,This product works very well with both desktops and laptops. The cable is long enough for usage. It seems a very good choice for online chat.
4,"Good sound, but the microphone is easily obscured.","For the price, these earbuds are about as good as it gets; much better, in fact the $25 set I originally bought to use with Skype. I have often found it necessary, however, to hold the microphone up to my mouth to be heard."
4,Excellent product,"Great product: small, sound quality is good, cable long, microphone works well.Just two things missing: volume control and good carrying case (this is a laptop set after all, c'mon Phillips). I hope the manufacturer is reading these reviews and will do something about this product.Other than that - it is a great value for the money."
5,Works perfect,"These earbuds are small and compact, and sound and voice are great. I would strongly suggest them."
3,Limited Usefulness,"This product is helpful only for those planning a short weekend trip by private vessel from So. Cal. to Ensenada. It covers nothing past Ensenada, which limits its usefulness. VERY narrow in scope."
3,"Some Good, Some Bad","I purchased this case for the $40 full price at CompUsa; that's rather pricey but better than the other choices they had.The Good: The outer case is sturdy, and the leather sleeve for the Nano is great; it stays on quite well and doesn't interfere with any of the iPod functions.The Bad: There really isn't room in the case for earbuds, let alone the cord to sync to iTunes. And the protective film? IMO it's junk! The one that came with my purchase wouldn't curve around the edges so it didn't make a good seal at the vertical edges and didn't make a smooth cover with no bubbles over the window. It didn't stay on, with the edges catching on everything. When I complained, they sent me another shield, but it had the same problem. I tossed both of them."
3,Good purchase for the price,"I just needed something to protect my iPod from scratches so this definitely works. However, it's slightly off and the wheel isn't quite centered. I thought that the leather would have some give but no such luck thus far. Also, I have nails so this isn't a huge problem for me but putting the iPod on hold and taking it off can be a little challenging.I would recommend this product if it's under $20."
4,Nice little toaster oven,"After reading other reviews of this product, I was a bit concerned about purchasing this toaster oven, but for price and style it couldn't be beat. And after receiving it, I couldn't be happier my toaster oven. For toasting, reheating and keeping things warm, this is a great toaster oven! And it looks super cute sitting out in my kitchen! I haven't tried baking, but think this would work great for a small batch of cookies (assuming they need to cook at 350) but I have an oven - this is just an accesory. Great product, great price, great style - what more do you need?"
2,Broiler doesn't work,"However, I paid only $19.95 for it and only use for toasting french bread. Other than that, it's not worth more than what I paid."
3,No Temperature Control for Baking!,"I was very surprised to unwrap my new toaster oven & find no temperature control for baking! I used my oven thermometer to check out what the temp gets to - 350 - and that's the only temp you can use for baking (My old toaster oven had settings just like a regular oven).However, it is a beautiful toaster oven & looks good on my counter - so will just use it for toast!"
2,BUYER BEWARE,"I've been disappointed with this purchase. The rack has two levels which it is cranky about changing. Because they do not easily slide, I find myself trying to brace against the hot surface of the oven. It also makes the handle provided difficult to use, and therefore it is too easy to burn yourself. There is no temperature setting -- it's either ""bake on"" or ""bake off."" Although I've had better luck with toast than the previous reviewer, I have the same situation with broil. I feel that goes beyond weird -- it's the opposite of broil!"
2,They don't make 'em like they used to,"I didn't think it would be so hard to find a replacement for an old toaster oven. This is the second one we bought and returned (first was B&D). Same problems; basically, the timer is ineffective (doesn't 'ding' when toast is ready). We're not asking for any bells and whistles, just something that makes toast, bagels, rolls, etc. If someone finds a good one for under $50, please recommend."
2,Could not wait to replace this toaster with a different one,"1. Toaster oven never toasted bread evenly.2. I did not feel the temperature was ever high enough to cook meat or chicken without drying it too much.3. The time handle broke very soon after I started using the product.4. The outside was virtually impossible to clean. I have a lot of stainless steel appliances large and small - have no problem cleaning those and shining with Windex, but this toaster seems to attract the dirt and grease and not let go of it. The spots then turn brown with heat, of course and the toaster looks old and ugly after a year of use.5. Same goes for the glue trace rectancle from the warning sticker on top - I was not able to remove all of it so it turned brown with time. Perhaps I should have used Goo-Gone.I am only giving this product 2 stars instead of 1 because it did get me through a year of warming up sliced frozen bread and pizza."
4,They work,these are everything I needed so should I say more than that?? I guess I needed 6 more words so I added this sentence.
3,Not worth 20 dollars,"Isn't worth the price, the sections on mantra and meditation are good. You might as well buy conversations with Muktananda it's more thorough."
5,markluck22,"In my opinion, most all reviews found in this posting, and those evaluation offered, are in step with the horror and insanity of the War in Vietnam. I retired from the Army after having served 23 years in uniform. Enough said."
4,An informative memoir on the Vietnam War,This memoir brought me closer than I had been before to the Vietnam War..it was interesting. Another perspective on the Vietnam War.
3,Deserved more thought,"I have not read anything else of O'Brien's but I will. I am intrigued. This book was apparently written in the time between his combat experience and coming home. It perfectly reflects the angst many of us went through, though many of us didn't have to plan the trip to Toronto and probably would not have at any rate. Just like Tim. Maybe he's written a more thoughtful book about the war and his experience. I'll check it out."
3,Good Read but Not His Best,"Tim O'Brien is an excellent war author. This is only the second book I have read of his but I do enjoy the insight to military life and war. There were a few things I did not like. I could be bias because I read this book during a deployment but I was not big on the antiwar talk. I felt cheated out of a good war book after hearing so much of it. But none the less, O'Brien is an excellent author. His characters are round and he pulls you into each scene with vivid description and honest dialogue. This book is literature."
1,Could not finish reading,"This book is so boring, you will probably throw it in your fireplace before you finish the first chapter. If i had to re-read this book, i'd probably go blind from boredom."
1,If I die in a combat zone box me up and send me home,"One of the biggest disappointments I have read recently. If you get a chance read a sample before purchasing, I wish I had. If you remove all the fluff and quotes, from great people, theirs not much left. The author spends much of his writing skills putting down the common grunt an placing himself well above those, not so bright, lowlifes he served with. The only part that I could agree with about this book is that he probably should have gone to Canada to avoid the draft."
4,More on the art than on making the paper...,"Wow - talk about the variety of art projects now available with paper - this book covers them all in moderate depth. I would not recommend this boot for a focus on paper making, but if you are an art teacher and paper is realatively cheap (depending on type and quality), this is a great book and the projects can be adapted to a classroom setting. I have to admit, it did give me ideas useful for for modifying my own handmade papers. I do wish more depth was given to the book on paper making and even on some of the paper art projects - but for the price, it is an excellend deal choice for the many aspects of paper and art. So expand your horizons with paper design projects and get this book!"
2,Not unless you are a Fred Couples fanatic.,This is not very good for the new age golfer. I like to watch Fred Couples swing as much as anyone. This video is not good for anyone seriously trying to create a fundamental swing. There is alot of emphasis on tempo of course but not enough other info to really get a good score.
4,Definitely Comes In Handy,"The new edition has more words and updated signs. As ASL does have different dialectics depending on what part of the country you're in, this book does a nice job of at least giving you the general idea of how to do a sign. The descriptions are easy to follow and understand."
3,A bit too basic,"Well, I have a few ASL dictionaries, take ASL courses and also have DVD/CD's to practice with at home with. I thought this book would be a plus, but I find it too basic. I think because I'm past the beginning level. Well, this is how it is for me, but I know that someone who is begining will get something out of it. Although, if you are going to learn ASL to be fluent, this book will only be a good reference for a short period of time."
1,Too small,"While this book is a great idea (you look up signs by their shape) there aren't many signs in the book so almost all the signs I've tried to look up were not in there and I eventually stopped trying. I thought that I would find this book incredibly useful, but because of how few signs there are in the book it has not helped me at all, nor did it help my friend whom I gave the book to (he gave it almost immediately back to me). I do not recommed this book at all."
2,Outdated,"This book was published in 1994, prior to the internet boom. It covers telephone, mail, and face-to-face surveys. It doesn't cover email surveys or internet-based surveys. It also fails to mention scaling or data-types. If you're looking for ideas on questions, or are concerned about sampling techniques, you'll find some info here. This is one of those ""partial references"": it covers some things, but leaves enough out that you'll need to buy another reference to compliment it. If you're looking for the latest in survey methodology, this book doesn't have it."
3,Good price...handle with care,"I machine washed one of these on delicate and it fell apart. When I contacted the company, it said they were not meant to be washed, only surface cleaned. I did have success when I had to do more than surface clean by soaking in a sink and air dry.Be prepared to mend with superglue. The seams/zippers are bonded with heat, so they are not that secure. Small holes/tears occur, but can be repaired with superglue. Other than that, they are a bargain."
1,"Blah, blah blah, boring....","Review by Tyler Wagnon:Album opener ""The Beginning of the Apocalypse"" is a dramatic, synth-lead track that would have most convinced they were in for a theatrical black metal album. Instead, we get boring melodic death metal tinged with metalcore.If a band isn't going to be even slightly original, they have to be good at what they do and try to bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, Slowmotion Apocalypse is average at best and brings absolutely no new ideas into the fold. They play solidly enough, but nothing stands out whatsoever.Anyway, expect the usual dual guitar harmonies, tremolo picked rhythms, thrashy drumming, and generic hardcore vocals. Again, solid, but nothing is worth commenting on. Blah, blah, blah... boring."
3,Hard to Rad History,"This book is hard to read. The author's style is very sophisticated. There's too much uncommon vocabulary that is difficult to discern in context (i.e. it has to be looked up). The author seems to like long, complicated sentences. I found myself reading much stuff repeatedly before I could get it. As far as telling a story, the book assumes more knowledge of the Western Migration than I bring as a reader. Much of what might have put the story in context for me, is intentionally left out. This book is probably more appropriate for a trained historian."
1,Jaded Historian's Viewpoints,"If you want to read a book which has been written by someone who hates the Latter Day Saints, then this is the book for you. This author has crossed the bridge between being factual and being a zelot bigot. I was raised not to bash anyone's religion, but I guess that was not the case with this bitter old man."
5,I AM IMPRESSED!,"What could be better, Alvin Lee slowed down to a musically understandablepace, and The King's side men sped up to a musically enjoyable pace, whowould of thunk it! I look at this CD-""In Tennessee"", with my ears, andfind no fault. Talk about one of those 70's super groups, thisunasunming but unbelivealbly good CD puts them to shame, not a note outof place, every muscian knew where they were going, and the flow of thealbum was as mighty as the mississippi right up to the end. What an endto the CD, ""I'm Going Home"", oh fellow babies, you could compare it tothe Ten Years After version, and be hard pressed to choose between themfor the best one. This is a must buy CD if you like well producedRock/Country fusion with musicians that have a feel for the music, andarn't affraid to play it."
5,alvin lee you da man,"what else can you say this guy can weild an axe,come on down under and let our ears bleed."
2,The new Alvin Lee CD,"OK, maybe I'll be the only one here but I really don't like this new Alvin Lee CD.I understand that Alvin Lee was very happy to record this album with Moore and Fontana, but people like me (in fact, I'm not the only one !) are really disappointed. I've heard hundred times the same kind of music and this CD is not the best one ! To be totally honest, I think this is the WORST Alvin CD I've ever heard !This is only the opinion of an old fan... Old and sad..."
2,"Useful, but Incomplete.","I was overjoyed when I first got this guide. I love the Vendetta game, but wanted to know more about how to play: the combos, movelists, etc. The problem with the guide is it is rushed. It gives the button strings for the combos, but no real detail on how to get the best results. It has bios for the all fighters, and listings of their specific combos, but still, no advice on things like timing and positioning, necessary details to get the combo to work. Also, there isn't a complete movelist, let alone one for every character. I'm thankful for the guide and the information it has, but it didn't meet my expectations of detail for the price I paid. Much like the game itself, the guide has some of what you need, but not the depth to truly satisfy."
4,For Advanced Students,"This book has an excellent assortment of literary excerpts beginning at the pre-Colombian period. I recommend it for the advanced Spanish student because the old Spanish is hard to understand, as is some of the vocabulary. This book gives good explanations of history, culture, as well as literature from Latin America. If you are up to a challenge, I recommend this book for students interested in learning more about Latin American history."
4,Clamp Light,This item worked for my intended usage. I don't think the ad specified the suggested usable wattage but when I received it the lamp stated 60 watt bulb max. I'm using it for a 200 watt bulb in short durations.
5,This is it ! Brainsmashing Future-Primitive Roots,"I've looked long and hard to find a solid modern dub album or compilation....most are weak or miss the point by being too modern. This album hits the bullseye. Solid heavy mix, lots of brainsmashing echo, enough modern effects to keep it fresh, and solidly connected to the roots ya love....Tubby, Scratch, LKJ, Rockers.Some stuff is totally connected to the bass, drums, horns old school Rasta roots...a few of the cuts are excellent modern Tosca-stylee.The new school finally ""gets"" it...and at least its available through more than just total underground or local channels.Hit the bid. Raspect. One love."
5,Another Amazing title by Guidance Recordings,"Wow, this one is even better than the 1st! Parts of it distinctly sound like Tosca's Opera, while other parts are more reminiscent of K & D. Overall a very smooth and chillin sound, that definetely keeps me coming back. Great atmospheric music, and good pumped up, too."
5,Hi-Fidelity Dub Sessions: Chapter Two,"Guidance Recordings returns with the second volume in this acclaimed series showcasing the very best in modern dub music. Hi-Fidelity Dub Sessions: Chapter 2 is an inspired collection of future roots riddims featuring contributions from DJ Spooky, Uptight Productions, Jah Warrior, I:Cube, Indian Ropeman and more. The heavyweight sounds on this album fuse technology with time honored tradition to deliver the Jamaican artform know as dub music safely into the 21st Century. The subtropical selection will appeal to reggae purists as well fans of the dubwise sounds of trip hop, drum and bass and ambient. Its true what dem say "" The sounds sweeter through the echo chamber!"""
3,I bought the CD for one track... the rest is slowly growing on me.,"You can't find this on iTunes (at least right now). I heard the song ""Ay Ay Ay"" on Pandora. I went ahead and bought the CD since I couldn't find the complete album on iTunes. After listening to it a few times... it didn't really move me one way or the other. It's good 'background noise' while your doing things around the house. I have a feeling its one of those albums that you listen to it one day... it's ok. A while from now I'll rediscover it to realize that it's really grown on me. Until that happens... I'm only giving it a 3-star review."
3,Decent enough for what it sets out for,"This is pretty much a vehicle to show off Bo Derek, and it accomplishes that. As an added bonus, there's Olivia d'abo in a nice bathing scene......if you're a fan of either of them then the VHS is worthwile, if not - get something modern, you heathen :-)"
3,"Hunky male co-stars a definite plus, but ...","This movie is mediocre. Not real good, not real bad. I watch it for the hunky Scotsman and the hunky Spaniard. The Scotsman has a very seductive voice, and isn't bad looking; the Spaniard looks like Hugh Jackman. The Arab sheik, forget. One of the characters was right when they said he could pass as 'your sister' - too pretty to be a real man.The sets were nice, the locations were fabulous. Weak, almost non-existent plot. The best thing for me was seeing the nude male co-stars, and I do wish there had been more emphasis on that, and also the sideline romance between the Scotsman and the Spanish woman. Got a good laugh when the Arab sheik made a kidnapping attempt.Just my female viewpoint."
2,GREAT HORSES!!!!,Movie is horrible but horses are FABULOUS! This is some of the best footage of the fabled Andalusian Horses I've ever seen - if there's more out there somebody please let me know! Bought the movie just to see the horses.
5,Can't say enough good things about this product!,"R Lipoic Acid is an amazing product. It has helped me in ways I could have never imagined, including blood sugar levels, eye sight, sleeping better, more balanced physical system. I've taken alpha lipoic acid, but now that I am taking the R lipoic acid, I will never look back. It is incredible the positive affects it has had in my life."
3,"Very expensive, but it is what it says it is.","This is a very stable form of ALA, necessary if you don't want to lose your product to polymerization (spoiling basically).I can tell the difference between this and my regular ala, this is powdery and soft, but my other ala is plasticky and sticky, obviously spoiled.The amount you get for the price you pay though... I just don't know that it's worth it. If you're sold on ALA supplementation, then you're getting your money's worth. If you have your doubts, well, I don't know. Read some medical journals and decide for yourself whether it's worth it.I personally won't be buying again, but I do think it's a good product. I just have other supplements that I have to spend money on, and this just cuts into my budget too much."
4,Good stuff,"I love Doctor's Best brand. I researched and found that the R alpha lipoid acid is many more times potent than just alpha lipoid acid so I only take one where I was taking 3 or 4 of the regular. I am taking it for blood sugar levels, neuropathy in my feet.I have no side effects at all. Wonderful product."
5,really helps his hands,"my hubby has diabetes and the nurapathy really has been a problem, he started taking these pills, and it has made a huge difference for him!"
2,Didn't do anything for me,"This was recommended to me, but I found regular, and cheaper, Alpha Lipoic Acid to be more effective for me, personally."
4,Best price for veg Na-RALA,"Best price for Stabilized R-Lipoic Acid Na-RALA, 100 mg, 60 Veggie Caps available on internet as far as i know, but the only bad thing that it is available only in 100 mg."
3,Contrary to what others have said...,"I had much more energy with 600 mg of Natrol ALA and my neuropathy cleared within one week. With this, I can still feel it mildly. It also constipates me, where the ALA was not so severe in this respect. After I finish this, it's back to Natrol ALA 600 mg twice a day for me."
2,Didn't work for me,"The reviews on this product seemed fine, it's just that the product didn't work for the pain I have associated with my peripheral neuropathy."
3,Dr. Best R-lipoic acid with bioenhanced Na-RALA,I read the reviews and I purchased this for my diabetic mother because I hoped it would help. After several month she said it wasn't making a difference.
4,great reference tool,"This is a detailed and interesting book about dinosaurs for kids. It's very up-to-date. It has dinosaurs we've never heard of before. Who knew that there was a dinosaur for every letter of the alphabet? Now we know! In the starting of the book there are very informative sections such as How Are Dinosaurs Discovered?, How are they named?, How are they grouped?, and what is a dinosaur!The book was very easy for children to use. Lots of kids are interested in learning more about dinosaurs and this is a great tool for themThis book would be helpful to elementary students when writing reports on Dinosaurs."
4,Safe choice for beginners,"I am an intermediate adult saxophone student, and started studying with a rental Yamaha YTS23 tenor saxYamaha YTS23 Tenor Saxophonethat came with a 4C mouthpiece. Suffice it to say, your mouthpiece has more to do with how your sax sounds that the horn itself! For the beginning student, it is difficult to try out mouthpieces unless you have a local music store that will allow you to test-drive different ones. If you or your student gets a chance to test-drive multiple mouthpieces, you will see that this is true. By the time I purchased my own horn, I had the chance to try out 6-8 several different mouthpieces and selected a different brand that worked better for me, but I am sure I will get other mouthpieces as I evolve as a player. Whether you use it for a short time, or keep it forever, the 4C is a good basic mouthpiece that worked for me and is a heck of a bargain for $20."
2,does not come with all the pieces,i got this for my daughter and my never having to buy one before thought i would get the cover and clamp thing(never played don't know what it's called) i was not so happy to find just the one piece.
4,No mixed emotions about this one,"The Stones finally make up and get back together, and they instantly turn out their best album since Tattoo You. For once they actually all seem committed to sounding like the Stones again, and while there's a few throwaways (Terrifying, Hold On To Your Hat, Break The Spell), there's a handful of instant classics: Mixed Emotions, Rock And A Hard Place, the gorgeous soul ballad Almost Hear You Sigh, Keith's hilarious Can't Be Seen and rather lovely Slipping Away, and the out of left field Continental Drift, which returns to Satanic Majesties territory and effortlessly melds world music beats with the power of the band at its best. For once the backing musicians -- keyboaards and harmony vocalists -- augment the sound, not overwhelm it. If there's a weak spot it's Charlie Watts, strangely enough, who turns in some oddly perfunctory drumming. Steel Wheels is no five-star classic, but it's pretty damn solid with plenty of sparks and well worth picking up."
5,Back On Track,"After the abomination that was Dirty Work, the Stones bounced back with their best album since Tattoo You, Steel Wheels. After the listless effort on Dirty Work, the band seems re-energized and play with passion and vigor. ""Sad Sad Sad"" opens the album with a bang and ""Mixed Emotions"" has raw power. ""Hold Onto Your Hat"" sounds like something that could been recorded in 1965. ""Rock And A Hard Place"" is a bit too slick, but Keith Richards smoothes things out with his rollicking ""Can't Be Seen"". ""Almost Hear You Sigh"" is one of the band's best ballads as Mick Jagger sings it in an almost whisper. ""Continental Drift"" finds the band in a world beat sound and ""slipping away"" is a strong closer for the album. Steel Wheels showed the band still could produce a great product when they put in the effort."
5,Great Stones Album.,"This is an awesome album because while it maintains the classic Stones sound that fans love, it also shows a more artistically progressive version of the band, successfully strecthing out beyond their musical comfort zone."
4,Very Good Late Work,"With the exception of tracks 4,5 and 11, all of the songs on this album are very good and I wonder why ""Flashpoint"", the live tour release, doesn't contain more of them."
3,so 80's brassy and sporty,"Threw this on the player the other night. A lot of sound & fury and not much content. I like the Keith songs better on his solo record; Jagger's ideas just confound things. There are three fines tracks on here, though: Jagger's disarming 'Blinded by Love', and a couple of Keith Richards' romancers, the surprisingly creative ""Can't Be Seen"" and ""Almost Hear you Sigh"", a faux soul weeper which must have been an outtake from ""Talk is Cheap"" (because Steve Jordan gets a composer credit). For all the talent working on this disk it's pretty thin. No great single and nothing I remember them playing live nine years later."
4,Far from disgraceful,"The bio for the Stones from Rough Guides calls Steel Wheels a disgraceful effort, don't let that fool you. I bought this CD on the strength of the single 'Rock and a Hard Place', and on the stength of only hearing the chorus! This song has that some funky sound as 'Start me Up.' There are at least 5 very good songs here that make this purchase worthwhile. 'Almost hear you sigh' is a great slow song, as well as 'Terrifying' (I love this part of the song: ""I get these strange strange strange desires"") 'Mixed Emotions' and 'Continental Drift'. Very good effort from Mick and the boys!"
4,Not classic but very good,"This is a solid Stones album. Not their best, but certainly not their worst like my fellow critic professes (that goes to ""Satanic"".) Great mixture of slow and fast tunes. Keith Richards really shines on this record, ""Can't be Seen"" and ""Slipping Away"" are among his best and rival ""Happy"" from ""Exile."" Only weak songs are ""Continental Drift"" and ""Hold On to Your Hat."" I bought this album, and glad I did."
5,This would be a Career High For Any Other Band,"This was the first Stones album I ever heard. I was 18 when it was released and I've been a huge fan ever since.After this I investigated the rest of their catalogue and having discovered the classics from the 60s and 70s I kind of forgot about this one.I just streamed it on Spotify and it's lost nothing for me over 20 years. It still sounds fresh and exciting.For just about any other band this would be an artistic peak.I actually prefer this to the bloated ""A Bigger Bang""."
2,shrug,"the stones recorded a number of straight blues during these sessions, like ""fancy man blues"" and ""cook cook blues"", and the album would be a lot better if they had been included instead of four of the lesser tracks. as it stands, this is a decent impersonation of a rock and roll band, and it sounds like it was recorded in a bank."
4,It's About The Songs,"Steel Wheels is much maligned these days because of its polish I guess. Actually, there's some great songwriting to be found on such tracks like Almost Hear You Sigh, Slipping Away, Mixed Emotions, Hearts For Sale, etc.... There's also a spirit of adventure on Continental Drift and a burst of Exile On Main Street-like fury on Sad Sad Sad. All around, this is a wonderfully complete set from the latter day Stones. This is much better than any of the other latter day Stones post Undercover. Go ahead and give it try, it's worth the listen!"
5,Stones Best Album Since Some Girls,"This is an excellent album. One hit after another on this CD. The Stones really had it all together on this one. The vocals and lyrics are great. The music is inspired and hard driving. The sound quality is superb. Keith Richards does a great job with his song I Just Can't Be Seen With You, which is one of my favorites off this album, along with the lite rocking Almost Hear You Sigh. Mixed Emotions and Rock And A Hard Place are stones classics. This is a very solid album with no album fillers."
4,Rollin' On!,"I always wished they did a song called ""Steel Wheels"" but that's another matter. It's not quite the comeback it was hyped as, partly because the Stones were never as bad as the press said and partly because although some of the first side rocks it isn't quite classic Stones. But the 2nd side with 2 Keef songs, and 4 superb songs with Mick on vocals help retrieve the album from a shakey first side. A lot of people will point out that the first side rocks, and it does, but sometimes it sounds a little under-inspired. ""Rock And A Hard Place"" is better than any of them."
3,Mick's emotions,"Half the songs here are very good, and the other half are very forgetable. After recently listing to this album for the first time in a few years, I was surprised to find that the song I liked best was sung by Keith, ""Slipping Away"". Another song that is surprisingly good is ""Continental Drift"", which gains extra depth by featuring Moroccan and African instruments. Of course, the album also includes the chart hits ""Mixed Emotions"", ""Rock and a Hard Place"" and ""Almost Hear You Sigh"". This album doesn't rank up there with the Stones' classics, but it's not a total bomb, either."
3,Two Great Songs,"This highly touted album was generally favorably reviewed by the critics, but there are quite a few filler songs here, obviously recorded in a rush without much thought behind them. The last three songs here are all wastes, the instrumentals are fine, but Mick sounds forced and bored. Even Charlie's usually cohesive drumming falters on a few tracks, which is shocking considering Watt's steady beat, always the backbone of the group.However, the one strong suit here are two great Stones rockers in their old style, ""Mixed Emotion,"" and ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"" which is by far their best cut since ""Start Me Up."" A fine song, sung with punch and verve by Mick. The live versions of both these songs were awesome. These songs alone make the album worth buying, but you probably won't listen to the other tracks more than once."
4,Their best in the eighties!,"Not only their best album in the eighties,but one of their most inspired albums ever,'Steel Wheels'was the last album featuring Bill Wyman on bass.Great ecclectic rock'n'roll on this album with no signs of aging from the band:check out 'Almost Hear You Sigh'one of the best songs of their career.The only problem is with the critics:they see this band as an institution,and therefore anything that bears the Stones label after,let's say,1976,gets jaded reviews.Their music is not jaded-the problem is with the reviewers!"
4,Keep These Wheels Rolling!!,"Steel Wheels is the best release of the Rolling Stones' 80's material. It was also their last great album. ""Voodoo Lounge"" was good, but this was a lot better. The music is alive and rocking more than ever. The guitar riffs and hooks are insanely perfect here. ""Mixed Emotions"", which was a big hit, is a classic hit single. ""Rock And A Hard Place"" is no exception either. ""Dance Dance Dance"" is pretty lightweight, but it sounds like classic Stones. ""Terrifying"" has a great melody and is very listenable. ""Continental Divide"" was a nice experiment, but it seems half baked. It kind of slows the album down. Even if this was the debut album in present day, it would be a great debut. This is a solid release from the guys. Essential release from the guys."
4,Good condition,"I consider it must for my library as there are some nice cuts on here that are never played on the radio. I especially like ""Hearts for Sale"" A bluesy number that is worth the cost of a CD"
5,Steele Wheels / The Rolling Stones,This is the Stones most over looked Recording and I think it istheir very Best. This was from Their Tour of the same name andWhat a Concert it wasm The Best. I have beeen a Fan since Viet Man.David
1,Their Absolute Worst,Avoid this album at all costs. Out of twelve songs only two or three even stand out a little. This album epitomizes what was wrong with the late 1980's music scene. The overall production of this disc is too programmed with way too many synthesizers and annoying backround vocals. Continental Drift sounds like a piece created in outer space WHERE ROCK N ROLL DOES NOT EXIST!!! As a matter of fact whats missing from this record is a solid dose of good old rock n roll. I can not understand for the life of me how the first reviewer could consider this trash a Five Star Album! Five Stars is for Classic Recordings Only. This disc wouldn't make a classic frisbee with its dull gray logo.
1,"Oh no, not the Rolling Stones again !",They are big only because they were one of the first Rock'n'Roll band.Their music is poor and so is the vocals. Poor band making poor music !
1,AT LEAST BILL WYMAN JUMPED SHIP AFTER THIS!,"I HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO BILL WYMAN-AT LEAST AFTER THIS HE HAD ENOUGH CLASS TO CALL IT QUITS. IT WOULD ONLY HELP THE BANDS LEGACY IF THEY TOO, WOULD SEE THE LIGHT. WHY IT TAKES THEM SO LONG TO RECORD A ALBUM IS A MYSTERY SINCE ITS THE SAME REDUNDANT STUFF ,OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AT ONE TIME, THESE GUYS PUT OUT SOME GOOD STUFF, BUT WE ALSO HAD PRESIDENTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH NAMES LIKE JOHNSON AND NIXON AT THE SAME TIME!DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SEARCH OUT SOME EARLY TITLES BY THESE GUYS,YOU WONT BELIEVE IT'S THE SAME GROUP!"
2,The interesting facts are not worth the wait.,"Although there are interesting facts about life in the Sixteenth Century, they are few and far between in this book. Probably a good doctorial thesis, this is a tedious, at times redundant, read"
4,A Must Read,"You're probably thinking that menopause can't happen to you. You're wrong. This book is a must for anyone who is going through menopause, knows someone going through menopause, has been through menopause, thinks about going through menopause, has dreamt about menopause, will not go through menopause, has gone through menopause in a previous life, or sells menopause related products or is in the coping with menopause business in anyway. Menopause is, among many things, preventable; with the right knowledge, care, and planning one may prevent menopause outright. this book outlines the three main treatments for menopause, being a man, becoming a man, and pre menopausal fatality. It offers pros and cons to each treatment and displays them in an easy to read graph."
4,great for the money,got this mixer as a wedding gift. so far it's held up great (had it almost two years now). my only complaint is that the slowest speed still seems a bit fast sometimes. i love the flat base to stand it up without making a mess all over the counter and i love the dough hooks.
3,nice unit but poor beaters,"I've owned this unit only 2 years, and the beater has busted and I'm disappointed because it was a decent mixer, it could handle all the stiff dough and has a flat solid base so it doesn't tip over when I set it down."
1,Dangerous - Do Not Buy!,"I purchased this because I thought it would be a good fryer - held a lot of food in the basket,no nonstick coating inside (which is unhealthy if it gets hot), had a lid, and was easy to store. I used it about a couple of months - I fry fish alot and used it about every other week. I was concerned about the steam that came around the corners and got the control panel wet, even though I made sure the lid was on well. Then one day it got very hot and showed an error message. It scared me because it could have caught on fire - it was that hot. The grease was smoking and black as tar. The clip also fell off that the basket rested on when lifted. I tried to be very careful to not let it happen by constant monitoring, but it happened again about a year later (out of warranty of course). This time it did not come back on - it burned up. I would not recommend this fryer."
1,"Big dissapointment,","takes forever to see the green 'Ready' light on. Even the light did not come on from the second time. Also the temperature was not reached enough to fry some small cubes of chicken. I did not buy this toy to fry potatos only! Customer service is horrible as well. I found the company's website, www. euro-pro.com, and there were only some cleaners displayed, no kitchen items. I called customer service, and the employees gave me another number(1-800-361-3649) for kitchen items service, but the line was always busy - I tried at least 6 times!! I don't want to give even one star to rate this item and the company's customer service."
1,Unit Failed After Limited Use,"The concept of a standalone deep fryer is the way to go. It's much better than trying to get the oil to the desired temperature on the stove top. However, this unit is not the one to buy. It worked great for about 6 months, then it started switching on and off by itself during cooking. Now it won't come on at all. Customer service at Euro-Pro is useless. Their web site has a search box for you to enter the model number. I did and it says there is no such model. It's out of warranty, so I have no interest in throwing good money after bad. This thing will end up on the junk heap. In short, not recommended. Save your money. Buy something else."
1,Works for a Month,This product worked for a month or so (used it at most 4 times) and then simply stopped working. Will not power on. Peice of Junk.
1,Piece of J-U-N-K!,"I agree with all those who have written great reviews for this product - if your only rating this on the ""out of the box"" experience. It is a great fryer, until it stops working! We've had ours for about 10 months and have used it about 1x per month. Then last night, in the middle of the meal preparation it suddenly stopped working all together. It just stopped - no lights, no heat, no warning.... nothing???I work in engineering so I took it appart to see if it could be easily repared; it could not. This is one of those items that looks good on the outside, but when you look at the guts it is very cheaply made. It now is a permanent resident of our local landfil."
1,Piece of Junk,"The product worked for about 6 weeks. Then one day, it started making this high pitched noise and the display became unreadable. Nothing we did would fix it. It ceased working. I have since learned that many have had similar experiences. I've heard that it's some problem with the wiring, and the company will fix it but you have to ship it to them and pay for the shipping (both there and back). This company also makes sewing machines and vacuums, but I would not buy any of their products."
2,Not as advertised,"I purchased the Euro-Pro based largely upon these reviews.The unit holds 4 liters of oil NOT 5 as advertised. Unless, of course, one is supposed to overfill past the max line.The thermostat only reads to 375 degrees NOT 400 degrees, it is also not very accurate.The thermal shut-off switch has turned the unit off everytime I have used it. Soggy french fries and delays whilst waiting for the unit to reheat.The heating 'on' light is not very bright and impossible to see from the side. Hence the soggy french fries.Bed bath and beyond have a 4 liter Krups for $89.99 with a 20% off coupon that was going to be my first choice. These reviews convinced me otherwise. BAD choice!Caveat Emptor"
2,Disappointed,"I received this item as a gift this year. My last deep fryer died after 5 faithful years of service. I used the Euro-Pro deep fryer probably a maximum of 5 times within 6 months, and it died. I have always taken good care of all of my kitchen appliances, and was really disappointed that this brand of deep fryer did not last long. I would never buy another Euro-Pro product as it seems (from my research) that their appliances are not quality."
4,So Far So Good,"Fryer worked like a charm. Easy to use. Accurate temps and cook times. A breeze to clean and re-assemble. It's brand new and near perfect, so we're still honeymooning.Only suggestion is the gauge of outer cabinet stainless seems a bit flimsy but nonetheless provides good support for the oil container. I compared this Euro Pro unit (reviews and physical comparison) with another more recognizable name brand stainless fryer that did not offer as many features, i.e., digital thermo and timer controls, larger and deeper fry basket with oil container. The name brand competition also had mixed reviews so I figured if I am going to get fried, I'll do it for $40. less on price. Both units made in China. Could be the same producer. If honeymoon ends early I'll follow up with revised review."
1,DEEP FRYER,"I BOUGHT THIS DEEP FRYER FOR MY DAUGHTER AS A WEDDING PRESENT.SHE PLUGGED IT IN, THE GREASE MELTED, IT TURNED OFF AND IT WONT GO BACK ON. I DONT UNDERSTAND. THIS WAS VERY BAD FOR ME AS IT WAS A WEDDING PRESENT, IT WAS GIFT WRAPPED, AND I THREW AWAY THE RECEIPT, NEVER DREAMING THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN. SOOOO I WOULD NOT ADVISE PEOPLE TO BUY IT."
3,Black plastic pieces crack easily,"I own the similar Bravetti Pro stainless steel deep fryer. After only a few months of ownership, I noticed that anything that's made of black plastic on the unit has started to crack. The main ""head unit"" -- the piece that contains the electronics and where the immersion coil connects -- developed two large cracks. Next, the black plastic ""feet"" parts started cracking. I'm waiting for the black plastic handles to crack and break off while I'm carrying the unit full of hot oil!Aside from this, I love the unit. It heats up quickly and stays hot. Really fries foods up nicely."
4,"Good not bad, could be better","Had this product for little over 2 years, which is lot longer that any other units of different brands that I had previously. Cooking time is pretty quick once the unit is warmed up, closer to the end the unit started to overheat, at first it would only go to overheat circuit breaker, once it cooled off you reset it and it work again, but later it would self power off even before the cooking was done, lets says if it was pre heated and the cooking timer was set to 5 minutes it would self power off at 1 minute to go, which after a while it was pain in the a**, so it was retired. I will definnitely buy another one as soon it becomes available.Usage time on mine was little over 2 years, by family of 5 used approximatley twice a weak, I think it lasted long enought."
1,Piece of Junk!,"It works fine for about 3-9 months then the heating element quits. I've bought the heating element twice...the 1st time it worked for about 9 months then the 2nd time it worked for about 3 months. This unit is a ""piece of junk! I recommend you DO NOT waist your money and do a search on a better quality fryer. With the Euro-Pro F1066 you are better off with the old fashion frying pan!"
3,Save your money,"This was the best fryer I ever owned for 45 days then the electronics failed. The design is perfect but based on my experience and that of many others they should remove it from the market until they can make it last more than a few weeks of normal use. Great concept very bad execution.A change of heart, I found the secret telephone number for Euro-pro 866-694-6401 they are sending a replacement at no cost with no hassle. Perhaps they decided on some good PR."
3,Euro-Am,"I have had several deep fryers over the years by different brands (Rival, Delonghi, Presto, etc.) and this fryer by far has some of the best features compared to the others. I love the fast frying time (1700 watt heater), the basket (some fryers omit this lovely item), the size (I can cook for the family in one basket), and the overall design makes me feel like I am getting resturant quality frying. The things that I do not like are the absences of a cool touch exterior (it gets really hot), that the cord has to be connected to the unit by magnets, the seemingly filmsy exterior (although it holds the frying unit wonderfully), the constant cleaning (stainless steel after all), and the large amount of oil I go though every month to refill it (it takes about a good 100 fluid ounces to fill and that is good for about 8-9 fry times). If you do not plan to use this fryer a lot, than I say buy it, but if you are, then I say move on and spend your money on a Delonghi."
5,Euro-Pro hits the mark,"This high quality digital deep fryer from Euro-Pro is an excellent choice for the home cook for fried food. Fill it up with oil and turn it on...it reaches the hottest setting quickly and maintains the temperature well, after food is added. The correct cooking temperature produces a great end product, as you will find your food crisp and light, not greasy. The flavors of the food, not the oil, make it to the table. The unit itself is solid...excellent design with features that are simple yet very effective. The digital display is very helpful and the green ready light lets you know when your desired temperature has been reached...Buy it and see fried food in a whole new light!"
1,Do Not Buy! Not Worth The $ and customer service stinks!,"I bought this product and it worked great at first and then stopped working all together, this was after about 4 uses. I cleaned and checked everything and then contacted customer service who told me I had to buy a new heating element for it. After complaining enough they agreed to send me another heating unit. It is now about 5 months later and the same thing has happened. This item was not even used more than a dozen times. I just got off the phone and they are telling me I need to buy another part even though there item is faulty and doesn't work right. Spend your money with another company."
1,received the fryer broken,"I received this fryer and it never worked. I got in contact with amazon.com and they ""said"" that they would send me my money back. That was over eight months ago. I haven't heard anything since then!"
1,Looks Real Nice ...,"... but mine quit after only one use. I bought it for Christmas for only $59.00 and free S/H, through Amazon. It looks nice, but as I experienced, it is as cheep as the price. I now see that the price has increased to $79! BEWARE ... I am thrifty and was sucked in with the LOW price and GOOD LOOKS, but now I will have to send it back and try a higher quality name.PS- Amazon does make the return an easy process ... if you decide to buy one of these cheap fryers!"
1,Totally defective (Zero Stars- not one as above),"I did what I think is a fair amount of reseach before buying this product, and the Euro-Pro was bad decision. The product wouldn't even turn on, much less work. The packaging indicated it had passed Qulaity Control. whatever that means This was a Christmas gift that totally flopped. The Euro-Pro was one of the more expensive deep fryers in the store and I assumed the price was equal to the quality, boy was I wrong. If you're purchasing a deep fryer please stick to the name brands. This will be exchanged tomorrow and not for another Euro-Pro. Too bad because my 16 year old was looking forward to Deepfried Japanese dumplings for Christmas. A real disappointment"
1,Euro Pro - More like Euro Trash,"I had this unit for less than 6 months, and I used it about 10 times. The last time I tried to use it, no response - I could not get it to work at all. Customer Service for this product was non-responsive - I threw it out in disgust. I had thought hard before buying this unit, not being familiar with the brand name. Now I know - stay away from this mutt."
1,Very dissappointed with customer service,"I got my deep fryer as a gift and it worked for about 2 months with some problems of shutting itself off after getting to temp. finally it just quit coming on. I called the 800 number on the owner's manual and they gave me another 800 number to call that line is always busy. I sent an email from thier webpage and a lady did call me back after 2 weeks, she said they knew of the problem and would send a replacement right away. That has been 8 weeks now and I do not get any response anylonger from emails and the 800 number is still busy. I would not recommend any Euro Pro product to anyone. Even my Shark vac fell apart after a couple of months."
1,Stay Away For Now,"Dispite all the negative reviews, I decided to give the machine a try. In less than 10 minutes, the machine died. Euro-Pro should recall this machine and fix the electronics."
1,Buyer beware!,"I personally recommend that you WAIT for a better DVD product of this timeless classic--Kennel Murder Case. Amazon is likely to bring one out sometime when someone produces a QUALITY product.I returned this version (Silver Screen Classics) that appears to have been produced in someone's garage on a shoestring budget!! The DVD loaded for over four minutes and NEVER did load for viewing--after several attempts. I weep over the shame of someone taking such cruel advantage of Public Domain.This is a rip-off, in my opinion. I'm hoping to get my money back."
4,GOOD FOR AN OLDIE,"William Powell is always enjoyable. In THE KENNEL MURDER CASE look for a young Mary Astor and the ever helpful character actor, Eugene Pallette. If you show dogs, this is a treat. Some things never change!"
4,Good Low-end Woodworking Vise,"This vise does not have the heft of a Record or Jet, nor does it offer quick-release functionality. It is a good basic vise with a bench dog for 1/4 to 1/3 the price. If you are outfitting a top-end workbench then get the Record. If you just need a vise but don't want to invest too heavily, this will do the trick."
3,A good product,"Doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but for the money it's a solid product. It does what I need."
4,Yummy Necco Wafers.,"I used to eat these all the time as a kid, and even into my 20's. There is only one flavor that I don't really care for, but I can still eat a whole package of these without even thinking about it. It's hard to believe they've been around for so long."
1,Chalky abominations,"Chalky, unpleasant disks that come in crappy synthetic flavors. That's all that needs to be said."
1,"Great Movie, HORRIBLE quality DVD","AS everyone knows, ""Rain"" is one of Hollywood's earliest and most brutally honest depictions of holy-rollers and hypocrisy. I was soooo happy to find it on DVD, and sooo horribly disappointed in the quality of this DVD. It skips and jumps, stops, restarts and is basicaly a complete rip-off. Maybe buy this for 99 cents just for the cover artwork, but never, never, never buy this scratchy, disjointed, skip-fest of a DVD. The rip-off company that produced this DVD should be ashamed of itself!"
1,Don't get this one!!!,"I received this cover ready to move out of my house.... came with a hole and zipper broke, I don't if already broke when I tried zipping it, there was absolutely no tension while pulling zipper shout."
1,Cheaply made,Bought this because my daughter frequently wets the bed. Ripped in several places while trying to get it on. Never was able to zip it closed
2,More appropriate for a shower curtain... maybe.,"Very light-weight. Ripped in two places as I was trying to place it on a 9"" tall box spring. Actually placing it into the bed-frame caused a couple more rips. Used packing tape to seal the tears and offer some protection from the new bed-bug menace that seems to be sweeping the country. I will not buy this again."
1,Ripped the Minute I put it on,Absolutely horrible manufacturing! I just wasted 20 dollars on a plastic bag that ripped the minute i tried to put it on. Awesome!
1,Was not what I thought,I think is not well detailed the information on the web. The odor of the material is annoying and is not that confortable. for kids that love peeing on the bed is perfect.
1,They were better a few years ago,"Two years ago I would have given this product a rave 5 star review, because when we bought two of them then (one for our mattress, one for my son's), they were really wonderful. Very thick and sturdy. They are still holding up well. Recently I bought another to put on our box springs, and it's a completely different product. The vinyl feels entirely different - it's thin and ripped in several spots while we were working it over the box springs. They are literally side by side for comparison. I feel tricked. I looked in my buying history to make sure that I bought the very same cover because I was so happy with the two we already had, but the seller has pulled a switcharoo.Anyhow, this would explain the older 5 star reviews, and the newer 1 star reviews."
1,"Too expensive, it broke at the moment that was open","I bought the cover to protect my mattress from a move, once I put it on tge zipper broke as well as the corners, for 30.00 is not worth it and doesn't get the job done , simple piece of crap, thinner than a .99 cent shower curtin material DON'T BUY!!"
1,"Cheap, cheap vinyl.","One slight tug and this product tore. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product. Such a simple, basic item should last at least a few months."
3,Good when moving,"I purchased two of these for my mattress and box spring during our last move. They did a decent job of protecting them from dirt and moisture during the move. However, they did get torn as we were moving them out of the truck and into the apartment, so make sure that no one drags the mattresses, even on smooth floors. Also make sure you measure your mattress, these were a very snug fit on mine, I probably could have used another inch."
4,GOOD FOR STORAGE AND PROTECTION,GOOD FOR STORAGE USE AND TO PROTECT YOUR MATTRESS SPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE THE LITTLE ONES ON POTTY TRAINING. VERY EASY TO PUT ON BUT YOU HAVE TO BECAREFUL BECAUSE IT RIPS EASILY SPECIALLY IF THERE'S ANYTHING POPPING OUT OF THE MATTRESS ITSELF!BUYING IT THRU AMAZON WAS EASY AND QUICK SHIPMENT!!
2,not worth it...,"the hold around the zipper is pathetic. I was trying to put this onto my sons bed, and it ripped at the slightest amount of tension. Luckily the tear was at the end of the bed, so no worries there.I don't think this is a good purchase. It needs to be better constructed. I've worn ponchos that were tougher than this is."
4,Great for dbl pillow top but delicate...,"This is a great item. Bought it to protect mattress from a sweaty hubby and a kindergartener who occasionally wants to sleep in mommy's bed but is still working on staying dry all night. Was concerned I would have trouble because our mattress is a double pillow top and is extremely thick, but cover fit perfectly. It did tear a tiny bit but it's because we yanked it too hard when putting it on...so it's not so good for anything more than to protect your mattress. Even with the tiny tear (which we taped up) I am super happy with this product. Makes no noise at all."
5,Seven Turns,"Great cd with songs like, Good Clean Fun, Low Down Dirty Mean and True Gravity. Also Great service Arrived promptly."
3,for dedicated fans,"The rest of the world wasn't receptive to the comeback of the ABB.""Good Clean Fun"" was the hit but the rest are worthy of the legend.I can't recommend it for just anybody,especially today's ""music"" buying public."
4,high quality band--high quality blues,"nothing fancy here.just the blistering blues guitars and the Gregg Allman vocal growl we have come to expect--and that,my friends,is just fine.Warren Haynes does an excellent Duane Allman musicalimpersonation on the guitar--his lead vocal on 2 songs isa little thin (picture Keith Richards singing ""Happy"") but it is OK in this context. this album will not recruit many new fans-but those of us us already in the fold will enjoy having it.at the time of this review--this disk was selling for a superbargin price--(around $3.00) do not let the fact that it is inexpensive deter you from this one--you willnot be sorry."
4,Versatile jazz,"The album seems to be a blueprint for Branford's Buckshot LeFonque-project, because it covers many different aspect of jazz. The album features blues (with help from B.B.King and John Lee Hooker), 'Dance of the Hei Gui' is a Thelonious Monk-tribute, 'Brother Trying to Catch a Cab (On the East Side) Blues' is a Marsalis-jazz-track and 'Berta, Berta' features the chanting and moaning of railroadworkers (slaves) taking you right to the core of American music history. The versatility of this album can only be found on both Buckshot LeFonque albums, so if you like this (and you don't really, really hate hip-hop music) be sure to check them out."
3,"Black Lock, Not Purple","The picture shows a purple lock (or maybe it's just a bad picture?) but I recieved a black lock, this isn't a big deal for me but I thought it would have been nice if it was a different color so I could easily mark the keys. Just wanted to leave a review incase someone else needed a colored lock."
1,"""True Grip"" gloves a real disappointment!","The first day I wore my ""True Grip"" work gloves the base material between the thumb and index finger gave way to a hole the size of a quarter. I have since purchased a pair of work gloves by ""Ironclad"" which have held up to the tasks of a ""work"" glove much better."
2,NOT Built to Last,"It is a big case, but that is about the only good thing that i can say for this product. I've had it for six months and I'm ready to throw it away. Both the handle and the shoulder strap are irreparably busted and a sizeable handful of my discs (about 20) have been fatally damaged by this case. I am a DJ so I need to move this case around and its simply too flimsy to handle the job. If you plan on taking it anywhere, discs will inevitably become badly scratched {The pockets are very loose and if your discs aren't scratched because they fall out, they will be scratched by the dirt and debris that can far too easily make its way into the roomy pockets}. If you really care about your collection, you are much better off with two smaller Case Logic CD wallets."
5,Excellent!!!!!,I love this cd holder because it holds everything in place. It's very sturdy and well made out of good material. I love how it has the pocket on the inside of it; so you can put extra stuff in there as well. It'll also keep your your disc's well organized with the different section protective sleeves. Plus it's a amazing price for this item.
4,Good product,Item came quickly bigger than i realized when i ordered it lol the only reason i didnt give a 5 is you have to remove all the little things in the sleeves to put the discs in
4,Good deal,Liked it so much a bought a few. Was great I recommend to anyone who has a lot of DVDs and needs storage
2,In theory great,"The idea of a huge box to fill your disks in is very appealing particularly for the price. But three problems. I have trouble zipping up the wallet. Also, the disks seem to keep falling out. Finally, the biggest issue is that this wallet as many others requires you to PUSH OUT the plastic for each and every disk slot. And some of the plastic remains until you keep pulling. My gosh why can't you just provide the pouches with no plastic-removal piece for those of us who have better things to do than spend time tearing out plastic on perforations which sometimes cause you to ""over tear"" the cut out."
5,huge cd wallet,Finally I dont have a mess with my huge collection of my CD's .Everything is in one place so easy to find cd I want to listen .
2,huge wallet,i got this to get rid of all the plastic cases for my dvds. it did the trick for the most part. i think cause its not totally full it is a little hard to manuever and the cds sometimes slip out of the holders. other then that i got it fast and it does the trick.
5,nice,We have looked for other cases and were frustrated by the choices. this is bigger than what we wanted but it is nice to be able to keep the jackets in there also. Seems to be durable and my son plans on taking it to college with him to help keep track of gaming disks also. Fast delivery!
5,cd case,great product. I have all my CD's and the sheet from each one with room to spare. Perfect for me to take traveling with all my music.
3,Only Three Stars,This is Only Getting a Three Star rating because of the Cheap Plastic Zipper If you plan on Putting about 350 Cd's in it. Then it would be a Great Case for you. However I have over 450 and the Zipper Broke When I Picked it Back up. The Plastic Zipper can't Handle the Strain of more then 350 Cd's
4,"Massive, Sturdy, Sleeves leave something to be desired","The actual shell of this case is fantastic. I use it for my DVD's and BluRay's to save space in my small house, and it is perfect for just that. The sleeves that come with this are fairly cheap in quality and if the case tips upside down when not zipped, some of the discs have a tendency to slide out. That said, the case is designed so you can replace the sleeves with different ones if you desire, which I might have to do with time. For now, this is working just fine for my needs."
4,e,"Love the product. Would have given it a 5 star, but found the task of pulling out the pieces of plastic to open the cd slots a bit tedious. Otherwise, it's great."
5,I love this,they is what i needed for my cd collection and the design and the way it is put together is well done. will be getting another one soon.cannot beat the price anywhere.
5,Perfect,"Wanted to save much needed storage space, so I ditched all of the hard cases on all of our audio and video and bought this case. It freed up 4 shelves in my bookcase. GREAT!"
4,Def worth it,"Saved me a boxload of space, easy to carry. Def the best I've purchased...and that includes many from case logic. Wish it was all black but the quality makes up for it."
2,Nice case poor quality zipper,"I purchased this big nice case to hold our karaoke disc for our business. The second weekend of use the zipper broke. Case is still usable,but because the disc will slip out of the holder pages a little too easy I don't feel safe to carry by the handle without it being zipped up. Would've returned but we have a lot of disc and didn't want to spend the time to unload and load again and I had already trashed the other case."
4,Good Price,It serves its purpose for a good price. Will buy more if I need to. I really dont have much more to say about this product. Amazon requires that I type at least 20 words to describe my experience. Shipping was fast also.
3,I Did Not Get The Color Shown In The Picture I Wanted It To Be Black & Red...,I Did Not Get The Color Shown In The Picture I Wanted It To Be Black & Red.The Quality Of the Product is Poor...
4,just the right size,The price was good. The quality of material is durable. Small enough to take along on a vacation. Too large to keep in the car for everyday use.
3,Good book but...,"Thr drills are very good. A lot of them are useful for athletes to do alone. But he tends to believe that we all have field houses to workout in during the winter. Here in NY we have a very small gym and have and even smaller budget. Some of his drills just can't work in our situation. Overall, I would recommend it to all high school and college coaches, just be prepared to adapt."
5,"Where, oh where, has my flatware gone?","I ordered two 5-piece place settings of Mikasa flatware, but was sent the wrong pattern. I was told the Silver Spoon would send a label so I could return the wrong flatware, but no label has come yet. I would have reordered, but they were out of my pattern, anyway, so I cancelled. I hope it's still being made by the time I find another place to buy it. :)"
5,Love is the greatest gift of all. . . .,"I wrote ""I Love You Because"" and want to thank all of you for the wonderful sentiments you shared about the book. Love is the greatest gift you could possibly give and get in your life. In the end it is the only thing that matters. I hope that all of you are surrounded by love each day, recognize it and feel blessed by it."
5,Simply Wonderful!,"I Love You Because... has to be one of the most delightful, refreshing books I have seen. This wonderful book is not only a tribute to love, but it is also a tribute to our beautiful children. The photographs capture the essence of the text. Parents should make ""I Love You Because"" a part of their child's book collection. What a simply wonderful gift to give to those we love."
5,"Colorblind implores all to listen to the ""Call of the Wild""","""I was downtrodden, rebuked & reviled, I did not listen to the call of the wild..."" or so Colorblind James testifies on the title track ""Call of the Wild,"" the latest CD by Upstate NY's Colorblind James Experience. Many standout tracks, ""I Hate this World Sometimes,"" ""Lock Him Up!"" & ""Dr. Negative""."
3,If only the symphony received the same treatment as Hero,"The Hero's Song is wonderful stuff, done very well--well chosen tempi, excellent playing, decent engineering, etc.But the symphony, well, it's dead in the water, a joyless romp that lacks charm, despite being professionally played (but with some strain in the stings). The first movement foreshadows the soggy affair. This wonderful piece cries out for some affection, and Macal doesn't give it to us."
5,Why Men Become Curmudgeons,"AARP Bulletin tipped me off to this book. What an eye-opener! The author, a psychotherapist, observed that 80% of his patients in the 40 to 55 year range suffered from this irritability. He attributes it mostly to hormone changes, but also to their stage in life/career/etc.He recommends that both partners learn to focus on the other's needs rather than on who's right and who's wrong."
3,Borring,"I did not like the structure of the book. It is repetitive and I started loosing interest after reading a few chapters, I put it away and I'm not sure I want to finish it."
1,Don't Waste You Money!!!!,"I returned this product after 3 weeks and, like the previous buyer, I was charged about $50.00 too. The quality is not worth it. The slide does not stay on the ground properly. It is rolled when you receive it and for some reason I could never unroll it so that it remained flat. There was a permanent curl at the end and it would end up rolling at each end automatically! This was dangerous because I nearly fell several times trying to slide and the curved ends were not secure. The company should put the rubber backing on the entire product not just the end. Anyway, save your time and money and research other products because you will be charged for shipping and restocking too...if returned."
2,Dissapointed,"We got this in the mail and were never able to use it the ""easy assembly"" as they say was not so easy the screws on both ends did not catch and therfore the slide never assembled correctly. I was higly dissapointed i was so looking forward to using this slide it looks so fun. Oh well>."
4,Good Book,I really liked this book. I couldnt find it in my town and needed it for a school assignment. It got here on time and in good condition. It took a little bit longer to get to me than I expected but I got the assignment done on time. I recomend this book.
3,Alike but diferent.,"This is the second in the Code Name series. ""Payback"" was the first one and I like it better. John Baroone and his secret group of people light up the Southwest with guns, bombs and bullets. They fight outlaw biker gangs and crooked business men and the mob. Sometimes there are two or three against twenty to forty bikers. The two or three always win, go figure. This reminds me of his Mountain Man series which I enjoyed until the books started being filled with flashbacks to previous books. This appears to be the same story line as those books, just in a different setting. I think the earlier Mountain Men books and his Eagle series are much better that the Code series."
1,"Review of ""Code name : Survival""","I can only wish that there was a lower rating than one star. This is the most predictable, boring, unbelievable so-called ""action"" book I have ever seen. The dialogue fails miserably to make up for the lack of plot or character development. Most action books give a little education on weapons or have interesting characters. This book does nothing but bore and cause you to laugh at the same dialogue repeated again and again. Please do not waste your time or money on it."
1,Horrible.,"This is the worst book I have ever read in my entire life. The writing style is terrible, with the most hackneyed dialoge and plot. I felt like I was watching a bad episode of Walker: Texas Ranger or V.I.P.. There was the cast of elite commandos who act like little kids, (Like the guy who is always hungry). Having a bunch of bikers as the bad guys? They aren't bikers but your normal stereotype associated with them: dirty, dumb, and loud. There is plenty of action, which is the same exact thing over and over. ... It was funny the first time but he did it in every fight scene! Then the blood and gore descriptions from bullets sounded like a bad video game, like eyeballs being the only thing left on a table. No drama, no plot, boring dialoge, et cetera. Save yourself the five dollars on the book and pay to get this man to English 101."
1,Self obsessed,"A very pretentious book by a very pretentious author, I recommend this book only if you have excellent gag reflex. Incessant name-dropping, absurd pop culture references and the overall self-indulging, self-absorbed character of the protagonist will make you want to hurl this book to the wall. In every underground scene, there are posers, and Wei Hui's book is the biggest one of all.To think that this is semi-autobiographical! I shudder at the thought of someone this big-headed actually moving around in Shanghai."
1,LLLLaaame,Ok...Maybe I'm not being totally fair... So truly speaking it is quite .....Lllllaaaaaameee... I'd give it zero stars if I could.
1,Get a life,"If I could I'd give it 0 stars. I flipped through it, waiting in the departure lounge at an airport. Grrrr... I din't think airheads like her could publish and sell books!She needs to think beyond clothes and skin care. My advice to would be readers, don't bother.It is a waste of time and money.Besides, who wants to encourage airheaded writers like that? Save paper."
3,Decent Christmas barbershop,"This album is exactly what one might expect. It is a barbershop quartet of old men, singing a collection of traditional Christmas carols arranged with barbershop chords. Several passages of the biblical accounts of the Christmas story are included, which might seem like a good idea but actually makes the disc somewhat disjointed. The musical quality is solid, though the tenor sounds a bit screechy at times, and the lead doesn't sound the best when he is singing solos. Overall, the quartet is decent, but they are much better as an ensemble than as soloists.Ultimately, if you like barbershop, you'll probably like this album. There are no bells and whistles, and it's nothing spectacular, but I always enjoy listening to it each year in December."
4,Solid ensemble performance,"I have several of the Heart of Christmas CDs that I bought one year, and I was glad to find a copy of this available, because there is nothing better than Christmas carols being sung by a choir or ensemble. Barbershop harmony is one of the best sounding group performances when done well. While the other review may have some technical merit, I listen to Christmas music to hear the carols and not to pretend to be a music critic or expert. If you enjoy well sung Christmas carols, you will enjoy this performance."
5,Great Book ! Great Ideas !,"Every page of this book has something in it either to learn about flowers or decorating with flowers. The craft ideas and the directions are easy to follow with professional results. I never knew Holiday decorating could be this easy and so decorative. I've started to make some projects to bring to friends houses instead of wine or dessert. Everyone is very impressed with the results. ""Fun"" book !"
4,Beautiful as well as practical,"I gave this book as a gift. It has gorgeous pictures and arrangements a normal person could actually reproduce. While some bouquets are involved and complex, others are very straight forward. It also looks nice just on a coffee table. If you like to make flower arrangements this is a good book."
2,No designs I would actually use,"I bought this book for ideas and tips to use when making floral arrangements for friends and family. I had just completed a floral design course and was eager to continue on my own. A big attraction of the book was the authors' connection to 1-800-FLOWERS. I expected well designed arrangements, easy enough for a non-professional to re-create. Instead the book contains an odd assortment of cutesy, unattractive arrangements that seem more like craft projects. For example, a bunch of alstroemerias encircled with asparagus stalks, artichokes filled with tulips, and a bunch of purple lisianthus in a glass tumbler covered with plastic craft beads. I do not see even one projects that I will make."
3,story is good,"The book is good, story is well written, and it comes with a music CD. When I bought it I misunderstood and thought it was an audiobook that the kids could listen to, but it was just samples of music, not the actual story."
5,The A mazing Doll,"It is a book that is full of surprises. The biggest, most interesting surprise is when Natasha uses her grandmother's doll. It came to life and the doll was mean to Natasha. I loved the drawings. This story could be a lesson for us not to be mean to our mothers..."
5,A Good Lesson,"Babushka's Doll is a very entertaining book because it let's us see how giving and demanding orders makes you feel, aswell as how being at the receiving end of all of these demands can really affect you. My daughters and I enjoyed it very much."
5,Life Experiences,"Length:: 1:38 MinsNatasha goes to visit her grandmother, Babushka. She wants her Babushka to swing her, give her a ride in the goat cart, and feed her right away. She does not want to wait. While they are eating lunch Natasha ask if she could play with her doll.Babushka told Natasha she could play with the doll while she was at the store. When Babushka left the doll came to life and demanded Natasha to play with her. Natasha thought it was fun at first. Then the doll became more and more demanding just like she was being towards her grandmother.All relationships need to be mindful of the other peple. You can use this book to teach your children how to act towards others. We need to treat others with kindness."
4,Interesting arrangement.,"This is a very interesting arrangement for strings orchestra, by Frygies Hidas, plenty of magyar flavor,however the full orchestral traditional dances we are used to listen are much more preferable. Good as acuriosity and for knowing another approach of those famous dances."
5,Wynton Marsalis at his best,Wynton Marsalis at his best. One lovely piece after another. A wonderful collection!
5,Trumpet come alive,I love this cd! Wynton makes his trumpet talk as if it were alive. The Seductress is a beautiful peice with just trumpet and piano. All I can say is that I never get tired of listening to this cd. I love the combo. of jazz and classical.
4,Copper fire pit,"Very nice, but a bit smaller than I thought since it was touted as large. Frame could have been a bit sturdier for the money."
3,Hot Erotic Movie,There's lots of sex scenes in here to suit any erotic fan. If your in the mood get 15 Minutes of Fame.
1,No Cleaning Power,"This product sounded great, with the direct plug-in, but it didn't have any cleaning power. I had previously used an Oral B, and have now gone back to it. The interplak would stop moving with the slightest pressure on your teeth.In addition, I was very annoyed with Amazon because when I purchased the toothbrush it recommended purchase of replacement heads, which I purchased, but which did not go with the toothbrush I ordered. So be careful. This has now happened to me with another purchase for bike accessories, too. What a hassle to get an item, have it not work, and then have to return it. Oy!"
1,interplak sucks!,Don't waste your money on this tooth brush. It was recomended by my dentist so I got it. I used it for 5 days 10 times and decided it was not worth using and it is now in the dumpster.Brad
1,Don't buy a Interplak tooth brush.,I have been using interplak for over 20 years. I think the rotary action is the best way to clean ones teeth. The first one I bought had an electric cord attached to it. It lasted for many years. Then they stopped making the brushes so I had to buy one with a battery. In the first battery tooth brushes the battery lasted a little over a year. You can't just buy a repayment battery you have to buy a new tooth brush. Every time I buy a new one the battery last less and less. I bought one 6 months ago the battery died. The warrantee had run out so I bought another one thinking that I just got a bad battery. Now the one I just got is not holding a charge it starts to slow down before I finish. I don't know why they don't make one with a cord.
1,interplak dp19 rechargeable power toothbrush,I have used this toothbrush for many years but it has been drastically changed since my last one. The product now is such a poor quality that it astounds me. It does not compare to the original one and I am sure that is why it disappeared from the market and I had to order it to get one.....guess that should have been a clue for me. Also noticed that the company has been sold.The on/off is hard to press; it's hard to pull apart for recharging and the power is weak even in the strongest seetting.
5,will make your dentist very happy,I've used this brush for 8 months now and I won't be without it ever. I've had no problems with it holding power in fact mine will go days without being charged. I use peroxide mouth wash and my husband uses peroxyl. We only use toothpaste and regular brushes when we travel. If you subtract the savings on toothpaste (nearly everyone uses both paste and mouthwash) this appliance is not a luxury.
1,Dead on Arrival - Euro Pro Ice Cream Maker,"Like two other reviewers, my unit had the loud buzzing of one of the fans presumably in charge of the cooling process. I was (rightly) concerned when I placed the order after reading the negative reviews, but I thought I'd give it a chance, with Amazon's great customer service backing me."
1,Reason for storing on side,This is not about the machine but addresses the confusion of putting it on its side for a time. It is the same principle of having to move a refrigerator upright and not lying it down in the bed of a truck. There is liquid in the compressor coils and it has to work it's way back to where it is supposed to be before you turn it on.
1,This is junk!,"I waited nearly four months for this item and, finally, when it arrived the cooling system and motor did not work. I returned it and Amazon replaced it. The second one didn't work either. Not only that but it took three days to get through to the manufacturer and their customer support wasn't much help either.Have returned the second one to Amazon and gone back to my old reliable Krups (pre-chill the bucket in the freezer) ice cream maker. It always works. Don't waste your money or your time with this piece of junk!"
1,I Scream,"I got the machine, and laid it on its side overnight. Next day tried to run a batch of ice cream. Followed instructions, but the first sign of trouble was when the compressor suddenly got very loud (basically sound and noise level of a *loud* central air conditioner -- as heard from right next to it). The machine ran it's full 65 minute cycle, and no dice. I tried to run it through another cycle (after waiting a couple of minutes to turn the compressor back on as per instructions). Unfortunately, it forces you to wait 15 minutes to start the mixer. And even more unfoturnate, it still didn't cool my ice cream enough to freeze it (possibly partially related to the low fat recipe). I think the compressor must be of low quality."
3,Can be fixed,"I got this as a gift for my b-day. I too had the same problems when you start it up it sounded like an aircraft but if you take off the three little screws on the side and place a drop of superglue on the shaft where the fan blade attaches to your in business. Simple fix, stupid of the company for all those units sent back for this problem. Makes a hell of a great ice cream."
1,Never finished it,I usually love this author. Unfortunatley I wasn't able to finish this one. There are so many errors in the print that it really frustrated me to read it. I am so very disappointed. :(
2,"Nice solid locks, but...","I bought these locks to use on my fence gates because they were supposed to be good for outdoor use. The rubber cover over the keyhole sounded like a good idea, but all they do is hold the moisture in so the mechanism rusts. After awhile, I had lots of trouble unlocking them; now I can't lock them any more. In fact, I can't even get the key out of the last one. I have since replaced them with locks that don't hold the water inside."
3,"Only two keys, really?","The locks seem fine, just like locks. But there are only two keys for all three locks. That seems a little stingy."
2,Not the same as pictured,"The item received is not the same as the one pictured. The item pictured shows a protective cover over the shackle, the one received has no covering. It also only comes with two keys for three locks"
5,"Great lock, Great price!!","I purchased this set of three locks to use one to lock up my spare tire under my truck, so it is continually exposed to the elements. So far I have had no issues with the lock rusting or being hard to open. The rubber casing on the lock helps to keep mud and dirt from getting into the internals of the lock, keeping it in good working order for longer.I also like the flap on bottom that covers the keyhole, as that is usually a common area for a lock to rust and get dirt in making the key hard to turn, so far I have had none of those issues. Another benefit is that all of the locks are keyed alike giving you the ability to use the locks in different places but only having to carry one key.Overall I would highly recommend this lock to anybody looking for something sturdy and that is going to withstand the elements better than a standard padlock."
1,A terrible example of DVD technology.,"The manufacturer of this DVD did not make any effort to digitally re-master the source material. Imagine an old vacuum-tube TV set with just a piece of aluminum foil for an antenna, then try to imagine viewing this movie via on-air broadcast from a TV station 100 miles away. Can you immagine that? Good! You'd have better picture quality in that scenario than you have from this DVD. Sound on ""Call It Murder"" is delayed by a second or so, making you wonder just who in the picture is doing the talking. Add to that the loud background hiss coming from your speakers the whole time. This DVD is trash. Even if you were given this DVD for free, you'd want to throw it away. Don't waste your money!"
1,More Madacy trash...,"Madacy has done it again...taken what could have been decent DVD's and turned them into trash. The video transfer from film is very poor, but the worst is the audio. Madacy has a history of producing low-cost low-quality legacy DVD's, just look at other reviews of Madacy titles (check out Charlie Chaplin DVD's)."
1,Hollywood Tough Guys DVD 3 Pack,"This is a big waste of money. With the audio lagging the video by 5+ seconds, it's impossible to watch"
1,Horrible quality,"I can't compare this to any other versions, or to a different, longer, and better ""cut"" as mentioned in other reviews of other editions, but I'll say this -- the sound quality is positively abysmal. Left channel sound comes and goes as it pleases, and actors' voices are so muddy it's difficult to understand plain English. I haven't watched it long enough to find any of the video flaws that others mention, and the way it's going, I may not need to.Fortunately I didn't waste any money on this. Got it from the library.Move along folks, move along. Nothing to see here."
1,Jeopardy TV Game,"The Jeopardy Game was brand new, but it wasn't what I was expecting. It was pretty outdated already. You need to plug the cord into the TV, and the cord length was short so you have to sit very close to the TV to play. You can play with 3 players, but there is only 1 controller. It is hard for 2 players to be able to answer the questions with 1 controller even. The answers to the questions are multiple choice so it wasn't like the real game. I returned it to the person I bought it from and am waiting for a refund."
4,Jeopardy game,The whole family enjoyed this product. It worked as promised. The answers are given in a multiple choice format so it made it easier in the harder subjects. We love it!
5,great product,I have bought some knockoffs online in the past.nothing like the real thing.these are the bestfast shipping
3,2 Years and Bad Iris,"I had the same exact problem as described by Michael A. Criswell ""the_criz"". I called support, they said we can fix it, just ship to our Canon Factory Service Center. I get an e-mail back from them saying that the camera has an over-exposure problem. (Duh! That is why I sent it to you.) They want $170 to fix and no explanation regarding the problem and why it happens until after they fix it and get there repair money. I have not even used this camera a lot."
1,Optura 10/20 Junkcorder,"These camcorders have an inherent manufacturing defect that apparently Canon hasn't fessed-up to. I use mine rarely. I bought a reconditioned Optura 20 several years ago. I quickly noticed that it operated only in low light mode unles it was ""warm"". I was using it backpacking and it would work ok when I left it in the sun or put it inside my coat, but once it got cool, the only thing I could photograph was a polar bear in a snowstorm. I've fixed and torn apart camcorders before, so I got me a busted Optura 10 on eBay with a bad tape drive for a song and a dance...less than 20 bucks. I figured I could swap the CCD board out if my Optura 20 got any worse. Wrong!! The optura 10 had the EXACT same problem. As for the Optura 20, the problem has gotten worse with time. now, it has to be really warm to function. Avoid this camcorder like the plague."
2,Bad Iris,"Thanks for this site, I know realize my optura 20 is doing the same thing. It seems like it's stuck in low light mode. It goes into the is about 80% of the time when I power it on to the record mode. Sometimes I get lucky, but you can't shut it off, because if you do you may not be able to get it into the right mode again. You can't really use it because everything is slow and too white. I've had the camera for 3 years and it's been used very little. Not good build quality, now I can't wait to hear what the cost of repair will be. Is there enough people out there for a class action?"
4,Excellent durable camera,"I bought my Canon new back in 2003 or so, and just now, almost ten years later, finally donated it to a local charity. I put in thousands of hours of recording around the world on it, and while the quality was never rock star film grade, it did a bang-up job of capturing the events I was filming. The camera was extremely durable - outlasting another video camera I bought in 2008 - and never gave me any problems in this extremely long time of heavy use.Thanks, Canon, for making an excellent camera."
2,Junkpile is the next Stop for this Baby,"Over the last two years, the camera has gotten progressively worse. It is out of warranty and the Stuck in low light mode problem has gone from once in every five startups to about 9 out of ten. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a one star rating is the large screen and general ease of use. When it is working , it is the best small camcorder I have used. (not that I have used very many) I have been looking for a solution to this problem, but when my daughter takes the Optura 20 to school and calls me in the middle of the day to ask how to fix this, it is time to give it the old heave-ho.I have tried a new CR-2025 battery, but that didn't work. I have tried jiggling things after starting, and before starting. Nothing seems to work every time. Since it has progressed over time, it seems to be connected to a sensor cleanliness and firmware combined problem. But I wish that I knew more."
1,Low light problem WARNING!!!,"A huge warning for anyone out there looking at this camera!! We dont use ours often and one day it started loading up and being stuck in its low light mode. this means any amount of light in the room causes it to wash out and record as blur. When I looked into this issue, it turned out that there were plenty of others out there that had the same problem with the Optura 20. It will cost you $150-300 to fix. its sad, becuse in so many other ways it was a great camcorder- but a flaw like this can ruin it all."
1,Bad Iris:Stuck in Low Light Setting,Avoid this product and perhaps all Canon Camcorders at any cost!The IRIS is stuck in the low light setting like many others have posted.Search CNET and other forums as well for many other reports of this problem.Canon Customer Service has been very poor in responding to thisand say that this is an unknown problem! You will have to shell outalmost the cost of the camcorder to get this repaired or otherwiselive with a bad paper-weight.
1,"Open iris has exposure stuck, can't adjust exposure","Do not buy this camera!I believe that this is a firmware problem of some sort, though I could be wrong. Whenever I am affected by this problem, I can no longer hit the Exposure button to adjust the exposure. My current work-around is to play a video (tape or card), and go back to the record mode. Very annoying, and it might not work later on."
2,I'm having the same problem!,I've experienced the same bad iris problem too after several years of normal functioning. Canon wanted me to send the camera in for repair--has anyone else actually had the problem fixed by Canon? If so how much did it cost and did it fix the problem? I'm wondering if I should get it repaired or just buy a new camera.
3,Bad Iris - a suggestion,"I bought mine used, and after a month or so it started developing the now seemingly notorious iris problem that makes the image look as if you're somewhere in the vicinity of the South Pole. The over-exposed image can only mean that the iris is stuck in a wide open position, as other reviewers have said. It happens about 25& of the time when I turn it on, and the only way to fix it is to take the battery out for a few minutes, then put it back in (what Canon refers to as ""resetting the camera""). I suggest everyone else who doesn't feel like paying a ridiculous amount of money for repair to try the same approach.Iris issue aside, this is a good camera for the price. Low light performance isn't great, but I do a lot of closeup work with a 75W key light, and the footage looks pretty nice (no noticeable grain)."
3,Canon Optura 20: recurring iris problem,"I should have known what to expect...this appears to be a fundamental design/component issue. When I first shopped around for this unit in Dec 2003, the display unit at the Best Buy had a washed out picture. Yet, I purchased based on reviews. I would give it 5 stars then. I experienced the ""iris problem"" with washed out picture in Jan 2005, just 1 month after warranty expiration. Sent unit to Canon, with a letter expressing my disappointment and disgust, since I had previously bought Canon SLRs and liked the quality. Surprise, they fixed it free of charge! However, have the same problem again. I guess I will have to pay this time. Next time, Sony. My Sony CCD101 Hi-8 purchased in 1991 gave almost 12 years of hassle free service."
2,Great... while it works,"Count me with the Bad Iris Brigade.I've babied my Optura 20 for three years, and now it's suddenly stuck in low-light mode. The exposure and shutter speed will not change, neither through the menu, the recording mode, nor through the exposure button. I've searched ""optura 20"" ""iris stuck"" on a few search engines and am disheartened to read that many other Optura-ites have experienced the same problem and an expensive estimate from the folks at Canon... and then no help.While it worked, this camera was great. It was light, easy to handle, easy to figure out, and the picture was crispy and nice. I bought the accesory mic and was happy with that, too.Now it's just a lovely paper weight. What a shame."
1,Slipshod Manufacturing,"Received the set this morning and have already arranged for its return. The workmanship was very disappointing -- splits in the handle lines, rough edges that catch on your hand, and obvious cuts in the metal. Every single piece had a defect. This is a Mikasa quality control problem, not an Amazon problem. I will be trying a different manufacturer.UPDATE: I caved in and ordered a replacement set. It arrived today(earlier than expected, BTW), and I am relieved to say that the set is flawless. Hooray!"
5,Fantastic everyday dinnerware,"My wife and I have owned this set of dinerware for over 6 years. It looks as good as the day we brought it home from the store. The design is timeless, and the feel of it is perfectly balanced. I can't tell you how many complements we receive on our dinnerware, and our guests are not the type who would normally comment on such things. I highly recommend this to anyone considering a dinnerware purchase."
5,Outstanding,"This is one of the best books I ever read and I am very much a senior citizen. I liked it so much that I bought it as a gift for family and friends and most of them shared my opinion. It is beautifully written, and the subject matter is most interesting."
4,Watch for pricing,"I just looked up the Mikasa Dune flatware on Mikasa.com, and they have the hostess set priced at $34.99, so Amazon's ""bargain"" price is not such a bargain."
2,Dune flatware falls flat,"Have had this set for over 5 years and have been disappointed with the quality. Within a year of use, all utensils started developing rust spots and look terrible. After doing a little research I find they are 18/8, which is probably why they have not held up. I will be replacing them soon and will make sure my replacement set is 18/10."
4,Just a little off the top please,"So some people may complain that this doesn't sound like the Oranger that they love from five years ago or some crap. Don't listen to these goofballs. And don't be frightened off by the 'peculiar' album cover, this record is killer.The band has sliced a little pschedelic pop off the top and rounded the corners with some good ole fashion whiskey rock n' roll. They group has developed a serious duel guitar assualt and the melodies are addicitve as heck. The record starts out with ""Crooked in the Weird of the Catacombs"" which is a nice way to take the tempo of the record up a notch early on. Other highlights ""Crones"" (killer chorus) ""Garden Party for the Murder Pride"" (serious air guitar) and ""Radiowave"". I wish I had an extra hand so I could give 'er three thumbs up. Seriously. Well, not so serious that I would pursue a surgery, but if I had the extra limb, I would definitely put it to good use for this record."
4,Rumor has it...,"...that Oranger is working in a new project. I hope that's true. Although this last album is not as epic as Shutdown the Sun or as interesting overall as some of their other works it does hold up well. Check out the weird lead whatever-that-instrument-or-device is effects on 'Garden Party...' ; 'Radio Wave' hits the ground running; 'Crones' has a really nice feel to it; 'Whacha Holden' and 'Haeter' hearkens back to earlier Oranger stuff...; if there was a such thing as an Oranger single or radio-hit it would be 'Target You By Feel'... get this album if you love quirky, monumental, power pop, alt-rock then grab any other Oranger releases that you can still get your hands on - before they are all gone..."
5,hooorahhh!,"Just want to pass the message on that this good man, has written an excellent book! Through his crafty creation of dramatic situations we get to see what it really would be like to serve at His right hand and help people everywhere. I totally loved both books in the series and look foward to the next one! I am an avid reader and writer, and can say I aspire to write someday like you! (not to mention, live in the Akron area!) :)Hoooooraahhhh! Let's here it for our military forces!"
4,Shoot 'em up without anyone getting hurt,"The Firebrand team uses non-lethal weapons, so you get all the bombs, guns, and knives without anyone getting killed. Good deal.The plot is very simple, the characters are caricatures, and it is amazingly predicatable. Nothing happens that you can't figure out 50 pages beforehand.I liked it anyway. It is light and easy reading with a good theme. I already ordered #2 in the series."
5,FANTASTIC,"I've always enjoyed military fiction but as a Christian, struggle to find writers who share my beliefs. Jefferson Scott has created a FANTASTIC work of fiction in Operation Firebrand. It was a page-turner from the moment I picked it up. Highly recommended!!!!"
4,"Beautuful book, perfect for a coffee table","This book gives you general information on popular English roses. Many books of this kind are too specific on growing the plant and unattractive for a non-enthusiast,but well-balanced descriptions in this book are fun to read for everybody. The author gave a short explanation on the name of each rose, and you will not be bothered to try to remember a Shakespearean character whom the rose was named after. The reason I did not give 5 stars is that the visual info on the bloom is not enough. Most of the photos show only the plant in full bloom and does not help you to imagine how they appear in the process of blooming."
4,Charming --,"Very nice book -- a little out of date. I grow Austin roses, and many of the new varieties are not included, however there was good information on care and maintenance from David Austin himself, much of which I had not been familiar with before."
5,"Fascinating, comprehensive, and beautifully written","My husband and I have read a number of books to help us fully understand what it means to be a future parent and what we can do to prepare for a successful and healthy conception. Dr. Rosen's book offered us an incredibly comprehensive view of the issues -- everything from practical tips on nutrition and lifestyle to explorations of the emotional links to your future child's soul. You'll find pearls of wisdom in this book that your own parents probably never even considered! It's well written, easy to follow, and the questions at the end of each chapter allow you to tailor the information to suit your unique needs."
5,Excellent SpongeBob Toy for older kids,"My son who is now 8 absolutely loves these. We have both of these Spongebob plug and play games, he has been living the Spongebob stage for a few years now and he plays this alot and we haven't had any problems besides the batteries die-ing (he plays it too much like I said)."
5,very satisfied,"Bought this lock last spring to lock my garden tool shed; recently unlocked the shed for the first time after a long New England winter and the lock operated as smooth as when I first bought it, other then the yellow color fading the lock looks and functions as if it were brand new. No sign of rust, nothing is sticking, I'm very satisfied and impressed with it.2-27-11, Update - Lock is still as easy to unlock as when first bought."
5,Easily one of the best albums of the past decade!,"any fishbone album is an eclectic selection of musical styles, and Reality is Fishbone at their artistic peak. A definate must have. Shout out to all the nuttmegalicious soldiers!"
5,Nutmeg...,"When this album came out, punk was still a slight rumble under the red carpet, hair metal was still king, grunge would be ushered in on it's heels. Quite honestly, for music/pop culture,it wasn't the best or worst of times, it was in that time frame, one of the only places it could've happened, Fishbone unleashed ""The Reality Of My Surroundings"", an album that could easily be considered a conceptual masterpiece...Eh, aside the hype, it's a great record.There was the fusion of punk, reggae and funk, the same blue print Sublime, 311 and many other would-be admirers would adopt, in my somewhat zealous opinion, I don't think any of the bands listed got to explore the same free spirited energy as creatively and most of them come off as pale imitations in comparison.This isn't their only good album either, they still put on amazing live shows, so check em out if you can."
3,The point is made...,"I love Fishbone. I love the combination of funk, metal, ska and psycho-infused madness (Angelo Moore plays a mean theremin!!). I also completely agree with (most) of their views on society and racism. On top of that, they are one of the best acts I have ever seen live. So why only three stars? Because despite some absolutely infectious tunes on this disc there are a few tracts which are down right unlistenable. For example, the two tracts about junkies make a very powerful, important point - don't become a junkie. Ok I get it. But the sounds of puking, yelling and vile profanity make the point the first time you hear it, then you never want to hear these tracks again. Why would you? You don't need that lesson over and over again. Alas, I don't play the disc much, and when I do it's just to listen to a few cuts. My advice to Fishbone: stick to the music on the cd's and save the heavy non-musical critiques on society for your live shows; but without the puking sounds."
2,In Reality,"The reality is that Fishbone isn't much good. Part Metal, part ska and part funk, the resulting potpourri is more grating than joyful. It's a pity, because I met him once, if I liked the guys music I might enjoy the memory more."
4,"""Man From UNCLE"" music used on this episode of ""Daniel Boone""","My wife was just watching an old ""Daniel Boone"" episode on TV. Suddenly, I noticed what sounded a lot like ""Wild Bike"" from Morton Stevens' suite on the The Man from U.N.C.L.E. soundtrack CD. Sure enough, IMDb informed me that Morton Stevens had scored ""Cain's Birthday: Part 1"", which was the episode she was watching. It was shot in 1965, so it seems that Mr. Stevens recycled this piece of UNCLE music for Dan'l.The Man from U.N.C.L.E. [Original Television Soundtrack]"
5,Purchase of Daniel Boone DVD,I bought this as a gift. Unable to find anywhere else.I know to check Amazon.com for future purchases of anything to find any item quickley.
1,Horrible DVD,"Don't bother to buy this. Curt cant play Young riffs better than you probably already can, and he didnt even bother to get a Gibson SG and right amp settings for the occasion. These lessons wont teach you ANYTHING about Angus/Malcolm Young techniques. He just plays some riffs you can find on hundreds of TAB sites and thousands of books."
1,Big dissapointment,"Bad picture, bad sound, horrible teacher. Buy tablaturebooks and listen/look at AC/DC themself to get it right. The rythmsection where you`re supposed to play solos along witb, is just curt jaming away whit diffrent ways of you shook me. Buy ""jam whit AC/DC"" from the booksection instead."
1,"Ok, but less than impressed","I bought the definitive ac/dc tab book that has like 85 of thier songs in it, learned a lot of the songs, and then bought the ac/dc guitar method dvd. I couldn't wait to be able to play along to the songs to know if I was doing it all right. When I watched it, he shows you different ways of playing the songs that are much easier, but once again, you can only watch him play it or watch the tabs and hear it. If you cant play any ac/dc then you can get it if you want to but I wouldn't suggest it. If you can read tabs, then get the definitive ac/dc tab book. It is alot better bang for your buck. Overall, Curt Mitchell is a great guitar player but not as good of a teacher."
1,Waste of your time.,Curt Mitchell doesn't know how to teach anyone.You're buying a DVD which shows a rather unprofessional guy play a set of random ACDC licks. He doesn't offer any insight at all on how to play these licks or the theory that goes behind them.
3,does the job but could be better,"I purchased three of these for my 3 children's beds. So far I've put 2 on 3 of the beds and the one zipper was already separated from the one cover. The mattress cover still does protect the mattress because it's held in place even without the zipper since it goes on like a zipped pillowcase for a mattress. However, if purchased for bed bug or dust mite protection then the zipper needs to be more functional. I used these over a dust mite cover so I did not need that functionality."
1,Shoddy; ripped zipper seam,"Arrived with a 1-foot long rip along the zipper-vinyl seam, and the smallest amount of pressure caused it to rip further. Manufacturer needs to bond it better, or sew it rather than glue it. Another 3"" tear in the top-side vinyl appeared less than a week later, with only a two-year-old's weight on it.(This item was returned for a full refund - thank you Amazon.)"
1,Should have read 1 star reviews,"I only read the good reviews (don't know why, I usually read a variety of reviews). The mattress cover was not even all the way sewn together at the end of the zipper, i noticed this after it ripped halfway through zipping it up. On the positive side amazon has made the return process very easy and we will be getting all our money back. So thumbs up amazon, thumbs down mattress cover."
1,Terrible quality,"I thought it was great when I first got it, but it tore within a week of usage. Poor quality; do not recommend."
4,vinyl matress cover,Careful... I like that it encloses the whole mattress but it will tear if you aren't careful. We duct taped one spot...
1,Vinyl Mattress Protector 6 Gauge - Zippered (9' depth) Twin Size,"I was really excited about the product and it shipped fast. I placed the cover on the twin mattress. I was zipping up the zipper and the zipper detached from the plastic. Not satisfied, was not made well."
2,Not very good,"This item ripped at the seams immediatly. It works otherwise has advertised, but not very effective when ripped at the zipper seam. I do not recommend this product. Not worth any price, as it is useless."
3,Vinyl mattress protector,I carefully put this product on my son's twin mattress and it tore by the zipper. It was a snug fit but I was very careful; quite disappointed in the quality.
2,Vinyl Mattress Cover,"The mattress cover I recieved is 80"" x 37"" x 6""...not the 9"" depth I expected. I have not opened it because I intend to return it but the plastic seems very thin. I was hoping for something that would hold up better than the ones I've purchased at Walmart."
3,Easily tears,"Product works-keeps moisture off mattress. I was disappointed in how easily the product tears. I put the cover on my mattress very carefully & it still ripped by the zipper. Luckily I had zipper at the bottom of the bed and I don't think accidents will happen this low on the mattress. Other than that, for the price, is a decent product."
2,Poor Quality,"The brand new protector ripped while I was putting it on my son's bed. The quality was not great and it tore easily. I guess you get what you pay for. I thought 6 gauge would be thick enough, but it was super thin. My husband said it was garbage and I should return it. I decided to keep it because I did not want the hassle of returning the product. I put the torn side on the bottom of the bed, so it works for now. I am not happy with my purchase, so I wanted to write this review."
1,Highly Disapointed,"I needed a cover for my sons new mattress and wanted to buy a higher quality product then what was available locally.This cover doesn't feel any heavier and arrived with (2) rips, one at each end of where the zipper terminatesSave your time/money"
1,Ehhhh,Quite a lot of work to get the mattress into it. Need two people to accomplish this and it tore on the sides in the process. Did not last even a day. It ripped on the top within the next day. So was not worth the ten bucks I sent on it. Tempted to just get a tarp and use instead.
4,Does exactly what I need,"I bought this cover for my 2-year old son's mattress. It fits great and it's durable. It has already saved me from having to scrub urine and vomit out of the mattress, and it wipes clean very easily. While it's not a perfect product, it does exactly what is required for the price. I was wary because so many others said the plastic has an unbearable odor, but it's really no worse than a brand new shower curtain and it only took about a day before it aired out enough that I could no longer smell it."
5,Mattress,"The mattress, I order for my client came in the time frame that was stated. In addition , I like the color of the mattress and that it's vinyl I haven't had any complaints from his caregiver therefore, the mattress is doing what it's supposed to do.Thank youClaudette K. Thomas"
2,Rips very easily,"Despite being careful fitting this, it has already ripped twice, once at each end. Because the tears are at the end, then it is still useable for us (being used for a small child with occasional ""accidents"") but would not be any use if we were using to protect against bedbugs as some other people seem to be using it.I am disappointed with the quality of it and would not buy it again"
4,great for keeping bed bugs away!,I have used these covers for years and have had no problems what so ever. Great for keeping bed bugs away. I have guest houses and have to be careful of insects.
3,Vinyl Mattress Protector 6 Gaugge-Zippered ( 9' depth) Twin Size,"This thickness of plastic tends to tear very easily. Used one each of the same size to cover both a matress and box spring . Should have used a larger size for the box spring, but they both tore. Possibly usable but takes two people easing the cover on while being extremely careful not to tear the product, if this is all you can afford to buy for your purpose."
1,hopes and expectations :),I had pretty big hopes for this item and was excited to get it. Upon its delivery I eagerly opened up the package and was horrified once i discovered the cheap quality of the product. This protector has a zipper on it which is attached only by some type of poor glue. A baby's breath would be strong enough to completely rip the zipper from the vinyl cover.
2,you get what you pay for,"the vinyl cover didn't completely cover my twin sized mattress...there's about 6 inches of mattress at the head of the bed that isn't covered...the cover also tore as I was putting it on the matress...all things considering tho, it does cover what needs to be covered and is serving it's purpose...(I'm in the process of transitioning a toddler from night time pull-up use to no pull-ups at all)..."
4,nothing good or bad,"This is our second one of these we've ordered, since our young boys have a bunk bed.It's a nice product. Prompt delivery. Nothing especially good or bad.The vinyl is sufficient for expected uses, but will rip if a boy jumps on the bed enough. Packing tape fixes a small rip."
2,Ripped on first use,I purchased this for a standard sized hospital bed. It was barely long enough to fit over the mattress although the dimensions stated matched my mattress. I zipped it up and the pad immediately ripped along the zipper. Was expecting something that I could use more than once and be able to launder.
2,broke as I put it on,"I was excited about this product, until I put it on the bed. As I zipped it up the zipper pulled completely away from the rest of the protector. Not only is it not waterproof at the seams, the seam didn't even hold up to the product being put on the bed! I called the 100% Customer Satisfaction number to let my complaint be heard--I had to leave a message and it said if someone did want an exchange it'd cost $10 s/h. Obviously that wasn't a problem for me since I bought on Amazon. I just left it on my daughter's bed since accidents happen on the middle of the bed and I'd just had a baby and was too tired to go through the return/exchange process. It seems a touch thicker than your average protector, however my wedding ring ripped a small hole in it on two separate occasions as we changed the sheets."
5,great deal,"I got this mattress protector because we are night time training our 4 year old. It is perfect. I don't think it would fit easily around a standard size mattress, but we have a memory foam mattress that is slightly smaller. I slid on easily and ziped up. And shipping was super fast (got it in 2 days when I only paid for standard shipping). Luckily we got it just in time for flu season. Really easy to wipe down and clean. I was surprised that it didn't really have much of a smell to it since there are so many reviews complaining about the smell. I have really sensitive sense of smell and there wasnt much of a smell and it went away after a few days. Great deal and you cant beat the price!"
3,Ok unless you have a cat,"It's easy to put on the mattress, and isn't too noisy for a kid to sleep on. But if you have cats it's not going to work. The can stick pin holes in it from running on it. Or like my cat totally shredded it in 5 minutes. I assume this would happen with a dog too."
1,Terrible Customer Service - Terrible Product,"This product, I had high hopes for this product because I've had a similar one before. Unfortunately I couldn't see it before I bought it. The seam split after two weeks of use. My elderly father has been very gentle with it, rest assured. I'm pretty disappointed in the whole experience. And I ordered 4. Thank goodness that 3 were cancelled due to being out of stock. My elderly father has not been overly rough with the cover. I can understand an active person perhaps being rough with it and it ripping, but -- come on. I would not recommend this to anybody. Sorry."
2,Poor quality,"This is a tight fit over a twin mattress of average size, and the zipper ripped immediately. Very cheap construction. Not recommended."
4,practical,"I am happy with this item. my cat occasionally wet the bed, and this is perfect to keep the mattress clean."
2,Vinyl mattress cover,"I don't feel this mattress cover was as heavy as others I have purchased. When putting this one on it tore in two places. The price was so good, compared to others I looked at online, so thought I would give it a try. I guess you get what you pay for. I would not buy another one in this thickness."
5,Not Your Average Vinyl Mattress Cover,"Hi yall. This is my third mattress cover. The first two got big rips in them after a few months or a year of use. This mattress cover is completely differently. It isn't crinkly and hard/ difficult to sleep on. It is soft and comfortable, and definitely worth the few extra bucks. It will last for years because it is very durable. Have a good one."
5,Perfect for kids bed,"I didn't want to spend too much. But I wanted a good product for my son's first big boy bed.I read all the reviews, and yes, all plastic items have a smell to them. I opened it and then laid it out for a day before using. It totally got rid of the the strong smell.It totally zipped up around his mattress and felt durable to me. The first night my son's diaper leaked and I was so happy to have that cover. I just took off his sheets and wiped the protector off with a clorox wipe. Great product, no need to spend more money."
4,Disturbing but also heartbreaking,"As many other reviewers said, this was hard to watch for me. These children have been robbed of the beauty and wonder of childhood. This type of brainwashing is wrong on such a deep, dark level. It is so scary that this type of thing exists and I see years of therapy in the future of the children that actually escape.I liked that the filmmaker took a neutral stance throughout the documentary, which let the footage speak for itself. And it had a lot of terrifying things to say."
2,Insanity,"I just watched this insane movie. These poor kids. I really feel sorry for them. This film is about a Bible camp where poor innocent chuldren are forced to do things such as (And this was the most horrifing) pray to a cardboard cut out of Pres. George W Bush. The adults in this fim are crazy. They push their kids to be major Bible thumpers. In fact one insane parent even admitts ""I am raising my children to be warriors for God and the republican party (army)."" These adults totally admit they are trying to brainwash chldrn for Jesus. If you want to see a freak show, watch this film. I was raised christian and I had to go to Bible camp , (Heck me Dad was in charge of it) when I was a kid in the 60's but it was not this crazy. Places like this should be outlawed. You should watch this film to see how scary the ""Right wing Republican Religious Movement"" really is and how they are trying to recruit children. Just another reason the right wing republican religious movement needs to be sstopped."
4,i am horrified,"the scariest movie i have ever seen, i would rather watch every horror movie in the world over and over again than sit through this movie about indoctrination and brainwashing again.""i got saved at age 6 because i just wanted more out of life""""kids. . .when you really think about it science doesn't prove anything""""when i talk to someone that isnt born again i get a kind of icky feeling in my soul""to quote kurt vonnegut why be born again when you can just grow up?"
5,Terrifying,"What a terrifying, haunting, and fascinating look into the slop trough that nourishes the voracious intellectual cancer afflicting this nation."
5,Freaky movie,"I'm sure there are parts that are exaggerated, but it's still a creepy interesting movie. Saw it on a first date, talk about awkward, but really enjoyed it."
4,how true..and sad..and scarey......,"I grew up in an evangelical/apocolyptic type cult..and thats why I wanted/needed to see this film. It all rang so true for me......so sad, and angering, really. Trust me, none of what you are seeing is exagerrated. Bible thumping brainwashing is alive and well in America! I am NOT ""anti-God"" but THIS sort of this is NOT helpful!! Young minds are like sponges, and its the worst form of exploitation to prey upon youthful idealism and innocence in the name of your own agendas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lisa in CT"
4,Well done documentary,"This documentary was done well, covering an issue where it is so easy to pass judgment and create ""bad guys"" and ""good guys."" I feel like the directors adeptly avoided this pitfall and just showed us a slice of life without much commentary.The people in this film are free to believe in whatever they want to believe in. The viewer is also free to decide how we feel about what was happening. The directors avoided making the belief system the object of concern, but rather focused how a religious pulpit is being used for political movement. This was one of the more frightening aspects of this film for me as well as the congregation's implication that logic and science are an enemy of faith.Overall, a very interesting film."
4,Buy It!!!,"I had the opportunity to see Jesus Camp while it was in the theatre. I am going to purchase the DVD, probably several to give away. The movie itself was well done, the filming was beautiful, although the music was a bit heavy-handed at times.The children appeared very normal, very compassionate for other people, and determined that their lives would make a postive difference in this world. They seem determined to not let this nasty world influence them, they were going to influence this world for the better--leave it a better place than they found it.Please understand that the subjects of the movie did not make this film. It was made by people who believe very differently than the subjects do.The subjects have stated that while they agree with the main jist of the film, that it does take things out of context, and that this is only a small slice of their everyday lives.Still, a movie that gives you hope for the future. Buy it."
4,Jesus Camp is brainwashing children!,"In this video I observed children getting brainwashed in the name of God. The Evangilists to me are brainwashing their kids. I admit they have some good religious values, but children have the right to be free to choose. They should not be forced to be holy. That is just as bad as being forced to do bad. Let the child learn and grow. Do not let them be brainwashed into a religious cult. That is exactly what the Jesus Camp is - a religious cult that brainwashes children!"
5,Must see,NO matter your religion this is a must see by anyone. It lets you come to your own conclusion.
4,Not real Christianity,These people have misrepresented Christianity in its entirety. Such individuals require therapy at best. Evangelicals are a different breed all together. All i have to say is that i am glad i am Catholic.
4,Inept attempted hatchet job against evangelical Christianity,"This documentary offers an absorbing look into one particular subculture of Evangelical/Pentecostal revivalism. Against the religious zealots and their program for pre-teen spirituality it poses vignettes of some obscure radio host who ""takes on"" the religious right. (I have no idea who the guy is or who he represents.) If the filmmaker hoped to expose some dark secret or sinister underside of this Church, he failed.Through the use of ominous background music at times and selective use of quotation marks around the phrase ""born again,"" he seems determined to portray the goings on here in a negative light.Thought-provoking whether you are a member of the Religious Right, a liberal or somewhere in between!"
1,"OH, MY GOD!!!!","""A&E;"" is about to run this on their channel. This is a documentary on brain washing the children of America. I felt so bad after watching this. I felt that these poor children were being abused by all that were involved in this documentary.Jeanna : ("
1,Typical liberal stero-types!,This reason I think this movie is a waste of your time is because it was exactly what you would expect from liberal filmmakers from New York. They ae trying to make Christians look weird and scary. Not fair.
3,Powerful but lacks balance and perspective,"This DVD provides a snapshot of one slice of evangelical Christianity. However, those unfamiliar with the wide variety of belief and practice in American Christianity might not realize that the group portrayed represents a small percentage of people of faith. The film fails to explain the many differences (i.e. speaking in tongues) between the Pentecostal sect portrayed and other evangelicals. The film also failed to even hint at the wide diversity of views on the relationship between faith and government. Many Christians believe in changing the world through love and service rather than confrontational politics. I would point to the TotalAxxess radio program as an example of a more generous, humble, loving but still challenging but less political and ""holier than thou"" approach to conservative Christianity."
3,Worthwhile,Kids on Fire head to Devil's Lake as young as six years old to become soldiers in God's army. One third of the world's population is 15 years old or younger. This Jesus survey had kids admitting to liking Christian metal bands. My favorite is Stryper. I thought it was a worthwhile feature.
4,Jesus Camp,"I saw this film in the theaters and what struck me the most was that I saw on the screen in simply a slice of these people's lives. Much of the terminology used in the film is spiritual, Bible jargon, but it was made by the film makers to seem like these people were taking words like ""war"" literally when it was actually referring to ""prayer"". While the movie itself was well done, I think the film makers did not present it without personal bias. In the documentary, they showed what was contraversial and what would sell a movie from an entertainment and shock-value standpoint. The stringing together of certain segments and the dark music give it a sinister feel in parts. The movie, in its presentation, causes people to make a judgement based on a very small glimpse into these people's lives. Even though it may be a documentary, the viewer needs to remember that in order to sell, it also needed to entertain its audience."
3,"Decent movie, but a little bit overdone","Ok, this movie is somewhat decent. However, it is a little overdone. The radio show host is a hack, one who never seems to get real tough questions on his sad radio show. Ring of Fire boy was talking all movie long about the separation of church and state. What he forgot to mention was that this idea came somewhat later when Jefferson was writing the Danbury Baptists while President, not as a member of the constitutional convention. So, it is no certain that the wall between church and state is as steadfast as these individuals would have you believe. Other than that, the movie did a good job of illustrating the culture of these evangelicals, and how this culture shapes their lives. In the end, in spite of the legitimacy extended to the air America hack, this was a good movie. Get it and enjoy."
2,Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....,"Well, I just don't know what to say about this movie. I know Christians are not well represented here. In fact, they are down right tarnished! My opinion of the movie is that it isn't very tasteful. I am a believer and this isn't my style of worship. I found this film very disturbing but on the other hand, I know that to most unbelievers the Gospel is foolishness."
1,Completely Irrelevant Review..but...I just have to say:,I'm watching this movie RIGHT NOW and I just can't stop. It's like a train wreck. I have so much to say...... I totally relate to the people who wrote really long reviews. The horror just never ends. I might have to sleep with the light on tonight because the chubby lady yelling at children who are speaking in tongues very well might give me nightmares.
1,Subject matter bothers me,I cut this DVD up after watching it. Watching a bunch of adults brainwash a bunch of kids is really wrong. That kid that has the mullet cut like Billy Ray needs help. How can he at age 5 have known that he needed god? What a load of tripe.That woman who runs the camp should be locked up.Stupid DVD anyway.
1,Sad,It is so sad kids are abused like this and become addicted to this harmful drug only being happy when they get their fix. It is heartwrenching.
3,Ordered Capsules got Tablets,I ordered capsules and got tablets. Had to keep them because I was running low on them. Shipping was fast.
5,Love these.,Since switching to these I have noticed an increase in my energy levels. I feel that I get more from this multi vitamins than others that I have taken in the past. Will definitely continue to take in the future.
4,"like it, but it doesn't like me","I saw where Dr. Oz recommends taking a good multivitamin and I've used other Source Natural products. This multi got great reviews and I believe I felt better on it. However, it may just be me, but my stomach wouldn't stop being upset and that wasn't worth it. I may try the vitamin again after a while, but I think it's a good product that I just can't tolerate..."
4,Penthouse posers,"Not Penthouse's most erotic fantasy type video, just lots of different girls in Penthouse style poses. Some are very good looking and engage in some arousing dirty talk and what they show you is very explicit. It's just a tad repetitive. The three girl pile up at the end features the hottest models on the tape, and reminds me of more erotic Penthouse productions like Dear Diary or Pets in Paradise. Buy those first, then try this one."
3,A good look at the other side of the war,"I enjoyed reading about what the Revolution was like for ""the bad guys"". As far as fiction goes, this wasn't the best, but for the subject, it was an excellent look at the period and what it was like to fight ""for King and country."""
3,O.k but not Cornwells best,This book is good but unfortunately is not on par with his Sharpe novels or his Warlord chronicals. to a customer below it is the battle of Germantown not Brandywine that this book tells although that was also a British Victory in the American Revolution.
4,New territory for Cornwell,"""Redcoat"" is a well-crafted novel of the American Revolution by a master of historical fiction. While I prefer more recent history, as protrayed in great new novels like ""The Triumph and the Glory"", ""Alleys of Eden"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" reading Cornwell's Napoleonic wars novels or Warlord Chronicles are a great change of pace."
4,"Not as good as Sharpe, but still worth reading","I found that I didn't enjoy the book nearly as much as I do the Richard Sharpe novels. Then again this one was written several years before. It does start out pretty fast paced, but slows down in the middle, but that is due to the fact the winter set in. I liked the ending which followed along the lines of real history and the character development was done well."
2,Cornwell Falls Short With Redcoat,I have read all of Cornwell's Sharpe series including the books that have only been released in the U.K. so it was with great excitement that I began reading this book. Sharpe fans will instantly see that the story lacks the character development in other Cornwell novels. In addition it is usually easy to overlook minor historical inacurracies in Cornwell's other books but in Redcoat they stick out like a sore thumb. I was dissapointed in the end also with the main character's actions. Maybe since this book was written for an American audience the author felt it neccessary to write the ending to meet their tastes. The result though is a novel that failes both the reader and the author.
5,Redcoat Review,"I purchased this book and while I have not read it yet, the author is one of my favs, so over the holidays I will probably sit down and enjoy great days of reading."
5,very underated,"this is by far cornwell's most undrated book. it is a hidden gem. because the sharpe's series and the starbuck chronicles are so hugely successful,and because it was never made into a series redcoat is often forgotten. redcoat is different from other cornwell. there is still the stories within the story. there are no real enemies like an obadiah hakeswill, but vane and scammell are pretty good ememies nonetheless. sam gilpin is a hero that could rival richard sharpe. what's most refreshing being an american, is to see the british side of the war, which is never told in the american history books. it was so interesting. william howe is a very likeable character. this is a great book, unfortunately there weren't any more."
4,Cromwell - Continuing to Prove He Is a Master Storyteller,"The master storyteller again takes the reader into the past to see life as a soldier The British soldier is the hero of many of his tales, from Stonehenge through Wellington's Sharpe series. This story is one that allows the reader see life in the redcoat... with lots of real history thrown in. An exciting story with interest thrown in from the American side of the pond."
4,classic cornwell,"Bernard Cornwell has a tendancy to write the same story with different characters, but still make them and the story interesting. Redcoat, which seems to be a stand alone novel is no exception. Hey, I read all the Sharpe stories and didn't get tired of them. Yes, the batttlefield graphic can be repetitive, but Cornwell's easy style make it a good read. Anyone with a historical background will love the details."
4,An excellent read.,"A friend asked me to read this for her and give her my general thought of it. I admit that I wasn't too excited. It took a while to get into, but once you get drawn in, it is magical. You are really there in those war-torn fields and the small, dank rooms. You can easily sympathize with Sam and the others. The characters are all well rounded, and the plot moves at a nice pace once you get going. Another reviewer also said that the romance is nice, but takes a backseat to the actual plot. I like that, and really think it helps this great story."
3,I've read 'em all,"and this and ""Stonehenge"" are the weakest of a very fine writer's work. ""Redcoat"" seems to spend more time talking about the social calender in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War than the war itself. One thing I love about the Sharpe series, the finest series of its kind ever written, is the minutae of the life of a soldier. Much of that is missing from this book."
1,Worst timeclock ever,Been an electrician for 30 years and I have never seen a worse timeclock than this one. The instructions are horrible and I've never had a harder time programming any piece of equipment. If it didn't cost so much it would be in the trash right now. I have used Intermatic many times in the past but this one was a mistake. FYI this was not purchased from Amazon.
3,Durable but not perfect,"This is a good durable lock as it should be, but I have issues getting the shackle into the lock. I have to jiggle the key a little and nudge the shackle to get it to fit. This is a straightforward mechanism so seems unacceptable that this should be an issue. Whatever happened to quality control. Wasn't worth the effort to return."
3,Misleading Description,"This review is a repeat of another item I received today. This is a nice set. However, in the description it said, ""Imported"". Considering it was listed under ""Creative Irish Gifts"", I was under the impression that it was made in Ireland. Unfortunately, it was Made in China.Disappointed in the way this company describes their items."
3,tea set,"there were no measurements for this set but it looked like a cute gift for my granddaughterI live in another country so rely on descriptions and reviews for my purchasesHowever, I was very disappointed to learn that the cups were very small and the tea pot holds very little. If they had given any idea as to size it would have been helpful."
3,what happened?,"sometimes the game just stops and a box comes up saying that theres a problem and has to close,kida like windows explorer does once in a while.so ive learned to save quite often!"
5,Best Silverware I Ever Bought!,"I bought a set for my girlfriend and she LOVES IT! The pieces keep their mirror finish even after repeated dishwasher cycles and daily use!Rvery piece feels natural, comfortable, and perfectly suited to its purpose and guests often remark at its beauty.This is the perfect silverware for us."
3,Interesting to see WWII from a female perspective,"So Proudly We Hail has all the elements of a good movie. Intense drama, romance, and some teary moments of sacrifice. Good performances by all, especially a supporting perfomance from Veronica Lake, and the oscar nominated performance by Paulette Goddard. Nice to see some great characters actors from that period like Barbara Britton and Mary Treen to name a few. A good movie for sentimental types...."
5,So Proudly We Hail,"There are many things that make this a really terrific film: Claudette Colbert does a great job displaying a wide range of emotions. A World War II movie that focuses on women and their role--from a realistic stand point. All of the supporting players. It's also important to remember that this film was produced when the outcome of the war was far from decided. Also, it was based on diaries kept by some of the nurses caught on Baatan in 1942. One can see why this would have been such a morale boost to all those who saw it during the war."
3,"Schmaltz, but effective.","Surgery without surgical masks. I don't think so.The story has good bits and pieces. But there is one thing you should never have in a good movie-- someone explaining how they feel in the beginning. Veronica telling about why she hated the Japs is less compelling that a personality we learn to know through actions and reactions.It's treating your audience as being stupid--which they aren't.Another no-no is explaining to one person the trials of another and coupling it with the situation. It's like trying to sell you a used car. The viewer has to learn for themselves. Otherwise it becomes redundant and boring.The remark one of the nurses made--something about the war and what they were doing for mankind-- wears a little thin. You figure that when the movie played in the theater there was probably someone in the lobby selling war bonds.Glorifying war is all this is. And as some character in a movie once said, ""There aint much glory is seeing a man with his guts hanging out!"""
1,Do your own research...,"The book often talks about provocative policies at the University of Maryland at College Park, without siting any sources. The information here about the school's outlawing of ""leering and ogling, licking lips or teeth"" as part of Sexual Harassment policy is innacurate. The authors apparently took this from a training manual, and is NOT outlawed, much less campus policy (I called the President's Legal Office to find this out). I wonder how many of the other unreferenced policies are just false!"
1,A little accuracy would be nice...,"Yet another one-note, one-thought attack on American universities and colleges. I was a little surprised to see the description of my own school, Bowdoin College, in the book (pp. 93, 147, 217), because the description given didn't match what I knew of Bowdoin's policies -- and, indeed, their description has nothing to do with Bowdoin's official policies on harassment, as published on Bowdoin's Web site. One wonders how many similar cases can be documented, given the lack of referencing of their claims about such speech codes. Their apologie for the activities of racist organizations like the Pioneer Fund (pp. 136-143) is similarly unfortunate. It's too bad, because a balanced book on this topic would be very useful -- but this ain't it."
1,Paranoia,"This book is a product of reactionary backlash. The authors are driven by their liberatarian fundamentalism to reduce every issue to a simplistic, formulaic level. They have no sense of historical complexity or the dilemmas of balancing different claims and imperatives. Instead of trying to take the true measure of the challenges that universities face in the present situation, they trade in the cliches of American libertarianism. Instead of exercising their skills and education to give the reading public a balanced view, they feed the paranoia of the ""conspiracy theory"" crowd by presenting isolated instances in the most skewed and one-sided ways."
1,Right Wing Nonsense,"This book is a prime example of Ralph Reed's ""stealth conservatism."" It offers views from the very far right while insisting that it puts forth a moderate, even progressive viewpoint. If you believe that Christina Hoff Sommers is a feminist, you'll believe that these two are civil libertarians."
5,Accurate beyond belief,"I just completed my first year of post graduate work at a major public univeristy in the Eastern USA. I used to think that attacks on ""political correctness"" were just a cover for some dying type or racism and sexism. Well, after a natioanlly known figure was invited-then-disinvited to speak on campus, I began to air some doubts I had about the tolerance level around here. A peer of mine then lent me this book. My only comments are that the book is well written, well researched, and matches what I have witnessed on this campus. A must read for those concerned about intellectual freedom in this nation. (Note: In order to protect my position at hte university, I felt the need to post this anonymously. A sad commentary indeed)"
4,a good primer for the beginner,This is a great book to get you started on more serious writing about paleoanthropology. Shreeve gives consideration to many theories without taking sides. His writing is clear & easy-going. I would have loved more illustrations & maps.
4,A excellent introduction to the Neandertals,"I intially checked this book out from the local public library, but liked it so much I bought it. I picked up this book knowing next to nothing about this subject and came away with a consuming interest in it. Shreeve, weaves a great story as much about academic backbiting and squabbling as about the Neandertals. He gives a strong overview of the competing theories of human origins as well and talks to all sorts of scientists, not just anthropologists and archaeologists but population geneticists and molecular biologists as well. He gives all sides their two cents worth, but isn't afraid to criticize esteemed scientists for sloppy thinking either. This book is ideal for someone new to the field who wants to understand all the sides of the debate."
1,Not well made,"This bag is leather,but It's paper thin and began to fall apart 3 days after I received it!"
3,nice bag,"This is a nice, large handbag that was worth the $10 I paid for it. I was disappointed to see the lining inside the large pocket is already riping though. I guess you get what you pay for though."
2,Disappointed with purchase,"Was very disappointed with the bag. It's very flimsy especialy the straps which is rather narrow and very soft. It therefore sags when you carry it on your shoulder if it is not completely full. Then it does look awkward and bulky.On the other hand it is deep and roomy,good for lightweight shopping, but unfortuneately cannot stand firm unless full. The only consolation is that, it's a cheap bag and the quality is reflective of the price paid."
2,disappointed,I thought this would be his piano playing and was very disappointed to learn that it was vocal. Not that I have a problem with his voice; it's just that an early cd I heard of his piano music was fabulous and I am trying to find it.
5,A new voice in women's fiction,WHILE THE DAFFODILS DANCED weaves a poetic tale of a young woman who gives up a child for adoption and learns to live with the consequences of her actions. All of the characters in this book come across with the reality of their human foibles. The heroine's journey is mirrored in the field of wildflowers that she paints onto her canvasses. This is real life told from an artist's point of view. A lovely read.
4,Hoop Dreams,"Hoop Dreams is about two kids who are looking for the best thing in Highschool, a state championship and Not just any State championship, but a basketball one. The two kids in the book are Aurther Agee and William Gates. They both get into St. Joesph's, but then Aurther gets kicked out because his parents can't pay the bills. Later on he Aurther gets into a smaller school called Marshall. In their senior year, Williams team gets beatin in the Semi Fimals to go into the championship round to play Marshall, but Aurthers team goes on and wins the whole thing.this a great book for anyone wholoves basketball guy or girl. It's a book that as soon as you get it in your hands and starts reading it that you can't put it down."
3,Something I Longed for,"Something I long for in WHAT WE ALL LONG FOR is the passionate engagement with a love of solitude and the genius with language that you find in so many of Brand's other books, for instance this inspired description of when she's living alone in her little house far out in the country in THE MAP TO THE DOOR OF NO RETURN, where she lives among neighbours who love ""country music's lonesome and outlaw tenors"" and where she scrutinizes ""each window's drama of trees and sky"", and on summer nights lies ""in the very, very dark of the country, the smell of pine and cedar around me, the very quiet of the bush pressing in, and I listen till I fall asleep.""Or when she meditates on the relevance and nature of identity, on her Caribbean childhood, on flame trees that are ""at their torrid best in the dry season.""But in WHAT WE ALL LONG FOR I found the novel's landscape (cityscape) too noisy, too populated, too busy for the arid world she ordinarily gives such a depth of emotion to."
1,Ok if you've got a PHD in Geography,Very disappointed that there was hardly anything about the US. Most of the maps you cannot determine which present day country you are looking viewing. These maps are beautiful but not at all what I expected.
4,SWEETNESS!!!,"Okay, this isn't the most innovative skiing video ever, but it covers important parts of freeskiing hisory and how a rebel skier helped revolutionize it.There's nothing sicker than a McConkey invert off of cliffs and the hugest switch fronts and backs i've ever seen.There is also a cool BASE jump in Canada at midnight with Olympic god Jonny Mosely as the get-away driver...Although most of the music in this is from Surfdog Records, it isn't all bad.And there's nothing funnier than watching a white [guy] try to break dance."
2,Agree with Edgy,"I wish I had seen Edgy's review before purchasing this DVD. I was interested in a movie with skiing footage. This has about 25% ski footage, 25% base jumping, and about 50% stupid skits."
2,Edgy Teen Appeal,"I purchased the vid given the hipe and because McConkey is an awesome skier. Having watched this back to back with some of other ski flicks... my impression was that the film was not of the same standard (skiing or filming).The thing that bothered me, and everyone of the adults (expert skiers) in the crowd was the immature non-skiing footage. It really detracted from what could have been an entertaining movie."
4,Must have for Dream Syndicate Fans,"This expanded CD has lots of good extra songs from one of the late great undiscovered 80s guitar bands. A good substitute for Tell Me When its Over the best of CD which is out of print. My only gripe is that it doesn't have my fav. DS song 'Bullet with My name on It' but oh well, still great. Days of Wine and Roses is still as vital today and even sounds kind of like that LA sound is really coming back."
4,Best Velvets Album Ever By A Band That's Not The Velvets,"While I'm not as fanatical as many other reviewers of this album, I still like it a lot and recommend it to any Velvet Underground fan. The main reason I'm writing is to share a little information that may be of interest to hardcore Dream Syndicate fans. Prior to transfering to UCLA and forming the Dream Syndicate, Steve Wynn and Kendra Smith were students at U.C. Davis, where they fronted a band called the Suspects. The Suspects made a 45 RPM 7"" single. 2 Songs. So if you're a collector of all things related to the Dream Syndicate, there's another item for you to try to track down."
4,I love the processor/blender but...,"I wish the processor came with a recipe book. I have many uses for the appliance, but would have many more if it came with some recipes or even usage tips to go with the juicer, processor, and blender. There is absolutely nothing to go on except for some recommended chopping speeds in the user manual. I couldn't even find anything on the web! Other than that, I love the various speeds and blades. Also, cleanup seems to be easy so far (except the juicer - grapes get messy). Carrots seemed to stain the shredding blade holder (it's white), but the orange stains faded within hours and it looks as good as new. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a multi-tasker."
4,ULTIMATE COMP !,"Discography cd of this seminal OI !/skinhead band.Starts out with 15 early songs of the band that are plain,square,anthemic skinhead rock'n roll,with great guitar crunch and a simplistic approach that is somewhat boring and repetitive on some of them,but the flow of the music is exciting resulting in a great listen.The next songs,Roi Pearce's later spinoffs of the band (The Warriors and The Resort) are more structured,metallic tinged,demolishing rock n roll,and here is where the real excitement begins.The sound of the whole cd ,on the other side,lacks upper treble (no cymbals) and the bottom end is mainly bass guitars with the drums low in the mix,except for the bonus tracks that feature astonishing drumming.I endorse this to a typical early 80's low budget recordingWorth the price because of the addition of the bonus tracks."
1,Shark Cordless Sweeper a Disaster,"I bought the UV 610 several weeks ago and after using it precisely according to diections I deduce that this product is, to be polite, a piece of junk. It demands multiple passes and even then fails every sort of pickup. Its dust catcher broadcasts dust. Its brushes become entangled with dog hair, etc. and are all but impossible to clean. Its rush of air exhaled from its lead edge blows much of that which itintends to collect away. All in all, it is a failure. I have replaced it with Dirt Devil's cordless which works wonderfully, and is less expensive. I will donate the Shark to someone I dislike.Martin Last, Montréal, Canada"
3,good for just a sweap,"When I first bought this product, I thought it was excellent, and it was. It picked up everything and anything, even when I put it on carpet because I was too lazy to get my vacuum cleaner out. The only problem that I had is that the rotating brush got clogged with hair and other object so now it doesnt really get everthing off the floor - items such as human hair/cat hair/stringy things dont get through the rotating brush and into the part that holds all the other junk from the floor.. The con about the product is that I have only had the product for about 4 months now and I only have a one bedroom apt (not a lot of carpet or hard floors at all) and I already have to replace the rotating brush/side brush."
5,A most amazing product!,It does everything the infomercial says and more. I have both hardwood floors and carpets. This extraordinarily lightweight(can be held easily with a pinky) has taken the place of my high end vacumn. Virtualy picks up anything in it's way. I have pets that knock over their food bowls and there are dog food pellets everywhere a once over and they are gone- Much better than any vacumn I've owned. It looks so low tech but works like a charm!!!!!
2,Pfft... Not the quality you'd expect for the price,"Bought two. One broke inside a week. The other lasted 6 months - about average for our operation. Neither picked up particularly well when they were working. They certainly didn't pick-up better than any of the $40 vacs that we'd used before. The Shark Sweepers look like they are made of a higher grade material because they're silver in color; don't be fooled, it's plastic and light-weight plastic at that. I won't buy another."
2,"Worked great, then.....","I bought the Shark Cordless Sweeper after watching an info-mercial. It worked great...then it just died. No matter how much I charge it, it just doesn't work. Thankfully I was talked into buying an extra battery pack when I called in to order.. I guess that should have told me something. Let's see how long this one lasts."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Idea","I got hooked on the infomercial. I went out to the local target to buy it. After the 24 hours of charging it for the first time I powered up the baby. It worked alright.. I was dissappoint, and I had lost my receipt so I couldnt return it. Seems to work only when you pull it, and not push. Also, get progressivelly louder as you use it. The thing is soooo noisy now. And the little corner brush fell off. I think the dog got it. Over all I""m not happy with the purchase."
4,Great &quot;Clean-Up Tool&quot; For Any Floor!,"My husband bought this sweeper for me a few weeks ago, after hearing me talk about wanting to try one several times. My husband was a little concerned about the design, stating that it was just like a simple Bissell push sweeper, only with rechargable batteries. Well he bought it anyway, and how surprised we both were with how well it cleans the floors. Hard floors, carpeted floors, it doesn't matter. This little does a great job! It is not a vacuum, so it is not intended for deep cleaning, but it's great for light surface cleaning. It does scatter light dust, but it does great with most everything else. I do have to clean the rollers quite a bit, but overall I really like this handy little tool."
1,"Loud, loud, loud!",Scatters dust rather than picking it up! Does a great job picking up nuts and bolts as the package photo indicates but can't do much for real dust bunnies on the floors! And it is so loud that you need ear plugs! :(
5,Suprised,"I was very skeptical when purchasing this product. Even more skeptical when I received it, partially due to the fact it was in such a small box and it was very light weight. Well, was I suprised. It's turned out to be an EXELLENT buy. Works wonders on both carpet and bare floors. In fact, it works just as good or better on carpet than many other vacuums I have used. Assembly was a snap. Changing the trash tray is also a breeze. This turned out to be a light weight with heavy weight power. I'm so delighted with it that I am going to purchase 2 more as gifts."
5,My best garage sale find ever!,"Picked this up at a garage sale and love it, love it, love it! I use it everyday to freshen up my carpets! Because it is cordless I can zip through my entire house in about 10 minutes and my carpets look refreshed! It picks up everything except my pet bird's feathers. Don't know why it won't get those. It is so lightweight and zippy my kids can quickly do their own rooms as well.I have read the negative reviews but so far, I just can't relate. I bought this VERY USED sweeper at a yard sale five months ago and it is still going strong."
1,Will not last!,"Even though I could see that this was very cheaply made when I first bought it, I loved the idea of it being so light. It did pick up well, however, even though it hasn't been used a lot, it has now stopped working after a very short time. After being charged, it lasts for about two minutes, so I can no longer use it. Basically, I think this machine is a rip-off. All the people who love it must work for the company!"
1,This is a piece of junk,"Within 3 months, this machine broke down on me. Even when it was brand new, it never perform the way it shown on TV. I will NEVER again purchase anything made by this company. I have never been so digusted with any product as this one before. I am surprise it is still on the market.DO NOT waste your money on it. Stick with the brand name product."
1,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! But otherwise I love it!,"I bought this at Sears and loved it. I have a one-year-old who is pretty messy and I no longer worry about the messes...it is so easy to clean up with this sweeper.However, after owning it for one month, it stopped working and the handle snapped off. Since I did like the product, I took it back to Sears and traded it in for another one. I have had the second one for a month and it has also stopped working and the top of the handle never stayed on properly.As much as I like the convenience of this product, this time I am going to get my money back and by something else."
1,Cheap Junk,"We bought one of these to clean hardwood floors. It sweeps all right and stays charged, but the cheap plastic handle broke off about the third time we used it, and we weren't treating it roughly at all. It's a cheap, junky item. Take a pass."
2,OK at best,"After reading the previous reviews of this product, I ordered it. It is very light and does a decent job of picking up items off carpet, but when it comes to picking up dog hair off tile floors, it is a ""no go!"" Knowing what I do now, I would not have ordered this item. It is DEFINITELY not a 5 star product...`2 stars is about right and 3 stars would be generous in my opinion."
1,Belt not Replaceable... Horrible Customer Service,"Be very careful before buying Shark Vaccum Cleaners or Sweepers. I bought mine and in less than 2 years it started making noise so I started looking for replacement Belt, and guess what.... Shark does not sell replacement belt. Their customer service asked me to send in the whole sweeper with $20.00 for Repairs and $9.99 for S/L, thats what it costs to buy a new one. Customer service is very rude, all they kept telling is its company policy to not sell Belts... what a policy??? The only most consumed part of any Vaccum Cleaners is not replaceable and not available in market. I would never buy a Shark product again..."
1,The biggest waste of money,"I purchased my first Shark and it lasted a few months before the battery would no longer charge. So, I threw it out and went out to buy another one (because I'm stupid that way). I've only had this new one for four months. I keep it clean, including all the garbage that wraps around the roller. Now, it turns on for half a second and the roller won't turn. It will be on the garbage truck come Tuesday. I will never purchase another one of these items again. They are poorly made. And with a full battery, you are lucky if you get 10 minutes out of it. I'd rather go back to basics and use a broom and my vacuum cleaner."
1,NOT AS EXPECTED,"I PURCHASED THIS SWEEPER BASED ON THE TELEVISION ADS I HAD SEEN AND THE REVIEWS, BUT WHEN IT CAME IT HAD NO POWER AT ALL. I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE SAME SWEEPER THAT IS SOLD IN THE TARGET STORES AT THE SAME PRICE HAS 3 SPEEDS AND APPARENTLY MORE POWER. I AM RETURNING THIS ONE AND WILL TRY THE ONE IN THE STORE."
1,It's not worth the price,"It work fine for sometime. But it's battery started losing power after couple of months. After 6 months, it's battery is totally gone. There is no way to replace the battery. So I have decided not to buy any Shark products anymore as some of my friends have similar experiences with Shark products."
1,piece of junk,"Do not buy this sweeper. Save your money and put it toward a real sweeper. When I received my sweeper, I was surprised to see this is just a piece of plastic, sort of like a child's toy and that is what they should sell it as, A TOY! The sweeper lasted through about 10 sweepings, then died. It won't take a charge anymore. The sweeper brush gets loaded with all the hair and dirt so when you are through using it you have to take it apart to clear all the hair etc. from the brush and in the time it takes to do that you could have hand picked the dirt off the floor. Its such a piece of crap I can't even be bothered to send it back for repair! Its not worth the time. I threw my hard earned money away on this!"
1,what do you sweep?,"The first piece of crap I bought from this brand - Shark.You watched how they pick up those things on TV, and I thought, it's good... bought it, and you know what... it only picks up the things that it does on TV, nothing more. What do you have on the floor most of the time? Hair, dust. After a few times you use it you'll find it's not doing its job anymore cuz hair is all tangled on the motor, and you have to spend half an hour to pull your hairs out, I would rather sweep the floor with a broom. When was the last time you have lots of screws and nuts and m&ms on the floor anyway?Afterall, sharks should live underwater, not on our floors."
1,Do Not Waste Your MONEY,"I was surprised when using it the first time... It did what the TV showed. However, I discover that this thing is useless for hair on the floor... the hair also caused this vacuum to make LOUD NOISE... this problem cannot fixed even they sent me a new gear box... Seriously, now I have to live with the loud noise and also I don't think it works as good as the 1st time any more. Do not use this on any surface that has hair...etc... It will kill it!"
5,The best helper for a mom!,I love this sweeper! It picks up everything including pasta and cheerios!!! It is so light and the charge last for a nice long time! My dustbuster never worked like the shark! It is a great tool to have and use!
1,Thumbs Down,I saw this product advertised on television and read reviews and thought it would be great. Out of the box I charged the battery for 20+ hours before trying it. On the commercial it would pick up bolts off the floor but it failed to pick up dog food bits off of my floor. It seemed to perform a little better on carpet but it's really hard to roll on deep pile carpet. For me it wasn't worth the money.
4,Think of it as a dust buster with a handle - LOVE IT,"I have had my Shark cordless for about 6 months and I love it! I have hardwood and area carpets. I actually like it a bit better on my carpets, but it works on hardwood and does not shoot out stuff. It is not a vacuum, it is a quick pick up in between full vacuums. I have to vacuum with a regular vacuum less because of this. Think of it as a dust buster with a handle. I have not had any problem with the battery. Where I keep it, I don't keep it plugged in (although my recolletion is the instructions said you could). I can use it about 5 or 6 times each of about 15 minutes before I need to plug it in and then it seems to only take a few hours to recharge. I got one for my 80 year old Mom (who felt the full Shark vacuum was too heavy) for her townhouse that is wall to wall carpet and so far she loves it."
1,Shark cordless vacuum,"This is the WORST appliance I have ever purchased. It worked well the first month. As instructed I waited till the battery died to recharge it. Once recharged it kept losing the charge. I would turn it on and it would just flash lights at me. I would have to check the belt, clean out the catchall, turn it on and off and pray it would work. Sometimes it would work -- but more often it wouldn't. It was AWFUL! I took it to the curb after 3 months. It's too tempermental and unpredicatable."
2,WON'T LAST,"I loved my EuroPro Shark, for the first few months that it worked. One day, it sucked up the fringe from a rug, and that was that. It now makes a strange noise and doesn't pick up anything anymore.I went out an bought a Eureka cordless vac, which does the job."
3,Not what I expected,"This little sweeper is not as great as what the reviews are saying. If you have pet hair and want to remove it from carpet or rugs, stick with your usual plug in vacuum. It does not work for this. It just scatters hair and stuff. I am returning mine and sticking with my normal ways. Hope this helps. :)"
3,melt down,"I really like my shark sweeper, but, I plugged it in to recharge it and when I went back to use it 5 days later did I ever have a surprise. The battery had got so hot that it melted the plastic housing, it was melted to my brand new carpet. It took me about 30 minutes to get it freed without doing extensive damage to my carpet. I can not find any web site to contact them to see if I can get exchange. I bought it 4 months ago. Please help me."
2,There's better out there!,"I've owned every cordless sweeper that's been made that i know of....This Shark Sweeper AIN'T what it's advertised to be...first off it sounds like a loud whiny kid's toy and feels of equal quality. It picks up ""ok"" but nothing like ""the Boss"" or Black & Decker's cordless older model did. As for it being good at picking up along the sides of floorboards, etc. Blah....nothing impressive. I bought it because i'm in search of the perfect easy vacuum for stairs, well this definitely is NOT it. Spend less - buy the Boss - i've not found one better than it yet....and i've even shelled out [alot of money] for one of those German cordless vacs you see in some catalogs. Now if ORECK would come out with a cordless vac - then we might have something!"
2,Loved my shark for 9 months,I absolutely loved my shark for 9 months. It worked perfectly on hardwood floors for dirt and crumbs. Unfortunetly it is not very durable and it just stopped working after being used daily for 9 months. I was very disappointed because it was such a helpful tool for keeping the kitchen floor clean.
2,Works great...for awhile,"This thing works great. Its not a vacuum, but it picks up everything. However, eventually the front brush stopped spinning and it couldn't be fixed. The inner belt needed to be replaced, and the plastic gears strip out when you ht large items."
1,need web site,Wish I could. The charger did not come in the box. I was not aware of it missing until the refund period expired. I need the website as the one on the sweeper www.sharkvac.com will not open.
1,Poor poor item.,"I was extremly impressed with the shark performance for the first couple of weeks. After about 3 weeks, the shark starts grinding the cheap plastic gears because a little pressure is applied to the nose of the sweeper. The machine now makes a constant grinding noise due to broken teeth on the gears. I was pleased with the wall edge sweeping ""technology"" and also liked the cordless design, but the product is too cheap and has many many flaws. I do not recommened this to anyone. ..."
2,It broke down after a few months!,"This is a great little vaccumn only if it can last. After using it for a few months, it won't charge anymore. I follow all the instruction in the user manuel, but it just died.Now I have to find another little vaccumn to use, hopefully it will last longer than a few months."
2,Not a good buy!,"I bought this 2 months ago and the handle broke off! I cant fix it and though it is still usable, the handle should not have been so poorly made that it breaks when you use it. I dont think this is worth the buy at all. I thought it was going to be great and it was for the first month or so. It expells stuff more than a regular vac and is a pain to clean. This thing is not worth it and I am very disappointed in it. I would not buy this if I were you... What a waste of money and time."
1,Grinding Noise Unacceptable,Read through the 63 reviews here on this product. The grinding noise the sweeper makes when it is dragged backwards is from the roller stopping when it is pulled toward the user rather than pushed. That this grinding noise that results is mentioned in 7 reviews for this product but not at all mentioned in the sweeper's manual is absolutely unacceptable.
1,Great product... until it soon craps out.,"I was very impressed by the info-mercial and after thinking about it for a while I went to Target and bought it.The Shark gradually started making really loud grinding noises, discharging really fast, and becoming less and less effective until, nine months after I bought it, it completely stopped working altogether!I guess, with such a low price-tag, you get what you pay for!"
3,plastic parts break easy,"first to go is ususally the edger spinning brush, then the bottom scrape plate. Not recommended for extended use on uneven rough carpeting. Otherwise a nice easy to use and efficient vacuum."
2,"Delighted at first, Dissapointed 2 months later","I loved my shark when I first got it -- it worked wonderfully. Gradually over the course of the last two months however, it has deteriorated. It makes a horrible clunking sound and doesn't pick up half of what it used to less than two months ago when it was new.By the way, this is my second attempt at the cordless shark sweeper -- the first one did the same thing, and I exchanged it for a new one because I thought it was just a fluke, that maybe I had just gotten a bad one. I think two bad ones in a row is too much of a coincidence. I think the product needs some fine tuning, because it could be great, if it worked longer than two months."
2,Buy the one ON the infomercial!,"Just like I said. Once you get yours and see how pitifully it cleans, call and ask if you can swap yours for the one used on the infomercial..I did.Keep in mind that this is NOT a vacuum. It is a sweeper. There is no vacuum created whatsoever. If it isn't picked up by the rotating brushes, it doesn't get deposited in the exit box.Since I only paid $39 for mine brand new in the box, I'm not too mad about it. It does an adequate job in my all hardwood home. I still have a stick vacuum to do the real work that this one cannot do.If you can get it for under $40, you won't be too unhappy with it. Pay over that and you're getting ripped off. Check out the many available cordless floor vacs that are at or about the same price. They will do a MUCH better job of cleaning the floor for you."
3,customer service,The cordless sweeper is a good product if you don't have a hairy dog who destroys vacuum cleaners......I needed a new brush and ordered 6 weeks ago and back ordered the customer service number is a joke....Noone ever answers or a message saying very busy...........I would not recomend any of euro-pro products because of this.......
2,defected handle,TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.MY HANDLE BROKE OFF AROUND SIX MONTHS AGO.IHAVE ORDERED TWO HANDLES THEY KEEP ON SENDING ME POST CARDS SAYING WE ARE SORRY THEY ARE BACK ORDERDED FOR 3to4WEEKS.I KEEP GETTING POST CARD PERIODICALLY SAYING THE SAME WORDS EVERYONE THAT I KNOW THAT HAS THE SHARK SWEEPER THE HANDLE HAS BROKEN OFF . MY OPINION THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE HANDLE I PERSONALLY THINK THEY SHOULD RECALL THE SWEEPERS AND GIVE THE PEOPLE BACK THERE MONEY ME MY SELF I TREW MY SALES SLIP AWAY BUT IT SHOULDNT MATTER EVERYBODY THAT OWENS A SHARK SWEEPER SHOULD BE RIEMBURSED SALE SLIPS OR NOT.
4,A pretty handy sweeper,"I ordered this sweeper because I have 2 kids and there is always spillage on the carpets.I have a vacuum which I hate to lug up and down the stairs, so I wanted something that was lightweight and portable.Well, I am very happy that I purchased this sweeper. I even like how you can use it on the stairs. The only problem is that it is hard to maneuver on berber carpeting, which is what I have on the first floor of my home. It still picks up the dirt, it's just harder to move along this type of carpet. It works well on high pile carpet as well as hard floors. I also like how it is so easy to empty out the dirt tray when finished.Having no power cord is a wonderful thing when you have a curious 2 year old that wants to pull the plug out of the wall when you're trying to vacuum! All in all, I am very happy with this sweeper."
1,dies too quick,"I loved the machine when I first got it just like most of the reviewer. Sure it seems kind of flimsy, but I figure it wouldn't hurt to use it in my bedroom or to vaccumn small areas here and there. It's definitely not something you'd use on your whole house, so I ended up just using it for my small bedroom. It worked great the first time, and then it started to make very loud rumbling noises after the 3rd time.. eventually~ it just died. I think the belt broke after approx. 10 times of use. The machine was so cool until the 4th or 5th time when it starts to die. I do think that the machine is very flimsy, and I'm kind of sad because I thought it'd at least last a year or so."
2,Loved it at first---very disappointed now,"When I first got my Shark I was thrilled and told everyone I knew about it. I have always let the battery run all the way down to prolong its life but after 6 mos or so, it will only hold its charge about 5 minutes before it starts to fade. Thus, I am very disappointed in it over time."
1,very poor customer service and a cheap sweeper,"After using my Shark sweeper for a few months it died..I bought a new battery for $20.00 plus $5.00 postage. I could not get the battery compartment open to replace the battery. After many phone calls, emails etc. I finally found someone who said to send in the part of the sweeper where the battery is kept. That was the 22nd of February. Today it is May 3rd and I still do not have my sweeper. I also sent in $11.95 to have it repaired. I will never buy a Shark product again. Today they told me they should have an answer for me on Friday. It has taken two and a half months to open a battery compartment.There web site might as well be in Mars as they never answer email."
1,Oh so not worth the money!,I purchased this item thinking it would be good for quick pick ups - easier to use than something with a cord. It doesn't work. A plain old-fashioned carpet sweeper works so much better than this! The battery pack has the life expectancy of about 30 days. Don't waste your money.
2,Not a quality product,"The two best things I can say about this product is it is very light and it does work. But, it is not a quality product. I have had cordless sweepers in the past that have worked better than this. It is also very cheaply made. It doesn't sound like the motor will last very long, it labors and whines. I expect this whole sweeper to give a very limiited amount of service. I would not purchase it again because I know there are better products out there at the same or better price.P.S. It only lasted less than one week, it will not recharge. Back it goes."
1,Defective Product - Bad Warranty,"Beware, this product is poorly built. The plastic handle broke off during normal use, and the company wanted to charge $10 to replace it because it didn't happen within the first 30 days. The other person I know who has one of these things had the same thing happen to them. Customer service was unhelpful."
2,"Started with a Bang, went out with a whimper.","I was so excited and thrilled to have this product. It worked GREAT at first being a huge timesaver over ordinary sweeping with a broom. With the exception of the battery not maintaining a very good charge (I could only sweep one room at a time before it would lose its charge) I was extremely pleased with it.However, after a few months it began making a strange sound and quit picking up anything. It appeared that the brushes were clogged and they wouldn't rotate anymore. My husband took it apart and fixed it but it was only a temporary fix.If I could have a new one every 3 months I would love this product. Otherwise, I wouldn't waste my money on it. I was very disappointed to have to go back to regular broom sweeping."
2,Not great at all!,I would never recommend this vaccuum to anyone. It did not work at all on my tile or hardwood floors. I had to run things over a couple of times before it would pick them up-even little things like a down feather from the couch. Then anything hard would spit out the back. It did not work to get things out of corners. It is very light weight and almost difficult to run. It did okay on the braided rugs - when I pulled it backwards. I gave the 2 stars because it did work alright for the rugs.
4,reat product,I love the Euro Shark. It has lived up to my expectations and would recommend to others.
3,Works...mostly,"It is definitely important to note that this is indeed a sweeper, not a full-out vacuum. I've had it for about three years. My floors are all hardwood and I have some rugs. While overall this machine works pretty well, I still have to sweep corners and under counters because The Shark is too big to maneuver. It also only sucks things up when you go forward. The backward motion does nothing but scatter dust and dirt.It has worked well for my purposes, but after three years of using it once a week the thing is just about shot. It makes funny noises, doesn't always pick stuff up and the side wheel no longer turns.Honestly, it's okay if you find it on sale, but the newer version probably has better improvements. My next sweeper will probably be the G2 not another Shark."
2,Wasn't right for my house,"Ended up giving mine away to a thrift shop didn't hold up to my expectations.Went back to my vacuum cleaner this just didn't do it for me,a lesson in life learned."
1,Batteries cost about $1/week. They are designed to fail quickly.,I used the Shark 4 times over six months and followed all the instructions. After six months the battery went dead. The replacement battery cost (from Amazon) with shipping is $20.49 + 5.49 shipping = $25.98.Buy two batteries a year = $51.96.Would not buy any Shark product.
2,Shark Euro- Pro sweeper difficult to put together,"I had difficulty putting the handles together, then found the handle did not bend easily when pressing the handle release. I really had to force this and was afraid I might break it Have used this sweeper only once and it recommends emptying after each use. The one touch empty button did not work so I had to snake the dust out of the container by hand. I had hoped I could use this for quick clean up but I spent more time trying to get it to work properly. I would not recommend it, guess I will stay with my Dirt Devil"
3,Eh,"This worked well for the first several months on my bare floors and short-pile carpets. Wasn't great suction, but got the job done. Fully charged runs for quite a while. Collection area empties easily. However, after a few months the suction seemed to lessen, and then one day I went to vacuum with it and there was noise but no suction and no brush movement. Fiddled with it a bit with no luck. It was ok for the time it worked, but I finally went out and bought myself a Dyson. Worth what I spent on it, which was about $35."
1,It won't last long...,"The first few weeks it worked fine. Now it is much noisier and makes a bad grinding sound when moved back and forth. It has started to make more noise since I last reviewed it, and I don't think it will last much longer.Euro-Pro (the manufacturer)never answers the phone listed in the manual. Their line is always busy."
5,Good machine for,"Bought this machine for ceramic tile floors and hardwood floors. It does a very good job picking up dust and small pieces of dirt. On the infomercial, it shows the unit picking up nails, coins, etc. Who needs that?? I hate sweeping the floor since you push dirt all over the place, and I didn't like the idea of paying for consumable products like Swifter, so I tried the Shark. Run time is very long. And, it does do the job. Because the unit works on a rolling brush head, and not suction, I don't think I'd recommend the machine for carpet, despite the claim of the infomercial. I won't have enough power to get down into deep fibers - so stick with a corded vacuum for that applications. But, for flat floors, it's great. The unit assembles in 2 minutes and mine even came charged so I could test it out right away."
5,Better than ever expected!,"This machine just arrived yesterday. I charged the battery and when I came home from work today I was able to glide through all my rooms-kitchen (vinyl), bathroom (tile), and the rest (hardwood) in a matter of minutes as if on air. When I finished, it had taken up all the dust and clips, etc. and without any effort on my part. What a godsend! Who wants to buy a heavy vacuum cleaner?"
1,One of my worst purchases ever,I actually threw this product out. It didn't pick up anything. Not even dirt. I purchased another Eureka Quik up cordless vacuum to replace this sweeper with much better results. Please save your money.
2,Battery does not hold up,great suction for about a year. Great accessories but after about a year the battery starts to go.
1,"Great for 3 months, then battery dies","We bought one for our coffeehouse. It was phenomenal the first couple of months. We were lauding its performance to customers who asked about it. Then we noticed that a full recharge wasn't lasting very long. 30 minutes, then 20, then 10, then 5, then within six months, a charge would last but a few seconds. We found out we weren't the only ones with this problem. The company wasn't helpful. Acquiring replacement batteries are as/more expensive than a new unit.If they fixed the battery problem we'd give it a 5 since it was great for what it did and what it cost. But since you can't run it without the battery, we can't recommend it."
3,"Until It Hits a Snag, It's Great","First, I want to say I was impressed by the convenience and efficiency of the sweeper. It does have a tendency to become externally dusty itself as it works, since I suppose the brushroller builds up a static charge. However, the problem I have with it is that I used it actually less than ONE HOUR before it encountered something it couldn't immediately 'whip' into its dustcup, and then the drive belt stripped and then snapped. Try to find a replacement belt, folks. Go ahead -- just try!So, be careful, but aside from that, a pretty nice little convenience."
1,Worthless junk,I have had TWO of these things and they were both worthless! The first one just quit after a few months (the little side brush had stopped working almost immediately. The second one had a battery meltdown in about 7 months. The little side brush also quit working almost immediately. Both of them made horrible noises and were dirty and messy to clean up. I did not overuse these things; they are just junk! Ugg!
1,"I was exceedingly-no, profoundly-disappointed","If you want a carpet sweeper (and they are great when you want one) buy a Casabella non-electric sweeper (or another brand such as Bissell). I have one that cost me $19, and it does what a carpet sweeper is supposed to: pick up the little stuff on the surface quickly, quietly. It's the one I use all the time.This Shark cordless sweeper did not work well at all, required multiple passes on my hard flooring and my tight berber carpeting. Then soon after the warranty period was over, it picked up & caught a long thread, which made the sweeper brush stop. (The thread wasn't even attached to anything else!) I got it out OK, but ever since it makes a really strange sound, and barely works at all. So it sits in my closet.This Shark cordless sweeper was NOT worth my money at all.An alternative is a good stick vac, especially if you've got those small spaces with both hard floors that need frequent light cleanups."
1,Unwarranted junk,"Bought this thing in Dec. 2003 .I have used it probably 12 times in the year that I have had it. It seemed to do what the manufacturer claimed. Today I plugged in the charger and smelled hot plastic, and the moter was frozen. When I tried to access warranty information on the Shark website I could not find anything except that the warranty is for one year. No way to get warranty service or anything like it. This company is fly by night."
2,This is not a well built item!,"After seeing the commercial on tv and then talking to my sister who had just purchased one, I ordered one for myself. It did everything it said it could do and more for the first month and then it started making a grinding noise and the handle broke off. Eventually I had to throw it away. I was so frustrated with it because in theory it was a wonderful product, but it was not built well enough to hold together for very long. I really wish that they would re-design it to be of better quality. I have 6 children who love to drag food all over the house and leave crumbs in their path, while it worked, this sweeper was wonderful for keeping all the debris under control."
2,Doesn't hold up,Although the shark cordless sweeper is a handy tool that serves well for picking up small debris from the floor it is poorly made. The parts are also impossible to get. We broke a belt on ours and I am still trying to find a replacement.
2,Would not recommend,"My initial review was 5 star, but after owning this for 3 months I would caution anyone from buying it. The power dropped off dramatically after maybe 5 usages. Now, when I try to recharge I have to wiggle and fool with the recharger to get a connection. The unit is starting to squeak - ominously. I've used it a total of maybe 12 times - very light usage and followed all the instructions. I tried to reach service - forget it - busy signal 12 hours straight. On their Web site it states that if you return the unit for repairs you have to ship it yourself and enclose $12 for return shipping. Hopefully it lasts at least a year - because it suits my needs. But if you want to buy one - buy it at a local store where you can easily return it - and keep the box; you will likely need it."
3,Shark lacks bite,"I bought this Cordless Sweeper for quick cleanups. It worked great for about a week and then started to deteriorate. (making strange noises and not picking up dirt as well) If you buy this, do not buy it to use as an everyday tool."
1,This Shark Bites...the dust!,"The Ultra Shark seemed like a really neat item. It vacuumed the baseboards on the walls, and picked up dust and hair, which were not visible to the eye. After about two weeks of use, the engine/motor would make grinding noises. A week later, it just stopped. It was charged, then re-charged, but still didn't work. It made a humming noise, and that's all. We cleaned it, re-inserted batteries, we did everything! It just doesn't work. ..."
2,O.K. for disposable,"I started out loving this for quick pick ups.The fact that it's cordless was great for mobility. Once I got my daughter to use it as a sweeper and not a vacuum she loved using it for her room. However........ the handle broke off after about 6 months. Now it doesn't work at all. Not sure what happened, it just won't start. It was nice while it lasted but I wouldn't buy another one. I ended up buying a corded stick vac that is just as light weight."
1,Worst Vacuum Ever,This thing broke after just 2 days. My friend also bought one and his broke after 4 days.Very shoddy and poorly made. How does the company get away with making such a poor quality product.Avoid this product.
4,Great for Apartments!,"This SWEEPER is great for apartments. Before guests come over, the shark sweeper gets pulled out and it is a quick clean up for any dirt on the carpet or kitchen floor. It is not great for in depth cleaning, it's not suppose to be. Cleans small spaces and the kitchen floor wonderfully! It stays charged for 2 hours, which is long enough to do several quick cleanings. Great product, we love it."
5,Great Sweeper,I haved purchased this Shark cordless sweeper. After I got the Sweeper I charged it over 2 days. Then when I came back work I used the Shark and it was great. I vacummed my carpet over 2 times with my hoover and then when I used it over my carpet with the shark it was amazing! I never knew that there was so much of the dirt in that canister. I vacummed all over my house and I got alot of dust and dirt. I never had this sweeper that would do this great job. I also tried it on my floors and it also worked by sucking a alot of dirt up. It was just so powerful.
1,good while it lasted,"Super nice concept, but after a week, I noticed it keep charged up.The bottom scrape plate should of been made out of riveted metal.The plastic snagged too much and finally broke off. Still usable, but still snags. I might have to apply some thick tape on the bottom."
1,Poor sweeper,"After about 3 weeks, the shark starts grinding the cheap plastic gears because a little pressure is applied to the nose of the sweeper. The machine now makes a constant grinding noise due to broken teeth on the gears. I was pleased with the wall edge sweeping ""technology"" and also liked the cordless design, but the product is too cheap and has many many flaws. I do not recommened this to anyone. Please avoid at all costs. It will ""sweep"" your money away."
2,"Good, but.........","If you have small area rugs (i.e., by the kitchen sink), this sweeper will suck them right up! I have several of these rugs, so I would have to pick them up and shake them outside to clean. A nuisance when you need to vac every day. Also, it did not clean crumbs, etc., out of the grout grooves of my tile floors. It sweeps flats surfaces just fine."
1,Not recommended,"Used 2 - 3 times a week in home. Side brush failed to rotate after 1 month. Main brush failed after 3 months. Opened up to find side brush drive to be a plastic gear, stripped. Main brush driven by belt that had stretched so not to function. Warranty cost shipping both ways plus $11 fixed repair cost.Not worth repairing after 3 months light use. Free to good home. you pay shipping."
1,Take this off the market!,"I keep seeing this sweeper advertised everywhere. I bought it, and it worked fine... for three weeks. Then it became extremely noisy, and then useless. I had to discard it. What a waste of money! The ""Customer Service"" department doesn't answer their phone...ever!"
1,horrible!,"I recently got this product on the HSN, and it is truly something I regret!!!PROS:CONS:- doesn't glide, as show on tv!- QUIET?!?! I think NOT!!!- shoots out most of the stuff picked up-hard to contorolWhy do the people on tv lie? BECAUSE MONEY!50.00?NOOO WAY!!Plus people dont get what they pay for!Take my advise and shove this thing in the garbage can and by a diffrent vacume that u pay good money for!"
3,Dog Hair: Wonderful! - Bird Seed: NO WAY!!!!!,"My sister bought one because she has a Golden Retriever and needed something lightweight to help pick up all of the dog hair, and it DOES work well for her.But, just a word of caution....This will NOT pick up bird seed. It just spits it out all over the place, making an even bigger mess."
4,Love the Shark,"My only question is where do I get replacement parts, for instance the brush and anything else that might need replaced. No parts list with a price came with the item."
4,Has Been Worth My Money,"After reading so many negative reviews, had to give my opinion.I have had my Shark for a YEAR now and I STILL love it. I had to contact the company once after a couple of months. The rubber strip on the bottom of the sweeper came off and wouldn't stay on. I email Euro-Pro and they mailed a new strip right to me. No cost! I charge it about once every 2 weeks and use it several times a week in my kitchen and bath. I have 2 kids and a landscaper husband, I have DIRT!! Mine has not been overly loud, the kids LIKE to use it, I use it occasionally on the carpet for quick pick ups and it performs well. I would buy another if this one quit, I am buying one for my sister's new home with ALL hardwood. I told her she can't go without.It sounds like Euro-Pro needs to fine tune their manufacturing problems and maybe use better materials to eliminate the problems others are having."
1,Worthless,"I purchased the ""Shark"" from HSN a couple of weeks ago. I can't wait to send it back. I worked fine the first time I used it...the second time a rubber strip on the bottom came off and I can't get it back on so now it ""scrapes"" across carpet. Also, the ""maneuverable"" handle has stopped ""maneuvering"" so I can't sweep under anything because it rears up on its back wheels and spins in the air! Thank goodnes I kept the box it came in because it is going back TODAY. Don't believe what you see on TV...and don't waste your money."
1,Bad quality!,"This could be great product to use on bare floor, but has very low build quality. I charged it for 16 hour before the first use. In the first 5 minutes, it work great, light weight, pick up everything. But stop working after that, and make crazy loud noise, returned it to store. If you lucky, you may get a good one, that why you can see some positive reviews here. But even you got a good one, I doubt it will last long."
4,"Expect a sweeper, not a vaccum","I love my shark and I've owned it for a while now. It's light weight and the edge sweeper helps me get things out of nasty corners. I mostly use it on bare floors, so I'm not running into some of the issues that the other people have are because I'm not trying to use it as a vacuum. I love the head swivel feature. It makes it easy to get around chair legs and obsticles. It's easy to empty and easy to dehair (a big problem in my house.) It does clean the top layer off carpets, but it definately has a hard time doing it. (The motor sounds different.)If you are looking for a good electric broom. This is what you want. If you're looking for a vacuum, this is not what you want."
3,My Shark Takes A Bite Out Of Dirt!!!!,"When I first saw the Advertisement on TV for the Cordless Shark Vac - I thought, ""Does it really work as well as they say?"" So, I decided to buy it and see for myself. WOW!!! It picks up everything in it's path - From Pet Hair to Food Particles - I was Amazed!! The only downfall to this machine is that you have to clean out the brush after every use, but it is definitely worth it - I haven't seen my floors this clean in a long time.Thanks, Shark Vac!!"
3,Slightly above average sweeper,"Not a bad unit. Works well on hardwood and linoleum -- works fair on carpets. The little side brush came off after just a couple of uses, but the manufacturer was good about sending a replacement."
4,Absolutely Love It!!!,"What a great little sweeper! This one really picks up the pet fur and litter on my carpets. I should know; I have 5 furry animals. It isn't that great on my tile, but it's performance on carpets sells it in my book. No more dragging out the big vacuum every day to avoid fur bunnies! And I can pick this sweeper up and carry it with just one hand. The dust bin is easy to empty and there are no bags to replace. The charge on this little sweeper lasts twice as long as other sweepers I have purchased, so that's a big plus. I have purchased four different vacuums trying to find one that isn't too hard to use but still picks up the fur on the carpet, and this one does the best job hands down!! I HIGHLY recommend this GREAT little sweeper!!"
2,A little disappointed,"The vacuum does not do well on carpet as stated, and while it may suck on forward motion it seems to release on backward motion. It does suck up pet hair as stated but spits it back out when I pull back, and I don't know about you but I can't vacuum only in a forward motion. It does well with larger items like bolts etc., but that seems to be all it is good for. I saved the shark box but not the shipping box, as soon as I find one I will be returning this item."
1,"waste of my money, waste of my time","I'm changing my review. At first I thought the shark was average. Now I know I could personally lie on the floor and inhale deeply and I would pick up more stuff. All this thing does is pick up some dog hair and then spit most of it back out in big chunks. It is ""ok"" at picking up larger things, but if something is that big on the floor, just bend over and pick it up yourself. I wanted something that would really work well on my hardwood floors, especially on the dog hair. The people that post that it picks up pet hair must not be able to see well. I think most of them must be blind. Don't waste your money. The only good thing about this is that's it's lightweight and cordless. But I can say that about a lot of things....."
1,Worthless,"I have been through at least 10 small sweepers before finally keeping this Shark.REVISIONS:I:After several months, I demote the rating of this product from 5 to 3 stars. After a while, the gears do whine at certain angles, and the efficiency of pickup deteriorates. I only use this one or twice a week, and any heavier use would compromise the flimsy design.I no longer can recommend it seriously.IISecond Revision (1/04): Now the battery does not hold a charge.This is a very bad product."
1,"I HATE IT!!!!!! STARS ""0000000""","I HAVE 2 DOGS AND SOME PARROTS , SO BETWEEN THE FUR AND THE SEEDS I HAVE PROBLEMS .I VACUUM A FEW TIMES A DAY WITH THE DYSON VACUUM, WHICH IS AMAZING , BUT I NEEDED SOMETHING QUICK AND EASY . FIRST THE HANDLE KEPT FALLING APART ON THE SHARK AND IT STARTED SHOOTING STUFF OUT THAT IT ACTUALLY HURT. THE VACUUM PIECE HAS A WOBBLEY MIND OF ITS OWN , AND IT JUST BLOWS THE FUR ACROSS THE FLOOR . I TRIED IT ON RUGS AND IT TOOK MUCH EFFORT TO GET IT ACROSS A SMALL AREA, AND WHEN IT WENT SMOOTHLY IT WASN'T PICKING ANYTHING UP. I DIDNT EXPECT IT TO DEEP CLEAN , BUT THIS GIVES ME MORE WORK LEAVING LITTLE PILES OF POLYESTER FROM THE RUG ON THE FLOOR . I AGREE WITH THE NOISE , IT FREAKS MY BIRDS OUT TOO. I WISH I CAN GET A REFUND .. BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME .. TO LATE NOW .. BUT NEVER AGAIN"
2,"Good idea, poor quality","Having two young children and not much time, I bought this sweeper to do quickie clean ups on both my carpet and hardwood floor. At first it seemed to work great. The sweeper is light and easy to use. But after less than a month of usage, the handle broke off (this also happened to a friend of mine a few weeks later!). And in order to get this fixed through the warranty, I would have had to pay all shipping costs (for a total of approx. ... -- the product costs ...). It was a lot cheaper to tape the handle back on. It's been 3 months since I bought the sweeper and the motor is starting to make strange, clunking sounds. Maybe the sweeper works well for people with very, very light clean ups. But if you're like me and have dirt, hair, and crumbs that need picking up everyday, I wouldn't waste my money on this product!"
1,If you had a 0 star I would give the shark a zero,"I have been trying for days to get through to their phone line ; they tell me to go to their web site. I have done that and they never answer emails. I sent part of my sweeper to them to be repaired three months ago and now have a handle and that is it. What a lousy company and a rotten customer service. Where does the buck stop????? I am sure I will never get my sweeper back or any compensation , but at least I can vent my anger here."
1,Don't buy the hype!,"I fell in love with this from the infomercial. I bought one at Target after reading poor customer service reviews for the Shark website. So...I'm glad I did. I returned mine 3 days later. The sweeper runs/works for about 15 minutes, then the charge dies. It didn't pick up pet food or litter spills (lightweight and very small stuff- and the reason I bought it in the 1st place). This sweeper is LOUD!!! Poorly made and it shows. I wanted this to keep the floors swept in-between cleanings...it failed. Don't buy this!!!!!"
3,GREAT SWEEPER BUT DON'T BREAK A BELT!!,"I loved the sweeper! It was great for sweeping in between thedeep vacuuming. It's brush picks up but it doesn't have any suction so you do have to use a vacuum to get a really deepcleaning.But be very careful not to snag anything on then brush. After about two weeks, I caught the fringe on an area rug in the brush and broke the belt. I had purchased the sweeper at Sears, however they don't sell replacement belts for the Shark. NOBODY DOES!! The only place I could find to buy them was the: sharksweeper.netwebsite, but after placing three consecutive orders and waiting three and one half weeks with no results, I gave up and returned the sweeper.Thank goodness Sears was so understanding about the return. I phoned the orders in all three times and was greeted with a lot of uninterested and rather rude order takers. The sweeper was great but without a belt it's worthless!"
1,Very Short Life Span,"I thought that the Shark was great when I first got it. I am now on my second one the first having only lasted about three weeks. This one, my second, lasted a very short time also. Both of these sweepers started making a loud noise when I tried to use it. This is made very cheaply and will not last. I DO NOT recommend anyone waste their money on it."
1,Shark Does Not Work with Dog Hair - Beware,"I ordered the shark to do small pet hair pickups between my regular weekly vaccuming. In less than a month of using the shark twice a week in a small apartment, the product has already worn itself out.If you have pets, don't bother."
1,Defective battery/charger?,"We are about to trash our Euro-Pro UV610 cordless sweeper unless someone can tell me an alternative. It refused to charge so it got tossed into a corner and forgotten. When""resurrected"" it charged slightly but never had enough power to do anything."
2,Must have received lemon,Purchased for small clean up under kitchen table and benches but mine makes noise and just usually pushes the items around- does not pick them up. My kitchen is brand new hardwood flooring and so I was very disappointed with the product. And their customer service was absolutely no help so it sits in my basement not being used at all.
4,Can't do without it!,"Toddler triplets leave crumbs and crackers everywhere. The Shark picks it all up from hard floors and carpets. It is light, manueverable, and the charge lasts through lots of clean-ups, especially since it is so quick and easy to use. If you have creatures in your life that leave little messes, the Shark is for you.I suppose that it could be more solid, that is why just 4 stars, but for the money, it is definitely worth it."
1,Shoddy Construction. 2 Units failed,"The two units that I purchased failed after a couple months of light use. When they fail, they start making horrible screeching or clashing gear sounds. My impression is that this unit is made of the cheapest materials possible. After returning the second failed unit I purchased a Dirt Devil M083414 Bagless Stick Vacuum that appears to work much better and costs only slightly more."
5,Sigh.. oh how I love this product,"I am an at home mom of two young boys (5 & 2) and not a day goes by when I do not use this sweeper. It works on floor and rug, on wet (noodles, etc) and dry spill, and it doesnt make a lot of noise so it doesnt frighten my younger son. In addition, it is so easy and almost fun to use, that my older boy offerse to help with it when there is a mess (and there is ALWAYS a mess) to clean.I dont have to haul out my vacuum each time things need to be given a quick clean. And this easily tucks out of the way as it recharges.Buy and enjoy the ease."
1,Awful Product,"Wish I could have given it 0 or negative stars. Bought it (from HSN), used it for about a week & the roller stopped turning. Dust & fibers collected all around the gears. Opened it up (not an easy job), cleaned the dust from around the inner workings & had the same thing happen a couple of days later. This is a flimsy piece of garbage, don't waste your money...get the Eureka 570B. I purchased the Eureka 570B (from Amazon) and what a difference-a lot better constructed, picks dirt up better and doesn't break down after a few uses. The only advantage the Euro-Pro has over the Eureka is that it is lighter-about 4 pounds vs 8 pounds-GET THE EUREKA & PASS ON THE EURO_PRO."
4,"It's a good machine, but pray you never have to contact EuroPro","As it's already been pointed out the use of plastic gears is its Achilles heal. The one attached to the beater bar wears out as quickly as you can fill the dust bin.But I digress contacting the manufacture, be prepared to take a trip to Hell and back since that's where the CnoSR people are. And if you ever speak to the self-proclaimed supervisor you best have your asbestos undies on.I bought this thing for my mother and she uses it daily, she loves it. I hate it for no other reason than having to deal with a bunch of worthless idiots that know less about the machines than anyone. I had to order some parts and almost had to reach threw the receiver to slap some sense into the moron taking the order, they'll order the more expensive part and leave it up to the next CnoSR to deal with the mess they created."
2,Not Happy,"I have a small 1000 ft. house thought vacuum would be great since I only have wood & tile floors, wrong! The canister randomly falls off while vacuuming and the battery will not stay charged long enough to vacuum my house. I have other Shark products that I love but this one is no good. Save your money."
1,A Good Effort,I felt the book had potenetial but somewhere in the middle it started to get muddled.The overall premise is good and the characters were interesting but something was lost in the translation.I think maybe too much was going on with the main character.The plot was somewhat esoteric.The ending was a bit disappointing.Like I said it had potential but it needed some tweaking.
3,a slow read with a tad of humour,I just completed the wives of short creek and found the book funny until the end. The author seems to be on a personal vandetta against the Mormon Church.Is this book fiction? I would say that the author is trying to push his anti mormon agenda. He would be a better writer if he got over his bitterness and focused on writing about non mormon issues
3,Typos on every page,"I was really looking forward to reading this book since I enjoyed Grimmett's ""The Ferry Woman"" so much. This one was OK - a somewhat comical (and fictional) look at the polygamist community Short Creek. Not sure that anyone unfamiliar with Mormon history or the various scandals of the church's past would think it quite as amusing as I did. The worst part of the book was the absolute horrendous editing. There were blatant typos on almost every page and that is not an exaggeration. It was hard to get into reading it because I'd get so distracted by all of the errors - there were entire words missing and it would take me a few moments to try to figure out what he was trying to say. I can't imagine why no one caught those major mistakes. That tainted my opinion of the story."
2,light reading for the light headed,"I found this book at the D.I. so I thought for 50 cents I would give it a try. The book is easy reading, though trite, I found the characters to be flawed and I must admit that the book is fiction. 100 per cent unadulterated fiction.The author seems to have taken the anti Mormon rewrite of history and use it to suit his fairy tale of Mormon history.I am not sutrprised that the Mormon is an ex Mormon. Some of the most absurd have been written by alleged writers who did not for some reason or another choose to just let go.I originally gave this book one star but will upgrade to ""2"" stars. One for spelling and one for at least getting the names right."
5,"Great read, Comical, insightful, historically researched.","Mr. Grimmett's second novel is immensely entertaining, witty and brings to life a polygamist culture still alive and well on the Utah/Arizona border There are few novels that make me laugh out loud. Fewer still that want me to turn the page. This fills the bill on both counts. Although a work of fiction, it falls squarely in reality. Grimmett's insight into mormonism and the polygamist cult is hugely insightful and brings a unique perspective rarely achieved. It's long overdue and a tribute to Grimmett that he's tackled such a notorius subject that's pushed in the shadows of Utah like a decaying carcass.I do not hesitate a second in recommending this novel to anyone interested in Utah history because it is living, breathing history -- now."
1,No Replacement Battery,"I purchased the DV-4200i from Amazon as soon as it was available. It is a fine product. There are 2 major exceptions however.1. You can not buy a replacement battery. I have been in contact with Pretec with no success. I have searched the internet and local stores. No one sells this battery. I suggest that amazon stop selling this product until batteries are available.2. I had to buy my own software to combine clips taken with the camera. The company did not know where I could buy the program nor did they suggest a product name. I did the research and found that ACE is a fine program to combine the clips. I passed this info on to the company.It is a shame that such a fine product should have such major shortcomings. I wonder if their purchasing Dept. gets the batteries from. The won't tell me.The battery is a rechargeable Li-ion 7.4 700mAh. It is proprietary battery.if anyone who is reading this knows where I may buy the batteries, please email me atwhollander@yahoo.com"
3,Slightly different,"I read this book because it concerned forest fire fighters and is very much in vogue, considering the fires in the western states this summer. It also purports to be a crime mystery. Well, the first 40% of the book concerned a great deal of data describing the characters and the setup of a forest fighting unit. The heroine is one of those ""up against the glass ceiling"" characters, in both money and position. I was ready to put the book aside because of the lack of crime until it happened. It wasn't one but five deaths. The plot then picked up as the investigators (heroine, cop, and the forest service investigative team) all tried to solve the mystery forensically. Then it got really interesting. And, the ending was NOT the usual hackneyed ending I have come to find in so many recent novels. As a matter of fact, I thought the ending was surprising.So, if you like characters and fighting underdogs, as well as forensic crime-solving, I recommend this book."
3,The first boring fire in history!,"If you thought Andreae's Lee Squires series was poorly written and characterized, wait until you read this one!"
5,Lost in 1939,"Amidst the turbulent sea of box office smashes on 1939 like Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz, not to mention the start of WWII, this black and white masterpiece seemed to have past beneath the waves into obscurity. It is such a classic that the acting remains believable even today, 65 years later. Don't believe me? Just try to sit through with dry eyes, the scene wherein all in the bunkhouse awaits the 'end' of poor ol Candy's dog who is put to sleep by the gun of a cagey ranch hand. Alot of films this old lose their believibilty and lustre, as acting techniques and directing gets more sophisticated, however Burgess Merideth and Lon Chaney Jr prove two hard acts to follow. This VHS perhaps is one of the best in my library."
5,Great Film Adaptation Of A Great Novel,"Of all the television and theatrical releases that have followed, none have reached the perfect cast of this 1939 classic. Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney Jr. in their finest roles. Where were the Academy Award nominations for these two outstanding performances? Lon Chaney Jr's final scene was worth more than what's his name's entire bore in ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"". ZZZZZZZZZ! Portrayals just as imagined from Steinbeck's novel."
5,Bleak Classic,"It is a shame that this classic film of the famed Steinbeck novel has had to wait the industry's marketing of two vastly inferior remakes before being made available on VHS. Lon Chaney Jr.'s portrayal of the retarded Lennie (""Which way did he go, George?) is definitive. The bleak black and white cinematography perfectly capture the atmosphere of the depression era countryside. The scenes depicting Lennie's death and dispatch of Candy's dog are unbearably heartbreaking. This movie has the power to engage you straight through from the opening scene."
3,An Uncomfortable Feeling,"At the time of this writing I see that most everyone has rated this with 5 stars, but I do not agree. When this version once again became available I was so excited to see it. I absolutely love this story and I love old movies, but for me this was just an OK film and the weak link is Lon Chaney. I know I'm going to take a hit for this from fans of Mr. Chaney, but he does a caricature of the dim-witted Lenny, without depth, portraying Lenny in an unflattering, stereotypical way that is degrading to mentally challenged individuals. Obviously I do not feel that this was deliberate, but if I had seen this performance is a school yard, I would have thought it was a bully making fun of a special needs child.Now if you have seen the John Malkovich version, THERE is an actor who knows how to play Lenny with depth, compassion and truth. When watching this version I believe that Mr. Malkovich is mentally challenged. While watching the Chaney version, I just felt uncomfortable."
4,Christmas Gift for my Dad,"I bought this DVD for my dad as it was on his wish list. He was very happy to receive it, due to delayed shipping time around the holidays we did not receive it till about 2-3 weeks after Christmas. I was not happy about that."
2,10 pages of profound beauty,The preface to this book is both profound and beautiful. The remainder of the book is a boring list of words that I found useless. I have to admit that the first 10 pages provided value that exceeds the price of the book. If you are western writer this book may hold some value.
5,Let's people know you want to keep your stuff secure.,"This is a hefty lock. Aside from cutting the shackle somehow (the shroud is hardened), I don't think the everyday thief will get through this. As far as bump reistance, I don't know.For ~$20, this is a great buy. Plus, the color screams don't F with me!!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased this with great excitement, I had just gotten my braces and planned to keep them clean. I thought I could use it at school since I have a sink. It didn't work at all. I used it one time and the water ran down my arm, I couldn't get any real pressure and the second time I tried to use it, it wouldn't even turn on.I gave it a third chance by charging it one whole day. No dice. The thing just wasn't worth it. I called the company and had a horrid experience there also. The number wasn't 24 hours. I left a message and no one would call me back. I sent an email and no one answered it.Amazon did give me most of my money back but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth in all senses of the phrase."
1,Not Recommended,This item was purchased for my daughter in order to assist her with cleaning her newly aquired braces and spreader. It broke within 2 weeks. I am highly disappointed and would not recommend this prodeuct.
2,Died after the first week of use,"After the initial charge of 16 hours, I was able to use the water jet (somewhat akward getting to back teeth) & was pleased. After several days of use, the power began to fade, so I decided to recharge for another 16 hours (inconvenient amount of charge time). The next day, I filled the reservoir & was ready to use -- I clicked the button & NOTHIN' !! I thought MAYBE I didn't have it plugged in correctly, so I tried charging for another 16 hours. Next day I clicked the button & absolutely NOTHIN'.Since I purchased this item from Target & still have the receipt, I plan to return. I hope they will refund my $$."
1,Don't even consider it!,"Worked great about 10 times then quit dead. Found problem in charging connector, tab switch would hang up in the ""charge"" position. Got this loosened and it worked again for about four more times. Finally the pressure dropped so low as to be useless and the battery would not hold a charge. Solved problem by tossing it in the trash!"
4,Excellent product !,I must say that I have to agree with all the positive reviews. I have been using it for over an year now.This product gets the job done at the right price.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the charger is rated only for 110V as opposed to be 240V-110V so when you travel you need to bring an extra adapter to convert from 240V to 110V.Otherwise awesome product.
1,Returned,"It would be a nice tool, if it would work more than a few days.They should specify on the packaging ""DISPOSABLE WATER JET""."
2,Rechargeable Water Jet,"I consider this item as a disposable one. I have bought 6 over the past 3 years. The battery becomes dead in about 6 months of recharging. The manufacturer does not supply spare batteries and, hence, I have to throw the whole item away and buy a new one. Also, it doesn't work every time and you have to play certain tricks to get the air out of the system. The only advantage of this product is that it's cordless."
1,Very Poor Product,Cumbersome and the jet action stopped working after two months after reharging I strongly advice against this product A total waste of money
2,Lasted 5 months,Did its job while it worked for 5 months. I bought mine in a pharmacy. The reservoir is a bit small without refilling so you have to rush a little to get to all the crevices. The pressure was fine until it slowed to a weak stream of water about 6 months after. I thought it was plugged and tried letting it sit overnight with white vinegar twice but to no avail. Turning it off then on seems to coax it to work for a few seconds but it's still headed for the wastebasket.
3,"Some good, some bad","I've used the Compact Water Jet for a couple of weeks now. I like the fact that it's small,affordable, and only holds enough liquid for one use at a time. However, the on/off switch is awkward, and it's impossible to hold in a position that will keep the suction tube in the liquid and not be terribly messy. I also would have liked the option of a finer tip. All in all, if you can afford to buy the larger version with a stationary tank and a wand, do so, but if you need portability and the lower price, this one will work."
2,Interplak rechargeable water jet,"I was not very happy with this product. It's not very powerful & didn't do a very good job. So I then ordered the Interplak Dental Water Jet, model WJ6RW & really love it. I had one like this for a number of year until it stopped working (after dropping it a few times!). It's much more powerful & really gets the job done. I'm very happy with the newer one."
1,A DISAPPOINTMENT OF NIGHTMARISH PROPORTIONS,"All I can say is if you're a fan of Nightware on Wax and their/his previous releases (Carboot Soul, Smoker's Delight), do NOT get this album. You will be completely disappointed. At least K&D did something fresh and unique on their DJ Kick compilation. The music on here drags. Nothing makes you want to move at all. The songs DJ Ease selects are mediocre and almost soul-less. I wanna get rid of my album. Anybody interested? Do yourself a favor and stay with Carboot Soul and Smoker's Delight and Cafe Del Mar for a truly enlightening N.O.W. experience."
2,"Not bad, not great","The ""DJ Kicks"" compilation series has had some realy, really great CDs come out of it, most notably the mixes by Giles Peterson and Kemistry & Storm. They've been stylistically very unique and wide, with really good songs strung together regardless of the style. This one by N.O.W. isn't one of the best ones, but it's not bad. It's a great hip-hop disc minus the rapping, so if you're looking for hip-hop mood music sans vocals (for the MOST part), this is it. I thought it might be a little more moody - more in the vein of say, early DJ Cam - but it's beats are very traditional hip-hop.The soundtrack for bombing subway cars and school buildings with spray paint, but not as underground in parts as you may like if you're a hip-hop head."
2,Poor sizing,"I really liked this item and was excited about the quality and price and prompt shipment. However, ""one size"" includes people only 5'7'' and shorter. im 5'10'' and even though the packaging says it fits anyone from 5'0'' to 5'10''', they don't. even get past mid thigh. too bad."
3,"hot design, not so hot fit","These pantyhose were so nice but the material was a bit cheap, it barely stretched and me being 5'8 tall they barely fit. Being one size it should be able to stretch."
1,Bad!!! Do not buy,"i did not like this becuase, first, when you try to shoot the ball, it breaks the net. ( it keeps folding it down). I got bored of it because the ball is heavy and somtimes, teh whole thig falls off your door. Even thought it lights up adn looks cool, trust me, i wouldnt buy this."
2,blah blah,"I don't like this hoop very much because the ball is too heavy. Due to the weight of the ball when throwing it, the rim will usuallly snap down just about every time. I got it for my office but with the ball being more bulky than a regular nerf ball it is very loud when it hits the backboard or your door. So instead of buying a new nerf set, I just bought a soft foam ball, so I can actually make a shot and the whole office won't know I'm shooting hoops behind closed doors."
1,Oh Nooooo.........,"Wow. This toy makes you wonder if anyone at Nerf actually tests these things before they put them to market. As has been said, my first impression was ""where is the nerf ball? This thing feels like a brick!"". I assumed that I was being overly picky because of my kids' newly renovated room, so I hung it over the back of the door like it said, and took a shot. It was so loud that it scared me - plus I thought for a minute that the ball had actually broken the (solid oak) door. Bottom line - this thing is junk. I had to bolt it to the wall to even use it, and even then it stinks. The walls rattle with every shot, and you have to swish it to make a basket with the brick of a ball. Stay away from this one...."
4,nerf nite jam nerfoop is great,This toy is awesome.If you think the ball sucks then get a different ball that is lighter that is what I did.Sure it doesn't light up but what the heck
2,ball to heavy,The ball is to heavy for the net. Because of the lighting in the ball it is heavy and constantly pulls down the net. I went and bought a diffrent ball to go with it.
3,ball is to heavy for the hoop,the ball is very durable it took me 2 days from kicking it and hitting it with a baseball bat to break but its to heavy the hoop can handle it but any thing else in the room cant
4,Awesome in the dark!!!,"I was having a sleepover one night, and before the guys came over, I decided to go out to the store and get something cool. I saw this and just had to get it. We must have played with it for 4 hours straight that night. True the ball is too heavy, but so what, it lights up. My friends and I play with this every time they come over. You won't regret getting this if you wanna have fun with friends or just by yourself. Awesome toy."
1,Poor conception on OK idea,"This is a rambling elaboration on the classic original Nerf hoop and ball set. The rim lights demand three AAA batteries, the ball two. A phillips head screwdriver is needed for battery installation and getting them into the ball will give fans of the special edition of Terminator 2: Judgement Day deja vu. The real problem here is that the ball is too heavy. With Duracell batteries in it, mine weighed three quarters of a pound. The weighty ball clatters with alarming volume against the hoop and backboard and it's difficult to play without endangering delicate objects in the house. Was this not the mission of Nerf? By the way, the Firewire technology has nothing to do with the popular computer bus."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS !!,"What a piece of garbage !! First of all, I had to return & exchange this because the ball wouldn't light up & the rim only lit up partially.The ball is way to heavy. It is so heavy that it makes a huge noise when hitting the board or door, when hitting the floor it sounds like a bowling ball ! The rim is very flimsy and lightweight, it has a hard time withstanding the weight of the force from the heavy ball.My kids use the rim with another brand foam ball.This is definitely a waste of money & a huge disappointment."
5,Don Bachardy is lovely,Don Bachardy is lovely and his prose are just as great as his paintings and drawings. Would recommend this book for anyone interested in celebrities and/or Don Bachardy's work.
3,But Poison in His Pen!,"Bachardy's skill as an artist is evident. The book demonstrates that with his recognizably stylish renderings of celebrities who have subjected themselves to a sitting. Most of his subjects must be very sorry they did! The portraits are never flattering although always interesting. The basis for the book is not the art, but Mr. Bachardy's tattle-tale telling of the circumstances of the sitting. He may visually nail his subjects with the portraits, but he crucifies them with the stories he tells. He may have stars in his eyes (accessible to him through his lifelong connection with Isherwood, of course), but he has poison in his pen and no love for his subjects in his heart."
2,inferior product,"I also bought a 12"" cast iron enamel skillet to get away from teflon. I enjoyed the skillet for 2 months before the enamel flaked off! About the size of a quarter. I went against my best judgement and bought this product even though i knew it was made in China. I'm not bashing the Chinese but it seems that the idea of profits out weighs the quality of the product. I don't plan on returning this for an exchange. I put it in the recycling bin where it belongs. I will not purchase anymore of these products or any others manufactured in China."
3,Cheaper than La Crueset,"For the price, this is a good buy. Though both interior and exterior coatings are rather thin, the pan still did its job. The three stars are due to the thin coating -- not sure how long it will hold up to heavy use."
3,Bose,"I had to purchase this system in order to get WHITE speakers to go with a receiver I already had. The speakers are great, it's just that the woofer is SO big and SO heavy. In this day of shrinking electronics, I don't understand why. This is not the fault of the vendor - it is the manufacturer. All of Bose' new systems are BLACK - esthetically not good on the walls!The system arrived on time and works as expected."
4,Handy Little Tool,Has performed its duties well. Occasionally has trouble igniting. Blasting it with some compressed air remedies this minor shortcoming. Overall I'm pleased.
3,Repetitive Stress Injury in the Making,"I remember when you could find these torches in any hardware store for about $5, and they didn't have the aggravating child safety interlock. The safety interlock is a repetitive stress injury waiting to happen. If you don't have kids, I'd suggest defeating it. Side cutters and a file do the trick.I intend to use it to start up my wood burning stove without using kindling. A plain old lighter doesn't work to good but this torch will get a left over piece of charcoal or bunt wood going good, and 2 minutes of blowing on the ember surrounded by a pile of left over charcoals and you've got fire. Sure beats making kindling and using the pyramid kindling pile method of starting a fire."
2,Not a hiking guide......,"The 5 star reviews must have been written by friends. The hiking directions in paragraph form, which is not useful. Drive here, walk over the bridge, bear left, walk 0.5 miles, walk through the meadow, turn left at the stump(there are hundreds around). Half the time we did not know if we were going the right direction or not.Many of these hikes are MUCH easier to find and perform than the book describes. You can just as much useful help from the guide and the tourist traps in the area.Pictures of remote wooded areas should also include pictures of the entrance areas and trail heads.The maps are not detailed enough and quite amateurishly drawn. I am not quite sure what ""accurate"" means to other reviewers, but here in 2012 people use new-fangled devices with GPS tracking.The historical information is the most interesting and useful part of this book. This book should be priced at around $8.00. Forget it for a hiking ""guide"", but it's ok for a description of the trails."
3,A Simple Diet and a Bunch of Mediocre Recipes,"This book will not please everyone. I ordered it because it has a VERY simple diet plan that I remember and was very successful with when I was in high school. The diet plan will fit on a 3 x 5 index card. The many recipes are fairly uncreative, as a result of the very restrivtive nature of this diet. But I like the book because Jean Nidetch had a great and humorous philosophy. Most modern readers will find it silly, and miss the gimmicks and substuitutes that are heralded in today's dieting trends."
1,Material and workmanship were deplorable.,"Pages started falling out when I first started reading this book. The binding came completely apart before I was one-third through the book. What a mess. To add insult to injury, I bought the book new and it was overpriced!"
3,Good but they ruined the track listing!,"This was a great compilation unfortunately lessened by the song selection. The former version had Juke Box Music and MOST ESPECIALLY, the live version of Celluloid Heroes.(I still can't belive that was deleted.) It was done so because there would ultimately be no reason to buy the Top of the Pops disc, making it the way to own that song. If they were going to change the music that much, they should have left the track listing as it was and added ""Hatred"" at the end and called it '77 to '93. All they had to do was ask, it could have been the perfect greatest hits collection for their Arista years."
3,"So, so Kinks collection","I beleive the Kinks peaked in the 60's and ""Lola"" in 1970 so this ""1977-1986 best of"" falls short to me. Two of the best songs on this collection are live versions of older songs pre-1977(""Lola"" and ""You Really Got Me""). ""Come Dancing"",and ""Father Christmas"" are the true hits on this collection, besides the live versions of the older songs. ""Destroyer"" is a stand out rocker that sounds alot like there hit from 1964 ""All Day and All of the Night"". So you have five excellent songs and a bunch of so-so songs. In the 60's these guys were huge and really way ahead of there time so if you want there best get a compilation with their earlier songs and maybe just download ""Come Dancing"", ""Father Christmas""."
2,Come Dancing: The Best of The Kinks 1977-1986 SACD.,"Did not survive over time. Just a nostalgic, familiar sound for some. I would say, say good-buy to those music. it is not T.Rex or David Bowie whose best (only) works survived over time."
4,Almost perfect....,"This cd is great but it is missing one of my favorite songs. How can they leave out ""Dedicated Follower of Fashion""? That song is great and definately deserves to be on this cd. Otherwise I have no complaints about this cd. I never get tired of hearing ""Lola"" (I still laugh everytime I hear ""She walks like a woman and talks like a man..."". Overall this is a great collection of the Kinks and you should definately pick up this cd if you're a Kinks fan."
1,"If you enjoy Klassic Kinks, This album's not for you!","This album may have live versions of kinks klassics, but in no way is that worth purchasing this. I dont know what happened to the kinks in '77, they lost sight of the original sound and tried to get on MTV. This album is garbage. For a great kinks record, grab ""Everybody's in showbiz"", this has a whole album (probably their last great work) and a nice live show consiting off classics, mostly off of ""Lola vs. Powerman and the Moneygoround"" and ""Muswell Hillbillies"". Your money would be better spent on any of those afformentioned albums. Rock on with your bad selves...."
3,Bait and switch,"I know I should have done my homework on this one a bit more, but I didn't realize the collection was 1977-1986, which excludes Lola and You Really Got Me. They show up right there in the track list with absolutely no indication that they're live recordings. It's not hard to put the track list down with ""Lola (Live)"" and ""You Really Got Me (Live)"". I guess they realized people wouldn't buy that, so they decided to withhold that information. Cherry Cola? No thanks."
4,Some classics,"The price was right to purchase this for the songs I wanted. Some of the others...well, I won't download to my phone and take up space there, but it's good to have them all to access."
3,2nd rate Kinks,"I love the Kinks, make no mistake. If you've seen my other reviews, you can tell. But, this collection focuses too much on times in their career when they weren't producing their best stuff. I've never been a particular fan of their recorded output during what I think of as their ""arena rock era"", though I can tell, from footage I've seen (wasn't that lucky to have seen them in person), that they really must have kicked tail live...An aside: anyone ever notice how similar the chord structures to ""Misfits"" and ""Don't Forget to Dance"" are? Doesn't really matter though - they both deserve to exist and are two of the better tunes here..."
4,Really good!!,Tried it and loved it. Only drawback is that its on the medium control side and doesnt have as much shine as the gel. I hope Redken comes out with a rewind equivalent in the 16-26 range.
3,Lots of Facts and Figures...,"If you're looking for a book with all the stats on Alaska, this is the place to find it. A handy ready-reference book, this interesting read covers everything from the average rainfall in Ketchikan to the population of the smallest incorporated community in Alaska (Adak Station, pop. 7, if you're interested)While it does contain a number of interesting facts and figures, don't look here for a Cruisers guide to the Inside Passage or an insiders look at Denali. The various sidenotes and facts by ""Mr. Whitekeys"" make for an interesting, entertaining addition to an otherwise vanilla statistics book (i.e. Alaskans are the second-highest per-capita consumers of S.P.A.M in the country), but other than a rare chuckle here and there based on Mr. Whitekey's comments, I found this book generally to be a bland compilation of stats, meaningful only to a seasonal traveller to the state, or a seasoned sourdough, passionate about Alaska."
3,Lindos colores por fuera pero ningun color por dentro,"Compre este libro para regalarselo a mi padre que le fascina el estudio de los beneficios que contienen las frutas y hierbas. Creo que comparado con otros libros del mismo tema, este resulta aburrido ya que no contiene ejemplos visuales que suelen ayudar a la persona reconocer differentes hierbas cuando deciden usarlas."
3,Ok Jumper/Booster Cables,"First of all, when I got my shipment the box the cables come in was thrashed. Second the construction of this item is mediocre, I guess there isn't much to say about jumper cables as long as they work and they work."
3,An extraordinarily ordinary singer and effort.,"Danny O'Flaherty is a capable singer and in a live pub setting is probably very entertaining. However, an entertaining pub singer does not always make consistantly interesting recordings. This album is somewhat of an emotional pander. More of the same ""lovely"" Irish love songs. It could use more bite and a great deal more variety. ""E"" for effort, but give a little more of it next outing."
4,No Man of Her Own,This movie is quite funny and both Lombard and Gable are great! I however felt that the relationship between the two characters could have been developed a little more. It was as though their getting to know each other was rushed through. Other than that it is a def. great classic! Just not one of the best. =)
4,Famous Couple,"No Man of Her Own is the story of a glamorous small town girl (Carole Lombard) who longs to break free from her monotonous life as a librarian. She finds her escape when she meets Babe the gambler (Clark Gable) who makes his money by scheming with a few buddies. By the flip of a coin they are married, and they find it hard coping with each other's expectations.This film is most widely known as the only film to star the famous couple of Lombard and Gable, often thought to be Gable's only real love. The two have great chemistry and are sufficient enough to have garnered further films together; it is strange they did not, especially after their marriage.This early film utilizes some scandalous images later banned from the screen including Lombard in her underwear and Gable from the waist up in the shower.The picture is great, and the film makes use of some really beautiful shots, especially those set in the library.Overall, this is a good, highly entertaining romantic film."
2,Gable and Lombard together on the screen.,"What a pity these two compatible actors and partners could not have had better material to work with. I found the premise unbelievable and the story boring. It wasn't Gable and Lombard's fault, but they must have had opportunity to match up again?"
1,"Version Review, Not Movie Review","PLEASE NOTE: This is not COLOR as it states on the product description. It was filmed in B/W and this version is COLORIZED, i.e., fake computer generated color was added later. If that appeals to you, great. However, it is deceptive to not plainly state so in the product description. Filmed in color and artificial color added later are two entirely different things. Those of us who would watch anything from the 30's filmed in Technicolor just for the eye candy appeal could not care less about fake or enhanced B/W films. Universal is notorious for this fake COLOR thing, obviously to appeal to contemporary people who won't watch anything unless it is in color.By the way, I downloaded this from a site with a name similar to mooviebarry dot com for 87 cents. Great film."
5,A good Carole Lombard movie,"My wife is a great fan of Carole Lombard anr her movies are hard to find since she is long gone, except at Amazon.com"
3,Mudder is an ok book,"man... mudder is the greatest band of all time. C-bone is a great guy too. He saings like a madman. I am sad to see theat they got rid of dusty, but if they had to do that, then i guess it was the best choice for th badn to succede. my fav song is fullscal war"
4,Decline and Fall from Prez to Poop,"This is not a bad overview of American popular music. Mr. Clarke is clearly a jazz fan who regards the days of Lester Young, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, et al. as the high point from which we have declined, and sees the present state of commercial popular music as a ""culture of musical impoverishment."" The career of A&R man Mitch Miller, the evil genius whose venality and lack of taste was a landmark in adult pop's precipitous decline in the 1950s, is touchingly portrayed. I think Clarke's conclusions are correct; however, this is a matter of taste to some degree. Many will think differently, no doubt. Read it anyway, along with Will Friedwald's history of Jazz Singing."
2,Exhaustive and exhausting review of music,"All good books should tell a good story, but regrettably this one doesn't. While this tome is encyclopedic in its breadth it's lacking in depth or heart and reads like a graduate student's thesis. I was disappointed."
2,unfounded opinions,"The premise of this book was largely in editorial fashion. I accept this as his perogative however his views were often weakly supported and as a result unfounded. For example he lunches into a discussion about the racial struggles in the music industry. At the end of this section on rap music the reader only comes away with the taste of prejudism in her mouth (and I don't even advocate ganster rap music). The two stars I gave in the rating above were for the presentation of a comprehensive history which I respect. This book is required for a class of mine at the University of Toronto but the material is much too slanted for use as an introduction to the history of popular music. Therefore if you already have a good knowledge in this area and are intersted in new perspectives then this would be the book for you. Otherwise, I would reccomend you read something else first."
2,Eurotrash of the lowest quality!,"The film that almost destroyed Jean Rollin! A town is beseiged by green eyed zombies and continuity errors! See actors working in slow motion due to a speeded up camera!I saw this film on video years ago and despite it being terrible, I'll be first to order it on DVD. Jean Rollin came in to finish it off for Eurocine (According to IMMORAL TALES, the book.) and his career suffered as a result.The story involves a bunch of German soldiers who were murdered and chucked in a lake. Now they rise to take revenge on the townspeople... strangely, they still have their boots on (Despite earlier scenes showing them taken off when they were killed!)"
4,Zombie Lake is quite entertaining...,"The video box reads... ""The Most Terrifying Zombie Massacre Ever To Come To The Screen"". In truth, it is quite possibly ""The Worse Zombie Massacre to Ever Come to Any Screen"". I am a fan of laughably bad ""B"" Cinema, and enjoyed this very much. No one should take it seriously. Its no Dawn Of The Dead and will never be. Its a peice of eurotrash Cinema about Nazi Zombies who emerge from a lake wearing horribly done green makeup, and feed on bare breasted beauties who dare to swim in said lake. So, basically... the whole movie is an excuse for gratutious nudity and zombie carnage. I love it! If you want a new peice of cheese you can laugh at and add to your collection, pick this one up."
1,"Hilariously Awful, but Still Fun","This was another one of those movies that used to be packed in those huge boxes at the video store (i know you remember them) and one drug induced evening i rented this, I spit on your grave, and something else (for arguments sake lets just say Goulies) I laughed so hard during this movie i spewed Mountain Dew all over my sofa. The zombie makeup is awesome, they are basically just painted green with black circles around their eyes and throughout the movie the makeup keeps getting either washed off or rubbed off, the zombies do spend alot of time in the water. There is an extreme amount of nudity in this movie and for no good reason except for the sake of nudity (look for the scene with the troop of girls in the VW bus.) Anyway, if you are a fan of bad movies, i would highly suggest this one to add to your collection. So, invite some friends over, order some pizza, crack open a cold one and get ready for a hilarious zombie experience."
2,"A ""Must Have"" Zombie film for Zombie Film Fanatics!","Anyone who collects zombie films, MUST have this film! Here's why... Anytime, and I mean anytime, someone says they saw the worst zombie film ever. You hand them this movie... Unless they were speaking of Zombie Lake. No zombie film collection is complete without the worst zombie film ever made! If you can pick it up for $5, well... you spent more on the DVD than they did making the movie. 2 out of 5 stars for the nudity."
3,Strange but entertaining.,"If you cross the three genres horror, soft porn and family drama you get Zombie Lake. It was probably hard for the distributors to find an audience for this one. None of the genres work very well in this film expect the nudity of course. But it tends to be more comical than erotic especially in the scene where the female basket team baths nude in the lake. The music in that scene must be heard to be believed. Howard Vernon, who plays the mayor, gives the film some dignity it maybe don't deserve. This is much worser than Oasis of the Zombies and the zombie make-up is so bad you won't believe your eyes. It's so bad it's hard to think intelligent people has made it. But at the same time it's entertaining to watch so I give it three stars anyway. Fans of bad euro films may like it, but others probably want to stay away from it."
3,Wonderfully awful,"What happened??!! The other film, known as ""Pesticide"", was so moody and cute.This one is really amateurish, stupid, so worse that you MUST see to believe. You MUST have it and store it -as the black sheep- next to ""Shock Waves""."
5,Romantic and strangely beautiful film.,"Almost all of the previous reviewers gotthis totally wrong.I found this movie very romantic,haunting andstrangelybeautiful."
2,Most terrifying zombie massacre to come to the big screen...,"Thats exactly wat it isnt. IT isnt scary at all man what a bad movie. The reason i gave it 2 stars because of the idea, nazi zombies. The makeup is horrible. The worst part is the dubbing on this movie. WOW one of the worst dubbing ever. .... FYI: DONT BUY THIS MOVIE."
3,good lord,"man, what a movie. i rented this when i was very young hoping to be scared...the cover scared me, but man all i did was watch the first scean with the naked women..anyways.this movie is REALLY bad. i mean i had to show this to people to prove how terriable it was. man, it's horrid. lots of makeout flaws...i guess they only had so much green paint to go around. i would suggest to rent this. dont buy it."
1,Zombie Lake is a bad movie,"Bad movie all around, all the zombies have bad makeup except for two which they barely use, there is not even enough gore, the extent of the gore is red peanut butter on the neck of the victim, even the dubbing sucks, when the zombies are shot they don't even have a reaction and arent even affected by headshots, almost half the movie is a boring flashback to world war ii, it has a dumb love story that barely affects the movie, this should be one of the last films you buy if your looking to complete a zombie movie collection, definitely not worth 10$"
1,GREEN DEATH ?,"GREEN NAZI ZOMBIES COMING FROM THE BOTTOM OF A SWIMMING POOL TO FEED ON THE LIVING? AUGHH!!! BAD ACTING, BAD DIRECTION, TERRIBLE GORE, TOO LONG FLASHBACK HORRABLE DUBING AND THE PORN MUSIC IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE TELLS YOU WERE THEY WANTED TO GO WITH THIS PICTURE. DAMN THIS MOVIE SUCKS....."
3,COOL BUT NOT SO COOL !,IT'S A EUROPEAN FILM ABOUT THESE GERMAN ZOMBIES THAT COME OUT OF A LAKE SOUNDS SCARY BUT IT'S NOT!THEY COULD OF ADDED MORE ZOMBIES IT'S ONLY LIKE A PLATOON OR SO IT MOSTLY TAKES PLACE IN DAYLIGHT WHICH MAKES IT LESS SCARRY THERE'S SOME GERMAN OR FRENCH GIRLS THAT ARE NUDE WHICH IS COOL BUT OVERALL IT'S A LONG MOVIE AND NOT SCART IT'S GOOD FOR THE PRICE I ONLY PAID SIX OR SEVEN DOLLARS FOR IT BUT YOU MAY WANT TO SKIP IT FOR YOUR HORROR COLLECTION
2,The movie is about anatomy (Ha),"I saw this movie almost 20 years ago, and I have not watched it since. However, I remember almost 90% of it...that's how bad this film is. You want to know what the movie is really about? It's about b--bs floping around, and women getting naked for any reason. This movie is great for people who don't want to own porn. There really is not a lot of s-x in this film...just a lot of female anatomy flopping around, over, and under. If you don't want to see it as a horror film, then just buy it for it's naked qualities. The story line is basic, yet confusing, yet awful. I love bad films, but I still don't know if after 20 years I want to invest/see this movie again???? I probably will...boing boing..he he he he he he!The makeup is worse then that child's Halloween stuff you slap on your kids face every Halloween. Also, if my memory serves me right, this film was made in German? I don't remember? But I do know that the lip sync was not the best in the world."
2,should have listened to others and not wasted my money,"horrible movie, i gave it two stars for the great girl nudity in the film, of course if that's all i cared about i would have bought porno, the movie is just plain stupid, fake, the storyline was dumb, the music was really lame, cannot recommend this movie to anyone unless there is an actress you want to see in it for just about all of them seem to show something, will never watch again, i rate this movie with the other horrible ones i've bought recently, dead meat, city of the living dead as the worst zombie movies ever made, and i even liked children of the living dead and day of the dead 2, so i know im not being too hard on these movies, i just don't see the point of making movies this bad, what is the point, next time i start looking for horror movies i've never seen to satisfy me i will start being smarter in my choices for sure........"
2,Yup...It is only worth $10 not a penny more,The items in this package are inferior quality. The Car Charger doesn't lock into the phone so as you drive it beeps as it disconnects and reconnects to the charger. The home charger also does not lock into the phone but it does seem to work. The car mount and belt holster I threw away since they were made of cheap plastic and I would not trust either to keep my Blackjack from falling. You get what you pay for!
4,Nice product,"The sticky tab for the phone mount didn't do anything but leave the dashboard sticky, but the vent clip for the phone mount worked great. The phone mount fits almost any phone so my husband can use it for his phone as well."
2,Series of Unconnected Riffs...,"This video is little more than a series of thirty-odd unconnected Setzer-style riffs. There is little on the overall style of Setzer, and there is not one section that covers an entire song.The riffs presented are good enough - but the step by step parts could be slower.This DVD has about as little production value as can be.If you want to understand Setzer's stuff in a more comprehsensive fashion, get the Hot Licks video he did..."
4,A bit manic,Curt Mitchell is certainly enthusiastic. The instruction is sound enough although I think it could be a little more professionally produced and directed.
1,WORTHLESS!!!,"I have read this book, and really hated it. It is the story of a gold-digging wench who tries to run peoples lives for them. I especially disliked the part where the main character (the author personified) went to the bathroom all over herself in a mad frenzy to control her fiancee who enjoyed that type of behaviour. I would have given it 0 stars, but Amazon makes us have at least some faith in the book, which in this case, is undeserved. Thanks for reading."
3,story of adventure and winning against all odds,"This is a story of a woman who grew up the hard way and did whatever she could to survive.... It's an inspirational story of someone who got into and out of trouble, sometimes VERY humorously and sometimes put herself in great danger. You may not like her style, but she has a way of winning your heart. You travel with her as she goes across Europe, and becomes highly educated, and grows up along the way, despite herself, painfully and joyously.... it's a refreshing break from conventional norms of sexuality and convention, and may not be for everyone. You won't be bored, that's for sure!"
5,Splendid pieces,The product pieces came in very quickly and were just what I needed for my project! I can't wait to make another order of their fine products.
4,Daniel Boone The High Cumberland,"I always enjoy watching Daniel Boone. One thing I noticed about this movie is that it is a remake of the 1952 movie ""Bend Of The River"" starring Jimmy Stewart. Fess Parker is leading a wagon train to Kentucky and Jimmy Stewart is leading one to Oregon."
2,They used to be better...,"I bought 4 keyed alike Master locks about 10 years ago, MADE IN THE USA. They have been used on gates and sheds for 10 years and have NO RUST at all, and work smoothly. I bought some of these new MADE IN MEXICO Master Locks about a year ago, and now they are rusting and the action is jerky and they have to be fiddled with to open.Might as well buy the cheap Brinks Chinese ones, the Masters are double the price and not as good anymore... Sad. And I bet the Harvard Business School Graduates that run Master are sitting around pissed off that the cheap Chinese locks are eating their market share. Idiots."
1,Totally skippable.,"Aliens ""Book 1"" (called Aliens) really worth, a truly and almost perfect comics in b&W;, good story (with many surprises), good characters, good drawing (clear and good diagramed).Aliens Book 2 is a MASTERPIECE, a awesome drawing in a full color, and the story is really good.But Aliens Book 3 Earth War... stink!. Bad drawing (color but not full color like the previous aliens, only a ""old fashioned colored comics""), bad story (nobody wants to visit Earths, even for rescue!).IMHO Skip this comics and go ahead for the rest of the serie. This comics give nothing for the complete plot of the story."
2,Not a good movie,"This 1977 made-for-tv movie is certainly a more faithful adaptation of the classic novel than the latest movie, but aside from that, it has little going for it. The acting is subpar, the action sequences laughable, and the sets rather unconvincing."
4,Great Hand Mixer/ Yet Tireing to Hold,"It is a great mixer, veary powerfull, and gets the job done decently fast and well. Yet mixing for 5 minutes straight, your had gets tired so you set it on the edge of the bowl yet it doesnt really work well while sitting at the edge. Some times when you press down hard against the bottom to scrape maybe flower off, it starts to sound like it is struggling really bad, but it hasnt givin out yet, so I see no reason not to give it a harder time"
4,fertilome,I swear by fertilome productsand this one does what it say's.it stimulates root development to maintaina healthy vigorous plant from the root up...
3,Not a full account,It tries to be a difficult workbook but it doesn't give all the information it needs for a full analysis.
3,Too difficult?,"My friend purchased this book while we were reviewing for the AP US History exam and I glanced through it quite a bit. All the practice questions were extremely difficult and between the two of us, we got most of them wrong. I thought the questions on the actual exam were much, much easier."
2,"Hauls a big load, but poorly constructed.","When I need to haul most of my stands on location, I load them all up, with other grip gear, into this large wheeled case. It isn't as stable as I would like, thin molded plastic tends to twist when the case, so the clasps sometimes take a bit of encouragement to close correctly.The first time I shipped this FedEx Ground, it totally fell apart. The handles cracked and fell off, the bumpers fell apart, and most important one of the wheels completely came off...I did send it back to SBK for warranty repair/replacement, and they are in the process of making good on it.It's probably great for storage and light transportation, but be careful if you pack it too much, won't do well with heavy loads."
5,Salvation,This album is to tight that i wish everybody had it this guy is so unique that i like listening to it over and over again the song pain man that song keeps it so real that i don't know why he not popin all over the air waves this guy is got it going on with this flow and i do not give props unless they are well deserved and his are 10 starezs chance 17
4,"Beware! Start reading early, you not be able to put it down!","This book was awsome! Very intense and a real nail biter! I loved the way the author put you in the minds of all the characters involved. I started the book late in the eveining and ended up staying up all night long. There just was not a stopping point, I literally could not put the book down until I found out if Emily was able to escape her real-life nightmare! Oh! My poor nails! The only reason I did not give it five stars is because of the ending. I wish the author would have told in more detail of what happened to all the characters. Still, I would recommend this to anyone who loves suspense. It was a wonderful fast paced book. I have no idea why the other people say this book was slow and boring. Are they sure it was THIS book they were reading?!?"
3,It had me until the end,"Well, given the subject matter and the endearing child, the book does work up a fair amount of tension and it does keep you turning the pages. But the ending slides into a morass of cliche, bad dialogue and facile plotting which pretty well precludes me from recommending it"
3,"Early Wiggles, but it sure doesn't bother my 3 year-old","I grabbed this DVD in a haste and didn't pay attention to the fact that it was REALLY early Wiggles stuff.On the first viewing, I couldn't stop groaning at how simplistic everything was.But my 3 year-old girl absolutely LOVED it, and 3 months later, she still wants to watch it several times a week. She actually wants to watch it more, but I've cut back her TV time.Now, I actually watch this DVD with her almost every time. I find it hilarious to see Anthony before a hair and makeup person got ahold of him and a cardboard version of the Big Red Car.So, in summary, if your kids are huge Wiggles fans, this DVD is worth it at the slightly lower price than the other Wiggles DVDs."
3,Good - but old!,You can tell that this was a very early version of the Wiggles - they have come a long way since this was produced! I wish that they wouldof redone this with the newer costumes and song versions. Oh well - my son still loves it! And that is all that counts.
2,A Very Dated and Low Budget Video...buy the CD instead,"After buying the Yummy Yummy DVD (which I highly recommend), this is a disappointment. Compared to their later work, the 1995 release ""Dance Party"" is second rate in regards to its overall production. The Wiggles were obviously just feeling their way at this point, and needed a good production company to transform them into part of the Disney marketing machine :) If nothing else, it is fascinating to observe the contrast between the Wiggles of yesterday and today. The way Anthony looked back then is pretty wild!Most importantly, my son is not nearly as engaged in this video as with Yummy Yummy. With that said, most of the music is pretty good and worthy of buying on CD."
4,"Oldie but, a GOODY!","Don't be so hard on our Wigglin' Men from down Under. Yes we were all spoiled after Toot-Toot. So...Lyrick/Hit repackaged a tape from 1995, an Oldie is still a Goodie! So... the tape's alittle old. It's nice to see Wiggles history (us Yanks haven't gotten a chance). So ""cutie"" Anthony has ""youthful"" hair, THE WIGGLES Rule! I guarantee you WILL be humming 5 Little Joeys, Di Dicki Do, I'M A COW, The Flap, Nicky Nocky, On Your Holiday,etc. Isn't THAT what it's all about! Very good tape. (It's great seeing most of the guys have solos too!)Wigglin in Jersey Jamie's and Jo-Jo's Mom p.s. it is an Award Winner"
3,"Your kid/s will like it, but.....","This video looks like a [dollar] store one, i mean, image/sound quality is poor (if they did it with the money they have now, it would be awesome). Because of this, it takes a few times watching it until u start liking it, but the kids liked it from the beggining. Missing the ""real"" Capt. Feathersword here (Paul Paddick). The quartet looks like they're in their 20's (Anthony, u really needed a barber!!). But who cares...NOT THE KIDS, they don't notice the low budget as we do. My oldest son (2 yrs) watches it more than ""Hoop-dee-Doo"" which is very well made. So go on, i don't think it'll be wasted money."
4,It's all about the Kids,"OK, Anthony needs a serious haircut in this one, there are 3 Captain Featherswords (the field brothers actually), the video quality is poor and the sound quality isnt much better, BUT this is an excellent video. The music is very good and it is very entertaining for my little boy. It is a classic wiggles video. It has all the elements of what makes the wiggles such hits, great music, easy dances, and 4 colorful guys with their wiggly friends Wags, Dorothy, the Captain and Henry the Octopus. I would love to see them remake this video but since I dont see that happening in the near future I would say that this is a great video that your children will love (just make sure that your kids dont see you laughing at it as they are watching)"
2,The Wiggles cashing out? Not too hot...,"Our 2 year olds love the Wiggles, but they actually walked out of the room on this video! Almost looks like The Wiggles are cashing out by publishing obviously OLD videos of theirs as a ""new release"". Maybe its their publisher doing this, but the quality is poor compared to more recent productions, and some of the songs are actually pretty lame (also compared to more recent productions). If you are a Wiggles fanatic, you'll probably buy this anyway, but you'll be disappointed. If you're new to The Wiggles, don't buy this: buy Wiggle Time, Wake Up Jeff, Toot Toot, or Yummy Yummy instead. Those will not disappoint."
4,"Poor quality, GOOD tunes!","Our 2.5 year old and 15 month old are insanely into the Wiggles. It is truly scary. First viewing of this video left me feeling like they wouldn't want to see it again. Bad quality sound and visuals. HOWEVER, for some reason, this is the one they want to watch over and over again. And I have to say the tunes are very catchy. Many times I have found myself humming ""The Friendly Pirate Ship"" at work (so much for that promotion). I think this one is worth buying, even though it can be hard to look at. Let's face it, the quality on the others is just barely better than amatuer anyway. Kids just love these guys."
2,We love The Wiggles but..... This was not good!,The new video Dance Party must have been when they just started out cause even the Big Red Car was made out of plywood. My kids still danced but when it was over they wanted to watch Yummy Yummy video instead. The songs are not as fun as in there other videos.
1,Stick to Wiggle Time,".... Wiggle Time was a big hit (and still is) with my 18 month old granddaughter but this movie was not. After 15 minutes of watching Dance Party she pulled out the old Wiggle Time and try to insert it into the VCR. I couldn't blame her the video looks worst than my backyard movies, the sound is no better and the foursome act like they would rather be someplace else (not to mention that Henry the Octopus' head looks as if it will come off any minute). For all Wiggle Time is; Dance Party IS NOT."
1,Wiggles-Dance Party,I would highly recommend purchasing a different video. I was not impressed. I have other Wiggles videos and was very disappointed to find out this was from their classic collection. It looked like it was filmed in their basement. The description said from 2002. Think twice before spending your money.
1,Absolutely awful!,The Wiggles - Dance PartyThis item was advertised as new and actually had good reviews. bought it for my Grandson for Xmas and is VERY obviously a pirate video. The music was fine but the picture was very distorted and did not correspond to the music at all.I was extremely disappointed and wanted Amazon to know that someone is using their site and reputation to sell pirate dvds
1,Not very good quality,My 15 month old loves the wiggles! anything wiggles. when he received this DVD he saw the pic and was super excited. But when i started the DVD it was a whole different story. The picture was very faded and he just didn't care much for it. We took it out and haven't gone back to it since.
4,Too much songs.,My daughter likes it at the beginning but then seems to get bored. I think that is too much songs without something else between it that can make the video more entertainment.
4,fun little dvd,"we bought this because we were going on a 15 hour car ride vacation and I wanted something to keep my 15 mth entertained. he was in love with the wiggles (i didnt know who they were) and he ""asked"" for them every time we got back in the car. Those men are a tad bit silly but that is why babies love them i suppose. my son dances and ""wiggles"" right along with them and I am looking to get a few more dvds. I would definitely recommend it for any age"
3,wiggly fun,"Thank goodness! Finally a video that is fun for my children and doesn't drive me nuts! These guys are infectious! My children laugh, dance and sing together like never before. And I can stand to hear them everyday. In the car and at home. In fact not a day goes by that we don't listen or watch the Wiggles. This isn't their best video but definately worth the $$. Move over Barney! The Wiggles are in town!"
2,The Wiggles - Dance Party,"As you will see in the other reviews, the quality of this video is less than spectacular. The lighting is poor, the costumes are not first class and the overall production is not up to Wiggles standards. If you have any of the other Wiggles videos, you'll know all the songs. That being said, my 2 yr old son still loves it. Kids aren't as subjective as parents when it comes to production values. And this video has been played at least 50 times since we've bought it. The quality wasn't what I expected from previous videos."
2,Terrible--should be reproduced completely,"My 2 kids are devoted Wiggles fans (ok I admit it, I like them too), but the production quality of this video is just terrible. This must be one of the first videos they ever made. They don't even have any Wiggles logos on their shirts, and it looks like they woke Anthony up off a park bench and put him in the film. Also, Capt. Feathersword is played by at least two different guys (one of them, yep Anthony), which drew protest from my oldest (I think Capt. F is his favorite character). The Big Red Car is nothing more than a painted cardboard prop. The ONLY thing that makes this video worth buying (and I don't recommend it) is because they guys have their trademark creativity and silliness, which is somewhat lacking in their more recent productions. The songs are ok, and this would probably be a decent video if they would only reproduce it according to modern Wiggles standards. My advice: Buy Wiggle Time instead."
2,Didn't keep my kid entertained,"I felt bad buying this CD for my child ($16 at that). The video was made in such poor quality and it looked like something made back in the 80s. There were rarley any props, and the dog and dinoaur's costume looked as if it were rented from a ragety costume shop. Sorry, but this video could not keep my little one entertained!"
1,"Don't buy ""classic"" Wiggles","This DVD is awful! My 18 month old can even tell the difference. It looks to be from at least 5 years ago, well before The Wiggles were successful. And it shows. The quality of the video itself is poor, and the performances are not much better. Very amateurish. I strongly suggest staying away from this DVD."
2,An older DVD,"I was excited to unwrap this dvd until I watched it. The audio is poor and it is probably the first video they made. It leaves alot to be desired visually as well. They had to start somewhere, but this seems like a bootleg copy of a concert. The wake up Jeff VHS is equally as poor with the audio and visual aspects. The big red car is card board in both videos.Be sure to look at the year of release. If your kids love the current Wiggles they will probably not be interested in either of these.I admit I was interested to see how blazay the Characters were at first and how awful the clothes were. Anthony was Cpt. Feathersword before they got Paul Paddock."
3,Old school wiggles,The big red car is just a cardboard cut out! Interesting to see how far the Wiggles have come from their early days. Several fun songs despite lame stage sets
1,do not recommend,My son loves the Wiggles Toot-Toot & Wiggle Time videos but this one is terrible. It appears to be old clips from when they first started out. There is no computer graphics and the characters costumes are not as good. The songs are also not very good. This video is very misleading as it being a new release you would think it is new materal but don't be fooled. We are very disappointed.
2,WARNING!!!,"Hi Everyone: I am a Dad of a 2 year old that loves the Wiggles. Actually I wonder if I like them more than she does. I just wanted to say I was disappointed with this Wiggles tape. I thought the 2001 release date meant ""new stuff"". This is older than old though. Unless you need them all stay away from this video. The audio sounds a bit lousy too. Granted to a 2 year old it doesn't matter. Spend your money on Wiggle Time if you are new to the Wiggles. Just my 2 cents.Wigglin in Mass."
1,Butchery,"I own this on Myto. The copy I got was edited to death. Maybe that's why Tower was willing to unload it for nine bucks. There is no orchestral prelude and no Dance of the Hours. Why? Maybe they ran out of tape.Randova and Paskalis are superb but you don't buy La Gioconda for Laura and Barnaba.I loved Leonie Rysanek--she was among the most exciting dramatic sopranos I ever saw--but she was not a Gioconda. All her vocal flaws were set off in relief. And that day, Franco Tagliavini couldn't have won a hog-calling contest."
1,Unfulfilled order,"After placing an order with Christian V on August 28th, I did not receive my book in a timely manner. I checked my account with Amazon and found a notation stating, ""Expected delivery -- Sept. 3rd -- Sept. 21"" I also found this note, ""This item will be shipped soon, order cannot be canceled or changed."" I waited, and after ten more days, still had received no book. I have now no choice but to cancel this order, and will not authorize payment if it is charged against my account."
4,Beautiful,"I bought this watch for my boyfriend. It's very beautiful and he loves it. Wears it constantly. However, I bought it for his birthday in early Nov and by early Dec it's already scratched on the band. It scratches easily."
5,Great Deal,"comparing to its price this watch is a great deal, bulky look, nice design and good materials.more than i expected and i'm going to try more from FOSSIL."
4,Great Watch,I bought this watch for my Husband for Christmas! He loves it! It works perfectly and is big bulky like he wanted.
3,Sit Down Exercise CD,"It was too short...only 20 minutes, and most of that was instructions. But, its good for biginners, which I am, so I will use it and build up to a longer video."
5,"Nightmare in Death Valley, a wicked book!","I really loved this book, it's one of the best books i've read.I loved it when they set off, and I admired Elizabeths courage to lead the group through the valley.There were some scary moments, but thankfully they all escaped. I was shocked when one of the escaped convicts decided to turn over a new leaf, and help them escape from the valley.I would recomend this book to someone aged ten."
4,An intruiging tale of survival and criminal pursuit,"This book is based on a field trip taken by teenagers to a place called DEATH VALLEY.Yet who other than the Wakefield twins to go there in search of treasures. As they all are led astray by false hopes, or are they?.As the news travels that convicts are in the area the gang splits up and by doing so causing one disaster after another"
4,"All of the books are tragic, happy, fun and fullfilling!","I believe that Judith Pella, and Michael Phillips have created a wonderful story of love, loss, courage, and strength. The charaters are so real to life that I felt sad when I came to the end of the last book. It felt like I was losing some of my closest friends. I didn't want to stop reading any of the stories, at any point. The story is great, and the history surprisingly well written and accurate. Everyone should read this collection of books."
1,rusted in one year,"This lock lasted one year. It rusted out and the key would not turn, would not buy it again. I do recomend the Master Lock 911DPF Laminated Pin Tumbler Padlock, after 3 years still working like new."
2,This lock doesn't stay weather tight.,"The weather seal around the shackle loosens over time and lets in moisture which freezes. The only lock I find that works in winter weather are 'receiver locks"" that are used to lock a trailer hitch to a vehicle. (Sounds strange but they work). Just drop it down through your door latch with the rubber cap up. The rubber cap keeps moisture from getting in to the lock. The draw back is I have to switch back to using keys in the winter."
1,Self Published and it shows!,"Great concept with some decent research, but it is poorly executed. Fans of the film are often insulted when the book reads more like a cheap tract. The summaries to each chapter are a good example, this one is from a chapter on the agents:An Invitation to Apply the MessageRecognize Satan and his tactics.Satan has the ability to transform and camouflage himself.Satan chal lenges God's Word and manipulates it's meaning.Protect yourself with the Word of God and the Holy Spirit.The Christian themes abound in this film but this book oversimplifies them and ignores all of the other themes from literature, faith, anime, and philosophy. The film has likely inspired many sermons, but these are not good."
1,Matrix as Propoganda....don't waste your time,It is emberassing as a person of faith to see the Wachowski's story co-opted with complete disregard for the density of the film. I am reading all of the Matrix books out and each seems to have something different to offer. This book is the exception.
4,Great amp for the price.,i got the amp about 3 days ago. fast shipping . The amp pushes 2 10 in sony explodes pretty good. I still want more. Dont get mewrong this amp packs a punch . great amp. would recomend to anyone who wants good bass for a cheap price.
3,Reviewing the Mistress,"Mistress of Spices starts out somewhat difficult to follow. The first hundred pages seem to jump back and forth because they are introducing the main characters, but after they are all introduced, the book becomes a lot easier to keep up with. The storyline behind it all makes me think that it would be a good ABC movie. I love how the Lonely American (Raven) can see through her aged body and see the real Tilo. After she broke her first Mistress rule, it was almost like she thought, ""Well, I'm already in trouble, so I might as well make it worth while..."" Then after First Mother visited her and told her she only had three days, i was unable to put the book down. It ended nothing like I had imagined...but I can't tell you the ending or else I'll ruin it. But the book was definately worth reading if you can make it through the first 100 pages. Good Luck!"
2,"Very poorly made, save your money!!!!","Survived only the Barbie film it came with, which was only 12 exposures. Unable to advance film of new roll after only a few pictures were taken.When it did work it was not hard to operate.Improvements could be made easily without jacking up the price any further.Cost is somewhat steep for a manual camera."
1,the worst,"After receiving this toy, returning and replacing it,I gave up. This is pure junk! Spend a little more on a point and shoot camera because this is just a waste of money."
3,Decent choice for kids,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas last year. It's actually easy for her to use, although we have to load the film for her which uses the old winding method. She's not hard on her toys so we've had no issues with durability. The quality of the pictures is relatively good and the flash works well. She enjoys her camera but is ready to move up to digital! Overall we are pleased with this product."
3,Eddy Duchin - Best of the Big Bands,My rating of the subject matter might be a little low! I bought it for a gift so my opinion might not mean too much.I received it in good time from the seller and it was everything he said it would be.
5,Best book on best illustrator,"I'm in agreement with everyone else, that 1.) Robert Mcginnis is the best paperback book illustrator ever (perhaps rivaled only by Frank Frazetta); and 2.) This is the best collection of Mcginnis art available in book form. There's only one flaw in the whole thing: it never says what medium the artist uses (I found out it's egg tempera). If you love to gaze at beautiful paintings of every genre subject, or if you are yourself a painter or commercial artist, this belongs on your bookshelf. I've had it for years, and never tire of looking at it. A classic."
2,Euro Pro Lack of Overall Quality,"This item looked appealing, but based on other Euro Pro reviews on other Euro Pro product, I chose not to buy it. The majority of reviews I read on many Euro Pro products described high failure rate, poor quality, etc., etc. So much as I liked the price and concept, I'll pass as I hate companies who make crappy products then don't back them up ... having that reputation (compared to companies who are available, responsive, and stand behind what they make ... anything less, they can keep their product and forget obtaining my money."
5,Coincidence or something else,"This material doesn't really need any justification. If the ideas within fit with you, you will know to buy it. It was only by what seemed like a series of rare coincidences that I came across it. If you have made it this far, then maybe it is a forgone conclusion..."
3,Seth Speaks,Book was fine great transaction but I didn't understand most of what he they whatever were talking about. Sorry I need simpler language.
2,Good intentions...,"I don't think there's anything bad about this book. However I don't know if channeling the opinions of non-physical entities is exactly the best way to attain integrous spiritual knowledge. It seems like more of a distraction.Also, I was told once that if one is in the presence of, or in contact with, a non-physical being that if one doesn't feel an overwhelming sense of joy then it is best not to pay any attention to that being."
2,How to build a watch and more,"I suppose this book might be just what some people are looking for, but I found that it went into such minute detail that I finally quit trying to read the book. I'm surprised that this book is recommended as the first one a person should read if they are a Seth beginner. I personally don't think it is a great benefit to know the ""physics"" of a soul (so to speak)."
5,Seth Rocks,"Learning things I already knew, but finding my thought system verified through the words of Seth..you simply can't go wrong with ideas how to create your own personal reality."
3,SETH TACKLES THE SOUL,"ORIGINALLY PICKING THIS BOOK UP ONLY BECAUSE MY NAME IS SETH I BECAME ENTRANCED INTHE DEEP NATURE OF THE SUBJECT. IN A WAY UNIQUE TO THE SETH SERIES A WOMAN NAME JANECLAIMS SHE IS BEING CONTACTED THROUGH A ""BEING"" CALLED SETH. SETH TELLS HER THE SECRETSOF THE UNIVERSE, INCLUDING THE EVERLASTING SOUL. IT IS AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT WHO WE AREAND WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE. DESPITE BEING ON THE BORDER OF AN INTERSTING READ AND A OFF COLORREAD, SETH SPEAKS TO US AND MAKES US THINK."
1,Reader Beware!,"""Seth Speaks..."" is a reprint of a book published in the middle 1970s. Seth is a discarnate ""acendent master"" who no longer habitates our ""plane of consciencness"". Althoughhe does not have a need for a physical body heapparently has a need to ""channel"" through JaneRoberts body with information about the ""truenature of reality"" and the collected wisdom of theages. This book may contain elements of metaphysical truth. However, do not be beguiledinto accepting deception because it is also mixedwith truth!This book, along with a tape of one of the""Seth"" sessions, convinced me that Seth is a realpersonality. I was also modivated to put downthe book and discontinue my investigations intometaphysical ""truth"". This communication frombeyond the grave is a message spoken withforked tongue and with evil intent. Reader beware!"
1,More snake oil.,"I can't believe people are so gullible that they buy into these fakirs. What would be neat is if the ""Amazing Randi"" witnessed and critiqued these Seth sessions, I'm sure they would be exposed for the shams they are just like Uri Geller. The sleep deprivation these people practise are probably what causes them to believe their own lies. Stay awake long enough and you'll see and hear anything you want to. Trouble is when people like this try to make a buck off of it."
1,magnet for schizophrenics,"If your friend is reading this book, get them help! Ghosts and faries and goblins have no place in a sane mind."
5,Always eye-opening and expanding!,"This is the foundation of the entire metaphysical and spiritual-growth movement in our world today, the embracing of How It All Really Works, and the now-ever-more-rapidly expanding of our perception of how limited we've become and what the incredibly broad possibilities for our lives really are. This is a FASCINATING work, with Seth's information spanning the entire history of our world (known and unknown), and the fabulous, INCREDIBLE, magical and powerful potentials that are ours for the taking and using. The concurrent narrative of two people's reaching to handle this first-time-ever experience (of channeling, which has now grown into a commonplace and powerful resource for our personal growth) is a fascinating companion-aspect, allowing us to relate our own process and learn further how to bridge both our own physical, limited reality with the eternalness of our real selves. THIS IS THE PLACE TO START!"
5,Seth speaks truth,Seth speaks the truth! If you ever have doubts about this reality then this book will relieve you. It's a must read for people seeking the truth of reality.
3,Good reading,"This is a very good book, but it is difficult to read and digest. It has taken me a long time to get very far in the book. This is not one you can read through and get the gist of it. You must read and re-read to absorb the content."
5,"An excellent ""westernized"" overview of consiousness.","When the book was first recommended to me by friends, I was skeptical about a book that was ""channeled"" from a being not currently on Earth. After reading it, however, I found the concepts too fascinating to ignore. The style of writing can be distracting; alternating between the events that are happening during dictation (channeling) and the text of the dictation. The content of the material from Seth, however, is excellent and thoroughly thought provoking. It also rings true for me somewhere deep inside. I have read this book three times now over the last 10 years and always find something new and valuable. I highly recommend reading Seth Speaks, especially for anyone who finds the Western scientific model flawed and incomplete"
4,A Mind Blowing Journey into Dimensions,"One should see or read The Secret, or be familiar with Abraham-Hicks materials, or even the metaphysical before reading this book. Seth Speaks is the perfect book for those who believe in a multi-dimensional, energy driven world. It explains many facets of life, that are ignored or stuck in the category of hallucinations. Certainly it is a different slant on ""eternal life."" It gives new meaning to the dream state."
2,gimme a break,"I think most young skins and wannabes pick this album up because it is the most obvious 'Skinhead'record and therefore they HAVE to like it. Otherwise they might not be seen as skinhead enough.There are some good songs on here, such as King of the Jungle... but other songs, such as Freedom, just make me feel stupid. I agree with F.W. Skin, go pick up the split with Combat 84. Oh... and remind Roi about writing ""skinhead get your haircut"" before he wins the Ozzy Osbourne look-alike contest."
1,Not worth the money!,This book is poorly written. The solutions are often not explained well. There was no attempt by the author to properly subscript notation or uses his own notation. The problems are simple. A much better book is the 6 minute solutions - which I highly recommend. Don't waste your money on this book. One star is a high rating in my opinion.
1,"Fraught with Errors, Inconsistencies. Poorly-Written","Spend your money, and more importantly, time, elsewhere.I would imagine most folks interested in this text are preparing for the PE Exam. You should look elsewhere. Notably, the 6 Minutes Solutions book (Geotechnical) contains more breadth of problems, is nicely-divided into ""Breadth"" and ""Depth"" sections for study purposes, and *importantly* has minimal errors (the errors it does contain are corrected in an updated errata on the publisher's website).This text, conversely, is fraught with errors, includes simplistic problems that any PE candidate should already know, and is poorly-written and poorly-produced."
3,General information pre-dental students need to know.,"Overall a good book for pre-dental advice. No details about specific schools, but it gives a general idea of what you need to do when applying to dental school."
3,So-so,"While at the bookstore, I took a break from filling out applications and this was the only book that they carried which was created specifically for dental school applicants.The book is easy to read, but I didn't find it very useful. The information in there is pretty basic and generic, nothing that most people don't already know about how to get into school (ie - observe at a dentist's office, keep your grades up, do well on the DAT). On the plus side, the book does cover some studying tips, and in the back there are blank pages to record your own application process.I would recommend that you peruse the book if you happen to fall upon it at the book store -- I've seen it at several around town. However, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless you are looking for some elementary guidance."
4,Overall Good Book,This book was excellent with the respect that clearly illustrates how to be sucessfull with the all importnat interview. The book also gives some good tips on how to be a good student as well as how to manage ones budget will in school.
2,An easy read but not very useful,"This book is an easy read, however, much of the information is out of date. The book was written in 1999 and many things have changed since then. Also, the author has never applied to dental school and therefore doesn't really explain the ins and outs of the dental school application process. If you want to get accepted to dental school, check out the Ultimate Dental School Admission Guide instead at www.dentalschooladmission.com Just my 2 cents."
2,Pretty watch - pretty disappointing,"I like the watch, i bought it for my mom, it came quickly as advertised even during the holiday season. Just one thing, when i went to give it to my mother for christmas,as a present, the watch was BROKEN. The clasp was missing a pin that would keep it all together and it simply wasn't there. I'd send it back but since I live in Alaska, the shipping simply isn't worth it. I'll just have to have it repaired here and I certainly won't be buying gifts for people off amazon anymore."
4,good gift,"I bought this as a gift for my mom. She loved the watch when it arrived. The ""mother-of-pearl"" dial looks beautiful and adds the little extra surprise to the watch. The band was also resizable to fit her wrist perfectly. She is happy!"
2,spatula separated within 5 months,"I ordered a bunch of spatulas at one time. Can't say I have used them equally, so it's not a scientific test, but the head of this spatula has separated from the handle already--looks like it was held on with just a bit of glue. I will try to reglue it, but thought I would provide the feedback."
1,"Disappointed in Texas, but not over the book itself","Unfortunately, eventhough I ordered the book a month ago, the 3rd party seller still hasn't sent it to me. Sorry, this may not be the correct venue to voice this discontent, but I am pretty disgusted."
3,"O Brother, Beware !","We ordered this cartridge thinking it is the original. The product description says 'by Brother'. Upon receiving it (and another by the same seller), we found these are compatible cartridges. My old Brother 5640 got konked out as I had used compatible cartridges and Brother's warranty wouldn't cover it. So I felt deceived.These compatible cartridges may work fine, but if you have any problems just remember the warranty. I have used a few of these compatible ones for over a year and the price/value proposition is very good. But there is a risk in that, the printer may not recognize these cartridges and keeps asking for a new one. This is exactly what happened with our old printer.The seller acknowledge the error in the description, but after 10 days the description hasn't changed, making me believe it is intentional misleading. Are we shopping in the third world or what?"
1,Poor Distribution,When I first put this Magenta ink in the printer everything came out with a pinkish hue....too much Magenta. Now it seems to have run out without telling me because there seems to be no pink color anymore.
2,Ellis Peters he(?) is not,"If you are a fan of Ellis Peters work, prepare to be disappointed. If you want to read a really good medieval mystery, prepare to be disappointed. If the choices are reading this or People magazine, pick this up. While better than some others I've read, the ending is so contrived as to be ridiculous. I won't give it away but suffice it to say that it relies on a Deux et Machina twist so hamhanded that it made me regret wading through till the end.Oh, and I agree with those who call Sister Fidelma a self-righteous prig. She certainly is one."
4,Shroud for the Archbishop,"This is the second of the Sister Fidelma mysteries, in this case set in seventh century Rome. Once again the Irish sister is required to apply her skills as a highly respected officer of the law to identify the murderer. Tremayne's depiction of the political tensions within the church in 644 is insightful, so the mystery rattles along beside the observations of society at that time."
4,Old Irish mystery,"I read an earlier ""Sister Fidelma"" mystery and enjoyed it. My local library didn't have this one and it's the next one in the series. This was the first time I ordered from Amazon. Friends have been raving about it for years, but I'm a library person. Anyway -- service was great, the book, although used, was in good shape and the story was interesting."
2,Ugh,"While this book is, at its best, interesting, it is mainly a mire of predictability and has an overpowering sermonic bent. Sister Fidelma is written as being almost superhumanly righteous. It's quite difficult to like her. The adoration of her ethnic background is heavy-handed. The behaviour of the characters is definitely a bit modern for the time setting. Sister Fidelma is apparently a 17th century Catholic, but her views really seem to differ quite strongly from the religious standard of the day. Peter Tremayne, however, shows some promise as a writer. The book was quite readable, just improbable, and irritating at times."
2,"""Auto"" setting doesn't work??","I didn't expect a lot from a unit at this price, but this flash is too HOT!! The manual setting is useless for close-up, and the auto setting doesn't seem to make a bit of difference. But, like I said, at this proce, I can us some ND filters."
3,So Far So Good,"It's clear the other reviewers have had much difficulty with this product, therefore, I'd like to add that although I have had no problem with the function of the flash for the two years I've used it now, be warned that ""your mileage may vary"". I've used the flash for macro work, primarily insects. I generally shoot at f/16 and have been very pleased with the results. I've posted some of my shots on my Facebook page and if anyone cares to take a look they are welcome:[...] All of the shots in this album were taken with the Bower Ring Flash aboard my 100mm macro non-IS lens either with my Canon 7D or 50D.I am just starting to have difficulty now with the mechanism to tighten the flash down onto the hot shoe. I also agree with other reviewers that the instructions are quite lacking and build quality is only fair-good (but has lasted me 2 years).Do I wish I had the Canon Ring Light? Absolutely! and someday I probably will, but until then the Bower is working for me...so far so good."
5,South Parkateers Rejoice!,"Well, I must admit that only fans of South Park will enjoy this video. Since I am one, then I have to say that this is the best video for the well-adjusted person on your list. Not at all for the weak of stomach and the faint of heart, these two videos slam all valued cultural icons from Michael Jackson's Thriller video (Pinkeye) to Don King (Damian). There's also Jesus Christ fighting Satan in the second episode, and I won't tell you who won. Sure to offend anyone conservative enough to require offending, this little stocking stuffer is perfect for the hellion on your list--over 18, please!"
5,"A great satire, don't miss it!","The video begins with Pink Eye. A kind-of ""Night of the Living Dead"" spoof. Very, very funny. The next is ""Damien"" a take-off of ""The Omen"". In it Satan's son comes to elementary school, and Jesus must fight Satan for supremacy of the world. The ending was fantastic!"
3,Jumper Cables,"These cables are a good value. They work well enough if you're attaching them to automotive battery terminals; however, the jaws don't close together far enough to bite onto motorcycle/powersports type terminals, which limits their versatility."
4,"Probably overkill for my 1.4L engine, but whatever :-)","After accidentally including my last set of jumper cables with the sale of my last car, I was in need of new ones!These are long and heavy duty - probably overkill for my 1.4L engine, but if you needed to jump a truck, they would be great. The whole assembly is well put together, with good, solid connections from the handles to the cables. They have worked great on a hybrid Highlander and Chrysler 300 (co-worker left the dome light on in the company car...).If you don't have a lot of space though, skip this set since they are not small."
3,"Looks okay, but weak crimp",Mine just arrived. I pulled it out of the box and am concerned that the cable crimp looks weak. I expect eventually I will have to fix it if it gets used much. Other than that it looks like it will do the job.
5,"Great, heavy duty","I don't know what I can say about jumper cables. These are heavy, long enough for most occasions, and they work well. I'm very glad I bought them!"
4,"Small package, full of detailed insight","It's a rather small book, with twelve helpful articles. Some of the writing reads more like an inventory of sects than an interpretation of developments. But most of it is solid, interesting research and insight. The book covers the waterfront, with articles on each of the five officially recognized religions (Organized Daoism, Buddhism, Islam, Catholicism, and Protestantism), plus around half the book looks at less recognized ""popular"" religious cults. There are excellent surveys of evolving sects in Fujian, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. And Nancy Chen's article on healing sects sheds a lot of light on the whole tension over ""legitimate"" and ""illegitimate"" religion in recent years.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"
4,"Great epic, good translation","Beowulf is the most important traditional epic in the Old English language and, I would argue, the most important piece of ancient literature to read in English. It preserves the rich oral traditions from which it arose in all of its glory and is more accessible in this regard than the Homeric epics (to which it would be most closely compared) because the languages are more closely related and thus the forms are easier to keep intact (though this is still by no means easy).In general, I found Alexander's translation of this poem to be good. He obviously tries to keep close to the original and this is appreciated. However, since this is the apparent aim, the lack of a facing page translation format hurts this goal somewhat.All in all, this is a good translation of an important work."
1,A Bore,"Michael Alexander has done it again! How anyone can so consistently turn out bland, lifeless translations, I don't know! Is this the way they teach at St. Andrews? Zzzzz."
3,"Important, Tedious","This book is considered to be one of the most important pieces of early english literature. By virtue of this alone, most everyone who goes through high school is forced to read it. It reads as a mildly interesting narrative. This translation is decent but fails to bring the story really to life. Beowulf, here, is a laborius and uninvolving read. If you are reading this for fun, you are better off seeking another translation (like Seamus Heaney). I suppose everyone should read this book to make themselves more knowledgeable of english literature, but it requires a sheer act of will. Unless you are forced to read it or really want to read it, you will probably be bored by this translation."
1,3 Stooges Triple Whammy,Not happy....I thought this product contained theatrical shorts. I wanted film shorts not their history of their rise in Hollywood.
1,Absolutely NOT what I expected.,"Archival footage. I wanted Stooges for my kids, got this instead. This is NOT THREE STOOGES skits. This set is for historians, by historians.A grievous disappointment."
4,Rob Shields,"This is more like 4.5 stars. It's an excellent machine for increasing flexibilty. The only drawback is that the quick release doesn't always work (it sticks sometimes). Other than that, it's a solid, quality piece of equipment at a great price."
5,really works!!,"A lot of parts to assemble with weak instructions, but after you get passed that, it is a very sturdy machine that works very smoothly. not as heavy as i thought at about 50 pounds so u can move it around. its clicks are very close to eachother, and with a quick release latch gives u confidence in moving up a notch. im kicking the pads higher than ever now."
4,tankyou,is good but in the first page said the deliberi is free ober 100$ and you char me tha and takes mor time thensaid the first page tank you
4,Perect Streching machine,"Despite what the other reviews stated, I had no issues assembling this machine. It works great and we've already seen improvements. It easily stores in the corner so we can readily use it while watching TV or hanging out in the living room..."
4,Great Customer Service,"Outstanding customer service from Amazon.com, as for the VersaFlex machine it is a definate must for anyone whom seeks added flexability in martial arts."
5,Versaflex is a joy to use!,"I am a dedicated martial artist that has been frustrated in my attempts to attain greater flexibility. Despite my previous instructor's claim that these types of machines are a waste of time & money, I decided to investigate the potential effectiveness of the ""Versaflex"". Based on this investigation, I purchased this machine & in the very short amount of time that I have used it, I am really happy. For me it makes stretching very relaxing & comfortable. I am very impressed!"
2,wears out fast,"Beware! Over time, mine wore out and the ratchet hook no longer holds on the gear teeth. It just suddenly pops free, and it can crush your fingers if they are in the way when it lets go. I have looked it over carefully and can't see anything that has come loose. It's just wear and tear, and it didn't have heavy use."
2,Latch won't catch.,So I've had this device for several weeks. After normal use now it won't lock your legs into position. The little catch wont hold the main gear so after you let go of the lever your legs just come back together. Piece of junk.
2,tough assembly,I only have a problem with the instructions for assembly. I am not sure If the assembly instructions were not included but what I was given was of little help. I am a mechanic so can follow instructions well but this was tough. All I was given was a full assembly instruction manual. It was very difficult to sort out and a few important things were missing. But the machine is good I just would never want to put it together again.
4,decent equipment,"Assembly was easy, just follow instructions. Works as advertised, streches legs. Pads on the knees could be a little longer for more support, to be better able to keep legs straight while stretching. Altogether, a good product, have had it 5 weeks with no problems."
4,Decent Machine,"I've been trying to do the splits for eight years and purchased this machine hoping to gain that last bit. It appears to be helping, and is easy and fun to use. The assembly mentioned in other reviews really is not bad. It has a few main parts and a bunch of nuts and bolts with pretty clear instructions. The construction seems sturdy. The machine allows you to zone out and relax while it supplies all the resistance. The only drawback is for taller folks, your feet will hang off the end causing your knees to rise. They should manufacture a version with longer leg supports."
3,Okay Product,"I found this machine to do the job it was intended to do. I didn't find that it was too difficult to put together and I thought the instructions were adequate. However, I would say I am very good at any type of assembly as a rule. As for complaints I was a little disappointed that the leg slats were so short. I'm 6' 3"" and this looks like it was designed for a child or very short person as my legs hit the end of the leg slats just below the knee/mid calf. Needless to say it leaves a significant portion of my leg hanging off which causes the knee to bend and the end of the board cut into the calf muscle. It would be better to design the slats with bolt holes in various places since for taller people having the board so close to the seat is not necessary but extending it out further is. The gauge is incorrect as well. At full extension it is 180 degrees but the pointer stops at 170 degrees."
4,Good buy,Cheap and vastly superior to a different battery I bought for $40 from a mall kiosk. Performance as promised and then some...
2,Not the perfect Tree book,"This is a beautiful book. There is no doubt that the photography is first rate. But it fails as a useful reference book to identify trees. The book tries to do too much. It wants to be a picture book. It wants to include most of the world's trees. Unfortunately, it does not do what I wanted which is to easily identify trees in our local parks and woodlands from the tree's general appearance and their leaves and flowers or bark. For example, many of the trees do not have photos or drawings of their leaves. Some only show a long distance view of the tree and nothing else. Trees that grow in Asia are next to trees that grow in the Northwest. There are many tree books. If you want a picture book, buy this book. If you want a simple and easy guide, shop around."
5,Great movie from the 70's,"I saw this movie a lot in college. If I will watch a ""tear jerker"" movie then it is good. It is a low budget film and you can definately tell the time period, 70's, but the meaning is great. It makes you think about your own walk with the Lord, in my case how easy I have it and am I living up to my potential."
5,I Love Justin!!!,"This book is amazing..its got everything for a Justin Lover and everyone-else !! Justin is the most amazing dancer, singer and soon to be heart-throb actor! He's gorge and is well know for his playful antics. Now he's dating Camaren Diaz...me jealous??...why would i be jealous?? No way....it cant last...can it ??"
1,Tears easily,"I bought this even after reading reviews complaining about how it tore when it was being put on the mattress. I was very careful putting it on to make sure it didn't tear. I thought I was successful. However, when changing the sheets and mattress pad I put over it later that week, I discovered that it had subsequently split right up the center of the bed. Since then, every time I change the sheets I find a new tear. This is just with regular use of the bed. I would NOT recommend this to anyone!"
2,okay,"This product was okay for us. It lasted about a year and kept our mattress dry when our toddlers crawled into bed with us and then peed themselves...and us. Our boys also jumped on our bed and the seams came apart and the zippers ripped off so really it was just like having a piece of plastic on the bed. It's also not very breathable so on a warm summer night, we were often too warm and sticky. We ended up putting a mattress pad on top of it and that helped the breathability ... but it's still not ideal. It'll definitely come off and never get back on as soon as our boys don't have accidents anymore."
1,Ordered two covers - two weeks later need to order more (from a different vendor),"We have had many vinyl covers over the years so I'm realistic that these things don't last forever....but I have never seen anything this cheap. I am so mad we wasted our money and that Amazon chooses to partner with a vendor that makes such a bad product. We ordered two for our King size matteress. The first lasted less than a week....split in the seam, by the zipper and new splits every day. I went to open the back-up one we had ordered and was so mad....it came out of the package with 8 rips!!!!!!! They were each over 2 inches in length. We still put it on as a protector until we could go back to the vendor we have always used in the past (and just for good measure it ripped at the center seam and at the zipper). DON't BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!"
3,Alternative solution for a Cover/Protector to store a mattress,"I read a ton of reviews based on this product and the feedback is always the same; tears easily and cheap zipper. However, in my case I just needed a protector/cover for mattress storage. This vinyl protector does the trick for those looking for a cheaper alternative to paying $60 bucks for a plastic cover from sleepys, Bed Bath and Beyond, Target etc."
2,not my favorite for accuracy,"had to replace it since it wasn't giving the correct temp and ended up with gooey lollipops - once I switched the thermometer to a digital one, back to businsess."
1,Terrible!!,"So I bought this for soapmaking, and I didn't realize the temperature only goes as low as 100. That's fine, that was my own fault. But the temperature is definitely off by at least 10 degrees. The clip on the side for holding the thermometer secure is cheap and does nothing. It's not sealed properly, so you get fogging inside and it gets so bad you can't even read what the temperature is. You can't even wash these by hand, because they fill with water! What a waste of money. Learn from my mistake!"
2,Did not hold up to the wintery blast,Unfortunately this winter the lock seized up a few times. I decided not to lock my gate during the winter since it takes a while for me to unfreeze the lock.
2,Terrible price for a great product,This salmon is quite good and normally reasonably priced in retail outlets. These cans cost $3.49 per can (individually) in the grocery store near where I live (Gristedes). The price quoted here is completely ridiculous!
2,rather disappointing!,"maybe it was just the hype that preceded this book (well, the author is editor of cosmo uk, so you do the math), but i just found it dull. for a whodunnit, it certainly wasn't pacy and it didn't hit any chick points, despite being about the fashion industry. i did finish it - just. i won't bother with any sequels, though."
4,Well done,"Nicely crafted, very well-written - extremely enjoyable. For anyone interested in Chinese (or Asian) historical fiction, this book is a very pleasant must read."
5,Covers the bases with a sense of humor,"This is an excellent introductory book. The cartoon-like illustrations are simple, clear, and often funny. The book covers all the topics any of the other good introductory guides cover, but the humor makes it fun to read rather than feeling like you're plowing through a dry text book."
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book. This book not only covers the various kayaking skills, it also provides lots of information on kayak design, selection, camping tips, tips on how to read tidal charts... etc. This is all done in a humorous, non-tedius way, which kept my interest a few hours until I finished it. Very useful information and I highly recommended it.My tip - read this book and watch a video (I used the Sea Kayaking: the ultimate Guide by Ken Whiting). The combination of the two complements each other quite well."
5,Sea Kayaking Illustrated: A Visual Guide to Better Paddling,This is the absolute best book on sea kayaking. It is very serious subject presented in an easy to understand humerous way. This is a must have for serious kayakers.
5,EXCELLENT,"FIRST OF ALL, SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH (I`M FROM MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY, SOUTH AMERICA). I WANT TO EXPRESS THAT ALL THIS PRODUCTS THAT I BOUGHT TO AMAZON, ARE VERY VERY USEFULL, VERY BEAUTIFULL, AND HAVE A GREAT AND PERFECT DESIGN. I`M VERY HAPPY WITH THEM AND I REALLY ENJOY USING THEM. THE LOOMS, USING WITH THE LOOM HOOK AND THE WEAVING LOOM TOOL, ALLOWS TO KNIT A LOT OF VERY PRETTY DESIGNS, ,EASILY AND QUICKLY, IN DIFERENT SIZES. I RECOMMEND YOU TO PROVE TO USE THESE PRODUCTS."
2,Meh.,"Do yourself a favor. If you are going to buy this, put a dab of superglue on the inside of the end without the hook. That way, the metal hook won't slide out, pop-out and lose forever that plastic cork, and eventually you won't stab yourself with the rough metal end, slicing your finger and forever ruining your mother's white cashmere scarf you're knitting."
4,loom hook tool,"This tool works very well for the the sock loom at the knittingboard, however the point is not smooth and round, and caused splitting of the thread, but other than that...it works well in the hand."
5,Very Helpful,It is very helpful tool. I use it for my innovations knitting machine to make my brim on a hat. I use it for my circular looms and socks looms.
1,Knifty Knitter Loom Hook,This hook is slow and cumbersome. I changed to a regular knitting to lift the stitches over and it worked much better.
3,Okay Hook,"I was hoping that this hook's handle would be bigger to make it a little easier to hold. It's way better than the wooden handle one to hold, but not very sharp. I'm still searching for a hook that I like."
4,Almost perfect,I would've Liked it so much better if it was princess cut instead of round. It's a beautiful ring and I wear everyday.
3,Great gem crappy band,Great gem crappy cheap band great for the price. Runs a little small. So size up a half or so.
2,Meh. Quality is lacking,"This ring has a ""diamond"" that is over sized for how light the actual ring is. Snags on things and the prongs are not sturdy at all. I also bought this other ring and it is way better: [...] Round Cut Cubic Zirconia CZ 925 Sterling Silver Solitaire Ring 0.84 Ct - Nickel Free Engagement Wedding Ring"
5,pennypincher,I LOVE this ring! I wear it with my wedding band that is platinum and everyone beleives it is real!
3,UGH,It was ok except for the fact there was a chip in the stone I was not happy with the result sorry
2,Looks so cheap!,Not like the pic! Band is very thin. Looks extremely cheap! Don't think of purchasing. Thinking of sending mine back.
2,Fake,"This ring is very fake looking. The Cubic Zirconia is not clear...I returned it. The size was true, the band is nice, but the rock is very fake looking."
1,Nooooooo,The 'diamond' is obviously fake. And sooo much bigger than in the picture. Cost wayyy to much for what its worth. So regret getting this ring.
5,Great Buy!,"This is a great product for a great price! My girlfriend (fiancee!!) didn't know it wasn't a real diamond - we agreed that CZ would be fine anyway as it's just a symbol, and she's worked in jewelry before and even she couldn't tell the difference!"
4,Sparkly,"This is a very pretty little ring. From a distance, it's very deceiving. The only thing is that it does have a slight (very slight) white tinge to it, which is actually kind of pretty. It's fooled a few people so far and you can't beat the price."
3,so-so,"in 2010 everyone should be using grade a cz's for these types of fake rings...... i have all kinds of fake cz jewelry and this ring obviously looks fake. there are some great grade a cz rings on ebay if you guys want something that truly sparkles like the real thing... i put this ring next to one of those and it doesn't even come close....... it's a nice little ring, but you can get better for less money.....if you know anything about diamonds this one obviously looks fake and is less brilliant than the picture shown"
4,simple and very real-looking,"I have to say that the reviewer who stated that the CZ was slanted in the setting was right -- it is! BUT, it is hard to tell unless one removes it from the finger and examines it closely. I am very happy with the ring. I have a real one exactly like this one but since I dropped it down the sink once and had to have a plumber retrieve it for me (paid the plumber $125), I decided to get a look-alike for daily wear. :) I am very happy with this ring and have been a loyal gem avenue customer since I purchased the first item from them in the summer! No disappointment yet so far (have purchased 5 times already). I've been wearing this ring since I bought it in September and my husband has not even noticed it (he thought I was wearing the real one)."
4,Excellent way to spend an afternoon,"Got the package pretty fast, in a couple days. The pieces are sturdy and the puzzle itself isn't hard, but the finished product looks great!"
2,Good but....,"Bought this for my husband who loves things like this. How ever... The pieces are easy to break, they don't fit all together and the little piece of sandpaper doesn't do much. Good idea my husband likes it but only for people who would take the time and don't get mad at a few pieces that should be fitting but don't."
1,Poor Quality!,"This item did not deliver none of the pieces worked and it requires an adult to cut and glue pieces. I thought it was for children who love puzzles. My 13 year old has put together several of these types of puzzles, this one was not quality. Customer Service seemed to be aware of the issue. They did refund so me being a fair customer tried another and the same thing happened."
2,glue and patience are a must,"The model is supposed to be interlocking, but due to the low cost of manufacture, the stamp-cut pieces are not precise enough to stay assembled with out glue. If you have lots of time and patience then the model can be built, but we felt that the time investment wasn't worth it and would not be reflected by the average quality of the model when finally completed. My 11 year old son and I quit after several afternoons of working on it."
4,good product with faulty connection,"im not the type to criticize people things that they put hard work into,but consumers should get valve for their money,this cable look good ,work good,but the red clamp just fell off ,when i examine it the connection just barely hitch on,this after 3 uses i tried to fix it but it were hard because the clip to hold down the cable to the clamp dont have any sturdy clip to hold it,to make it work i have to use a hammer to flattten a loop that the cable go thru to have any use but it seem it wont last very long,to the people who sell this look what u r sending to consumers properly.i paid $20 to ship it."
4,Good but on the expensive side.,"Works just as jumper cables do but I did think the price was a bit high. Other than that, Coleman is a great brand and the quality is great, you don't want to be stranded somewhere with no-name brand and have something short out."
3,Clips are not as much the same as depicted,Looking at the picture the clips have an extra part. (look at the clips on the right.) This was not present in the cables I had received. These Clips do not like to stay clipped to my bolts on my battery.
2,Shop before buying,"I ordered these for emergency purposes in my 3rd car. The cable is fine, but the clamps on each end are flimsy and I am not sure how well they will clamp to a side terminal battery, if at all. Since my Toyota used top terminals I decided to keep them and hope if I ever need a jump, they will also have top terminals available. Checked Walmart website after buying and they have similarly priced items, so consider looking at brick and mortar before purchasing these ""name brand"" cables."
3,Good framework...frustrating listen,"Brendan Benson's 'Alternative To Love' is sort of a frustrating listen, in that you can see the framework of great songwriting that never really materializes. Songs like 'Alternative to Love' and 'Feel Like Myself' start off sounding like they're going to be great songs, then they sort of wander off into monotony.There's solid enough pop craftsmanship to suggest Benson is ripe with talent, but result of this songwriting effort is unrewarding and banal. Really more accurate than a 3 is a 3.5 or so, but I just couldn't bring myself to round up to a four because so many of the songs sound like they could be made into great songs with just a slightly different approach to them. And the sometimes cringe-worthy lyrics clinched it as a 3."
3,Brendan Benson does it again...but not completely.,"This isn't Lapalco or One Mississippi, but it isn't horrible either. It was worth downloading illegally, but I don't think I would actually pay $20.00 for this CD...it simply isn't that good. A few songs are right on and remind me of the true Brendan Benson- ""Gold into Straw"" and ""What I'm Looking For"" whereas others dissappoint completely- ""Pledge"" (it's horrible!) and ""Biggest Fan"". Good job Brendan...but go back to those light tunes that were Lapalco!"
2,Very weak songwriting,"If you're going to take the path of power-pop solo act, you should first make sure you can write a compelling melody. ""What I'm looking for"" and ""the pledge"" are good songs, but not worth the price of admission."
4,Definately An Alternative...,"The main reason i bought this cd was because i had read that it was co-produced by Jack White of the White Stripes, and that Benson would soon be starting a side-band with White. Also because Benson had fans of the likes of Beck and Jack White. I was shocked to find out that Jack had nothing to do with this cd, but pleases altogether with what i was listening to.'Spit It Out' is definately the catchiest song but seems unlike anything else on the album. Other excellent accoustic offerings include 'Feel Like Myself' and the title track 'The Alternative To Love'.This cd does move into territory of power-pop status and for this reason is much more listenable. The lyrics are good, and clever on certain songs, and the instrumentation compliments the overall effect of the cd.Give it a go, you'll enjoy it."
1,"Disaster medicine, maybe not","Unfortunately this bok mainly details possible mechanisms of terrorist attack, some quite implausible. There is little detail on the morbidty from prior attacks, and even less on on disasters such as bushfires or tsunamis. I coudn't find a section on even epidemic control.there is a lot of opinion, most related to US organisational structures, little in the way of practical tips or facts.what have I done with it? I left it in Indonesia to save me from an excess baggage fee,; buy something else."
1,My legs were too short,"The machine seemed like gym quality, but it was uncomfortable to use and did not adjust to my height. I am 5 foot 3 inches and the machine was simply too long for someone like me. Also, even I, with a relatively small frame had to squeeze my legs into position due to limited space between the leg extension arm and base."
4,"my grandchildren loved the rhymes, fingerplays and illustrat","The fingerplays in Marc Browns collection are easy and well illustrated in this book. Traditional rhymes help children to feel confident in trying the fingerplays. The illustrations are also charming if you just feel like listening to the rhymes. They cause children to ask questions, think about the possible meaning of the rhymes and challenge their own imaginations."
3,Money better spent elsewhere,"The illustratons are frustratingly small. Alot of the finger movements were the same (1, then 2, then 3)."
5,Best Medical Tape for Sensitive Skin,"Paper tape is perhaps the most gentle tape on the skin, perfect for holding medical patches or gauze to the skin. It comes off more gently than other tapes."
3,"Good book, but uses too many obscure ways to access data","This is an above average book, but the author gives as much importance to VBSQL as it does to RDO and DAO and does not discuss ADO, the data access model of the future. Very little change from the 4th edition that talked about Visual Basic 4.0. Most of the material in this book will be outdated by the end of the year"
1,Don't waste your money on this.,"Just when you think he might give you some useful information, he blurts out some attempt at humor. I'm trying to learn access to SQL/Server from Visual Basic and he' trying to be funny. And by the way, where's the code! Be forewarned, this book has very little code examples of whatever it is Mr. Vaughn is trying to explain."
2,Smaller than it appears,"This is a inch book compressed into nearly 2 inches. Take out the author's chatty and ""colorful"" asides, and where's the beef?Maybe there's some good stuff on the CD-ROM. Nothing in the book led me to believe so, and I haven't looked.There are some interesting historical and business sidelights, however this does not compensate for the lack of solid technical information. The author is now a Microsoft employee, and has taught VB. I certainly would not pay Microsoft's prices for training of the same quality as this book."
4,Vaughn does it again,"Make sure you get the 6th Edition for the latest ADO stuff.Vaughn's practical approach continues to entertain and educate with his from-the-trenches perspective. You can tell that he's really sat at the keyboard and tried to do real development with VB6 and SQL Server.Not a tutorial or a complete reference, but chock full of technical nuggets, MS insight and practical advice."
3,good for the experienced programmer,"but it lacks many programming examples to the things that need more (working) explanations. I hope the sixth edition doesn't go so much into the history of VB and SQL. I really don't care how it came to be what it is today, just explain to me how it works right now."
5,Great Iifo but where is the beef?,"This book is chock full of everything you might ever want to know about VB & SQL Server. My major annoyance is that there are not enough code examples. Many times in the book Mr. Vaughn tells you that he knows how to do this and you can do this and that but he fails to provide example code and leaves you pretty much on your own to figure it out. The book would be much better if there were more practical solutions and less banter about his days at Microsoft. He also goes into too much history and evolution. Who cares how the Jet 2.0 used to do things? I want to know how to do things NOW. Perhaps this is very interesting to some folks but me, I buy books to get answers, practical solutions, ""How To"" scenarios. Mr. Vaughn just beats around the bush too much, and in many instances never illustrates the very thing most programmers want to know; where is the code?"
2,Seriously for beginners only,I was very disappointed with this book. I am a novice beader yet this book was below my expectations. It is my second book I purchased and I am selling it at a flea market. I must say I learned about the difference in tiger tail and flex wire and also how to crimp a bead properly - that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. That being said this book appears to have been written by an advanced novice. Unfortunately I want to learn from an expert. The book is full of projects but if you don't like to copy other people's work it is almost useless.
2,Definitely for Beginners Only,"I have not been beading for very long, but the projects in this book seem more for kids than adults. On the plus side, there is good information on tools and materials and instuctions are easy to follow with good photos. On the down side, of the 53 projects there are only 3 or 4 that I would actually make and a whole lot (30%+) that would appeal only to pre-teens. Factor in another 25-30% for ""home accents"" and ""accessories"" (candle decorations, napkin holders, etc.) and there isn't much left if you are interested, as I am, in jewelry."
2,Sophomoric At Best,"This movie strains too hard to be about ""adulthood"" and relationships. It has no depth because it is apparently too close to home for those involved (moore and her husband), and apparently they don't have the life experience to make anything that rises above all the silly cliches in this movie. Read the review by ""the most annoying movie I have"", he/she hits on the head. It is sad because of the talent involved, including moore. Even Billy Crudup fails to shine."
1,"Trust me man, this is not very good","The only reason why I watched ""Trust the Man"" is because the star of the film is David Duchovny (""The X-Files"", ""Return To Me"") I am not big on romance films, but since Duchovny's ""Return to Me"" was good, I thought I would give ""Trust the Man"" a shot. Not a good decision.""Trust the Man"" is about two men, Tom Pollack (Duchovny) and Tobey (Billy Crudup) and there struggling relationships.As I said earlier, i am not big into romance films, but I think I have seen enough good ones to know that ""Trust the Man"" is not very good."
3,"Lighten up folks, it's not that bad!","With all this talent in the mix, it would have been nice if this film had risen above mediocrity, but I still found it reasonably entertaining. There are a few laugh-out-loud scenes (my fave was Julianne Moore's passive-aggressive compliance with her husband's request that she narrate a porn video) and some clever theater references, and the rest is a string of bland and/or saccharine relationship cliches, but the cast is very attractive and I enjoyed the indie sound track."
1,Do not waste your time or money,"Attractive people, great NYC scenes and apartments, but none of that could save this horrible poorly written mess of lousy, immature male characters, bland and clueless female characters, and extremely childish bathroom jokes. I could not even watch 2/3 rds of it. Really bad."
3,Trust The Man,"As with The TV Set, the only reason for watching this movie is David Duchovny. He's always great to look at. He does his best with a stupid script. Again, his female costar, Julianne Moore, is much less physically attractive than he is. Of course, by now, anyone who reads these reviews knows that I'm partial to Tea Leoni and Gillian Anderson."
4,the Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla,The book is in excellent condition and it arrived in a timely manner. It is a great book for anyone interested in any engineering field. Great drawings and illistrations.
1,this book is...,i was given this book read it and was sad telling my best friend who understands my fascenation with tesla how bad this book is do not buy this book. if you have access to a collection of patents by tesla so much the better.
4,Scientific Curiosity,"This book is meant for the reader who himself possess some knowledge on electrical theory, mechanical ability and the desire to further his knowledge about Nikola Tesla's inventions. Even tough the book addresses some events about the scientist life the narrative is very concise with a quick overview on these occurrences which have been covered extensibly and in detail in other books about Nikola Tesla. I recommend this book to those readers interested in the classical turn of century approach to electrical devices and their applications. Diagrams, plans and the accompanying legends and information abound for those with this interest in mind."
2,Not Worth It,"With the amount of available recordings of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony out there, I would avoid this one. While I have heard countless interpretations of this masterpiece, I have never heard such a rushed and impatient rendition of the slow movement. Although the outer movements are not bad, they lack the texture and tone color necessary for this work. The Andante, which many musicologists credit with kicking off the Romantic Era of composition, is played so fast that it is impossible to appreciate. The beauty of art music is that it is open to interpretation. And yes, none of us knows how Beethoven himself envisioned the tempo. What we do know however, is that with all the energy in the outer movements of the Ninth, the slow movement can afford to be played at a tempo that allows the listener to ""smell the roses."" Stick with the Bernstein, Masur or even Karajan for this work."
2,not as good as reviews sugested,"I bought these for scanning areas for wildlife and then getting a closer view of what I found, but they do not seem to sit well when I hold them up to my eyes and the focus and lens quality on them is poor. I have had cheap zoom binoculors before and these are right down there with the worst. I also have a pair of bushnell 10x42 and these are not great but I have to say i prefer to use them. unfortunatly I do not have $500 for quality bins but these are not good and constantly need adjustments. Next time I would make sure I try the binoculors before I buy."
3,Quite Disappointed,"I was excited to see a recently published book on affiliate marketing, especially with the reputation of these authors, but once I started reading, I was quite disappointed. Though the book offers many useful websites as references and examples, for the most part I felt the book offered very little that was new in the affiliate marketing space and was actually a lot of common sense. I was also distracted by the poor editing job - numerous typos, several incorrect references, etc. If affiliate marketing is new to you, this book may be helpful. If you are somewhat of a vetern, there's very little worth your time."
2,Past It's Prime,"While there is some useful information in this book it is pretty outdated.When it was released in 2001 I believe it was the definitive work on the subject.However, now over 4 years later, most of the links to sites the book refer's to as resources you want to visit are now dead links.If it was updated, and brought up to date with live links for the same subjects, maybe.As is, a waste of time."
5,This is a definite MUST HAVE for any web site merchant!,"I only wish I would have read this book before I put my affiliate program together. This book is so crammed full of valuable information, resources, tips, and help. I took 4 pages worth of notes. This book is excellently written both for the merchant who is thinking about putting an affiliate program together as well as for someone with an existing successful affiliate program. I doubt that there is a more complete and thorough book on successful affliate managment. I would give this book 10 stars if I could!"
4,Radical dependence on the Saviour produces peace and growth,"This book is a marvelous witness to the peace and power available to us through the quiet welcoming of God into our lives each day. Carretto says, ""Deep down the soul has understood that it must let itself be carried, that it must abandon itself to its Saviour, that alone it can do nothing, that God can do everything.... What matters is to let God get on with it."" The author's lived-out, radical commitment is extraordinarily impressive."
2,Scribbler,"Far to much scribble and under marking, was not how it was advertised, i will be more cautious next timeGreg .. the book otherwise is OK excellent reading"
4,Couldn't Live Without My Smart Shopper,"Gotta have this paper since I couldn't life without my Smart Shopper, but it does seem a little pricey to me for a paper product."
5,Works as advertised,I received this product in a timely manner. These paper rolls work as good as the originals and they were easy to install. I will be ordering this item again when needed.
1,alright,"This item is alright., but since the voice recognition list organizer doesn't work, these items are useless to me, so then that is why my 1 star rating"
3,Paper Roll,"Product is fine, but somewhat pricey for paper rolls. The product is nothing special, but paper that fits into the SmartShopper."
5,SMART PAPER RECEIVED ON TIME IN EXCELLENT CONDITION,The item arrived much sooner than I expected and was exactly as advertised. I will definitely order from this vendor again.
1,Over a month later and still waiting,I order the Smart Shopper and the 3 refills and the Smart Shooper arrived withing a week yet the refills from True Value have STILL not arrived OVER a month later. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! :(
1,rip off!,The shipping on this product is beyond ridiculous!! Although the smartshopper is awesome the paper rolls cost way too much to ship!!! It costs three times as much to ship this VERY light product then the heavy electronic device! Rip OFF! Buyers beware!!!
2,Outrageous Shipping,The shipping costs was more than the product cost. Idid complain and they sent me $1.00
2,Jams in my Model of SmartShopper,"I got the Smartshopper when it first came out, and these rolls tend to jam near the end of the roll. I'm going to try to order directly through the Sharper Image link on Amazon and see if those work better."
5,Paper magic,"A three pack paper roll may not seem very exciting, but when you are used to talking your market list to the little machine that sits on the fridge, it is a major catastrophe when there's no paper to take down your breathless prose!Amazon delivered quickly and sent the right size! Paper was immediately placed in machine and dog was fed properly that evening."
5,Good solid information for those in career transition,"This is a great resource for so many who, because of the current economy, are in the midst of a career transition or career crisis. It is a fabulous resource that will help readers drill down to acknowledge their true passions and will give them the tools and encouragement to do what they are happiest doing. This book helped me take the leap to start my own business again after a business failure...and I am so happy that I did."
4,Nerf N Strike,"My grandaughter aged 10,and her brother, agd 7 (almost) love this toy. She got it for her b-day in June and is still playing with it."
2,Nice idea but broke quickly,"The missle works nicely and the single shot in fine, but the multi-shot worked great for about ten minutes, then stopped for good. Returned it for another unit. The second lasted about two weeks and then had the same problem. I think its in the garbage now."
3,Fun Idea But Poor Quality,"I just purchased this gun for my 10 year old son for Christmas. Within one day the hornet no longer worked. I took it back and exchanged for a new one. Within one hour the second one did not work. The other two guns work great but the hornet looses its seal so the air cannot be contained in the gun and dart shots are limp or it does not shoot at all. The DVD looked fun but we were never able to get it to play. Every time we clicked the ""Accept"" button it booted us out of the program. Very disappointing."
5,The triple blast launcher,"The N-Strike Unity Power system is a great tool for big nerf fights. The Scout ix3 blaster is great for tagging people in stealth situations, while the slightly larger Hornet A.S. blaster is the complete opposite. The Hornet A.S. is for the ""Front Lines"" as it's accuracy is limited but it's special feature to launch all of its' darts at once makes it too valuable to be left out in a battle. Last but of course not least the Titan A.S. ""Missile"" blaster shoots a huge nerf rocket that goes huge distances. Thank you for reading this report everyone!"
4,The King of Nerf Weaponry,"This is a very fun toy. One problem common to all toys like this is losing the little bullets. We haven't tried the DVD yet so I can't say how well that works. The missile launcher could do some damage so we've put a ban on that inside the house. It is quite an impressive weapon when all the pieces are put together. It takes a little while to get used to all the buttons but it's alot of fun once you do. I recommend this toy for any kid who likes any nerf style gun or bow and arrow sets. This is the king of ""nerf weaponry."""
5,one word:AWESOME!!!!!,"the nerf n-strike system has 3 guns.the scout, which is like a pistol, good for a sidearm in nerf wars but powerful enough to be considered a primary except for the fact that its not very intimidating and it only has 3 shots, the hornet, which is kinda like a nerf assault rifle, and the titan, which is the best because its fun to shoot stuff with a foam missile.all in all. a great purchase."
3,Better for Older Kids,"I'm surprised by the enthusiasm of the reviewers. I wonder if possibly they are teens, or parents of older kids. We got this for my son using the 8 and up age recommendations posted on the box. I feel that this toy is not appropriate at all for this age group. Particularly the middle sized gun (I believe it's the ""Hornet""). This thing shoots 8 little suction cup bullets at once with quite a bit of force. I accidently shot it in my house just trying to figure out how to work it. My husband and I were thankful no one was injured. One reviewer wrote that this toy would leave ""welts"" on your target...no doubt it would, but do you want your kids doing that to each other or their friends? We are worried that one of our children will be injured or we'll be sued by our neighbors. We are planning to return it or put it away until they are older."
1,Don't buy this gun. Launching power is very poor.,"I bought this gun for my 10 year old son for Christmas. The only gun that worked was the multiple dart blaster, however, that didn't work for very long. The missile launcher is very difficult to pump. You would think that after putting all your energy into pumping this gun, it would give a decent launch. I suggest you invest in a different nerf gun. I've seen much better."
4,Empressed,"I got this gun after my brother got one and we both love them!!!1)Can Shoot all guns with ONE hand2)Shoots a good distance3)If you can, get extra bullets cause they get lost easily4)Comes w/ combat DVD"
3,okay set-hornet blaster could be better,"this is an okay set. the scout gun has a good range,the missle is the best, but the hornet didnt fire well.some darts barely left the gun. i would buy this,once they lower the price."
3,I love Nerf guns,"The nerf n strike blaster is 3 guns in one.I love the bazooka it's rilly cool and you can never lose the dart to the bazooka it's giant,but I dont like the other two for two reasons one is because sometimes they dont fire,the other reason is that of you run with them the bullits fall out.so I don't recomend it if you want the pistle or the multy shot gun.If you want the bazooka I recomend it if your willing to spend alot.But I have fun with it even without the bulets for the pistle and the multy shot.But without the bullit for the bazooka it's boring!"
5,A great toy over all !!,"THE N-STRIKE IS THE ONE TO BUY! I GOT THIS FOR MY BIRTHDAY AND I DEFENENTLY WAS NOT DISOPONTED. THE FIRST GUN I TRIED WAS THE SCOUT (PISTOL) GOOD RANGE,OK ACCURECY,DECNT ROF (RATE OF FIRE)DEFENENENTLY A HOLDOUT WEAPON AND IN A NERF WAR IT'S VERY USEFUL .THEN I TRIED THE TITAN (ROCKET LAUNCHER)AWSOME RANGE , BAD ACCURECY ,HORIBLE RATE OF FIRE,ALOT LIKE THE ULTIMATER,BUT WHO NEEDS ACCURECY WHEN YOU CAN FIRE 60',THE BIG PROBLEM IS THE RATE OF FIRE. THEN I TRIED THE HORNET (SHOT GUN/SEMI-AUTOMATIC) GOOD RANGE (SAME AS THE SCOUT) DECENT ACCURECY, YOU CAN FIRE ALL SIX BY ONES OR FIRE SIX ALL OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME, ALOT LIKE THE BLAST FIRE. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WONDERING THE DVD IS GREAT BUT EASY TO BEAT THE GRAPHICS ARE GOOD TO."
5,Fun for the family!,"My daughter has always enjoyed the nerf line of guns. When I saw this one came with the interactive dvd I decided to get this for her. As it turns out my daughter, her father, and I all really enjoyed shooting the 3 guns which combine to make one large unit. While her father is shooting with the hornet she shoots the scout or vice versa, and they play as a team against the dvd. I personally like the mega-missile! It shoots for a long distance out in the yard. Really, this toy is a whole lot of fun, which is especially important considering how expensive it is.I highly recommend this for anyone between the ages of 8 - 108!!!"
3,"fun,pretty durable,and a little edacation involved!","This is a great toy.I don't own it but my friend has it.It is pretty durable,It is the most fun of just about anything(esept ventriloquisom,lol),its educational value is good because it uses handeye-cordnation.Buy this toy, and it will solve your problems for at least 2 years!"
1,The pump doesn't work for an hour,My son got it for Christmas gift. He only played it for less than an hour. The pump doesn't work any more. I went to the store for exchange but the new one had the same problem at the beginning. I had to go to the store again to get refund. It was fun when it works but not for long.
5,My son spent all his Christmas money on this toy.,"My son purchased this toy with his Christmas money. It seemed pricey considering it was just a Nerf gun. I was concerned that my son would be dissatisfied and regret spending all his money on one toy. However, he was certainly not disappointed. He has played with this toy often and is highly satisfied with the quality and components of the guns. Now, my husband wants one, too.The gun has several interlocking components that work together or may be used separately. It is pretty large, but my 9 year old has no problems holding it. It seems to have a lot of power and shoots a long distance."
5,N-Strike,"The new N-Strike is a great toy to play with friends. You can play with 1,2,or 3 players! that is the best part."
5,THIS GUN IS BEAST,This gun is awesome it has a great pistol the hornet is also good...but the Titan is BEAST it shoots up to 60 feet with great accuracy and power but when all three combined there is no way you will lose in a nerf war.
3,You can't be serious!,"The stories were good but they leave you hanging. ""Fair exchange, no robberies"" was the worst one. Very said and depressing ending. Why did it have to go down like that? There has got to be a contiuation. I also had to take away a star because the editing for the last two stories is poor. These little stories are only a tease but these girls have proved they can write though.3 1/2 stars"
5,That's What I Am Talking About!!!!!!!,"Tu-Shonda I knew you had it in you. I read your novel Flip Side and I just felt it needed more umphh to it well I guess you realized it too. Because then you came back in full force with The Last Run. I could just picture Bruh and his new wifey Zion. Lord have mercy.Fair Exchange, No Robberies by Danielle Santiago was another good read. I am hoping we the readers are going to find out if Lovi gets her revenge or not.Rollin' Dice by T.N. Baker was also a great story but this does not surprise me cause' T.N. has a great skill. See my sisters I only keeps it real and REAL RECOGNIZES REAL."
5,#1 fan,"For all of you guys that don't know Danielle Santiago or haven't read her books, you do not know what you are missing. The books are on fire and personally my favorites. The books are well written and keep your interest from beginning to end. So like I said go pick up Cream and Lil Ghetto girl a harlem story because you won't regret it. Five stars!!! Hey Danielle this is Mskiki from coast2coastreaders!"
4,techno without a flinch,"This album is straight techno from front to back. Some of it is repetitive, as techno tends to be, but in the right state it's fun to dance to. That is, of course, its purpose, and Percy X can meet such a goal. But once the goal is met, he takes a break. Track 5, ""Whatever When Ever,"" gets my best regards."
2,makes static sound,"the strings in this cajon makes static sounds, which is annoying... if that problem didn't exist, the base is nice and deep, so it'd be good."
1,"History of film, OK, but....","This film is Ok for the history of film, but as a 'great film', I supose it was great 100 years ago. Not worth your money unless your a fanitacial film buff."
5,amazingly beautiful and haunting,"Soaring, unearthly vocals and ethereal sounds are the essence of Rosewater's Faint. Melissa has a phenomenal voice and Jeremy is a brilliant composer. I had the good fortune in the `90's to see these geniuses live in Florida, their home state. If you gravitate to artists on the 4AD label (Dead Can Dance, Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil) you'll probably dig Rosewater. Jeremy's other music projects are Underwater and allegra gellar on Predator Friendly Records."
2,Carelessly cobbled together,"Text is marred by numerous errors, not just of spelling, but of dates, too. To wit: Foyot's was demolished in 1937, not 1933 (p.72). Cafe Voltaire was at #1, not 21, Place de l'Odeon (p. 67). Modigliani died 1920, not 1926 (p.121). Nathaniel West was killed 1940, not 1944 (p.120). Ezra Pound never lived in the rue de Seine (p.22). It is a fiction produced by Hemingway himself that he once rented an attic room at 39, rue Descartes, where Verlaine died (p.130). There's no such thing as rue St. Germain in Paris. It's 'boulevard' (p.20). And so on... Author also borrows/copies heavily, at times almost verbatim (but w/o acknowledgement) from Brian N. Morton's ""Americans in Paris"". Now there's a book to own!"
3,not quite,"had problems with this order. not sure if it was lost. it never came, however i was refunded in full."
3,Fast/hard/energetic yet unoriginal Gabber,"If you are a fan of Artcore (Gabber that uses drum & bass alot with fast (180bpm) & buzzy beats, just like the ruffneck stuff), then you will certainly enjoy the album. However I found that all the songs sounded the same and as a result the album got a little tiresome to listen to. The songs are exactly like the Omar Santana & Ruffneck stuff from around 1995 - 1997."
4,Who?,"Never heard of these crew before, someone had 'em on their Amazon list as some 'most slept on' underground dopeness so I scooped up the CD for under a dollar. Cheap. And you know what? It burns some of the more recent releases from big label backed artists.I think they're from Philly. Wherever they hail from, I dig the accents.You know how some Hip Hop tracks are just plain embarrassing in both their cheesy sound and lyrical content? These guys serve up something to be proud to be a fan of. I feel like giving myself a pat on the back just for listening, as well as mad props to these fellas for putting it together.If you like anything with an underground, indy, raw feel to it, you'll dig this.Wake up!"
3,Not good for Creative Zen,"I bought 2 of these for both of our cars. The MP3 player is supposed to slip into a clear plastic pouch. It would work for an IPOD, but my Creative Zen is too thick for this."
2,1943 Sea Tiger submarine.,"British submarine. an ok movie. but sound was bad. there crew were after a german battleship. ""brandenburg"" Not sure if they even got it. movie was very poor. fought there way through a mine field. and then I sub-net that they pushed through. was very funny to see. running low on oil. goes to denmark to take on some germans at port. of denmark land. and fighting their was best action of the movie. WE Dive At Dawn Was not a very good movie. stick with run silent run deep. was better.."
1,Keneng,"There was no sound with this movie, so I never even finished watching it. Thank you amazon. This is the third movie I have rented that had no sound."
5,We dive at dawn,Great! Liked looking at the technology and cultural interchanges (officers & other crew). Movie depicts well how the Captain keeps his professional distance inspite of such close quarters.
4,I can smell the sea,"I like British pictures and Royal navy.This film shows me how about inside ""H.M.S."".I am pleased to hear the ordres and answers.I found interesting to see subs entering seaport hoisting jory-roger if she made some ship sink and the other hand ,ships in port blow sirens.I like these ""seamanship""."
1,Learning Review,I have not received a copy of this book as of this time in writing. I don't know where it went. Can someone please investigate on my behalf. Thanks Mc Lawrence
1,Stay Away From This Book!,I have many books on this subject. This is by far the worst. It is more like a compilation of manufacturer's application notes for their ICs than a text book. He doesn't even cover off-line switchers!

5,Voluntarily Trumpeting the Purcell et al,"Purcrll's Trumpet Voluntary is possibly one of the most well known trumpet ""show-off"" pieces in the musical repetory and this disc is one of its best executions. To be noted, also, are the two offerings by Handel and J.s.Bach. Overall the effort is very well done."
3,go to the tortuga island,"un coffret de quatre films de pirates , pas ceux que je pensais acheter mais des films typique de l epoque que ce soit pour la realisation comme pour l image ; un bon prix pour 4 films de pirates qui donne une bonne idee sur le cinema de l epoque , les films sont tres bien encodes et l image est superbes c est un achat que je recommandei have buying this dvd for looking some pirates movies , i have a good surprise when i look this movies , all movies have a good image and a good sound, not renommed pirates movies but 4 good movies"
4,Good Old Pirate Movies,"This is a good collection of old ""swash buckling"" pirate movies! Cheap at the price. If you like old movies this is a good buy."
3,A decent collection,None of these are truly great but the price was good and I wanted to see a couple of them that I kind of remembered for back in the day so I took a chance. In this case it was all about the price.
3,"Gold Box for 23.27, normal (above ^^^) 7.79","This is the second time in two days that a film/set has been gold boxed at way more than it is sold for daily. I reviewed the previous one also, but not sure if review got posted. Something weird going on here....."
3,Colorful collection,"I was amazed about the fine quality of the films. Beautiful colors and beautiful people. Best was Errol Flynn's Against all flags, and the next best Double crossbones (because of its humor). The other two were not that good. The films, except perhaps Against all flags, were not expensive films, but they do succeed in giving the right atmosphere. This collection shows how much charisma Flynn had though not so young and brisk as in those great early films. Jeff Chandler is O.K., but here he must be so stiff that one does not like him very much. Of course, he will loosen in the end! - I am not sorry that I bought this collection."
2,Okay for the money,"Only one film, Against All Flags, was worth seeing. The inclusion of the Donald O'Connor film was a waste. There are better pirate films in the inventory."
1,Compilation of the Worst Pirate Movies Ever Made!,"I'm actually embarrassed that I ordered this. But if you are looking for an anthology of truly terrible pirate movies ( that doesn't include ""Cutthroat Island""), this may be for you!"
2,"Directing, photography and acting is below average","This set of Pirate films is a decent winter purchase when one cannot stand the rain and snow. However, though the actors are often top notch, these films were cranked out by the studio with little real monetary investment. I would buy it again, for I figured any Pirate film is usually at best average."
1,"Flynn at his worst, which could be remarkably bad","The best of these movies should have easily been Errol Flynn's starring role in Against All Flags. The problem is that no one got together to make this movie: the actors were all around, but not acting, and the storyline was incredible. This movie shines only because the rest on this disc are so bad that it makes ""All Flags"" look relatively good, when it assuredly isn't.Pirate movies are unlikely to be high art work, but this is struggling to reach the bottom of the pile"
1,Deceiving picture ads. Not worth the price.,Real item is NOT what is shown in the picture. Very deceiving. Not worth the price. Read product description carefully. A costly mistake for me.
2,Don't trust the product picture,"...be careful, the product picture, wrongly shows 5 cymbals, the pack has only two! Read very carefuly the product description."
3,"Well, Its good but not the best","These sound Great for a beginner, but not a sound a regular drummer would like, a little over-priced also. I believe the sabian B8 pros are much better."
4,air compressor,I have had this compressor for a little over a year now and it seams to operate fine. The instructions for installation are in my opinion vague. If you have never installed a big machine take your time. It is quite top heavy and you will need 2 people to manuver it around. I put isolation feet at the mounting legs and it does help considerably with vibration isolation. A booklet should be included with the compressor showing different airline hookups and hardware required. Overall a decent machine.
1,Ingersoll Rand Air Compressor Model# 2340L5,"Ingersoll Rand Air Compressors are not what they used to be. I purchased this compressor, brand new 11 months ago for home use (April 2011). It powers a tire machine, and a few air tools for approx. 8 hours use per month. After 40 hours, the valves went in the first stage head. After 11 months, the pressure switch went, and the oil started leaking from two head bolts on the first stage head. If I would have known Ingersoll Rand Air Compressors had this poor of quality, I would have purchased something else."
4,Canyon Passage,"Bought the Classic Western Round-Up, specifically for the notable movie Canyon Passage for a variety of reasons, including the scenic views of central Oregon (Bend, Sister area in 1945). I was very much pleased with the cinema-photography, the acting, and other aspects of the film. If you liked the movie ""Bend in the River"" (1951), shot on Mt Hood, you'll like Canyon Passage."
4,Non-shoot-out Movie About the West,"Fine picture of mostly non-violent pioneers in the Pacific Northwest. A loyal rendering of Ernest Haycox's novel. Dana Andrews stalwart as Logan, the shopkeeper, Susan Hayward as sweet and loyal Lucy, Brian Aherne as Lucy's fiancee, with a problem with gambling. Hoagy Carmichael is a townsman, who introduced his theme song ""Old Buttermilk Sky,"" Lloyd Bridges a gold prospector, Ward Bond a sweaty ruffian. One for kids to see it wasn't all saloons and gunmen who settled the West."
5,western roundup,"This is one of those movies you want to see over and over.The Texas Rangers is one of those movie that was made over call The Streets of Lorado with William Holden thats no longer available/Kansas Raiders is Audie Murphy at his best.I also was suprise to see Tony Curtis in a western, A must see movie for all western fans.Audie Murphy has another very good movie call Seven Ways from Sundown with Barry Sullivan that is no longer available/The lawless Breed very good story line a must see all classics."
2,"Great scenery, flimsy plot","Director Jacques Tourneur is probably most fanous for ""Cat People"" and ""Out of the Past,"" with most of his other work ranging from mediocre to downright B-movie making. ""Canyon Passage"" is a fairly sluggish western set on Oregon, whose natural beauty is the real star of this film. The 1946 Technicolor process is astoundingly rich and most of the movie is filmed outside, against mountains, lakes, forests, meadows, and farmland. The story is flimsy, involving hionest-to-a-fault Dana Andrews taking care of wastrel Brian Donleavy because Andrews harbors a distant love for Donleavy's fiancee, Susan Hayworth. There is a very violent fistfight in a bar, precursor to the famous one in ""Shane,"" and the Indians' burning of settlers homes is terrifying. Beyond that no one distinguishes himself, least of all Hogey Carmichael who seems to have composed the ditties he sings on the spot (the exception being the tag at the end, ""Old Buttermilk Sky."""
3,"Okay, but not great.","The part that's supposed to curl, doesn't. It's not long enough, so hair gets caught in the crevices & pulls out. Works okay for straightening, otherwise. I have really curly, thin hair & it straightens quickly on high heat."
1,Not enough heat,"I bought this because of the curved plates, but I had absolutely no luck with this. My hair is pretty short, mostly straight, and generally takes well to straightening, but this did no good. I used the highest heat and made sure to apply firm pressure and went over the same areas multiple times. Still nothing. Not only would the ends not flip, but it didn't even work as a regular straightener. I ended up going back to my old flat iron and I'm going to try to return this one."
1,NO WAY!!,"Absolutely horrible, this was my second hair straightener and it did NOTHING! It didn't even get hot and the ""v"" shape that it has to supposedly reach the roots didn't straighten the roots at all!! plus when you try to clamp it down to your hair there's no where for your fingers to rest to protect you from burning your fingers. So save your money and purchase a straighter worth while. I have permed hair and this may have made a difference but i still would not reccomend this to ANYONE! it really deserves a 0!"
3,good hole saw for the price,We have used these alongside the Lenox carbide tipped hole cutters and the Bahco work just as well and cost a lot less. The carbide teeth do not dull as fast as the bi-metal when cutting abrasive materials like Hardie board or drywall or plaster or fiberglass. Not any better than bi-metal for cutting wood or particle board but then those uses are not recommended by the manufacturers in the first place. For wood with nails the bi-metal are better hole saws and for wood and particle board the TCT hole cutters work better.
5,Makes faucet repair much easier,This is the first faucet repair I have made having this tool. The O rings were so much easier to remove and replace with this tool. Before I had rigged up a tool with a coat hanger or paper clip to get the O rings off and it was a mess. I highly recommend this tool.
2,"Big enough box, but...","I bought this box so I could transport my bikes overseas. This box is big enough that I can haul either of my bikes with no problems. However it is not worth the price.I have to use extreme care when packing my road bicycle so it will not recieve any damage. The sides of the box are not strong at all. If there is any kind of side load the box WILL break. The inside frame has only ONE support for the tires and WILL bend my road bicycle wheels.I still have to take everything (seat,handlebars,rear derailer,etc..)off to get the box to close. So I still have to use extra padding and supports in the box when moving my carbon frame road bicycle and just padding on my steal frame mountian bike.Bottom line I could buy a box of the same quality and inside framing for half the price. This box is NOT worth it unless you REALLY REALLY want it."
4,Memories,"The memories this CD bring back of the whole trilogy are just startling. They only thing this CD is missing is Brucia la Terra (aka Anthonys song, or My earth is burning). That song does not appear on any of the other cd's, unfortunatly, but for all you Godfather lovers, just buy the cd, for it will make you feel like you were watching the movie."
5,This CD is an offer you can't refuse.,"This CD is real first class stuff. However, I was more then disappointed that it did not have song Brucia la Terra. I was looking for that song ever since I heard it in the movie."
1,Worst Choice of Music from a Movie,"The Godfather III was a good movie, it had great music, especially one song Brucia La Terra, that Michael's son sang to him in the party before he made his appearance in the Opera, of course someone in their crazy choices left this most beautiful of songs of Sicily out of the CD....W H Y ?????"
4,it s very good .,"it s very good .. was my 1st time and there were very responsable , so i m happy . best regards !!!"
4,Keeping the spirit,"This soudtrack send us to the spirit of the two previous ""Godfather ""movies . Nothing new or surprising , but a beautiful revisit of old Italia music."
3,If youre in the mood...,"If you have seen the movie more than 500 times its all a bit predictable. If you have not then some of the content is worthy of a listen. There are some fantastically moody tracks that will carry you out of your living room and into Sicilie. And of course there is some trash too.The excerpts from the opera Cavalleria Rusticana are, by a long way, the highlights of the album.It helps if your hi fi system can get into the mood of things as some of these pieces need more oomph than a mini or midi system. If in doubt add volume.Enjoy with tomato pasta, red wine, a green salad, a rainy night and one other person. Then it will all fit together very nicely. Otherwise its all a bit, well, corny."
1,Returned unsatisfied,The bra was not true to size. I emailed the company and never received a response. Will not order from them again.
1,Disappointing,"I recently received my copy. There are NO ""Exclusive special offers and discounts for our readers"" as promised in their advertising. This is why I ordered the book.Otherwise it is a list of inns and B&B's that has too little information presented to make an informed choice of where one would want to stay.Save your money if you are looking for discounts. There are a number of very good websites that provide information one may use to make a choice."
1,Poor Guide,"The plethora of inns claimed are mostly name, address and phone number. I can look in the phone book for free, thank you. Of those featured, there just isn't enough information to make an informed decision. Save your money. There are better guides available."
