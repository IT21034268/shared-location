5,Great durable toy to keep pups busy and entertained,"I purchased this because of my great experience with the Busy Buddy Tug. My two Springer Spaniel puppies and my 11 yr old Lab all love this toy! They shake it around, it is safe for them to chew on, does come apart and I fill it with kibbles of food and small pieces of treats. Some treats fall out when they shake it and then they work on trying to get the rest out. It has proven to be durable, hours of entertainment and I feel comfortable leaving it in their kennels with them when I am not home .. no fear of anything breaking off for them to choke on. Wrigley carries it around with him every place! I am buying two more for the other two dogs!"
2,what does it do???,"My Corgi has no idea what to do with this toy. Perhaps because he doesn't shake his toys, the food has been in the toy for a very long time. I put his favorite dried meat treats but it didn't help. He is very food driven but this toy gets a big yawn. I have fostered several other Corgis and none of them could get food out either. I removed many of the little prongs but it did no good. The dogs chew the toy sometimes so I gave it a 2 as a fairly expensive chew toy.The dogs love Tricky Treat and Buster Cube but this toy has been a bust."
2,Not one of Premier's better toys,"My dog absolutely adores a number of Premier toys (the Busy Buddy and Jack in particular), but this one was a dud."
5,Dogs need to have fun too!,"My dog loves this toy, It is a great way to keep himself busy, when we have to leave him alone.Durable and easy to clean. Every dog should have one!"
3,Isabella is unsure about this one,"Izzy hasn't really played with this as much as I thought she would. I think it's neat and it makes a fun noise when it bounces on the floor. She doesn't seem very interested though, even when I put kibble inside. She's teething (4 months old) and I would think she'd like to chew on the rubber. But so far, she's prefered other items. We'll keep working on it though..."
3,not my dog's favorite,"functions OK as treat dispenser, but my dog doesn't really play with it much or even try to get treats out very often (even when it has his favorite treats in it)."
4,puppy fun,"We have a 15lb mini schnauzer 4 month old puppy. It is soft rubber so it is nice on his teeth and easy for him to grab and chew. The size is perfect for him. His puppy food doesn't stay in very long despite the ""prongs"" and comes out easily during play so if you want to make it a true brain challenge for your dog you would need to purchase larger sized treats; however, our dog really enjoys it as is with his small dog puppy food sprinkling out."
2,Didn't appeal to either of my dogs,Neither my German Shepherd or my Texas Blue Lacy cared for this toy. It sat in the toy basket.
1,Lasted less than fifteen minutes!,"My dog destroyed the soft flexible middle in short order... Notnearly as good as ""Squirrel Dude"" or ""Chuckle"" by Premier, bothof which seem indestructilbe."
2,Not tough enough,My 25-lb Tibetan Terrier had this toy in two parts after less than 24 hours. It's a shame they couldn't make exactly this design out of something as tough a Nylabone. The treat dispenser ball on either end is very well designed to capture interest. But I was very disappointed that he chewed into two separate pieces that quickly.
1,Not Durable,"I purchased the Med/Large version rated for strong chewers according to the product label. It lasted all of 4 hours with my 55lbs Hound. The rubber is much too soft for strong chewers- esp. in comparison to The Chuckle, made by the same company, or Kong branded rubber toys, which have held up just fine with my dog. Save your money and get a different product that will last."
4,"Pretty fun, but has a few issues","Overall this toy is super fun. I like the mechanical portion and it works well. The toy works as advertised. The only issue I have is with construction. I pinched my hands several times trying to put together the twisting ramps. It also required a lot of leverage on my part to connect everything. Just be careful when assembling. The toy comes apart for transport very easily, though! Be careful: Don't bend the plastic parts by force. This is easy to do, but if you are patient it will work out. My son is 7 and enjoys this toy a great deal."
5,The Most Comfortable Dress Shoe,"These shoes were worn to two weddings - not only because they are very classy and go with almost every color, but because they are super comfortable. After dancing and standing around for hours, my feet weren't even tired! That's a huge thing to say about any pair of dressy high heels."
1,"Gross, far out , and a stupid and predictable theme",I would like to report that this was one of the worst books I have ever read. Who murdered who? How did the other party die? It was clearly the work of an amuture! I think there should have been more action and a better explanation of the reason for Catherine's demise.
3,kept me interested but not one of the best,"i love R. L. Stine but this book was a little lacking. it was a little strange and somewhat unbelievable. i know that Stine is a much better writter than this book shows but i guess that it just wasn't much in my taste. all in all it was still worth the couple hours that it took to read. this is more of a book that i would recomend checking out of the library instead of buying though. not to offend, but i think it would be better if you were younger not because being young means being stupid but that you have a better imagination and things are more believable. This would be really scarry for someone about 10 or maybe 11. I'm too old to be reading Fear Street books but still like them. So shoot me!"
4,Good theory,It gives mostly theoretical coverage. Some practical aspects are missing. It briefly covers amplified receivers which should have be given more attention. Good for receiver designer and not so useful for receiver users
2,Didn't like,"I did not have the good experience with this product that the other reviewer had. I couldn't get my ipod onto the dock without taking the case off. And the case if very difficult to put on and take off, because of the ""skin-tight"" rubber material that doesnt stretch very well. Very disappointed, bit it did look cute and protect OK while it was on."
1,If there were negative stars I'd award them to this book,After reading this book I have the distinct impression that the authors a) have never worked in an office\corporate environment and b) have not used an email system developed later than the 1970s....They seem to believe that email in the corporate environment has taken over from letters - instead of memos - who can ever remember a memo that started or ended with personalised messages...? Certainly emails written for customers ie people external to the organisation require this but intra-departmental? To a peer? get real...Just to be really irritating you could save your money and read just the first page (a top 10 list) and have covered off the entire book - which simply repeats each of the items in the list.If you want a really good book on the subject then E Writing by Dianna Booher is a far better option! She covers the same situations PLUS A LOT MORE...
5,The Great Email Bible!,"""Office Emails That Really Click"" is an incredibly useful reference tool that should be next to everyone's computer! Maureen and Sandy offer expert advice about the do's and do not's regarding email etiquette in a very user-friendly and witty format.They also provide great tips on grammatical errors that we all frequently commit and clear up common misconceptions. Thanks for the English lessons!Go buy this book!"
5,This is the Best Book on Emails in a Business Setting,This is a book that should be read by all junior staff and recent graduates.There are two ways to send emails. One is to your friends and with text messaging and the other is in a business setting where you are respresenting your company.This book gives sample emails and grammar tips too.I loved it and will buy it for my entire staff. Hopefully they willstop using all lower case with everything.
1,wrong item,"Bought the Meguiars last touch 5G and instead got the 1g, on amazon it clearly states 45lbs but they ship me an 11lb package, but as you can see now they made some changes. total rip-off, and waste of my time. Autogeek blamed amazon for the overriding their description. bad business to everyone."
1,Seam came apart when I wore it the first time,"The vest is lightweight, but unfortunately not well made. The seam next to the strap came apart the first time I wore it. I sent it back. Now I have to spend time finding another one. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,It's OK for the Price,I would pay more for a bit more heavier duty construction. One seam has pulled loose after fairly light use of walking our dogs before or after daylight for a half hour about different 20 times.
2,Not what I was expecting,"When I ordered this vest, sizes small and large were specified. I ordered one of each size. When I received them, it was clear to see that they were the same size...BIG. Iam about 5'4 and I could wrap this vest around myself one and a half times. I mean Big. The elastic sides didnt help the matter. So while I bought these vests to make me and my riding buddy more visible while riding our horses in traffic, I think the sheer amount of fabric might pose more of a hazard by spooking our horses. So for the cheap price I will cut them down and re-sew them to fit, but certainly not what I was expecting."
3,Wish it was longer...,"It's not clear from the picture, but this vest is short. I'm 6 feet tall and it only comes down to about my navel. So, I feel a little silly wearing it, it looks like it was made for a little kid even though it is plenty big enough around to fit me. But my bigger issue with the shortness is when I wear it for bike commuting, my backpack completely covers it in the rear so that it does not provide me the visibility I would have liked. A longer vest would extend below my backpack and work better for me.Other than that, I agree with the positive comments of the other reviewers about its visibility, ease of use, and light weight."
1,Worthless and disposable!,I have never encountered a product so unsuitable for any use. This thing shredded after the first wear! It's a single use product. Definitely spend a little more money for something that will actually last! It's like a paper towel!
2,Cheap but still overpriced,"This is not good for cyclists. Unless you're a large-framed person, the vest will flap around behind you like a cap until you shorten the length of the flexible straps to the side. This is what I had to do. I used binder clips, and the material is so cheap and poorly made that it tore the very first ride after I had put the clips on.BUYER BEWARE: THIS IS EXTREMELY CHEAP QUALITY MERCHANDISEI feel that even for 3 bucks this is overpriced (note that the seller charges a whopping 7$ for shipping on an item that weights less than 4 ounces. This should be no more than 3$ shipping & Handling, and the product itself is worth maybe 2 bucks.If you buy this for bicycling, don't expect it to last longer than a month or two of regular use."
5,Used for biking,"This is a simple, bright, reflective vest. This is a full vest - full front and full back with a velcro closure in the front. The front and back are connected under the arm with a small cord on each side.As far as comfort, I don't notice it at all. It's a non-issue.I added thePlanet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Lightand thePlanet Bike Blinky ""7"" 7-Led Rear Bicycle Lightto my bike for even more visibility."
5,My Intro to Zephyr,"Back in the early 70's when I was in graduate school at Southwest Missouri State in Springfield, a friend of a friend turned me on to the sound of Zephyr. I bought the vinyl and just before wearing it out, recorded it to tape. Alas, with the vinyl worn out and the tape hopelessly missing, I thought for sure Zephyr's ""Sunset Ride"" had, well, ridin'into the sunset. I have looked for years, in every music store I have entered, for this album, and now, with the possibility of finding it again, I am joyful. With the music and production so solid, the songs so good from top to bottom (a great version of ""High Flyin' Bird""), the musicianship absolutely first rate, it has always surprised me that the band didn't catch on ... oh yea, disco happened. Get this CD!"
5,Zephyr(less) Bolin,"The band Zephyr played for years in local clubs in Colorado. The prominent guitar work of then lesser known Tommy Bolin, usually stole the show. Although, all of the members of Zephyr could hold there own when it came to performing. I did not care for any of the records that were done(Going Back to Colorado, Zephyr ) as they seem to lack any of the Zeal that was present during live performances, maybe poor mastering, they were Ok for what it is worth.The record Sunset Ride is a superb recording and it was done after the departure of Tommy Bolin to the band Energy. Sunset Ride clearly showcases the excellent flowing vocal talents of Candy Givens without her trying to top Tommy's guitar playing, and the excellent song writing of Candy and her brother David. The instrumental contributions for this record are also outstanding, though much of the cast had changed this is well worth having in any collection."
1,sunset ride by zephyr,"after listening to this cd several times i can't sayanything good.usually when there is this much positivefeedback i can find something good in the music.theoverall sound is horrible and the bass is over boosted.as for the music, they sound like an average bar band."
4,SAAB 900,Book is informative and descriptive. I was able to pinpoint problems and shown how to replace parts. This book was well written and the photographs are very helpful with diagnosis.
3,Book RTeview,"I was hoping for a more detailed book, which this is not, but what it does cover is very helpful."
5,its a book.,"It's hardcover, thorough, and what I was looking for. It wasn't damaged. a good product."
1,Doesn't cover all models,The manual excludes the 2.5 V6 included in many Saabs 1995 thru 1998.There is distinct lack of a comprehensive wiring diagram. It even lacks any information on power seats. Very poor manual. Please save your money and don't purchase. Unless you can live with these shortcomings.Thank You
1,worst manual ever,"I have used Haynes manuals for my GM vehicles and they had plenty of information. This is the most incomplete manual I have ever owned. It made no mention of a critical part I needed, the IAC valve. I have yet to find an adequate replacementy manual."
1,They switched heading,"Click on ""Other products by Equator"" and read reviews for same machine under different heading."
2,Not worth much,"On the first day of the two-week trial the blog I got had articles dated 2 months ago. In the next 8 days I didn't get anything, then suddenly I got 1 or 2 articles on each of the next 5 days. Maybe the blogger was on a long vacation. The articles that came in were pretty good, well-written and informative. But, since there were only 1 or 2 articles per day, I can't recommend this blog when you get 20 articles per day in the blog Physorg- Health and Medicine."
4,Teaching Tolerance,"I hope this book goes back in print because it is a good book to teach tolerance of cultural differences. The Araboolies are a colorful people who like to have fun. Yes they do shake up the neighborhood and push limits of conservative decorum, but they represent the change in our communities to more multicultural neighbors. Fun illustrations and a good story!"
5,A brilliant fun-filled lesson in tolerance.,I recently had the opportunity to hear Sam Swope read his book to a room full of children and their parents and everyone loved it! This thoughtful book should be required reading in every grammer school in America. Mr. Swope proves that teaching tolerance can be fun!
3,did his homework,"Mr Spoede has written an interesting book, which actuarately portrays conditions in Germany during the war. His premise is believable. A good read."
5,Nice and Easy,"The ELITE EL-503 Hi-Boy TV Stand & Mini A/V Center, is a wonderful product. All of the pre-fab parts fit together perfectly and was easy to put together. The product is quality and is attractive. It is also very stable. Get it!"
3,Cute but destined to be a bargain table book.....,"I was excited when I saw this book, I was hoping for a comprehensive guide to the history of the chicken, my favorite land animal. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice book great pictures, great vintage art but in no way complete. Great for someone who has a slight interest in chickens, or loves country."
2,"Okay if you want pencil and paper games, but not alot of fun","This book provides you with four pencil and paper games and they have duplicate copies provided for you, but they aren't very inventive. If I would have known what this book had, I would not have purchased it."
5,Measuring Jerusalem - The Palestine Exploration Fund...,"Measuring Jerusalem is a well researched and documented book which gives an excellent view into a(as yet) little known period in the history of Palestine, and the British role therein. The 19th century ""opening"" of Palestine and European conflicting interests (especially British) are the main focus of the book. Details of the ""Imperialist"" aims and manipulations are combined with the descriptions of the adventures of the intrepid explorers (many of whom played a dual role as explorer and spy). I especially enjoyed the personal stories of the explorers themselves and their adventures in Palestine (such men as Sir Charles Warren, Lord Horatio Herbert Kitchener, James Finn, T.E.Lawrence are talked about). I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Palestine, it's history, it's exploration and it's role in 19th century Imperialism."
5,Spritual growth by proxy,"While I cannot practically take long stretches of time off for spiritual growth (yet) nor study with a Zen master, I can carefully contemplate Jane's experience and vicariously enjoy and learn from Jane's discipline, insight, and perceived weaknesses. Her voice, always authentic and clear, is a welcome change from the emphasis on appearance and persuasion that is common in ordinary life. Her story motivated me to someday attemt a similar journey of spiritual discovery."
4,Great Purchase,"Just got these and watched the episodes. Yeah the new animation stands out a bit, but you can overlook that pretty easily. It is really nice to have the series in a format where I can watch a saga in a night instead of a week. Only thing that was disappointing was the 4:3 image, but that's how it was made, oh well. Highly recommended if you love the show but don't want to invest half of your life re-watching."
4,Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part One (Blu-ray) Review,"Dragon Ball Z is one of my all-time favorite anime, and Dragon Ball Kai is even better. Kai is the same as Z, but it's much shorter because a lot of the ""filler"" episodes have been removed. Thus, it's more closely related to the manga now. With that said, you do miss out on some character's back stories. The overall story is paced a lot better, though, and there is a consistent amount of action.Overall, Part One is a decent Blu-ray release. The animation looks great and the audio is superb. There's really no extras and only 13 episodes are in Part One. Also, the episodes are still in a 4:3 format; they are not widescreen (16:9). This is worth you money if you can get it for under $20. Funimation knows how to milk a franchise with some of its releases, and sadly, this is one of them."
1,Cashing in one the MILK-COW machine,"This series was advertised as a REMASTERED-HD version of the DBZ series. I'll tell you what it really is. Kai is DBZ - minus all the fillers - in standard SD. Nothing HD about it. The rereleases in the orange boxes (also the Dragon Boxes) were better than this Blu-Ray set. SKIP - BY all means, skip. Unless you don't have the series - or would like to completely watch the entire saga of DBZ - in SD."
2,No 16:9 HD? WTF,Stick with the already widescreen remasters of the anime itself. This is not in widescreen which is a dealbreaker on a blu ray purchase.
2,Dragonball Z Recreation,"In my own opinion, I think this is redicules. Re-editing/recreating the Dragonball Z series is just down grading the popularity. No one is going to buy it. I grew up watching Drangball and Dragonball Z, and they were great at there peek, but not anymore. By recreating a previous sereis is jusy making it worse. Funimation needs to just leave it be."
2,Horrible,"I have watched Dragon Ball Z for a decade and after watching this it makes me feel like its not even Dragon ball Z. They have changed everything, they ruined it by replacing a lot of the main characters voices and not even putting in the English music. The only good thing about this is the fillers being taken out, would have been perfect if they kept the voice actors and the english music."
3,Beware of cursing!,"I bought this for my son for his birthday because he watches this series on Nicktoons. Well, much to my surprise...and displeasure....there is cursing in it. I guess Nicktoons must edit it out because there has never been any cursing in what is shown on their channel. Since there is no rating listed, I had no warning prior to purchase. It's only fair to let people know what's included, so for anybody that wants to know about it, this review is for you."
3,Not What I Thought It Was,"I bought this as a Xmas gift for my 10y/o grandson, who watches the cartoon seris on TV. This was not the same format, same characters but on an adult level with strong language. I will check the details better next time,I don't recall reading that it was not suited for kids, otherwise great service, perfect condition and price."
2,This is garbage and a waist of money,"All I have to say is get the dragon box sets, because this is a watered down version of dragon ball z. Some of the voice acters didn't come back to dub there voice for this version. In some sceens the color is faded and washed out. I saw a freeze sage episode and the voice for freeza is different :( disapointing. I hate the annoying black bars on both sides of the screen.I highly recommend just getting the DRAGON BOX volumes. They did a excellent job remastering frame by frame every episode of dragon ball z to its origanal frame size and color. the picture is clear and beautiful as well."
2,Overpriced into oblivion.,"I fully support trimming the fat off of the bloated DBZ series. The filler was annoying and since it wasn't written by Toriyama, it wasn't true to the characters or the tone of the series.My complaint rests with Funimation's handling of the release. Once again they rip the fans off by splitting the 4 Sagas (Saiyan, Frieza, Cell, Buu) into completely unnecessary ""seasons"". 13 episodes for 35 dollars? That's 400 dollars(EDIT -- Turns out they're shooting for 100 episodes, not 150.) for a shortened version of a 20 year old show. This is definitely the most overpriced DVD set I've ever seen. I could understand them selling each Saga for 40 bucks each. 160 dollars is reasonable for such a long show, regardless of age. But 400 dollars is infinitely unreasonable.I feel like they're holding my childhood hostage! Just let me watch DBZ without selling a kidney! I'm begging you, Funimation!"
1,Is George Lucas co-owner of the dbz franchise now?,"They are just quadruple dipping us at this point. This is Star Wars and LOTR all over again. They package this box 100 different ways and sell it as new each time. I have been buying dbz since VHS. They just released the remastered DVDs a couple of years ago, just to do another paste job blu-ray release, and in another year they will release the boxed sets again but on blu-ray. This is just getting stupid. They released this version first because it has less special features and zero dialogue. It is just dbz action sequences non stop, which is kind of cool, but why not give people the option? Are we so lazy that the ""next scene"" button is too much work for us? This series was great back in the day, but how many different boxed sets need to be bought? Evolve. Go buy some other good anime for the FIRST time instead of buying this for the tenth. It's been 20 years guys, and there is a lot of great anime alive today."
1,"COMPLETELY ALL CHEAP TRASH,SO NOT WORTH BUYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","HI,i looked at the advertisment videos for a couple dvds in the series and let me tell you all i see is a poorly made production series!!!Its nothing more than a (CHEAP KNOCKOFF) of the original series people worldwide already enjoy!!!Its really just not worth buying,hell i wouldn't even waste time checking it out!!!DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T WASTE YOUR GOOD MONEY ON A WORTHLESS PEICE OF RUBISH SUCH AS THIS,Thank you."
5,Awesome!,Dragon Ball Z Kai cuts out all of the filler that doubled the length of the manga's story. Buy this if you want Dragon Ball Z filler-free.
3,Confusing and Frustrating for even a DBZ fan,Dragon Ball Z Kai is the result of a heavy handed editor who leaves one wondering if they missed something from episode to episode. One of the worst examples is when Goku is training with King Kai and at the end of the episode he mentions wondering if Goku can master the Kao Kin technique. The next episode mentions nothing about this and Goku is on his way back down snake way. I can understand that DBZ can seem long and drawn out in many cases (long charging and grunting scenes I'm looking at you) but DBZ Kai edits so much out of the show that your missing entire episodes of important character development. Honestly I don't know how someone completely new to the series could follow the show at all.However the picture quality is nice and the new opening is very well done(not sure why they even bother to show Chi Chi since they completely cut her from the show but it is animated very well).
4,"Great Show, Minor Complaints","I Love Dragonball Z, It is one of my Favorite animes, so i recently purchased this product, and I love it, Voice Acting is Great, but I Have one Complaint. Some of the artwork they redrew, is flat out terrible, I burst out laughing at a couple shots, especially Goku on snake way, it took me out of the story, Otherwise it's great, hopefully the Artwork gets better in new seasons."
3,sound quality concern,"Recording string quartets and other small string ensembles is not easy under even ideal conditions. On my equipment, the sound quality -- particularly the first movement of the Mendelssohn -- was both a bit muddy and overly bright. A disappointment."
5,Very much worth reading,"I heartily recommend Thibault's book. It is hard-hitting, clearly written, and commonsensical and cogent in its conclusions. Thibault is truly his own man. His views conform to no particular orthodoxy, and they shine forth in the book with an intensity borne of the deep conviction with which the author believes them. In addition, Thibault is a marvelous sleuth and detective with a keen instinct for running down a story and ascertaining the truth about it."
4,"If you have a heart for kids in trouble, read this book","I read the book and have worked with author in the Juvenile Detention system for six years. If you're interested in first hand insight, and practical, hands-on, methods for reaching troubled youth this book is for you. Billy illustrates proven principles like the power and importance of listening, dealing with anger, and encouraging spiritual growth. I highly recommend this book."
2,Dissapointed,"I purchased this to go with my new Samsung Samsung 32"" UN32C4000PD. Both packages suggested they met the VESA mounting standard 200mm.I Installed the system on the wall - put all the arm together - fairly easy.Problem #1Sanus doesn't include 8M bolts to match the Samsung TV - one trip to hardware store.Problem #2Unless you buy the exact correct length bolt you will get wobbly mount - another trip to store but discovered before luckily...Problem #3The mounting bracket for the Sanus and the bolt openings for the Samsung do not line up - you can only bolt 2 of the 4 at any one time. One of them is not to VESA standards as advertised.Gave up - returned Sanus to store (easier than repacking TV)...see what is next."
4,Product is as slim as a Book!,"Works perfectly in our Kitchen for the TV, and snugs up to the wall perfectly as we had hoped !"
5,Great tv wall mount,"This mount is heavy duty. Everthing you need to mount it to your tv and wall is included. It holds the tv very well. I mounted a 32"" LCD tv, and it stays put, no matter which way I tilt it. The directions are easy to understand, and if you go to their web site the have a video to show you how to install it."
3,TV tilts out of place to easily and hard to keep level,TV mount rotating device is poorly designed and the directions could have been a little more detailed.It is very hard to keep the TV level and keep it from tilting forward. I had to call customer service and they helped me make an adjustment to the rotating device. This helped but it is not perfect. (Customer service was very polite and helpful.)Maybe I was spoiled after my first Sanus mount (VM400b) which I loved. The VM400b mount is far superior and well worth the extra money if you are mounting a TV larger than 26 inches. It installs easier and holds the TV in place.
5,Sanus MF215-B1,This wall mount was easy to install and works great. Nothing complicated and it does exactly what it is supposed to do. Would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to mount a TV on the wall and be able to position it exactly how they want it and not worry about it moving around.
2,Spins,I recently purchased this mount and on the box it states that if you go to the website you can view a video of how to install the mount. After looking all over the website I finally called Sanus and they told me the video is no longer on the website.Once I did get the mount installed I had the same problem that a lot of people seem to have which is the mount spins and once again I called Sanus and nobody ever heard of this problem but they would talk with the technicians and get back to me.They never called me back.I read some of the reviews on amazon and took the mount apart and added the two rubber washers and it now works.I wouldn't recommend this mount or Sanus because they are not very helpful.
4,tv wall mount,Very convenience mounts. Easy to assemble and install.Assemble guide simple and understandable. Highly suggest.
5,Awesome TUNER! It works on my MacBook!,"Man! I live in Marietta, GA - 17 miles from HDTV towers. I can get all HDTV channels with that included antenna!!!! Yes!!! that portable antenna!I have a MacBook 1.83GHz Core Duo with only 512MB of ram running XP Professional.I also have a lot of luck capturing any HDTV program....PERFECT! no freezing...no drop frames...wow...amazing. I use default setting and take those recorded clips on my USB thumb drive to play on my PS3 without any problem. Perfect HDTV qulity on my 40"" TV with 1080P.Well installing part is kind of slow. It took me almost 30 mins to get all software installed and updated. Analog channels are so bad but I really don't care 'coz I've got all my digital channels. Am I a lucky guy or what!"
1,Pinnacle PCTV,"I purchased this receptor to watch TV on my laptop. It became clear thatthe antenna, the overall signal processing of the unit, and my laptoppower were inadequate. Next I tried on my desktop which had much fasterCPU and USB 2.0 and etc. Still, I did not get a good reception. My regularTV with the indoor antenna worked ten times better. My suggestion isdon't waist your money on this."
2,Poor Video Quality,"I just got this today and I installed it and I am not impressed. I wanted to be able to record good quality analog video and also try to view some over-the-air HD programming. I could not recieve any HD programming with the small cord attached to the small antenna but that was not a huge deal. Like I said the analog cable picture quality is very poor. When recorded and converted to DivX, 2 minutes of poor quality video was 22mb. If you can receive over the air HDTV this may work for you, but it did not work for me. It is now on an auction site."
3,clutter assistant,"It does keep things organized in your purse. I had hoped some of the pockets would be deeper, but for the price, it's a great edition to keeping your things organized."
1,Pinnacle: The height of ?????,"I wonder if those who gave this product more than one star are posers from Pinnacle corporate. I note that they write long wordy paragraphs of praise... hmmm. This is an absurd product, pure and simple. It should take no more words to praise it as it does to knock it. Thankfully Amazon will refund."
2,Review of PCTV HD Pro Stick USB2 TV tuner,"I was not able to hook up the product to cable or a satellite box. The attachments for these don't really work. Also, the fact that the antenna has a magnetized base is not made clear, making it hazardous to computer hard drives. Finally, you need a really fast computer on the order of 1.7 Ghz minimum with at least 1GB memory for it to work smoothly."
2,"OK for watching, not so much for recording","I have this setup with my new laptop that runs Vista premium. The device installs ok and it works with media center.It's great for watching tv, but if you have scheduled recordings and you like to have your machine be in ""standby"" mode until it's time to record, you may be disappointed.When coming out of standby, sometimes the tuner is recognized and at other times it is not. When it's not recognized, I have to unplug and then replug the device in order for it to be recognized.Because of this, I have missed several recordings.I contacted pinnacle support and their recommendation was not to use standby."
5,PCTV HD Pro Stick USB2 - Great Buy!,"Very Easy to use, versitile, worth the money. Signal comes in clear and included antenna is very handy."
2,Tuner is alright but software SUCKS!!!!!!!!,The tv tuner works fairly well but the software is total junk. I wouldn't buy this thing again for $10 if I had to use the same software. The recordings look horrible and the program is really glitchy. It takes forever to load and sometimes records with no sound. Don't but this.4
2,Probably not what you're looking for,"The video quality of the video you will be receiving will be severely lacking. If you've got a good signal it could give you an ok standard picture, but the compression rate is just too much to give decent quality to your PC. If the packaged software is also not great and it won't work with a Mac. Overall if you just want to watch TV on the go then this is for you, but if your banking on an 1080p signal look for something else."
3,Can't get it to work with Microsoft Media Center Edition (MCE),"The Tuner worked for me.....once I got Pinnacle online Chat support. I tried the Antenna and it works, but with limited channels (buy an amplified antenna if you don't have cable).I set it up for my Cable service and the Pinnacle software included and my only complaint is the channels are not the same as the TV Guide that comcast has (Media Center had the same guide as Comcast).Otherwise, the I had a lot of channels with the cable plugged into the stick.I think the problem connecting this to Media Center is that its designed for a 32 bit Operating System. My computers have Vista Home Premium 64bit. I looked on Pinnacle and there is driver for 64bit, but I couldn't get it to work.I think I'm going to return this and get the Media Center Extender that syncs up your TV with your computers so you can watch TV via my wireless home network.Hope this helps.I also tried the Pinnacle HD Stick, same results."
1,If you loose the remote you are out of luck.,I bought this product and it works fine. My biggest problem with itis that I lost the remote and when I contacted the company I was told that they do not sell a replacement remote. They told me that I can go to any store that sells their product and buy a replacement. The two stores I went to told me that they did not know why I was told that because they have never seen the remote alone.Bottom line: if you loose the remote there is no way to replace it. That is why I am giving this product a one. If there was a way to give them a zero I would. Be ware of any product that does not offer replacementparts. Especially a remote control.
2,Doesn't work with Vista Media Center,"You can watch HD television with this product, but only using the crappy software that comes with it. Repeated interactions with their offshore tech support yielded only frustration. I returned the product after three full days of trying to get Media Center to see the tuner."
1,Could not record HDTV with this device,"I was able to watch HDTV and digital TV broadcasts received over-the-air using the attenna provided with the Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro Stick. But I could not successfully record TV programs with Pinnacle's Media Center software. I have a 3.0Ghz Pentium 4 with HyperThreading, 2 gb of RAM and a SATA hard drive on my Windows XP system but I think you need a more powerful system to be successful. I noticed that while watching HDTV, my CPU utilization was around 80%. When recording TV programs, the CPU utilization was about 100%. The resulting recording was of poor quality and unwatchable. I tried various recording settings to see if it made any difference but it didn't. I was able to uninstall the Pinnacle software but it made changes to my system that cause some game programs I had to stop working. I tried to do a XP system restore but was unable to do a roll-back. Bottomline: I would not recommend this product."
4,The bygone stage of the late Romanticism!,"The whole impression this Symphony seems to suggest is the enraptured implicit nostalgic flight that dwells inside it. Schmidt was a contempoary composer with Strauss and Schoenberg. But like Joachim Raff, he tries to keep alive the dying torch of the Romantic echoes of his beloved land. Enrooted and influenced by Bruckner, Brahms and Mahler, the color of his melodic motives leave aside a solid architectural building. And so you may listen and even enjoy this inspired vignette of captivating melodies that will delight our senses but hardly to permeate our souls.Neem Jarvi enhances and faced the hiuge challenge to carve in relief the virtues of his music. The Chicago Symphony proves the heavy wieght consistence of his powerful sound but at the end you may find it a music without transcendence. The similar impression you feel with Grieg, Medtner or the Symphonic Scriabin, for instance.Nevertheless the level of the performance justifies and rewards its buying."
4,Quite a Unique Symphonic Expression,"I'm on a second go-round with this work, following close on the heels of a virgin voyage late last night. Having become refamiliarized with early 20th century Austrian composer Franz Schmidt's symphonic masterpiece, the Symphony No. 4, a sidle backwards seemed in order. My word! If one likes to luxuriate non-stop in a certain manner of Late Romantic expression that flows from a seemingly limitless font of symphonic invention, this is for you! I'm not sure what else I can add other than Järvi and the Chicagoans manage to hold it all together in a most satisfying manner. I'd also guess, however, that this may be ""too much"" of a good thing for many listeners; it was somewhat the case for me last night. Perhaps experienced Brucknerians might adjust to the length and architecture more readily, though this is very much of its own expressive style, dating from 1913."
1,NOT a Brother Cartridge - BEWARE,"I thought I was crazy when I opened the box and saw this was a generic toner cartridge, but when I checked my original order confirmation, NO WHERE did it say it was a compatible cartridge, only after it had shipped. POOR BUSINESS PRACTICES, BAIT AND SWITCH. So incredibly unprofessional to trick customers this way. That being said, I have not opened or used it yet, I'm deciding if I want to deal with the hassle of sending it back (though I'm wary considering how crappy their practices have been so far), so it may work fine. I don't know."
4,Brother Toner Cartridge,"Has worked without any problems, as expected of the genuine Brother cartridge. I don't know how well the generic cartridges work, but this is the standard by which they are judged."
3,toner,"Shipping time was great.The quality of the print is dull. I shook it before installing. Then took it out and did it again with very little improvement. I may not get the recommended number of pages form it because I had to increase the print resolution. However, for the price, I will purchase this item again because I am not working with professional presentations."
3,Not bad for the price,"I purchased two CTA BLM-1 batteries in November, 2008 as backups to my two OEM batteries. They have served me well for almost two years. In August I noticed that they were not holding a charge for long and a couple weeks ago, almost two years two the day I bought them neither would take a charge - completely dead - where as my OEM batteries still work like new. Since the price of CTA batteries are only one third or less the cost of the OEM batteries I'd would have to say not bad for the price but you do get what you pay for."
4,Got some heat..,This cayenne pepper is definitely as rated.. plenty of flavor and plenty of heat.. will buy this product again in the future..
4,good snack,"I really like these, but the rest of my family won't eat them. If you like cinnamon and flaky pastry, you'll like these (or not, cause my family likes cinnamon but won't try these)."
5,Desert,I purchased the rasberry flavor as well as this and they are both good. Used them while on weight watchers.
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I've gotten to try similar twists from a well known food retailer that we don't have in the Houston area. Thank goodness I found these online -- they're exactly the same, and what an awesome price!Very light and crispy -- and a perfect snack at 30 calories each, with no sodium or cholesterol!"
5,"Great low-calorie, low-fat treat.","A great low-calorie, low-fat treat. Shipment arrived on time and product was as expected. What else needs to be said?"
1,Don't buy this,"This part is of absolute poor quality and did not work. Production is terrible and it is just too bog not to work,if you are looking for BSPT to NPT for an oil pressure gauge in a Toyota, like I was, then don't buy this"
1,DO NOT ORDER!!!!!,"After reading another review about this not being tapered threads I thought maybe it had been fixed. Sure enough, it is not tapered! Do not order this unless you need parallel threads! Auto Meter needs to fix their crappy product."
1,Not BSPT,"This is not BSPT(tapered) as advertised but BSPP (parallel) threads. If you need BSPT for an oil pressure sender adapter, you may damage your block with this item."
5,It Works Just Right,The top of the funnel is large so I fill my flask without making a mess and wasting. When ever I fill my flask Ialways use this special funnel to do the job right.

3,Not as nice as I thought.,Would not recommend to anyone. I was disappointed in this item. Just going to try to use it anyway thou.
4,Like it.,Just needed an extender for a necklace that i received as a gift. This was exactly what i needed it to be.
4,great product,I used it for a choker necklace that I bought at goodwill that was tight on me. Now I get to wear my necklace and it gives me a lot of flexibility on the lenghth that looks best.
1,"Too Cheaply Made, Don't Bother","I ordered this as an extension to a necklace, but it is so cheap and flimsy that it immediately broke. Immediately! Do not bother ordering this. As others have mentioned here, it came in a lovely, expensive box. Save the box and put the money into the chain please."
1,poor quality,"chain tarnished quickly. did not clean up well. i think it is china cheap plated not real .925 so, they deceived me"
5,Very nice,Bought this Carolyn Pollack extender to go with some of her jewelry. Very satisfied with the quality as with all of Carolyn's products.
5,"Well made, does what it's supposed to","Exactly what I needed for some of my necklaces that are just a bit too short. Very well made, lovely packaging, quick shipment."
4,Am I a Child?,"I'm usually quite careful about the money I spend and all that. But somehow it escaped me that this is a children's book. I thought it was close to a tourguide (and there seem to be no tourguides specializing in El Salvador).Now I'm not going to be an @$$ and give it a bad review because I made a mistake. This is a simply written, glossy photo-full book with lots of facts. It reminds me a lot of an atlas meant for children, but concentrated on El Salvador. Not bad. And I don't hate myself for buying it, given my fascination with the world.If I had a child, I'd certainly pass it along to them to ignite their imagination about other places and also help them understand that their standard of living as an American (born into any economic bracket) should not be taken for granted."
1,"Compilation, not original","While I agree the magnets that come with the book are fun and demonstrate the power of magnetizing in a tangible way, unofortunately they are about the only original thing in the book. This book is perfect for anyone who wants a volume that is a compilation of a ton of already known quotes, jokes, poems and even a Hallmark greeting card sentiment. There is a lot of the Abraham-Hicks material as well but I would recommend you go straight to Abraham-Hicks to get that. There is some original work in this book but not much. It's really more like the author had a huge file of clippings and put them in a book. It's like it all got dumped in there without much flow. I like an author to take concepts and put their own spin on it but Sharon Warren merely compiled a plethora of other people's concepts - no spin, just two cool little magnets. I would highly recommend any of the Catherine Ponder books, Wayne Dyer books, and the Abraham-Hicks materials."
3,Useful but repetitive,"The message of this book is important - that you can make anything real with focused attention and creating the feeling of already having your desires. I enjoyed some of the book's anecdotes and stories. However, this book could have been much shorter and more effective if the author had not been so repetitive. The author tended to say the same thing over and over again with the result that it did not flow well at all. A book that I would recommend for anyone trying to improve their life is ""Fast Food for the Soul"" or ""The Road to Power"". Both books are by Barbara Berger, who really knows how to give concise and effective information on creating your best life ever, without ever being repetitive or drawn-out. Go buy it!"
5,Delightful,"A delightful, inspirational, easy to graspguide to understanding the fundamental conceptsthat underlie the life we all live.Follow Sharon's guidance and create a consciousnessthat will attract all the good that you can imagine.Bruce I. Doyle, III, Ph.D.Author, Before You Think Another ThoughtBefore You Think Another Thought: An Illustrated Guide to Understanding How Your Thoughts and Beliefs Create Your Life"
4,Eddy Was The Coolest!,"This album plays like the soundtrack to my college freshman year in 1983. Even with its 80's electronic beats, it still sounds fresh. I dare you to not sing along!"
4,The Great Reggae Master !!!!,"Dont listen to the other Retarded Reviewer from Fountain valley california, Eddie Grant Has Not and Never Will Do DRUGS of Any Type!!!Eddie Believes in Spirituality and Sobriety,,, This is a Great Album and is Not meant for Lying Stoners like the other Moron reviewer,Mons Mabelle??? lol"
3,If you like Troop Force you might like this.,"I have had this artist's song ""Electric Avenue"" stuck in my head since the early 80's. I once saw Eddy Grant at the old Hi-Time liquor store in Costa Mesa. He saw me buying a corncob pipe with my friend Alex. He winked at us and yelled ""You boys gonna have high time tonight"" in an Asian accent, which I thought was odd. He seemed like a nice man."
2,Eddy Grants Worst.,"This is definately Eddy Grants worst album!!Hearts and Diamonds is his best album, and then Going Broke.Don't buy this album as a introducer to Eddy Grant buy all his other albums.Just because it has one hit ""Electric Avenue"" ( Which isnt his best) on it so buy "" Hearts And Diamonds"" or "" Going Broke"".The album overal, is somewhat of a normal reggea standard."
3,DOES NOT FLOAT,My four year old Grandson had a pirate birthday yesterday. I got this for him and he was so dissappointed that it does not float. If you take everything off the top it kind of floats. They need to redesign this.
3,pirate raft,"BUYER BEWARE! I found this product to be deceiving. The box depicts pirate figures, treasure chest etc. but the fine print indicates that the product is really only the basic raft. The toy is well made and quite durable, however it can be frustrating for little kids when the mast falls out very easily."
4,"""Kello on kahdeksan...""","This cell phone is quite a good one. It has a talking alarm-clock in it. The sound level is quite good one. you can be sure that you wake up while it is ringing. It is also just right size. There's quite a good rechargeable battery. It takes a week to be empty. Two of the games are quite good (Snake Xenzia and Rapid Roll) but Soccer League is a very stupid one. You will always if take the easiest level. Well, it is quite a good cell phone, reminders are quite good."
4,Nice Piece,"Fantastic! can't ask more for the price I paid.Voice is clear, light weight, battery recharge is quick and last really long and this piece comes with hands-free set(wired)."
1,Not Good,"Phone is really cheap, But it doesn't work as expected, When the caller disconnected the calls and the call is not picked up, still the phone is keep on ringing. and the screen display is also not changed.I tried with another piece also, It does have the same problem.I wouldn't recommend this phone for someone."
4,Best Product in less price.,"If you are looking for the basic functions in less price,this is the best option."
4,light weight but surprisingly good,"When we first opened this we thought that we had made a big mistake because it was so light and cheap feeling. However, it has surprisingly good sound quality and when you use the hands free earpiece it still works really well."
5,Simply first choice !,"I must have owned more than a dozen versions of this work on CDs and this is by far the finest. What is most impressive, among other things is the outstandingly successful recording. The final chorus Amen is overwhelming : it brought tears in my eyes on many occasions when I listen to it, thanks to the clarity of the recording of the different vocal parts. The orchestral contribution must also be mentioned. Desert island disc !"
1,Mystery item,I can't buy items unless I know exactly what they are. This doesn't tell anywhere on the page just how many milligrams are in each capsule.
1,Do not order from this company!!!!!,It received one star because the site does not allow any lower rating. Instead of receiving the items pictured and described I received D&G samples similar to those given out for free at any cosmetics counter. There was no packing slip enclosed. I sent a letter asking for a return envelope and a credit to my account or the items pictured on the website. I received no response. I then researched this company and it is an automotive supply company....apparently one of their employees runs a scam on the side.
2,Men still won't sleep with me,"I was certain once I ordered this T-shirt that men would be powerless to resist me. Cats are stealthy, graceful, and mysterious. I was under the impression that once I donned this post-modernist masterpiece, that men would associate me with those qualities. Sadly that has not been the case. However, even though men don't stare at my breasts (as hoped), I noticed that cats do, so at least I am getting some attention."
2,A terrible recording of a great piece,"Mendelssohn's Elijah is a great piece of music, but this recording does not do it justice. The problem starts at the top, with Willard White's wobbly Elijah. He constantly attacks his notes from below. The sound is mediocre at best, and the tempos are annoyingly slow. Instead, try the new Bryn Terfel recording."
2,Dull with mediocre soloists,"Elijah is Mendelssohn's choral masterpiece, ranking with Haydn's Creation and the great oratorios of Handel, but this recording does not do it justice. The LSO and LS Chorus are of course world-class ensembles, but turn out utterly dull and shapeless performances of what should be rousing choruses, and the soloists all seseem to be plagued with intonation problems. Willard White's rough, gravelly voice might appeal to some as the appropriate characterization of the prophet, but the soprano and alto sound as if they had mouths full of marbles, with words barely recognizable, probably will not.Another strike against this recording is the muddy sound."
5,Classy and high quality,"Received this as a Christmas gift and love it. Looks great sitting on the desk, and leaves a nice imprint. I use it with flexible sealing wax so the letter can travel through the mail system without the seal cracking or breaking off. Very pleased!"
5,Got this for my friend:,She was so tickled to have this. This was only D stamp I could find that I liked and her reaction just confirms my opinion.
3,Inclusive and indepth...Jesus,"Detailed, long lasting impressions are what you are left with after reading and hopefully chewing over key issues in this book. I love seeing Christ move across our country in bold and vivid color. This book gave me an appreciation for the Catholic church and insight into modern day Calvinism and more. Great read for the serious students of theology.However, this book tends to manifest Christ in a way that takes Him out of your heart and places Him into your head. That was kind of a bummer to me. Good read but my money is on the bible."
4,"Read ""The Dream Illuminati"" first","""The Illuminati of Immortality"" builds on the cast of characters and plot of ""The Dream Illuminati"" without explaining any of what was in that first book, so if you didn't read it you may feel lost for the first few chapters. It's an engaging fiction story for its own sake, but the enormously interesting part in my opinion comes toward the end as the visualization of the alchemical process of the characters happens. For students of spiritual alchemy, this is quite a good head trip!"
4,"Neural flights, Spiritual heights","Recently finished this mind-expanding epic and am still bristling with intellectual energy. Little potent seeds of revolutionary thought will gradually impregnate your mindscape as you are taken on spiritual/ sci-fi adventures that jump start the soul. Pre-conceived notions of reality are delightfully challenged and a sort of modern alchemy ensues that after hypnotically engaging the reader, leaves a tangible neural charge.For those who want not merely a story but a psychic voyage through past, present, and future, this noble work truly satisfies."
3,Plisse House Coat,"This housecoat came just today - very fast. I'm disappointed in it. The fit is true to size but the material is very thin and flimsy. I may be glad when summer comes but right now I don't like it much. The colors are not as bright as the picture shows. In fact, the entire housecoat is not as attractive to me as the picture.I really like dealing with National so I hate to give them a low rating. I won't return it because of the cost of postage. I'll just keep it to wear around the house."
5,A Perfect Partnership,"Korcia and Luisada are perfect partners .All tracks are played with an exact mixture of good technique and passion .I've seen Korcia two times in So Paulo , Brasil .He's really magnetic !!! Someone who really has deserved play Paganini's violin , in Genova .On his last presentation , last year , we talked and he signed this CD and DANSES ( nave ), too. I hope to see him again .Lovely album !"
1,Still Scared,"I was a thumb sucker and I was given this book to read as a wartime evacuee aged 6 in 1942. It scared me stiff then, and has been haunting me ever since. I never thought to see the day that it would come back to haunt me afresh...See it through the eyes of a child. Ban it now say's he; while still sucking a thumb! I only awarded it one star because from the instructions I wasn't allowed to give less."
5,Reality,"LTC Burruss, wrote one of the definitive books on the use of indigineous troops in the Vietnam conflict. The tactics, techniques and procedures learned by the men of the Mike Force in battle, have now been passed to a new generation of Special Forces soldier now fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.COL(R) John Tobin, SF"
3,Mike Force,Interesting historical account of an officer's involvement with Mike Force. Adds to the limited public information on that aspectof the Vietnam War.
2,Product is expired,"The product, in general, seems as though it is probably descent ... or was probably descent. I ordered as a gift in February of 2011. The product I received has an expiration date of 1-08, three years expired! The eye cream smells like rancid oil. The other products in the box seem okay, but I can't believe selling a new product that has an expiration date three years before it was purchased. I gave two stars because, well, I'm not sure really. It looks to have been a descent product some time ago. Part of it is just horribly rancid. There is no way any one would put something that smells like that anywhere on their body, let alone their face."
1,What a disappointment!,"I purchased this product based on reviews I had read that their cats ""loved this healthy treat"", well I tried giving it to my cat, and she won't come near it... reviewed by [...]"
5,Cats love these!,"My younger cat is vulnerable to UTIs so I have to look for treats that suit him. I have never seen both my cats so frantic over treats, except maybe when I offered them raw frozen meat for cats. And this is MUCH cheaper. Thank you for bringing the awesome!"
2,Cat Doesn't Like Treats,"I tried these after my old cat had a serious bladder infection, but she doesn't like them very well. Will eat one or two, then stops. Pretty expensive for the amount in the bag but it would have been much less than vet bills if only she had eaten it."
3,Vauge Instructions,The instructions for this unit are so vauge that it would be impossible to install unless you are a professional installer.
5,Beautiful outfit,"Loved this outfit! I collect 10.5"" dolls from the fifties. This dress just fits my doll. The shoes are a little small because they are made for Cissette, but I was able to squeeze them on my doll. I think the dress has a vintage look to it...I really like that, and it is difficult to find. I wish there were more like this for sale on Amazon. Great detail/quality as you expect with Madams Alexander!"
4,Got it from a friend for 2 weeks,"My friend liked it and I can see why, nice and keeps the bugs off of you. Stong and well made, very simple to use as well. This item is a what you see it what you get. So it works, well made and easy to carry."
4,compfy and relaxing,This is one of those hidden gems in my option. I have been camping since I was in grade school and I don't think I ever slept so well in a tent.Let me break this downPros:bug net built in.durable materiallongish anchor ropesreally comfortablea good economic valueCons:water wicks down anchor ropes in heavy rainI found the directions a bit confusingover all for the money I spent it was a good value and I can see myself using this hammock many times over. I was caught in a bit of rain on my last trip and although I was under a tarp the very ends where the anchor ropes meet the hammock got a bit wet but the part I was sleeping in was dry so it wasn't a problem.
2,Too fragile,This product is unfortunately too lightly made to be useful for any real day in day out use. Probably would be best suited for people that weigh less than 170lbs. I never understood why they didn't incorporate a canopy into this design because if you're going to really camp in it you will need rain protection. I thought I could save money by getting this vs. the Clark Jungle Hammock. In the end I had to get another product because this one is just too flimsy for my needs.
1,broken,broke the first time i used it and i cannot find any listing for replacementparts.would not buy again.
5,Great buy,"ITs greats, I have enough to last a lifetime but i got it at a price that a 3 oz contain would cost at any other store. I advise the purchase of this because Cayenne pepper is very good for your health i have a shake or 2 every morning and i feel better for."
1,If this book was a term paper,"The author is promoted as being a professor at a College in Gettysburg. My experience from reading this book and relating it to the work that I did at University would be that the professor would give me an ""F"" and in the margins of the paper, he/she would point out that I used too many quotes and let my resources tell the story.There are far too many ""eye witness"" accounts strung together with too few words that actually belong to the author. I found the book to be a redundant drudgery of regurgitated research."
4,The Gettysburg Gospel,"The book is a fairly comprehensive account of how the battle affected the town and the nation, providing the atmosphere which made the speech so poignant. I found a little tiring the attention given to the ""great orator"" who was the featured speaker of the dedication ceremony. His lengthy oration paled by comparison with the simple, moving words of President Lincoln. It's not surprising, then, that Lincoln's address has become one of the most memorable dedicatory remarks ever while the other was relegated to the dust bins of history."
4,The Greatest Speech by America's Greatest President,"I remember having to memorize The Gettysburg Address in elementary school as part of my history class. This books contains a lot of documents from eye witnesses who were present several days before the dedication through several days after Lincoln's famous speech.This book is very educational and a few parts gets a little boring, but overall it is worth the read. I believe all school children should be required to memorize and give the speech in class like I had too. Properly educating children on historical American facts are so important today. We have too many liberals trying to re-write our history."
2,Did nothing for my hair.,"This product was recommended b/c my hair was a bit dry from coloring.I purchased it and used it. I did not see any type of results. Good nor bad ones. My hair stayed the same. For the price that I had paid, one would think this product would have worked better. The product did not do what it was supposed to do. Maybe it was just me?"
1,Very drying!!,"I have very fine, oily, thin, super straight hair. Hoping this would pouf my hair a bit (don't know why I thought that), I purchased and began using every day. I couldn't tell anything right away, but after a couple of months, my hair was SUPER dry and starting to break. At my next hair appt., I told my hairdresser what I had been using, and she said that any treatment with a lot of protein will do that to hair. Yikes!! So I quit using it, and it took a couple of months for it to feel normal again. Maybe I used too much?? Scared to try it again, though."
1,"Horrible product, my hair looked like a cotton candy.","I used this twice and my hair was impossible to comb, even to run my fingers through it. I never bought a product so bad. Don't wast your money on it, it's to damage the hair not to treat it."
4,A great read,"I met the author at a local author's signing in Purcellille, VA. What a treat to take the book home and find it to be very well written, suspenseful and one I recommend wholeheartedly!!"
5,Condition well represented,My daughter loved the book. The conditions was just as the seller stated. The price was good. We are both pleased.
3,A study in violating Anthropological Ethics,"I read this book for a women's book club that I am in. This is a good study of the Yanomame People. Interlaced with this study is the personal travesties of Kenneth Good violating all ethics of Anthropolgy. The book club women had a general consensus that this was borderline, it not full blown pediaphilia. A good book for Anthroplogy students who are studying the Ethics of their profession."
2,A whining anthropologist and pedophile,"Good goes into the Amazon to a primitive people to measure their food intake and how they acquire it - hunting and gardening. He manages to piss off three different universities that participate in funding his research and then whines that he is broke. He complains about the rules that Venezuela has for access to these primitive people.If you can get past the self-aggrandizement and the whining, you will be appalled at the notion of him accepting the promise of a native 9 year old wife. He eventually impregnates her and moves her to New Jersey where she has no idea of what's going on. The notion that he would go to work when she has a baby or that he would obey a policeman is completely foreign to her experience. She hasn't been taught English. They eventually have more kids and the sad ending is that she goes back to the jungle and he keeps the kids in New Jersey. Talk about unprofessional!"
3,"Good rocker, but needs work","Overall, I've been happy with this rocker, but for the price, I expected more.Pros:- Good looking chair- You can use it from day one (the chair fully reclines)- Once the baby is big enough he/she can rock themselves with their weight- Folds nicely and compactly (it would be easy to travel with)Cons:- The harness straps are cheap and extremely difficult to take on and off- The cover is attached to the toy bar, and you cannot push it back making it impossible keep the toys hanging without full cover- It's impossible to take the baby in or out of the bouncer with the cover on.- You can barely feel the vibrator. It's almost pointless to have it as a feature."
1,Very badly designed,"This rocker is badly designed and cheaply built. For example, it is very uncomfortable to get the baby in and out of it. More importantly, the front handle only holds as long as the hood is in place. If the hood gets out of its base, then the whole handle folds and detaches from the chair. This is extremely dangerous and it is very hard to understand how the guys at Maclaren missed this.Avoid."
4,Best book I have read that was written by a celebrity.,This is the best book that I have ever read that was written by a celebrity. It was written many years before it became the fashion for Star Trek stars to write science fiction books. I have read many of the other ones that have come out over the years and Mirror Friend Mirror Foe is the best so far. Of course with a co-author as good as Robert Asprin it would be hard to go wrong. The is a very good science fiction book to read even if you don't consider who the authors are.
4,FUN RACING GAME!,It's been a few years since I've owned a NASCAR game but in wanting to try something new (i.e. not a 1st person shooter) I gave it a shot.All-in-all a fun game. The steering is difficult and you really have to practice to get the car set-up correct on each track. In other words practice makes perfect. The online racing is also a good touch and an easy way to test your skills (and find out you're not all that good).Only issue would be the lack of racing your customized car online and the fact that online racing can still only have 4 real users (albeit you can race against 32 ai cars at the same time).If you're a Nascar fan...and you know that RUBBIN' IS RACING...then give it a shot!
3,Comparable,The driver assist option is not available on all tracks when u use it on the Xbox 360. So sometime you can not use this feature
3,"Pretty Involved, Action Packed, A few Bugs","This is a pretty cool game overall. I don't get to use the total team control feature because it's function is tied to the spare thumbstick which my steering wheel doesn't support, but even without the feature this game is a lot of fun. I spend quite a bit of white knuckle time racing the big boys on quick races. The career mode is fun too, start out a little guy and work your way up through the ranks. It's gotten so cheap to buy this game I would rate it a definite buy if you've only got a few bucks to burn."
3,Good game but could be better,"I have been playing this game for months on end and I also find this game incredibly easy. The problem is the game breaks for you in the corners without you having to do it yourself. You just mash the gas and go! Also, you don't really get a good sense of TEAM because the teams you own already exist. It would be better if I could own my own team with my name and all my own cars.However, the graphics are a little better. You get a better feel for what it is actually like going around corners and not being able to see too far in front of you. And I still find myself playing the game over and over because I love NASCAR so much. So if you do too I would get this game."
4,Mixed Feelings,"""Cannons In The Rain"" is one of John Stewart's early albums and I feel that it is still one of his best.If possible I would rate ""Cannons In The Rain"" at six stars.This CD has just about everything that is good about John Stewart.I feel that his voice is at its' best and the songs are earthy with a nice balance of insight and cynicism.I got hooked on ""Anna On A Memory"" the first time I heard it and I still play it again and again and again.I guess there must be some stray dog in me.""Wingless Angel"" is a different matter, it is good but seems to be incomplete.I never have been able to really get ""into"" this CD for some reason.To sum it up, I frequently play ""Cannons In The Rain"" and rarelylisten to ""Wingless Angel"".If these CDs were separate I would rate ""Wingless Angel"" at three stars."
3,An anthology of Irish Literature II,"A good Anthology of irish Literature, I've already bought the first volume.Good service, quicklier received than the previous one."
5,Good condition,"I was honestly expecting a better condition, but I was still ok with it. Only had a few highlight marks in the first chapter. I got the book before expected so I was happy with that."
3,Our Sexuality textbook,what is the edition of this book? it makes a big difference if it's a 4th or a 10th edition!
2,Avoid if possible,"I got this unit with a new construction home. In the beginning everything was fine. Then this month the antenna stopped connecting. LeGrand does not provide residential customers with support (First clue). Their authorized agent in the Phila Area is an electrical contractor that does not do ANY residential service or support. Basically when the warranty expires you are SOL as far as service is concerned. I had to open it up to determine that this is actually a ASUS device (WL-330g personal access point)ASUS COMPUTER INTL - ASUS WL-330g Pocket Wireless Access Point. Figuring this should be a easy swap. I ordered a replacement WL-330g, only to find out that the contractor jerry rigged POE (Power Over Ethernet) splitter cooked itself. Called ASUS support and no one seems to know what POE is. Avoid LeGrand ON-Q at all costs if possible! Horrible support and a marginal product at best"
4,A Useful Reference Source for Scottish Folklore,"A small encyclopedia of the creatures of Scottish folklore, NOT OF THIS WORLD provides well researched entries that are usually over a page or two in length. Accounts of actual encounters and fragments of poetry enhance the creatures' descriptions and endow them with a feeling of myth rather than one of pure fantasy. There is no index, which would have been useful since ""Kelpie"" is listed in the W's under ""Water Horses and Kelpies,"" but the table of contents is thorough. There is also a very good bibliography of sources consulted. A few rough pen and ink sketches are included. However, if you are interested in illustrations of the featured creatures, amazing artwork depicting nearly all of them can be found in the book FAERIES by Brian Froud and Alan Lee."
5,"""Awesome""","I've own these speakers for a year. I'm no big analyst when it comes to rating stereo equipment and speakers (especially the high end stuff like bose) but let me put it to you like this! If you want to feel your music (bass and all) and love to have those ""club"" type parties (in the privacy of your own home) and would love to have your neighbors complain about your music, get these speakers. These speakers are not for those individuals who like to sit and listen to beethoven all day (no offense!). They are made for people (like me) who love bass, who loves their music loud and loves to feel their music. For anyone looking for that party speaker, these are the ones to purchase. ""word of warning: they are heavy speakers!"""
3,Poorly written,"The book is written in a very segmented form. If you are looking for a reference book that you can look up sections for specific presentations or papers, this is the book for you. It is, however, hard to just sit down and read from cover to cover."
3,Not quite what I expected of The Kingdom,I thought the choir was drowned out by the orchestra and the choir sometimes seemed a bit distorted so I was disappointed especially as my choir has performed this work in Derby Cathedral. My dad does not agree. He thinks the CD is great. So there you are.
5,Wonderful rare club remixes,"So many must have tracks on here. In particular the Loic Rathscheck remix of Colony 5's ""My World"" is essential. Other amazing tracks-- ""Song For The Lonely"" by Boytronic, ""Memories"" by NamNamBulu remixed by Diskonnekted, and more."
3,"well played, but dull performance","Dukas' Piano Sonata and Variations, Interlude and Finale are two great turn of the century works that deserve to be known by every piano music lover. Fingerhut is a meticulous pianist, she plays with clarity and focus. Unfortunately, her performances, especially of the great Piano Sonata in E-flat minor, are dull. To get a better idea of what the piece should sound like, I recommend the fantastic recording by John Ogden (on EMI). Having performed both works myself, I know of the great technical demands Dukas presents and am sympathetic to Fungerhut's concern over tempos. However, Fingerhut's performance of the Sonata lasts nearly 48 minutes, whereas, John Ogden's takes only 41 minutes. Her tempos are slow enough to add 7 minutes to an already long work!"
3,"Great shine, but can be a workout to use in hotter climates.","I bought this product to use for my cars and truck, to keep the gloss in-between wax jobs.Pros: Applies easy, great price, sprays out of sprayer bottle well.Cons: this product tends to streak, thus needing more muscle to blend in.When the weather is over 75, your car must be in the shade for hours to cool it down enough to keep this product from streaking. I sat mine in the garage for 2 hours, and still had lots of streaks. I had to use more muscle to power wipe the wax into the paint, and that was annoying for a ""detail"" product. This may be a great product for use in cooler climates, or it may not have blended well with the thick wax coat already on my car and trucks. This is a polymer-Wax blend."
4,"nice performances, but somewhat mediocre pieces","I was not familiar with these two Vaughn Williams pieces before buying this recording. I was somewhat disappointed with the pieces themselves, as they lack melody and a sense of structure. Surely, there are some repeated motives here and there, but the rather ""corny"" use of the female chorus and celesta in the symphony make the music sound like the soundtrack to a 1950's ""B"" horror movie. And, the choral piece is much less interesting than Vaughn Williams' Serenade to Music.The performances, however, are good."
5,God's Little Devotional BOOK FOR Moms,"I love this book! This is the 4th one I have bought ( 1 for me 3 for gifts). I recommend it to all moms. It has a short saying and a scripture on one side and a short story on the other side, all three relate.Love it!!"
1,Cats won't eat them,"We have four cats and none of them would touch these treats. I was really hoping they would like them because I like that they are supposed to have a calming effect. Whenever we go out of town it is very stressful on our cats so it would have been nice if these treats would work - I have no idea if they do work, however, since the cats wouldn't eat them. I am a professional pet sitter so I brought the treats to a few of my clients' homes and none of their cats would touch them either."
1,Cats don't seem to like them,"I just noticed that in the picture the treats look pink, but the ones I got they were black.Anyway, I thought this would be a good treat for my friend's old cat since they were soft. I wanted to test them out with my cats first to see if they would like them. I have four cats and neither of them would eat it, they would smell it and that's it. It was pretty obvious they didn't like them, and they have eaten other cat treats before. I then tried my friend's cat, he also wouldn't eat them."
2,Not palatable for my felines,"I could not get either of my cats (both of whom need to chill!) to even taste these ""treats."" So I have no way of knowing if the ingredients work or not, unfortunately."
1,3 cats - none eat,"We have 3 cats. They all have slightly different preferences on treats. Some like soft ones, some like hard ones, some like fish more, some cheese. But they all eat all of the treats we have ever bought. Not a one will eat these. Waste of money."
3,Cats won't eat them,"With three cats, everything gets eaten - except these treats. Even Carson (age 2) - who eats almost anything and everything - won't touch these."
2,Cat wouldn't eat them,"Nutri-Vet Pet Ease Soft Chews, 2.5 OunceI bought 7 bags of these Nutri-Vet Pet ease calming treats and thankfully Amazon is letting me return the 6 unopened bags. At first my 7 yr old male cat seemed to like them but I can only get him to eat one (if any at all). For his size, he needs at least 6. I've tried forcing them but he just spits them out as soon as he can. It's labeld as Tuna but Tuna is the 23rd of 25 ingredients. Way below things like Cheddar Cheese Powder, Chicken, Dried Whole Eggs, etc. I will need to try a different product to hopefully find one he'll eat. thanks Amazon for being so helpful!"
5,more Family friendly viewing,Another wonderful look into the not-so-dull life of Ramona Quimby. She finds out just how much her mother loves her.
5,Aroma AHP312 Hot Plate,Excellent product. Heats well. Cleans up easy. Bought it for my newly turned 18 year old daughter for her first studio apt. If she can work it easily anyone can.
1,not good,does not work properly. does not heat. not happy with this product. not worth it.do not buy it. wouldn't recommend it to anyone
1,Didn't last long,"Just stopped working recently...it was working well for my boyfriend, and he didn't use it much...sad products these days are made to become waste very quickly."
1,Stopped working after 12 uses.,"True, this little hotplate is not very expensive, but still, it's lost money when the bloody thing stops working!!It was not dropped, it was not dunked into water, it wasn't left ON by accident. It just ceased to work while I was frying bacon.I wish the sellers on Amazon.com would show the country where the item is made. The one I received has a tag on the bottom: Made in China.I don't have anything against those workers, but I'm not buying ""Made in China"" products any longer. Why? Because they break or fall apart. I'm looking for a MADE IN USA hotplate now."
2,"Great product, but mine died too","I have to concur with the majority of other reviewers. I have one as well, and I really liked it but for some reason it doesn't respond any longer. It's built nicely, and I like the surface of the burner, but it no longer heats up. I've had mine for a few months and used it moderately (some weeks heavy, some weeks lighter) during that time."
3,"Perfect for light use, no good for heavy use","We use our hot plate to keep a pot of coffee warm. We drink a *lot* of coffee, so our hot plate is on for about 14 hours out of every 24. We've now purchased (via our local Target) four of these Aroma hot plates, and each of them has died after no less than 6 months but no more than a year. The failure mode, though, is a bit frightening. The gizmo that turns the warmer back off when it reaches the right temperature simply stops detecting the right temperature, and we come back to find the coffee pot at a lovely boil. Not good for the coffee, and frightening in its potential for fires.So... it works great, right up until it doesn't work well at all. If you're going to use yours a lot less frequently, buy it."
1,Not worth it,"If you are looking for something that takes a half hour to boil water, then this is the range for you. The only positive thing about it is that you will never burn anything as it never gets that hot. There are much better choices than this one so save your money and get a different brand."
2,"Started strong, but was short lived.","I bought this product with high hopes as my living space did not come with a stove. The hot plate consists of two heating surfaces; a large one that is fairly hot and a small one that is not as hot. Both take forever to get hot enough to cook anything or boil water. Everything was smooth sailing for the first five months. Now however, halfway though the fifth month the larger cooking surface suddenly stopped working. I guess if it was actually 30 dollars then this is the result I would expect. If you are looking to use a hot plate often as your main cooking appliance this is not the one for you."
1,One Month,"The hotplate was shipped to me on October 21, I began using it November 17, and it was working yesterday (January 1) but the large burner was dead cold today, (January 2). Amazon says my return window expired November 27, but I can return it for a ""partial"" refund.For a $30 unit, is a refund worth pursuing through the manufacturer's warranty?Don't buy this hotplate unless you're willing to rotate them as disposable units."
5,"""Does it's Job""","You pay for a burner that can boil water and fry some easy foods. This works great. No complaints. Easy heat control, and easy to clean burn area. I picked up a second hand one and saved big too!"
4,Good stove,The stove was cheap and portable yet is of a high quality. No problems so far and it fulfills my cooking needs.
2,"Large burner defect ,","Ordered first double hotpate before Christmas had it about there days, large burner quit working. Amazon placed the hotplate no problems with super fast shipping. Second hotplate was working fine until the large burner quit working again. Did not botherto send it back. Just went local and bought 2 Brentwood brand single burners. So far so good."
3,Good enough for light duty and the price,"I purchased two of these, which I will need to use for a couple of months instead of my range, while other appliances (ovens and microwave) are functional. The main purpose is to fry and braising. I decided to buy this one instead of a more expensive one due to lack of clear information and shipping concerns on others.This unit is designed to be used with pots and pans between 6 and 7.5 inches, smaller than what I thought. It works really good with small items, like two-egg omlettes, and you can make one good hamburger, however if I try to squeeze two hamburgers at the same time it does not keep up with the rate of water evaporation needed and the end up being boiled. You can improve the performance somewhat by preheating a heavy weight cast iron skillet.It takes a little practice to figure out the inertia on the temperature control, it dies not respond as fast as my cooktop.I would recommend this without reservations for light duties or emergencies."
3,Takes forever to heat,I bought this for my work place. We've been using it daily (between multiple people) for a year and it's still holding up. Just takes too long to boil water. There doesn't seem to be much difference between low heat and high heat. It's all the same.
2,cheap piece of crap,i have had for 3 months now - it buzzes -makes noise- it looks nice but dont count as heavy duty
3,Great Function / Bad Ethics,Used for EVERY meal and tea for 7 months. It boiled water and fried food as expected. After seven months it stopped working but given how much I used it I don't think it's unreasonable for the price. The only reason I'm knocking 2 stars off is because you shouldn't have to replace a whole appliance every 7 months. You should be able to repair a product like this. Planned obsolescence is unethical! Not to mention what kind of factory conditions does it take for it to be priced so low?
2,"Quit working in 6 weeks, warranty requires paying shipping & $15","This Dual hotplate worked fine for about 6 weeks - then quit altogether without being mishandled in any way. It was beyond the 30 day Amazon return window, so I was going to return it to the manufacturer. I pulled out the warranty and found you must pay your own shipping (the thing is fairly heavy) and send an additional $15.00. Since the unit only cost $38, I decided it wasn't worth the trouble to get another one which might break again."
2,This is not ideal hot plate to make a hot pot or steamboat,"I bought this to cook hot pot. However the hot plate doesn't even boil the water. It took so long. As you know hot pot is not supposed to be eaten like that, waiting raw meat or things to be cooked for a long time. I would recommend hot plate from County Market. It is about $16 too. It is so good and it heats up hot pot in a minute."
1,Worked for 1 month,Worked great for 1 month. it stopped working as of yesterday. its cheap...for a reason. going back to my old trusty method.
2,The burner is so tiny,"A previous reviewer said she used hers to can with, so that is why I ordered it. I'd just like to know what SIZE canner she used. The burner is so TINY that there is no way it could heat all the water in my 32-quart canner! If, like me, you want to be able to can with a portable unit, look elsewhere."
3,Slow response to control,Product is just Ok for the price but response to the control is very slow.I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Stylish but not quite what we wanted,"I admit what really made me buy it was the style - more sleek and modern than the old coil type hot plates. We purchased this item expecting it to get and stay hot, We can do a kettle of tea on it, but it does shut off before we can do kettle number two.If you're trying to heat hookah coals, don't bother. It won't get or stay hot enough for that. You'll need a regular coil hot plate."
2,poor range,Did not work right out of the box. The heating elements did not get hot. So I had to return it otherwise I would be throwing money away. Do not buy.
2,It did not last long,"I bought this burner two years ago for my office. I used it in average twice a (working) day to boil water for tea or make Italian coffee. So, not exactly an intense service. Yet, it just died last week, without apparent reason. The light turns on, but there is no heat. It was easy to clean, but its in-function light is too dim. You need to turn the ambient light off, in order to see it. This means it is easy to leave it on accidentally."
2,Not very powerful,"I would not recommend this hotplate if you need something to cook on. It would be fine for melting, reheating, or keeping warm. Besides the small cooking surface it takes a long time for the element to heat up."
1,Stopped Working after 1 month,"It worked great for 1 month, and suddenly stopped working. Now, the light doesn't come on when I turn it on, and the plate doesn't heat up anymore. What a piece of junk."
5,Does the trick - so far,I've only had it a few days... But it came nice and fast. It worked immediately. I've only made coffee on it so far with my Bialetti Express and it boiled the water no problem.I'll update once I try some cooking...
5,Perfect for dyeing wool,"I purchased this item for the purpose of dyeing fleece. It could not be more perfect. It sustains the perfect ""simmering"" point for dyeing fleece. It is compact, easy to store and easy to use."
4,Perfect for tailgating,I was very impressed how fast this product shipped to my house (less than 48 hrs with free shipping). The product itself does exactly what it is supposed to do and I am excited to use if for tailgates. I love the warm setting that will allow me to keep food hot with out me having to regulate a flame. I am very happy with my experience and recommend this item to other people looking for a great tailgating tool. (Must have cigarette lighter outlet converter sold separately)
3,"heavy bottom, decent but only had it about a month",the one by toastmaster with similar heating element on top only lasts one year so i had to buy this one since both of mine clunked out.this takes a while to start heating up but after initial heating it's just fine. I've only used it for minor cooking like eggs or beans (for rice and beans) so I can't say much else right now.
1,"""Aroma"" is toxic","All I wanted was a simple looking single burner to boil water for tea. It states in the manual that you should turn it on to the High setting for a few minutes before using. When I did this, a burning plastic sort of smell-toxic-fume filled the room. I turned it off and waited for it to cool down, then took it to my kitchen, placed it under the vent hood and turned it on High again, this time for 3 hours!!!. It still stinks up the room as soon as I turn it on. This thing is horrible."
2,"What a coincidence, mine was dead after serveral months too","Just used it for a couple of times, suddenly dead out of nothing after six month. Can not turn on heat anymore. should read reviews here before my purchase."
1,non functioning product,"The Aroma AHP-303 single hot plate that I ordered on October 3, 2009 does not work. Unfortunately I did not plug it in to try to use it until after the 30 day return period had expired. I rate this product at zero stars.Peter RileyAroma AHP-303 Single Hot Plate, Black"
4,A good Hot Plate,I have been using this Hot Plate for several months for chemical experiments where the temperature must be closely held to a certian value for hours at a time. The thermistatically controlled switch inside the Hot Plate seems to do this quite well.
5,double hot plate,delivery was very prompt and the burner works great. I am very satisfied and would recommend this item for others to buy.
1,Hot Plate won't boil water,This hot plate looks great but will only warm water to 187 degrees in a 10 cup pot. This hot plate will not boil an egg.
3,small,"i didn't know how tiny this book is. i bought it for my dad who is a big mad fan, and he had trouble reading the text and pictures. its about a quarter the size of a mad comic!"
1,Don't Buy as an E-Book,"When I found buying the book was going to be difficult, I ordered the e-book for my Kindle. Sadly, very little of the book is easy to read on the Kindle. I guess I should have realized this, what with all the cartoons and artwork. Blowing up each cell in a comic strip isn't my idea of pleasure reading.Otherwise, if you can find the hard copy and the 60s was your ""era"" of reading Mad---the book is great."
4,This is an OK book.,"What can one say about mad magazine? I've been reading for a long time. Even though I wasn't alive in the sixties, this book portrays them fairly well. Aside from Mad About The Seventies, this currently tops the Mad Magazine Humor list. With parodies of Gilbert and Sullivan, My Fair Lady,and Lawerence of arabia, this is a must read. My favriote section was in the late sixties. Overall, Superb."
2,incomplete,"First of all many articles were only partial. Second, it is hard to read, small print,ffor anyone with poor eyesight. I needed a magnifying glass, being far sighted, even with bifocals on. And too many of the satires were in a musical foremat and I never did like reading them to the tune of whatever song they listed."
1,WAAAAAY OUT-OF-DATE & OBSOLETE AUDIO QUALITY,"This nearly 20-year old MFSL version has been supplanted by two superior audio-quality versions, one on Repertoire (still available) and a Japanese mini-sleeve K2-remastered version (now OOP).The audio quality on both the new versions is virtually identical. The Repertoire version, however, has an extra track.Link to the 2003 Repertoire remaster:Procol Harum Live: In Concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra"
2,"Decent reference, but no context","I was expecting a bit more from a book calling itself an ""Essential Guide"". The whole book is basically a collection of 15 documents taken from sources like the US state department and the IRS. They cover taxation, emigration, what to do if you get arrested and a bunch of other legalistic things relating to being abroad. Unfortunately, that's all it has: the documents. There is no commentary, so you're left reading government documents that are written like stereo instructions. About 60 of the 160 or so pages are tax instructions...basically reprints of the expat equivalent of 1040 instructions. While I haven't checked, these seem like the kind of documents that a) change relatively often and b) can be obtained for free if you need them.Bottom line: This is a good book to have on the shelf as a reference you hope to never have to use. As for providing you with a practical guide to living and working overseas, try something like the Expert Expatriate."
2,"Pleasant fluff, couldn't read another however","Don't ask me why I ended up reading this, but I like to think of myself as ""open-minded,"" so I did. It's an amusing way to spend the time. No surprises as to the plot, which could have been recycled from old MacGuyver episodes, and the mysterious clues weren't all that mysterious, but the writing is fun and airy and the two lead characters -- basically the only ones in the book -- are fun cariactures. I'm going to call this book ""mysterical"" (mystery + hysterical) and say that if you like inoffensive, pleasant, non-challenging reading it's great."
4,Amazingly fast read,"If I really thought about it, I would probably find some nits to pick with this book -- but anything that sucks me and and keeps moving forward so that I *must* keep on reading counts as a success as far as I am concern.There's an obvious take on ""The DaVinci Code"" here, combined with a bit of cyber-thriller and a ticking clock that keeps the story moving at a fairly frantic pace. The highest accolade I can bestow? I went out and bought several of Ms. Kenner's backlist as soon as I finished this one."
3,"quick, light fun","While it starts slow with a lot of character background, we're off to the races almost as soon as our third major character shows up. The action happens quickly and the puzzles are interesting while being geared for the heroine. A nice touch is that she doesn't always get things right on her first take.While I wouldn't say this is gripping action and plot twists keeping you on the edge of your seat, it is a great weekend read or a beach bum book. The characters are believeable, the story is well paced, and it doesn't get too serious even when life is on the line."
2,Not very good,"The Product Description above says that this was called ""the world's #1 archaeology blog"". If so, the others must be just awful, because this one is practically useless as a source of archaeology information. Half of the articles have little or nothing to do with archaeology. During the trial I received only one article mentioning a new discovery. I was hoping this would be a good way to keep up on what is happening in the field of archaeology, but it definitely is not."
4,The good humor just keeps going and going...,"After a good start in ""the Infantile Years"", Red Green continues to roll out the humor like an endless roll of duct tape. It really sticks to a guy."
5,Daisy,"Very disturbing content but TRUE, Every girl by age 10 should see & realize what can happen to them so easily with online predators. The movie haunted me for days and still lingers with me. Even though it is a low budget film, it was very real and the acting was RIGHT ON...."
2,"I Don't Like it, but it deserves 5 stars. But five stars means I love it, which I didn't","Very compelling shocking movie about two best friends who go missing a few weeks apart. Realistically portrayed but I can't say much more or it will give it a way. Google it after, not before like I did.I don't agree though that I would watch it with my kids. It's far too disturbing and inappropriate. However, I would recommend that teenagers watch it with some friends. I disagree that the last 22 minutes was the worst. Yes, it was awful, shocking, horrible. But realistic and you will understand why I say that after you google it.So did I like it? No, I didn't. Did the director do an excellent job and get his message across? Yes, he did. Chillingly so."
2,Yikes.,This movie really messed me up. I watched it a few months ago and am still haunted by the last 2o minutes or so. I'll never look at barrels the same way again.
1,IRRITATING GIRLS & VILE FINALE,"This is really ugly stuff folks. This 'movie' is basically just a lot of obnoxious footage of 2 irritating teenage girls making YouTube style videos calling each other 'bitches' and 'sluts''. They throw in some fake looking 'news reports' (why can't they ever get the right words at the bottom of the screen that look like the words you see on an actual news report?), and finally the last few minutes shows the fate of these irritating girls which is actually really vile. There's no gore here whatsoever but the final few minutes are vomit-inducing and I really can't believe they allowed this thing on Amazon. Curiosity seekers will get burned badly and won't be able to get some of these sick images out of their heads and TOTAL sicko / psychos now have some new masturbation material. I'm really sorry I even watched this vile crap."
1,Trash......cleverly disguised trash.,"I am an avid fan of horror, thriller, and important message movies. These are what Megan is Missing appears to be from the outside, however beneath the surface lies a disgusting mess of torture porn which destroys the intended message. This movie is meant to raise awareness of internet predators, but the last 30 minutes of the movie are so vile that any take home message is lost and you the viewer are left highly disturbed and ready to throw up. This movie is utter trash and should not be seen. BEWARE.... the unrated rating should be R or NC-17 as disturbing imagery of young girls in sexual torture devices is shown as well as a gut-wrenching and utterly vile graphic rape scene of a 13 year old is shown. This movie had potential, but lowers itself bellow slime with the approach taken.DO NOT WATCH!!!!!!!! DISTURBING AND VILE FILM."
2,Very Enthralling,"the only thing writer/director Michael Goi achieves is making Megan, 100 percent repugnant from the start. You don't care about her because he goes out of his way to present her as the kind of kid who probably deserves a good punch to knock her off her pedestal. Honestly, I was so sick of hearing her speak her petty, self-absorbed yapping, I couldn't wait for her to go missing. This is amateurish trash disguised as an ""important"" message movie.The entirety of ""Megan Is Missing"" is tough to watch -- not because of its finger-pointing, ""it could happen to you"" approach, but because it's simply dull. If you've ever wanted to see the feet of a guy as he uses a shovel to move dirt for nearly 12 minutes -- and that's no exaggeration -- this is your movie.Thanks Rod Lott"
4,Basic Textbook,It's the textbook that is described and require for the class I needed it for. It is an accurate description.
4,Sea Symphony,"Vaughan Williams' first symphony, the Sea Symphony, is a rare gem which flaunts chorus and soloists. The opening fifteen minutes or so is probably the most dramatic music ever written. The soprano soloist has a wonderfully soaring voice which is heard well above the orchestra. The baritone equally portrays his part with depth. This recording is missing one star because the orchestra covers the choir just a bit. However, Thomson wrings every drop of drama out of the brass and orchestra. This work is a must for any classical music lover!"
3,Doesn't appear to be 100% leather...,"This is OK for the money, but seems like bonded leather. Not exactly what I expected. Also no product information came - not even a warehouse name of where it came from. Will keep it because it was inexpensive but would choose something different if starting over. Also has a slight amount of damage upon arrival (dent in leather) but it we covered with a wooden tray."
2,WRITTEN IN POOR QUALITY,"This book is a poor quality black and white production. Has little about avon bottles in relationto the rest of the book, AND does not contain the entireavon bottle line like you would except.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE."
4,Great small bag,"I always prefer a non-enormous laptop bag (unlike the ugly and too-large Targus bags favored by my old job in government) and this STM Small Alley really fits the bill. It's compact, giving me room for just enough stuff but no room to overfill. Perfect for my MacBook.My only suggestions:1 - use a mesh backing on the under-the-flap deep pocket to make it easier to see what's inside it.2 - add a couple pen slots, including one accessible with the flap closed."
3,"Great bag, a little extra room than I expected","This is a great bag. Nice material and nice accessories like the cell phone holder. However, the padded area is about 3"" deep which is fine for some laptops but a sloppy fit for the Macbook 13"". You could fit two Macbooks in the laptop area! This wasted space makes the bag inefficient for thin notebook users. If you have a thicker laptop, it might be ideal.Revision; In the 2 years since I first wrote that review, i have used the bag extensively. The ""wasted space"" has not been as much an issue as I feared. Don't we always have a few extra things to carry? (a textbook, magazine, spare hard drive, binder, snack, etc?) I have seen dozens of other bags and none seem to offer the style and functionality of this bag. I highly recommend it and would increase the star rating to five."
5,"Nimble, Smooth, Awesome","It's a shame that this is the kind of group you'll never hear on terrestrial radio, except for maybe one or two college stations. I listen to a lot of satellite radio and I think I've heard them played there one time. I had to stumble across these guys on an Internet channel, and they are an amazing discovery. An excellent and swinging retro-lounge/chill/jazz-infused bossa nova sound as filtered through French pop-inflected space-age bachelor pad sensibilities. If any of that makes sense. Comparisons to Supreme Beings of Leisure, Goldfrapp, Smoke City, and Nouvelle Vague are not misguided. They have a very fun and sexy vibe and definitely show a deft and spritely touch, as it were--every thing is mixed and produced just right. Very highly recommended."
4,"Tasty, not overwhelming.","Bitter Sweet's ""The Mating Game"" is tasty, not overwhelming. The Brazillion Girls meet The Cardigans. Sweet cooing with insigtful lyrics. The usual love gone wrong with a twist. Loungy, peppy, at times bossa nova-esque. Great for a dinner party. It will set a mood of modern indulgence with a retro lounge effect. I highly reccomend this CD."
4,Fun and easy to enjoy music!!!,"First time I came across Bitter:Sweet, was after watching the movie the Devil Wears Prada. I basically loved all the music in it and was looking to buy the soundtrack originally but then did some research on each of the artists included in the album, and after listening to the amazon samplers I decided to buy each artists' album individually.I definitely am happy to be doing just that, I still have some albums left to buy..."
4,Bitter:sweet Just the way I like it,"The first week I was out in San Diego one of the radio stationsplayed a song from a group based in LA. All it took was hearingthat song one time and I went home and retrieved the album onmy Rhapsody account. I knew after hearing the whole album I'deventually buy the CD, which I did. Do I think everyone will lovethis group's music? No, but for me the mix of big band and alternative (along the lines of Portishead or Cranberries) issoothing to my musical soul. If you aren't sure, listen to'the Mating Game.' I'll bet you'll get the album."
4,Great CD,This is a great CD. Her voice is smooth and airy and the horns add a great contrast. Astonishing beats!
4,Groovy sounds abide!,"It's difficult to categorize this infectious mix of Thievery Corporation-groove beats, MMW-ish funk, John Barry-esque 60's sweeping orchestra, Portishead-like vocals and sampling, etc., etc..Listen to above Amazon soundbites, but songs develop into much more than those snapshots.Title track is strong, but ""Dirty Laundry"" is great, then ""Overdue"" segues nicely into ""Heaven"".It just seems to end up in my CD player a lot!"
5,I honestly can't say enough ...,"Living in Arizona, I had never heard of Bitter:Sweet. I found out another performer, Natalie Walker, who I'm a fan of was playing in Hollywood so I bought tickets. I saw that she was playing with Bitter:Sweet so I decided to check out their music to see what I was in for. All I could get my hands on before the show was the three or four songs they had featured on MySpace but I immediately fell in love with those songs. Dirty Laundry quickly became one of my favorites. I went to the show and I have to tell you, I was simply blown away. Floored. I had never witnessed a live show as amazing as that.Here, a month later, I still can't stop listening to The Mating Game CD and keep hoping that they'll venture out to Arizona soon. The sound that this duo provides is so sensual, so fun, so energetic, so moving. This CD takes you on an emotional roller coaster that is pleasant the whole way through."
1,Not what I expected.,"This book was published in 1979, and I could not find a description of it's contents anywhere. I was hoping that it would be a book on wire sculpture, as used in jewelry, household objects, etc. Instead, it's a book on how to do ""String Art"" type art using wire. Definitely not what I was looking for. Hopefully this information will help you to decide if this book is what you are looking for....."
3,Alright book,They sent me a different edition than what I order so I was a little mad about that but i was still able to use it for class.
4,some real gems in here,"Jesse, their take on ""you win again"" and their bluegrass breakdowns are all really worth a listen. They came out back in the Flying Burrito Bros days and Rockfish Crossing got played a lot. Pick your way through this and I'm sure you'll find something you'll want to keep. (I ignore the 'jesus' song)"
2,Perfect for my Microwave Night Light - Update - Poor performance,"I bought this as a replacement for my microwave nightlight. The microwave has two settings: Work and Night Light, each with a different bulb.This bulb screwed right in and is exactly as described in the product description. I am happy with how easy it was to buy from Amazon!Update: I bought this bulb on November 29, 2011. As of March 10, 2012 the bulb has burned out. This gave it a lifetime of about 3 months, which is poor performance. I have downgraded the review from 5 stars to 2 accordingly."
1,disappointed,"it didn't fit my dryer, even though the description said it should. Since it was only a few bucks I didn't want to waste anymore money returning it so I just throw it in the junk drawer, maybe it will come in handy someday. I did find that a night light bulb works in my dryer and I got 4 of those for the same price."
2,Runs big,Item runs big. I used the chart to figure out the correct size but what corresponds to an xl should really be a size m.I had to give all of the tee shirts away to someone bigger...Otherwise the item is good quality and great value for the price .
2,Shrunk alot and thin,"I was surprised that after I washed them, they shrunk alot and were thin. We bought them for t-shirt painting and wished they were a little heavier. I bought Hanes Smalls at the local Target and they were much thicker. These shrunk smaller than the Smalls and they were washed together! They are good if you want something thin under a dress shirt but when washed, lost shape and got very small."
2,Too small,"I ordered the size small, 6-8 for my slender 7 yo for a class project. The shirt was way too small. I might fit a 4 yo who is slender. Size up if you decide to buy this."
1,ocean breezes,"I was very dissapointed. I expected to see beautiful ocean scenes and landscapes,with music that was more soothing."
2,Deceptive description.,"Corsair makes great memory products, but very misleading reseller listing.Product shows 2 Dimms (2x2GB), but it's actually 4 Dimms(4x1GB).The micro atx mobo I was using only has 2 ddr2 slots with 4GB max, so this memory would not allow for 4Gb since this comes in a 4 piece kit."
1,Xpensive memory for the amount,Be sure to install a 64-bit capable OS to get full use of this ram. Or u can put 2 sticks in one PC and the other two sticks in another PC.
2,Learn Chinese,"This book is useful only if you are taking a Chinese class, not if you are trying to learn on your own."
1,Why buy a character book?,"I bought this book years ago because it was on one of these Amazon lists, and when I got it, I couldn't figure out what to do with it. Because I was learning Chinese in university, I didn't have a shortage of materials like dictionaries. Then why ""bei danzi"" / memorize single characters? That's the way Chinese study English in college, which is why it's so tough for them. No. Take the ""read, write, speak, listen"" approach. I guess if you're learning to write all by yourself you might need something like this. I don't know."
1,not a useful book,"No more than a list of characters, with little or no usage guidance, and unusable as a dictionary."
3,Same problems as traditional version: Index riddled with errors,"The first entry I looked up in the index, 'xiang(1,4)', was listed as being on p 368 but in reality was on p 386. Pretty bad for a reference book, where being able to look things up is kind of important. Looks like they learned nothing from publishing the original, traditional characters, version. That index was also error-ridden.This could've been a very useful book if they had hired an editor or even a proofreader. Shameful job."
5,Excellent study guide,I have been using this study guide for 2 weeks now and am finding it very thoughtfully structured and presented. My only small criticism is that many of the examples given for common words are not the most obvious examples of the word used in everyday speech....but this is not a criticism as the author provides so many good examples for each word anyway.
3,"usefull, but not that usefull","The book is compiled well for doing what it sets out to do, teaching simple characters and building them into more difficult ones. However, this is not a very focussed or practical way to learn Chinese. The book purports to be some form of self sustaining textbook, but offers no grammar, no dialougues and very little of anything else. Only two compounds out of hundreds are given for each character in this book and the definitions are also lacking. The book could be used as a psuedo dictionary but unfortunately is neither organized into themed sections nor equipped with an English definition > Chinese definition index. On a more positve note, It could be very usefull for looking up character stroke order, providing that one already has a general idea of what the character looks like and its exact hanyu pinyin. Buy it if a supplementary textbook seems necessary, it's certainly less unwieldy than many dictionaries."
2,Mediocre Job,"This book is not very useful apart from checking the stroke order. Apart from the stroke order, each Hanzi is accompanied by several combinations in which it appears. BUT: it has poor and inconsistent information about the origins and meanings of characters, doesn't give you mnemonics or any suggestions on remebering a character, or doesn't even tell you what radicals/components a certain hanzi consists of and where you can find them in the book. Don't waste your money."
4,Worth waiting for,"Glad I waited for this new edition to come out, rather than settling for the older version. A great reference and study tool. Armed with this book plus my trusty dictionary, I am ready to face unknown words."
5,ideal for the mandarin student,"I've bought my chinese textbooks in my struggle to learn mandarin, and this has been the best one by far. By explaining the origin of the words, and linking the characters to images, it shapes a jumble of hieroglyphics into recognizable symbols, even mnemonics."
3,"cheap books, cheap logos","Book is ok. small logos, not the most innovative. Basically you get what you pay for."
5,Tons of Designs,Lots of pictures of different logos and the book is arranged in a very orderly manner. Excellent book!
3,Thirty short stories...,"*** Thirty stories in all. The author seems to be infatuated with dead rock stars and mourning fans, Valentino, love-at-first-sight, and ghosts. Each story is about five pages long. Some end wonderfully, some awful and depressing, and some just leave you wondering.My advice is not to read this book in one sitting. It has a better impact to the reader if only two or three stories are read at each sitting. A good, light read. ***Reviewed by Detra Fitch."
2,Quality Control Poor,"The plays are excellent, exactly as I had hoped and remembered from the original TV broadcasts. My set, however, arrived with a defective copy of ""The Tempest."" Although the disc was free of mars or scratches, ACT III is corrupted and unplayable on any of several machines. Despite Ambrose's assurance that they will replace damaged discs, my emails have gone unanswered."
5,No Measure for Measure?,"The BBC Shakespearean plays are by far the best done that I've seen. I viewed nearly all of these in my two semesters of Shakespeare classes at university. However, I can't understand why Measure for Measure would be left out of these. Tim Pigott-Smith was superb as Angelo! Overall this is a fantastic deal on the plays that are available. They are terribly difficult to find and of highest quality."
5,An As You Like It that's just Mozartean,"The actors really bring the language to life, and you can actually hear it. Helen Mirren as Rosalind in As You Like just reduced me to a puddle. She can, in just a few words, bring you to that Shakespearean/Mozartean heart that is so intense, so transparent, so tender. A transcendent performance."
5,The Power of Approachability,"Ever read a book that is FUN and you are learning at the same time??? That you actually feel that you are having a one on one conversation with the author, and learning along the way? I consider myself a very good networker, (I love people-that helps!) but I really learned so much from this book! I totally LOVE the 50 questions you can use to engage a conversation! No more-boring weather questions.... This is an inexpensive ""course"" in increasing our relationship portfolio! Our network impacts our net worth-this book will increase your net worth if you read it and take to heart and actually try some of his ideas and be open to his philosophies. Karen S. Hoffman, Founder www.cityofexperts.com"
5,"Like ""Crime and Punishment"" but for sales.","This book changed my life. I never knew how unaproachable I was until I read Scott's book. After implementing the sage stratagies of this modern day master of human/commercial relationships, I find that people are no longer afraid to approach me(when I'm selling them things). The light verbal cajoleing I recive at parties for wearing a name tag, or the odd looks I get when I wear my name tag out to dinner with freinds i've known for years are a small price to pay indeed. Thank you scott."
3,Revell,"Revell has really gone down hill in their newer products. This is not well made. My product box came in crushed. Parts inside were fine, but not a ""good"" $20 scale down kit. I have built for years. This took a lot of additional labor time to get the excess plastic off the parts. Feels checper then previous Revell products. Little disappointed. Price is up, quality is down."
2,"Better Than Two Bungee Cords, But Get the Delta QuickBag Instead","1. Plastic hooks can and do fall off. Replaced the hooks with metal carabiners but they rattled.2. Netting comes undone after continued stretching3. Delta Mega Rack Post Haste (I bought the net to use with the rack) lacks four secure hook points to secure the net4. Takes too long to attach. Like bungee cords, you have to wrap/stretch/fidget for a few minutes before each ride to attach the net securely to the rackI've been using the Delta QuickBag for two weeks. Yes, you have to limit your cargo to a bag the size of a large toaster, but now its ""Press Click Click"" to attach and ""Click Click Rip (of the Velcro)"" to detach. Quick. Easy. Secure. Quiet. Worry-Free. Just what I had wanted to accomplish in the first place!Delta QuickBag Bicycle Rack Bag (Rack Not Included)"
1,"Nice idea in concept, but...","I bought one of these last week for carrying things on the back of my bike (I have a carrier mounted over the rear wheel). As one of the other reviewers noted, the four hooks aren't permanently attached to the bungee, there's just a smaller hook where the cord holds it. That might be a good thing, if it gives you more flexibility in moving the hooks. But in my case, as I was riding, I heard a ""boing"" sound and one of the hooks went flying off somewhere. So I returned the cargo net to the store. If the hooks were permanently attached instead, I'd say this was a great product."
3,Good but failed on me,"I bought this item a few months ago and liked it. I ride about 2 miles with my cargo. I keep the net on my bike always as I don't know when I will need it. The reason for my low score is one of the clamps must have broken. The entire net got wound around the back sprocket of my bike. It took an hour to get it unwound and the net is useless now. I am ordering another one to see if I have the same issue. Up to that point the product was sound but I didn't like walking my bike through some of the areas I had to to get home. It is not expensive so give it a try, but test it first. Amazon has a great return policy."
4,Delta Mega Rack Bicycle Cargo Net,"Net is sturdy & well made. Hooks are strong & don't scratch. It works pretty well at holding in most things I've tried. Still it was a bit expensive & the Amazon vendor gouged a bit on the shipping charges, I think."
2,A Question Of Strength And Durability,"I purchased the Delta Mega Rack Bicycle Cargo Net as recommended by Amazon.com along with theDelta Mega Rack Post Haste Bicycle Seat Post Rackfor use on my mountain bike. After much trial and error in figuring a way to secure my gear bag, containing as its heaviest item a quart bottle of Gatorade, I found the only method that prevented the entire bag from tipping over the side of the rack was for the bottle to be placed as far forward as possible, turned around so the thickest part, the bottom, was forward, and the forward edge of the cargo net's cords were wrapped double around the bottle. But I noticed this put a great strain on the cords and they were already starting to fray from my efforts, and together with the limitations of the rack itself, as I pointed out in its own review, I was forced to return both items."
4,"Not Fancy, but all we need","Not much to say here, they're napkins. They aren't the fanciest of them all, but they do what they need to do."
5,brown Seventh Generation napkins,"These aren't the only environmentally friendly napkins on the market but they are the only brown colored ones that I know of. Besides the color, I really like the fact that they don't stick together--I can pull them one at a time from my napkin holder. I highly recommend this product.Seventh Generation Lunch Napkins, Natural, 1-Ply Sheets, 500-Count Packages (Pack of 12)"
3,"Nice stories, bad plays.","Although, as always, the stories are a very nice read, they don't come accross as plays. Only one of the three plays would be managable on stage, and even then difficult for an audience. The other two are nearly impossible. Still a nice read though."
2,OK,"I was glad to find a copy of this book containing the play I wanted to read. It arrived in timely fashion. It is in decent condition.To Amazon:WHY DO YOU FORCE THIS REVIEWING PROCESS SO STRONGLY? TO MY WAY OF THINKING, NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS. I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE TO SPEND TIME DOING THIS. EXCELLENT NEWS AND REALLY BAD NEWS MAKES MOST SENSE."
3,We agree....,"What the other reviewer wrote about the sound is true, but we bought it to be white noise for our baby and it's been wonderful for that and humidity."
2,"It works, but wow is it noisy","I saw that this unit had a reasonable-sized fan and two speed settings, so I thought it might be pretty quiet. But the two settings turn out to be ""loud"" and ""ear-splitting"", if you plan to use this thing in a bedroom or other non-industrial setting.This flaw is unfortunate, he rest of the humidifier is pretty nice.. easy filling and cleaning, nice appearance."
4,"Maybe a better title would have been, ""How to know you are angry when you're parenting.""","The jewel that is this book is that it raises our awareness of how we may feel and act when we're angry, and shows us how we may use these feelings properly in our parenting. If you want to know how to tell when you're parenting from a place of anger (rationalized, justified, or otherwise) instead of a place of love, this may be the right book for you."
2,Kid Cooperation is MUCH better,"Cold, too analytical and no practical means of employing the changes he suggests except to just 'do it'. Bought this book and Kid Cooperation which I found to be clear, common sense, multiple-option resource for you and your child. Only a few things I don't agree with, such as not rewarding good grades (money). It's helped me a great deal to quit fighting with my 13 y/o and I see immediate changes in his behavior when I employ her suggestions. Much more useful."
4,a ok,I got really good service and it was done quickly and efficiently. Thanks for putting up good products for the homeschool families. WA Mom
3,"""Timber"" bear","The bear is soft and cuddly. However does not sit up by itself, which makes it less of a decoratuve toy."
3,loved it until...,...the plastic piece covering the air pump nozzle broke off :(*lasted about 1 month until it broke*horn is EXTREMELY LOUD*very easy to fill up*get about 20 REAL HONKS per fill up
5,"Big sound, small horn","This horn is ""holy crap"" loud! A friend of mine has a smaller version of this same horn from the same company, but mine is slightly bigger and louder. My horn echoed in my neighborhood. It's that loud. Since I'm a ""roadie"", I mounted this horn on the left bar where the lower position bend is so I can hit the horn while up or down on the bars, and still hit the brake at the same time. The bottle can pretty much mount wherever you want. And, the air tube has lots of length so it can be attached however you want. This IS the best bicycle safety horn available. If you bike on the streets and don't get this horn, you are at risk!Update***December 2, 2011I was out riding near dusk today in downtown Sacramento, CA. My riding buddy and I were constantly having to use our horns to be noticed. There were many times where drivers were pulling-out in front of us while we were doing ~20 mph. This horn IS a life saver!"
5,loud,"This horn blows me away ! It's loud , disrespectful close to pedestrians, but the one's that take the whole bike path listening to their IPOD and walking their dog get to hear it and they really move out of the way.It's really effective and gets the attention of annoying car drivers on intersections not seeing you. It may have saved my life already. Its a great lightweight invention, easy to install, refills with free air. I put it on my drink holder and routed the horn and hose to the handlebar. This is a great product for commuters and city riders, go get it !"
5,Delta Airzound bike horn,"If you want a horn that can be heard in traffic or inside cars with radios blasting and cell phones in use, this is for you. I don't advise careless use because this horn is LOUD. But when you need to get someone's attention it is a lifesaver.Highly recommeded."
4,"Great horn, let down by low quality handlebar clip","The horn is as good as most of the reviews point out - loud, simple to use etc. The one negative for me is that the clip to hold it on the handlebars is pretty cheap and nasty, and too small to use on my chunky mountain bike handlebars. I'd rather pay a few dollars more and get a nice flexible velcro & soft rubber strap that fits on & off quickly onto any tube size, as I got with my (admittedly expensive) Cateye lights (which are great btw)."
4,nice and loud,"Plus: volume. Minus: designed for straight handle bars not drop bars. A must have for any cyclist who has to fend off clueless car drivers. Car drivers don't seem to realize that cyclists are traveling anywhere from 10 - 30 mph and therefore always seem to think they can make a turn in front of you. Well, not anymore if you got this horn. If one of these unconscious drivers looks like they might cut you off just give them a little toot and they'll be frozen in their tracks. As far as the other comments about pedestrians; pedestrians always have the right of way (on the streets and the trails) so do a little positive PR for cycling as a sport and stop for them, smile, say hi and then proceed."
2,"Loud, but tricky to install","Came already charged with air, which quite surprised me. Plenty loud enough. Fits in a bottle cage or to its own frame mounted velcro fastener. Fitting of the horn to the handlebar is a little tricky, as it seems to require removing the handlebar grip (immerse in boiling water) and brake lever to slide the horn over the end of the handlebar, and then refit components.Edit: This horn broke after just a few refills. The valve / trigger ruptured. Shame as its a nice idea."
5,fantabulous!,"I not only use this while on my bike, but in general as an ""annoying person/thing deflector"". It's great at parties, walking around downtown, in the library, just about anywhere! You're sure to be the hit of any gathering with this thing!On a serious note, this thing is LOUD and awesome. It's my new Burningman toy!"
2,"Good horn, terrible attachment system","Pros:* The horn is extremely loud, loud enough to get any driver's attention. It has already helped avoid me getting run off the road twice in only a handful of outingsCons:* TERRIBLE attachment mechanisms. The clamp for the horn part is completely worthless. I ended up attaching it with more zip ties. The velcro attachment for the air bottle is a little better, but still allows for the bottle to move around too much. I used some gaff tape to hold it more steady.* The air hose is too long and tends to just get in the way.* It's too easy to accidentally sound the horn."
5,That's what I call loud!,"The best bike horn on the market. It's really LOUD. Be careful when using it indoors because your ears will hurt. You can easily refill it with air with your bike pump :)Great product, especially if you ride your bike in big noisy cities like New York. This horn is a true safety feature because car drivers can notice you easier when hearing the honk."
3,"pretty good product, perhaps a bit misleading.","Greetings,The horn is effective and does add to ones safety on the road.However, I did not see any mention of or picture of the goofy air bottle that comes with it and must be mounted to the bike frame. It is pretty big and significant to the design to the degree that i'm sure they purposefully omitted it from the piks to improve ""accidental"" sales. I would not have purchased this horn if I saw the goofy AIR bottle. Also, my bike is orange. The fact that it had orange trim in the picture sealed the deal for me. The Product shipped without any orange trim at all, just grey and white.... no huge deal, but misleading.I'd send it back but it is quite loud and effective...... dunno what I will do.PS: I filled it up this morning, used it for 4 short beeps today, now it is empty. I will check tonight to see if it was pilot error somehow.TW"
2,Great -at first - but doesn't hold up,"I really liked this horn at first. It was exactly what I needed in traffic to get drivers' attention (not for pedestrians!). I used it for a while, but eventually the actuator button failed - when I pressed the button to actuate the horn, it just caused air to leak out of the pressurized bottle with no horn sound. When I contacted the company with this problem, they were not helpful. Overall, cheaply made and unreliable. replaced it with an electronic horn."
5,Fantastic for Biking in City,"This is a great add on device for biking on city streets. It can be heard by trucks, busses, etc. Very light weight. If I don't use it much can go weeks on a fill.While it has a ""volume control,"" it's tricky to adjust. It's usually too loud for other settings like parks or beach."
5,Be heard on the road,"I am a car-free cyclist. I love it, but some people are careles or think I have no right to the road. This horn is loud and makes these people think. Use it like a car horn, only when needed.It's light, easy to use and it's loud.Being plasic, it may not last long.Bicycle for health, earth and our children's future."
5,Better than expected,"It has a simple design that is well thought out and produced. Very light, easy to install, and plenty loud enough. I'm really glad I got it."
5,"Great product , improves safety when riding a bicycle as daily transport",Easy to installGreat for safety ( and fun )Seems to last for years.
4,Bike Airhorn-Delta Airzound,Good sound-- also repells aggressive dogs. I use it on a terra trike A must in high car traffic situations-- recommended B.B.
5,For Emergency Use Only,"Just received this horn, filled to 80 psi with my electric pump and installed. This thing is loud. It does,as one review said, sound like a Mack Truck on helium. Years ago I almost had a dog take me down on a motorcycle and have been afraid or riding near dogs ever since, so this is to scare the dogs. I have only used it one other time and that was today when a car was backing out of a drive way and did not see me. Use it seldomly or you will be a very unpopular person.PS. Does not work on ""Deaf"" dogs."
1,Mine Didn't Last,"I bought this a year ago, it worked well for a few months but then began to leak slowly. Eventually, it did not hold pressure for more than an hour.Threw it away."
4,Commuter must have,"Read previous reviews as well as online blog reviews, and this horn kept coming up...So glad I got it. Just got it, so haven't had to use it yet, but it's so LOUD that I'm sure we will be heard when needed. I pull my kids in a trailer & wanted whatever I needed to be safe while biking. This horn is a must have for anyone biking in traffic. I only wish the bottle fit better on my Electra Townie 7d; but, thats more of a fatter frame, and I have the frame bag in the way....I've already recommended this horn to friends. Love that you can refil it!!!"
1,One Falling Star,"Bought it, tried it, and returned it.Yes, it is loud, but that is all I can say good of it.The clamp design is poor. I could not get it to fit on the handle bar of my bike. An easier to install clamp that is more adjustable is needed. If you only have one water bottle carrier on your bike, it is difficult to find an acceptable location for the air reservior. The supply line from the air reservoir to the horn did not appear to be able to be shortened. The volume control is not easily accessed. Overall it is cheaply made and I doubt that it would last more than one biking season."
4,Plenty loud! Great product,This hoirn is LOUD but has an adjustable volume dial that essentially limits the amount air flow through the tube which cuts the volume considerably. I use this on a motorized bicycle and it's perfect to warn cars about to run me off the road or to gain their attention when going through intersections. I love the fact you can just pump it up when it gets low on air instead of buying expensive air cartridges or other repeat purchase item. Great product.
5,Airzound Bike Horn,"After being run over a second time in 12 months at a roundabout, it occurred to me that visuals (lights, reflective jacket, etc) weren't enough... I needed noise and I was put onto the Airzound bike horn. This is one AWESOME piece of cycling artillary, and it has saved my bacon more than once since acquiring it. Whenever I think a car is going to cut in or hasn't seen me, a blast of this horn and they hit the skids, looking for the semi-trailer. In fact, a semi-trailer gave me a blast for taking right-of-way at a roundabout and my blast WAS LOUDER!Also this horn is a breeze to maintain. You just use the same pump as the tyres. I top it up once a week when I check the tyres... unless I have given someone a REAL BLAST."
4,Super LOUD! A bit bulky to mount on Catrike.,"I mounted this on my Catrike Road, I made it work, but the bottle does take up room. Small price to pay for something that could save your life. As others have said, this is not for pedestrians, it will scare the crap out of them and could get you in a fight. If people are your main concern, buy a ding dong bell. If cars and trucks are your issue, get this. The unit hold air very well. It came shipped with air in it, and I have not added any yet. I think that is amazing!"
4,Poor mounting only fault of otherwise great product,"Overall this is a great product. Very loud (if rather high-pitched,) and charging with a bike pump is an awesome concept. The only real problem is with the horn mount. For starters, the ring clamp is attached to the rest of the unit by - get this - a zip tie. I'm not talking about mounting to the bike using zip ties, which is pretty common practice. No, the airzound itself is held together using a zip tie! Additionally the trigger placement make the horn want to rotate when you place it, which means it has to be clamped down particularly tight. But until someone comes along and fixes these issues, this is still a great bike horn."
3,Great Design - High Performance,"I find this horn very well designed, but since I cannot use it now (it sounds only when I pump it, not when I push the button) I cannot give it 5 stars. I was able to fix it first time it happened, but cannot figure it out now, no troubleshooting instructions provided. The idea is great, it is loud enough for the cars.Addition: I figured out that I did not get enough air, now it works great! It is a must for the NYC road biking when cars do not obey traffic laws."
3,loud horn,This is a very loud horn the only thing that I did't like about this item is that the air run out to fast other then that it's ok God Bless.
3,Great when it works,"This horn was fabulous while it worked - I had it mounted on my handlebars and it saved my life several times.Unfortunately it mysteriously went silent after a couple of years and any attempts to fix it have failed. It wasn't damaged - one day it worked and the next time I went to use it, it didn't. Am hoping for a replacement from the manufacturer but so far it's not forthcoming despite my numerous requests. Not good service."
2,Does NOT work in the cold!,Don't buy this if you are going to be riding in any temperature less than 30 degrees F. It's useless. The horn sound goes from a stout *PHOOOOOOOOOORNK!* to a plaintive *wheet?* It's a known problem that the company admits they can't solve. I'm returning it.
5,Scare people!,This product is awesome. Really awesome. I had a plastic flower on my bike as decoration and a truck full of construction workers started yelling at and mocking me when we were stopped at a red light in downtown chicago. I then turned and honked with my Airzound bike horn and scared the crap out of them. It was worth it just for that but otherwise.... this thing turns heads!
5,VERY LOUD!!!,This is the best horn you can buy hands down! It is so loud no one will be able to say they couldn't hear you cause it is loud enough to blow your eardrums. Well worth the money and easy to mount.
1,Good Idea but JUNK,"The horn IS loud. BUT the way it mounts to your bike is GARBAGE!. ONE bump, literally one, and the mounting point on the horn broke off! AND, to add injury to insult, the jagged remainder cut my leg!. I have a road bike, I'm not going off jumps, or down-hilling, nothing extreme by any nature. Good idea, but this product is made cheaper than a Chinese McDonald's Happy meal toy. Depending how often you ride your bike this thing WILL break in a relatively short amount of time. I ride my bike everyday, and mine lasted one week...good luck to those that decide to purchase this horn - just get a bell"
3,"Easy to install and use, and very loud! But clunky.","The Airzound lives up to its billing as ""the world's loudest bike horn."" Don't test it inside -- as I did. I don't think my 4-year-old has forgiven me yet. And it is easy to install, use and maintain -- a few pumps to the horn when I'm filling my tires is all I've ever needed.My problem is that I haven't found a comfortable place to mount the air bottle. The down-tube on my bike is occupied with a water bottle/cage, so I mounted the air bottle on the top tube. If I mount it near the front, my knees hit it. If I mount it near the rear of the tube, I rub it with my thighs.I eventually took the horn off my bike and I'm more comfortable. But I'm sure I'll miss it someday, when I try to yell at an oblivious driver. Because man, this horn is LOUD!!!"
5,Bike Air Horn,"If you want to be heard then this is the bike horn for you ! Its extremely loud, very easy to mount on your bike. The quality is very well made. You won't be disappointed. Just remember , you will need an air source, either an air compressor or air pump to fill with compressed air. Maximum pressure is 80 PSI. However, 60 to 65 PSI will work fine."
1,Delta Airzound Bike Horn,"After bleeding off the the initial air, I could not get it re-pressurized usingeither a floor pump or a bike pump returned waiting for new one to come"
1,Junk,stupid lasts for 30 seconds i pressed it 2 time and thats it. please do not buy this item. get the electric one.
1,Piece of junk,"OK, it's loud. Other than that, I think I wasted my money.A good whistle is cheeper and fail proof.Here are the problems:1. Schraeder valve stem. I have Presta valve tires, I don'twant to carry another pump or convert the Presta pump toSchraeder everytime I need to pump the thing up.2. After bleeding off the the initial air, I could not get it re-pressurized usingeither a floor pump or a bike (frame) pump. The problem, again, is thevalve stem being too short to fit into my pump."
3,"Sound as promised, poor latching mechanism","I have been using the airzound for over a month now cummuting through Nashville. The sound projected by the horn is fantastic. It has afforded me the attention of some of the most reckless, gas-guzzling drivers in the world. (I digress..) Works well at clearing geese off the road, (sorry guys!) The air-recharging mechanism is great, works well even with CO2 inflators.The problem I would point out is the shoddy mechanism by which the horn is latched to the bike. The plastic tab on mine broke going over a minor bump. Bummer. I have secured it with quick-ties, but I consider the latching mechanism a design flaw."
4,Great product.,Makes your presence known to half blind drivers who don't seem to see bicyclists. Easy to recharge. A real good investment in cycling safety.
5,Deafeningly Loud ...as much as a car horn,"If you use this horn, be sure you have a mobile hand airpump on your bike, as this horn gets unfilled quite easilyafter 10 uses during traveling, because it operates onair pressure. If you honk, you lose air, and that's normal.Refilling it takes 2 mins, and you're back on your way.It's EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE. On a bike path, even 4 seconds ofhonking, gets joggers OUT OF THE WAY, and those walkingtheir dog TURN THEIR HEADS AROUND, and others walkingMOVE OVER TO THE GRASS, OFF THE PATH, as needed.It's just an incredible horn!As for durability, it needs to be protected from abuse...don't damage it, just be careful not to do anything unusual.It takes some getting used to, at first, due to the bulkybottle, but I've found it's easy to ignore after a few rides,with the velcro attachment, just behind the handle-bars ona road bike."
5,Great for any age,I picked up my copy of this book at a charity auction to help rescue special needs dogs. I'm well past the age group this book was aimed at 56 this Sunday but ever since reading this book the last think I say to mt dogs every night after the lights are off is calling each one by name and saying I will always love you. My dogs are fast becoming seniors and we just never know when we may say goodbye.
3,"sweet book, but flawed","This was a very sweet book, but I agree with the other reviewer who said that if your child didn't tell her dog that she loved him every single day, it can lead to tears and misunderstandings. I flinched when I read that part aloud, and then had to explain to my daughter that we showed our dog how much we loved him every day by taking such good care of him and loving on him. I think she accepted it, but I would hate for her to feel guilty because of the way this book worded it. I also didn't like that it downplayed everyone else's feelings about the dog, like mentioning that the siblings loved him, but not as much as the little boy. We all loved our sweet dog, and we are all feeling the grief. It was a good concept, but missed the mark, IMO."
1,Don't buy this book for a grieving child!,"We bought 5 books from Amazon to explain death to our small child. This book is the reason we bought 5. If my daughter read this book she would be more upset because she didn't tell him she loved him ""EVERY DAY""! The way a small child will interpret these things are not the way we adults see it. I put it in the trash."
2,Why does the dog get fat?,"Although I agree with the many reviewers who found the sentiment expressed in this book to be poignant and comforting, I found this book disturbing. The main canine character grows up from a puppy to become an extremely overweight dog. Yet, there is no indication in the book that obesity is an avoidable condition or that it was detrimental to the dog's health to be overweight. Obviously this book was not intended to be a book about proper animal care, I get that. But if the author was not going to address the dog's obesity in any way, why was it such a prominent element in the story? Inadvertently, the author sends the message to children that dogs get fat and we can't do anything about it. As a person who works in animal welfare, I am uncomfortable with that message."
5,Great for Saying Goodbye,"I got this book to help my daughter deal with the loss of our dog who had become sick and had to be put down. I liked the way the book was to the point and very sweet at the same time. The book also stays away from taking a religious stand point which I was greatful for. My daughter is too young to have to deal with that aspect of life or death. This book teaches that sometimes something you love will go away forever, but even though they are gone, you can always love and remember them."
3,Not so good for very little children,"This book was very sad and not very comforting for a 3 year old, maybe okay for older children. Very sad"
1,Never shipped,"The seller said that this item was shipped on Oct. 2nd. The USPS tracking number indicates only that notification of an expected package(label request)took place. The package was never received at a postal facility and there is absolutely nothing to substantiate the claim that it was indeed mailed. On October 25th I received an email inviting me to review the book. Since I paid for something that was never shipped, my review was naturally not a positive one. I promptly received a rude, snotty message from the seller, but fortunately also a refund. I'm sure I would have enjoyed this book, so the one star does not reflect on the item but rather on the transaction which was not at all professional or pleasant."
3,good book!,I am starting altered books & building a library of instuctional texts. I am glad I added this one. Some good ideas & easy to understand techniques. The pyramid book is really great~ You won't be sorry you added this one to your library!
3,Not what I expected,"Although the talent of the artists who contributed to this book is without question, the book comes across more as a presentation of the artwork and artist, and less so as a teaching or how-to guide for us. I also thought the techniques used were a little out there and impractical, compared to the other altered book literature I have and have heard of."
3,An opportunity gone sour,"I am an avid altered book artist, and was excited to see a book with this title. However, it disappointed immediately. Taking three separate subjects and making them ""one soup"" is not the way to gain my support for this editor. Each medium stands firmly on its own ground and should be given their own ""due,"" rather than a hodge-podge of quick publishing.While I admire all of the artists' work, and their various areas of experise, this is not the way I would like to see them exhibited.I would be ever so pleased to see more publishers and other editors find more interesting ways for me to spend my money. ""Out of Bounds"" by Elizabeth Badurina and ""Altered Art Books"" by Kerrie Carbary, both self-published, far exceed this attempt at promoting the art of altering a book. I recommend these instead and at comparable prices."
2,Very Technical,"This book was probably good if you were a scientist, otherwise you will get lost.Some of the information was easy to follow, but overall this was a bit too over the top technical."
3,"Fine performances, but not the best","Bryden Thomson is a fine conductor, the problem is he's not quite up to the level of Adrian Boult. However, it seems the Boult 'Partita' is not conveniently available on CD's. The 'Partita' is probably VW's greatest work, aside maybe from the 8th symphony itself. Having listened to it now a couple of times, I find Thomson excessively aggressive, too much presto, and in general not ""there"" in the Vaughan Williams idiom.I just heard Richard Hickox doing the 3rd and I liked it a lot. I get the feeling he's more in tune with VW than Thomson.Undoubtedly, the Chandos sound is light-years ahead of the Bould discs. So if that's the important thing, get the Chandos."
5,Love the smell,"OK, so I am a bit strange but have always liked this smell. Product is great. just takes a small amount for a big lather."
4,I like it a lot!,"When I was young, my mom used to bathe us with pine tar soap. Call me crazy, but we weren't bothered by mosquitoesmuch! Maybe they didn't like the smell, either way, we could play outside for hours! She also used it to wash ourhair, needless to say, we NEVER contacted head lice! So pine tar does serve it's purpose in some aspects! Pros: ifthe mosquitoes hate the smell, maybe you won't get bitten and with the high rate of West Nile, what have you got to lose! Cons: the smell takes some getting used to!! Note: not for hot dates/job interviews!"
5,Cured my pregnancy rash!!!!!,"I used this soap after breaking out in a rash my OBGYN could not identify. After countless sleepless nights of severe itching, I searched online for some relief. I found good reviews of this product and decided to give it a shot. It worked wonders!!! Within days, the rash that covered my chest and belly was completely gone. I couldn't believe it. I highly recommend this product to any mommy to be that suffers from rashes."
2,Not that good,"Smell is a bit woody, but I do not think it works better then coal tar shampoo. Coal Tar shampoos tend to have a better smell"
3,Not as sharp as expected.,"This is a large and heavy lens with lots of features. It appears to be well constructed. I have only taken a few photos with it, but so far it isn't as sharp as expected. The photos were taken on a tripod with very little chance of excessive vibration. The Vibration Reduction was turned on and the shutter speed was fast. The purchase price is a LOT of money to spend on something that doesn't produce perfectly sharp photos. I am using it on my D300 for nature photography.Update 12-31-10I stand by my earlier review. For those who think I'm using the lens improperly: The lens instructions say to use the vibration reduction either on or off a tripod. The image sharpness is basically the same on the tripod whether I use VR or not. I still feel it is just a bit substandard."
5,totally functional,"My son has used this basket for 2 months and even though this basket isn't as beautiful as other more expensive moses baskets, it does the same job. The foam padding is soft and fits the basket safely - no gaps but it does extend above the top of the basket a little. The basket and handles are sturdy. This is a nice basket for those that don't want to spend so much."
2,get a better one,we got this as a baby boy gift and it was a real dissapointment. the liner is very flimsy- and doesnt even fit the basket properly- we are going to return it and get a better one.
5,My dog can't live without them...,"These are a huge hit! My dog loves peanut butter these are a healthy version of his favorite thing, he loves these treats! He can't eat just one!"
5,Long time favorite!!,"I used to get these for my dog years ago. She is picky about everything but she always used to live these. I stopped seeing them for a while, then came across them on amazon and had to order them. She was so excited and so was our new dog. They both love these treats!!"
2,Oder was received in one piece......,"I placed an order for 3 bags of Vitakraft yogurt drops--3 of chocolate, 3 of vanilla and 3 of peanut butter. The orders came from two different places and shipping from each source. The vanilla drops were cancelled because their inventory was wrong. The peanut drops came first in one box but the contents of this shipment arrived in one box but each package was stuck together to be one LARGE drops in each bag. I had to cut the bag of drops up with a knife so that my babies could have a treat when they come in at night. I have not looked to see where I can reorder the vanilla drop. I do not live near a pet store so I have to order this kind of stuff on my computer. I have not been pleased with the way my order has been handled and probably will not order anything else again."
2,Head wearing magnifying glasses,"It won't stay in place. It keeps slipping and interferes with concentration needed to read, Magnifyong glasses need to cover a larger area."
1,Product should include warning re usage,"I do think this should include a warning or caution re it NOT being usable if one's eyesare of different strengths. Having had cataract surgery in both eyes and the corrected vision being for close sight in one and far in the other, the magnifer doesn't work at all."
5,"Good book, clear, concise, and complete",This book helped me to get my fax gateway development project up and running in (a rather sleepless) 3 days. Would recommend for anyone looking to implement facsimile send/receive. Much more readily comprehensible than the ITU specifications.
1,Fantasy,"So this is the way myths are made...through page after page of misinformation? There might be some truth in this screed, but it would take the patience of Job to extricate it from the fantasy plots. This book is about the spinning of little kernels of truth and dialogue into a money making pastime for the author.A particularly laughable bloated fantasy instance, was that Kate was on the set of ""Swing Time"" with Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire, and George Stevens. Her purpose? To interfere with the making of the film, and the budding romance between Rogers and Stevens. Yeah sure! In those days...she would have been kicked out on her ear. Fred alone, would have gone ballistic. It never happened.This book has no other value other than to prompt musings at the length some authors will travel to avoid the hard work of research...and to indulge the public in their fantasies...for money. It's trash-for-cash writing."
1,Inevitable garbage,"This book gives new meaning to the term junky. This book was, of course, inevitable, but only after Katharine Hepburn's death when she could not refute any of its dubious content and, to put it kindly, guesswork of its author. Whether Hepburn was bisexual or not -- and does it matter? -- the ""evidence"" in support of this book's many assertions is scant at best. Heresay, rumor, and wild guesses are, for this author, apparently the equivalent of research and hard evidence.As other reviewers have previously noted, this book is poorly edited and the writing is sloppy and uninteresting, perhaps the saddest statement of all since there was nothing about Katharine Hepburn that was uninteresting. She deserves much better than this exploitive garbage."
3,Different,This book was okay but too much emphasis on all the actors sexual preferences at that time. According to the book 99% of people in the industry were homosexual. I would have preferred to read more about Katherine and less about what the actor's sexual preferences were.
4,"So you wanna be a star, kid?","K Callan starts off by giving you a no-b.s. look into the way that show biz works that is so dauntingly realistic, you may have to fight the impulse to run screaming to the nearest business school, trade school or college, vowing never to dream of becoming an actor ever again. Then she proceeds to give you valuable tips, tricks of the trade and common sense strategies to help you achieve success, no matter how high the deck is stacked against you. Of course, not everybody will make it no matter how hard they try, but along with guts, talent, looks and ""luck,"" this book will definitely give you an edge. I would've given it five stars, but it appears this edition is due for an update."
3,Does not fold,I like the overall style and look of the table and the ease of putting it together but I was looking for a folding table. One I don't have to put together but once. This is not it. It doesn't fold but comes apart. There were no instructions with this table either. I'm not altogether happy with the table but not unhappy either.
4,Practical table for small space,"Needed an extra table for a small deck, one that can stay out during the season and be stored easily. I looked at many, most are too big and bulky for our deck and some are too light weight for our windy days.This table seems to fit the bill, easy to assemble, versatile (use to serve or for dining) can accommodate an umbrella, and will store offseason either as is or semi assembled. All in all, good value for the price and worked well with big crowd on the 4th!"
2,Not as described,"Two stars because it is pretty. Looks aren't everything, however. Does not fold unless you feel like undoing the nuts and bolts. Could probably do that to any outdoor table. No instructions but pretty easy to figure out. Did not come in original packaging. Does not feel sturdy, either. We will see how it weathers the weather."
5,Great pastry cloth and pad!,I love the pastry cloth and non-slip pad. It's large and can be used flat on the countertop instead of wrapped around a cutting board. When I washed it there were no wrinkles and the edges didn't roll up as my old pastry cloths did.
4,Does the job,This product does what it is supposed to. Can't ask for much more. A good quality buy for the price.
2,Too unfocussed to be useful except (maybe) for managers.,"This could possibly be helpful in getting a boss to see things your way in a disagreement over security -- provided you could get your boss to read a whole book on the subject. I am uncertain who the target audience is for this, but I know of no-one in that audience."
1,Disappointment,"Written in an annoyingly chatty conversational style, this book tells the same story over and over about how clueless clients set up cyber-shop with no security whatsoever. This book is of no technical value."
3,Not what you expect,"This book does not show you how to secure your Intranet. Basically it tells you to have policies and procedures and to hire a security expert to audit your site. It's an easy read and has lots of interesting stories. May be an eye oppener to some people in management that have never tought about security, but if you like technical stuff this book is not for you. It makes you more security conscious, doesn't teach you anything about how to secure anything."
5,i liked it so much i bought fifty copies!,"The book is terrific. I like the mix of case studies and technical content. I really wanted to know the names of the actual companies mentioned in the book.I liked is to much that I bought fifty copies to pass out to friends and customers, then my company hired the author to do a series of seminars."
4,Satisfied with the product.,"I am completely satisfied with the product, and it was easy to install. It arrived on time, was of decent quality, and reasonably priced."
5,Chocolick Chips - Dog treats,My dog loves these treats all the chocolate smelling treats make him happy and they don't smell bad to humans which is a bonus.
5,Great gift for the high school graduate,My son received this book as a graduation gift. I ordered 6 copies to give to his friends. Everyone loves it.
1,"Awful, didn't show up, didn't answer e-mail",Never got the book and they wouldn't answer e-mail. Worst experience I've ever had with Amazon. I'm really ticked.
2,Ouch ! Too many wrong notes ...,"Opp. 51 and 61 are highlights in Dvorak's extensive, but under-rated and under-performed quartet output. These works are less complex than the late quartets of Beethoven or the six of Bartok, but are more beautuful in many ways. There are several excellent recordings of the undulating, melodic Eb and the majestic C major quartets - but this is not one of them. I was surprised at the number of errors that the quartet made, and disappointed at the lack of warmth and vibrancy that is achieved by other groups in the opening bars of the Eb. These discs are full-price, and are not good value. I would recommend the Prague Quartet recordings, which are superior and cheaper if you are thinking of buying the complete works (well worthwhile - the less famous quartets are a Pandora's box of melodic gems). If you just want to dabble, then get the Vlach quartet recordings on Naxos. Opp. 51, 34, 80, 61, 96, 104 and 105 are a must."

5,Psychotherapist/Playwright Touches Many Chords,"The author manages to convey deep insights about life, death, marriage, much more in language any layman can understand. I have read it twice and will dip into it again and again for inspiration and enlightenment. - Guida Jackson (author of The Patchwork Mind)"
5,IMPRESIONANTE,"ESTE NOVELA ES IMPRESIONANTE, ES UNA NOVELA APOCALIPTICA COMO NO LA HAY, TE ATRAPA DESDE EL PRIMER MOMENTO NO PODRAS DEJAR DE LEERLA UNA VEZ QUE EMPIECES (UNA NOVELA DE DESASTRE COMO NO LO HA HABIDO EN LA HISTORIA Y QUE PRONTO SUCEDERA) SUPER RECOMENDADA (Y SUS SECUELAS NO SE QUEDAN ATRAS SON IGUAL DE INCREIBLES) NO DEBES DE PASAR ESTE ESTE LIBRO, EXIGE SER LEIDO"
2,Limited use flash bracket-strickly for a tripod,"I needed a flash bracket for two radio controlled flashes. This bracket would have done the trick but the two ""arms"" that the flashes attach to will not stay locked in place if you move at all. I even tried putting ""star"" lock washers in, but both arms still worked loose in a very short time.This bracket was obviously made for use ONLY with a tripod.BOTTOM LINE: For the price of this bracket it was not designed very well. I sent it back and ordered the ADORAMA Rotating flash bracket for my EOS 30D Canon, which worked just fine and was a bargin."
5,I could not put this book down,"Wikipedia has a lengthy article about Omm Seti (aka. Dorothy Louise Eady).From Wikipedia: 'A New York Times article described her life story as ""one of the Western World's most intriguing and convincing modern case histories of reincarnation"".'I enjoyed reading this book and I have recommended reading it to many people."
5,A very well written book on the life of an extraordinary woman,"Regardless of one's views on reincarnation or on the transmission of memory, it should be remembered that Dorothy Eady was a first-rate Egyptologist. The author strikes a good balance in telling the tale of a life well lived."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"I had seen Reba on Oprah with Justin Timberlake and that is why I bought the CD. Except for two songs (Justin's and Kelly's), I was disappointed. Reba sings over her partner in each duet, so it is difficult to tell who she is actually singing with.Very disappointing."
3,Duet means two voices,"I really enjoyed some of the songs, but found myself wishing I could hear the other people singing, especially Justin Timberlake. Everyone knows Reba can belt a song, but a duet should showcase both performers."
5,"This album is a ""10+++++++""",This has got to be one of the finest albums ever put out. Reba was fabulous (As always). Her choices in songs and those singing with her was perfect. I can't wait for her to do another album. She is as beautiful as ever and still has one of the finest voices in country music.
2,Disappointing,"I saw the video duet with Reba and Kelly Clarkson and loved it -- decided to buy the whole disc. Many of the other tracks are pretty disappointing, especially the duet with Timberlake."
4,Zoom Out,"This CD came up when I did a search for Carole King. While I like Reba and have a couple CDs, I don't zoom out with each new release. Glad I picked this one up. The opening cut with LeAnn Rimes, ""When You Love Someone Like That,"" is pure magic. The track has hooks and two blockbuster country singers belting passionately. ""Everyday People"" may actually be the first Carole King vocal on a song she didn't write! The two women's voices blend together well, not surprising with the country songs that dot King's albums and McEntire's penchant for championing the little guy. No tracks are weak with many like Kelly Clarkson-penned ""Because of You"" being gems. ""The Only Promise That Remains,"" the song Justin Timberlake penned for the set, has a beautiful melody with a passionate Reba vocal. ""Duets"" is a strong set that retains its 100% Reba stamp track to track. Enjoy!"
5,Awesome CD,Reba has always been one of my favorite female vocalists. I love the different styles of music on this CD and variety of artists.
4,Great chemistry,"This is a great collection of Reba and friends. Reba has such great chemistry with every singer who has joined the lineup with her.I was especially excited for the Justin and Reba duet on: ""The Only Promise That Remains"" but you can barely here Justin on the song at all. He did write it and it is a great song I just wish his vocals would have been more featured in the song as with the other singer on the other tracks.The standout songs on this set is ""Because Of You"" with Kelly Clarkson and ""When You Love Someone Like That"" with LeAnn Rimes both singers really sing their hearts out on their respective songs - amazing!Every song on here is a great one because, like I said before, the chemistry is amazing between Reba and each individual singer.Well worth the purchase! Just a bit disappointed in the Justin duet otherwise a great CD.JAC ~~~~ 07'"
4,Duets,"I bought this on a whim at Target. I have to say that generally anything that Reba puts out has been fantastic. I have to say that I have truly enjoyed listening to the album. I do have to say that while not all of the songs are my favorites, I will say that they were all done very nicely and beautifully. The harmonies were wonderful. I also enjoyed that she gathered artists from other genres to help out on this album, not just Country, while the majority are Country artists."
3,A bit disappointed,"I agree with the person who commented that the mood of this CD is ""somber and tame"" in song type and tempo. While I love powerful ballads as much as the next person, I kept anticipating that maybe the NEXT song would be upbeat but, no, just like the last one (with the only exception that even came close to upbeat in theme and tempo was ""Everyday People""). While there are some good songs and performances on the CD, I found it depressing! I know, this is country music and a lot of times it's telling a sad tale - LOL - but I don't want a whole CD full of ""I'm so miserable"". I was so looking forward to getting this CD and I am disappointed in it."
1,Shoddy work for a great artist,"I love Reba -- always have and always will. I love her voice, her personality, and how classy she is. I own almost all of her albums. All of that being said, however, this album is a HUGE disappointment. The songs sound like they were written in about 5 minutes and rushed to recording. There is almost no blending of voices, but rather the artists just take turns singing. With the great singers on this CD, it could have been a real blockbuster. But I'm sorry to say it is only mediocre. I still love Reba, though."
4,YEP !! BUY THIS CD,Great Reba! Reba just has a sparkling voice that superbly twists and turns around her partners vocals on these duets. Just a testament to her talent and conviction to entertain. She loves her fans. This CD is great listening however I would have liked to hear more of other singers dueting on her songs.
3,Reba's latest is just okay,Reba's newest CD is okay . . . I was expecting more with all the great stars who shared duets but was disappointed.
2,A little dissapointed!,I really expected more of her older duets and was a little dissapointed with only 11 songs. I didn't really research what was on the CD before I purchased it so I am only to blame. I would love to have a duets CD with all the old songs so I guess I will have to make my own.
4,Reba Fans- Buy This CD!,"This is a very good cd- a must have for Reba fans. She sings duets with great artists. The song that her and Kelly Clarkson sing, ""Because of You"", is just fantastic. They're both very strong female singers and they sound good together. Reba's voice has never sounded better."
5,I never listened to Reba's music before....,"Yes, I bought this for the JT single and no, you can't hear him. Oh, well. I love Reba on her show and the only song of hers I ever heard is the theme on her show.The only country (is it ""pop"" country) i listen to is Kenny Rogers. So I can't really compare this, can I?I very much enjoyed the CD. The first song ""Because of You"" is a grabber and an excellent opener.Good CD from a non-country listener. And now I'm hip to some more sounds! :)"
5,Classy Return From Everyone's Favorite Red Head,"Once you push play on your CD player you realize you are about to embark on an amazing journey. Reba crafted an album with class, quality and love and presented itself in 11 carefully selected tracks.We begin with a power house duet with a love em and leave em guy, and Leann plays the part of the woman who thought she could love and change the man. Reba chirps in as the sensitive friend who lets her know it wasn't her fault.As we progress the album deals with Love Lost, Alcoholism, Strength a Salute to the Men and Women who keep us safe and the Ultimate testament of love.Reba also shows something missing from her last few albums, a deep love and peace with the songs she has recorded. Not since What If It's You has Reba sounded more happy and content on the album.This is truly a class act from a legendary performer."
5,Reba Duets,"I have been a fan of Reba McEntire since I saw the video Cathy's Clown on CMT. Once I saw that video and heard her voice I was hooked, and have bought every album since. Reba's new album Duets it absolutely amazing! I bought it yesterday and listened to it immediately. I first heard her new single, ""Because of You"" on CMT's Crossroads, which I thought was amazing performance. I couldn't wait to hear what some of the other duets would sound like, especially with Justin Timberlake and Vince Gill. I have to say that the song ""The Only Promise That Remains"" with Justin is one of my favorites. The music had me captured and the Reba's voice was just amazing. Justin was a great duet partner as well. The only thing that would have made this CD better in my opinion was to have a song with Martina McBride!"
5,Absolutely the best duets album out there,Very well done. Each song should be a hit. I'm particularly fond of the song with Justin Timberlake. Who would have thought that a country singer and a pop singer could sound so exceptional!
4,Reba Duets,"My wife is the bigger fan of Country Music. But, I will stop and listen to Reba anytime. Her music is electric and enjoyable. This is must for all those that love Reba. My son especially is a big fan and he recommended the CD. Enjoy country because it is True, True Americana. You go girl!!!!"
4,It's OK!,"This is the first Reba CD that I own. I had very high hopes for the CD, partly because I heard good reviews about her. When I listened to this CD, the songs were pretty good, but not as good as what I had hoped for! Good songs, but I get bored after listening for a couple of times."
4,Love Reba,"I am a true Reba fan. She can do not wrong. Her ""Duet's"" CD is typical of the fine quality of work from a woman blessed with a great voice."
3,Regular Reba,"Reba's got a really great voice and now some really great voices to sing with, but it turns out like all of Reba's past work: lacking. I bought this album off the strength of the trac with Kelly Clarkson and all the great voices in the trac listing. Faith, Trisha, Kenny, Vince Gill, and Don Henley, how can this thing possibly go wrong? Well it's got the same problem as all of Reba's albums - her inability to pick good songs. Most of the content is just okay, and although you have two great singers on every trac singing it for all it's worth, they can't do much with it except take it up a notch maybe two. Best songs on the album are the one's with Kenny Chesney and Kelly Clarkson."
5,Reba - The Great,"I am proud of Reba for putting together a CD of this type with many great country singers. I love the duet with her and Kelly ""Because of you"" the most. I think they really hit it right because they both have strong voices.Her and Justin Timberlake, you can barely hear him. Still, I do like the song. It is different than most Reba songs, but she still puts her special touch on it.I do recommend you to buy this CD if you have not already. It is worth having it in your collection because of who all is in it. I like the other artists okay, but her and Kelly stand out the most to me. It is more laid back than most of Reba's CD's.Tracy B. Evans - Author of Fatal Kidnapping"
4,Terrific,One of the best duets CD that you will find. Almost every song is a winner. Unusual to find so many songs that you like. This is a must....
4,FAST AND GREAT SERVICE,Love the product. The order was here within less than a week. Will buy from this site again.
3,"Sorry, only So So",I was eagerly anticpating this CD after seeing the duet with Kelly Clarkson. It is solid CD music wise but I would not rate as one of her 10 best efforts. I didn't feel the Reba spark on most of the songs and her collaberators seemed dull at times. It was like everyone laid down their tracks at different times. If they hadn't indicated that Justin Timberlake was on one of the songs you wouldn't have known who she was doing a duet with. It will have a big sales debut but at Christmas will this be a CD to give as a gift? I'm sorry but this is not a CD years from now you are going say I want to hear it again or play over and over again!Thank goodness I have 6 other Reba's that I do want to hear over and over.
2,Dullsville,"Reba's choice of material is the problem here. In ""Because of You"" are listeners supposed to believe that young Kelly Clarkson has caused 50-something (albeit terrific-looking!) Reba not to ""...stray too far from the sidewalk?"" The roles should be reversed.There are very few up-tempo numbers, and the precise production of the album makes it seem as if the project has no energy. It's good to hear from Carole King, Vince Gill, and Leanne Rimes, but Reba's voice is mixed louder than any of her duet partners', and in some cases, the duet ""partner"" is barely given a verse of his/her own, making it more of a glorified background vocal.I rate this cd two-stars, solely because Reba's voice remains one of the best in the business."
3,Such a disappointment!,I waited for this CD to be released. I rushed to the store on Tuesday moring put it in my car and what a let down. Talk about depressing. If I had a gun I would of shot myself! It could have been so much better. Like someone else said it was a rush job. I think only done for the almight dollar sad to say.
1,Worst edited book I've come across,"I'm an instructor for Descriptive Geometry and am amazed at how a company can release a book so poorly edited. I'm now using the second edition and the same problems still exist. The views are incorrect, information is missing, and the CD problem sets are largely missing and incorrectly labled. Good example - 1st chapter all 11 review problems are either incorrectly dimensioned, the views incorrect, hidden lines are shown as solid, etc. In chapter 3 of the nine review problems given, the CD only gives three of them and all three are incorrectly labled. Oh - and if you want to show the answers from the instructors CD on an overhead projector most of the answers problems object lines are dark grey on a black background. Need I say more?"
3,This book was ok,This book was a required for a drafting course I took. I found the book a little difficult to understand in some areas. The book seemed a bit dated as well.
5,An album which contains the hardest rocking song ever!,"Get this album for black tears, one of the hardest rocking songs I have ever heard. My cousin from Cali brought this album home one time, and I fell in love with black tears. Download it or something, this song rules. What up Bec"
4,Science Fiction,"The Revolution is over in England, and the crowded island needs a boost in its economy. So, the Government has decided to stage the murder of Jules Tanner."
2,Longest short book of my life,"When you're taking on Science Fiction, when you've decided to delve into the surreal, you must remember two things. First, SciFi must be entertaining. Second, Surrealism must have ultimately have a point. The main failing of this book is that it was completed without a point or any entertainment value. It is a book without a spine. Give it a pass and let it die a silent death."
2,More Torture porn,"The lead actress of this film does a fantastic job portraying the damaged young lead, but the movie really couldn't hold me because it is just this shallow shell of a film that just seems like an excuse to make a mixed salad of scenes of violence and says to hell with a worth a damn story line. If you like films like Hostel, then you'd dig this - but if you are looking for something smart and something that'll grab your attention and give you a gore-filled ride with brains to match, then this can be skipped, cause this ain't that film."
4,"Forget Jennifer's Body,this girl is *really* sick",Excellent gory horror movie about a girl who gets her kicks by teaching people she doesn't like manners the fun way.Loved every minute.
2,Whew this one was pretty gross and cheaply made,"I admit I love a weird bizarre flick more than the average horror fan. Parts of this movie where morbidly amusing and twisted. But overall, this movie had little to any plot and was very cheaply made. Don't waste your money."
4,All true horror fans should see this,"I wont go over the plot of this movie as it has already been done.If you like frightnight, evil dead, Army of Darkness, Reanimator or the first three Dead movies by George Romero.........you must see Sick Girl."
1,One of the worst ever,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I've watched a lot of ""B"" horror movies - this is D- at best. The story had potential but the sound and cinematography were awful. You can barely understand most of the dialog. The story is disjointed - just what was the connection of the school bus slaughter? Andy Signore was hilarious in the outtake - they should have left it in. If you want to watch a really good sick movie watch Any Signore's ""The Janitor."" Now that's sick AND funny with a great story line."
4,Pretty Cool,"This isn't your average horror movie if you're into mainstream horror.This digs much deeper into the character's psyche and shows no mercy.If you're into twisted independent horror movies that have lots of gore you won't be disappointed.The girl isn't the best actress in the world, but it doesn't really take away much from the movie since the film itself is unpredictable and leads you to try and figure out why she's on a killing spree.This movie is not for everyone since it contains children being abused and killed as well as a graphic rape scene. Girl on girl rape scene that is. Not so hot as it may sound though since well...you'll find out for yourself. Haha.I enjoyed it for what it was. It wasn't too over the top for my taste, yet it didn't lack what i was looking for. Basically i got what i wanted out of the movie.So 4 stars it is!"
2,It needs 20 more minutes,"1) the sound is bad, you barely hear her at timesok - to those who didn't see the movie I will now be vague -2) It needs a beginning.. to me there HAS to be some back-story about the bus and the guys in the car.. how did she know WHO to take? Just a 15 minute into or even a montage would have done it.3)It needs 5 more minutes at the end.. it left me hanging I was like""ok.. now what will she do.. hey it's the credits?""But the movie itself is ok - I liked it. It wasn't as gory or sick as I thought it would be be, but she is cool as a ""Sick"" girl (and the end scene was pretty sick!)Again I just wish they tied up the story better and the sound is bad, that's why I only give it 2 stars.Oh.. and the mini-documentary is pretty cool! I actually liked her film about her ""death-by"" pictures more interesting than the movie itself :)Jim"
1,Not What I Expected,"I didn't notice any difference after following the directions on the bottle. I left the product on overnight just to try to break down the dog smell in my son's room. I tried 2 applications with no change, even trying to rub in the liquid. I knew the cleaner didn't help when my puppy went back to the exact same spot the day after I thought my problem was solved. That is only spot in the house she chose to leave me a surprise. I ended up cleaning with a spray foam carpet cleaner for pets the next day with better results. *One additional note, the bottles were put inside plastic bags so when they leaked it was into a bag. I wish they had sealed the bottles in the bags though since some cleaner came out of the bags when I took the bags out of the box. I will keep looking for a great odor remover since I want to keep my dogs."
2,Does not live up to product claims,This doesn't work any better on cat hairball stains then my usual Nature's Miracle and this product smells unpleasant. Won't buy again.
2,Don't Buy This One; Re-Read One Of Her Other Books Instead,"I was ready to love this book, as I have loved Judith Martin's other Miss Manners books. As I began reading, I expected to find the same combination of sophisticated social consciousness, wicked yet gentle wit, and sparkling prose that make her other books so wonderful. But, alas, it seems even Miss Manners has to lay an egg once in a while. This book was not a bit funny; In fact, it seemed almost mean-spirited and sarcastic at times. It isn't quite rude, of course, but just the same, it lacks the lively spirit of cheerful helpfulness, and the brilliant intellect, that is present in her other books. Sorry, Ms. Martin."
4,At long last...,"For the fans of Miss Manners, this is the one so long awaited. Instead of her typical format (q-&a, as seen in her columns,) this is the fruition of the ideas first presented in Common Courtesy. Rather than the how-tos of etiquette, she fully presents all the whys, whens and whats. An engaging combination of play, novel and history textbook, it's difficult to put down, while each paragraph could be digested three times over for the layers of meaning. It's exactly the little book one wants to leave about for others to infectiously read. No patriotic American can fail to lift his head up high after reading this. Unhitch the horses, boys, it's time to pull Miss Manners through the streets ourselves!"
4,Hollywood gossip from a guy's point of view,"So much is known and written about Hollywood gossip columns, from the point of view of the big three gals - Louella Parsons, Hedda Hopper, and Sheilah Graham. I thought this book was a refreshing change to see how the business and art of peddling Hollywood gossip is filtered through a guy's lens. This book was well-researched, and well-written, and makes an interesting addition to the library of anyone fascinated with Hollywood's peak years."
4,Sasquatch can't get song out of head.,"Me finally get shiny disc of more Rockford Files. Sasquatch wish me live on beach and solve crime. Me would help people that need and get guys that bad. Me like show, but me who is Sasquatch cannot get song out head. Me hear when me try to sleep. Me hear when me fish. Me still hear when me try to whittle stick.Sometimes me forget and then Owl hum song from show. Me know he do it on purpose."
1,Defective dvds ruin the fun of collecting,"I love the Rockford Files. I hate it when I have to send back a 5 disc 23 episode set because I watch the first 20 episodes then number 21 wont play. Now I have to buy it again, and of course I have to watch all the same episodes all over again to make sure the new set plays properly. I've been through this before but it ruins what was a fun time watching one of my favorite TV shows."
4,love it but 1 downfall,love the quickness of the lens but when the standard flash is used a shadow is created on the image because of the length of the lens
5,The best,"This is simply a splendid lens. On my D 200 it has produced miracles. Indeed color rendition is simply superb as is contrast. I thought initially it was going to be a bit expensive but my friendly camera store convinced me othewhise. It is a great allround lens that can be used for everything despite its size. The only problem is that at 17 mm and even before, the built-in flash on the D 200 will give a shadow of the lens on the bottom so yuo will probably be better off using a separate flash (that I have still not bought but that I now recommend all my friends to buy with these Nikons). I also never use the sun shade since the lens then simply becomes enormous. I had been using some older autofocus lenses on my D200 before but this has now become my standard lens."
2,As is not worth the purchase,"I got the camera lens in a timely fashion, it did work, it it took the photos. The problem is, the motor drive for the auto focus was really noisey and all the pictures were a little blurry at 40 to 55mm. I thought it was just me having to much motion, turns out even on a tripod it was the same. I called Nikon and they had me send them photos to review. They contacted me and told me I needed to send the lens in for repair.With shipping and repair I am still under the cost of a brand new lens but not by much but still out an additional 300.00....I would not buy a used lens again, just to big a gamble."
1,Who are they kidding?,"Canon offers similar lens with image stabilization for about 20% less.By not offering image stabiliztion in-body, both Canon and Nikon extrorts permium each time you buy a lens. As far as this lens is concerned, for most users are better of with two fast primes and will be cheaper as well. Unfortunately, 50mm F1.4 is only Nikon prime that auto focuses on sub-D90 bodies. Current generation of Nikon bodies are best of the breed, but they don't lens selection Canon offers."
4,A discipline without yelling and spanking,"I live in overseas and the only method I have been told to discipline the youngsters is to spank or yell at them. I bought this book when my little one just around two years old. I find this book is very useful and the instruction is very clear. My son used to refuse to eat any kinds of vegetable except brocoli but after I used time-out twice, this problem never appear again. Time-out may not be able to discipline every misbehavior but at least it can help both parent and child calming down for several minutes. I find it useful not just for correcting children's mishaviors but also an alternative for parents without yelling and spanking."
1,Worst written and most trite material I have ever read.,"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The material was not very helpful -- it has been explained better elsewhere. The author writes as if parents are idiots and he is the only one with the answers. Save your money, time and sanity and don't bother with this."
1,Horrid Book,"I was very disappointed by this book. It offered confusing explanations of on obiously simple technique that can be explained in a page. The author was self-congradulatory on coming-up with ""feel-good"" solutions to discipine problems. I would most stongly urge interested parents to get the book entitled ""Dare to Discipline"" if they want solid advice that is well written."
2,Waste of money,"Not needed, cheap and not worth the money. Just so you all know, do the rest of the work first and then see if you really need this or not!"
2,Don't be fooled by the look!,"This looked perfect for my stereo installation. I used a similar setup to install a car stereo before and knew it would be easiest to have a custom fitted sleeve for my after market stereo. What the description doesn't say (and the front of the packaging doesn't say) - this is a custom fitted sleeve to sit below your stereo to hold 3 CD jewel cases. Doesn't hold a car stereo at all. The opening isn't the right size for the stereo either so you can't even whittle out the inside brackets and still use it. Oh well, I think I found a different use for it and it is pretty solid looking, but definitely not what I thought."
4,Nice fit for my 2004 Forester,"The good news is that it installed fast and fit perfectly. Also looks pretty good. Not perfect, as one screw stripped. They are very short and the plastic is not high enough quality to tighten screws into. And there are holes in the back of it. Don't know why they are there, but if something were to go through them, it would be lost behind my dashboard. So I taped over them before installing."
3,Very Confusing,"The description and specs for this are very misleading. As another reviewer noted, this is only the plastic pocket that goes BELOW the radio. My '97 Subaru Legacy already had that pocket but I thought I was buying a kit that included the pocket and a way to install an aftermarket radio - this wasn't it. A special installation kit wasn't even needed in my case (which is probably why I had such a hard time finding one on Metra's website). The vehicle has a bracket that holds the factory pocket and radio in place. To install a new radio I didn't need anything else, I just pulled the factory radio and put in the aftermarket JVC radio. The holes lined up perfectly - no install kit needed. This might be a good kit if you have a double din radio from the factory and need a way to cover the hole it would leave after installing a single din radio."
2,BLACK not silver,In the picture the plastic case looks like the outter edge is silver to match the inside of the subaru. Its Not!!! Its black. You guys should really update the pictures to let us see the actual color of the item. Thanks..
3,"Timing set, TC Gaskets set.","Timing chain was loose,not tight like Chevy's.I know some fords are loose.I had to install set I was pressed for time.Compresstion increased and was a lot better then old timing set that had 201,070 miles. I use Cloyes on Racing and OEM (Stock) engines,and are always tight."
2,Wider than specified,Had to belt sand the side-most nubs to fit it into a 2.10 space. High rolling resistance on the road. Burrs (not even goat heads) went right through and punctured the tube. Must use green goo (Slime) with these if they will be ridden in weedy fields.
4,Nice tires,Good replacement for my daughters tires. Rides and looks good too.. better than the old school white walls that came original with the bike
2,Bottle needs modified!,Bottle too fat should be longer and smaller diameter. Hard for smaller hands such as a smaller woman to hold.
2,No where near as good as Which Witch,"I read this to my kids after they liked Which Witch. Unfortunately it was no where near as good.The characters weren't as interesting (I didn't find myself caring what happened to them), now was the story.Instead of this book, try Which Witch by the same author.My kids also liked the Bill Brittain series that included devils Donkey and Wish Giver.I get the impresssion the author is a supporter of PETA and is more interested in political statements than telling a good story (which this is not).The ""bad guys"" were people who abuse animals. They are bad, but there are plenty worse in this world."
1,Not worth reading,"Good idea for a story - 2 graduates of Witch school go their separate ways and then later meet up and join forces against a common enemy.Unfortunately this book is not worth reading. I've read far worse, but with so many good boks out there, there is no reason to waste time on it.- the characters are not interesting or likable- the story is poorly done- the ""bad guys"" are not what I would consider real bad guys- my children didnt like the book"
1,New one lasted just over a year,"I know these units are a major problem with Ford vehicles. I changed ours last year. I did expect the replacement to last longer than a year, though. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Apparently Dorman can't make them any better than Ford can."
2,silly,"As I was reading this book, I felt that I should be out in the wilderness, in some sort of native american dress (no offence to native americans), with a drum and a speaking stick, expressing my maleness. The author's attitude of men will be men and they cannot but help to act in an irresponsible manner is limited, insulting, and dangerous. Is this a mergering of the mens' movement and the gay right's movement? Are we as shallow and predatory as the stereotype portrays us? According to Guy Kettlehack, I guess we are. Lawrence"
2,Rather boring,Very basic book. I thought it would be a lot more interesting for me since I am a huge Redskin and Hog fan.
5,Born in the USA,"This pan in perfect. Sturdy and well-made. It is large enough to really ""throw"" some food around without spilling onto the stove - one of my main goals in a stir fry. And, to top it off, finally....a product made in America!"
2,Disappointed,"This wok does not heat up hot enough rendering it useless for fried rice and other dishes that require quick, high temperature cooking."
3,Good comedy for MOPS meeting,"I saw Anita at a Women of Faith conference and she had me in tears, so I bought this DVD. Maybe my expectations were too high? I watched it with my husband, so maybe that's why I didn't find it as funny as I might have if I were with a group of women. A friend of mine who runs MOPS meetings (Mothers of Preschoolers) said her group thought it was hysterical. I thought her spoken comedy was so-so, but her songs are very funny."
3,Moms...,I wish I had had this 4 years ago. I believe the momsense song seems more funny every time I hear it. The rest of the video really is geared to new moms.
5,Excellent Humor!,This proves it! You CAN be funny without being offensive! Great variety... stand up and music. I'm going to have a girl's night at my home just so I can show this to my friends :)
4,A Great Gift for daughters who have children,"I chose this as one of the small Christmas presents to give to my daughter who is the mother of our grandaughter. We all have loved it and it is humor that can be listened to again and again. It also would be very good for any women's fellowship. I am sure my daughter will get much use out of it with women in her church and at work. Her husband is a church pastor and she is a nurse.Steve WilbrahamTampa, FL"
1,Please Read Before Purchase,"I don't know how many of these people that wrote their reviews for this book actually bought the book at amazon. I bought the book, and found out it's only the TEXT! If you want the real ""A Basic Reader in THREE VOLUMES"" I suggest you buy it from a third party dealer. I got it from BCD Books at amazon because they actually sell the 3 volumes as one unit. If you want to learn classical chinese, this is what you'll need.""Classical Chinese: A Basic Reader Text"" <- Volume 1""Classical Chinese: A Basic Reader Glossaries"" <- Volume 2""Classical Chinese: A Basic Reader Analyses"" <- Volume 3The book advertised here on amazon as ""Classical Chinese: A Basic Reader in Three Volumes"" is ONLY VOLUME ONE, the Text. I don't know why the heck they advertised it the way they did, it is very misleading. Please be warned, don't have simply the text sent to your house and regret x_x like I did and had to buy it again."
1,they're not that cool,They sent me the wrong book. A couple of my classmates also recieved the wrong books from this company. As far as I am concered they're chumps.
2,karate teacher,It was a pretty hard read. it was easy to put down .only a couple of really good letters if you like books like this I think I would choose another one beside this book.
1,bad disc,"i sent this item back, through no fault of amazon, because the install disc was bad. i called pinnacle about this and they sent me a new disc by bulk surface mail that took 2 weeks to arrive!!! i could not use the new disc because they neglected to sent a product key to open the damn thing. poor customer relations and service on the part of pinnacle. GREAT service on the part of amazon. it was easy to return the item and get a refund. i will use amazon again and thank them for their service *****'s.."
4,Great Book,Lots of good info & insight. Hard to find this quality of knowledge around. Buy it if you have any interest in the market
3,Angel Eyes,"My shaded-silver persian who has the dark excretions from the eyes, doesn't seem to like to taste of this - whether I mix it in wet food, sprinkle on dry and when I put it in water as suggested, it just floats on top - won't mix in. Her eyes have cleared up a bit, but not fully - been using about a month now."
1,Cat won't go near this,"We have been unable to get our himmy persian to touch the stuff. Even after withholding other food, she would not go near it. Can't imagine why it would be advertised for cats."
1,Read reviews before puchasing this product,"I should have read other reviews before purchasing this product! My persian is a total mooch, He wants to try and eats most anything. I put a half teaspoon of this on his food and he will not go near it! Can't return it because it is open, so don't waste your money!"
4,"I solved the bad taste problem by putting this in capsules. Two of my kitties were allergic to this, however.","I solved the bad taste problem by putting this in capsules. Two of my kitties were allergic to this, however. One had some swelling on his eyelids. The other kept trowing up. But for the main kitty that needed it, she is tolerating it well and it is significantly reducing the dark tear STAINS on her white fur. I also use Eye Envy topical products. Between these two products, she is looking much better! I show my cats."
1,ugh,can not get any of our four persian cats to consume this product no matter what we mix it with .we have tried everything we can think of even thier most favorite food and they will not touch it once this product has been introduced in it .
3,Not as bad as they say,"This is a decent product, although it isn't meant to last you a whole day it does what it should. Despite the reviews stating they charge for ten hours and got half an hour of paly time. THe only reason that occurs is because a battery gets damaged and looses charge when held to long, the battery can only hold so long no matter how long you charge it. I do not own a battery, but i have a friend who does. When we went to New Hampshire we used the screen and got at least a hour and a half of game time. If you follow the instructions in the pamphlet the battery will work fine.[...]"
3,The Truth,"Well, I do not actually own this but I saw in the reviews above that they were saying that they charged it for ten hours and got five minutes out of it. I'm pretty sure it was because of the fact you were running a Gamecube AND a portable screen of that one battery. It says in the booklet it will last 1 1/2 hours normally. It's just a time for the gamecube if your only runnig the Gamecube off the battery."
1,This Stinks,When I got this game for Christmas I thought was in for something cool. I tried it and hated it. I have a screen and I tried out the battery pack. When I charged it I expected an hour and a half of playing time. My first time playing I got a grand total of 5 minutes. I tried again later and all that happened was the gamecube icon come up again and again and agian. So take my advise this battery packmay sound like the coolest gamecube accesory but you'll be ripped off.
3,Just ok,"This book offers run-of-the-mill exercises that fail to inspire one to write. If you struggle with the act of sitting down and putting pen to paper, this book will not change that. I would love to see a book out there that offers innovative exercises that not only inspire one to write, but also improves writing along the way. If anyone can recommend such a book, please message me."
5,"If you've ever thought, ""I could write that""","Have you read stories in O, The Oprah Magazine and thought, I could write that.Do you have ideas that would make a good essay, novel, memoir, or magazine article?Have you always wanted to get started on these projects but never had the time or just plain didn't know where to start?If so, this is the book for you.Forget complex writing theory...this book teaches you how to translate your ideas into writing AND shows you how to work writing into your busy life. (Not just for women by the way!)This book taught me how to:1. Get my ideas onto paper.2. Accept that my first draft might be crappy - but that's OK.3. Revise my drafts until I had a finished product that I would be proud to show to the world.It's actually pretty easy if you just follow the author's advice. There's no magic here. You don't need to wait for your 'inspiration'. Like the subtitle says, you just need to ignite the writer within.Enjoy the book. Let me know what you think."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,"Once you open this book, you won't put it down. You will be writing each time you boil water, fold laundry, or between changing poopy diapers!!! I recommend this book to all serious and wanna be writers. This book is AMAZING!"
5,A lifechanging gift,"A life changing giftI gave this book to a writer friend as a gift, and it has been her constant companion ever since. We speak often about the book's contents, and I've never known her to write with more diligence and inspiration than she has in the time since receiving this book.I now plan to purchase a copy for myself."
4,Set your timer and GO-,"DeMarco-Barrett has tapped the source of a writer's black hole: time. Not enough of it and when there is time, rest rather than inspiration take hold. Not to beleaguer the point, Ms. Barret helps with that first bite of the elephant. Don't think you have to sit down and write the great American novel to be a writer. Just sit down and write. She guides the beginner, the uninspired, and the undiscliplined through the maze. A sort of social worker for The Unfit Writers League, Ms. Barret takes the scariness out of writing in her step-by-step and creative excercise approach."
4,Great lotion,"My derm recommended this for morning use, in the evening I use retin a. It does it's job. I used to use super expensive creams costing 30 or 50 and sometimes even more. But then I read a plastic surgeons book that said ""anything that could actually absorb through your skin would not be sold over the counter"". So now with the retin a and this, my skin has never looked better.It stings a tiny bit, but it's supposed to. Giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because it's smells like elmers glue."
4,The crab and book are cute BUT the teether needs work!!!!,"I bought these for my baby for Christmas and she loves the crab and the book...they are very cute! The crab is very lightweight so he is easy for a smallers baby to hold. The book is cute and you can clip it onto your seat or stroller. The one thing I DO NOT like about this set is the teether...which was my main reason for buying this set! The first teether I received didn't even vibrate! I sent it back and they sent me a new one and it is somewhat functional, BUT they would have to chew on it VERY VERY hard to even get it to vibrate! What is the point!? They are other vibrating teethers out there by FIRST YEARS that virates easier for them if that is what you are looking for! =)"
3,"some good, some not so good","Our child really likes the crab and the book, but the vibrating teether has already become opaque (in just a few weeks) and doesn't always vibrate, it still serves the purpose as a teether, but I wouldn't recommend the combo pack."
5,GREAT NASCAR HUMOR!!!,"This book is a MUST HAVE for any NASCAR fan. It is hilarious! Mike Smith has a great sense of humor. Don't believe me? Check out his most recent ""stockcartoons""...You'll really like this book if you are an Anti-Jeff Gordon fan....although Mike Smith is nice to Gordon a few times."
1,Fine until it STOPPED WORKING...!,"I purchased this system April 2005 and was quite pleased with it until it stopped working on 8/11/06. The sound had been good and the clock was so handy. However, then it stopped -- I can hear it shuffle, but nothing happens and the only way to turn the power completely off is to unplug it. Now there's 5 CDs stuck inside and the only way it appears to get them out will be to break each of the individual CD trays. I will never again purchase a player with this kind of loading system."
1,and a list price (!) of $64.99 ???,"This is really sleezy selling. A supposedly list price of $64.99 for ONE BOX??? Then ""discounting"" to $4.97? For ONE BOX? Amazing if this doesn't violate Amazon guidelines --- not the price per se, but the duplicity. NO ONE would think they meant $65 for one cardboard box."
4,Off The Beaten Path,"We have a motor home and love finding out of the way places. This is a great resource that we have used often. Unfortunately we tried to use it in 1999 and several of the ""places"" no longer exhisted. Because they are off the beaten path, we had traveled many miles off our route to our disappointment. We wish a revised edition was available"
2,WHY???,"Like the previous reviewer, I too wonder why this sub-par collection of filler tunes was chosen to be released over the Twennynine projects. WhenI ordered it I didn't know it was a re-issue, I thought it was New Lenny White, and all of Lenny's latest releases have been very good ventures.So I took a chance,a gamble. When I received it I quickly read the liner notes to see who was on it with Mr. White. The first warning sign was that all of the songs had vocals. The second sign was the presense of Marcus Miller on all songs with no production or co-production credits(he doesn't do that very often these days).Once I played the disc my dissappointment was complete. I crapped out."
4,Tastes fine and makes good cherry pies,"We love cherry pie made with tart cherries, we find the pre-made cherry pie fillings a bit too sweet, so I was so happy to find the Oregon Fruit Pitted Red Tart Cherries in Water at Amazon as the price was competitive, or better, than at my local grocery store.The cherries themselves were tasty and made perfect pie. Be aware there is a warning on the label concerning cherry pits.Also, the cans of cherries arrived pretty dinged up. The strange thing is how the packaging was surrounding the cans looked fine, but the cans were dented. For this reason I probably won't purchase the cherries from Amazon again.Recommend with caveats given."
2,How can one confuse Gooseberries for Red Tart Cherries?,"Oregon Fruit Pitted Red Tart Cherries in Water, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 8)Red Tart Cherries are hard to find in the grocery store, so I was thrilled when I saw them for sale on Amazon. I ordered 2 packages. But, I received 1 package of Red Tart Cherries and, like another reviewer, the second package was a package of Gooseberries. Plus, each and every can of the Cherries was dented badly. So I could not use anything from this order. I must say that Amazon was wonderful with this issue and gave me a refund with no hassle. This is my first problem with an order from Amazon after many years of service. So for that I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 star."
2,Not impressed,"Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for making a great cherry pie using these cherries. Sour cherries are hard to come by where I live. However, I was very disappointed. The cherries are a light, pinkish color and are bland and tasteless. I followed the recipe directions inside the label for cherry pie filling, but it still came out a little watery.Overall, I don't think I'll try making cherry pie again unless I can get my hands on some fresh cherries."
2,Oregon Red Tart Cherries,"This was not the product that I ordered, but when I tried to return the case, Returns were not allowed. I gave the case to a friend and have no idea whether or not they liked the cherries. I then ordered the Queen Anne white cherries that I originally wanted from a different source. We haven't tried them yet , but that's what is called for in the recipe that we have, so I expect that we'll be satisfied, even though the cherries actually cost double the amount because of the error."
4,the best metalcomp cd ever!!!,"I am a huge fan of almost all the roadrunner bands! Especially Sepultura, Soulfly, Spineshank, Coal chamber, and I Really love Killswitch engage!!! (I can't say enough good stuff about them!!)TO find all these great songs on one cd is amazing, I can't believe its all in one place!! I found a Cd I can sit through without having to chang to a better song, There all great!! I really recomend for fellow metalheads and general fans of GOOD AND TRUE rock music to buy this Cd!!!"
5,Roadrunner keeps giving the best metal ever....,"This is the best compilation CD I've listened to. I love the b-sides and unreleased tracks added in. They make the CD even better. It's been great listening to well known metal bands such as Type O Negative and King Diamond along with newer metal like Stone Sour, Glassjaw and Chimaira. This CD as a whole is kick ...! Every metal fan should buy it!"
5,Stole my heart,"This is honestly one of the best compilation CD's that I've ever heard. I strongly recommend it. I feel like what's on the CD, is the basis of what got a lot of today's music started. The track listing is awesome, the rare songs are great. Make sure to pick this one up! :D"
5,the heart of METAL!,"This cd is a must have for anyone who remotely likes the genre of metal music. But of course that is expected from a lable such as Roadrunner how is home to bands such as the mighty Slipknot and Coal Chamber, as well as the now disbanded Fear Factory. This cd includes tracks from all those bands in the form of new tracks, rare tracks or ones that made them what they are today. Get yourself a copy of this album, you will be headbanging for days i assure you."
5,Good Variation,its hard to get a variation of music from a record company like Roadrunner but they pull it off anyways. Great record
5,Those Killer Tracks,"This cd was some really good ... music from some bands That I like,Its not a bad price either for this cd,its reasonable because you get a lot of crazy tracks,well Later."
3,This is a great compilation album for the hardcore metal fan,"This album exhibits what Roadrunner Records is all about, metal. A variety of stylings are offered here from Slipknot to Obituary to Coal Chamber. These bands have helped make Roadrunner Records who they are today. While I have been a fan of Type O Negative and Coal Chamber for years, this album has turned me on to bands that I ordinarily would never have considered listening to. The number of ""hard to find"" songs on this album alone makes it well worth the money! A must for the hard-core metal fan.Available April 29, 2003 - one of Roadrunner Records newest artists - doubleDrive - release titled Blue in the Face"
4,Roadrunner Records rocks my socks.,"Man, this cd is awesome. I got it a few days after it came out, and I've been listening to it ever since. I love the fact that it has some non-released tracks from somewhat new bands, like Stone Sour or Ill Nino, as well as the ""old-school"" touch of some of the older bands like Obituary or Life Of Agony. It's an awesome mix of old and new rock, and everyone should definitely add it to their cd collection."
4,heart of roadrunner,"this is a very well put togeather comp. of roadrunner bands.this cd is well worth it just for the Stone Sour(Rules of evidence),Murderdolls(crash crash),Machinehead(negative creep)and Chimaira(fascination street)b-sides alone.not to mention all the other good songs on it.definately go buy this cd."
4,WOW,An actual compliation that has GOOD songs on it!! I especially like it because it has UNRELEASED songs on the cd. A great buy for someone who is kinda interested in this type of music and wants to check out some great bands or for people who ARE fans of these bands!! Get this CD!!
3,The Heart of Roadrunner,"This is a great compliation from Roadrunner Records. This cd gives a taste of artist from the past to the artist of today that are one the same label. This cd has some great b-sides from Kill Switch Engage, who by the way are on this years Ozzfest, and a killer new track from a Clevaland band called Chimaira. There is also a cover of Nirvana's Negative Creep covered by Machine Head. In addition for all of you Glassjaw fans, do you have the song, Modern Love Story, its on this cd as well. I defiently reccomend The Heart of Roadrunner. Regardless if it is the first time you have heard these artist or you are just looking to add a cd to your collection. Your cd collection isn't complete without this cd."
5,Roadrunner rocks,The Heart of Roadrunner records is an absolutely amazing album. It has some of the best songs by the best Roadrunner artists as well as some rare songs by bands such as Chimaira and the Murderdolls. This album represents Roadrunner Records and its artists very well. I highly recommend this album to everyone!
5,Definately a must have!,"Ok, I saw the track listing for this album and was completely stoaked! I have been a fan of RoadRunner music for a long time now and this was sure to be the icing on the cake! It is the best of RoadRunner essentially. Standout tracks: Machine Head's cover of Nirvana's ""Negative Creep,"" ""In The Unlbind"" - Killwitch Enagage, ""The Posibilities of Life's Destruction"" - Soulfly, and ""fascination street"" by Chimaira. The CD rocks and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good hard CD!"
4,hmmmmmmm,well lets see ive listened to the cd on roadrunner and well even though all the sondskind of bled together where you couldnt change tracks it was still really great. good choice in music and bands. Some of the songs i just kind of skipped through because i didnt want to stay online forever plus i didnt want to listen to some of the bands of which i never heard of. but still the parts of the songs i did hear were really good... But yeah if your going to buy a cd it should be this one because its more than one band like 99 % of the cd's out there...
5,buy this cd,"this is the best compilation i've seen in a long time,this doesnt have any [bad] songs,only the best.deicide,the best death metal band in america,nuff said.great songs from obituary and glassjaw to brujeria. buy this cd!!!"
5,RoadRunner Back With The Greatness,"This CD is the best thing i have heard in along time. it has unbelieveable classic tracks from Sepultura, Coal Chamber and Fear Factory. THe bands that have become the staple and means to which all new metal has had to follow. This cd doesnt only deliver the goods classically, but it has bone crushing new tracks from the new breed of RR bands like like Killswitch Ingage, Stone Sour and murderdolls. Not to Mention that this is the only place you can find unreleased tracks from Soulfly, Glassjaw, Chimaira, and Machine HEAD! ALl this UNbelieveable music and its at super low price of... THis is must have for all metal fans old and new."
5,this cd rocks!!!,"been waiting for months for this cd to come out and i went and bought it the day it came out as soon as the stores opened up.this is an awesome cd.great bands-great music.i am a big fan of stone sour and slipknot and there are songs on here by both plus many other awesome bands like coal chamber, killswitch engage plus many many more.this cd is loaded with 20 terrific songs so if you dont have this cd you should definitely get it.you wont be dissapointed!! i have almost all the artists cds on this cd but this cd has all new songs by all the great bands we know and love all mixed into one killer cd.a definite must have!!!!!"
5,Road Runner Records is #1 from day 1!!!,"From day one, Roadrunner Records was always known for being a genre label...a metal label. For the first time ever (hopefully the first of many to come), we are showing new fans what much of the core Roadrunner fans from years past already know - the classic side of Roadrunner.However, this 20 track album is not just about the classic, it's also about the new breed of metal Roadrunner is pumping. Count 'em, 10 classic cuts from the Roadrunner catalog mixed in with 10 previously unreleased cuts from the newer acts of Roadrunner."
4,Almost every home should have window boxes! Curb Appeal!!,"As a REALTOR(R), I encourage everyone to consider window boxes. They are so much bang for the buck. These are a bit more shallow than most people would prefer so you cannot have as many flowers and will have to water them more often...but the end impact is amazing."
3,"Good, but could be better","This book is obviously aimed at the youngest YuGiOh fans, because it does not have the piano chords, only the notes you sing. However, with these basic notes, many young musicians may be able to come up with their own chords, as I have had to. I do wish they'd release another songbook that includes the chords, but for now I will have to be satisfied with this. It definitely is fun to look at the lyrics, many of which I've had a hard time hearing on the album. Now at least I know for certain what's being said!"
4,oh wow!,"i think this was great! i am a total yu-gi-oh! otaku (obessed fan) and i really wished they made the lyrics, as to how i didnt understand half of what the people were singing in track 6, duel madness... oy... i was hoping that there would be instrumental versions, especailly for violin, viola, cello, base, and, oh yeah... piano... i totally am really happy they made this, and it would be cool for Dan Green to like sing a song... *sigh* (dan green is the voice actor who plays yugi and yami yugi) but still. yay!"
1,Eeeeeew!!!!,One of the worst Dragonlance or Fantasy books i have ever read (if not THE worst). The characters are so shallow that it reminds me of those children fairy tales. The plot is laughable. The author has dishonored Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis. Let's hope this will be her last DL book. Anyone who loves this book should try to read the old Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis books before they give their reviews!!!!!
2,dissapointing compared to the others,"This book was a great let down. It really went no where and only accoplished little. The ending is not really that, just a sort of hang on until the next book. It is a pit because the other books by Jean Rabe are really good. Well they can't all be master peices"
1,One of the worst books I ever read!,"This is one of the worst books I ever read. The plot was non existint, and there was no charactor development. In short, save your money until Weiss and Hickman are back."
1,Ack!,"Well, so much for maintaining old standards. Dragonlance is a series that focuses on characters and emotions. Weis and Hickman excel in drawing readers into the emotional drama of their people. I'm sorry to say Jean Rabe lacks this skill. The characters in the 5th age barely keep my interest, never mind my involvment. Can anyone seriously say that characters like Feril or Rig are as intriguing as Raistlin or Sturm? Even Palin is a drag. Old characters, like Goldmoon and Gilthanas, are thrown into the 5th age mix in a gratuitous effort to gain the readership of original fans. They are shells of their original selves. If Jean Rabe wants to write, I suggest trying the Forgotten Realms series, where generic dungeons and dragons stories seem to be welcome, and leave Krynn alone. (Sorry if I offend FR fans!) Bring back Weis and Hickman!!"
2,"Shallow, dull, and plenty of filler","Honestly, Rabe could have done MUCH better. Did you notice that 50 pages of the book was merely Dhamon and crew on the boat fighting? It was horrible. ""Dhamon ducked, sliced, and then came round while Rig..."". That one on for quite some time. Spare me this filler. The other parts were dull, and historically incorrect. Palin, the world's most powerful sorcerer, seemed to be equal in power with all those Skull (thorn?) knights. Magic's gone! The whole quest is to restore magic! Yet they STILL have as much power as before already! sigh....."
1,What happened here?,"I've read and bought every dragonlance novel ever published. And for that very same reason, i also read/bought these dissapointing fifth age books. I mean seriously folks, besides the twins books and a couple of others, all of the dragon lance books were pretty dismal. (books about every race possible... even the gully dwarfs) I was entirely surprised when the sea elves got there own book. *sigh* I was happy when Summer Flame came out, because i thought that it was over, but no... now there is fifth age. All I ask is for TSR (or should I say WOTC) to get another writer (say terry brooks or goodkind) to pencil in a couple of series to rekindle the dragonlance fire."
2,Poor introduction to the Fifth Age,"This was supposed to be the last book in the trilogy. However, it failed to wrap up many of the mysteries presented in the first two novels. In fact, it seemed to generate even more questions at the end then it answered. Case and point (trying not to spoil the story), the wolf changing when hit by a dragonclaw. Was it a wolf or something more? Perhaps the creature that deafened Growler in the first place acting as a guardian? Unless the author intended on developing these characters in later single novels, then reading these stories was a complete waste of time."
4,Better then I thought...,"Jean did a better job of this series then I suspected. She has the writing talents needed, but just not all the facts. I'm not trying to be rude when I say this, Jean, but the time and events within the series went by way to fast, and more things about Krynn (And Kender) should be considered and reviewed before hand. But other then that, I thought it was great. :)"
5,A great follow up to the DragonLance series.,"I thought this book was very well written and the new characters were extremely fascinating. I have read Summer Flame and was compelled to read on when I heard that they made a new trilogy after the Chaos War. I also read the other two novels and was mystified when Fury vanished and they went looking for magical items like the Crown of Tides, which made me want to get deeper into the story and the fact Khellendros wanted Kitiara to be reborn kept me into the story for a long time."
2,Many loopholes in story.,As one of the biggest DL lovers I know I am less than thrilled with the fith age books> The characters lack any presence and the fights any thrills I wish these books were better.I am looking forward to the new books:::::::Maylx
2,A failure to keep up with the old standards.,"The book was not bad, however, it lacked many simple logical parts, for example, why, in the world would the dragons be attacked, when they all are together? In my opinion, it is not that hard to fake a attack of one dragon on another dragon's realm, then we have a two-three month Dragon Purge, a couple of dragons left over and then, just finish them up. Also I would recommend anyone to read this book only, if he can borrow it from his friend or local library. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT!"
2,Disappointing,"It was an okay book, but altogether I expect more from Dragonlance and I think that the whole trilogy was a flop, plus I could barely get through some of the more boring parts of the book. The characters were uninteresting and even some of my old favorites from previous books were very boring in these books and I could barely tell that they were meant to be the same people. There wasn't enough description at some of the crucial or potentially interesting parts of the book and to much description in the boring parts of the book. The plot had potential but was poorly handled and very confusing at times even to the most avid Dragonlance reader. I was disappointed in the whole trilogy."
1,Spiraling into Confusion,"Just so I had a better understanding of characters and events from other Dragonlance authors that appeared in Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's new 2001 trilogy (that I wasn't reading until 2010), I read all three of Jean Rabe's Dragons of a New Age Trilogy. That is potentially the only reason I see to read the conclusion, Eve of the Maelstrom.However, a reader could skip this confused, jumbled, straight out of bad night at the roleplaying game table catastrophe and he or she would still perfectly understand what is going on in the War of Souls.This book lacks basic character development, basic plot cohesiveness, basic pacing, basic sensible dialog, essentially basic everything. It is not worth the time to read it."
2,Keep Trying,"Yet again, I'm sorry for this. Why would a 500 ft., aspiring to become a god, magically talented dragon be vanquished by a normal guy and a girl with a helmet that functions as a squirt gun? Why would people wait to go after dragons when they're all together? WHY DID ANYONE LET THIS BOOK GET PUBLISHED???? I apologize if I offended anyone."
1,Ugh!,"Oh dear. Just when I thought things couldn't get worse... The conclusion of the trite artifact-hunt which has been the focus of this trilogy sees the Great Dragons being uncharacteristically co-operative in helping Malystryx acheive her aims. The Shadow Sorcerer's true colours are revealed (what a surprise...), and our inept adventurers--still searching for personalities--find themselves confronted by all five Great Dragons at once. Rabe's storytelling is still boring, Blister's glove-changing still gets on my nerves, and this is an awful way to end a trilogy which started abyssmally enough in the first place."
2,What this isn't finished.,"This would be better if it was finished, I like the charactors I like some of the ideas but theres no style or feeling to these books. I am so glad that weis and hickman are doing the next ones."
2,Bad characters and plot.,"I must say that this book is a disappointment. The characters do not live up to the series, and neither does the plot. They are empty, and I suspect this book was made for the sole purpose of setting the stage for another book (at least it better be from the quality). That is a terrible reason to write a book, for several reasons that I won't go over here. This book could be improved in quality by giving the characters some more depth and making the plot a little more complicated. They have a tradition to live up to!"
2,The Eve of the Malestrom,"This book did have some good parts. And I will agree with ""TheDoomBrigade@yahoo.com"" in this: if a reader thinks a book is bad, just because it is different, they ARE narrow minded. But I don't dislike this book because it is different. In fact, I was looking forward to the changes of Krynn. And in my opinion, they weren't stressed enough. I also don't mind if a writer has a different style of writing than Margaret and Tracy. But with all that in mind, I still say, Jean Rabe did a terrible job on this book. It doesn't matter if the purpose of this book was just to set the scene for the next ones, it still could have been done better. I think Jean Rabe has potential. But I hope beyond hope, that if she ever wants to write DL again, she will first learn all she can about Krynn. It wouldn't hurt if she read a few reviews either, to see what she's doing wrong."
2,A review of the entire trilogy,"Gee uummm let me see here..... Rabe's characters are obviously immortal since almost every character lives through impossible odds. I'll give the examle of when a small group of warriors successfully destroy seven knights of Takhisis ships and no one is dead. The plot is also shallow (I won't go into that though, since everyone else already has). However I ike the great dragon overlord idea. But too many things that could have been good went bad."
5,"Good, yet bad","In this the last book of the Dawning of A New Age trilogy, is a good ending to it. To make it simple, the heros Dhamon, Rig, Blister, Groller, Feril, Palin, Usha, Ulin, Gilanthas, Silvara, and Fury, continue the battle against the Dragon Overlords and the unfortunate loss of one of them,(not Dhamon) but the return of a important classic Character. For those of you who have read this trilogy know that Margret Weis and Tracy Hickman are working on a new trilogy to begin where Jean left off. If you have any comments or questions e-mail me or add me to your ICQ. (if you have it.)I am known as Stonegrinder on ICQ."
1,A Blight on a Good Name,"It is a shame that Dragonlance has allowed someone who writes this poor to launch it's new novel line, and I think someone at TSR must agree. If you read this book, as well as the others in the trilogy, and then read Dragons of the Fallen Sun, you can see many inconsistancies and a few attempts to reverse the damage this trilogy has done. My advice is skip this trilogy and read the new stuff by the talented writers."
2,it's ok....,"There's several things I don't like about this book, and the series for that matter. She's a good writer and so on but who gave her permission to mess up everything? And the one thing that bothered me the most is that she took magic away from the whole series. That's what Dragonlance is sorta based on is magic. I bet Raistlin is not happy with that!"
2,Just O K,"If you have a couple of hours to kill and want to read a short, simple, mystery story then go ahead and read this book. Otherwise, don't bother."
5,"A very colorful book with a great ""Dad"" ending",This is a fun book for toddlers to preschoolers. It's bright illustrations are a great way to teach colors and include animal antics. The ending has a dad as the best playmate of all. A great gift for Fathers Day or any day to celebrate a great dad.
1,"E for effort, but no cigar",There are just too many genuinely useful books on NLP around to make this one worth reading.
5,Non può mancare!!!,Questa raccolta delle cose migliori di Martin Circus non deve mancare a chi ama la prog dei '70. Vi assicuro che vale molto più di quel che costa.Veramente raccomandato. Peccato che manchi un libretto con info sulle registrazioni sui musicisti e manchino del tutto i testi....comunque i brani sono notevoli.
5,Gorgeous bottle with an elegant scent!,"This is one of the most beautiful, unique perfume bottle I have ever seen! Shaped like an apple in a gorgeous purple with intricate gold design, it is so detailed that even the ""sprayer"" of the bottle is in the shape of a stem! How cute is that sitting on your vanity?If that wasn't enough for any perfume collector, the scent itself is so unique, not at all like the ""popular"" scent the market is infested with that just smells the same and ordinary! It's a sensual scent, that is romantic yet, ""woodsy"" at the same time. Some won't like it because it is definitely not ""floral"" but rather oriental woodsy, but unlike most oriental, it is not over powering, but rather, crisp and light enough to wear during the day and even the summer!This scent is so unique, it can easily be a ""signature"" scent all female crave to discover for themselves!"
1,Million dollard bust,"I'm sorry but I didn't finish it. I think that it is a badly written novel, even if the idea behind is good. Did not capture my interest or sustain my attention. Not to finish a book is way out of the ordinary for me. Usually I like to go through it, wathever the energy required."
4,Solid AOR from the New Monkees Member!!!,"Remember the New Monkees group that toured in the late 80's/early 90's & replaced the Monkees of old? Well if not, that is ok but the singer/guitarist Larry Saltis is also the singer for this solid AOR CD. When It All Falls Down is worth the price of this CD alone. Other noteworthy songs are Talking To Sarah, Moonlight, A Little Bit Of Fire, Surrender and Stop Running. If you like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard or Danger Danger this CD is worth the price. It is getting harder and harder to find so don't miss out."
1,A game for the kids... and the kids will not play.,"I'm not a GBA expert, don't get me wrong. But this game is clearly for kids, 10-year-olds are not going to be interested in this game, for all I know.. And this game is too hard even for me, an expect gamer. The game controls are a little complicated to use, because you don't know for sure if you're going to jump on the plataform of if you're going to fall. The graphics, on the other hand, are awesome for a GBA, really impressive, unbelievable. But this isn't enough to make this game a good one. Prefer to watch a trailer or see some screenshots, to see the graphics. But don't play it, unless you'll be very disappointed."
4,Latin Jazz that cooks,"This Latin Jazz mixes up some funk rhythms, ballsy horns, and spirited singing to deliver a high-energy album that makes you want to jump up and dance. If you like the Fania All-Stars sound, this will appeal, though that rocks more, and this takes off more from James Brown. Barretto is a legendary conga player who played with Tito Puente in the fifties, then had a hit with ""The Watusi"" which is included here."
1,Tiny Box,You could get 1oz box for this price. I didn't realize im spending this much money on this tiny little box. Goto Petco and get 1oz for the same price.
4,"Wonderful book, best introduction to basic economic ideas","I bought 1 copy of this book for my 13-year old nephew, but kept it for myself (I'm 25). Now, I'm getting a few more. It is just so well-written, I couldn't let go of it. Some of my friends, who are usually uninterested in politics or economics, read it almost nonstop with pleasure. At least they now understand the basic idea of a voluntary free-market society and how it's different from our society today. Even if they disagree, at least they know better than to misinterpret the free-market issues due to ignorance.The only gripe about this book is that a few chapters are a bit formulaic and sometimes don't make the underlying concept as clear as other chapters do. It appears to me that the author didn't take enough time to develop his ideas well enough in those few chapters. I hope he will clarify them in the next edition."
5,Excellent,"This is definitely one of my favorite books. Yeah, it has that trashy romance thing going on, but it is definitely a lot more than that. Also, the main charcater has tons of spunk, and is really rather liberated."
2,It's Been Done Before,"The only Adler book I can give five stars to is ""The Rich Shall Inherit,"" because I adored Poppy, the main character, and the story-line was riveting.But ""Leonie"" is a hollow, unsatisfying character, and her main purpose in life seems to be jumping from man to man and moving the (somewhat stilted) plot along. Her love/hate relationship with Monsieur is at first entertaining, but his life-long obsession with her seems overplayed, and we never get a real idea of what makes him tick. And people always seem to die at such convenient points in this book; it began to get annoying. I hate to bring up real life in a book about pure fantasy--which is what all Adler's books are about--but there isn't enough reality in this book to give the fantasy something to stand on.Bottom line: in a book wherein everything you want to happen is inevitably going to, the journey there should be entertaining enough to make it work anyway. And in ""Leonie,"" it isn't."
2,This book could have been much shorter . . .,"To me it seemed that Léonie didn't have many facets to her personality other than that of a good, sweet person, far sweeter than she should have been given her circumstances. Her daughter was pretty much the same. Oh, Léonie was lucky of course - inexplicably so and mostly because of her astounding beauty. It really was quite annoying how every man she ever came across seemed to fall in love with her in less than a day. I mean, how beautiful can she be? She had far too many lovers, most of them rather unnecessary. So much of the story could have been removed without harming the plot at all. Most of it was written just to make the book longer, it seemed. After a couple hundred pages it just gets boring and repetitive."
1,"terrible idea, lame graphics, junky technology","This game is a shoddy, shameless mercantile exploitation of so-called christianity. Beyond the obvious moral hypocricy of convert-or-be-killed (such a very Spanish Inquisition approach), the game does not have its technology in order - specs are missing, video card incompatibility, lame graphics, slow play... the game is huge waste of time and money, pretty much a rip... and no doubt rushed to market in time for christmas, not tested well... reeks of amateur development.I wish Amazon had a negative stars rating."
3,Left Behind cd rom game,This game is a christian based game about the appacolipse and the trials you may face being left behind. it comes with the book and game.
1,Really?!?,How can Amazon sell something that is so offensive. This game promotes hate crimes! Should Atheists be allowed to punch Christians that come to our doors when we can't convert them?!? Is that the behavior that Christians promote? If you don't see it my way then die! I hope that Amazon will remove this and be more mindful of what they choose to sell. Unbelievable!!
1,Amazon Should Remove This Hateful Game,"Killing Jews and Atheists that won't be converted!!!! This is wrong on every level!!! Amazon, you really should remove this hateful crap from you website and stop contributing to HATE!!!!!!Left Behind: Eternal Forces"
1,Thou Shalt Not Kill...unless it's a hecka fun videogame,Wow! This game is great. Forget what the detractors are saying. You get to kill people that aren't Christians and then pray your guilt away. Just like in real life! I can't wait for the Pat Robertson Pray Pray Revolution game next!
2,I have mixed feelings,"So I bought this game because I thought the concept was interesting but after playing it for a little while lost interest. I would agree with other reviewer that it definatly felt like it was a rush job for christmas and luckily I have and Alienware PC the met the requirements. I would compare the game to that developed by the US Army. It's and ok game but it was created with and underlying message. So the only thing I will say that was ""Left Behind"" were the average gamers who don't have the system requirements to play this game.On a personal note. Games like this are made to stir people up. I mean think about it. If EA or any other major game manufacture had developed this game you would have had the option to play the side of the Anti-christ. So that's my thought."
4,A good Christian Game,"This game is not best, most up-to-date game in the world. I will acknowledge that. It is, however a good quality game for Christians to play as an alternative to D&D or other role playing games with non-Christian themes. Yes, the graphics are old, but the theme of the game really makes up for it. Christians should buy the game. We should be supporting our Christian video game options. If we don't then there is no incentive to produce others for the manufacturers. Other items to try are Dance Praise revolution and Odyssey products."
2,Not truly auto-set,"I didn't do my homework well enough before purchasing this clock. I bought it to replace a nearly identical and several year old La Crosse atomic wall clock that stopped working. This is not an atomic clock. You have to set the date and time manually on a small, rear facing, LCD clock located on the back. A litium battery keeps that clock running and the front, analog, clock sets itself to what ever time is on the the LCD clock. It is only as accurate as the small LCD clock. There is no external (automatic) time syncing. The front of the clock automatically sets itself to the time that you manually set on the rear facing clock. The whole thing seems pointless to me."
3,Looks nice.,"I had a little trouble getting the clock to work, but now that I finally got it, it is working well. It looks good too."
2,Overpriced and slightly out of date,"Don't buy this book I got ripped off, I have been a seamstress for 25 years and doing bridal for 5 years I am always looking for new techniques but this is basic construction.This is way overpriced and the information in it can be found on the internet for free.The dress designs this book refers to are no longer in production.Any one who sews and knows about garment construction and has a little common sense when it comes to sewing does not need this book. There is no substitute for learning as you go. Go to the Thrift store, Goodwill, Salvation Army or yard sales pick up a gown cheap take it home and practice on it. Any sewing book by Palmer and Pletch covers the same basic information and is a lot cheaper.Anything related to bridal is overpriced and I should have known this before I purchased this book and got ripped off."
3,It's okay,Well as I said about other books in the 21th century I expect much more when I read a book from which I am learning something.
1,Rip off,"This is small (about 5""x8"") 140 page paperback book. Way too overpriced for the content. I ordered it to get info on fixing a gaping front neckline. The information was not adequate. I got my answer from an experienced seamtress."
4,Scammed,"Book: How to Alter a Bridal GOwn by Susan Ormand. I feel cheated and scammed. I ordered this book ($40 used) over a month ago. Was supposed to be shipped between May 7-10. I still have not received. I have sent two e-mails to the seller and have never had a response, not a thank you for your order, not a shipping notice. not a response or explanation as to why I haven not received.. This is no way to treat a customer.."
5,Hail Herodotus!,"I love this book. Full of tall tales and true history. Half the pleasure is sorting it out for yourself. Persia versus Greece. The 300 spartans at Thermopylae. Marathon to Salamis. With side histories in Lydia, Egypt, Scythia, et al. Find out how the brick for the pyramids was truly gathered."
2,NO MAPS?!?!,"The text for this Kindle edition is great, but I bought this book for my college course ""The Greek World."" That said, it is a given that I need to see the maps included in the print edition of this book in order to effectively take my exams! I am shocked that they are not included and very upset that I can't study for my upcoming map test. Why would a figure so important be omitted from the Kindle edition? I am not pleased."
4,What a fun read-aloud!,"I will not cover the historical significance of this text; it's been done elsewhere, better than I could. I will say, however, that it's been a hoot to hear it read out loud. My 10th grade son is reading it to me, and we laugh often at the author's quirks. It's like listening to grandpa tell tales of the old day, with many round-abouts and never-the-lesses. If not for the history, read it for the storytelling within."
3,Original and Informative,"Herodotus who is considered the Father of History, presents his view of the peoples of the ancient world in a concise (considering how much he crams into 600 pages) manner and gives us insight into civilizations we otherwise would know nothing about. I enjoy his descriptions of Egypt, Greece, Persia, Babylon, and others. His personal bias comes through many times. For instance he calls wife selling in Babylon a ""sound practice."" Also as a Greek, he has great aversion to the Persians who attacked his nation many times though he attempts to view them objectively. Overall, the language is verbose, the names are more numerous and difficult than the Old Testament, and many areas seem irrelevant. If you enjoy ancient history I suggest you read these works."
2,not for me,"This is a long, rambling, unfocused book. I guess the other reviewers are interested in everything covered here, but I wasn't. I tried this book after reading Thucydides. Thucydides has focus. Herodotus does not. Herodotus seems like the ancient equivalent of soap operas. I couldn't get through it."
5,A wonderful book,"This is simply a wonderful book and an entertaining read. Herodotus set out to do for the Persian wars what Homer did for the Trojan war. The Homeric elements are apparent throughout the book. To a very real extent, partly because of his huge popularity down through the ages, Herodotus defines the stage upon which we all act even today. Only the last 75-100 pages are marred buy the influence of the anti-Spartan/pro-Athenian sentiment of his time."
3,Review of Penguin Classics Herodotus,"While I found the material entertaining and the translation laudable, I can't help but criticize the format of this work in light of similar, but better, editions. I speak specifically of ""The Landmark Herodotus,"" by Strassler. I haven't actually read the work, but I've read its counterpart, ""The Landmark Thucydides,"" and found it to be a large improvement over similar editions.This book is easy enough to follow, but at times drags on. If you don't mind having a larger book in front of you, I recommend the Strassler edition, which features extensive maps and footnotes (this work only had endnotes)."
3,Sometimes faster isn't always better,"I have a fiberglass pool and the robot does a nice job of cleaning the bottom and sides. It does not do well at negotiating the 3 steps, (gets 1/2 way up the first step and comes back down). Cleaning the included pouch style filter is a royal PIA with muck getting stuck in the corners of the pouch. The included cloth bag has torn at the seam 4 times and needed replacement. I'd wait for the next version."
1,Stopped working after 2 years,"Used it once a week for 2 years then one day it just quit running. Cleans great no problem there, really liked it, was very disappointed when it stopped working under light-duty conditions. Saw others online had the same problem and had poor results with IRobot service response. This product/company isn't really ready for prime time yet, they have no business charging +$1K for something that only lasts 100 runs. Of course it will fail, the transmission box rocks back and forth because it's not stiff enough and poorly attach to the body. Expect to see additional complaints like this as more units reach their 100-cycle fatigue life. Don't waste your money, at $10 per cleaning, it isn't worth the price."
4,Pretty good in clearing the bottom of my pool,"I purchased this robot after my water powered cleaner couldn't do the trick of clarifying my water.My first impression is positive, as it cleared 80% of the dirt.The only drawback is probably it's steep cost."
4,"Complete is great, but less than definitive conducting","OK - I love to finally hear every note of Korngold's epic ""Sea Hawk"" score. But this recording for all its digital clarity falls well short of the panache & brio of the except recordings conducted by Charles Gerhardt. Plus the lamentable diction of the Russian chorus & soloist doesn't help."
5,THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ,"This is truly a fascinating, life changing book. If you are willing to change your beliefs, this book will alter forever the way you view health and your innate capacity to heal yourself. Faith in the procedure,from shamanism to high-tech treatments, brings about healing. Bye bye dogmas and rivalries for the best methods of treating disease. Your health is in your mind.This is revolutionary."
5,Depends on the size of the chips,"This case does make a very convenient transport for one's poker chips. Because my two sets of plastic poker chips are from two different companies, and one set is thinner than the other, I believe it could hold more than 200 of my chips. I think it must be due the disparity of sizes in my poker chips that the one problem I have with the case is that the chips can get out of the wells even when it is closed. A lining for the chip columns would also be a nice touch."
5,Harper Collins Treasury of Picture Book Classics,This is a great book with classic stories. Kids can read along or just enjoy the pictures while being read to by others.
5,Fabulous book!,"As a librarian, I wrote a grant for family literacy and gave this book to each family that attended our family literacy programs. It was like giving them a starter library for their home! I have since bought this book for family members and friends. I retired recently and now care for my 2 year old grandaughter while her parents work. This book is part of our daily reading. She LOVES it, and there is no bedtime until we've read Caps for Sale. This book is a BARGAIN and I would recommend purchasing any of the books included in the collection, but you can save a ton of money by just buying this one!"
3,It's alright,"This book is just alright. Sure.. it has a lot of good classics like goodnight moon and harold and the purple crayon.. and I even enjoyed george shrinks and petes a pizza. But the rest of these books aren't that great. There's one about having another kid.. so if you're not planning to and don't want your kid excited about a baby brother or sister it could be a bad book to read them. The Eric Carle book and caps for sale are both repetitive and annoying. Leo the late bloomer and williams doll seem too specifically aimed at kids who are raised in homes who care about gender.. I'm not sure either really fit with the times anymore. Half of these books I don't really want to read again, I plan on just putting this book on a back shelf somewhere."
5,A Great Collection,My daughter loves the stories in this thoughtfully put together collection. She can pick out which story she wants by looking at the cover of the book.
5,Fantastic Compilation!,"I am beyond pleased with this lovely compilation of classic picture books. The paper is high-quality and I especially appreciate that each book is reproduced in its original full-page format. My three year-old adores this latest addition to our library and we've already read several of the books many times (her current favorite is Harold and the Purple Crayon) since getting it a couple days ago. I cannot recommend this item enough. For just over $25, it's a fantastic deal! If you're looking for a treasury of picture books, this is a great choice."
1,Wrong Motorola Charger Sent,"I was excited to purchase the Motorola charger for my Motorola TalkAbout portable radios. They work great for hiking. Unfortunately, I received the wrong charger and it won't charge my radios. The adapter I received is 6.5 vdc 200ma and the one required to charge my radios is a 11 vdc 55ma. Will have to return and try again."
3,Using It for Feminist Course,It is a good anthology but it does have it's flaws of containing too many views to explain them all well and condensing longer writings.
2,Poor Quality,"I received this item as a gift and thought it would be practical to carry to different rehearsals. However, for the price, did not last long. The description states that it is impact resistant, however, when tipped over by accident, something jammed which made me unable to fold it correctly or make it compact in any way. When I would need to move it about a foot or so in any direction, it was difficult to pick it up and move it because the legs would fall out from underneath it. It's made of cheap plastic. Not recommended."
1,Horrible Deceptive Not as advertised!,Bought this for my father for Christmas. Very Very disappointed with this product! Not as advertised at all. Does not split apart...does not have the advertised items and is extremely small. Like a small lunch cooler. Not worth the money at all. Could have purchased something much better for much much less at Wal Mart.
4,LIttle but nice and neat,"Bought this product for my brother, because someone broke into his car and stole the nice one that he had. After I read the the review and decided to buy it. The product came home faster than we expected and it's a great product. So many compartment to fit all his baits and everything else that he needed. The bag look small but handy. I will recomended for a friend."
1,Problem TV,"I purchased this plasma TV 18 mths ago for approx $4500, in addition to a wall bracket for $250. Two months ago there was a loud 'pop' and the picture went out. Sony customer service advised me to take it to their service center in San Diego. I did so and was charged $700 for a new power system. I was informed by the technician that it is a common problem. I wrote a letter to Sony but was informed that the warranty expires after one year. Could not recommend this model."
1,Disappointed at Year 2,I bought this tv almost 2 years ago and paid almost 5000 for it. Today I am planning to spend 1000 more to replace a screen part because 2 weeks ago I began to get only a white screen when ever I turned the tv on. Who would believe that such a tv would only last 2 years with no maintenance required. I used the repair section on sony.com and selected a repair service in the area. The repair person who came to look at my set did not seem surprised about the problem. Therefore I would be cautious about the purchase of another plasma.
2,Poof !,"Love the TV screen and box design. Problem, as w/ another reviewer, is the screen went blank. Purchased in Jan of 2003 and last week, after a mere 3 yrs, sparks flew fr the back and 2 pops were heard. The screen went blank and either the TV is worthless,considering what you can now get for $1k plus, or I'm in for a near $1k repair. Sony should be ashamed that one of their high end products has such a short shelf life. Yes, I called Sony and they referred me to an authorized repair person."
5,Ashly Quality Can't Be Beat for the Money,"Already had one of these in use in my sound business. It worked perfect for EQing the speaker tone. Went looking for another for another system and found that it was no longer available. Found one new on Amazon rather than take a chance on eBay. Ashly is solidly built, reliable and sonically precise."
3,May-December Stuff for the Dirt of it,"I read this one first and liked the somewhat immature but biting writing, as well as various insights into May-December affairs. But here, too, Sohn cuts to the sex so fast so often that it becomes difficult to fathom how these folks can be so mindless in their sexual romps."
1,Tedious,"As another reviewer put it, this book was a chore to read. I don't know why I stuck with it, but I hate to not finish a book. The characters are so poorly drawn that it's impossible to care about any of them. They're also unlikeable for the most part. Others have commented on how Rachel continues to be drawn to Hank in spite of the fact that he's so mean and misogynistic. That's true, but I also can't see what Hank sees in Rachel -- I can't see the appeal. The dialog was completely unbelievable, and the story dragged. In all, a waste of time. In the end I dropped it in the trash, which I never do because I love books. I just wanted to protect other innocents from this drivel."
2,Never finished,"I have to say I was disappointed in this book. Did not finish it. Other efforts by the author are brilliant, but this one seemed from a different person."
5,Love this line of CD's!,"I own a few of these CD's and love them. I teach in an Early Intervention center (2-3 year olds) and use these CD's during activities like yoga, sensory play, and snack time. Very relaxing. Sometimes I want to listen to them at home!"
4,"Full of information, but,","This book is full of great information and great illustrations for the backyard bird watcher. My problem is unless you know the name of the bird (which I am trying to find out) then it is difficult to look it up. We also have National Audubon Society Field Guide to Birds which is broken down into types of bird (i.e.perching) and then broken down by color. So, for a novice, the smithsonian is a little more time consuming."
3,A good index would help,"As the other reviewers have pointed out, this book covers every bird that has ever been seen in FL (well, not counting the dusky-headed parakeet we saw south of Tampa), but the index is terrible. On arrival in Florida we saw two egrets, one of which I knew was a great egret and other of which I knew was a snowy egret - but which was which? Unfortunately, when I went to the index for page numbers, all that was listed under ""egrets"" was cattle egret and rusty egret. The others were listed by their latin names only in another listing. The information was in the book, but not to be found through the index. The same with herons - the index lists only great blue, green, little blue and tricolored, although the book also includes info on the black crowned night-heron, and yellow crowned night-heron, both permanent Florida residents. I turned back to my Sibley's almost immediately because I had lost confidence in this book. Better books are available in Florida."
3,Must have with caveat,"An excellent book for identifying birds. Anyone interested in Florida birds can use this book. However, its main drawback is that it offers very few specifics on when and where to find these birds IN FLORIDA. The main reason to consider a book on FLORIDA BIRDS is that it will tell you how to find these birds IN FLORIDA. For example, it states that the Swallow-tailed Kite is listed as endangered in South Carolina, which is unfortunate to be sure, but totally useless to finding this bird in Florida."
4,Birds Of Florida,The book is all inclusive as far as birds go and the break down for each bird is so very much also. The pages before the individual birds is all comprehensive too. The one thing I would criticize would be is the size (to small)of print but at the same time it could not be larger and fit so nicely into such as this.
2,"Good Food, Bad History","I was excited when I first heard about this book, but when I got a copy, I was quite disappointed.First the good... the recipes produce tasty dishes.But they are not the recipes of Spain's Jews, secret or public.These are recipes invented by the authors with a minimum of supporting evidence, or, in fact, most of the time, none at all.They are based for the most part on the testimony of people who turned in Conversos for being ""secrect Jews"". The mere mention of, oh, say, chick peas and honey, has led the authors to invent a recipe that includes these ingredients.If you are truly interested in the history the food eaten by Spain's Jews, you will not learn much. If you want some nice Spainish-style recipes eaten by Jews, you'll probably do better skipping the sad tales of betrayal and torture and buying a modern Sephardic cookbook."
1,Horrible,This trampoline is aweful! I bought it 2-3 years ago and it is falling apart. The blue padding is all shreded and the white foam pads are in pieces. I know people who bought other trampolines and have had no problems. I do not suggest this trampoline for anyone.
3,Pretty Good,"This is a good screen protector and body protector for the DS lite. It does protect from scratches on the screen. It also prtects around D-pad and the buttons. It also prtects the front of the DS lite. The price was a little on the expensive side with shipping, but it's pretty good if you don't want a bulky case. (It doesn't protect the bottom though.)"
3,"Useful, but can be frustrating","I was surprised when I opened the package, and found that it had protective filters for some of the plastic parts of the DS, in addition to the screens. I have not used those parts, and don't plan to (I'm planning on getting a skin, so they'd just have to come off eventually, anyway). The cleaning cloth works well, the screen filters go on easily enough, and the directions are pretty clear -- make sure you read them, if only to be sure you're putting the right filter on the right screen. The only down side is that it can be difficult getting the air bubbles out when you apply them. I found that removing and slowly reapplying while pressing down with the length of my finger worked for the upper screen, but for some reason I just have not been able to apply the bottom filter without getting an air bubble in the middle. This is especially vexing since protecting the touch screen is the reason I bought the product in the first place."
1,PIECES O' CRAP!!!,"Well, I just got this today at Target. I thought that they would help take away the fingerprints from the outside of my black DS Lite, so that was my only reason to get them. Truth is, EVERYTHING IN HERE SUCKS!!!! The screen protectors are full of bubbles that come out but return 5 minutes later, the inner D-Pad/ Button protectors show tons of fingerprints, and the outside is the same as the dS is regularly... Covered in fingerprints!! The only advantage is that there's a cloth that you can ue to wipe of the fingerprints on the outside really easily, but I didn't have the intention of bothering with fingerprints at all! If that's the same situation you're facing, [...]."
4,"Good book, but geared for really serious people","The book is great, and covers many issues everyone needs to know about. However, unless you are a well paid professional photographer many of the organizational and backup tools will not apply to you.For example, while shooting on the field, he recommends backing up data on two external devices and a laptop. At home, he suggests creating dvd archives (two sets), having RAID, JBOD or another type of failsafe, along with a NAS server setup and perhaps backing up a few more copies away from your house / work. Quite excessive, even for the serious photographer.But if you can look past that, there are some brilliant, lasting organizational techinques that require skill and practice, and will serve you well."
5,A Book I needed,"A shot in the arm to all of us who work with digital photos and need to be more organized, about the photos themselves, and the backup process."
3,Facing reality,"If you are browsing for this or similar books, that's a sign that you're facing reality: digital photography requires discipline. Discipline, you will get plenty of with Krogh's recipes. Up to you to decide if his file-and-retrieve system meets your exact needs, but surely it will give you food for thought. The 'system' is heavily biased towards using iView, the cataloguing software. Unless you decide to just go for it, you might end up being caught in no-man's land, using Adobe's Bridge more limited features until you figure out if Adobe's new Lightview or Apple's own Aperture could do iView's trick (they probably won't, if you follow Krogh's scriptures quite literally). Perhaps Peter should come up with an updated edition discussing the new options in some detail. All in all, buy the book. It will strengthen your resolve to put order in your picture folders, and do so in a way that will serve you well in the future too."
5,For everyone who hopes to find their digital images.,"If you are a professional photographer awash in thousands of digital images or a serious amatuer, hoping to build a searchable library of photographs, this book will become your manual for organization. The area of cataloging digital photography is quite new and the software needed for the task is changing at a rate difficult to keep up with.Krogh has created the bible of digital image organization. The book is full of tips on how to get started for any size collection. His sense of humor makes this coma inducing topic enjoyable to sort out.With an eye to your ability to expand, knowing that the current software might become obsolete in coming years Krogh seems to cover all the bases.So, if you find yourself wondering where the great photos you made on assignment in Alaska last year are or simply hoping to find the baby photos this is a must read."
4,An Excellent Overview,I found this book to be an excellent resource to help you to understand how all the pieces fit together.
5,Best Peggy Lee tribute to date,"Maria Muldaur, a singer of note in her own right, takes her turn at paying homage to the late Peggy Lee and what a tribute it is . From her song selection, to arrangements, to vocal style, which mimics Lee's subtle phrasing and nuanced swing, Muldaur delivers an album that is captivating. What a joy these songs are to hear by Muldaur. Most tribute make you long to hear the real thing, but Muldaur scores big on this impressive outing. Jazz singer Jeannie Bryson and Seattle based Connie Evingson had recent CD tributes to Lee, but they pale in comparison to Muldaur's work."
5,She Does Peggy Lee Better Than Peggy Lee (to me),"My dad really loved Peggy Lee, so I grew up hearing a lot of her songs. I kind of liked a few of her songs but there was something sort of monotone to me about the way she sang that failed to inspire.I was actually nervous about buying this CD, afraid I would not like it very much. Boy, was I wrong. Maria pumps new life into these songs with a sauciness and bawdiness all her own that livens things up ""just right.""Maria done good on this one - two thumbs up!"
2,"Poor quality, even less than expected","I was not expecting exceptional production for this DVD since most of what is out there for Nusrat is of the same calibre: Home movie type filming, amateur type post-production. But the most annoying thing about this DVD is the fact that about half-way into the program (DVD 2), the audio gets out of sync with video and then it becomes close to impossible to continue watching. My 2 star rate is for the song selection, general ambiance and DVD 1."
5,Delicious,"Hi everyone, I have ""Menieres Disease"", which means I cannot intake of salt, anything other than what my body produces. I like an occasional sweet treat without the guilt, and these pastries work for me. I can control the salt intake, and they are Low Fat, Dairy Free, No Cholesterol, No Butter or Yeast added. My favorites are Maple, Original and Raspberry flavors, but I was very disappointed in the Chocolate and Lime. I have served these to guests with coffee and tea, and they also found this brand to be of high flavor and texture. Lastly, I have tried other brands, and they leave a greasy feel on my palate, ""Barry's"" does not!"
1,Too Expensive,"I Just finished eating French Twist Key Lime...I agree they are delicious, but I paid $3.99 at Foodtown for a 4.5 ounce package, and they are Barry's Bakery. $26.00 is ridiculous...Everyone go to foodtown or any other supermarket. They carry this product much much cheaper."
4,Angel grounded by his humanity.,"A powerful Irish magician travels to LA where he hopes to raise the dreaded giant Balor and rule the world. A Hollywood studio head struggles to keep his job. Kate tries to track down a gang of bank robbers who have killed three people. Doyle has a brain splitting vision of a young girl in trouble. These plots are all part of a puzzle framed by fear, greed, anger and regret. And when the pieces are all fit together a new image of Angel appears more human than we have seen him before except perhaps with Buffy. Trapped by strong magics Angel must face the ultimate death.The story moves at a fast past. The pages are heavy with demons and villians. The fastbacks are kept to a single sad incident. Hollywood and the Otherworld blend surprisingly well together.This is an excellent addition to the Angel series. Even if a reader has never watched the TV shows they can enjoy this book"
1,Terrible AC Invertor,"I bought this product because it wasn't as expensive as other ac invertors. Well, you get what you pay for. From day one, it made a loud buzzing sound. It was so loud that I couldn't use my cell phone in the car. After about 6 months, it overheated and melted into my cigarette light. I would not advise anyone to purchase this product."
1,Really Unrealistic,"This book, along with every single one of the Sweet Valley books, is completely unrealistic. First of all, sixth grade is early to get you period, but the chararacters act as if not having your period by this time means you're a medical abnormality. Plus, the characters are really obsessed with periods, making it seem like a much bigger deal than it is."
3,how dumb,"This book is quite dumb because first of all not getting your period when you're twelve does NOT mean you're abnormal; second, it almost doesn't at all make emotionlly mature - at least not in Jessica and Elizabeth's case and lastly, you don't have lie about it. If you are going to read this book, be prepared for some major ignorence."
1,Dull with a side of awful,"The entire idea behind ""The Path"" is cool, and Ron Marz is up there with Chuck Dixon as on of the best writers around but the real turn-off for ""The Path"" is the art. Crossgen Comics has,until now, been using artists who usually make all the books look like the're done by the same artist, but for some reason crossgen decided to fix something that isn't broken and it has floped in my eyes. The artists give no hint of a third demension and the characters look like paper dolls. The reapeted use of browns make the book dull and less appealing to the eyes. I read other comics from crossgen and will continue to do so but The path will never be one of those comics."
1,Everquest is DEAD.,"Everquest was great when it first came out. It was so addictive that some people even got a divorce to be able to play more. It took up hundres of hours of my free time and I had no regrets. However, that was over 5 years ago.Today, with the release of World of Warcraft, many players have stopped playing Everquest. Populations on all servers are extremely low and guilds are having trouble recruiting people.With that being said, this expansion is simply a waste of money. Dragon raids require many people (usually 20 or more), who are high level (65+), and have the proper resist gear in order to win. There simply isn't enough people playing these days to do the raids, and there aren't any new people playing this game.This expansion should be given away for free, and the monthly subscription needs to be dropped to $0.99. Then, I can propbably ask my old buddies to log in and relive the old times. Otherwise, go buy World of Warcraft and save yourself $20."
4,Marketing Online Made Easy!,"I had to purchase this book as a text for my online marketing class and expected it to be as boring as any other school book, what a surprise. THIS BOOK IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND and kept me interested. It has great tactics and tips for small businesses on the net. It has certainly helped me guide clients in their online marketing for their businesses!"
3,The first book for online marketer.,"I read this book before I have to join with emarketing teamat my office.It makes me understand the online location &How to take the most advantage from the internet marketingenvironment.In my opinion,the last chapter is too shortto implement. Anyway,I always read it again & again,whenI've no idea about Guerrilla tactics."
1,Run away,"Sorry, but this book is sooooooo not real. There are a few pieces of advice worth considering, but 90% of this books ideas won't fly in today's day and age.If you are a budding author wanting to market your book, don't buy this, it won't work - trust me, I tried.On the other hand, if you're an Internet marketer, then most of this book is worth the money and the wait of shipping...."
1,Not his best work,"I'm not someone who has disliked Young MC. In fact, I have always been a big fan, even in the post-Stone Cold Rhymin' years when everyone forgot who he was. So I'm not biased.Having said that, this is a pretty poor album. The lyrics and production are second-rate, generic, uncreative and repetitive. There's not much good that can be said about this album. For those looking to rediscover Young MC in his post-top 40 years, I would reccomend getting any of his other albums besides this one, particularly ""What's The Flavor"", which is a very good album."
3,Not His Best,"I agree that this in not Young's best work, but it's also not as bad as others have indicated. The first song, ""What it Look Like"" is a tight track all the way around. ""OH!"" is a fun track with a catchy chorus that you'll find yourself singing. Young MC is someone who doesn't get enough credit for his talent. However, if you're curious what he's been up to since ""Bust a Move,"" I would recommend picking up ""Brainstorm"" or ""What's the Flavor?"" over this album."
3,An average game; not as good as FREEKSTYLE or MX SUPERFLY.,"Overall, Big Air Freestlye is an okay game with better products on the market. As the title says, the game focuses on freestyle tricks. The controls are okay, but not the best either. The freestyle portions are better than MX SUPERFLY'S, but the lack of any racing modes destroy the replay value. The game's freestyle segments, although interesting, can't hold a candle to FREEKSTYLE'S, Gamecube's best supercross game. There are only 30 tricks, but no way to modify them. This game is okay, just not phenomenal. Only worth buying if you want a motocross game that plays like TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER."
5,Be Basic,This is an excellant addition for anyone wanting to study Genesis. There is so much that is overlooked without some additional comments.
2,Not much you didn't already know...,"I was very disappointed. I read this skimpy 134 page book in about and hour and half last night. I came away with very little (I even thought about quickly sending it back to Amazon). Don't expect any revelations here and don't expect much in the way of web site help either. This may be a ""must read"" for some older agent/broker who thinks the web is his/her enemy. Clearly there are a few of philosophical points and strategies explained but they are NOT rocket science. Save your money or expect a quick unsatisfactory read, believe me. I think the earlier reviews were done by friends. (P.S. I have not read ""8 new rules"" but they discuss them here... #8 is Know What Business You're In... ooooh!). Read ""Cluetrain Manifesto"" or ""New Rules for a New Economy"" if you want real eye-opening insight into the near future."
4,Good value,For the price it is a good investment. It will remind you of some of the old school garnishes that in my opinion look much better than many of the bought garnishes people are using today.
4,tomato rose lol,"Yep it's got a tomato rose like every old garnishing book. I did get a few new ideas, i didn't see before and a better crystalized fruit recipe. yet, its my top five of my garnishing books. Decent pictures. Best part is, great old recipes that everyone thinks is new."
5,Fantastic,I love the step by step instruction and the real life examples. With no formal training I can sketch the way I always wanted to.
5,Great sketching book and MORE,"""Sketching Your Favorite Subjects in Pen & Ink"" is a fantastic book. I'm an artist and art instructor and I had been looking for a thorough book with lots of examples of various subjects. This book is perfect for my students and it's a wonderful source of inspiration for me, too. I might add that folks who enjoy woodburning might really benefit from this book. Many of the techniques could be used in that art as well."
2,1993 hardback had Missing & Repeated chapters,"Do not purchase the 1993 hardback unless you can look at it first. Mine has missing chapters and repeated chapters. A very obvious mistake and it's sad the publisher put this version into circulation. I wanted a hardback so I bought this older version. For that reason I gave it the low stars. Not the authors fault, I assume."
4,Contemporary not Classical,"I used this book at UT in the 80s and dug it out again when my own child was old enough to begin studying rhetoric. We use a classical curriculum in our Home School. This book is solely contemporary rhetoric. It is not Aristotelian. However, having said that. It is a wonderful book at a terrific price. The glossary, appendices, sample passages, notes for polishing writing, index to grammatical terms and more make this one of the best high school and college supplementary reference texts on the market."
2,Crappy hardware,"The cable is just fine and its a hard to find length, however, the eye-bolts provided with this set both snapped *As I was screwing them into 4x4 southern yellow pine posts that were fairly weathered*. The spring also doesn't look like it would handle any real tug by our 70 lb. hound.This is what happens when a company doesn't have the ethical backbone to spend 50 cents extra for decent steel and hardware to ensure your dog doesn't break loose and run off.Do not buy this product. Buy coated cable and go to the local hardware store and buy decent hardware and do it yourself, its pretty easy."
1,Absolutely terrible,"This product is pathetic. How can they sell something that is made to such a low standard. It broke the first day our dog was on it. He is an 85lb GS and he snapped the end that was attached to the spring after less than a few hours or normal use. Luckily I saw it happen or we would likely have lost our dog. I wish I could get my hands on whoever is responsible for this shoddy product, do not buy if you value your dog."
4,perfect,This is product exactly as described. It is also a very good product. It is fairly easy to assemble some tool.s required.
3,no way...,ok so we have a guy trained in the genbukan and bujinkan ok?so what the main part of this dvd?GYMNASTICS!!!! i crap you not his whole style is based around it with some ninjutsu thrown in...good stuff if you wanna be the star of the GYMKATA remake...seriously shows some good ideas and stuff and if gymnastics are your forte in ninjutsu this is all you..me if you do a flip and a handspring comin at me ill laugh becasue you wont have enuff power left to hurt me...but maybe if you were to ATTACK first and then use the stuff?the fire portion is 5 stars..why did i give it 3? cuz its in PAL and its all about gymnastics..freaking frenchmen!!!!!!!
2,Doug Sulpy,"What's this reviewer's background? How does he get all this information? Doug Sulpy has been at it since before the Internet, publishing periodicals called The 910 and Illegal Beatles. In them, he reviewed various bootlegs, and official releases. He seems to have a preference for looking into the Get Back Sessions, when The Beatles were at their creatively lowest. While I don't have a beef with him (and various other ""staffers"") reviewing discs, I do question why does he aim for a period in the Beatles lives when they were not doing their best work? I guess it makes for better ""reading"", but I could be wrong."
3,national audubon society field guide to north american wildflowers eastern region,"Many very good photos,but too much back flipping and cross referencing to get a good field ID. Good home reference but not an easy field guide."
3,Great resoucre,"This book is up to the standards of other National Audubon Society publications. If you have a diverse selection of wildflowers or want to grow them, this is a good addition to your library."
5,Wildflower Book,We used this book for our Nature area to help with Merit Badges at Boy Scout Summer camp. Came on time and worked well.
5,National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Wildflowers: Eastern Region,"I love This Book , And This spring plan on using it aot,I live in the country and have alot of woods around me .I reccomned this book to any one , This is a book that good to have around no matter what"
2,not as good as petersons guide to wild flowers,not quite as good or easy to use as petersons guide to wildflowers. Check out petersons first. Then come here and look for this one. Even better books exist in places local to where you're looking at plants.
2,His most disappointing book to date...,"I've enjoyed most of his cookbooks so far but this is by far his weakest one to day. It's an odd hodgepodge of recipes from all over the map with not much being new or noteworthy. Some are just renamed recipes that have been around for ages. The recipe for ""Spicy Chicken Broth with Tortillas, Avocado and Lime"" is nothing more than tortilla soup with a fancy name. It's not a bad recipe but it's hardly exciting or new.Some of the new recipes are just strange or in a couple cases just plain bad. The ""Wonton of Salmon with Green Curry and Coconut"" is just bizarre and the ""Muscat Gelee with Blackberries and Rosemary is just awful. The rosemary overpowers every other flavor. There were some more oddball recipes but those were the real standouts for the ""what are they doing in this book category."" I really wonder if anyone tested all the recipes in the book."
2,"""Wow, he's gotten pretentious!""","I loved Real Kitchen, so I eagerly picked up this cookbook by Tyler Florence. After flipping through it and skimming the recipes, I thought, ""Wow, he's gotten pretentious!"" Compared to Real Kitchen, this book doesn't even feel like it's by the same person, except for the laid-back narration, the notes, and the really cool pictures. The ingredient lists have doubled or tripled and the instructions are also quite a bit more lengthy. Many more exotic ingredients and involved technique. I recommended Real Kitchen, but I wouldn't buy this book. I'm glad I only checked it out from the library. This is not the same Tyler Florence I got excited about when I read his ""real,"" ""unfussy,"" ""bold"" recipes from Real Kitchen."
5,Eat this Book: Cooking with Gobal Fresh Flavors,This is a great book. It has such a range of foods and flavors. So far I have made 8 items in the book. Everyone I would make again and again.
2,Disappointing,"This book was not at all what I'd expected. Despite the fact that it was written by Marco the comedian of the Animorphs it's the most serious one. There is not a new Animorph in this book and Marco's mother does have a Yeerk. There's not much to it,it's mostly about how Marco feels about his mother and what he decides to do about it. It is sort of important but the writer could have put more into it. Now don't get me wrong I love the Animorphs, especially 29, but this one was a disappointment."
4,A so-so book.,"I love the Animorphs series, and I've been following it for a long time. I think that some of the books are greater that others, but some have problems like this one. The plot is great, explaining what happened to Visser One after book #15, but it didn't have as much humor as in the other Marco books. I have a feeling that K.A. Applegate could be losing her touch. I think it'll all depend on the future books."
5,Outstanding Book,"I love all of the animorphs books and the reunion is the most recent one I've read. I think it's a great story with a lot of action, seriousness, and humor at the same time. It's about Marco's encounter with his mother and his struggle to free her and fight Visser One. This is definately one of the best books in the series."
5,On the edge of your seat.,"I'm an avid Animorphs fan, and I would recomend this book to all fans. It finally gives you some insight on what happended with Visser One. But like all good things it must come to an end. Once again Miss Applegate does a great job of keeping you on the edge of your seat, and leaves you wanting more."
4,"Good, but not exactly what I expected.","In my opinion I think that K.A. Applegate could be losing her touch. Out of all of the Marco books, which are mostly the books with the humor in the series, this one wasn't that funny. The story lost my interest through several parts, and the heavy drama in it was highly uncommon with Marco. It got too serious, which I'm not saying is bad but can get boring sometimes! However the plot was good, explaining what happened to Visser One after book #15 (read it to find out). I would still recommend this book, because you'll end up wondering what could happen next."
3,Not up to the hype,"I've heard Madam Netrebko live as Violetta in ""La Traviata"" and bought this CD remembering this amazing performance. Sadly this new disc doesn't live up to my expectations. Netrebko sounds monotone in each piece, her trills (Which she sang perfectly live) are shaky and unstable here plus her timbre just doesn't fit a role like Lucia. I was disappointed by her rather unmoving Amina as well. Sadly I fear that Miss Netrebko, who is a very talented singer, is already falling in the trap Miss Gheorghiu has fallen into. The world is DYING for a new diva. Both Gheorghiu and Netrebko have been called ""The new Maria Callas"". This is just nonsense. Why not let a young artist develop properly before pushing her up, stressing her to the limit with roles far to hard and dramatic? Hasn't Gallardo Domas' failure of an Aida proven that this is the road to disaster?"
4,A Refreshing New Voice in the Russian Vein,"Anna Netrebko is one of the many young singers gathering attention from the opera world. She is graced with physical beauty, acting skills, and a well-schooled voice. She sings beautifully and with intelligence. So what is missing? Perhaps it is the repertoire on this disc, or the miking, or the rush to get this recording on the market. But for all the positives there is a sameness in sound from aria to aria, beautiful as that sound is. There is also a tendency to spread the pitch on the high notes, a neglect of pianissimo, traits not unfamiliar in the Russian Opera Houses. These are not things that cannot change, and from the basic gifts of this young beauty, it would seem that they probably will. She is quite showy! Meanwhile, for an opera arias disc by a lyric soprano, this is a good one."
3,Just another soprano,"She's not a true coloratura, at least not a very good one. I have and love her ""sempre libera"" album. Her mad scene from Lucia (though she slides to the 1st top note) made me involuntarily think the word ""magnificent!"". But in this album (and on reflection, the other one too), she's just a soprano. A very good one, but she's no Tetrazzini or Mesple or Sutherland or Jo. She belongs in Verdi, not in Donizetti. On the other hand, if all you want is good straight singing (Rosa Ponselle), and don't care about the ornamentation and pyrotechnics, you will probably like this album. I was disappointed."
2,Gimme Natalie Dessay instead.,"Okay, so this is the diva-in-training that's supposed to bring glamour back to opera? Yes, she is beautiful. Shame those hands had to scrub floors; hope she makes it on the cover of Vogue someday. However, she is not the Great New Hope for opera. That voice is not suited for bel canto, or Mozart. She sounds like a new Barbara Frittoli to me. Frittoli, with a dash of Fleming. She has that taffy-pull to her voice, like Fleming, without the heavy portamento and sighing and all those other awful Fleming tricks. The basic color of the voice is interesting, rather dark-hued, but the technique is not quite there, despite the studio producers' best attempts to turbo-charge her high notes.Sorry, guys, but for romantic French and Italian bel canto reperatoire, I am sticking with Natalie Dessay!"
3,Very good but OVERPRICED,These are quite good but what fool would pay 20.00 for 12 graham crackers?????????? Find others that are just as good for less than half the price ... This is a joke!!!!!!!!!!
3,bath pillow,The bath pillow works fine once you have gotten in blown up. It was extremely difficult to inflate compared to others we have had in the past. Perhaps if you have a bicycle air pump it would be easier.
1,Bad spa pillow,I ordered two of these and neither one would hold air. I would not order them again. They were inexpensive and you get what you pay for. The company was very cooperative and sent two more pillows at no charge.
5,Loved the Pillow,My wife has a hard time finding a comfortable pillow for the tub. We finally found this pillow on Amazon.com and it was exactly what she was looking for. It was shipped quickly and we had it for her to use in two days.
4,value for money,"I found this laptop quite a bang for the buck. It's not too heavy/bulky that's why even girls like me won't have a hard time lugging it around. The widescreen is bright and clear - perfect for viewing movies. I especially like the shortcuts provided in the keyboard to start/stop the disc player. The laptop doesn't easily heat up as well.I would have rated this item as 5 stars if not for a few nitpickings:1. The Delete key is not positioned in the usual way (near the function keys at the top). Instead, it is beside the space bar. This needs some getting used to.2. The volume control is a bit tacky/old-fashioned because it is shaped liked a knob instead of a touch-button like other laptops.Overall, I find this product to be a very good value for money."
4,Great item,"I was alittle worried about getting this laptop with vista but I have not been disapointed yet. Great system that slammed my presentation out of the park. This is my 3rd Toshiba and I couldn't be happier with them. My only complaint is that it needed more than 1GB out of the box, but I run high graphics and CAD a ton."
1,hobbiest not historian speculates freely,"Repaces Eurocentrism by Sinophilia largely by study of maps (many here produced but too small to be much use). Uses highly speculative linguistic clues. Biggest problem is ignorance of Indian, Indonesian, and even Arab navigation and technology - thereby lacking perspective and claiming too much for Ming fleets. With Menzies (but less extreme) he claims Chinese rounded Africa to Atlantic. He is unaware of Ajanta caves that have boat carving in early 7th century rather like a few on maps used speculating about Chinese from which broad conclusions are drawn. A very few new points are worth consideration. Minimal notes and limited familiary with the considerable academic literature on Indian Ocean. Not recommended."
1,Awful,I read this book after I read 1421 The Year China Discovered America. 1421 Heresy is very poorly written and makes no point I could find. The author was trying to make a point by referring to maps in the book. These maps were soooo tiny nothing was legible. I could not determine if the author was for or against anything. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this book to anyone with any knowledge.
2,poorly written,I am disappointed with the writing. It rambles and is had to figure out what points the author is trying to make. I don't know if I will be able to maintain my interest in the subject enough to figure out if there is something of value here.
5,Setting the Record Straight,"This book is the perfect compliment to Gavin Menzies book 1421, The Year China Discovered America. Menzies bases his arguement on his knowledge of sailing. The author of the present book, provides corroborating data from ancient maps, documented facts such as the presence of chickens {which originated in China) in Peru when the Spanish first arrived, and words introduced from unknown sources.Conventional history turned on its ear, yet again.The sad thing is that many people have yet to read these thought provoking books on alternative history.A great read."
2,Facts Need Checking,"I have enjoyed previous issues of this book but I bought the current one expecting, as a Red Sox fan, the descriptions of the scoring of the playoff games and the play by play of the World Series. Unfortunately many innings were missing and the scores were not always accurate.The descriptions of the batting leaders for 2004 were also mistitled. It is too bad that an otherwise valuable record book was issued too hastily without checking the facts."
3,The worst of all their albums,"Compared to ALL of their other releases this album was a huge disappointment. The music and subject matter are far more mainstream. The dark and haunting guitar hooks are hardly there anymore and Covans (Sounds like Meshuggahs singer, not a death metal growl) vocals just can't match the pure nihilistic fury of Saurons. It's amazing that fans of the earlier Decapitated albums are rating this piece so high. Hopefully on the next album there is a return to their original, unique sound. I honestly can't believe that at the core this is the same band.....what the f**k!"
4,Global Geomorfology,I LIKED SO MUCH TO BUY IN THIS SITE. MY PRODUCT ARRIVED BEFORE I HOPE.I THINK THAT IT IS NOT EXPENSIVE AND THE RETUNS IS RIGHT.THANKS
1,Not worth your reading time,"I find this book to be extremely dull and lifeless. I love studying geomorphology, but this book is almost enough to turn me away. The graphs, diagrams, and charts are overwhelming. It seems to based more on statistics then observations of how systems really work. The photos are boring and uninspirational. Reading through the text is like slowly dragging my fingernails down a chalkboard. I can barely make it through 5 pages at a time without losing complete interest. The explanations of how systems and processes work makes no sense to me. I find myself having to cross refernce this text with other geology texts from different classes. Also, many of the people that are quoted are from the 1940's and '50's. Ridiculous!! It reads like a computer assembly manual in Japanese. Granted, the text does cover a wide range of geomorphological features, it does not cover them well."
3,Sentimental nostalgia,"Be aware that this is not a book on classic Romanticism. It has adequate instructions for painting sentimental gardens, cute fuzzy bunnies, and old fashion grist mills. It would be a good introduction to simple landscape art for a beginning decorative student, but falls short of offering assistance to the intermediate or advanced artist."
4,Painting landscapes,This is a very nice book with great patterns and very easy to follow instructions. Several friends have borrowed this book from me.
5,Beginning painter,It taught a lot about techniques. I have bought several books from Amazon on painting and this one was really great!!
4,A help in times of trouble,"Fran Caffey Sandin has done a wonderful job of putting together very important short pieces to address the things that plague Christians and non-Christians alike, and each different piece gives hope in the Lord for each different difficult scenario.After reading I sent the book on to a young man who is a family friend. His brother just committed suicide and this will help him to know that others have had to deal with the same issues he is with regards to his loss.Way to go Fran et al!"
4,Performance Review,"The Office is one of the best comedies to be produced in the last number of years. Season 4, although it does not reach the bar set by series 2 and 3, has much to recommend it. 'The Dinner Party' episode is undoubtedly The Office at its hilarious cringeworthy best, and although the other episodes in the series don't all hit this height, they still produce enough laughs, enough moments, to make the series a pleasure to view."
3,"Good, not great","Remember that there are fewer episodes in this season and in order to make up for lost time to the writers strike, they included more hour long episodes. I think The Office is a better show when the episodes are limited to 30 min. Also the Deleted Scenes aren't as funny as other seasons. There are still great moments though, like the raid on the Utica branch... Classic"
2,Dissapointment,"I am disappointed with season 4 - it started like fun but truthful comedy in seasons 1-3 but it shifted to soap-opera in season 4. Mike changes from weird but nice guy to an idiot, Dwite becomes hysterical type and (the worst) love stories kill all the fun and now completely dominate the plot."
1,Mac support,I bought all 3 seasons via itunes and enjoyed them on my ipod and apple tv. NBC / Jeff Zuckerman - who I used to respect from his days at the helm of the today show have actually ruined my return to episodic tv. I haven't really watched a show since Seinfeld. Good move Jeff!
1,Great Show! HORRIBLE Price! Don't buy yet! Here's why....,I love the Office. It is a great show but do not buy this season at this price. It is ridiculous to pay this much for HALF of a season basically. You aren't getting your money's worth and if NBC sees big profits from this it will encourage them to get away with it in the future. Wait until it goes down in price and then purchase. Don't do it for me do it for yourself so you save money down the road.
2,Unsatisfied customer,"Wow, disc 1 is horrible. It skipped so many times and then eventually stopped playing. Disc 3 skips a lot too. I am disappointed with this DVD set and unfortunately I'm stuck with it b/c I'm overseas and it's hard trying to return it."
1,High $$,"I agree with the others who gave this a single star. This is not a full season and so it should be priced as such. I bought the first season for around $20 it didn't have a lot of episodes that season, so I felt the price was fair. To pay more than $20 for season 4 is way to much in my opinion."
2,Making up for lost Profit,"I think that NBC, or whoever sells these dvds, is trying to make up for lost profits (fancy word for money) that were suffered during the writers' strike"
4,Imported to the UK,"I am from the UK where only seasons 1,2 and 3 have been shown/been released on DVD. Therefore you can imagine my joy when I found out that my DVD player was multi region and therefore could play The Office Season 4. This season is by no means the best season, however it is still hilarious. It is well worth a buy if you, like me were dying to know what happened after the end of the season 3 climax.Also, I have to add that in my opinion, American DVDs seem to be of a better standard than their European counterparts. Both in packaging, content and freebies.All in all, an amazing product that I would recommend to anyone State side or European."
4,It's the Office!,"Good season. I was a fan of the hour-long episodes because a lot of the latest season's episodes seem too short. Not a lot of episodes... probably because of the hour-longs and the writers strike.I just wish there were more commentaries and special features. This DVD set seems to have even less than seasons 2 and 3.Cause, I mean, without the commentaries and special features I might at well record the season myself and not bother buying the DVDs."
4,Best Comedy EVER!,"Best comedy on television by far! This season is a little short because of the strike, but I got a pretty good deal on Amazon."
4,i hate this show but girlfriend loves it...,"i can't stand this show, making me unpopular everywhere i go... my girlfriend took this home to watch it immediately and couldn't resist recounting some of the breathlessly funny and ironically twisted humor that i am apparently depriving myself of... she loves it"
1,Over 200 minutes shorter than season 3 for the same price.,"Season 4 was great; though not as funny as other seasons. I guess everything goes down hill after a while. Anyway, I have bought the past 3 seasons the first day they were available on DVD. I will not be buying this one for a while. I would buy it for 19.99-24.99 but nothing over that. It is not even a full season even with the episodes that are around 40 minutes. According to the Walmart web site it is only 2/3 as long as season 3. Ridiculous Season 4 = 320 min. while season 3 = over 560 min. I'll just buy it used later on."
2,Great season but...,"I love the Office more than most shows on tv today however, why does NBC feel the need to charge so much for a season that was half as long because of the writer'strike? I understand that there are probably tons of extras but this is an insane price. They need to read these reviews and realize many other fans feel the same way and cut the price down a bit."
5,Why It Costs So Much,"This was a great season, and I see a lot of complaints about this kind of price for such a short season. There's a reason: MANY of these episodes were a FULL HOUR, as opposed to other seasons where almost all episodes were a half hour. Compare the full running time of this set to seasons 2 and 3 and you'll see it costs less, even though it's only a bit shorter in overall length."
4,Short on extras,"One of the reasons I buy dvd sets of television shows is for the ""extras"". I've come to expect a lot from ""The Office"" dvd sets. There are usually a number of excellent commentaries (they usually provide interesting insights and are entertaining); however, season four has only four commentaries. I was particularly hoping for insights into ""Dinner Party"" and ""Goodbye Toby"". Normally, I'd think of deleted scenes as a great extra, but I've been spoiled by watching many of them online already. Aside from that there are few additions. I had hoped the reduced episode count of the season would be offset by increased background information. That said, it still does a better job than many other series."
4,Double length episodes make this equal to a 19 episode season.,"There are 5 double-length episodes here that increase the episode count from 14 to 19. And at 19, that is just 3 episodes short fo a current full season.What does puzzle me is the varying lengths of the half hour episodes, some are as short as 20 minutes & 30 seconds; others clock in at 21 minutes & 40 seconds. Are some cut?If you get the 5-disc version some retailers are selling for the same price, then it is worth picking up! Disc 5 has a Q & A session from the Scranton ""The Office"" convention."
2,Barely ok,"I love this show and have watched seasons 1-3 repeatedly. But this season... what happened? Are they out of ideas? Are there new writers? What used to be witty and genius has turned obvious and slapstick. Also, it was depressing and tried to be artsy. Please! It's the Office. I liked it better before. Season 2 was the best so far. Season 4 was crap. I can't believe I got it the day it came out. I hope season 5 is better, and the Office actually takes place in the Office, with the characters rebalanced and not caracatures of themselves."
5,Excelente serie,"Es una excelente serie, la cuarta temporada es un exito tanto en la calidad de la comedia, como la calidad de actores, muchas risas y un gran desestresante para verlo despues del trabajo, recomendado 100%"
5,Office 4 Review,"Even though the season was cut short by the writers' strike, the season is still filled with laughter, surprises, and great one-liners. There are also several minutes of deleted scenes from several episodes which are worth watching."
5,Great season!,"I loved this season. I've been getting them one by one over the last year. This season is as good as the others. The best of them all? No. But a great season none the less.If you are collecting these sets, I don't have to tell you how great the office series is. So I shouldn't have to recommend this season either. You're gonna buy it no matter what anyone says. :)I was happy with the purchase and the shopping experence related to this transaction. No complaints here."
4,Goodbye Toby parts 1 & 2,It was good but some of it got a little too sexy for me. Other than that it was very good.
1,You gotta be joking,I love every episode of this show but having to pay full price for a shortened season is a joke. When they wise up and lower the price to a reasonable number i'll buy it but not till then.
2,Awesome show -- hope season 4 comes to Mac soon.,"This is also my favorite show.I would just like to echo some of the other posters, and vote for the support of the Mac too.iTunes, supports windows users by the way.I think if this show can't be directly on iTunes Music Store, it could certainly be downloadable in a mac friendly format -- while preserving the publisher's copyrights. Or why can't amazon software developers create a software for Mac users to view them?Amazon is usually very leading edge store -- and my favorite place to shop bar none. I really hope they make their video downloads available for Mac soon.Just wanted to get my voice heard."
2,GO BACK TO iTUNES...,"brilliant show and my favorite on tv, season 4 is terrific as well. BUT, NBC needs to go back to iTunes; its had to have lost money; wanting to charge so much for an episode 4.99? its not fair when NBC leaves iTunes for this idiotic service. its not even compatible with mac, or I would purchase it. instead, i may do like many others and illegally download it. thanks but no thanks."
1,Bend Over,"$32 for 14 episodes? That, plus the fact that this wasn't their best season means it's something of a ripoff. Based on what a ""full"" season set costs, Season Four should be closer to $22. I'll not buy it until I see it in the discount rack."
5,Awesome service and quality,"Amazon Unbox rocks!! Do not listen to a bunch of mad mac fans. Mac sucks and that is why nothing supports it. The Unbox service is easy to use, easy to download, and you get your episodes a day after they air! I am very happy with it. If a mac user is waiting for it to go to iTunes, forget it! Mac messed up again and thought their service was going to be the only one on the block. Now I can buy .mp3 songs (unprotected) and video files with being stuck with crapmac software. By the way if you buy a song on itunes it is in .mp4 format and can ONLY be used with crapmac software. So who is Propriety? Unbox 5 stars itunes 0 stars period!"
5,Laugh it Up,"The last episode of this season alone makes the disc worth the money. Beyond that, the classic 'Dinner Party' episode is the shining light of this season. There are some great character arcs for Kevin, Toby, and Dwight, and the subplots with Ryan run throughout the season, culminating in a terrific surprise. Of course, Steve Carell's portrayal of Michael Scott holds front and center in this season, and his glue holds everything together like mayo holds tuna salad."
5,Good Job Amazon!,"The Office got here before I would even have a chance to get it from a store. Plus, it was cheaper and it had free shipping! Very happy!"
3,These episodes are edited,"I recently bought season 4 for $9.99 which is a pretty good deal. But tonight I caught ""Launch Party"" on WTBS and saw that there was more content on the broadcast than was included here on Amazon. Specifically, after Michael locks the pizza delivery kid in the conference room, there is a scene where Kevin and Oscar are researching the penalties for kidnapping on the internet. On the TBS broadcast, kevin had a few lines about kidnapping being the physical ""asportation"" of a person. These lines were not included on the Amazon version. Obviously this makes me wonder what else is missing on these episodes.Overall, I love The Office; Season 4 is hilarious, Amazon's on demand video and Unbox work very well on my computer running Windows Vista with a DSL connection; and I was happy with the price I paid. But I can't give 5 stars if I'm not getting all the content."
2,A Season Too Many,"They should have stopped after three.Season four is where the show's humorous moments are outweighed by the ""this is just too stupid"" moments.In one episode, for example, Michael Scott is driving a car with Dwight. The GPS system in the car says ""right turn"" and, with Dwight protesting that they should only bear right, Michael turns right and drives into a lake.You know the show is losing it when Michael Scott is portrayed as even more demented than Dwight.Season four is still laugh-out-loud funny at times, but usually not enough to make it worth your time. The only reason to watch season four is as a soap opera: There are some interesting things going on in the characters lives, if you care enough about them."
5,hilarious,The seasons keep getting better and better. The writer's strike didn't effect the season as much as I thought it would. It's worth the money to purchase this season even though there is only 16 episodes. I highly recommend going out and buying it.
3,"Great For Returning Fans, Not So Much For New Viewers","For fans of NBC's The Office, Season 4 was a sigh of relief and a squeal of joy, particularly for those rooting for Jim and Pam. From the perspective of a new viewer, however, these episodes may not inspire one to keep watching, as they do not measure up to those of seasons past. I have to cut it a little slack since the season was shortened due to the Writer's Strike, but it's unfortunate that Season 4 was a tad rushed and it lacked a lot of focus on the supporting cast. Still, I will admit that even episodes I hated when they first aired grew on me when I had the opportunity to rewatch them (Survivor Man, for example). In addition, the deleted scenes and extra features on the DVD are wonderful, especially the blooper reel, and were great to tide me over until the start of Season 5. The script insert is a fun read as well."
1,disappointed,My dvd case came crushed because it was shipped in a simply padded envelope. A piece of the case broke off and scratched one of the discs inside. When I wrote to the seller she promised to credit my account for half the cost and I was to let her know after we watched it if the disc was not viewable. She never credited my account. Also when looking back we purchased another dvd set from the same seller and had a similar problem. We will not purchase from them again ever.
1,Why can't I get this overseas?,"The Office is one of my all time favorites. I have to give the Unabox, download version one star, because I can't download it. I work for the army overseas. I used to be able to get my favorite show from iTunes and other download services, but now I can't for some reason. Why is this. I have one question for Amazon and NBC. Why do you hate the troops?"
5,"Oh, yes! New Middle-grade Mystery Series!","Linda Joy Singleton, who has written more than 25 books loved by her young adult fans, has a wonderful ability to tap into the emotions of her readers, both through her own vivid imagination and contacts with readers through school visits and the internet.OH NO! UFO! begins the adventures of the Strange family, whose members are as quirky as their name suggests...except for teen Cassie, who longs for a ""normal"" family. When a camping vacation results in an alien taking her sister's place, Cassie risks more than she expects in a hilarious and surprising effort to save her sister from becoming a prize display on alien TV.Singleton's zany new series is sure to win middle-grade reader loyalty as strong as that given to her suspenseful and award-winning YA series, The Seer."
4,An Excellent Resource by a Noted Expert,"Ann Wallace is nationally recognized as an expert on fabrics and textiles of the American Arts and Crafts Movement. She has developed her knowledge both through academic and practical experience.This book reflects her experience and knowledge. It is a ""must have"" book for anyone interested in the history of the Craftsman Movement in the U.S., and especially for anyone who is acquiring or collecting textiles from the period, or contemporary work done in the Craftsman Style."
2,Disappointed,Did not contain what I was actually looking for. Photos of Arts and Crafts designs on textiles were lacking. Too bad.
4,A Real Bargain,"If you are looking for a small, inexpensive guide to the Arts and Crafts movement, this book is a good choice. I particularly appreciated the English background information and photographs."
2,not all its cracked up to be...,"this game isn't that great. it gets boring really fast. its sort of like tetris, but the reverse, you have to build a tower instead of getting rid of blocks...its more fun with more than one person, because you get to throw bombs at them, and in custom mode you have to build up and throw bombs, but it still gets old too fast. there should be more to it, more options and stuff."
4,"Turbo Bell Adjustable Weight Dumbbell with Stand, TB560","After your last repetition, don't drop these on the mat like you would with a regular solid dumbbell. It could cause the spacer inside the dumbbell to break which prevents the weights from being released from the unit, which happened to mine.I called Performance Fitness Systems (1-888-999-9490) and talked to Rick. He was very helpful. I had to do some troubleshooting to the unit because Rick and I did not want to send the unit back as a whole, because it's heavy. So, after opening up the unit, I discovered that one of the larger spacers broke which causes one of the larger weights to not to be able to get released from the dumbbell. Rick had 3 new spacers sent to me. Since the incident, I am more careful to try not to drop it down hard after the last rep. and the they worked great since. I've been using it for about a month and a half now."
1,20lb weight falls off,The 20lb weight on one of the dumbbells fell off 3 times in one set of 20 reps. The plastic locking mechanism is not very well thought out or perhaps this one is just defective. I will contact the manufacturer and update on their customer service.
3,so far so good,"had these for over six months now. they are a bit bulky and have plastic locking mechinism. i don't trust these and will replace them when in a few years. so far they do great job, and has a great grip. i'm giving it a 3 star because of the plastic locks which will wear down eventually. which also leads me to believe that it is over priced."
4,Fun - But Not The First One,"Girls in wonderful shoes, racing around New York City in search of clues and answers to save their lives. Basically the same as the previous novel, except some different characters and of course a different style of shoe. I found the novel to be entertaining, but lacking in comparison to the first. The first one had all of the exciting and intrigue of a new novel. Since this is so similar, well it has fallen short.The story is about Jennifer, who was the roommate in the first book. And how she gets sucked into the PSW game along with the hunky FBI agent from book one. I can't tell you who is behind it or who ""done"" it or the outcome, but the novel is a fast and fun read."
4,A little different from the first one.,"I quite enjoyed this one. Like the first one, an easy read. I finished it in two nights. Unlike the first one, instead of using math and logic, the clues were Broadway Plays, which I found interesting. Enjoyable little book, although the characters were a bit too predictible."
3,Fast read.,"I read 'The Givenchy Code' and really enjoyed it.For some reason this book just didn't hold my interest as well as the first one. I like the main character better in the first than in the second. I guess I could relater to her as a person more.Either way, this is still a great book ans a fun read.I'm looking forward to reading the third (and last) book in the series."
4,Springtime in Funen,"I know the music of Carl Nielsen since 1974, when I heard it on a Danish warship. I fell in love with it at once. Knowing the island Funen, where in the city of Odense also Cristian Andersen was born, I was delighted by the music written on his homeland. Springtime in Funen is Cristian Anderson's proza (ferrytales) in music. Listening to it brings you in the wonderland of Christian Anderson on Funen. It's just adorable.I have it on record (with Suit from Aladin):Pefformers Inga Nielsen Kim von Binzer Jorgen Klint The university choir lille muko St. Klemens school childrens choir Odense Synphony Orchestra, conductor Tamas Veto Unicorn Records Ltd DKP 9054"
5,So far so good,"Got it just today. Could not test the device because it is still charging. It did not recognize my 4GB Micro SD card at first. I had to install Rockbox from an opensource software site. now it is working fine with my 8GB Micro SD. I am not sure of the battery life. will keep you posted.Update 1st September: I left the fully charged device for 5 days. then i played it for 10 hours at full volume and gave up testing. i didn't expect such a long play time. now, back to charge. happy happy till now.i don't know why the link to rockbox has been removed by amazon. if u can't find it by google, let me know."
3,not everyting it claimed to be,"Good MP3 player. However, this player was supposed to have a built in FM tuner. There is no FM tuner. Also, the contrast on the menu screen is poor. It is difficult to see the menu option you are choosing."
3,Very ok device,"It's ok but nothing great. It simply is an mp3 player that plays music and nothing more. Had some obvious issues transferring music and the ""FM"" radio was non-existent."
4,Good...for the price,"I bought this a few days ago and it's my FIRST mp3 player lolWell after charging it for an hour, it acted a little weird, but it ended up working, but the battery was still low.Then I charged it again until it said it was 100% full, but when I unplugged it it was only about 80%.I said oh well. I started it up and it was missing the radio. I had to do a firmware update to get the radio, but at least it works now.Here's my review:Pros: Nice screenFM radioPicture viewer (pretty useless, but it's there)Voice RecorderExpandable memoryEasy to sync music to playerEtc.Cons: Battery life is weak!One earbud is longer than the other. Feels awkwardCan't use the player while it's charging! Really annoys meUser manual is extremely vague.No radio until you upgrade firmware.I can't think of much else now..But for $19.99 plus free shipping, I'm not complaining!"
4,Good Buy,Good buy for the price...it did NOT have a lanyard or FM stations....after contacting TheFactoryDepot they informed me that they've tried to get Amazon to correct the information about the lanyard(not included) without success. Also the FM stations is just a matter of updating the firmware(American update)...good service from TheFactoryDepot.
4,NO frills 1GB music player,"I purchased the Sansa c240 from another site on a closeout sale for around $40. I was looking for a replacement for a crappy, 5 year old 512MB Gateway MP3 player I had been using. My main criteria were:1) Cheap2) At least 1GB3) Rechargeable battery#3 was really huge for me as my old MP3 player ate AAA batteries like crazy.For my needs this player was perfect. If you're looking for a solid MP3 player and nothing more this device fits the bill. You can use it to display photos but the screen is so low res I would not recommend it. I use it when I mow the lawn and when I work out at the gym. I've read other reviews complaining about short battery life. I don't know if they just got a bad unit or what but mine seems great although I only use it about an hour at a time."
2,don't over charge the battery,"the interface is easy to use (compare to iRiver). sound quality is okay. the only problem is the battery. battery will be overcharged. i let it charge on the PC USB (similar to charing cell phone) and went to a meeting. when i came back, i smelled a wire burned. i unplugged the mp3 from the PC but did not try it right away. later that day, i played the mp3. the mp3 ran about 2 mins and then went totally dead/broken. the only good part is that it was the first day i received the mp3. so, i returned it."
3,hilarious,"I bought this for its bargain FM radio and for voice recording. Both work well for my purposes. Unlike digital voice recorders, the Sansa saves a simple non-proprietary MP3.Mac users should know it's easy to sync -- plug it in and it shows up as a separate volume. Just copy files either way like with any volume. No AAC play, though.But I gotta tell ya. I own two iPods, the 5-gig original (sill going strong) and a 1-gig Shuffle (perfect l'il thing). The Sansa makes me laugh every time I use it. The interface is clunky. Buttons feel chintzy. The software and low-contrast screen make your choices unreadable outdoors, and only at certain angles indoors.You'd think a Sansa designer would actually use it before releasing it."
2,Not as user friendly as anticipated,"I bought this for my 11 year old daughter because I had read several reviews stating that it was great for a person just beginning to use a mp3 player. I have an ipod and this is harder to use than the ipod, my daughter is constantly asking me questions if you can believe that. I thought she was supposed to know more about these things than I was. The screen sticks all the time causing us to have to pop the battery out so we can even get it to shut off. Downloading music is a snap but if its not a cd you already own the music sights you have to use charge monthly fees on top of the songs. Its ok but well not ok she doesn't hate it just finds it to be bothersome at times."
3,Bare essentials,"Recieved the the SanDisj SDMX7 but have a mixed review about the product.Pros:Size, good sound quality, decent storage capcity, SD exmpansion capability, compact and rugged.Cons:Display - not a crisp and clean looking display interface,navigation: non intutive interface, tiny buttons that makes navigation complicated.Overall: Decent product for folks interested in music and do not care much about aesthetics and looks."
5,Works for me!,"Small, cheaply priced, great features, great performance!I use it for when I go to the gym or go for a run, does what I need!Who seriously needs 20GB music players anyhow? hahaJust download the 200 songs you want for the foreseeable future and you're good to go. It connects/loads from the computer super fast!Definately get a different pair of headphones if you plan on using this with any physical activity."
3,Got my money's worth,"This is my first MP3 player and it is everything I expected. I have just two complaints. One, it's not very easy to use. While the small size is wonderful, other than the on/off/menu and select button, the ""buttons"" were made for people with extremely small fingers. Two, the user's manual is almost worthless. I pretty much hacked the device to figure out how to use it. I never could get the Media Converter software that came with the device to work as it was supposed to. If the CD didn't have the almost-worthless user's manual on it, it would be totally useless. I half expected the online user's manual to be a little more expansive than what was on the CD. It wasn't. One thing I really wanted to know was how long a charge was good for and whether there was another way to charge it than by plugging it into a USB port. I still don't know. I bought a 2GB microSD/Transflash to go with it. It works fine."
4,ipod hater,"Considering I do not like ipods, this sansa is awesome. Only thing I do not like is that when you are charging it (uses USB), you can not listen to it. Battery life is amazing. I love the size and color screen and ease of syncing with pc's."
3,Sandisk RMA support,"Sandisk support is aweful. The volume button broke after 2 months. They asked me to send in pictures. Took forever to get an answer. Called the RMA support several times. I got it was closed twice 4 hours before the stated time it was suppose to close. Then when I did reach someone she didn't have the password to access the email. Then they ""determined"" that it had physical damage and wouldn't honor the warranty even though there is not so much as a scratch on it. I will never purchase Sandisk again."
4,Awesome First-time MP3,"This was my first MP3, and I thought it was great. It is very portable, and easy to use. It was also a great price combined with the value. My only complaint is that the instructions that came with it were pretty vague, but it wasn't anything I couldn't figure out on my own. The headphones that came with it were also very good. Headphones seem to be an area of complaint with most MP3 palyers."
4,"Very Good, for the capacity....","Very Good. Eventhouh, these days you can find something with more capacity and probably at a reasonable price"
1,sucks!!!!!!,"I buy this mp3 player,refurbished item.MP3 player is come but cables and headphones is not.How do you mean that I charging and put the music on them??????Realy sucks!!!!This is not right from you.Thank you."
4,"Nice player, great price",Got this for my son's 14th birthday. Very happy once I got one that worked (had to return the 1st one but very easy policy). The player is easy to use with WMP or just drag and drop. Would have liked to be able to recharge battery without plugging into computer but is working fine and has good battery life. The expansion slot is a plus - can really get alot of music on there. Price was great and free shipping is fabulous.Overall a wonderful value.
2,"Complex interface, hard to read screen","Too much in too little.This thing looks promising, but in reality, I only use it for the radio. The mic/recording is interesting, but for emergency only since it is hard to use. The photos are only for emergency since it it too hard to use.The menus are hard to see, and the battery life is short.Overall, it is handy, but so far removed from a iPod nano that this SanDisk seems more like a museum piece then a modern piece of technology."
2,horrible,"this product is a horrible, cheap, worthless mp3 player. i installed the software, and it crashed my computer, so i had to take in my computer to fix it, and its not even been a week since i received the mp3 player and its already frozen. if you take out the battery when its frozen, it does nothing. i think its completely crashed. horrible, cheap, temporary mp3 player."
1,Not a good buy,"I had trouble with this from the start: had trouble loading songs, computer wouldn't recognize it, etc. Then did a driver update and it worked fairly well...for about a month. It started locking up during playback and the only way to unlock it was to remove the battery. Pretty soon it locked up from just turning it on. Can't say I'd recommend this one."
1,Poor Design of Charging Plug,"I bought this for my 11 year old son and within 3 days it was broken. The charger and download plug port is poorly designed. Instead of the plug interfacing with a stiff card with contacts, the plug needs to slip over free-standing pins the thickness of a human hair. If you are off by a 10th of a millimeter, you will bend a pin. If you bend a pin you can't download or charge. Without the ability to charge, the unit is worthless. The design and screen are nice, but it makes a pretty light paper weight after you bend a pin. Stay away from this unit, until SanDisk redesigns the faulty plug."
4,Sansa C240,"I love this player! It's my first MP3. My only disappointment there is not enough storage space! Supposedly if there was a V2 on the back, it could take a 4gb MicroSD, to my disappointment this was not so for my mp3. So, after buying two 4gb MicroSD cards, I now have to order a 2gb MicroSD. Luckily, I found someone to buy the two 4gbs. I wish I would have bought a larger gb MP3 player."
2,Turns off constantly,"This thing turns off constantly. I'll press the volume and the thing will turn off, I'll move the headphone jack and it will turn off, I tap it lightly it turns off. The sound is fine but quality is horrible. Buy a Sansa e200 series instead."
2,a bit disappointed,"Had high hopes for this unit-All was fine till playback. Extreme variation in volume between songs-clarity not as good as my Coby 2 gig, which has much less variation in volume and a much cleaner sound."
3,Sansa C240 V1,"This product has a problem with XP Home SP3 Operating System that is being worked on by Sandisk engineers. The bottom line is that it fails to remain on / stay ""connected"" or be recognized by XP Home SP3.Other than that, so far so good but what an inconvenience."
2,Didn't deliver..,"Didn't download audio books from desktop similar to another Sandisk model that we had previously owned, therefore returned the item."
5,Everything I expected,"This little mp3 player is fantastic. First i'd like to answer some of the other reviewers ""cons"". The interface couldnt be simpler or easier to use. Some people complained of lack of good instructions for loading mp3's onto the device but it really is easy. First, dont use windows media player, use Winamp. Winamp makes it rediculously simple. you litterally right click the files, or albums you want and go to ""Send To: Sansa c240"". and voila! you're done! as for the only have 953 megs, I'm not going to go into detail on Window's file system but its called NTFS, previous versions of windows and most mp3 players use FAT32. In FAT32 format, 1 gig is 1 gig, but under NTFS, that same space translates to a little less. that's all. you stil have a gig, it just LOOKS like less on window's file system."
4,Mostly pleased,Bought this player for its size (sports) and its Napster compatibility. Updated the firmware after having a rocky start; but things seem a little more stable now. Also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods (around 0 degrees Celsius) - odd behaviour - but mostly OK now that we are in the Spring teens again. Haven't found a case yet to protect from sweat. Interface is what I expected - dead simple. No complaints for the price.
4,this thing RULES,"This thing is so cool my friend came over to my house yesterday and he has a nano he wanted mine! It has a radio in fact lising to the vols go tennesee sound on this thing is good screen is scratch-pronePROS:sound,memory[im only 10],microsd card slot,CONS:screen,earbuds,UPDATE:Get a video ipod screen protecter cut out the size of the screen place it on the voila"
1,Zero Stars,"Seriously, should you purchase the SanDisk Sansa c240 1GB mp3 player, you may be very disappointed. My player performed properly for only a few months before imploding. Contacting SanDisk for assistance proved futile. You're wasting your money."
2,Volume Control button broke after 4 months,"I purchased this for my 11-year old daughter because I wasn't sure if she was responsible for a more expensive player like an ipod. The system worked great until the volume control button stopped working after 4 months. It is extremely loose and doesn't connect or push the internal buttons. You can see that the music is playing; however, there is no sound. Another reviewer complained of the same problem.If we had not had this problem with the volume control button, I would think that this was a great deal for the money."
3,Good value but lacks intuitive functionality,I liked the price and quality however it has a few quirks. First if you have a file called my_song.mp3 it gives it a random numerical name on the song list so there is no way for you to find it from a list. Second it is not easy to use it like a flash drive to drag and drop music. It works ok on one of my computers but not on another one. I recall reading this is one of it's issues. BUt for the price I am not complaining..
1,Poor design and construction,"The headphone jack started cutting out after a few months. One channel is now completely dead. The screen is easily cracked (my fault, but nevertheless....) and the battery cover is loose and feels like it will fall off. I would not purchase this or the larger capacity (2GB I think) built with the same design. Junk - worthless now."
3,Good deal but not handy.,Over all it's good value for the money. The only things I don't like are the charging via USB and the fact that you have to be connected to delete tracks. Next time I'll probably look for something more user friendly.
2,A prelude to so much more.,"I was determined to read something, anything besides Asimov, so I grabbed this one as the cover looked interesting. The beginning drug on and on. Finally about the 3rd chapter I became involved in the story, and it was very difficult to put down. The overuse of names is very difficult to follow, several different Edwards, Johns and Henrys.This story follows two powerful men, Edward and John. Their friendship and their downfall. The story is historical fiction taking place after the death of Henry VIII. The stories can get very violent and painful, but a reflection of the times. This book will lead me to know more about this era and peoples."
2,Good but Bad,"This is a good series but FUNimations did a horrible job on it. I saw both the English and the Japanese, and the dub is bad, some characters even lose their personality from the original japanese version. So like most of the funimation dubs they ruined it."
4,Beautiful Little Story,"I'd never seen this, previewed a couple of episodes via Youtube and thought it looked good. I liked it, the animation was pretty good although if i sat too close to my monitor sometimes it looked sloppy but the style was pleasant. I was surprised that it was so short so that's disappointing. The voice acting is good, the story plot is interesting and I really liked that it was reflecting on just what true freedom is in a technologically deceptive society. Complexity in society sometimes clouds and hides basic moral truths, it's easy to forget what's really important in life and this anime does a great job and making that distinction within any possible given societal construct.I took off one star for the shortness of the series."
4,Looking Glass Buckle,Great artwork. Only negative for me was that the height of the buckle was just a little to much.
4,good quick read,"This would be a great series for a lower level reader. Its a good step up from Magic Treehouse books, but lower than something like Eragon. They are AR tests, so that is good for students whose schools use that program. I am going to recommend the series to 4/5 grade librarian."
5,A great storyteller,Each time I finish an adventure in this series I cannot wait to read the next one. Gregor is a strong character surrounded by many exciting characters.
4,Another exciting adventure,"As usual the author had to give some background information for any reader who hasn't read the previous two books, but the adventure begins right away. This time Gregor's mother gets in on the adventure but it didn't turn out to be quite what she thought it would be.The adventure introduces some new characters and has plenty of action but also points out the lengths some will go to when they value their race above all others.A very fun read."
4,Gregor and Boots back at it again,"With Gregor and Boots back at it in #3, their mom gets sick by a flea, will she survive? Will they find the cure? With the journey beginning, whom will Gregor be bringing? Read this book and you will find out the secrets within, but surely read number one and two before you try this adventure."
2,Kindle Epic Fail-Book is great,"My daughter loves these books and so on a trip we tried 4 times to download it to her kindle fire, though Amazon charged us it would not downLoad.Good book, but recommend buying it hardcover from a local seller."
5,Underland Chronicles #3,It is so hard to put these books down. YOu fall in love with Gregor and Boots and just want to find out what is going on in their lives. Collins is so good at making you feel their feelings and visualizing what they are going through
3,"A warning to parents---extremely gruesome, may not be age-appropriate for your child!","Apparently no longer content just to gratuitously kill off multiple major characters as she did in the first couple of books, Collins has escalated to full-scale biological warfare---and of course, the humans are the bad guys. And these books are for ages 9 to 12?"
5,Best of the Underland Chronicles,"This book is the best of the Underland Chronicles. The problem/quest is compelling and is clearly laid out from the beginning, the prophecy is cryptic enough that I as a reader didn't really get it until the characters did, and the new characters are fantastic.Hamnet, the kind yet conflicted outcast, brought a whole new depth to the series. His guilt over past wrongs and love for fellow creatures makes the Underland's conflicts and Regalia's role in them all the more heart-wrenching. His history also opens up a new understanding of the royal family, in particular the gulf between Vikus and Solovet."
3,So-so,"For the third time, Gregor and his little sister Boots descend to the Underland to fulfill an ancient prophecy. In this story the Curse of the Warm-bloods is a terrible plague that threatens every mammal in the Underland. On their journey to find cure, the heroes encounter Luxa, her bat Aurora and Hamnet, Luxa`s long-lost uncle. Although I enjoyed it, the story jumps around far too often and also fails to answer questions from previous books. As one and two were okay but not great and this one is only so-so I don't think I'll read any others."
4,Great book for any age.,The third book in a series that is interesting for any age. I read all of them. They are such an easy read - probably because they are written for younger people. But I enjoyed the plot and twists with the secret message.
5,Great story!,Another great read in the series! A must-read once you begin the Gregor campaign! Suzanne Collins is a fantastic author for my all-male 5th grade class!
3,Adult reader who enjoys 'Youth Books'.,"Middle of the road, average, easy read with good story line.May appeal to a younger audience than the 'Hunger Games' series."
4,Okay book (not plot givers),"This book is a great sequel to its others. The main plot is okay, and the action scenes feel a little less exciting, same battles with the same enemy, and of course, Gregor and Luxa are tied up in a young teen romantic situation. Not very good if you haven't read the prequels."
5,Essential Reading,"How often can you read a book that can synthesize practically everything you know, cross reference subject matter, and at the same time inform you about the world and societies as you know them in a way that is informative to people possessing a high level of aesthetics and knowlege of history, art, and literature. There are few books like this for us, but this is one. Essential to expanding your point of view."
3,Loosen up by pouring on paint,"Here's what I like about ""Pour it On""1. Some creative techniques are given, with complete instructions, like fabric dye, spraying, foam stamping and cornstarch patterns.2. There's a good section on framing and how to choose the right frame.3. There's a section on negative spaces (the areas where the drawing ""isn't"") that helps in composition.4. There's quite a bit of demonstrations sets of photos from start to finish.What didn't I like? I found most of the paintings uninspiring. I didn't like the color palettes used, either. That's a matter of personal tastes; your feelings may well be different.In summary, if you haven't tried some of the more creative watercolor techniques before, this is a great guide. If you are looking for inspiration USING these techniques, I prefer some other similar books by different authors."
5,GREAT MUSIC!GREAT CD!,"This cd is really awesome!Anybody who is on this page looking obviously knows it too so get the word around about Aesop Rock, this guy is dope.Buy this, its a must must must have."
3,Aesop King Of Rock,"""Daylight,"" Labor Days' initial standout, works from a long, plush melodic loop with a wood flute sighing over it Ace's message is that life can be hard but that's all the more reason to shut your mouth and work on something that makes you happy. Essentially. That last line's from ""Save Yourself,"" (from Labor days) which collects Ace's comments on the How We Do Hip-Hop question-- he's undie, of course, here with his sonically progressive Def Jux releases, so clearly he's going to drop some invective on this Important Issue. His take, though? Forget it: ""Maybe you ought to try saving something other than hip-hop,"" insightful advice no matter what genre you insert at the end. ""Pistons pump perfect,"" he says, then, ""what you're holding ain't really broken."" And for the duration of Labor Days and Daylight EP, it's pretty clear that in the hands of someone with something to use it for, it's not, not at all."
4,Aesop Fables ?,"Well okay I like the cd but when it comes to listening to it all the time,. No ! Number one is my favorite for the beat they have in the back."
2,Trashy Fun,"Don't kid yourself this one is dreadful! But there is something funny about watching a couple of woman running around with a bomb looking for the perfect place to throw it to escape being blown up, while they deliver the most outrageous (stupid) lines which are suppose to be witty. This is one of my favorate, So bad it's funny films."
1,Headache Inducing - For Masochists Only,"From the brash dialog to the annoying characters to the nonsensical narrative to the lackluster editing --- this has got to be one of the most grating films Jess Franco has ever done (and that's saying a lot!). The same characters were in Franco's ""Kiss Me Monster"", but it's a tossed coin to decide which movie is worse. This one is also known as ""Sadisterotica"" and is really a chore to sit through."
2,Nice bag... too small,"I bought this bag based off the reviews, which the reviews are correct; the sleeve is very nice and offers a nice soft padded protection, however the 15"" sleeve does not fit my 15"" Retina Mac Book Pro (mid 2012). I could barely get the computer into the sleeve... I guess you could make it fit by stretching the sleeve, but it would be extremely cumbersome to ever use on a daily use."
4,This thing works!,"I am the type of guy who has gone through life treating most of my things as if they were baseball bats, fine tool that take/give a beating. Somehow the Mac book seemed less durable and more shiny so I looked for something like...STM MacBook Glove...sleek, soft, black. Cool, absorbing the beating for the laptop to keep it nice and shiny. And best of all the price was right."
5,Old Haciendas - New Views: BRAVO!,"This is a fantastic book -- a must-read for anyone interested in Mexican architecture, design, or an overview of current trends in innovative and adaptive reuse of classic haciendas. Beautifully illustrated and well written, THE NEW HACIENDA is recommended for anyone with a passion for Mexico."
5,Absolutely beautiful!,"Karen Witynski and Joe Carr have done the impossible and have created, a beautiful follow-up to Mexican Country Style. The inviting cover pulls you into each chapter and the spectactular photography demands you turn every page slowly and take in the narrative as it describes hacienda lifestyles. You will return to this book again and again."
1,To much use of other people's photos and information,"This book has lots of beautiful pictures but hardly enough of true haciendas. It is lacking originality and exterior/interior photos of the haciendas themselves. Text content is ""ok"" but repetitive and sounds like that from other books. Very overpriced for what it presents. The authors mention that they are building their own ""new"" hacienda. If they have such a true love for the old ones why didn't they rescue one from ruin??? Very commercial in my opinion."
3,Get it personalized!,Do an Amazon search for ABC Blocks Personalized Teddy Bear Security Blanket (pink)$28.95. It is the same item but personalized with baby name and date. I have bought this and the blue boy one for every friend & family having a baby. They always give feed back that it's their baby's favorite! ;)
2,Predictable,"This is one of the books in mini-series. From the beginning I was able to figure out what was going to happen. Jeremy is lame. And so are the Wakefields. The parents never really do anything about Jessica. They only ground her, which is the same as doing nothing. If you haven't read this mini-series and is planning on it, I won't spoil it for you. Just know that as usual Elizabeth is right and the bad guy will be stupid enough to let her catch them. Don't everyone wish they were as perfect as the Wakefield twins? They also end up on top, regardless of who they hurt. I will continue to read these books because I do like their friends but not them so much. I'm glad this book is fiction because this stuff could never happen in real life."
3,It was an alright book.,"All of the Sweet Valley High books i love i have read most them because they are the best books ever; however in this miniseries, I find it hard to read because it is so predicable.... It needs to be a little more suspensful than it is.. I suggest if you get it to save for a day when you are quite bored."
2,not very easy to understand,i didn't like this book. it was extremely complex in my opinion.... i've never found a book so hard to read in my life. not impressed.
4,Exploring your mind,This book will interest readers who wish to learn more about Cayce. Chapter-by-chapter it explores Cayce's ideas about different kinds of psychic powers and how to develop them. It also cautions readers about the dangers involved when exploring their psychic selves.
3,Not bad,"Well I cannot compare this to any other psychic book, so I will only give you my opinion.If you can get anything helpful out of a book, I think it is worth it. I honeslty was expecting some excersizes that would help me develop a better understanding of what happens to me from time to time. This was more of a book to help you understand the benefits and possible psychic awakenings from meditation and dreams.I found it very interesting and helpful in those ways.Overall this was a good first read."
3,Difficult to follow,Some of the suggestions are difficult to follow. It requires a lot of concentration.
2,"Not an ""Edgar Cayce Guide""","This is a good intro into the psychic world, but why is it called an Edgar Cayce Guide? There really isn't that much on Edgar Cayce's technique's, advice, or view on things. Definitely a misnomer. There's a lot of content on other examples of psychic testing and abilities from other sources, but it's almost a ploy putting Cayce in there because he's kind of just mentioned among these other sources. Almost all of the book is spent giving evidence on proving that psychic ability is possible and very little practical techniques until close to the very end.If you want to read about Edgar Cayce and his advice on psychic abilities, read a different book. You'll be dissapointed if you buy this thinking that it's actually an Edgar Cayce guide."
3,Great Pictures,"The Tour de France is, to me, the most compelling sporting event ever, so I really enjoyed the historical photographs, as well as the account of the origin of the Yellow Jersey. There are lots of charming anecdotes, and a rough overview of the careers of some of the big names. The bit on Lance Armstrong is too brief and seems to hold him and his accomplishments at arm's length, but then it was written by a Frenchman.All in all, the text is less than stellar, but the photographs are really wonderful, so I'm glad I bought it, though I'd look elsewhere for a thorough history."
2,Something (a lot) lost in translation,"Trying to make sense of the text - translated from the French - is the main enjoyment of this book (if, that is, you consider deciphering tortured syntax enjoyable). The book struck me as a 'rush to publish' to capitalize on Lance Armstrong and the TDF.While there are some nice photos of past Tours, I think my money would have been better invested elsewhere."
4,Maillot Jaune,Some really great vintage photos in this book. Text is good but similar to o lot of other TDF books. Depends what you are looking for or how familiar you are with the history of the race. I like the book for the images mostly.
3,So much for the price.,"Since I am a beginner I occasionally use this. But, I keep thinking of purchasing eyepieces of higher grades in the future. Optical qualites are fairly limited. The extreme small ones are too dark to use. It might be better to purchase 15mm and Barlow(sp?) lens seperately."
3,Not a bad set,The 32mm and 9mm Plossls are great. The Barlow is adequite and the rest should be replaced later! Good strong case and the moon filters work wonderfully!Perfect price point for what you get.Would recommend this set for the beginner looking to expand his EP collection for as little $ as you can.
4,fantastic for the price,this is the best deal on the web i have found for the money and investment. Thanks for the great deal.
1,No single return,"I purchased this and found a bad 9mm lens. Neither the seller nor Celestron would replace the lens unless I returned the entire set. If one could pass inspection without being found, I figured I better not chance another set with more or a different lens being bad.I just decided to eat the cost of the lens.You'd think a company that makes lens' would have some type of inspection process to see if there were any problems but apparently not.There's really no alternative to buying this, each lens and filter would cost well over $500 if purchased separately, so take your chances."
3,I like the case.,"OK but I have a good eyepiece and a barlow lens already. I like the case, but haven't used the filters much yet."
3,Quality of merchandise,"I ordered the Celestron Accessory Kit w/five lens, Bartlow 2x lens, and assorted filters. The kit comes in a metal case w/foam lining. The metal cover, on the case, has a bubble in it. Located on the bottom of the case. This doesn't interfere with the performance of the product but it is a nuisance and a disappointment. It makes one wonder if this is a common practice, to move slightly defective material to internet customers, or maybe this is the agreement with Amazon.com and its suppliers. However, the contents seem to be in satisfactory condition."
4,A good starter kit.,"This kit offers a nice, and inexpensive, selection of eyepieces so that you can figure out which ones work the best with your telescope and viewing habits. Once you have that figured out then you should buy some some quality eyepieces that suit your needs as, other than having eye cups, I really don't think these are of any better quality than the ones that came with my Celestron scope. The filters don't work well on my 4.5 inch scope, as they darken things down a bit too much, but if your scope has more light gathering ability I am sure they would work fine. The case is well constricted and has plenty of room to cut holes in the foam for add ons. Overall, I would say that this is a beginners essential need as a learning tool if nothing else."
5,Accessory Kit Review,"I just received my Nexstar 6 SE and these lenses work very well with it. I was a little concerned when the handle on the case broke the second time I picked it up; the lenses survived (fortunately the foam inserts inside are great). My friends have some lenses that provide a slightly better view for a significantly higher price, but I'm very happy with these. These lenses could easily, and very clearly, resolve the Cassini Division... for a new astronomer I think that's pretty good.A great deal for $109."
2,You get what you pay for I guess,"I'm fairly new to astronomy, but I expected better quality when I purchased this eyepiece kit from Celestron. After reading some of the reviews here, I was convinced that these were going to be some decent eyepieces and filters. This kit may be alright for some, but I found them lacking in quality of fit and build and would not recommend them to anyone who has the desire to use the high-power eyepieces (9x, 6x, 4x, etc). I bought these because of the low price tag, and for the most part, I regret not just buying one or two better quality eyepieces from Televue. The filters were really ""cheap"" too."
5,Great Kit!,"I bought this kit the same day I purchased my first telescope. The eyepiece options I have now ensure that I always have the best view. The quality is good, and the color filters really bring out features on Jupiter and Saturn. The moon filter works good as well. The one thing I use the least is probably the Barlow. The case is well made and holds the two eyepieces that came with my scope (10mm and 25mm). This is a great kit and a great value, do yourself a favor and get it."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I ordered this knowing full well that Celestron lenses weren't the greatest in the world, but this was still a little disappointing. When using these lenses in my telescope, all of the images were quite blurry, no matter which lens I used. The filters were less than impressive as well. My yellow filter arrived with a very noticeable scratch through the middle that makes it nearly worthless for using with the telescope. Also, the foam insert for my case does not match the one in the description and did not include space to store my own lenses and that was one of the factors for me that lead to my decision to buy this. Buyer beware, this looks like a great deal up front, but the quality of these lenses and filters is quite sub par."
4,Good Buy,"I am happy with the purchase, this kit is awesome. All the various lens elements are good and filters are useful, only there was no extra hole cut in the sponge as shown in the pictures."
2,Poor Quality Control,Several lenses have specks of debris on the inside of the eyepiece. I don't feel comfortable disassembling the eyepiece to clean then however.
4,accessory kit,"Bought this for my Celestron Se8..the guy at Celestron told me over the phone I wouldnt be happywith this kit after the first few uses and to go with a larger plossl set. I was tight on moneyand low on knowledge and am paying for it now. I cant use the 4 & 6 eyepiece as they are too muchpower for my scope, but not a bad package for a beginner with a smaller scope"
4,Nice value,This kit came with a good assortment of eyepieces. I wish they would have included a zoom one but they can be purchased separately. The only filter I've tried is the moon one which is virtually necessary if you plan on viewing it much since it is so bright it hurts your eyes after a while. I bought this kit for use with a telescope that costs a lot less than the kit because eventually I will upgrade to a better scope and be able to use the kit with that. It does improve the images from the scope a great deal and the case is very useful.
5,Great deal and great quality.,"Before seeing this kit, I bought separately a 6mm Plossl and a 2X Barlow. Those two items are part of this kit, but they cost me more separately than the entire kit! Tried it out last night and was very pleased. The two original eyepieces that came with the scope plus the 5 included in the kit and the Barlow give me 14 different possible views of the sky, and the color filters should help pick up planetary details."
2,Not much substance here,"A ""pleasant"" read, but very shallow. It started at a nice pace but felt rushed middle to end....and the ""mystery"" was easy to figure out at about the halfway point."
3,Rather choppy,"I did enjoy this book, but found the writing rather choppy and disconnected. The ploy line was good and the mystery okay - just not well written."
1,Something to be desired here.,"Lighthearted, a comedy murder-mystery, too self-conscious for my taste. Always liked Collins but will now reconsider other works by him."
3,Nice Weekend for a Murder (A Mallory Mystery),"Very interesting storyline as I've taken part in Host of Murders, but lightweight reading is my only criticism. Didn't have me reading till all hours."
4,"st. johnswort has the same properties as prozac, and is safe","st, johnswort has been around for a very long time. but is has been used in europe more frequesntly than in th us .however it should be used with caution and the prescribed use should be by a homepathic doctor. other than that it's the safe alternative to prozac with much less if not no side effects."
2,Not the machine for me!,"This machine does work and it does make a good cup of espresso, but I was disappointed in the overall quality of the construction and operation. The steaming arm does not lift (!), so you have to tilt the milk cup...fine going in, but coming out, you have to move the machine to the edge of the counter to keep from spilling the steamed milk. I returned this machine and bought a Saeco Via Venezia for a few dollars less. I like the design much better, and the steaming arm angle is adjustable!"
5,great stuff,Saeco 30013 Aroma Traditional Espresso Machine: Works great! I have no complaints about any part of the machine or workings.
1,pretty but non functional,"The machine worked flawlesly for the first 3 weeks. Since then, the staemer works for about 10 seconds then stops. It can someties be restarted by waiting then trying again. If you fill the strainer to the top with coffee, then it just dribbles out wth no crema."
1,Do not purchase any Saeco products,"I purchased a Saeco Aroma, unfortunately it was damaged (cut water feed line) and broken valve so I called customer service and they said they would e-mail me the return shipping information but I got nothing. I called again and they said they would send me the info but I got nothing. I have e-mailed customer service in the USA and corporate headquarter over a hundred times and they do not even bother to return my e-mail.This company will take your money then if something goes wrong ignore you so beware of buying anything from Saeco."
2,Possibly a great buy...,"I loved my first two latte's that this machine produced after I primed it. Unfortunately, day two, it completely stopped functioning. I had to return it and just wasn't willing to risk an exchange... even if this was perhaps just a fluke. While it did work, the espresso was as good as it gets from a non-commercial machine."
5,play that gospel song vol 1,"I have never written a review for anything before-but this is the best instrumental gospel cd I have ever heard. I bought this for my Dad-nowI have to buy him another one-I've listened to this several times a day for weeks. If you like classic gospel and acoustic guitar etc. you willreally like this-my favorite is ""Whispering Hope""."
2,Bulky & bad reception,"I have this phone for about 4 months, and I experienced many dropped calls, and the phone was need to be replaced because the software need to be updated. Then I got a used phone, and the screen is not working properly, and need to go back to the store again and ask for an replacement.Pro:big keypad.good camera.con:bad receptionbulkyand not funtion"
4,A superb disk,"Neeme Järvi, an Estonian who received most of his musical education in Russia, has produced a rich, impassioned, utterly idiomatic performance of Scriabin's Third Symphony, with all the Wagnerian/Style Moderne over-the-top ecstasy one might wish, plus a polish of execution and a loveliness of orchestral palette that outdo most Russian orchestras. A really definitive disk.The Arensky miniatures are quite entertaining and disarmingly tossed off. Excellent recorded sound."
5,Find your own buddy coach,"Amanda Rankin's Buddy Coaching has brought the secrets of the corporate world to many who will never see the inside of a boardroom. I highly recoment Buddy Coaching to high schoolers through empty nesters. Everyone will benefit from thissimple, practical approach. It is an easy system that all can use to bring them to greater growth. It is a wonderful companion to my book, The Mentor Quest: Practical Ways to Find the Guidance You Need. These two books will help you become all that you can be."
2,Capitalizing on fumes,"I only give it 2 stars because I liked one of the songs on this ""documentary."" It has almost no storyline, no attempt at showing the viewer anything other than random cars bouncing up and down. No history, no interesting facts, no nothing. Save your money and buy Sunday Driver instead, a real documentary and not just a guy watching car shows repeatedly telling you who he is through the entire dvd. The other 3 entries in the L.A. Street Life series are a hundred times better."
4,Los orígenes míticos de la Historia,"El primer volumen de la trilogía de Manfredi es una larga y fantásticamente morosa introducción a lo que vendrá; a la epopeya de Alejandro. El autor elabora su historia sabiamente, precisando lo verosímil para afirmar lo insólito. El pasado ignorado de Alejandro, ese territorio fantasmal previo a la ""modernidad"" helenística, es la materia esquiva del libro y Manfredi derrocha sin tapujos su fascinación por el macedonio. ""...la complejidad de la historia es tal que hasta podría ser verdadera"", dice en alguna parte de la obra Calístenes discutiendo con Aristóteles. ""El Hijo del Sueño"" ensaya una hipótesis y el arte del escritor consiste en hacernos creer que bien puede haber sido cierta. Hacia el final, el avance de Alejandro hacia un destino trazado por los dioses hace tan insostenible la tensión que uno no tiene más remedio que descorrer las páginas del siguiente volumen."
2,Overrated and Badly Written,"Whilst Alexander story is certainly impressive, this book is certainly far below my expectations. It lacks style, good dialogues, an intelligent subplot (his life was interesting enough not to make the novel a bore) a good description of the other protagonists. One thing is certain: a good (and expensive) marketing campaign (such as the ones that Stephen King has) can sell a lot of books, and make its author famous, but will not transform him into a good one"
1,A Forgettable Book,"Possibly one of the worst manuals/text books that I have come accross in my years of academic studying (and working on bikes). The author seems confused. This book comes accross as a jumble of ""cut and paste"" and this aspiring textbook writer would have been better off just telling what he knows about carbies. I regret that I can only warn you against this mumbo jumbo."
5,Excellent Quality for Price,"These are an excellent deterrent against theft. They will make a thief think twice but won't stop the persistent criminal. I you really want something to lock your wheels, then why not get a lock (U Lock recommended)? If you are confused about the tightening torque then get a torque wrench. I didn't have any issues. I would also recommend putting some thread locker on the threads."
1,Do Not Buy! Not reliable,"These are not made well, the threads on the nuts always strip out. The first time you install is no problem but when you have a flat tire and have to remove and replace the wheel that's where your screwed. Like the previous reviewer, the torque is to low and even hand tightening is too much. It's to bad, I really like the simple design."
2,silly design flaw,"The ostensible purpose of these is ""security"", that is, the need to have an allen wrench to unscrew the skewer. Sure enough, the skewer rod itself has an Allen head, and indeed requires an allen wrench; however, in their infinite wisdom, the Axeldrodz creators cut convenient wrench flats into the *other* side, the nut the skewer rod screws into; thus anyone with an adjustable wrench or even pliers can open the skewer without bothering with the allen side. The nut should have been totally smooth dome, denying any purchase; what moved them to cut wrench flats into it is beyond me. The skewer will function ok as a regular skewer, but if you want security, either get something like Zefal, or at least replace the nut with smooth one scavenged from an older skewer - many of them have smooth-domed nuts."
2,vague and slowpaced,"I really wanted to like this, being a fan of the musical version [Songs From the Gypsy] by Boiled in Lead, but I have to admit that I'm not impressed. The sections concentrating on Stepovich the cop are fairly compelling, but the sections about the various Gypsy brothers and especially the Fair Lady [who's the villainess] are so vaguely described as to not engender any interest. Plus the subplot involving the seduction of Stepovich's daughter by the Fair Lady seems forced, like it was shoehorned in at the last minute to give Step a personal stake in the story. Overall I found that large parts of this novel just dragged interminably. I didn't feel like hurling it against the wall when I finished it, but I didn't feel like my time had been well spent either."
2,"not just boring, but worse ... not funny","I really like everything I've read by Brust. Up until now that is. Where did the dark humor go? Is the Gypsy supposed to be the hero or ""Step"" or ... doesn't matter, I found them all unimpressive characters. I like to read authors I know and like, and when they go nuts writing something completely uncharacteristic it's like picking up a random book in hopes It'll amuse me when I wanted a sure thing. I consider my time wasted in the reading of this novel."
5,love begins,I love the Love Comes Softly series. Was disapointed when the last one came out. Was over joyed when the announced that this came out. Glad the came out with family movies again. We need more good movies like this.
5,The Saga Begins,"Love Begins is just that a beginning point for the saga of Clark and his first wife, Ellen. My opinion was that it wasn't as interesting as the others released, but nevertheless I look forward to the next episode."
5,Review of Love Begins Prequel,My wife has enjoyed each of thefilms in this series. I purchased this DVD as one of a several surprise Christmas presents for her. It is well done and seem to integrate well within the overall series.
5,part of the Love Come Softly Series,"I thought it was a good movie, But I have watched the Series and so that is why I enjoyed it."
3,Love begins,This was a christmas gift for my grandaughter. Sheenjoyed it very much. It makes an easy gift for meand it was free shipping.
4,Nice romantic beginning,This was a nice beginning to the series although it was filmed after the series was out. I enjoyed it and fell in love with Wes Brown.
4,An old west romance,Good movie. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it hadn't been for the one curse word. Why do they have to do that? This movie of course would appeal more to girls than guys.
3,I didn't think it enhanced the Pioneer series,"I love the Pioneer series by Janet Oke, have read the books each winter for about 30 year running. I bought the series of DVD's but then someone thought they could improve things and added two prequels which I don't think added anything to the story and is pretty off-track. Just my opinion"
5,Love Begins,"absolutely loved this movie. definitely a chick flick but good message behind it. I have all the other movies as well and love those too. this review was done by amy, steve's wife"
5,Awesome Series,Love Comes Softly is an Awesome series... Touches your heart and you realize how much God is working in your life...
5,Great movie,This is a great movie with a great message.A definite must watch just like the rest of the series..
1,A Desecration of a Great Movie and a Fantastic Book,"If you like Hard Core Logo(thebook or the movie) don't buy this. It's garbage. The artist is a good artist, but is a poor graphic novelist. The images don't flow or mesh with the text. It's choppy and everything that made the book and the movie so special (the relationships between the characters, the subplots about John, etc) have been utterly destroyed.The art is pretty, but everything else is quite badly done."
2,A+ Design/Prodcution but the Story?,"Graphic novel based on the screenplay for a a feature movie about some punk band in Canada. The design and production is lovely, but the actual story didn't do anything for me."
4,"full of color, personality","The arduous tasking of recording these concerti was amply done by Gutierrez. The second is a landmark recording because it is impeccably done. All the tempi in the 2nd are taken briskly. But the reading is never facile always colorful. I love the way Gutierrez builds into the final parts of the cadenza in the first movement. Even the 2nd movement is interesting because Gutierrez plays it colorfully. The 3rd movement has a grotesque flavor, while the fourth ends *brilliantly*.The 3rd concerto is not done on that same stratospheric level as the 2nd because it is simply not as interesting."
4,Helpful Guide For The Rio Visitor,"How marvelous of Lonely Planet to devote an entire book to one city -- and what a city. Rio is one of the most beautiful, sexy and scary places on Earth and this guide is a great help in many different ways. It does lack, however, in the area of music -- which is an essential part of the Rio experience. For that I would recommend ""The Brazilian Sound,"" in order to better enjoy the clubs, samba schools, Carnaval parades and dancetarias of Rio."
4,Even good on stage,"I actually use this dude for strings on stage, plugged into my EMU Proteus 2000 - it's really dependable"
2,don't count on them updating th driver,"I own a previous version of this keyboard, and it worked OK though the pitch-bend wheel stopped working after a year. BUT this company is one that feels it's OK not to provide updated drivers for new operating systems to force you to waste a perfectly good piece of equipment and buy a new one. Greedy and ecologically wasteful companies should be voted against with our wallets."
4,NICE ALBUM,"I have to say that this album, although is very good and some songs are very catchy, it's not so strong as her previous album ""Escucha"". The best songs in my opinion are ""Estrella gemela"", ""Mi canto libre"" y ""Corazón fragil"" and the closing track ""Por el camino"". Still it's a worthy album, and it deserves to be heard, but I think that ""Escucha"" is slightly better and more consistent."
5,BREATHTAKING CD!,"I don't know where to begin, there's so many good things to say about this CD, I'll resume all saying that Laura's voice is impeccable as always, the sound of the instruments are so well equalized that you can feel you are right in the middle of the band, hearing this CD I wished there was 5.1 surround sound cds, because the experience would be unforgetable, If you heard Laura's music before you are used to the best of the best, this CD is no exception, and let's be honest you can't expect less from Laura.I didn't like the songs ""Estrella Gemella"" y ""No me lo puedo explicar"" sung by Eros and Tiziano respectively, but after listening to them from Laura, I realized what they meant.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO LOVES TO HEAR HIGH QUALITY MUSIC."
4,conan the conqueror,I was 9yrs old when i read this book and it stayed in my mind when ibecame a Docter and recieved my 1st pay ibought all conan books icould find andstill am looking for fantacy books to add to my collaction 1980 to 2004. fantacy nut yes (yes)klang
4,BEST TRIPOD,"This is the worlds best tripod for point and shoot cameras. This device helps out for so many things: when using self timers to decrease shake, when using self times for long open shutter periods, videography, self-portrait arm extender, when using self timer with extra reach to get over crowds. This tripod is very thin, low-profile, strong, light-weight. It will hold a DSLR (but not without support). Definitely well worth the price."
5,Essential Reading if we want to make Society Safer,"I'm still recovering from my 5-year marriage to a man with ASP that ended in 1982. When I left him, I'd never heard of ASP or sociopathy and I thought I was losing my mind. Reading ""The Mask of Sanity"" was the best tool available to help me. ""Bad Boys, Bad Men"" was the book I wish had been available back then. This book isn't ""pop"" psychology. It is an engaging discussion of a long-term study of ASP by a respected researcher and professor of psychiatry. The financial and emotional costs of antisocial behavior are incalculable. But I hear commentators on TV and radio every day who simply don't know what they are talking about. I am so grateful to now have the facts at my fingertips."
4,A good resource book!,"After many paper and journal searches in the library on Antisocial Personality Disorder, I was attempting to put it all together..... then I discovered this Book! From the family member to the Mental Health Professional this book gives the reader a look into what is and who has Antisocial Personality Disorder. A very easy read into a very complex disorder!"
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately not the book it should have been. More of the same tired material rehashed from other books. There is little of real use in this book for a diehard A65 fan and someone who knows these bikes in detail. Maybe the book is not for that person, but then who would buy it? The A65s do not have the charm of the Bonnies and there must be a very limited market. There are some nice pictures. Not enough in colour and some a little fuzzy. There are some rebuild stories, but none provide new insight and tips. Such as, how do you make it easy to remove the footrests on a OIF A65? Or removing the head of an OIF A65, or removing and installing the plain bearing.I am keeping mine, but only beuase I can't be bother to send it back and I like to have everything on A65s."
2,Not good!,"This product's cover was in terrible condition, and not really worth the money I paid for it."
1,$$$$$$$$ for fuel,"Good heat, but had to pay $43+ tax for 5 gallons of K1 fuel at Home Depot. Do the math... very expensive to run at these fuel prices. Plus I never got 12 hours out of a tank.. yeah I know, they advertise ""up to 12 hours"" per tank..."
5,Imaginative and engaging,"The story of three sheltered children who decide to leave the confines of their gated home and explore Zimbabwe 200 years in the future is a tale that will appeal to both adults and children alike. The pleasure of reading this engrossing story was compounded by the imaginative characters the author introduces to propel the narrative.Author Nancy Farmer resided in Africa for 17 years and has used her extensive knowledge of culture and folkways to infuse this novel with a tone of authenticity.The title of this appealing story refers to the three genetically altered individuals who use their mutated talents of hearing, seeing and limb elasticity to solve crimes. The fact that these somewhat clumsy detectives are usually always ""a dollar short and a minuet late"" add to the charm of this engaging science fiction/fantasy tale."
1,"The Ear,The Eye, and The Arm","When Tendai,Kuda, and Rita are kidnapped the Matsikas hire the most unusual detectives in the world. The Mellower thought of the idea and he regreted it. But, why? The children are tossed around constantly in this book. Will they track down the children? Who is after the children and why? This science fiction book will catch your attention, if you like science fiction."
1,The book wasnt that great.,"I see people giving The Ear the Eye and the Arm 5 stars. Well maybe your just doing it so it dosent look like a waste that you bought it, even though you know it was. The book is terrible. Little kids do not even enjoy it. Nancy Farmer needs to work on her skills."
4,The African Future,"This is an exciting piece of literature that takes place in 2196. If you enjoy a good detective story, here's your book. There is a big confusion on which is an antagoniust and a protagonist. If you like to read long detective stories that make you think, I recomend this book. Tendai has a strek of his father in him, I believe. Rita has a bunchof her mother since she becomes, well I'll let you read it."
3,It was alright,"I think that this book was okay, but it wasn't my favorite, although I likethe use of all of the technology. The story is about three kids whojourney into the underbelly of the Dead Man's Vlei, which is pretty much anunsanitary dump. I'd recommend this book if you are interested in Africanculture, but if you're not, please stay away from it!"
4,The Ear THe Eye The Arm reveiw,I think this is a good book for people who like action and the future. The main plot of the book is find kiddnapped kids. This book is set in the future year 2194! This one of my favorite books. I recomend this book to everybody!
4,"The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm","The book had an attraction like no other. The way the author would explain every scene in detail was as if you were standing right there and that you were a part of that one scene. Some books that you read are just flat out boring and you just don't want to finish it, but this book is not like the rest of the books. You can sit there for hours reading the book and even for one second want to put it down. So if I were you reading this advertisement right now I would got to the book store or even to the library and check out this book and start flipping through those pages."
4,Provocative Book,"This was the first Nancy Farmer book I ever read. I'm not a science fiction fan, so I must admit that I found parts of this book very strange. But at no time did I lose the story line and at no time did I lose interest in the characters. What I liked most about this book was that the author set the story in the future and constructed a plot that is provocative -- it makes the reader think, and what it makes the reader think about specifically is the abyss between the rich and the poor, an abyss that grows ""abyssier"" every day. I liked this book well enough that I've since read other Nancy Farmer books."
4,Great Adventure,"This is a wonderful children's story, woven with myths and legends from Africa. It is a tale of a secret walled garden, three special children, a man-child, a holy innocent who helps to guide them, and three detectives Ear, Arm and Eye who help to track the children down.It is the story of becoming, and of belonging, and of finding your place and purpose in the world. Incredibly well-written, it will keep most non-readers glued to the pages.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"
5,read this book!,"It paints a vivid picture of future Africa- most people think of Africa only as tribes, huts, and lions. I know I did before I read this. Ancient spirits play an active role in this futuristic and exciting novel,and the plot twists and turns as detectives trace the kidnapped Tendai, Rita, and Kuda through all the different faces of the city. The children, kept secluded for most of their lives, must find recources in the city and in themselves that keep them one step ahead of the game. The blend of past and future is different and exciting, the characters are realistic and memorable, and the plot keeps you on your toes. A great book for all lovers of mysteries, sci-fi, or fantasy."
2,Boring.,"As an avid book reader of all genre's, and a person that can read most books in a day - maybe two if it's some stereotypical thick fantasy book or three if the author is Margaret George - this book took so long to read because frankly, it couldn't hold my interest. The storyline is not set up, so you feel confused off the bat. What's going on? Who are these people? It's slow moving and not as futuristic as everyone makes it seem to be. Then there are the names and titles. If a 300 page book has 6 pages of Glossary and Appendix, it makes for a lot of time flipping back and forth to figure out who is who and what the heck they are trying to say.There is no truly BAD book. I'd say that all books that I haven't enjoyed have an awesome premise, just a bad delivery. Such was the case with The Ear, The Eye and The Arm."
3,Read by a 12 year old,the cover of the book made me think that it was going to be about a robot being made from human parts. i got lost in the middle of the book because the characters were switching so fast. i thought the ending of the book was obvious. i wouldnt have read this book if it wasnt for my school and summer reading.
3,The Ear the eye and the Arm,"General Matzicas children get kidnapped for a unusual adventure where they meet the she elephant who is forcing them to work for but they alwas manage to scape they get on a bus which takes them to resthevans the trash mens house but the bad thing about resthaven is that once you go in you cant go out, but they still escape then they get on a subway and go to the mellower's mother's house and she holds them for ransom,but after they escape from there they meet with the she elephant and the she elephant plans to sell them to a gang but just befor they get sold the ear the eye and the arm detectives show up and they get saved."
2,"The Ear, The Eye and the Arm",Don't look behind a mask! This book takes place in 2194. There are three kids of the Genral of Zimbabway. The will not let the kids out the the heavly armed house. Because he afraid that a gang called the msks will caputre the childern. He also thinks that the gang will turn the childern aginst him.This becomes true when the childern get so bord that they have the mellower talk the fahter into giving leaving passes. Then a cuple hours later the kids get captured and they are put to work in a plastic mine. Then the kids are sold to the masks!! Will the kids ever het home safly?
1,horrible.,"i had to read this book for school and let me tell you it was the worst book i've ever read (and i've read a lot). it's about 3 spoiled kids that want everything and when they're not allowed to go on a stupid scout trip they escape and get kidnapped and all that junk. a fat lady called the ""She Elephant"" (what kind of name is that?) makes them mine for plastic. ummm hell-oooooo who wants to read about that? and this book got a reward for God's sake. + it's supposed to be the year 2194. are you kidding me? they need a phone so they're like ""where's the phone, there's gotta be a phone around here."" i meaqn c'mon people...we're in the year 2005 and we have cell phones...i'd think that in 2194 we'd have cell phones too. I'm tellin ya Nancy you don't know how to write about the future.-a dissapointed reader"
4,"The Ear, Eye, and the Arm","This world has only one gang. The dreaded Masks. But crime is still a problem. Would you choose to go out there or would you stay behind a heavily guarded wall like the characters in this book are. Tendai and his sister Rita and his brother Kuda are the children of the powerful General Mastika. Their life is like a prison with luxuries. The children want an adventure but to get out of the houseis impossible. It is like a prison and a palace both. Tendai and his siblings have never seen the outside world but yearn to. If they go out they will have to face the dangers and obstacles that come with it. When they are kidnapped, the children are going to finally have a real adventure! Tendai has to find a way to escape but he is not prepared. With an inexperienced brother and sister will they escape or will they be slaves forever?"
4,"Place-Harare, Zimbabwe Time-2194","...place- Harare, Zimbabwetime-2194It was the troubled time of the Masks, the only gang General Matsika had not yet wiped out.But little did he know that greater trouble was to come when his children vanished and ended up in some of the worst parts of the city, som even unknown.But when they do, he has no choice but to call in three of the strangest people in Harare. One has the power to see anything, one has the gift to hear anything(with his enormous and expandable ears) and one is not only psychic but also elastic!So he puts what little faith he has left in the three freaks who call themselves detectives, yet he is stunned when they are hot on his kid's trail. But things get very dangerous when some politicians turn out to be part of the Masks. Can the detectives save the lives of the Matsika children and their own on top of a mile-high building? Find out..."
5,anonymus reviewer,"She has woven into this book a story with unmatchable characters villains and creatures. It starts out in a boot camp like household in which a military-like father forces his kids to take his path and go into the army. A kind person called the mellower happens to hypnotize there parents into handing over there I.D's and credit cards excess money e.t.c. And the children escape into a future (2194)Zimbabwe city. Soon after they get kidnapped and turned over to an evil old queen who turns them into slaves. The mother of the kidnapped children after hearing her children escaped, called 3 detectives called the ear the eye and the arm. They all have been gifted supernatural powers in which to slueth with. Will they find the children and rescue them or be turned into slaves themselves? You'll have to buy the book and read on to find out."
3,THE EAR THE EYE AND THE ARM,The Ear The Eye The Arm is about three kids who trick their parents into letting them go on a field trip by them selves as soon as they go out side they run into trpuble and get kidnapped by the she elaphant and turned into slaves.when the parents find out their childern have been kid nap they hire three detectives to find them.The Ear the Eye and the Arm.While the children are trying to get home the detecives are getting closer and closer to finding the children.I would recomend this book if you are looking for a long good sci-fi book.If not i wouldent recomend it.
5,I loved this book!,"I first started this book when my son told me about it. He was reading it in school and had read ahead to see the ending. He told me it was great. I picked up the book and read. Suddenely, I couldn't put it down. How it has to do with acient and modern Africa. I just simply enjoyed it. I read it to my other son and he quickly grabbed it and read it. I think the characters are the best part. From General Matsika to Mrs. Horepool-Worthingham, it is great. It reminds me of my trip to Africa but way different some how. I recommend this book to sci-fi readers and kids of the world. Happy reading!"
5,A 2194 odyssey,"Even though Tendai, Rita, and Kuda are the kids of a multimillionaire, they are literally trapped within the walls of their 2194 home. Their father kept them at home due to his many enemies still around the streets. But then the children decide to run away from home, which leads to talking Blue monkeys, trashpeople, and mutants chasing them around. This is a futuristic odyssey you don't want to miss."
5,A Real Good Book,The Eye the Ear and the Arm was an enthralling book about three children who are kidnaped and held for ransom.The book takes place in Futeristic Zimbabwe. The children are the sons and daughters of a famous General who has cut down on crime in the city and is hated by all terrorists groups(there were many terrorist groups until the father put an end to them). After they are kidnaped the mother of the children hired a group of odd dectivies to track down the children. The agency is called The Eye the Ear and the Arm. The hunt for the missing children take the dectives all over the town from the plastic mines to the biggest building in the world where the story ends. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure or mystery stories.
4,"The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm","Imagine a safe beautiful house that has everything inside, would you like to live there? What if you lived there and cannot exit. Would you still want to be there?The General's children who live in that big house run away and were not found. They just hang around in the city, kidnapers take them from here then sell them to thieves there, when they escape from one they get caught by others. The parents hired the best, but strangest ditectives in Africa. General Matsika never caught The Mask's, who are the biggest gang in Zimbabwe, like all the other criminals. They don't want anything from th town, just to kill and steal, it's just how they live. It is up to the detectives to find the children. The spirits of the unknown, and the sophisticated technologhy. Thieves and kidnapers can so stuff beyond your imagenation. Will General Matsika's children come back home safely and unharmed?"
3,The Ear the Eye and the Arm Reveiew,"The Ear the Eye and the Arm might not seem like avery interesting book. You'll probably think that the book title is boring so the book will be boring. Well at least that's what I thought. In the beginning of the book it might seem a little boring but the way his father treats his kids is unbelievable. All through the book it gets boring then exciting, boring then exciting. At the end of the book when the last and only gang left in Zimbabwe called the Masks catches the children it isn't too exciting since you'd think that the Masks would do something worse than what they did. My las comment about the book is that personally I think that the book was okay, it wasn't the best. If you don't have a clue to what I'm trying to say read the book!"
3,The Ear the Eye and the Arm,"A book that shows the future but at the same time the past and what happens when they mix. When the generals children get lost they encounter a world that they had never experienced before. With the most gifted detectives after them you never know what will happen next. When the kids enter a city with all sorts of people walking around you never know whether there is good or evil, and ofcourse, both can be encountered."
5,The Book of the Future!,"In the year of 2194, cars fly, robots work for you, and holographic phones are used for long distant speech. Three children set out on an adventure that leads them to incredible heights. From the desolate wasteland of Deadman's Vlei to the extraordinary structure of the Mile High building they face friendly characters and the vilest of them all...........The Masks. Read the book that will CHANGE......YOUR......LIFE......FOREVER!!!"
5,I am a Zimbabwean!,I was born and grew up in Zimbabwe. I could not put down this delightful book with its wonderfully imaginative view of that country in the future. At the same time I found the background authentic. Nancy Farmer really knows and understands the people of Zimbabwe. Her describtion of traditional life there is vivid and sympathetic. For many years I taught young people who came from backgrounds depicted in her describtion of Resthaven
3,Superb!,"This book is the most futuristic one I have ever read, so They talk abouteverything from the Mile-high McIlwaine, which is a hotel that's over a milehigh (duh) to hover taxis and buses that fly around. It was interesting toread this book, because it was, in my opinion, a very accurate portrayal ofwhat the future will actually be like: divided into the rich and poorsections of a city. Well, the plot line is pretty simple. Three children,the children of the rich and powerful General Matsika, want some moreadventure in their lives, so they venture out of their safeguarded homeinto the big city, where they find the She-Elephant, a tyrant who wants tosell them to a gang called the Masks. There is a lot more in this storythat I'm not going to talk about, because I don't want to ruin the book,but there is one thing. Leave yourself plenty of time to read it,because it's a time gobbler. Happy Reading!"
5,"Top notch adventure, plus African history","What a great adventure story. It also informs readers about some aspects of the culture and history of one area of Africa. The author makes very good use of suspense to keep the reader going. I've read this to two fourth grade classes, and they couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen to the three children next. The final part of the book may be a little too suspenseful or frightening for some young readers. I warn my kids it gets pretty scary toward the end. Give this well written book to kids who like scary stories. The reading level is probably good 5th grade."
4,Good!,"This book was a very good book! It was suspenseful and full of action and adventure. The book is about three children, Tendai, Rita, and Kuda. They're father is General Matsika and he has never let them beyond the property line.But the children sneak out to have an adventure, but they didn't get exactly what they wanted. They are kidnapped and turned into slaves working at a toxic waste dump. When they escape they come to a place of peace, but the inhabitants make them stay forever. After a while they are acussed of witchcraft and are thrown out. They then take the subway to friend of the family's house, where they are cared for until they find out that the person is holding them for ransom. After they escape again they run into the lady from the waste dump and are taken to a bunch of gansters. The gansters are just about to sacrific them to the gods when thedetectives that have been looking for them all along, but always seem to get there too late, help in rescuing the kids."
5,"""This is a plastic mine...""","Harare Zimbabwe 2194. Cars fly. Robots and mechanical guard dogs maintain household order. Want to see real plastic? Go to a museum.Author Nancy Farmer lived 17 years in Africa. She creates complex, realistic characters, especially the Matiska children and the three detectives. Minor players - the She-Elephant, the Mellower, his mother - are also well-drawn. You remember them.Africa's future is tied to its past. Greed and prejudice still exist, but so do courage and resourcefulness. I liked how the native Shona spiritual world influences the characters.Unforgettable setting + humor + insight = unique adventure/coming of age novel for children and adults. I referred to the appendix and glossary throughout the book; both aided my understanding.This was the first Nancy Farmer book I tried. I look forward to reading more by this accomplished author."
4,The ear the eye and the arm: Overview,"Although this book is named for three extremely unusual detectives, this in now mystery. This was probably the biggest shock when i started to read this book. This book takes place in the twenty second century in Zimbabwe, which has just ended a war on crime. The general of the paramilitary police, General Matsika, has three children who disappear after trying to work a scouting merit badge. The General tries to discover the wereabouts of his children, but finds his military task force is too large for any undercover missions. He is forced to call upon three detectives, the last of their kind in Zimbabwe. And if you couldn't guess, they are called the ear the eye and the arm. Now this may sound like a mystery, except it keeps on switching back to the kidnapped kids view, which although ands adventure to an otherwise boring book, defeats the purpose of the mystery. Over all a good read, it's strengths cover it's faults"
3,"'The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm'","I thought that this book by Nancy Farmer was very well-written, yet hard to follow at some points, and vague in others. This book had many hidden meanings, which I am still trying to decipher. This book is a challenging read for people my age. Before I bought this product, I would have liked a more detailed overview on the back of the book. I found that the back flap only covered the first few pages. In this case, the author, Nancy Farmer, might have been trying to save parts of the book as a surprise, but some parts like the Masks and spirit presences might have been good information."
4,A Good Fantasy Book,"The Ear the Eye and the Arm, is a good book. It is about these three kids that all they want is some freedom. The mellower goes and gives that to them. They go out into the lage world, of Zimbabwe, Africa, not knowing what to do or where to go. So, they go onto a train. They get to a huge market, where the littlest chicl, Kuda, wants to see the animals. They go and then they see a blue monkey that can talk. To their surprise the monkey starts to talk to them about how the owner treats him very poorly. Then without realizing it, the Blue Monkey jumps up and bites Tendai (the oldest one). A lot of exciting things happen after that, but the only way you will find out is if you read this book, The Ear the Eye and the Arm."
4,"The Ear, the Eye and the Arm","The year is 2194, in Harare, Zimbabwe. The Chief of security of Zimbabwe, Amadeus Matsika, has 4 curious children. For all their life's, these children have only known, a guarded world, free of problems and violence. They have never been beyond their families estates walls. There house is guarded by cameras, robots and guards!One day all four children decide to escape and visit the city. This is only the beginning of an incredible adventure that these children will take. When these children get lost over night, there cautious parents will get the Ear, the Eye and the Arm involved!The Ear, the Eye and the Arm by Nancy farmer is a great science fiction book! This author's style of writing is for the person that likes an exciting, fast moving style of writing. I enjoyed this book because it combines mystery with futuristic science fiction."
3,It's pretty good.,"This book was kind of boring. It is about Tendai, Rita, and Kuda. Their father is General Matsika. He doesn't let them out of the house all their life. It's kind of slow moving the first 100 pages. But it gets better. They get kidnapped by the She Elephant, who forces them to work in a plastic mine. When they escape, they go to Resthaven, a village that once you go in, if you are accepted, you never get out. But they escape and go to the mellower's mother's house. She takes care of them until Tendai finds out that she is holding them for ransom. Then the She Elephant kidnaps them again from the mellower's house and I forgot what happens after that. So you will have to read it to find out. But I wouldn't have read it if I didn't have to for a book report. Overall, it was a worthy effort to make an exciting story.But it is boring."
3,Not what expected,"I began my reading of this novel with great expectations ... the premise sounded intriguing. Alas, I was disappointed. Two separate stories were being told (one about the ear, the eye, and the arm ... the other about three kidnapped children), each interesting in their own right, but awkwardly pieced together... fragmented. To be honest, the majority of the story is about the children - I wished it had focused more on the three detectives. The novel, after all, is named after them ... their story would've been more relevant to learn."

2,"The Ear, The Eye, and The Arm","Imagine you live in a walled fortress called home. Far away from the excitements of the outside world, and you are only surrounded by robot servants and robot dogs. Wouldn't that be boring? That is why thirteen- year- old Tendai, his sister Rita, and little brother Kuda ran way into the heart of Zimbabwe.The three kids escaped with no knowledge of how to ride a bus, train, or subway. This worried their parents so much that they contacted the three unusual detetives The Ear, The Eye, and The Arm. But unfortunately these detectives are always just one step behind the children. During the kid's escape, they face many problems, like being captured, lost and even the worst thing had happened to them; they were sold to the evil gang of Zimbabwe The Masks.Who are these Masks?

5,"Fast-paced, well-written mystery","If it is a mystery book readers want, Nancy Farmer has definately brought a whole new world of adventure for us. This excellent story stretches from the past, present, and future while managing to keep you on the edge of your seat.This story starts with three children escaping outside the boundaries of their guarded home to find rude monkies, people of the earth, vicious thieves, dishonest mothers, and MUCH more.

Dare to read it at night!"
4,A futuristic novel full of suspence,"This is one of the best books I have read in a long while. It takes place in the Zimbabwe in the year 2194. It is a wonderful science fiction book ful of suprises and suspence. It has to deal with a lot of spirits and that makes it a little weird, but overall it is an amazing book."
5,The best adventure with history and the future!!!,"The children have gone out into the city for the first time in their lives! Tendai promises to be back by night-time. They are captured in Mbare Musika by cheap blue monkey trick and were smuggled into Dead Man's Vlei! What will they do now?

4,Oregon brand canned plums,"Due to a diet that dictates eating only a few types of fruit, I have found that these Oregan brand canned plums not only meet my dietary standards but also taste quite good. I have been eating them for a number of years and find it one fruit that I do not tire of eating. I recommend them to everyone."
5,Purple plums,"For some unknown reason, grocery stores in my area (Northern Va.) have stopped selling this product. In some ways, I prefer canned plums to fresh ones; the flavor is more concentrated."
3,Disappointing,"I am a very amateur birder, but as we are planning a move to Texas I wanted to know what types of birds we might encounter there. I thought this book would be the best choice, but I was disappointed. The pictures of the birds are very well done, but the habitat map guide is not helpful at all. It is of the entire US, not just Texas, and many of the birds in the book are not even shown as having Texas as a habitat. The insets of similar birds is a good idea, but is way to small to be of much use. I guess I'll have wait until I get to Texas and look through books at an actual bookstore in order to find a good guide."
4,"Adrift at sea, and now she's found","Avast ye speaker-bound landlubbers! Here be a fine discovery, 'tis for sure. Sir Patrick Spens, Herbert Howells' first large work for chorus and orchestra, mayhap be a belaying pin less than entirely original, but throughout the 20-minute work invention is ever replaced by enthusiasm,and the energy of both the piece and the performers never flags.One can clearly hear the composer joyful at being momentarily released from the strictures of writing for the church, as if he had the salt sea air itself blowin' a nor'easter through his imagination as he set words to music. 'Tis as robust a bit of orchestral chanty as is to be found, and you'll do yourself a good turn several times 'round the capstan if you buy this one.Howells' Hymnus paradisi is known and reviewed elsewhere, and this too be a fine performance, but it's safe to say there be as many hymns and as much paradise in Sir Patrick Spens as in what follows it, harp...I mean, har!"
2,Disconnect,The product worked fine for about an hour. I have to reboot the machine and reconfigure the card in order to use it and it will still lose its signal within an hour or so. The machine is about 30 feet from the router and I have checked for driver and software updates.
5,Fun,"Malcolm Arnold's many sets of Anglo-Saxon Dances are fun, light-hearted pieces that capture the folk music of the many cultures of the United Kingdom. This CD features the English, Scottish, Cornish, and Irish Dances (only missing the Welsh). My favorites are the more popular English and Scottish Dances, but the Irish and Cornish are still enjoyable to listen to. These pieces capture melodies that will sound very familiar and that you'll be surprised you've never heard before. After listening to these tunes, you'll catch yourself gaily whistling a Scottish reel."
3,Must know what you are getting into...,"I will not be going into detail as much as the other reviewers, as they have pretty much covered all the technical details. However, I will emphasize on one key aspect of this card... DO NOT EXPECT TO GET QUALITY PERFORMANCE OUT OF THIS CARD USING THE PROVIDED DRIVERS. I received the card and immediately noticed problems. First of all, if you aren't familiar with N technology, you will not be getting 300MBs speeds unless using 40mhz transmission on your router. Secondly, and the most important thing, you have to use an Atheros driver to achieve uninterrupted service. The driver can be located here ([...]) This is the only way many have gotten this card to perform to it's potential. After using this driver, I believe it is a great card. If the provided drivers worked, I would rate 4 or 5 stars. I hope this review helps people because with a working driver, it is a great card. I failed to mention that these issues occurred while using Windows 7."
1,"router is stops working after 10 minutes, requires a constrant computer restart","Router stops working after 10 minutes, requires a constant computer restartManufacture agreed to replace it, however I have to pay shipping charges and wait few weeks,"
5,Good product..,what ever people say bad about this lie. work with vista ultimate...not need to change anythins. instal driver from cd
1,worst peice of garbage.,"same as the router it compliments.peice of garbage.I installed this into my system, my system doesn't see it.doesn't recognise that new hardware has been installed.I cannot install the drivers or anything, because of this. It is totally useless, and Dlink technical support? you may as well just take your head and smack it against the wall, it will have the same effect as talking to these people, but you will save the phone bills and wait times and condescending tones as they tell you to do the most stupid things you ever heard."
3,Didn't really work well,Reception was really weak. I replaced this with a wireless N USB adapter from Belkin and went from about %11 reception to %50. Too bad because the D-Link extreme wireless router I have is awesome.
1,Worst 802.11 PCI adapter I have ever used.,"I'm a computer geek.I have been building/fixing computer since 1996I used various network adapters 3com, linksys, d-link, Airlink101, etcI was happy with my cheap airlink101 n card which i bought about 3 years ago,but I switched to D-link hoping to get some performace boost.Computer randomly crashes with it, and It have random lag problem.at first I thought it was memory or other problems.. but after long trouble shooting method, I realized it's the driver problem.by installing 3rd party driver, my problem has been solved, but I had to installed that manually.I have two of these, and one of them just died after about 1 month of use.I re-installed my cheapo Airlink101 n card and my PC is running great.Buggy software. stay away. these extreme-n card is extremely buggy!"
3,Not What I Expected,I replaced a wireless G adapter with this N adapter expecting a vast improvement. Sorry to say I am disappointed. I am using it with a D-Link Dir-655 N router. While there is a slight improvement in signal strength and through put I would not recomend spending this much money on it. I would spend the money on the router and use your existing G adapter. The only thing that may be hurtng the performance is that the computer it is installed in is not that robust.It has a 1.5 Pentium chip and 768 Gb memory using XP SP#3.
5,Great Product,"I bought this network adapter almost a year ago to replace a Linksys Wireless-G adapter in my media center as part of an upgrade from G to N wireless network. My media center is in my living room on the main floor while my router (D-Link DIR-655, another excellent product) is in the basement. The two component are fairly far from each other and are separated by walls and ceiling. The old Linksys adapter provided poor connectivity (60-70%) while this new D-Link adapter is constantly providing 97-100% connectivity.Some additional notes:- I use the D-Link ANT24-0230 antenna with this adapter because my media center is buried in a cabinet.- My media center was initially running Windows Vista Home Premium but was upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium. Both operating systems identified the card and installed it on the first try without any manual help.- I am streaming HD content from my network server over this connection without any glitches or distortions.Overall, an excellent product."
2,HORRIBLE RANGE,My computer is less than 20 feet from the router and I get a whole 3 bars tops. If you move it another 5 feet it drops to 1. Anything further than that and forget about a signal. The card is fast but the range sucks. I would not recommend this card to anyone who has to get a signal more than 15 feet away from their router. Don't understand why DLINK would design something so poorly. Two stars because its a good card if you don't need the range.
1,Pathetic,"I have a small, 2 bedroom bungalow with a router on one side and the PC on the other. All other devices (phones, tablets, laptops, etc) have no issues with the range.This card, with it's 3 impressive antennae, surely will kick their butt, no? Needless to say, the highest signal I got was 3 bars, but only for fleeting moments in time. The average was one bar, and about 40% of the time I got zero bars. In case ppl are wondering, if the PC was moved into the same room as the router, yes, it worked fine.As mentioned by another poster on this product, he thought the problem with these PCI cards in general is that they are positioned at the back of the PC. I have to agree with him.I returned the card to my local Future Shop, and returned with a Linksys AE3000 USB N Adapter. I don't know I had to get something to pricey, but I was scared to have to make a 3rd trip to the store. Luckily, it's working like a champ."
2,software installation crashed my system drive,"I purchased a custom computer and its internal antenae was faulty. Manufacturersent this as a repalcement. After installing the hardware, I was unable to get a sucessfullinstall from the CD. Further efforts led to hard drife crashes and now I am working hourswith tech support to reinstall Windows 7 on my systerm. I guess it could be problem with thedrive, as the computer has had numerous issues. But some other reviews also mention problems with installing thedrivers fromt he CD.. Instructions are inconsistent too, one says to install device first then CD, other says the opposite.Welcome to th modern age where your fortunate to find anything that works as i should out of the box."
1,Windows 7 Problems,This network card does not work with Windows 7. I had problems when I installed it where it would drop network connections and performs slowly.Hopped onto Google and realized that MANY other folks were having problems as well. Very disappointed and now am scrambling to find something before Christmas.
1,"Could never get wireless ""N"" to work","I have NetGear wireless router that exposes a wireless G and wireless N network. I have never been able to connect to the wireless N network. I spent about a half a day with various customer service folks and eventually they wore me down by asking the same questions over and over, and I gave up. Moreover, my connection ""drops"" frequently, and rarely comes back after my computer goes to sleep for very long (day or two).I will eat the $60 that this adapter cost me and go buy something else."
2,Poor speed.,"Even with a D-Ling wireless router 30 feet away, I couldnt get full wireless N speed which made it useless in streaming HD movies to my TV."
5,D-Link adapter card,This product has been performing top notch for me. It doubled my wireless signal and improved it to be a constant reliable connection. I give it an A+++++
1,Does NOT work on Windows 7,"From the start when installing this device, Windows provides an error stating that Windows 7 requires a digitally signed driver and that without one the program that operates it will not function. At first the device connected to our home wifi but would only stay connected intermittently. Now it does not even see any wireless networks at all. I've been on the phone countless times with both Microsoft and D-Link, Microsoft was unable to fix the problem and D-Link representatives kept giving me ignorant people who (some never used Windows before, only Mac) that either did not know what a digitally signed driver was, and kept giving me the same driver I have (that doesn't work). The device may very well work on XP or Vista (I haven't tried) but I can assure you, it will not operate on Windows 7."
5,great.,the kamas are well made. strong unsharpen blades are great for training. the strings kept falling off. so beware of that. i knoted and then melt the tips so it wouldn't get loose. works fine. i am 100% satisfied with this purchase.
5,Quality,I bought the Kamas for my son in karate. They're very sturdy and after research found them to be a decent price. They actually come with plastic protectors for the blades (If I'd know that earlier I may not have purchased the case). My son loved them!
4,perfect replacement for the OEM alternator,"Bought this alternator on price and other customer reviews. The alternator was a perfect fit (hold-down h/w, pulley, & connectors) and installed easily. It has been working great for approximately 1 month. I don't know about long-time performance and that is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars."
4,A Little Known Gem,"For some reason, Walton's ballet ""The Quest"" is not well known. It should be. It has all the wonderful features of Walton's orchestral music (a touch of romantic lyricism, modern harmony, melodic invention, masterful orchestration, etc.) including a treat from one of masters of the variation - variations based on the Seven Deadly Sins. It is fun to try to guess which variation belongs to which Sin before you read the track titles (I got four out of seven, but the fourth was just a guess). The final movement, ""The House of Holiness"" is truly majestic. If you have Walton's orchestral music your collection is incomplete without this piece. ""The Wise Virgins"" is Walton's orchestration of some of Bach's music. I found this collection somewhat disappointing - I thought the orchestration would be a bit more inventive, a bit less conventional. Still, I am happy to own this orchestration by Walton, and the inclusion of ""The Quest"" makes this CD well worth the price."
2,Stan and Ollie Buried in Excess Footage,"Despite the box-office success of ""Pack Up Your Troubles"" and ""Sons of the Desert,"" producer Hal Roach believed that Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy could not sustain a full-length comedy without a secondary plot. As a result, ""Bonnie Scotland"" (1935) squandered an opportunity to effectively lampoon ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer."" Submerged in a schizophrenic storyline, Stan and Ollie manage to provide several classic moments. The Boys' impromptu dance number remains a definite highlight.OVERALL RATING: **"
1,AN INSULT TO SCOTTISH PEOPLE,"This is the worst Laurel and Hardy film, for one it isnt funny, and two the supporting cast's ability to play Scottish people was awful, more than half the people in the cast have American accents. I have an example, the leading actress has the strongest American accent of them and she says: ""I don't want to leave Scotland, I have lived here my whole life"". Give me a break."
4,Meat chopper,"I tried this out for the first time this morning. It does an excellent job, but there is a slight metallic taste to the food that I hope goes away after it's used more. Basically, it isn't as handy as a Cuisineart food processor, but it is a good alternative for the price. It is more complicated to clean- lots of parts to correctly reassemble later- but not so much so that you can't get it right if you think about what you are doing."
4,"very, very good","This is a very good book, not just on the subject of Alleyn, but on the subject of theatre in Elizabethan times. Even better than I had hoped."
4,Disability awareness,"This book is chock full of useful, practical information. You truly have to read it more than once to get the full benefit of all it contains. Each chapter covers a different disability category. One excellent feature is the Readings and Resources section in each and every chapter! This book will make you think and questions some misconceptions you may have."
4,A must see rarity for Lindsay Anderson fans,"Interesting 47 minute short from a Shelagh Delaney short story. A girl quits her dull job, and goes on a surrealistic bus tour of a dilapidatedManchester, UK. Along for the ride are a strange mix, including a lascivious vicar, lord mayor (Arthur Lowe, always great), etc.Many of the techniques that became part of `If' and `O Lucky Man' first show up here.(e.g. mixing color and B+W). It also follows `O Lucky Man'in being a surreal journey of a somewhat passive, young lead character traveling through a world where they have little power. Enigmatic,sure, but it's interesting and entertaining in a Brechtian/Anderson sort of dark humored politically satirical way. Cleary it's making fun of the patheticnature of modern society and our desperate need to justify all the glories of `progress that really sap our humanity. Some terrific and haunting images.Note; a young Anthony Hopkins shows up very briefly singing German!"
4,Good Information better keep it handy,"Leonardo is the best example of the great human potential. He stands out in mathematics, physics, engineering, aeronautics, architecture, drawing, painting and sculpture. Why could he master so many endeavors?Michael explains in details the lateral way of thinking of Leonardo, based on his curiosity in everything, that helped him develop an immense creativity for methodology. Don't think that these are quick fix techniques, they require a whole lot of discipline, but it is worth it."
1,In the woods,"Wood leads us into the woods, leaving fact and reality behind. His book, like his 'documentary', leverages all of the latest and greatest speculation into a miraculous and utterly fictional portrait. He would do well to read Schoenbaum, not to mention Price. As entertainment, a 'C'. As biography, an 'F'."
5,Based on Speculation And Theory - Thankfully,"This wonderfully illustrated book is not for those seeking in-depth literary theories about Shakespeare's work, but if you're interested in Shakespeare's life I think this book is a must. Yes, the book is filled with speculation - none of it outlandish - about the possible events in Shakespeare's life, but Mr. Wood always presents evidence for his theories. Just as important, Mr. Wood, unlike many critics and biographers, tries to connect events in Shakespeare's life to his work, e.g. how his son's death made him a greater writer.I suspect many will condemn Mr. Wood for his speculation, but when it comes to much of Shakespeare's life, what else can we do but speculate?Also, Mr. Wood paints a vivid, compelling picture of life in London during the Elizabethan Era.Finally, this book has an excellent theory about why and for whom the sonnets were written.Reading this book made me feel as if I almost knew Shakespeare."
4,love spode,"These mats were ok. but my original ones which were made by Spode in England were far superior quality. These are just transferred pattern stuck to cork, are not laminated and do not last as long."
2,cop outfit,i did not like this product. It was described as being very nice. It came quick but was very cheap. It didn't met my expectations. The only plus was it was easy to return
3,Not worth the price,"This was a very expensive DVD, and I bought it in hopes of enjoying it. Not a lot of spectacular action in this DVD. Don't waste your money."
3,Neither friend nor foe,"Methinks thou protests too much. This book is a long tantrum of poor me, how the white man stripped us of everything, and how the white man is exploiting the Indian still. Nerburn whines as much as the old man whose life he is chronicling. Neither makes the point for resolution or reconciliation. I can agree there are those who are Indian wannabees; I can agree that several hundred years ago, some callus, stupid Europeans destroyed a rich and valuable culture. But how does whining over that for several hundred pages help? The elder alternately complains because the white man doesn't want to learn about the Indian culture and because the white man wants to learn about the Indian culture. It is very simple for him. Indian good, white man bad. And everything since Columbus landed is the white man's fault. I don't buy it, and I don't recommend you do either."
3,Readers Digest,I think Nerburn watched Native American movies and read Native American books and condensed his aquired learning into a profitable book. I prefer the personalized stories. You can't reduce 100 million human beings into 1 story.
3,Okay read.,"It's an okay read, interesting but a little tough to get through at some parts, feels like it's a bit too much about the author sometimes."
4,Reflection,"This book delves quite a bit into the akward relationship white America has with one of the many groups it has subjugated. It may have many flaws, but is still worth the time for at least a few nuggets."
5,A Classic,"I first encountered this book in a Native American bookstore in South Dakota. Once I started reading, I literally could not stop, and I finished it in a day. I now have it in electronic form, and I have reread it a couple of times. Enlightening, non condescending, sympathetic without being pitying, Nerburn has given us an enduring classic that still informs and moves us. If you want a glimpse of how Native Americans view the society that conquered and dominated them, then start here. It will prompt you to find out more."
4,Sailor Moon To The Future,This SM cd is in all Japanese and one of the best. It is worth the money to get this cd.
2,Not about Anusara,"Although this book is touted on several Anusara web sites as a book about Anusara, I found it to be more about self-loathing and a poor body image. From cover to cover, the author rehashed her, and other's, disfunctions and poor self-esteem related to a poor body image and eating disorders.Now, if you fall into any of the afore mentioned catagories, you may find this book for you. If not, it's a waste of time. (I too have looked in the mirror during a yoga session and thought, jeez, I'm going to have to not eat for the next month...., but I didn't dwell on it. And I don't consider a new pedicure when gazing at my feet in down dog.)My truly, heart felt advice to those of you whom this book will speak to is, spend less time on the mat and more in meditation, until you get your mind under control. I am saddened for anyone who is their own worst enemy. Life is too short.Yoga, and all it's attendant traditions, are so much more. Let it be so for you."
4,wonderful book,"I read the reviews before I bought this book so I knew for the most part what to expect. I enjoyed reading it, and have used it as a jumping off point in my own yoga journey."
2,Great Book for Driving!,"I'm an unusually short man (4'11""), so I find that ""Institutions of Modernism"" is the perfect book to sit on while I'm driving my car. I was using the phonebook for a while, but that was a hassle -- I mean, the phonebook actually has useful information it. But not this book, boy howdy. Thanks to Mr. Rainey, I can now view oncoming traffic."
4,"positive, enticing","This book satisfies me on many counts, not least of them the reminder of how much time and care is taken in Japan to present food exquisitely, with love and care. I like to cook up a dish in 10 minutes; the author describes taking three years to learn to make noodles! I have to learn to take more time, increasing my pleasure and that of those I serve with food---and this book is a perfect guide on that path. For hot humid New Zealand summers, soba makes a marvellous difference, served as a cold salad. All my conventional extended family, ""meat and two vege"" people, are exclaiming at the noodles I serve with the help of James Udesky's book. Clear recipes to follow; all it takes is care and mindful attention to detail. Thank you James.---Trish Gribben"
2,Thought about it,"Was thinking of buying this, but my manual says any good quality SAE 30 detergent oil is fine, and I could even get a quart of synthetic 10W-30 (which can also stand up to higher temps) for less. Maybe good value for some who think they need or want OEM."
4,Works great - but way overpriced,"I do product shoots with my Nikon D200 and have the need to use the camera for a long period of time. The adapter works really well but is ridiculously overpriced at $80. There is really nothing special that I could see about this adapter that justifies the price.However,it does the job and if you need to have one you're stuck with only one choice."
5,94 Vette Corsa Exhaust,Awesome product!! Great sound when you get on the gas. Nice low tone when you're just driving around town or cruising at a stable speed. Easy to install. I installed it in the parking lot of my apartment complex but I would HIGHLY recommend getting it on a lift to install it. Be prepared to replace a couple studs or nuts for the driver side catalytic converter.
1,Terrible Textbook,"I have to agree with the reviewer above me. This book is awful. The sample problems skip steps, don't show formulas and don't have enough explanation. If you're going to use this textbook for a course, I suggest you buy a supplement because this textbook will leave you confused."
4,"Shipped quickly, good quality text book",The item shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. This was perfect since I needed it for a class. The book itself has a nice layout for learning the topics. There are plenty of diagrams to visually interpret the topics. At the end of every chapter there are many practice problems to work through with about half of the answers in the back.
4,Pinyin full of mistakes; otherwise a good book,"This is a good book for those interested in reading classical Chinese texts on their own. The glossaries are very useful, making it easy for those with a basic knowledge of classical Chinese to read new texts from various periods. Pinyin is provided throughout the book along with traditional characters, but the pinyin contains quite a few mistakes. A pity that they didn't have someone proofread it; I'm certain anyone with a basic knowledge of Chinese would've noticed the mistakes.If you already have a basic knowledge of Chinese, I can wholeheartedly recommend this book: it's a great way to read poetry and prose from many periods in Chinese history, even though there are mistakes here and there. On the other hand, if you don't think you'd be able to spot the mistakes and intend to study the new words you might be better off using another book."
5,Thompson Grapes a must have for Fruit Salad,"Thompson grapes work so well in my fruit salad. My family has been making this fruit salad for about 50 years. Originially we used fresh grapes, but the Thompson grapes work so much better. They are not sour and just right. I order Thompson grapes by the box because it is so much cheaper to get 8 in a pack. Buying a couple at a time can be expensive at the grocery store. I also find that I can't always find the grapes in stock at my local grocer. So buy Thompson grapes you will love them!"
5,A toddler favorite,"I personally have not tried these, but after my 2-year-old son continually picked the grapes out of his fruit cocktail and eschewed the pears, peaches, and pineapple, I am glad to have found plain canned grapes. He absolutely loves them!"
4,Logitech EasyFit Headset,"I have spent [...] for headsets without this good of reception. I didn't give it a 5-star, because it does take a bit of getting used to and is a little hard on the ear until the adjustments are right. Still it's an excellent headset for the money!"
3,This book offered an extroardianry look at Bliss' works.,"The author effectively showed the works of Bliss Caramn as pieces of art. His/her comments were straight and to the point. They reflected those of an experienced critic. Bliss Carman was a talented author, and all of his books of peotry were works of art."
1,Don't even bother,"This started off as a good idea, but very soon I got fed up with the typos and grammatical errors. Then, I was amazed to see the authors couldn't even follow their own story line...towards the end of the book they mix up their characters. And there are too many incomplete story lines for such a short book, absolutely no character development. All and all, a poor attempt."
2,dissapointing,"An isolated island with the last shreds of humanity isolated from a zombie-infested world...A graphic murder of practicality in the opening pages...A surviving military squadron landing on the island...Sounds good, right?Enter the typical INTELIGENT zombie and watch in disgust as it and every other zombie on the planet are destroyed as some guy who is appearantly some kind of demigod... ready for this? starts to CRY!!!! Please.At least the writing wasn't bad, just the plot."
1,"a rotten wind blows,from this book.","Save your money and your time, stay away from this turkey!!!.It is a complete and utter ripoff of 'brain kneen""s, the rising, anyone who has read the rising an city of the dead,will know this to be true!!. cobble may have some novel touches to it , but that can not save it from being one lame duck of a book. I Will not ruin this book for those who may still want to read this piece of excrement, others reviews will have given away enough about it already, there are far better books you could read like""Wetwork"" by philip nutman ,still the best zombie novel,followed by brain keene."
3,Didn't like the ending,"This book was good, don't get me wrong. The storyline was good but their were a few mistakes. The only thing I didn't like was the ending of it. I think it drifted too far away from the original concept of the book, but then again I didn't finish reading the end because I didn't like it. I had about 4 pages left and I didn't like the ending so I quit it. But this book was good and suspenseful so I'd say you get your moneyworth."
2,Mildly Amusing,"The book is mostly just a collection of quotations from professionals in the entertainment business. The quotes and copy are hacked together in an amateurish fashion reminiscent of a bad high school term paper.If you're interested in the subject and have read a couple of books on ""breaking in"" to the business in Hollywood, Directing Your Directing Career will offer very little new insight. If you're interested in the subject and HAVEN'T read any books on it, Hollywood 101 is the best of the genre. Skip this one.You can glean some good tips from the quotations, though, and sometimes they are mildly entertaining. Two stars for the work involved in all of the interviews."
5,"When distrust prevails, vigilante societies arise.","Exactly what I was looking for. Very informative.And to think what might have been if they could have just trusted their neighbors and one another. A protection system arose out of distrust for others. Sounds like another form of a gang society. How different are they than the 9th Street Gang who mark their territory and distrust anyone who enters? This observation is from a descendent of a ""campieri"" - one who protected the fields."
1,Beware...,"This version of ""Half-Life"" is a ""jewel case"" re-packaging of the ""Game of the Year Edition"". I wanted to buy this from my local store because of the great price ($12 Cdn.) but thought better of it after I read the back. What you should be wary of is on the back of the case it says (very clearly) that after a certain amount of time, you MUST activate and register the game with the publisher (this involves giving your credit card number) or else you won't be able to play anymore. I would probably rate the game higher than one star but, I haven't played it because of these greedy business practices."
2,was looking for more information,"I was looking for a DVD about the voyage from Seattle, WA to Juneau, AK. This video has good image quality, but I was looking for more information on the journey, the boat and nature.The ""movie"" is a collection of landscape shots of the Canadian and Alaskan waters of the Inside Passage; then set to overly dramatic music. Considering the content of the film; it surprised me there were no ""deleted scenes"" segment on the DVD.There is an option to watch the movie with director's comments. I watched it first and found I enjoy the comments version better. Directors comments gave me more information which really was what I was looking for to begin with...but still fell short."
3,Need detailed specs to compare,"This type of magnet has a grade, and each size has a holding power; both should be stated. Otherwise, information is lacking which enables comparison to other similar products."
2,Very Attractive Magnets at an Unattractive Price,"As far as quality goes, these magnets are great. I ordered them in October of 2007 (for various craft projects) and was coming back for more when the enormous jump in price stopped me in my tracks.What was previously $25 is now $32. Maybe rare earth magnets got so rare that they are now almost extinct?and $11 for shipping? These magnets are strong, but heavy they are not. Previously shipping was $6.50 and even then it was a little high. Priority mail postage for an item like this costs $3.00 at the post-office. Throw it in a box, tape it up, drive to the post office to mail it and maybe I can see the $6.50. But $11? No way. I will not be ordering from this seller again.If you really really need these specific magnets, buy them, they work great. But you might want to get a second job to pay the jacked up prices."
4,great if you have a bat mitzvah?,"I thought this book was going to be about some rich girls bat mitzvah. i also thought that it was going to be good for girls that have had or is going to have a bat mitzvah. i was like oo i am going to love this book. i was totally wrong though. i thought it was really enjoyable to read though. i read it in just 2 days!! this book is more like a book about friendship. it is kind of typical story for a girls life (if you and your friends are really dramatic). I think girls whose friends and them have a lot of drama going on in their life will love this book! Even if not you will like it. this is a great beach read, it is a page turner!! oh and if you didnt catch on you do not have to be jewish to read this book i think."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I read this book to gain a better understanding of the Jewish Batmitzvah and was sorely disappointed. This book is about girl drama and nothing more. True there were some laughs, but this book cannot be judged by its cover because religion is the back story. These kids just happen to be Jewish.Then I was shown an article blog by the author, where she admits that Fiona Rosenbloom is a pen name and she has absolutely NO AUTHORITY or knowledge about the Jewish religion. Basically, she was approached to write the book and saw it as a chance to make some money. She even chose a Jewish sounding pen name, and dresses up in a wig when she does author appearances. Even after admitting to not knowing what she was talking about, she went on to write a sequel.PLEASE PLEASE do not give this author your money. There are better books out there! Unless you just want to read about girl drama, don't let this cover fool you."
5,Post Bat Mitzvah Reader,I was given this book just 5 days before my bat mitzvah and instead of studying i read it constintly i couldn't put it down!!!!!!!!!!!!!IT WAS THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ
1,Mistitled,"I would agree with elements of ""The Bully Pulpit""s review, below, in that the biography element of this book concerning Julius Streicher is minimal and shallow. The great majority of the book is concerned with describing and attacking anti-semitism in general and in some cases specifically where it was used by Julius Streicher in his newspaper Der Sturmer.Had I wanted a book detailing anti-semitism, I would have sought one out. In this instance I thought I was buying a biography of Julius Streicher, but this turned out not to be the case.I can not really recommend this book for readers seeking to find out more about the life of Julius Streicher."
5,Probably one of the best books I've ever read!,"I felt the author was there while I was reading and was explaining everything, and everyone to me alone."
4,Excellent for ulcers,"I just got two bottles of DGL after having tried of for a couple of weeks. It is excellent. I used to have acid reflux and what I thought could be an ulcer. The only thing that made it better was DGL. The only disadvantage is the taste, in my opinion. Two much stevia added. But, at least it's a natural sweetener, so, it's not a big problem.I would recommend it to people suffering from ulcers or any digestive problems. AND, I think that something important while doing the treatment is to make sure to reduce the level of stress, if possible. These problems are often linked to emotions, as many diseases are.The shipping was very fast. Thank you."
5,Good for the tummy!,One of my friends told me about DGL after their doctor recommended it to them. I have been taking this product for almost a year now 3 times/day and it helps a lot. I have osteoporosis and the calcium gives me digestive problems but the DGL takes care of it. Will probably order it for the rest of my life.
2,Nasty!,"I can't stand the taste of the stevia sweetener that they put in these! Yuck! I usually like NOW brand products, but I'm going to go back with the Natural Factors DGL because it's the same potency as these but without the stevia."
1,Yuk,I will never know if these work. They are disgusting to taste. There is no way I could do it. I asked my husband if he wanted them and he has the same reation. I hava them on my desk to see if I can get any takers. No luck so far. It's a taste thing.
2,dgl,This product irritated my stomach. I should not have purchased it. my fault sense knowing how sensitive the ole gut is.
3,I don't know why I take this!,I was prescribed this by Dr. Prudence Hall at the Hall center for health in Santa Monica CA over a year ago. She said it was for lowering my blood sugar levels as a diabetes treatment. I have been taking this regularly and I still don't have diabetes in spite of the fact that I eat sweet tarts candy daily. I think I will stop taking them when I finish this bottle because I don't feel any different whether I take them or not. Of course that means I'll have to give up candy as well ;)
4,Awesome little toy.,"This is a great little toy, or not so little. My only complaint is that the ""B"" Trailer (second trailer for non-Cdl's) doesn't stay connected to the back of ""A"" Trailer (1st trailer for non-Cdl's). I just use a binder clip to keep the front of ""B"" attached to the back of ""A"". No biggie, I wish all truck problems were this easy to fix."
1,very cheaply made,"Broke before I even had it all the way out of the box, but the boys still wanted to play with it so we kept it. Very disappointed though."
1,Statement of Purpose,"I bought this book hoping to receive some good advice on how to write a statement of purpose and she provided two examples. However, I was extremely disappointed when I read the examples because they are written by people who have experiences that most law school applicants don't. I haven't been in the Coast Guard for 8 years and I haven't been a researcher at a top hospital...She gives no good advice for the normal law school applicant. SKIP THIS BOOK!"
2,Not so good,This book is not good. There are much better books that explain what is included in the book. I would only advise buying this book if you need help in writing a request for a recommendation letter because that is the only informative section in this book.
4,Law School Applicants Must Read,This book is full of great hints and common mistakes. It is an easy read and I highly recommend it for anybody that is applying to law school.
4,Perfect for all needs,This was well done. Referred to it often and helped guide me through this process on many larger issues as well as what may seem to be minor issues.I credit this book with my acceptance and making Law Review in my first year. Thank you.
5,Ivey is Perfect!,"Anna Ivey writes one hell of a great book! I read and dog-eared this book from cover to cover. I also contacted Ivey directly regarding my personal statement and I found her kind, caring, understanding, knowledgeable, and generous with her time. If you're thinking of applying for law school, this is the #1 book I recommend. Whether law school, at its current price, is the best choice for you is another matter.-Dom"
5,stickers,they are cool. there's also a dot in the middle that you can use as well. They stay in place even with lotion on. also in a pinch you can reuse them if you put them back on their paper. I'm not cheap I just forgot to bring new ones.
4,Nat'L Geo Topo! PA NJ,"Excellent global search capabilities; tools are organic and easy to understand; only complaint is the limited ability to frame a map I want to print; on the whole, will recommend to other hunters and fishers I know"
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought this software based on the belief it would show trail maps for hiking. Trail maps are only available via a download (not a big deal), but trail maps for PA and NJ don't exist!!!If you want maps that show existing trail maps for hiking in PA, do not purchase this software."
3,"Misleading Amazon listing - says quantity of 6, you get 3","This order was received today, BUT, it contained only ONE package of THREE bags.I was expecting ONE package of SIX bags, as indicated on Amazon.com AND as shown in the ""ORDER DETAILS"" and the ""SHIPPING DETAILS"" below:Eureka 60295B-6 Disposable Dust Bags Type MMPrice: $6.48In Stock.Ships from and sold by GoVacuum."
2,The Sub woofer is very weak for being an active Sub,The Surround and bookshelf speakers sound great the sub woofer hits like a mouse and crackles if I put the sub volume 2 mpoints above minimum look some where else if want to feel any sort of rumble. I will be replacing the Sub and keeping the others
4,A Descent Collection of Articles on AI and Cognition,"Very interesting collection of articles about cognition, brain ,AI , machine learning and generally adaptive intelligent systems and cognitive science."
2,To Much for what you Get,This is a cheaply made product that is not worth the cost. The shielding is very thin and does not provide a significant advantage of other speaker wire you can purchase. This is not worth the extra cost.
2,lame,"This book promises much more than it delivers. I found it to be ridiculous - suggesting that excerise during pregnancy is silly because you're just going to get fat anyway, that drinking diet coke is just fine and that husbands are generally worthless and don't expect any help or support from them. The author promotes the use of drugs during labor and can't seem to understand that not everyone shares her views. Save your money and your time. This book attempted to scare you into her way of thinking. To me this seemed more like a justification for her behavior during her four pregnancies rather than a sincere helpful guide. Yeah thanks for the tip on not wearing half shirts when you're 7 months prego!"
1,"""Grandma's Guide""","Ok, I picked up this book, thinking, ""Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"". This should be a current, hip book about being pregnant! I am disappointed to report that it is the complete opposite. The first thing I thought when I finished reading was that this should be renamed, ""Grandma's Guide to Pregnancy."" This book is in desperate need of a revision. The author refers to stir-up pants and the show Cheers as if they are still currently ""en vogue."" She also recommends not exercising during pregnancy, making comments like ""no one ever looks fit during pregnancy."" This was clearly written before anybody saw Madonna pregnant, and that was over 9 years ago. I gained no insight, and certainly could not relate to the author. I would not recommend this book to any woman currently pregnant who is looking for a ""girlfriend"" experience."
2,"Okay, but a few things bugged me.","This book is amusing, but as a first time mom, and scared to death, this book didn't really help me much. There are a few cute parts, but the overall negative attitudes towards 'natural childbirth' and her comments about the 'dismissive/apathetic' father really, really bugged me. My husband is not like that, in any way. After finishing this book, I realized I -did not- want to go through this experience alone. And this book didn't help reassure me.It's too bad, because there are some really cute parts in it, but I would not recommend it to new, young, Wiccan/Pagan, 'New Age' or Natural Childbirth focussed moms."
4,"Fun, but realistic.","I loved this bok, it tells you like it really is, instead of the lovey-dovey silliness of some pregnancy books out there. I enjoyed knowing that it was not only me who was sometimes just really fed up with the moody upheavals of hormonal inbalance and strageness of new body habits. While I did not feel that it gave much serious information, there are many other books out there for that, it was an entertaining, realistic read."
5,The Best on the Topic,"Once we found out that my wife was pregnant we went out and got an arm full of books and this was one of them. This book was by far both my wife's and my favorite of all the pregnancy books we bought. We both thought it was full of very helpful and interesting information that she wanted or needed. You really understand what is going on each week with the development of the baby. It also provides a great deal of pictures and illustrations. It is just an all around very useful book that has a lot of humor. My wife said it was the ""inside story"" on what she really needs to know. We recommend this book to all of our friends."
3,great gift idea,"Good Book for a newly pregnant mom to be, but took way to long to recieve this item, didn'tget the book til weeks after ordering, but was billed immediately"
