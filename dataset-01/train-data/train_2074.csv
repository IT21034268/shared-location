3,El mensajero y su Mensaje,Leí este libro cuando iniciaba el ministerio de pastorado y me sirvió en gran manera. Es muy fácil de entender. Comunica los principios de la predicación de una manera sencilla y completa.
5,best band ever,this band is inspiring with an upbeat tempo you cant help but love after 5 years i can still press play sit back and let the music take you away. you wont regret buying this cd cadet is awesomenessmusic is reminiscent of relient k and the offspringcadet pwnes all else
2,kind of bland,"I see the many glowing reviews of this album and wonder if I missed something. However, I can't like this album. I've listened to it many times, and there are a few good songs (""Nobody"" and ""Blame"" are the best, unfortunately they're also the first two songs) but no matter how much I listen I don't like this album. Many of the songs are kind of bland, uninventive both musically and lyrically, and run far too long. Maybe you like that sort of thing. I would listen to a friend's copy or a demo at the store first to make sure it's your kind of album before you buy. As for me, this is definitely *not* my kind of album."
1,Not what I expected!,My daughter was looking for dinosaur eggs that would hatch...specifically T Rex. I thought the photo was showing what it looked like once it hatched. Disappointed! Not a fun toy.
4,Some of Miles' Best Playing,"Yes, this set gets a little repetitive. But I like it because 1) the studio sessions are gorgeous, a continuation of the ideas laid down on ""Kind of Blue"", 2) it actually is interesting to compare Coleman and Rivers and Shorter, and 3) this is some of Mile's best playing, studio or live. He is inspired by the new band, and he is on FIRE."
5,Nerf does it again!,"I have two boys; 8 & 10. We play with these things all the time!!! We have a great time with this toy. Can't give it much of an educational rating, unless of course you live in a tactical environment...we do! LOL! If you have boys, this will get their wiggles out...don't forget the eye protection. BATTLE-ON!"
5,Fun for all ages,"When the kids and I play Nerf guns, the darts go flying everywhere, so extra ammo is essential to keep up with everyone. Comes with a handy mesh carrying case with a clip that will attach to your belt loop so your hands are free to aim for your target. The velcro darts tend to stick to the inside of the bag, but that's a minor annoyance for the amount of fun they bring. The name Nerf says it all!"
2,Below Average Video Quality,"This could have been good, however the video quality itself is substandard. It almost looks like it was produced on a cheap home video camera. Throughout the routine there are flashes of overexposure that are very distracting. There is a constant flickering light, similar to what would be produced with firelight, on both of the actors which I also find distracting. If these were intentional lighting effects, then it was poor production design to include them. The workout postures presented, at least to me, are fresh and different from other videos I have used, which I liked. I would rate this product as below average solely because of the quality of the video."
1,Save your money,"Don't be fooled by the title of this book or even the description under ""Editorial Reviews"" above. There's no knife fighting instruction to be found on its pages; instead, you get to see countless pictures of the author with well-known teachers of the bladed arts (as in ""look how well-connected I am""). A better buy would be Michael Janich's ""Knife Fighting: A Practical Course"", or Hochheim's ""Knife Fighting Encyclopedia""."
3,"Excellent design, poor in contents","This book has a lot of interesting photos, but lacks in real techiniques or traning hints (the traning target construction apart). The author explains only few basis and some philosophy of the knife fighter. By the way i suggest this book to whom are really beginner in knife fighting."
1,avoid it ; a loss of money,"A wrong jacket , the book is a pity in informations on combat knifes fighta lot of pictures of knife fight master ; a good solution to contact themfor to subcribe some money training sessions"
1,Just look at the cover LOL,"If your wanting a good laugh then purchase this book, the author seems more concerned about self promotion than actually writing about knife fighting. Horrible book"
3,Super Reader,"A fire demon starts a cult to do his dirty work for him, he gives people what they want, but forces them to choose a mark for him to take the life of.Doyle literally runs into a girl that is involved, and a vision has shown him more. A friend of Detective Kate Lockely is trying on the investigation thing to hide her involvement.Fun scene at the end, with Angel Investigations and a bunch of fire extinguishers directed demonside : ""Now I know what a Ghostbuster feels like,"" Cordelia said."
4,I love this CD!,Never heard of these cats until I found them browsing on Amazon.com. Downloaded this CD to my iPOD and listen to it all the time. I wish they were still around.
5,the real deal,"beginning to end this is one of the finest, no, it is the finest blues recording ever...pure musical magic...buy it now, you'll be glad you did."
1,For today's standards unacceptable sound quality,"The music is excellent, a true classic. The question is: Why doesn't get the sound treatment it deserves. It sounds flat, muddy, airless. Magic's yells are covered with distortion. A major crime. It's very difficult to hear, in these days of improvement of the 24-bit technology (I have just listened to the recent beatles remasters), such a poor sound. I've just bought it and will listen to it probably only once. One star."
5,Wicked Picking,"West Side Soul is the definitive album by one of blues music's greatest guitarists and singers. Magic Sam (nee Samuel Maghett) had a booming soul-singer's voice, with a touch of aggressive blues-style delivery (think of an irate Otis Redding, or Screaming Jay Hawkins), which set him apart from other blues singers. He sounds like he means it when he says ""you tend to your business, and I'll tend to mine"" in the classic ""I Don't Want No Woman."" But what really puts him on the map, in my opinion, is his outstanding guitar work. His version of ""Sweet Home Chicago"" is the definitive one, and his picking on ""I Need You So Bad"" is some of the best blues guitar of all time. Definitely worthy of any music collection."
1,This stupid disc costs too much!!,The cd costs too damn much! I'm not going to buy it until the price comes down. You've got to be out of your minds if you hope that I pay 30 bucks for this cd. It ain't gonna happen.
1,"Sent with no package, no instructions, no nothing.","Some products don't need a box or instructions. A hammer, for example, or per haps a pair of salad tongs. But anything used to calibrate a diabetic measuring device, in fact anything to do with medical instruments, should have both good packaging and very clear instructions. My order of the Freestyle Glucose Control solution arrived in a little ziploc bag (see photo) that was thrown in the box with another item I ordered. That's it, just two vials in a bag. No packaging whatsoever, no instructions at all, nothing that would indicate that this is really the product described here.That's not just unacceptable, it's borderline criminal. The receipt shows it as being sold by ""mdk ventures llc"" , and the product page says ""Sold by Medical Department Stores and Fulfilled by Amazon"", not sure of those are one and the same. But either way, this is grossly negligent and should be avoided. Don't mess with your (or in my case, my diabetic cat's) health."
5,perfect dreamy pop,"If you take the mastermind behind Starflyer 59 and add his wife on vocals, this is the outstanding result that you get. Bon Voyage play a dream pop with surf guitars and mild electronic beats, each song is very relaxed and seems to drift upward to the heavens. Julie Martin's voice is angelic and adds a Harriet Wheeler like quality to each track. If you are a big fan of the Sundays or Six Pence None the Richer, you will love this. This is an album that should be put on late at night or on a summer day's drive. The guitar is outstanding as well, it sounds like Starflyer 59 and that is never a bad thing."
5,Not lost any more,"This is a great product. I love having it in my car. I have a job where I am on the go all the time making house calls. I eat on the run and this device allows me to always find the closest resturants, and gas stations with it's ""Nearest point of intrest"" feature. My only complaints are that with new locations it won't register, and that it will occassionally freeze up for a short time, but will usally recover pretty quickly. I totally love their ETA feature, I use this all the time so that I know if I am going to be late or have time to make a quick stop. I would highy recommend this device to anyone and even got one for my dad for Christmas, he travels alot for work too and was really happy with it. It is also really user freindly right out of the box, I never even read the directions just put it in my car and went.Happy Driving."
3,OK for an older design.,"I have had this GPS for a year +. If your looking for a unit that has MP3, Blue tooth, LCD TV, etc. this is not the one for you. It does it's job reasonably well, that is: Driving instructions, keeps you from getting too lost, and when you do, it brings you back to where you should be. On the not so good side: the interface is not very intuitive. You really need to read and digest the 73 page manual. Also the maps are out of date, and can cause some problems. (I generally print a map from Google or Yahoo as a back up. I have yet to find an update for the map problem. The voice is weak when in your car at 70mph. On a big plus side, the voice will tell you what lane to be in when you are on a multiple interstate interchange. I am purchasing a new Magellan unit as my primary GPS. Their map sources are better."
5,Pure Montovani,"Very nice Christmas music done in Montovani's rich flowing style. There are some vocals, but the Montovani tone still shines through."
4,Nice looking birdbath,Bought as a gift and the recipient loves it - Says it looks great in his garden and is a good weight - no tipping problems or need to weigh it down like others reported.
5,Great learning tool,"I bought a gameboy before my daughter turned 2 hoping to keep her busy on a long plane ride. She enjoyed just pushing the buttons at that point and it kept her entertained for short periods of time. Now she is almost 2 1/2 and has mastered each and every Blues Clues Game and begs to play it every night before bedtime. It teaches the alphabet, motor skills, and memory. She can remember ""hidden"" letters better than my husband and I! She is very proud that she knows how to play the games, and loves to teach us adults how to play!"
3,Blue,"My two year old son is obsessed with Blue's Clues. So dumb that they don't just sell Blue's Clues stuff at the store, since it's still very popular...guess they don't want to make money. Anyways, the game is great for little ones. He could actually play it. A little outdated because of the gaming system, but works great for toddlers."
4,Read Between The Lines People!,"O.K., I know that many Mamet fans were disapointed with this one but I, for one, wasn't. This was actually the first Mamet play that I was introduced to (Before then I didn't even know that David Mamet existed) and I absolutly loved it, after reading it a few times. Yes, at first the dialouge (SP?) seems rather bland but, as my title says, you need to read between the lines! Use your imagination! There is something powerful about this piece because of all the underlaying tension. So read it! If you're patient, that is."
2,yawn....,"For a Mamet play, this one sure was a let-down. The play deals with the relationship between two actors - one older and one younger. Occasionally the dialogue between the two is mildly interesting, but more often than not it is tedious and boring. The scenes are short and virtually interchangable with no real depth of character. If you've read one exchange between the characters, you've basically read them all. Only a Mamet fanatic would truly enjoy this work."
3,Mark of Kri was better,"This game was alright, but I believe Mark of Kri was a better. I enjoyed it a bit more than this game."
5,the rise of the kasai,"Oh my God, if you have played ""The Mark Of Kri"" and you loved it! you are going to like this one even better, Very good experience with seller, the item arrived on time, no scratches, no damage, no problems at all, get yours with this seller, trust worthy, great experience, thanks amazon, thank you seller. bye"
3,the game kept freezing,"The game kept freezing at the end of the second or third level, i bought the game brand new from a marketplace seller so im not sure if that has anything to do with it but i looked at the disc and it had no scracthes i used a lens cleaning cd on the ps2 and wiped the video game with a soft cloth but it still kept freezing, i played other video games and i dont have this problem with any other games."
1,horrible,"i bought this game, the sequil to the mark of kri, but they sent me the mark of kri, very upset"
5,Excellent tire,"These are great tires. I rode on the BP MS150 and the preliminary training ridescwhere some of the back country road surfaces were hard on convetional bike tires; other folks had problems with flats, not me, the Marathons are still going good and I'll be able to ride again this year with the same tires."
4,"tough (against punctures, and to put on)","SUPER STIFF tire. If you're not very experienced in tire installation, you'll learn a thing or two with these. As others have noted elsewhere, they sometimes have problems w/ slipping on older rims at pressures above 80psi or so (even w/ a lip on the rim). Once on, though, they seem relatively bulletproof. For someone who rides on glass-ridden urban streets daily, these have so far done their job swimmingly."
2,Disappointed,"I agree with that these tires are almost bullet proof. I've had two flats; both caused by serious road debris. One flat resulted from an industrial size staple and the other from a 4"" steel spike. Durability is excellent. Unfortunately, both tires have blown off the rim thereby negating their positive features. The first blowoff occurred about 50 miles after the tire was inflated. This was the first time a tire has blown off the rim in about 20,000 mile of riding. The second blowff occured after a moving van driver (I recently moved from Northern to Southern California) deflated the tire. While inflating the tire, it blew off. I very carefully reseated the tire and rode about 100 miles. The tire then lost pressure due to a loose valve core. While carefully inflating, the tube poked out from under the tire. I'm now riding Vittoria randonneur tires with no difficulty."
1,Don't bother,"Don't bother buying these if they are for a road bike (25's), will not fit, broke every tire lever I had trying to get them on."
3,Difficult install!,"These look to be sturdy tires with a lot of protection, but the thickness of the extra rubber makes them *VERY* hard to install. I'm no stranger to mounting tires, but these took forever on my skinny rims.I'm actually doing an A/B comparison between these and some Vittorias, so I have one of these on the front and a Vittoria on the back. Vittoria, I can install in minutes; same with other brands of puncture-resistant tires in minutes. This Schwalbe took me about an hour; I needed to enlist my wife's help and use every tire lever I own.I hope it lives up to its durability claims, because I'm *really* not looking forward to prying this thing off, patching or replacing a tube, and getting it back on again."
2,Cannot be 25c,"I ordered the 700x25c as a replacement for my 23c tires. I had a incredibly hard time getting them on, and ended up bringing them to a bike shop for their help. They too gave up, and told me that these are far too large for 25c tires (which I would have to agree with).I ended up getting a different tire (also 25c) that I was able to put on at home with no issue. If you are coming from a road bike wheel, these are not for you! if you have wider commuter wheels, these should be ok."
4,Mushy ride,Based on other reviews I was worried about getting these mounted but it was not a problem for me. What I have noticed in the first 50 miles is that the ride feels different than previous tires I have used. They are fine going straight but seem mushy in a turn. I am not sure if it is the hard rubber of the tread or the special puncture belt but I hope I will get used to it after a few hundred miles. If the ride does not improve over time I will swap them out in the spring and use these as winter tires in the future.
4,Unbelievable sturdy,This tyre is great once you succeed in getting it on your rim. Punctured two tubes trying. Got one on but ran out of time with other. My son took it to a shop and listened to the mechanic cussing Schwalbe tyres as he also blew a tube putting it on. That said it is without a doubt the sturdiest tyre you can get. Short of running through a road made of barbed wire this thing is indestructible. I would highly recommend these tyres but take them to a shop and buy the tubes there.
4,Champions: Return to Arms,"Pretty much the same as the original Champions of Norrath, but with a few diffent characters to choose from. You can also import characters from the original Champions. Cool graphics and cool new villains.If you like the original, you'll like Return to Arms."
2,Mediocre Rehash of CoN: Realms of Everquest,"I liked the prequel ""Champions of Norrath - Realms of Everquest"" and was looking forward to an innovative sequel in the ""Return to Arms"". I was very disappointed to see that there is very little that's new in this version. Except for the two ""new"" characters, the characters look EXACTLY the same as before, with the same spells and abilities. The much-hyped ""total camera control"" amounts to false advertising, in that it allows a very slight zoom and that is all. There is NO visible improvement or innovative new feature at all. This game is showing its age, and there are plenty of better alternatives out there, like ""Ratchet and Clank - Going Commando"" and ""Dynasty Warriors 4"", both available for under $20. Skip the overpriced and overhyped ""Return to Arms""."
2,I'll be brief...,"because I don't want to waste too much more time on this game. If you've played Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance you've played this one. There's a slight variation in the gear you can buy, but if what you want is shopping head for the mall. The one selling point is the 2-player aspect, but both myself and my co-player got bored half way through, and the game's been sitting on the shelf ever since. In my book if a game's not making me want to call in sick, it's not doing it's job. Cheers."
2,The same old thing,"Champions of Norrath, fun game with an interesting story to it; Return to Arms, it feels like the same exact game as the first one (same attacks, no new customizations *oh, wait...ONE NEW hairstyle*, and the missions feel empty compared to Norrath). I find it hard to believe that so many people find the sequel (if you can call it that) ""refreshing"", unless you haven't played Norrath. It seems that they grew lazy with this one and frankly, I feel like I've been cheated out of $25 bucks (I'm just glad I didn't spend over $30 for this game)."
3,Not what was expected,"If this is your first Everquest Experience then this might not be to bad, but for hardcore EQ players its basicly the same game as the first just different quests and areas. The only thing really new is two more choices for a character, and u dont even get to choose gender for them. The two new ones are an Iksar Shaman and a Vashire berserker. The shama is like a mixture of a caster and fighter but more of a caster. The vashire is a potion user so buy lots and lots of healing potions because they get hurt like a caster, but they hit like a warrior. They recomend that you put points into his throwin axe skills, but if the bosses deflect 3/4 of the throwing weapons then its basiclly a useless abilaty. Its still a pretty good game and defenitly worth buying and playin for the hardcore players and those new to EQ. And sorry for not going into to much detail, I 'am just not into writing right now. I guess I should have just waited."
1,never got the game!!!!!!!,"i ordered this game in the beninnging of march and never revieved it. I got the run around twice when calling ""customer service"" but was finally told I will be issued a refund...I'm not going to hold my breath for that either. I am very unhappy with Amazon for the way they handeled my order and the problems that came up from the order....so now after over a month of waiting, I don't have my game and whether or not I'm getting my money back is still up for debate.Thank you for your time.Jennifer Almasi"
3,"A good game, but a joke if you were expecting a sequel.","I rushed out like others who had played the first Champions game to get this one...only to be disappointed in the extreme. Re-used graphics, re-used npc characters, re-used music, and re-used glitches from the first game!!!This game feels like outtakes from the last one and could have easily been released last year as ""Champions of Norath : Realms of Everquest Uncut"". If Sony was going to hold on to it that long I would have hoped that they could have at -least- improved it or even fixed the glitches. All I see is a -slightly- revamped game with a -few- new things (including new glitches!) and an even weaker story line!!All that being said, the game is still fun for online play, but after playing the first one this game lacks any freshness whatsoever in the single player story.Come on Sony! Stop picking our pockets!!"
3,Get ready to hack.,"I enjoy playing action ""hacknslash"" rpgs and the new Champions game will fulfill your desire to kill and level up. One thing not to expect from Champions: RTA is a deep story or anything remotely original that you haven't seen before. This game is pretty much like an expansion of Champions of Norrath. Would really be nice to see someone do something new in this genre but Champions: RTA doesn't. The biggest plus of the game is you can transfer your leveled up character out of Champions of Norrath and load it on to the new game, I ended up with a level 49 Wood Elf which was cool. A few new character classes thrown in, a good addition. Online play is really one of the best parts, get online with other people and go tear up some dungeons. So if you're undecided about this game and ya like Champions ofNorrath or Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance I & II, go pick it up. If not go pick up Shadow Hearts: Covenant."
3,Great Game for ps2 and ps3,Despite the few bugs the game does have...overall i find the graphics and the gameplay to be enjoyable...only down side is the fact you cant use your offline charaters in the online mode to play normal but its really a neat game as well is its predecessor Champions of Norrath.
4,Great Game,The game came before they specified in great condition. Playing the game is enjoyable and much different than the first of the series Champions of Norrath. Good charactors and just overall good time.
4,Here it comes..!,"I have the original, this one comes out 2/11/05can import original characters, another skill level, new charsgoes up to 80 now (up from 50) with an appropriate new difficultybasically a lion beserker and a lizard shaman (vanshir, iksar)original a lot of fun co-op, solo allows zoom-in (not great for fighting tho but getting a closer look)runs a little hard on older playstation2s, not sure if that will continue, newer ones should have little/no issueprobably get it day of/close to release!"
4,cool,"This Game is Pretty awesome you can upgrade your character's armor, weapon and powers. I haven't played the first game of the series but this one is good. also there are two more species of creatures to be ( Vah Shir Berserker and Some kind of Shaman) all in all its a good game."
4,Interesting gift,This is something my son had an interest in. I bought it for him as a gift. Now he can play itwhenever he chooses to because his friends come over alot.
4,1st timers,"This game is Great for 1st time players. Level 1 is really Simply all the child needs to do is push one button (the arrow) and the game does everything (it may seem really easy and quit dumb to very experience video game players) But on level 1 my son learn how to use the arrow button to walk once he master that then on level 2 he learned how to use the arrow & x button to jump. Then on level 3 & 4 takes more work moving, jump searching and by playing the level (not jumping right to 4) and he is getting better at the controls and can now operate games he couldn't before."
2,I would never buy this again...,"i read mixed reviews on here, but my little girl loves dragon tales so much that i purchased the game and hoped for the best. boy was i sorry. i despise this game. all the complaints people made in the previous reviews are correct, and then some. my little girl is 5 and she gets so frustrated with the game she will hardly play it. she won't play it at all without me there. she loves dragon tales so she keeps wanting to give it a try, but only gets frustrated time and time again. i hate this game. i do not recommend it to anyone, even little die hard dragon tale fans will be annoyed with it. TERRIBLE!!"
3,dragon tales down falls,The video game is very colorful and the voices are the same that you would hear on the t.v. show and it provides learning skills to your child or children which is a good thing but the real down fall of the game is. It is to simple your child will win this game in just 1 hour it is a very short game and also the game gets stuck at times and it skips over the voices to needless to say if you are looking for a game that is for a very young child in the age range of 3-4 years old this is the game for you.You can really teach your kids shapes and colors but only with your help this can be done my child didn't know a square from a circle but now he does and it took just 1 hour for him to learn this and i am very proud of him and i say thanks to the makers of this game so if your child needs to learn his or her shapes or colors please get this game for them you will love yourself for it later.
5,Top of the Heap,"This tarp was exactly as described and is sturdier than I had thought, I used it to cover my outside table and it fit perfectly, I will be ordering another for my cord of wood that I have in the back of my house to keep dry throughout the winter."
1,Very lightweight. Trashed after one use.,"I took a gamble on this tarp, and lost. The product description was poor- and I knew it was not '5 millimeters' thick when I ordered it- but this tarp was poorer quality than the $5 tarps at he local hardware store, tore on it's first use as a load cover, and was left at the dump with the trash. Don't waste money buying this glorified trash bag.Spend a little more on the 6 Ft. X 8 Ft. Super Heavy Duty 8 Oz. Brown Tarp - 16 Mil Thick and get one that lasts."
4,bulky but useful,"I bought this case immediately after buying my treo 650. It's a little bulky -- and takes some space under your jacket, but it holds the treo nicely, and looks good. I was dumb enough to buy it at a store for thirty bucks, so at the current amazon price, it's a great deal."
2,more trouble than it's worth,"This case looked good and seemed like a good buy until I realized that putting the phone in and out of the case turns the ringer off on the phone. You have to take the phone out of the case to answer it or to use it, so you end up taking the phone in and out of the case constantly. After I missed a few calls, I realized that taking the phone out of the case accidentally turns the ringer off because the case is so snug. Often, I forget to check the ringer and miss calls. Now, I basically don't use this case even though I have had it for less than a month. Buy one of the form-fitted cases instead."
5,"Finally, a great case for the Treo 650!","This is the third case I tried for my Treo 650, and it's simplicity is it's key to success. My first case had a flapping piece of leather that cost $35 and was totally useless. My second ""skin"" had a belt clip that whenever I bent over (to tie my shoes, for example) the phone would disengage from the clip and fall on the floor! Simply bad design.This well designed Premium Side Case is easy to use, easy to wear and gives excellent protection. When the phone is in vibrate mode, you are always aware when you get a call, page or email. It's small enough that it's not a problem when worn with a suit, and sits in the right place when driving with a seat belt. Good design is always fashionable and the case is well made. I wish it came in brown, I'd buy a second!So if you're looking for the right case... this is it. You will not be disappointed."
3,palmOne Treo 600/650 Premium Side Case,"The belt clip is very secure and the Treo is easy to get in and out of the case, even with the buckling strap. The case is very protective but the bulk of the thick leather is too much for me. I'm looking to get the thinner plastic belt clip that one of my coworkers has. It's much easier to wear."
5,"Nice, simple, and works","I tried one of the Seidio shield holsters but it kept falling off my belt when I got in and out of my car. The clip just wouldn't grip my belt securely enough. I gave up after the 3rd time my Treo 650 hit the concrete. Most of the time I just slip the thing in my left pocket, but that doesn't work so well with some pants - especially jeans.I decided to try the Treo leather case and I like it quite a bit. The clip is strong and I find it easy to get the phone in and out of the case."
1,bait and switch!,"I used to have one of these and loved it till it finally wore out. This was listed as the same as the one I bought before, but they downgraded the product and sold it under the same name. It's also not the one in the picture (note there is no embossed logo). It used to be decent leather and now it's more like cardboard. Not worth it!"
4,Is no the product of the photo,The photo of this Premiun Side case is not at the Photo. The side case in the photo have a Treo Logo and the producto don't have it
4,Good Case,This case does what it is supposed to do... it protects your palm treo phone. It is very nice looking and durable. The only negative comment that I will make about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snug fit. That is why I gave it a 4/5. Amazon has the best price for the case and it is well worth the price.
5,Palm Treo 640 side case,The process and price was perfect. Amazon had exactly what I was looking for and able to ship in the time frame I needed. The price was 44% than the brick & mortar stores.
5,The best,"It is great! you have to buy it, believe me. Don't waste your time looking for another case, this is the best."
4,Looks fine,"This product looks fine. However, I have purchased several of them and at times the bottom has a crack or the lid. They definitely are not as sturdy anymore as the old Rubbermaid items."
2,OVERCOMING NIGHT EATING SYNDROME: MY REVIEW,"Easy read but only somewhat more informative than the plethora of webpages on the topic. As I read through the book I found out a lot about symptoms and that I wasn't very unique in this problem. However, I didn't find any major insights by the way of a solution to the problem. The disorder is too recently recognized to have a lot of useful information about it. I just lock up the food at night."
4,Simple Book About Understanding And Overcoming NES,"****This is a simple, but thorough book about Night Eating Syndrome, a quick read (only 167 pages), but full of information. It starts out with assistance in evaluating if you have NES...however, I think that this book would be helpful to anyone who overeats at night, whether or not they fit all of the criteria for NES.It includes chapters on how to rule out other eating disorders and physical disorders, the biology and psychology behind night eating, hormonal involvement in night eating, types of night and eating and suggestions/plans for overcoming each. The interventions are pretty predictable, but still helpful, including journaling, imagery, relaxation, and other behavioral interventions. Support, medications, perseverance, and Internet resources are also discussed.All in all I thought it was a fine, easy to understand book about a little-discussed disorder just now coming to public attention.****"
5,Outstanding book on an obscure subject,"The P-39 was one of the more obscure USAAF fighters of World War II. It was used in secondary theaters and as a trainer by the USAAF, rejected by the RAF and greatly loved by the Soviet air force, who received thousands via Lend Lease.This compact volume has a tremendous amount of detail. It profiles the aces who flew the P-39, gives information about their wartime activities, aircraft and units, and includes several pages of beautiful color plates of the P-39 aircraft flown by aces. It will be a worthy addition to the library of aviation and military history buffs and builders of scale model aircraft."
1,This book is not about the airplane,"As a regular reader of 'Wings/Airpower', I found this book completely & absolutely NOT WORTHWHILE. There may be about 3-4 paragraphs about the actual airplane, but the ENTIRE rest of the book deals with ""in late Oct. '44, the 3rd Russian squadron of the 5th Ukrainian Airforce changed it's squadron designation to the 18th Russian squadron"".Here are some obvious questions that are NOT answered in the book . . .1. How did it compare in low-level fighting agaist Zero's? FW-190's? Me-109's?2. What good qualities did this maligned airplane have that the Russians could trounce FW-190's & Me-109's at low level.Why aren't there any interviews with pilots? ? ? ?-If you want a book about paint schemes, it's OK. If you want a book about the Airplane itself, this isn't it."
5,Best Osprey Aircraft of the Aces book about Soviet pilots,"Very good book: contains iformative text, rare photos and perfect profiles. Part about Soviet pilots and regiments is excellent. George Mellinger studied most Russian publications about P-39 in VVS. Book has only one disadvantage - extreme thinness."
5,Must have it!,"This CD is a must have for anyone who loves traditional Christmas music with a fresh approach. It is definitely my favorite Christmas CD, and I have given a copy to family and friends each year, all of whom love it instantly as well. Vince is an incredible talent and his range on the Native American flute AS WELL AS the saxophone is beautiful. You will be captivated."
2,Very irritating,"I thought I would really like this CD, as I have other Native American music CDs, but found it extremely irritating. The flute is just too screechy."
4,"Will know as soon as I can use, but seems great.","It, as well as the high grade sanding papers I bought with it for beginning to bring my '06 Tundra back to spec looks, seem good for the needs I have to smooth down the rough spots/gouges"
2,Great book-- sad angel policy,"I am an avid stamper, and PSX used to be the grand dame until I read their demonic angel policy. They are pretty tight with their stamps and what you can do with them and go beyond the, ""Just-make-sure-you-hand-stamp-as-opposed-to- reproducing-our-images"" policy of other firms. It is hard to sell your work and you can't really donate it to an auction without prior approval. If you enjoy stamping, look into other firms like Magneta or Mirkwood for their stamps and READ THE ANGEL POLICY (limited angel policy is a warning to run!) but definitely buy this book."
1,wasted money.,"did not take charge. I think I was ""hook-winked"" with another old battery.Is there no way to ascertain if you are receiving a new battery?"
5,No problems...,"Very fast service, battery itself worked, no problems nor issues....I was a bit concerned when I first ordered it because the numbers on the back of the battery did not match then one I had, but everything is fine."
5,Good replacement battery,"After many years of use, I need a new battery for my Palm Treo 650, this was really good indeed."
5,Suitable replacement when your Treo battery finally dies,"The battery I received is a Sanyo lithium battery, made in China, with a label that specified it is a replacement for the orginal Palm Treo battery, which wears out eventually. (That's why it's replacable -- Steve Jobs please take note!) The battery holds a charge well, fully the equal of the original one that came in the Treo.Sometimes you see ugly reviews about aftermarket batteries that blow up or don't hold a charge or cause high fevers and chills, but I've never had bad experience -- not with this one or with two aftermarket batteries for my Canon digital camera. Perhaps some of those stories are plants by the manufacturers who want you pay a lot more for their ""authorized"" replacements. In any case, this replacement for a Treo battery does exactly what's supposed to do."
1,Battery was not new; died after 45 days,"Battery was advertised as ""new."" Yet it arrived without manufacturer's packaging and had scratches on its cover. I assumed it was a used battery at that point. After 45 days, it overheated repeatedly. I disposed of it. Would not use this vendor again."
1,does not fit a 680,i believed this battery would fit my treo 680. it does not. dumped it. it would cost more to ship it back than it was worth.
1,Dead as a doornail,"I wish I could provide a review of how this product works. However, I received a completely dead battery. Not even a hint of a former life. I guess you get what you pay for...."
2,"low price, low quality","Great low price, must have been a used or recycled battery, doesn't hold a charge very long. Its getting me by, if you need your phone to last all day without a charge you are better off getting a new battery."
1,don't do it,ordered two batteries only received one. called they told me to go after the shipper. the package did not have quantity numberso i was out of my money. worst experience i have ever had on the net
1,Don't buy used batteries,These are evidently used batteries probably taken out of turned in phones. They are real Treo batteries but are not packeged. I could see fretting on the conatcts indicating that they had spent some time in another phone. The battery life is very poor relative to a new battery. No better than the worn out battery I was replacing. Selling used batteries would be OK if they were identified as such.TR
2,Did not fit (too thinck) my cell phone,"Although the numbers match, the battery was too fat. It did not fit in my cell phone. I cannot use it"
4,Treo 650 Replacement Battery,"Great price, excellent delivery. So far, excellent results- can't tell the difference between this battery and the original, so I assume it is a factory new, not a refurbed. I would give it 5 stars, but I've only had it 2-3 eeks and don't know how long it'll be before it doesn't hold a charge like the original one did..."
5,Excellent for the price,"A battery for under $10 for a phone that has a retail tag of about $300 is a STEAL! I'm not sure if this battery has longer life than the original OEM battery. I thought the original battery was only about 1500mAh or so, but they have the same part number.My Treo650 was getting to the point of needing a charge almost daily. Now, it goes about 3 days on a charge. Not bad for power-sucking Treo."
3,palm battery not new,"Battery was not in stock. Battery was not new but older. Shipment was not on time. Vendor offered refund or replacement, ask for refund but merchant has not followed through yet. If you truly want Brand new battery email seller and specify new only factory sealed. Batteries may hold charge and may be good for some purposes at cheap price. I won't / can't resell to my customers as new as I know the difference between new and used or lightly used and older. Buy at your own risk from this merchant. (Recent developments) Seller has apologized and finally authorized amazon to issue refund."
3,Buena bateria,Es un buena opcion para aquellos que tienen problemas con sus baterias. Tengo un Treo 650 y la bateria me funciona perfectamente bien.
3,Treo battery replacement,"I'm fairly happy with the Treo- although have had a few snafu with it. It was a major purchase for me & was sort of put off by having some of the manufacturing problems that I have encountered, early battery replacement being only one of them"
4,"Good ""review""","I used this book in my Italian III class in college. It was good for reviewing my verbs which is essential in learning this language. It's pretty good for testing yourself, and you can review your work every now and again for a refresher. Learning any language is all about practice, this is an additional helper."
5,Great Verb Drills Workbook,"This workbook helps a lot with explaining verb conjugations while also giving you a lot of practice! If you are having a hard time remembering conjugations and getting the hang of verbs in the Italian language, I would highly recommend this book. Also the price is hard to beat!"
1,Cord Cutters: This isn't why you cut the cord,"Wow, this is so incredibly cliche...and boring. Yes, I'm a dude, so I'm probably not the target viewer. But regardless, stay away from this brain-sapping drivel, even if you get the first episode for free. Your TIME is worth a lot more than 'free.' BTW, my definition of cliche is: irreverent characters, voice insertion in babies, formerly unconventional (now conventional) camera angles, plot scenarios where the viewer knows more than the characters in the plot....yawn, yawn, yawn. I think 'Ally McBeal' had most of this shtick covered many years ago."
4,love this show,i love this show it makes me laugh and James Vender Beek does a great job making fun of himself
1,show ever,They work so hard to be funny and it doesn't work..I wanted to love it but couldn't......ABC can do better then this
5,A very entertaining read!,"I have no idea how, but Craig managed to make me genuinely care about the three amoral drifters at the center of this novel. They're some of the liveliest and most colorful characters that I've read in a long time. The tag lines and plot summaries don't do justice to this book--it's far more layered and complicated than the love-triangles and grifts that are described on the cover. Craig's noirish dialogue is spot-on; and the pace of the book is wonderful, especially considering that we watch Kevin, the lead character, grow from a nervous little boy to a neurotic but talented young man. I couldn't put it down."
4,A vicarious look at the shady side!,"Facinating view into the life of a con artist and family. Hot Plastic is an exciting, well written story with rich diverse characters. It's suspenseful and action packed with a few good love stories thrown in for good measure. It's easy to lose yourself in this book."
3,Plastic Spur Gear vs. Metal Spur Gear,"Very good product for the price, if it strip's out it was only a couple dollar's, no big loss for a very expensive hobby. Probably will be moving up to metal spur gear due to installing a much more powerfull motor ???"
3,Quick and Fun.,"You have to have a love for John Waters' ""Edie"". This is a short film. I was expecting a little more. It was interesting as it gives a quick view of Edith Massey. Documentary in style."
1,No way to hang off my changing table!,"I loved the Sage Jungle product line, but this product has a fatal flaw. There is no way to hang it off my changing table! Because of the design of my changing table, I need an external strap to hang it over one edge. But this stacker does not come with an external strap. So it is sitting unused in a closet."
1,wrecked first time use,My Wonder Mill wrecked the first 30 second I used it. Heated up and started jerking and smelled like burnt plastic. I purchased it a week ago from Hill's Mills & Mixers (Wonder Mill Distributor Canada) and they told me that the warranty changed from (Lifetime warranty) to no warranty after it wrecked. I had just purchased item a week ago and it advertised as lifetime warranty when I purchased it for $300.00. service is very bad. owner of Hill's Mills & Mixers did not help my situation didn't give me a new mill. I think If I purchased this item from amazon that would have been my best bet.
1,Disappointed with WonderMill,"This mill can definitely grind grains. That is not the problem. Unfortunately, the one I received has a defective switch. You have to flip the switch several times for it to come on. In order to get it fixed, I am having to send the grinder back to WonderMill at my expense and then send them an additional $20.00 to return it to me when it's fixed. All in all, I am having to add about $45 to the cost of this grinder. That brings the cost to over $300, a price I would have not ever considered paying for this grinder. I could understand this more so if I had had the grinder for a long time, but that is not the case. I buy many things on line and from time to time, there will be a problem but I have never had any other company require payment for them to return the product to me after they have fixed it when it was defective from the beginning. This has really caught me by surprise. I will be much more careful with online purchases from now on."
5,Great Mill:),"I make bread every other day for our family. This mill has worked great for us (so far)! We researched mills and chose this one because of the non-aluminum, non-stone grinding mechanism. The grinding mechanism is stainless steel. It is not too loud, my vacuum is louder. It is easy to clean. I just dust it off with a pastry brush. It takes less than 5 minutes to mill the flour I need.I have had only one issue with it so far, which was obviously user error. Be sure to snap the lid on the canister completely. I did not, and once it started the lid popped up and my counter was covered with flour.We are enjoying our fresh flour/bread daily! Fresh flour does make a HUGE difference."
1,It fell apart!,"I bought this product because I wanted to grind my own grains, obviously - specifically, chickpeas, because I make a lot of Indian food using chickpea flour. I have used this machine only once or twice a year, and each time I have used it to grind chickpeas, it has been less than enthusiastic (even though the instructions say it WILL grind chickpeas). But yesterday was a total disaster.....parts of the plastic body cracked and fell off!! This is for no reason at all, as this machine has barely been used and has never been mistreated. I am very upset because it cost so much money, and I am unaware of any other grinders out there to replace it with. I will try to make a video showing the body damage on this machine.I bought this mill from Amazon in 2008, and I plan to contact WonderMill, because the machine is still under warranty."
4,Enjoying my Wonder Mill Electric Mill,After careful review of all the grain mills I decided to go with the Wonder Mill. I've had it a month now and I really like it. The only problem I had with it so far was my fault. I didn't securily snap on the lid and got flour all over the place. A good lesson to remind me to check the lid next time I use it. I'd recommend this mill. It's affordable and works very well.
3,Wonder why they make these mills?,We had a Nutrimill for maybe three years. The electronics in it burned out several times and I got tired of fixing it. So I bought a Wondermill for my wife. These mills are all made cheap. I wonder why I bought it. Wondermill takes up twice the shelf space as the Nutrimill because the parts do not nest together--poor design guys! The container that collects the flour pops open if you just touch it and flour flies out. It's not actually loud unless there is no grain in it. My wife goes crazy because this mill is so 'touchy.' You can't turn it off or on with any grain in it. Is the no one who can design a mill better than these?
5,Very Pleased -- Very Loud,"Fantastic product, works well.grinds flour much finer than my prior KitchenAid attachment grill.Sounds somewhat like a jet engine when it starts up. In an appartment we can't use it at night.Love this mill."
5,Great grain mill,"I have used it only to grind wheat, and that works wonderfully. It grinds a full hopper in under a minute.When it runs when it's empty it is very loud, but gets quieter as soon as the grain hits the mill.Didn't see a big difference in coarseness between the bread or course setting, but haven't tried the pastry setting yet."
2,Loved it until it quit working!,"For two years I loved my mill. But a couple of weeks ago it quit working while grinding my wheat. I dumped all the wheat out, unclogged the tube that feeds into the canister and again started grinding my wheat. It stopped again, this time with a little smoke coming out of it. No matter what I do, it won't start up again. I used it between once and twice a month for about two years. I'd love another one if I knew it wouldn't break down! I just don't know if I want to put my money into something that might not last."
1,Mine quit working after the tenth time I used it.,"I would have rated this mill very highly if it had not broken after so very few uses. I'm so disappointed! I spent over $300 locally for this mill and now it won't work. (Naturally the store warranty is expired.) Also, I assure you I followed all the directions to properly operate the machine - so I don't think it is user error on my part.Update: I was going to go through the process of contacting the manufacturer, but amazingly it now works again! It wouldn't start for all of December, then when I tried it again in February (expecting nothing, really), lo and behold it works again. I don't know what happened or why. Anyway, I wanted to let others know about this turn of events so as to not prejudice anyone against this machine unneccessarily. So I'd update the stars to four if I were allowed. Not five because I didn't like that it stopped in December, but it works now, so I forgive it :)"
2,"The mystery DVD without details, now detailed...","I wasn't expecting much when purchasing this, but thought for $1.49 why not try this mystery item. The DVD comes in a slim-cardboard sleeve, not a regular DVD case, with the following three episodes on it:Case of the Eiffel TowerCase of the French InterpreterCase of Harry CrockerSound and video quality are quite poor, but again, given the price what can you really expect."
2,not the best choice in scope mounts,"I didn't receive the same mounts pictured. The ones I did receive wouldn't adiquitly hold the scope on magnum air rifle, had to end up returning them... Plus the mounts holding the scope so high was uncomfortable after a while of shooting."
2,Item Not as Described,"Buyers, please be aware that the item pictured is not the same model. The headset in the picture advertised is Plantronics headset CS361N, not CS520. Additionally, it is advertised as including a spare voice tube, alternative ear cushions, and removable comfort pad in the box; however, these items were not included in my order."
4,Worth ever penny,"I work from home and spend a good 8 hours a day on the phone. I kept getting complaints that people were having trouble hearing me on my 7 year old wired Plantronics headset, so I knew it was time to upgrade. I was a little hesitant to get a wireless headset, and to spend this much money, but it turned out to be a great choice. The clarity is terrific, with absolutely no static or noise. The mute and volume controls on the feather light headset come in very useful. This is a quality engineered and constructed product. In my home, the effective range through walls and other obstacles is about 100 feet."
2,"Beware, the don't appear to be New headsets.","I order a lot from Amazon, and I've never been disappointed until now. The first CS351N we ordered looked used. No plastic wrap around the base unit, or headset. Or any protective covering. The inside of the box that holds the base unit looked pretty beat up, and the headset foam was compressed on part of the ear. Called Amazon, and they quickly sent out a ""New"" unit and gave me a label to send the original back. Well, sorry to say that the 2nd unit looks the same as the first. So either I got another used headset, or the quality on these from Plantronics stinks. Not what I expect for $180. Buyer beware. Amazon are you listening?"
2,Headset crackles and interferes with calls,"I really don't care for this headset, purchased to replace a previous Plantronics wireless headset. Brief synopsis after using this for the past 6 months:Cons:- If you walk/move around, the headset frequently crackles and causes disturbance that the other person can hear- The ear piece is heavy/clunky and bothersome to wear if you are on the phone for a long timePros:- I like the ""remote"" handset lifter on the earpiece, but would sacrifice that for a more streamlined and lighter earpiece."
4,SupraPlus Wireless Professional Headset System,"I really like this wireless headset. I've been using a wired headset for years that worked extremely well but the coil cord got tangled on my keyboard drawer and many other things, and I occasional tripped over the cord. I no longer have any of these problems. The only problem I have with the wireless headset is I don't hear my voice very well when I speak.Other than that I think the product is great, I should have bought it years ago."
5,Fantastic Headset!,"We have been using this product in our reception/charting area for a few months no. It has been absolutely perfect. Don't forget to purchase the lifter in order to remotely answer/hang up calls. The wireless signal stregnth is outstanding. The employee using this headset, is actually able to the phone while out in our parking lot, or downstairs in the supply room. Honestly, it was worth the money."
3,Plantronic headset feedback,"When I use the headset, I hear a lot of echoing on my side and also have received complaints from people on the other side that they hear an echo. When I go on mute, people no longer hear the echo."
5,New look and lots of crazy,"Gideon cracks & leaves, new guy Rossi steps in to help, Garcia is shot, one of the best season-ending episodes and a whole lot of UnSubs inbetween. As much as I liked Gideon, Rossi brings in another vibe to the team, without upsetting anything and I liked that a lot. The season ender was creepy, and the ending minutes sent chills down my spine as the seconds ticked off."
4,great tv show,What can I say. A great TV show and a great dvd set. Lots of action and a cast that you bond with.
4,Criminnal Minds: The Complete Thhird Season,"This TV Series is awesome, every chapter is very good. The only thing against is not having spanish subtitle or any . Remember, the spanish market is a growing one."
5,Great present for fans,I got this as a mother's day gift. My mom watches the show and loves to watch them without bothersome commercials.
5,Awesome,This season is one of the best so far...you learn more about the characters...there is new romances...all in all it is amazing :)
5,Absolutely The Best Show Ever!,"This was another big hit with the granddaughters. They love the same shows as I do. Thanks Amazon for all the great gift ideas..everything arrived in great condition, too."
5,Love this show,"This show is amazing. My wife and I started watching this show late and needed to watch the DVD's from Netflix. But, for some reason at the time Netflix didn't have this season. And we needed our Criminal Minds fix, so we ordered it through Amazon and couldn't have been more satisfied. They showed up quick with no problems or defects."
5,Amazing Show,"Criminal Minds is one of my favorite shows on TV. I purchased Seasons 1 - 3 and downloaded them rather than trying to watch them on Amazon's Instant video.I have enjoyed watching the show from the beginning, episode by episode, and observing the metamorphosis of the characters and their relationships with each other.I plan on purchasing the remaining seasons and I know I will be just as happy with them as I am the first three seasons. (Although I have probably seen every episode that has been made at least 4 times already)!"
1,DVD cracked,"The Criminal Minds seasons are wonderful but in this set the last disk was cracked and it wouldn't run in our DVD so I ended up having to buy a whole other set just to see the last disk. I lost $42.00 but have learned not to order DVD's on line. There are no instructions on returning damaged items, or on refunds. So you're better off buying locally even if it costs a bit more."
4,Leave me a message ......,"Here is when a man's drawings come 2 life. Yet, he does not remember anything. He can not except the death of his girlfriend. Finds a way 2 get his revenge by becoming his own drawings."
4,criminal minds,i enjoy this show. After I watched it I thought that it was $1.99 well spent. I most likly will watch more epasodes on my kindle.
5,Constantly Amazed,I'm mid-way through season 3 and each episode is equal to the last even though i think at the time it's even better. I've felt that way since the Pilot. The story lines are equally surprising on L&O; SVU but Criminal Minds has a much more interactive human element to it. I didn't think I'd like a show applying psychology to pinpoint the killers but everything moves forward assertively to satisfying scenes and results.Criminal Minds is a serious show that's seriously excellent.
4,Can't stop the Carnage!,"This show just gets better and better. Even when actors leave the show (i.e. Mandy Patinkin), the other actors have the chops to pick up the slack. I love this show (all seasons) and hope they keep up the good work. Joe Montegna is playing a completely different character than Mandy Patinkin's character. And for real...did anyone really think that Mandy Patinkin would stay past two seasons?I have my favorite Characters in this show and they rock! Who can resist Garcia and her relationship with Morgan. And Dr. Reid with his I'm so smart that I'm clueless role. Love it!The Carnage that happens every week is an excellent backdrop for this ensemble!"
3,nice pictures but...,"note how small the book actually is! Don't expect a regualer sized colouring book, it's actually pocketbook sized!"
3,Too small for a 3-year-old,"I knew the booklet was small but thought it would still be a cute little activity for my almost-3-year-old grandson. However, the pages won't lie flat and he couldn't manage holding the booklet open and coloring at the same time. I won't buy these again."
2,Not full size,"I probably did not read the details closely enough, but this is a very small coloring book. Not what I expected."
4,ok,"These coloring books are not the hottest coloring books in my art consortium. I thought they would be ok for adults who thought the regular dover coloring books were too strenuous. Unless you have an animal lover, I would get the stained glass and other little dover coloring books. These are women ages 40-70."
2,The coloring book is about as small as this picture!!,"I did not apparently read the entire description. These are so small, they are about the size of a small pack of crayons!!!"
5,All you must know about perspective when painting with watercolor,"Incredible and easy way of learning about perspective in drawing, using color, value, shadows and composition. This book is a must for anyone wanting to improve his watercolor painting skills."
3,Nice graphics but to difficult for young players,"We bought this game for our four year old who just received a gameboy for christmas. The dragontale characters are one of her favorites. Her face lit up when she saw she could control Cassie, but when she started to play she got frustrated with the time limitation. The game is written for 3- 5 years old, but the time limitation giving to complete a level is not long enough for beginner gamers. My six year old tried to to show his sister that she just needed to practice, but even he is not able to advance past the six level. He has been a gameboy player for two years now and has become a gamer expert for his age. If he can't beat it, no three or four year old will be able to in my opinion. The nice thing is you can play the lower levels over and over and try to gather more berries with each try. My daughter still likes it because of the characters, but she doesn't play it very long."
2,Dragon Tales: Dragon Wings,My 5yr old got just got his first game boy and I thought that this would be perfect for him. How disappointed we were. I wish I had read the other reviews before we wasted our money on this one. It was very difficult to move around..and even I had trouble trying to get to the other levels. Please spend your money on something else.
3,"Cute, but too difficult for younger players","My 4 year old got this for Christmas and was thrilled when she seen it was Dragon Tales, but with the time limitation she is not able to play it. The game is very cute, but the easy level needs to have no time limit or the time limit needs to be longer. I even have a hard time."
1,"Poor Taste, and lost my appetite :-(","I too, purchased this book as a bargain and was quickly offended by the illustrations and word usuage. These are the sorts of things I want my children to understand ARE NOT FUNNY! The author makes light of some pretty terrible habits. I'm sure some families may feel it is appropriate, but my purchase was intended as a donation to our elementary school library. NO CAN DO! The theme is important, but I'm really not sure that the message here is a positive one. Unless of course, you consider teaching kids the worst manners a worthwhile lesson. This book should have been advertised with a message suggesting that some may be offended by the rawness of the language and naked illustrations."
5,Why Gravitys Rainbow is the bomb.,"Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon is the literary analasis of the parabola that simultaneously connects and seperates the binary opposites of life. This Parabola appears as a solid line, and indeed it is so as to offer a convenient model for descriptive purposes, yet the line is an infinite string of subatomic sigularities that refer to what they are not and represent what they are comprised of. That parabola is microcosmically shown in the life of Tyrone Slothrop, for he can never know his exact proximity, he can merely gauge his ditance to the closest 1 or 0."
4,to the person who called this novel a 'doorstop'...,"if you head to reviews 11-20 of GR on Amazon and look around thereabouts you'll find a review titled 'doorstop.' read it because it is as funny if not funnier than the novel itself and that is saying something. i think i had that person for intro to brit-lit freshman year. way to be born 'smarter' than me you douchebag.oh, and the book is pretty boring and pretty rad."
1,"Complete Shite, One Star Too Many...","I don't make a habit of stopping a book once I get into it. This book was just not worth my time; was only drawn into it by its great reviews. It was obviously written by some self-loving, over-indulged, hippie."
1,Obscure and Disjointed,"I've searched but I can't find the literary side of this book. Where are timeless themes, the affective characterizations? The book's a little like Finnegan's Wake -- too obscure, too 'over the top.' Excuse me, but the book doesn't make integral sense. This long tome is more a collection of random sentences and rambling paragraphs too often concluded with three (let's be honest) fatuous, trailing dots. No, GR is not literature -- it's more like a going out of business sale -- it's everything PLUS the kitchen sink. And beware: one needs a companion book to understand it 'fully'. This book's failings are in part a function of it's time -- the early 70's - when culture was naively experimental, half-baked, vulgar, and exhibitionist."
2,The strangest book I ever never finished reading,"I am very surprised to find this on a modern book list because I attempted to read it many years ago. At the time I thought I was a pretty avant-garde sort of reader, but I couldn't quite make it through the weirdness! Maybe I should try it again? NOT"
5,"Great, but not for the reasons some state","This book is a series of linked vignettes, that tell more of an imagined history focused on themes than a traditional novel. It is difficult, but not beyond the comprehension of a reasonably intelligent person paying attention on their first read. No guidebook or rereads necessary for enjoyment. It's also hilarious, bleak, uplifting, heart-wrenching and depressing. It is not, however, post-modern wankery indulging in style for its own sake or merely to indulge the reader in every absurd thing the author could think up. Every one of the vignettes carries with it something worth saying and worth thinking, tells a story worth reading that resolves into something worth feeling. Portions of this were so poignant I started crying."
5,GR altered my conceptions of what a novel should do.,"I fought tooth and nail through almost every page in this book, at a time in my life where I needed to be knocked out of a rut. It definitely did the trick! It made me re-evaluate my art(music), and to some extent my whole life. If you've read any other of Pynchon's novels, you owe it to yourself to tackle this bad boy. Not only is the writing style brilliant and witty, but the payoff of following the threads and working to catch the allusions is immense. When you're done, take a break then move on to ""V."" If you haven't read anything else by the Man, check out ""Crying of Lot 49"". A great intro. and a fun read."
4,Pynchon is good...but not as talented as Gaddis,"I want to make it very clear that I regard this novel as one of the best that America, in her short history, has offered to the world and history at large. But...I find it incredibly disappointing that Pynchon (even as talented as he is) has overshadowed an American novelist who has written what will likely be regarded in a hundred years time (and is already now in some circles) THE great American book. The book I am referring to is William Gaddis' ""The Recognitions."" If you have the intellectual interest and passion to get through ""GR"" then you will appreciate "" The Recognitions,"" for its rigor, intelligence, and curiosity"
1,Waste of Time,"This is not literature. Pynchon writes liberal, paranoid diatribes against any and all institutions, especially conservative ones. Pynchon certainly possesses the skills of a writer, but he lacks the discipline and creative drive of an artist. His wandering narrative style is meaningless - comparisons to works by Joyce are absurd. The further you delve into Pynchon's work to seek out deeper meaning the closer you come to realizing that there is no meaning - just variously colored blotches and stains, pasted together for shock effect. If you would like to try something intelligent that reads along similar lines, try Philip Dick, an under-appreciated 20th century American writer who possessed talent and vision superior to anything Pynchon could approach."
2,I'm sick to death of all the semantic insanity...,"So it sits there on my shelf, having defeated me twice. OK, maybe I'm a lazy bum, but I think I'm approaching the point where if another confused milquetoast hack tells me I *need* to read this book because TP is the best writer of the 20th century blah blah blah (a disgustingly de minimus claim) I'm going to go nuts."
3,"Not great, not bad either.","It does take awhile to get used to Pynchon's prose style (somewhat agrammatical). But once you get into the rhythm of his writing, you should be able to follow what's happening.What stands out the most in GR is definitely the characters, and in a sense, that's what GR is about. Sure, ideas abound as well, but they're secondary to the people here. Confused Slothrop (who, I felt, was unfairly dismissed at the end, but that may have been the point) sad Pokler (the situation with his daughter Ilse was the most touching part of GR), taciturn Morituri, gloomy Roger Mexico...Interesting, to say the least, but I wouldn't say great. I think Pynchon's revered prose style here is what detracted from the story. Faulkner it ain't."
4,Huh?,"Well, well.As I consider myself erudite, at some point in my life I knew I'd have to read this book. It's been on the shelf with Finnegan's Wake, Moby Dick and The Magic Mountain. Having finished the other 3 I had no remaining excuse.I still have no idea what it's 'about.' It frequently made me want to gouge my eyes out with a fork. I'm not sure if thats good or bad.Now I'm going to start reading Against the Day. Pray for me."
3,Feel Naked and Dead reading this.,"I first picked a copy of this book up when I was fifteen or so, as I was searching through my dad's library of books. Now I'm in college, an English major. Last semester, I was in a class devoted to Joyce; this semeser, a class devoted to Shakespeare. Neither professor felt a need to justify their respective subject's canonicity. But everyone I come across feels an overwhelming need to justify Pynchon's canonicity. Why? That for me is the problem with this book: is it so ponderous as to be an ostentatious piece of loquacity or is it a cogent discourse on the frailties of the human mind a la Ulysses, Portrait, Hamlet, Lear? The jury is out."
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"All the fuss is fascinating. Maybe all the academic hype has engendered an ""I'm cleverer than you"" backlash to get so many vituperative reviews.I think the book is fun. I first read Gravity's Rainbow around 1973 when it came out in paperback and was blown away by the story. I re-read it a few years later and confirmed my opinion of the book as a great read. I intend to re-read it again.It is certainly the most impressive contemporary work of fiction that I have read and deserves pride of place on the bookshelf. The characters are interesting and fun, the interconnected plot is intriguing, the imagery is profound, and the references are challenging. I recommend this to my friends and give it as gift whenever I can. Five stars do not seem enough."
2,Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow,"The book, as reviewers have noted, is almot unreadable, obscure, complex in stucture. It is important in the development, or decay, of the history of literature. I read on until early in the second part where there occurs the most revolting, obscene, and unnecessary chapter of anh book I know."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"A dense book, with the writer throwing a lot of stuff in. Presumably meant to be a literary fancy pants type of thing, but to me, that just made it incredibly dull and a slog to get anywhere near through much of it.Definitely not entertaining in the way Robert Anton Wilson is, for example."
4,"Excellent, but no Gaddis","Gravity's Rainbow is an excellent novel. Pynchon is one of the pre-eminent writers in American letters. So I encourage all who enjoyed GR to explore another novel: The Recognitions, by William Gaddis. If you still feel Pynchon is God, fair enough. But at least view the real competition, which has been concealed for far too long."
3,perhaps you just have some better options for how to spend a lot of time...,It's not that you're necessarily lazy...it's not that you didn't take the time to explore all the pop/cultural/literary/scientific/dream archetype references...it's not that you didn't re-read it three times...you probably just had something better to do...I did..but I finished it anyway..please don't feel bad if you don't...you just might be less stubborn than most of the rest of us
1,Worst Book Ever,I read about 30-40 books a year of all genres and this is by far the worst book I have ever read. It is the rambling of some intellectual who is just trying to impress you with obscure references or shock you with descriptions of degenerate acts. I forced myself (and it wasn't easy) to finish but it was torture. Don't waste a second of your time with even starting to try and read this paperweight.
1,AS FAR FETCHED AS WATCHING PAINT DRIES,"I'm sorry, I gave this book my ALL, since I am an independent bookseller,in my lifetime I've read many many MANY books,and this one was IMPOSSIBLE. It reminded me of James Joyce's babble, I couldn't keep my attention on it because of the babbling style of Jame's Joyce, but PLEASE do not DARE compare this nonsensical drivel the majestic prose of Dan DeLillo or my favorite author, David Foster Wallace. ""Gravity's Rainbow"" was a waste of my time, and I would NOT recommend this dreck to ANYONE!I would rather learn Mandarin Chinese."
1,Confusion's Dumpster,"I lived in Germany a few years ago and found this book in a train station. Someone had just walked off and left it. After about ten pages, realizing that Pynchon was an intellectual rip-off artist, I secured it a trash can where no one could find it. I like to think I protect the public from pollution."
1,Stunningly incomprehensible,"Thomas Pynchon has duped the entire literary world with this 800 page assortment of random words and phrases that at times come together in complete thoughts, most likely unintentionally. I can honestly say that I looked at each word, but I came away with no sense of having read a book here. My best assessment of this book's success is that there are a good handful of insecure literati-types who convinced themselves that any book too confusing to understand must be brilliant.The only reason I can give to read this book is to able to say that you have read this book."
5,The Mother of All War Novels,"If you have not experienced Pynchon before, getting ready to have your life taken over for a while. I bought this book when I was a freshman in college at the suggestion of my Political Science professor and, after several unsuccessful initial attempts, it remained unread for more than 25 years. Awhile back, I got sick of the thing sitting on my bookshelf mocking me and so I finally started and finished it, along with the aid of Weisenburger's ""A Gravity' Rainbow Companion"". (The fact that a 900-page novel requires a 300-page companion to explain all of the embedded allegories and allusions says a lot, but I'm not sure what exactly.) That this is the mother of all war novels is at once an accurate and highly misleading statement. The prose is both complex and lyrical, the images both beautiful and frightening. It was a ride unlike any other that I have taken."
3,This book tasted like peach fuzz,"I know this opening line makes no sense, but it does to me. THAT is what makes this book such a delightful headache. Pynchon knows what his references are suppose to mean, but doesn't seem to care if the rest of us are in on it. I kept finding myself saying to the book on my lap...""Yoo-hoo. Remember me? The reader?"" The words were in English, but when put togther like that you had to surrender logic and go by complete intuition. WHICH, IRONICALLY was the main premise as to what drove Slothrop on is dreamlike quest to find his deep love - the V2 rocket. I'm glad I read it, but I don't know if I could recommend it to anyone who isn't on an eternal quest to discover what all the world has to offer."
5,Life-changing,"Read it once, twice, three times. Devote a life to its study, for the story, the themes, and the literary style. My favorite book of all I've ever read. It's so much more than the story, that to tell you what it's *about* would be a misleading exercise. Except maybe to say it's about erotic paranoia, life in the zone, and the horrors of British candy"
4,...,"Like driving when you're .... You don't know where you're going or remember why you're going there. Don't even try to understand what's happening. Turn analytical off. Open your mind and let the sentences flow in. If you manage to make it to the end, you will find yourself somewhere near the beginning, eerily relieved to be there. Returning from the multiplex cinema unsure if you've wandered into ""Being John Malkevich"" or ""Battlefield Earth."" The first few hundred pages, I thought, weren't so good, but you gotta read 'em anyway."
3,Slothrop's Odyssey,"Mix Joyce's ""Ulysses"" and a modern sci-fi novel, set it during WWII, and you get ""Gravity's Rainbow"". Like Joyce, I felt that GR was simply too much effort for too little gain. To understand even half of the book, not only do you have to read very slowly, but also slog through annotations or a separate guide. The time investment in comprehending this book is very large, and I simply do not feel that I walked away with enough to justify the time spent. If you are the type of reader who enjoys stopping to dig for secrets on every page, this book is for you. If you are a casual reader, it is not."
1,"worth one star, at least.","wow, all the hard work that this man put in just to bore me! the effort alone is worth a star. gallant attempt mr pynchon."
1,Better dead than read,"I have read Pynchon's stuff at least partly out of loyalty to a fellow Cornellian, but this was very heavy lifting, indeed. I only finished it beacuse I was on jury duty. Slogging through (is this the derivations of Slothrup?) this book reminded me of reading ""An American Tragedy"" in high school: I kept wondering why anyone thought this was a great work. For a MUCH more enjoyable, clever and funny book with real characters that covers very similar territory (and has more up-to-date references) try Neal Stephenson's Cryptomicon."
3,the recepient of 50s and 60s literature,"A gothic, surreal Catch-22. Could have been written only after Heller, and after Borges and Burroughs. Would be terribly boring if not for the dark, gothic, anxious language. And the language wouldn't work if we didn't have the epic battle of Good vs. Evil that we rightly associate with World War II. The modern writer's creed: ""If you put WWII in it, they will come."" Pynch lucked out. The subject matter has blinded most to what is a very unoriginal book."
1,I guess I'm paranoid too!,"This book has defeated me three times now, but I still feel like I *have* to read it. Remember that old joke that ends with the punchline ""...no soap radio!"", and didn't make any sense? I think this book was written with that joke in mind. And all of the 5 star ratings are the people that laughed at the joke......or maybe I really am stupid..."
4,"Easy to love, easy to hate","You could hate this book! Loan it, borrow it and see how you like it before you consider buying a copy.Someone said, ""To achieve the impossible, it is necessary to attempt the absurd"". GR is a book that almost constantly attempts the absurd... Many times the result seems to be a horrible mess, but there is still so much beauty, humor, horror etc. to be found in the passages of greater coherence. And it helps (for me, anyways) that the allusions and references I could appreciate (mostly those about science and history) were made with some understanding, rather than just being thrown in in an ignorant fashion for 'good' literary measure.I am very happy that somebody mentioned 'Radio Free Albemuth' by P.K.Dick. If you can tolerate sci-fi and would like a similar level of 'weirdness', but prefer a cleaner, more personal (alas, less colorful) voice, you'll find it a much better read."
2,The literary equivalent of hurling buckets of paint at a canvas,"Rarely is pretentious drivel so profoundly trite. Perfectly exemplifies the great post-modern con. A chaotic assemblage of random terms to which meaning is later ascribed, so much like a certain nostradomus.There are two principle types of literay work:1. That which is to be read. and of course2. That which is to be carted about, the title clearly visible, with a look of supreme smugness upon the owner's face.Gravity's Rainbow is quite obviously a work of the latter category.You see, I've come to the think of myself as something of an amateur post-modern poet; here is an example of my work:Ball, Kite, wolf, sky, space, heart, moon, expand, window, flowing, profound, pompous, gravity's rainbow.You see i'm quite the literary genius, somebody give me an award!!!What you fools fail to realize is that the post-modern style is simply a tool enabling those of simple mind to veil their lack of true artistry behind absurdity."
1,Paranoid Tripe,"Truly a mis-understood book, so much so that when published it was mistaken for a literary work and presented with the National Book Award. In the case of this book appearances turn out to be all there is. What appears to be aimless ranting - is, in fact, aimless ranting. Paranoid diatribes are, in fact, nothing more than paranoid diatribes (with a decidedly liberal slant - Earth to 60's liberals: an industrial/financial conglomerate did not precipitate World War II for the purposes of arms sales and the U.S. government is not bent on mind control). James Joyce was a geniune literary talent - he was allowed to be pretentious and he could get away with intentional obscurity. Pynchon is not a talent, and he is nothing if not pretentious (without merit) and intentionally obscure (better to hide his lack of talent). Comparisons to Joyce are insulting and absurd. Bottom line: A complete waste of time."
2,Novels are more than Context and Reference,"I read this incredibly convoluted, interesting piece of bricolage, and enjoyed the play of color and symbolism, but there is just not enough order within the novel to make the departures from order seem meaningful or contrasting. There is not enough true play or dynamism, just talk.A lot is also made of Pynchon importing scientific and engineering discussions into the realm of aesthetics; however, he does not make them poetic. Colorful, perhaps, and layered with bias, but not poetic.I don't require a linear narrative, but Pynchon's structure falls short of meaningful parallelism and degenerates into never-ending allusions and references.I want more from a ""novel"" than a convoluted, surprisingly static set of dialectic pointers. No one said it was easy to write a great Postmodern novel, so we shouldn't be too surprised to see Pynchon fail with Gravity's Rainbow.ARS"
1,Heavy handed tripe that academics love,"Here we go again, another book that only a tenured professor can love. There isn't a single fully developed non-wooden character here. The humor is so heavy handed that the jokes all fall like a ton of bricks. The plot reads like paranoia so severe that cultists would be embarassed by it. I found it unreadable and heartless. I take great comfort in believing that this will not survive with time but will be forgotten."
1,Don't bother,"400 characters and too many thoughts later I felt empty and used. Look, I've read Finnegan's Wake and I was confused and angry during ""Gravity's Rainbow."" 'Nuff said."
3,Love it? Hate it?,"I read Gravity's Rainbow slowly. For the last month, it's been sitting on my nightstand and I'd give myself a section or two before going to sleep. I don't really understand all of the 5- and 1-star reviews and the love it or hate it mentality. I think the book had magnificent, page-turning stretches that would go on for a hundred pages and verbose, mind-numbing description lasting 20 pages that bordered on free form poetry. Pynchon probably meant it to be that way.I'm giving a star for:* The heavily layered atmosphere of post-war Europe.* Pynchon's super-dorky one-liners sprinkled in here and there.* It's one of the few novels I've read that I am already looking forward to re-reading someday. (There's a lot still in there for me.)I'm leaving off stars for:- ""The Crying of Lot 49"" gives many of the same benefits in a much (MUCH) crisper story.- An overuse of song lyrics."
1,Since when does not liking a book you like equal idiocy?,"I DID read all of this novel and I DID understand it and it was a shameful, sad spectacle. The characters (and, hey, a novel is supposed to have them) were more wooden than mannequins. The story, when finally discovered, sounds like a bad LSD flashback and a very silly one to boot. No one denies Pynchon's intelligence. I do not deny the intelligence of the unabomber either. I just think what he wrote was tripe (Like what Pynchon writes).I thought this novel was a complete waste of my time and it amazes me to hear so many praise what I think was paranoid and resembles silly cult literature. My father had a book back in the fifties sponsored by an extreme right wing group that was equally paranoid and absurd. The whole tone of that bizarre publication resembles the tone of Gravity's Rainbow. But at least the fifties book had some unintentional humor in it. Pynchon couldn't write anything funny if his life depended upon it."
2,Painfully boring,"As a working screenwriter, I usually have the bad habit of buying a screenwriting book when I'm creatively stuck to hopefully jump start my imagination, or to help me shift perspective slightly. When will I ever learn.The book's Table of Contents looks impressive, but it was clear from the outset the author is an academic. I was truly hoping for something inspired with a voice and point of view. The prose requires a significant effort on the readers part. I felt like I was swiming through molasses.The film examples were cursory and the book in general, I hate to say is BORING.I felt like I was digging through acres of barren terrain for a few tiny nuggets of insights. I hate writing these negative reviews, but I felt compelled to this time.The information Howard supplies is valid if you are a film student, but not if you're in the trenches trying to complete a screenplay that isn't working and you want to discover why."
3,The Story of the Silent Serials,"Bound and Gagged ""The Story of the Silent Serials"" by Kalton Lahue,Story of Silent Movies. 352 pages with index. The adventure, romance, and pathos that were so much a part of the silent serial during the early years of the motion picture industry have vanished from the scene of the Hollywood movie studio. ""The story of the silent serial: its birth; its growth; its heroes and heroines; its successes and failures; and finally its demise. Author Kalton Lahue takes you behind the scenes, into the studios, to show you how the serials were made.

"" Kalton Lahue takes you behind the scenese, into the studios, to show you how the serials were made and much more... Full of black and white photos from the period"
3,Spiders of the World,"This book is geared to someone looking for information on the general habits of spiders. It has a great section on web building and habitats. This book does contains some pictures , but not for the purpose of classification of specific spiders."
5,A lovely book,This is a lovely book with a cute story and beautiful watercolor illustrations. It is fun to have the children figure out who is going to yawn next.
5,Championship surfer review,"This is an exelent game for those who like surfing but just can't hit the beach. It has the realistic seeings of the actual ocean, and is a fun game to play. I would give this game a rating of five stars."
1,HOW PATHETIC!!!,a tribute!!! most singers dont get tributes till they been performing for 20 years or so and she only was singing for a few months another pathetic attempt to make more money she not even a good singer she has to many digital effects in her vocie. if you are all stupid enough to like her so much to buy this then u need help!!!
1,I'm concerned for the music industry...,"This girl Debra G cannot sing. She is off tune in many parts of the songs and her pitch is terrible. No wonder her first record was a ""tribute"", or more of a collection of Hilary Duff songs that have been killed. I do not feel bad for Hilary, because after all, wouldn't anyone love a terrible singer creating a tribute to their songs? If anything, it makes her look BETTER. If you love Hilary Duff or her music, do not buy this album. Rather, spend your money on the music Hilary has recorded, because this record is hardly worth being produced."
3,Read This,"The Tribute to Hilary Duff includes the songs Metamorphosis, Party Up, Working It Out, Come Clean, The Math, Love Just Is, Why Not, So, Yesterday, Anywhere but Here, and Where did I go right. Don't think its Hilary Duff singing because its not. This one lady by the name Debra G. sings all the song. I guess in a way its a tribute because its just another person singing her songs. The remakes are kinda ghetto but some are alright. So if youre lookin to hear something new about Hilary then you got the wrong disc. If you want to hear somebody else sing her songs then buy it."
1,this (debra) is awful!! :(,"This is the worst cd ever! I'm not kidding! It's even worse than kidz bop. If you have ever heard the kids mix girl pop cd, debra sings why not on it!! A GUY sings Where did I go right! He is even worse than debra! Also, the band makes this music sound like it's for 4 year olds. Debra is probably a 40 year old making this cd for a joke. She is off key, scratchy, not with the music, and doesn't sing the right words."
1,OMG,"hilary rocks n her songs r gr8 but omg dat cd was rubbishda people cannot sing !!! ( soz ) never buy this cd!!unless you want a laugh !!hilary rocks, buy her cds not this !!!xxxxx"
1,What The???,"Okay, i am a huge hilary fan and have her cd, these songs are really bad, the girls voice sounds like a caffinated elephant lol maybe if someone writes songs for HER she will sound better, but leave the Hilary Duff songs alone!"
1,Yuck!,"Ewwww.... This didn't even sound like Hilary Duff! In fact, they spelled her name wrong on the CD! Only one L!"
1,OMG !!!!,OMG !!!!!!!! wot is this !!!!! dnt buy this cd .I would be offended if that was a tribute to me !!! the girl cnt sing ( soz)only buy this is you want a good laugh :)hilary rocks n her songss r gr8 she deserves much beta dan dis !!!buy hilarys version .... 1 million times beta !!!hilary duff rocks .... dis cd sucks !!!!!!!!!!xxxx
3,For Hilary Duff Collectors,"There are Fans and then there are Super Fans; The ones who collect the cd's, the posters, the magazines etc. This cd will appeal to the Super Fan who already bought Metamophosis and the Soundtrack album. These are different versions of the songs you know by a different artist. Are you a Fan or a Super Fan? Only you know for sure."
3,"Used and Cheap, What I Expected","Book took a long time to ship, had a few drawings and obscenities inside. Not a big deal, it was cheap and I'm a college student."
3,Less than informative,"If your looking for anything on canine separation anxiety, this is not the book for you. It has a very limited amount of useful information However, if you are looking for the very basics of dog behavior such as barking, destructiveness, improper urination, etc.. this book may be helpful."
2,Doesn't really help dry skin.,"I received a free sample in the mail for St. Ives 24 Hour Moisture with Hydratein Advanced Therapy 14 FL oz Lotion For dry Skin (Buy 1 Get 1 Free) I was so impressed with how soft my skin was that I decided to buy more when I ran out.Unfortunately, I couldn't find it in stores so I ended up with this St. Ives Intensive Healing lotion instead. I was really disappointed. My skin doesn't feel soft or hydrated and I've noticed that I get blemishes or bumps after use."
1,Disappointed!,"Though I've been a St. Ives user for a decent amount of time, I have become increasingly concerned with ingredients lists. Unfortunately, St. Ives is NOT vegan, containing stearic acid from pork, lanolin from wool, and animal-based glycerin and related ingredients. I was encouraged when I saw that St. Ives does not test on animals, but my encouragement quickly flew out the window when I realized the ingredients list contained far too many QUESTIONABLE chemicals (read about triethanolamine!) AND animal products/by-products. Suddenly, my skin doesn't feel so soft.Bye-bye St. Ives!"
1,wrong movie,"The Puppetmaster movie I received was not the one I ordered, plus the movie sent to me was unplayable."
1,Puppet Master 3D,"Case came completely shattered and in pieces with no 3D glasses to watch the movie and when the glasses to ""suit"" were finally found(bought at an additional cost)the copy was ludicrous.Complete waste of money."
5,GREAT!,"This is the first in the famous Puppet Master series.If I were you and I like the series,buy this before it's gone!Five psyshics hear rumores that a puppetmaker,Andre Toulon,has discovered the secret of life.When they go to investigate they find that he has found the secret of life and brought life into his puppets.The puppets later go on a killing rampage.This is a really good movie so get it now!The scenry and atmosphere is great.Including the music.The cast is great and the killing scenes are #1!"
1,dont buy unless you have the stutter glasses,"the 3D does not work with the red and blue glass like is said it does.you have to buy shutter glasses that suck any way.if you buy any 3D dvd find out more, lots of them are not marked right.and need shutter glasses and not the red and blue ones."
3,Pulling At Your Purse Strings,"For people intrigued by marionette manslaughter the first three movies of this series are the only ones worth checking out. Released in the early 90's at a time when the horror genre was weak, Charles Band's stringless assassins provided something a little different even though the idea now feels dated and quaint. As for the rest of the sequels, they morphed into ridiculuous cartoons sooned to be teamed up with other ""Demonic Toys"" that made up the Full Moon ""empire."""
4,"Great movie, So-so Transfer","Puppet Master(1989)Stars: Paul LeMat, Irene Miracle.Movie: 9/10 Video: 7/10 Audio: 6/10 Extras 5/10First of all, I had already bought the out-of-print American edition on Amazon when a friend ordered me this copy for my birthday, not knowing I'd already bought a better one, on account of my 2-or-3-year-long search for it. So I accepted, graciously.Anyway, the video isn't bad, but the color is a little faded compared to the American DVD. And the sound isn't bad, except in a couple spots where the sound effects are louder than the dialogue. This is a different soundmix than the American DVD. My only major complaint is that the print transferred was played a little too quickly, meaning the 88-minute-print runs in 85 minutes. If you can't find this movie anywhere else, then buy this DVD, it's worth it, but if you can get a better copy at a good price, go for that one."
3,good movie...not so good dvd,"dvd- this movie didnt improve much over the vhs version. on the movie back, it said 'widesrceen' and the movie didnt have that option and the picture was a little vhs-like in like 2 spots.movie- this as a movie is a great and fun film. it was funny to see small puppets come to life and kill people. its about a guy who uses voodoo to give his own hand-made puppets life and kill. i really dont know what to say about this movie but get it it is a great horror flick. if you already have the vhs version dont bother wit the dvd but if you dont have it at all get the dvd i guess."
1,Not sensitive enough!,"I received these from a different company, but I know they're the same kind of sticks 'cause they're identical... anyway, I tested at all of the times specified and NEVER received a postive result, yet my BBT shows that I definitely ovulated. I've since ordered the more expensive (and knowingly more accurate) Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor! I wouldn't recommend purchasing these!"
4,"Easy to use, economical","I found the strips very easy to use and much more economical than the store bought brands. I never got the test stripe to get darker than the control stripe, but there was a clear difference that I was able to conclude was a ""positive."""
4,Love the Thornberrys,"If your kids love the show, they'll love the game. The graphics and the real voices are sure to keep them happy. The multi-levels are great. What kid doesn't love them!!"
5,Calling all Wild Thornberry Fans!,"This game is great for the person (young & old) who love the Wild Thornberry cartoons! There are multi-levels, fantastic graphics, the character voices, it just makes the whole game fun and exciting! There are some levels that are harder than others and it may frustrate the younger gamers more than the older gamer. But all in all it is a great game and one that your child (or you) will enjoy!"
3,need to be a good player,it is a good game. the sound and pictures are good but it is very hard so if you are not a good player save your money.
5,Great View of an Era Passed,"I enjoyed this book immensely. The drama that unfolds is well described, and the prose is precise without being onerous. This book captures the spirit of Tip O'Neill's ""All politics are local"", and the manner in which Bulger and other politicians gain support and ply their craft is truly a view into the grass roots of politics, not as a gimic but as the way it had to be done. The characters are a colorful part of the times in which the simple act of standing out with a sign or declaring your support for a candidate to the people at the bus stop was important, raising the everyday citizen to the master of the political process."
3,Goofy,"This game was fun while it lasted. It is a very quick game, even for my four year old. The cartoons are a nice addition, as she loves goofy, but she can play the whole game at once. There are 15 different rooms and that is it. However, this is a game that she can play totally by herself, without any help."
4,Great first game,"I just got a Play Station for my 6 year old son. We got Goofy's fun house and had a blast. He loved finding the film cans. It was a great game for us to work on together. Today we got the bonus movie and he was really excited. The golfing game was great. My son loved it and plays it himself. Some of the games (skiing and car race) were a little hard for younger kids. Overall, we recommend it."
3,Silly fun with a favorite Disney character,"A fun Disney game for its time. Players take Goofy around his house, collecting film cans and playing a variety of ""games within games"" (like fishing, golf, worm collecting(!)). The main room of the house contains several portraits of Goofy in various poses - these portraits contain clues to the objects to be collected. Once a player has collected all of the objects for a given portrait, they can then watch old animated shorts featuring Goofy golfing, fishing, etc.Even though this is an older game, my kids still enjoy it. The levels are not too tough - younger kids will enjoy, but older kids likely won't be challenged (and probably will find the graphics rather dated)."
1,Tyranny,"Government propaganda all the way. They want to reduce world population to 500 million. complete genocide. Protect the rights of the people, not the rights of the government."
1,Not compatible with xP,"Despite what your ad says, the cd I received was for Windows 3.1, 95 and 90 and it will not load on Windows XP. The case is identical to the one in the photo still indicating that it works with XP."
3,"Word Puzzles, Searches, Cryptos and Crosswords Galore","Featured on this CD are 150 Daily and themed crossword puzzles, with topics such as picnics, animals, babies, music nature, and tons more. You can also create your own crossword puzzles. Also play Crypto-mania, Hangman, Word Scramble, and Word Searches."
5,Love this book,"I've only had this cookbook for a week and I've already made four of the dishes to much success. The recipes are simple but full of flavor. It's not a book that's going to hold your hand and teach you how to boil water, but a book that will show you successful combinations of flavors that lead to a delicious meal.I especially liked the recipes that had variations and showed how simple changes in ingredients could make a completely different meal. It's prompted me to make slight variations to the recipes based on ingredients I had on hand. Recipes are well suited to entertaining as the finished recipes are unique, easy to prepare and the beautiful photos show how to simply and elegantly plate the dishes."
5,The Instant Cook by Donna Hay,there are so many cookbooks out there but this one has 2 important qualities. The content is easy and there are no long processes in my busy life to deal with. The recipes are very well tested and the book is lovely to look at too.I have not tried her other books yet but intend to do so. BA. NYC NY
1,Is this the same book?,"I am shocked to read the reviews on this cookbook. It's terrible. The pictures are beautiful, and the food looks wonderful, but the cookbook doesn't hold up. The recipes will call for ingredients that are not in the ingredient lists, and you have to know how to cook to use it...for instance, it will tell you to use 3 slices of ginger, but won't tell you to peel the ginger first. Elsewhere, it says to ""bring to a simmer and simmer"" when it means bring to a boil and simmer. We tried 3 recipes, all of which bombed--2 of them were too spicy to eat, and I love spicy food. This is a horrible cookbook. I can't figure out why Donna Hay is such a popular cookbook author. The only cookbook I ever threw away was her Fast Food cookbook for similar reasons, and this one is just as bad, although I did hear the Sticky Chicken and Parmesan Chicken recipes were good. Try them first."
3,weird cord length,i'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that the earpieces are not equidistant from the center wire. it's very awkward that the right earpiece is approx 12-15inches long meanwhile the left earpiece is like 6 inches long. it makes your head lopsided and looks absolutely ridiculous. i know this doesn't affect the actual performance but it is a flaw nonetheless.
2,Not comfortable or reliable,"I thought I had big ears, but the diameter of the headphones are bigger than the entrance to my ear canal, even with the foam pads removed. Since they are solid plastic (not rubberized), they aren't very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.They also aren't very reliable. When inside my jacket pocket, while sitting on the train, the jack can come loose from the socket on the bottom of the treo 650, which causes either channel of audio to be lost completely, or causes the music to skip around."
2,crappy sound and unreliable,"If you plan to sit perfectly still while listening to music and don't mind lousy sound quality, this unit is for you. If you hoped to utilize the all-in-one, portability aspect of the Treo to its fullest by, say going for a jog or riding a bike, or if you just want your music to sound decent, look elsewhere. (Though I don't know where that might be as of yet.)After about 1 week, one of the earpieces properly functions only intermittently. I find it exceedingly annoying that the company that manufactures the Treo and markets the device based in part on its versatility and ability to ""take your music anywhere"" makes only one model of stereo headset, and that the model they do make is overpriced, not dependable and poorly engineered."
2,Palm 680 deserves better,Works but uncomfortable. Buds are too big and hurt after a while. Quality is only average - not great. Only bene is that they don't require an adaptor. Ended up buying another set of buds with an adaptor.
3,Breaks after a year,"Somehow, these stereo/earphones ALWAYS malfunction after a year or so of purchase. I bought one two years ago and one of the earpieces wasn't working. THEN, I got another one right before Christmas last year and it broke too.I loved it while it was working properly (you could listen to MP3s on your treo and then switch to an incoming call at the press of a button)but I HATE the fact that it gets busted after one year or less.Is there something else out there that will last longer???"
1,No so great,"These did not work since the day I got them.The right earbud never had sound.I got a replacement, and it's the same situation.I am not sure if it's because I'm using a Nokia E71x, but they both don't work properly."
1,never did work,I ordered this product a month ago and it never did work.so I ordered another one and that one didnt work.......it is my advice that you never should purchase this product.
4,Decent,They work well for listening to music I havent tried to use them for a phone call but for my purposes they work well.
4,You get what you pay for,"Its not the most amazing headphones I've ever bought but for the price I paid for Im happy with how they work. I love how I can go from listening to music to a phone call and vice versa. I've had them for about a month or so now and they still work pretty good.The right side has a little buzz sound now when listening to music at a certain level but that could have been my own fault.Also I use it on my Palm Centro which tends to get stuck thinking its still plugged in but is simply fixed but poking a tooth-pick inside which can sometimes be a hassle if you dont have one handy.In all, if your looking for some amazing sound and what not, keep looking, but If you just want something that works and will keep you happy enough to get by for a great price, look no further."
2,I guess you get what you pay for,"I didn't pay much for the headphones, they were definately afforable and delivery was fast and prompt. However the headphone bud is fairly large. It hurts after a while in ear. Also they constantly fall out and cut in and out of conversation. They are better if you use them for listening to music verse holding a conversation. I am happy with the shipping and delivery but not so happy with the product. I guess you get what you pay for. :("
2,"NEEDS ""EARJAMS""...","I bought the headset at a very fair price and the sound quality is pretty good. I'm now able to use my Palm Centro as a personal stereo BUT the earbuds do not fit firmly in my ears and fall out easily so, as a solution, I'm buying a set of Griffin Earjams. I hope I can get them cheap."
4,Very Useful,I found the headset to actually work really well. It's really nice to have the person you are talking to coming into both ears. The quality seems just fine to me and everyone can seem to hear me just fine. A worthwhile purchase.
3,"Okay, but I want something better","As other reviewers have noted, the earpieces are too big. Great idea, marginal sound qualitty, functionally fine, but uncomfortable and falls out of your ears if you're trying to do anything active (like walking). I've used them for over a year, and it's time for something more comfortable."
1,does not work,"This headset does not work on my LG101. I have 2 different headset and both are working just fine. So I do not know what is wrong with this. The seller sent another one but still the same problem. I cannot hear from my ear and the person on the other side of the call can hear me very low. However, worked fine with another cell phone brand. So it is just with the LG 101."
5,Rififi,"I have been looking for this movie for years, since I first saw it in 1956. To me it was a mystery classic then, and time has not changed my opinion."
3,"A Classic, But Not Perfect","Beautiful, and a great movie through the completion of the caper (which is rightly praised as one of the ""fathers"" of most heist scenes), but the stupid ""mistakes"" made after the caper by members of the gang may spoil the enjoyment of those not watching as film buffs, but rather as people wanting to be entertained. (SPOILERS ALERT) The premiere safecracker who doesn't know not to spend some of the take the SAME DAY as the heist? After members of the gang are murdered, the rest of the gang doesn't think to safeguard their families? Tony the supreme planner doesn't make an agreement with Jo about waiting for his call? Sorry, WAY too many mistakes for such ""pros""."
3,Hardly a classic,"If Dassen's political views had been, say, right wing, would any of the ""fillum"" critics pay much attention to this at times interesting, overly long, and painfully melodramatic gangster movie? If the film hadn't featured barely clothed women, would it have been praised at the time? I feel sorry for the ""film studies"" students who must endure this movie and write silly, politically correct essays on its ""message."" And if one of them dares writes ""The Wages Of Sin Are Death"" a failing grade is perhaps in his or her future. In short, this is tedious viewing, strictly for those wishing to appear oh-so-sophisticated. I'll take any number of Edward G. Robinson films, some made more than twenty years before this ""pathbreaking"" French movie."
4,Film Noir Made in France,"Cool film in the streets of Paris. A jewelry heist that has your heart in a fist for quite a while. A group of losers that come together for one more hit, one too many. Grey sky, dark wet streets, and sticky tune. Family and crime don't mix well, love with a night club girl brings only trouble. Crime doesn't pay, but one has to learn by experience. Towards the end of the film your pulse runs wild and the little kid playing in the back seat of the runaway car can really get on your nerves: it brings the little kid in 'The Third Man' back to my memory.All in all a great French film by an American expatriate, one of America's most talented directors by the way. Dassin, the director, also has an important role in the film and he is interviewed in the dvd extra."
2,2 stars for the 2 stars...,"The HBK/Taker match is 5 stars all the way. Considering that's the only good match, I have to rate this mania with 2 stars.Why advertise that we will get to see past divas in this huge battle royal, then not show them? They are there, but instead you see kid rock playing through the entire entrances! I think I saw Sunny for about 2 seconds if that, and that's all. To top it off, they had Santino in it and he won... WEAK!Kid Rock pretty much killed the show with that long set he played.They have edited the blu-ray heavily.The rest of the matches were average to pathetic.This is one of the top 3 to 5 worst Mania's ever."
5,Amazing show!,Great DVD. a few editing jobs that shouldnt have been. one of the best Wrestlemania Pay Per Views of all time.
4,wrestlemania 25th edition.. (Extras?),"man. reading the previous reviews for this disk set,all i wanted to know in buying it was what extras it had,but everyones so caught up in their own glory and opinions it seemes they dont have time to tell me what else is on the disks?!!!!!!! i dont wanna know who won the matches moron!! just tell me what the extras are.... geeZ...thank you..im gonna buy this anyways cause i live in houston and didnt get to see it,dont keep up on it like i used to,but this ones in houston and takers still wrestling..so why not?i guess ill have to wait till it comes out to find out the extras...way to go guys.. idiots."
3,ok ppv,"I've been a huge fan of wrestling for a good 15 years. To me it seems like wrestlemania has slowly gone down hill. The only match I really enjoyed this year was Michaels vs. Undertaker, imo match of the night. It really sucks that they edited out Kid Rock's Performance and theme from the show, the dvd really lacks of extras as well."
4,"Great Blu Ray, but weak Wrestlemania",The quality of this blu ray is stunning and is a much better improvement by the WWE over Wrestlemania 24's release. I just wasn't a fan of the matches in this years Wrestlemania. The story lines were weak and the matches were just average. But the blu ray is great to watch and I'm hoping the WWE will release more PPV on blu ray soon.
5,planter box,What one would expect from k-mart or Target; nothing fancy- services it purpose. Black strap in the middle to keep the middle from bulging when filled with soil.
3,Water Damage,"There was more damage than was described. The book also smells like mold, which could possibly be from the water damage."
4,Great to work with Textbooksrus,"The book was described as used-very good and it's true. It looks almost like new and arrived in a timely manner, before my classes began. I have ordered other books with Textbooksrus and have yet to be disappointed. Thanks"
2,"Uncomfortable, difficult to use","Definitely not the most comfy of headsets. Sound quality is good, but I prefer the Jabra brand. I found it difficult to put on unless I had two hands free- thus defeating the ideal ease of use of a headset. Not recommended."
2,Save Your Money,"I read the reviews, which were pretty positive, so went ahead and ordered this hands-free. I don't think it's comfortable and I don't think the sound quality is good at all. Hard to hear the person on the other end clearly. Good thing it was less than $10. Save your money. I'm sure there are better ones out there. You may have to pay a little more, but this one isn't worth the savings."
3,ok,I don't use this anymore because it has gotten really tiring of keeping it in my eye I will never buy these again becuse I really have no use for it anymore.
3,Plantronics M220,"A mistake on my part, but I was new to the headset vs Bluetooth applications. I thought I was getting a bluetooth headset, but was mistaken. My mistake, not the seller!"
1,DEAD ON ARRIVAL,DOA Do not buy this thing does not work not even once save more money and buy a more expensive one.
2,Wrong size. Watch out,End is not standard size. Had to buy additional connector which also didn't work. Would not recommend this product to anyone
3,Bit thick and heavy.,"Not very comfortable but it operates well for Xbox. It's thicker than it looks online adding to the weight. Hurts my ear, inside and out, after about 70min use. Plantronics makes more comfortable headsets than this normally."
1,Doesn't Make the Grade,"This headset has low sound volume, both incoming and outgoing. I simply wouldn't recommend buying it at all."
1,Horrible! Do Not Buy!,This product is horrible. The sound is okay but it's too quiet for the person on the other line. The headset does not fit on your ear either. However the worst part is that since it does not fit on your ear correctly the part of the headset with the microphone in it sticks out from your face about 3 inches. I'm returning this item right now.
3,"Great reception, Uncomfortable in the Ear","The reception is great, but I can only tolerate the earpiece for a limited time. It never really ""fits"" into the ear and becomes painful after a short time. What a shame for such a nice earpiece with good reception."
2,Low volume,"Even with cell volume on maximum it is hard to hear, everyone hears me fine. This is such a well know brand I was really disappointed with this updated version of my old headset which I leave in the car due to heat and cold. I should send it back, I have fallen back to the old headset which is 4+ years old and is just better quality."
3,"Uncomfortable, but works good","This is the first headset that I've used that didn't come with the phone. Usually the ones with the phone are earbuds with a dangling microphone. This clearly has a better mic than those. People don't even realize that I'm driving down the highway. The earpiece sound is not great, the phone earpiece is better, but the sound is good enough.The biggest complaint I have about this is that it is really uncomfortable. When I use it, I'm constantly adjusting it. There are probably better headsets out there, but this one is just adequate."
1,Cheep headset with poor sound,I bought this headset for use with both my Siemens cordless phone and my Kyocera cell phone. On both phone people told me I sounded very soft and far away. The sound quality on my end was also not that great and the headset as a whole feels very cheep.
1,Very uncomfortable,"i would not buy this product..worst purchase on Amazon...headset has no padding, and hurts the earlobes..."
2,Poor Sound and Fit,The sound is very low and the fit around the ear is very loose. I'd pass on this one.
1,Not Made In the USA,"It looks and feels cheap. It is very hard to hear from the ear piece, which is also uncomfortable. Don't waste your money on this. I already thru mine in the trash."
1,movie fell flat,"Kitten was not flat, just the movie. first of all it is very short. maybe 30 minutes. Kitten does some nice strip tease but that is it. horribly over priced. they must have seen me coming. I have regifted this turkey///buyer beware..."
4,A wonderful story I was lucky to read long ago...,"Nothing as of lately has thrilled me more than seeing this book in print. Several years ago, I was fortunate enough to be one of Dann Hazel's students. And fortunate enough to see this story in the early stages. My opinion of this novel then is the same as it is now--it's a great read that feels real and true in the way the story is told. This book has a ""young-adult"" feel to it, but not in the corney way most young adult fiction comes off these days. Dann Hazel has a great voice. And with it, he told an amazing story."
3,"Good story, easy read","This is a touching, engaging story, the emotional journeys of the main characters being of foremost importance. Ever present in the story is the notion that lies and deception can come to no good but that the truth can set one free. Although not classified as such, this novel could fall easily within the realm of young adult literature; there are no gratuitous explicit sexual scenes, and the few physical situations that do exist, as well as a bit of off-color language, are germane to the story."
2,Limited value,"Stridsman's work reads like a lab book recollection of his experimentations rather than a systematic study of creating profitable trading systems. The text is repetitive, and filled with illogical analogies and examples. His conclusions are based on some dubious suppositions -- he seems to lack a strong grasp of the statistical analysis he employs.Among the benefits of the book are Stridsman's adherence to standard deviation in assessing system risk and his use of percentage measurements rather than absolute dollar values.This book could be 75% shorter and still contain all the worthwhile information.I would recommend Conway and Behle's ""Professional Stock Trading"" as a much clearer approach to creating trading systems."
1,In the first chapter the Author says he is not a trader. I agree.,In the first chapter the author even says he is not a trader. I agree that with his statement that he is just a technical writer. This book is an interpretation of the Tradestation statistics (which you can get from Trade station). He tells you how to read the lab experiments. There is hardly anything to do with actual trading systems. If you read the title closley is reads Trading (BUILDING AND EVALUATING) Systems that Work. This is more about evaluation and less about building.
1,Doubt,"I'm asking why the authors of this kind of book (Trading systems that work, The ultimate trading system, Winning Trading Systems, How to make 1.000.000$ in one year with Futures and so on.)they are not living in some beautiful islands of the Pacific with the broker who sends them checks every day. Why they need to write books? for their ""infinite goodness""? , I don't think.The sad truth is they do BIG BIG money selling the books and not following their system trading.Bye.P.S. If you think that you need to buy 100 T.A. books , just stay out from this business."
2,Trading systems that confuse,"If you're building a computer based trading system, this title offers some interesting insight. There are several example trading systems that implement commonly used system features, and these systems are analyzed and commented on. But this is far from a blueprint--the methods used are too rough to actually use as defined, and the descriptions are very confusing in many places. Included TradeStation code is a bit easier than most to understand, but that's not saying much. Every time I read this book, I feel like my time would be better spent reviewing Conway & Behle's ""Professional Stock Trading: System Design and Automation"", which covers much of the same material but with considerably more coherance."
4,Good techniques for developing a system,"If you want a caned system, this is not the book for you. What this book will teach you is how to evaluate a system that you are developing. It is a little hard to read, but the excel formulas are worth it.It covers the essetials of a good trading system (entry, exit and money management) and explains why not all good trading systems are profitable. (All profitable trading systems must be good first)."
4,Good,"This is good for programmers. It's a bit beyond me but I still got some useful stuff out of it that gave me an edge so that made it worth it. If someone is a programmer, this is your book. He's great and gets you thinking."
5,Very helpful,I've been at this game for thirty years and have accumulated an arsenal of books. This is a 'must read'. Very helpful.
2,"This indie horror movie is not that good, regrettable purchase","WARNING: This Review Contains Spoilers. I thawt this might be good it really isn't. I have seen worse but this flick is not worth watching in my opinion, there just isn't much to it,a pathetic lonely man buys whores, finds one he likes (a serial killing cannibal, zombie that kills and eats her johns) and she likes him. They fall in love, she quits the business and they get married, he helps kill and get feed for her. A madman whose brother was one of her victims searches NYC for her leaving a bloody trail in his wake, the rest is history. Fairly well made for a low budget indie film but most of the scenes are short and shallow. I'd give it 2 Stars, Fair movie"
1,I wanted the main character to die,Terrible acting and the male lead acted like a teenage girl. He was a complete wus of a man and I was very frustrated that he wasn't killed in the first 20 minutes.
1,Nothing good,"The product washes out on close pictures and is dark on far pictures. The camera's built in flash works much better.Digipower doesn't answer email, I have yet to talk with a live person on their 866 number."
2,Blood and Honor,"This book was a major disappointment to me. I've read other books by George Anastasia and liked them very much. I was looking forward to this book, But I did not enjoy it at all. To me it seemed more like the story of Nicolas Caramandi ( Scarfo soldier, turned goverment witness)I would have enjoyed it more if went deeper into Nicky Scarfo's rise and fall."
2,Dull and generic,"This book takes one of the most interesting Mafia sagas -- the rise and fall of the Scarfo mob -- and burries it with every cliche in the so-called true-crime mafia genre. Unless you're from Philly or a die-hard mafia buff (god forbid), this book will not engage."
3,Hit and Miss.,"On a personal level, I thought this book was just alright. Not the greatest. There isn't a plethora of text written on Scarfo, so this was a good insight. Unfortunately, it seems rather dry in places and since it's about the Philly mob, those who aren't locals won't be familiar with the players. It's written in a similar style to 'Underboss', the Sammy Gravano story, although this came first. For a look at Scarfo, I say pick it up. If you're just looking for some Mafia reading in general, keep browsing."
5,Savoring every page...,"Loving this book! I'm forcing myself to read a little at a time because I want to savor every page. The story is compelling and the writing is great. I only wish Anastasia would approach Mr. Scarfo to get his version. Seeing that he's older and, probably not ever going to be free, maybe Nicky would tell his story. I'd love for Anastasia to get that assignment. He probably would too!"
5,Great read,This is a book that can not be read without some afterthought. A real eye opener into the Scarfo family. One of the mafia related best reads.
1,Borrowed Hearts,"Hi,I have not received this DVD. Could you please send me the e-parcel tracking number? The Post Office can track the parcel if I have this. Alternatively can you find out what has happened to it, when can I expect it to arrive? Borrowed Hearts]]"
3,"Enoyed the movie, love Roma Downey.","This is an old movie that I thought my grand daughters would like, it also shows money and important positions aren't always held by well meaning people. The selfishness was overcome though by the little girl's acceptance of the weakness of the ""boss"" as well as a very selfish father, and her mother's committment to not nnly her own world, but those she worked with."
5,Borrowed Hearts,It was a gift. The person receiving it really loved it. I have not seen it. It appears to be a re-make of Christmas In Connecticut with some changes.
4,Cute holiday movie,"Just a cute holiday movie of which there are many to relax you during the season. Nice to have gentle movies made with lots of love in them. The daughter, Chloe and of course Hector were especially good in the movie. Kind of thought Roma Downey and Eric McCormack were an odd match. But I very much enjoyed the story."
5,Borrowed Hearts,"I love this story which I first saw on TV. The DVD is new, plays well, and I can watch this story whenever I want. It's a great story."
5,Borrowed Hearts Worth the Price,"This is probably one of the best holiday movies out there. It's so popular, that when it is shown by a major cable tv network , it now only airs once instead of several times like the other Christmas specials. It's a special event not to be missed.In any event, it's well worth the high price that many people complain about. It's out of print now, and the company that produced it has no plans to re-release it any time soon. If you love this movie as much as I do, get yourself a copy. You won't be sorry!"
2,The Editor borrowed more than Hearts!,"I LOVE this movie and watch it every holiday season. So, I was thrilled to see that it was on dvd. I ordered from one of the sellers, received it promptly, in good condition and was very pleased with my purchase until I watched it. I just about blew a gasket. Parts of the movie are missing and actually some of the lines that are missing are my favorite parts. I don't know who in the world decided to make a dvd and market it as the actual item but it's missing parts and I am very disappointed.UPDATE JAN 2011:I just purchased the dvd where Roma Downey and Eric McCormack have their heads together on the cover and I am SO Happy that it's the movie in it's entirety. The other shouldn't be allowed to be sold without a warning of being cut. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on that one but you buy the one with the new cover you do get the whole movie. HURRAY!!!!!Now I would rate the movie 5 STARS."
3,Delightful Christmas Mssage,Originally saw this movie on Lifetime and enjoyed it so much I had to purchase it. Acting is pretty well done. Definitely worth purchasing for a holiday collection.
5,One of the best,This is Defiantly one of the best most heartfelt christmas movie. I love hallmark and ABC fam Christmas shows and this one is top notch. Makes me smile everytime I watch it.
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY MOVIES,"I really ended up liking this movie more than I thought I would. I had read the good reviews before I bought the DVD, but I have to admit that based on the story, I had some reservations. But as it turns out, I was really touched by this movie, some parts make you laugh and others bring a tear to your eyes. I thought the acting was superb especially by Eric McCormack, Hector Elizondo and the adorable child actress that plays the part of Zoey.The story is magical and this is one movie that has borrowed my heart!"
5,Extremely Positive,"""Borrowed Hearts"" is a 'dream-come-true' movie, reminiscent of movies of old. It warms the heart and reminds us that, as the Bible teaches us, all things are possible ~ although not always in the way we had originally thought!"
3,Happy Ending,"A new twist on an old theme. Love Hector Elizondo in the role of the ""angel."" Charming little movie with a happy ending."
5,borrowed hearts,This movie came in at the right time and it was all packaged up like it was suppose to be. I had been looking for this movie in stores but no matter where I looked I just couldnt find it. So I went to amazon and they had it for a great price and it even came with a music CD. I am very happy with my order.
5,Brrowed Hearts,"This was a great movie when I first saw it, and it was great to find a new copy at such a fantastic price."
4,Film--Borrowed Hearts,"Our order came through very quickly. Our only problem was that there was a short portion of the film near the end that was difficult to view because of poor tracking. It was worth it to have the film, though."
1,Love the movie!,"I love the movie which is one reason why I ordered it. Unfortunately, while my account shows it as shipped/delivered, I have yet to receive it.If you're looking for a modern day holiday romance, this is the movie for you. Roma Downey stars as a single mom who is asked by her employer to be a family in order to fool a prospective buyer. Fortunately for him, she agrees and then starts the drama. It's a wonderful story line with a great ending for all involved."
3,Edited DVD,"The original movie was excellent, but the ""Feature Films for Families"" version leaves out critical information and scenes that make the outcome of the movie more meaningful. This DVD should be marketed honestly as an edited (censored) copy of the movie. I would've preferred the original.JH"
2,Edited,"I was disappointed in this product as it had been edited from the TV version I had originally seen. I didn't realize the DVD was being offered by a 'family values' group. Although the original version was barely PG, the editied version is now definitively G. Several lines of dialogue between the 2 main adult characters were removed and an early scene which defined what kind of man the main character was has also been removed. It's still a good movie and if you haven't seen the original, you probably won't care. Personally, I dropped off the DVD at the Salvation Army and just kept my video-taped off the TV version - commercials and all. For me, the interaction between the 2 main adult characters was what had made the movie worth $25 (with shipping), so losing that was a big disappointment for me. For me, it was a waste of money. If you have kids, though, it would probably be a good buy."
5,Romantic Christmas Story,"What can I say. Everyone that I know has been trying to purchase this on DVD or VHS. I bought both. Normally the VHS tape is better - the reason is, it has a full screen - too many heads get chopped off in DVDs. Roma Downey is always good in shows, the little girl ""Chloe"" is a very good actress, as is our favorite, as always, Hector (can't spell his last name, you know the actor - Runaway Bride, Pretty Woman, etc.).I have waited several years for this movie!!! Thanks for finally releasing it for the home box office."
2,Unsatisfied in Tulsa,"I don't know what the Movie is like, because the seller didn't send it to me and I can't get ahold of them. Standing Ovation is NOT a reputable company. DO NOT buy anything from them."
5,Borrowed Hearts,Borrowed Hearts is a heartwarming story and it has become my favorite Christmas movie. I have to say that even my husband enjoyed it. Do keep a kleenex handy.
5,A love story,Very good story line. Once you start reading you don't want to put it down. I am looking forward to more books by this auther.
4,Great Movie!,I have so many Christmas movies and this is one of my favorites for the holidays. I watch this movie every year and never get tired of it. You will enjoy it as much as I do and want it in your collection too.
4,Recommend as good family movie,"Normally I do not have any desire to see the actors in this movie. I saw it first by accident and surprisingly liked it. If you expect a technical review of the strengths and weaknesses of the acting, photography, etc. read someone else.What I like about this movie:1) It is entertaining.2) No gratuitous obscene language or sex. I am not against either (I like girls and I swear) but I don't like movies that depend on these for customers at the expense of plot, acting, etc.3) This can be watched with children, your self-righteous friends, your mother-in-law and your too correct, straight laced aunt."
4,Borrowed Hearts DVD,"The is a cute and touching movie. I enjoy watching is every Christmas and even when it is not Christmas. If you haven't seen it, it is a great watch for the whole family."
5,Sweet American Pie,"A manipulative little tale that uses every shameful trick in the book to open the tear ducts. But you can't help but like this square of sweet American pie. My wife blubbered away and my eyes filled with tears when the little girl, cut up about her dad going away choked back the tears as she pleaded ""am I so unlovable?""Watch it and weep."
3,Borrowed Hearts,"This is a sweet movie about a special Christmas, a feel-good-movie to see more than one time, mostly because of Eric McCormack and the little girl Zoe."
1,So bad I'm actually angry!,"If you thoroughly enjoyed the film, Borrowed Hearts with the beautiful Roma Downey as I did, I'm sure you'd wonder why I would give it one star. Well, that's only because Amazon.com doesn't allow for negative stars, so I can't actually give it a proper rating. However, I can tell you that this is a hatchet-job of editing that removed, seemingly for no reason whatsoever, key scenes in the story that left us scratching our heads in disbelief.I have no idea what actual thought process was behind removing so much of the film, but I can honestly state that no logical explanation is possible.Bah! Humbug!"
1,Very disappointed,"I was excited to find this movie on DVD. It is a good Christmas movie. However, I was very disappointed in the DVD. The DVD is poor quality. The images are so dark that the movie can barely be seen. Shame on Echo Bridge Home Entertainment for selling such a low quality DVD. Don't waste your money on this DVD."
4,A good buy,"Well made, good price. Only negative is it requires small padlocks to be truly escape-proof. Would recommend.Sportsheets 5 Piece Hog Tie & Cuff Set Bondage Kit"
5,OZ BREAKS BADNESS!!!,"OZ producers generally aim high and hit their target often, and EK is no exception... Along with other essential producers such as Dark Alley (Phil K, Ivan VanGoh, Luke Chable), Jase from Outta Space, Nubreed, Infusion (the list goes on...) this EP is a collection of some very minty 12"" material for those cd bad boys such as myself...essential breakbeat that should not be missed...there's melody, dark breaks, nuskool and old electro...wait, i think i even saw the kitchen sink on the inside cover...."
4,Not an Action movie,"This is not an action movie. This is a documentary about Martial Arts as practiced in the Shaolin temples. Many of the seemingly impossible moves are shown here without special effects. Some of the feats include, one finger handstand, breaking glass bottles with an open hand, withstanding kicks to the groin, pushing against the point of a spear with various parts of the body, having sticks broken across the throat, using the thigh as a cutting board and many more.Jet Li shows up in this movie primarily as a commentator. He gives some of his personal history (The wushu tournaments) and philosophy (such as respect for elders). There are also some scenes from wushu tournaments in China, but the primary focus is on the training at the temple.I can only give it 4/5 stars because the picture quality is not very good. But the content is great, just don't expect an action movie."
2,Cheapo documentary,"This isn't the same as Jet Li's Shaolin Temple movie - it's a cheapo documentary of Shaolin monks with godawful narration and subtitling. Not much Jet Li, and not much other interesting stuff. You get to see some monks get kicked in the groin and drag around giant stone rolling pins with their gonads, but that's not really what I want to see when I get a HK movie. Boo."
1,Heavy bass distortion,"I bought this for my daughter at Christmas and she just came to me asking why it sounds so bad. The automatic bass causes the bass output to be distorted & sound terrible. I tried my professional quality headphones & the same distortion. Tried new batteries, different CD's all with the same lousy sound quality. If you could turn off the DBBS, maybe it would sound better, but is always on. Don't buy this player."
2,Quite disappointed,"I bought this with the highest hopes, but was rather disappointed when I opened the package only to find the front scratched and the hoop (that connects to a necklace) bent at about 45 degrees. Luckily (or maybe not so luckily) the metal is VERY pliable, so I was able to bend it to its correct setting. I don't think I'll be wearing it as often as I had hoped."
2,My babies don't like them,"Neither of my twin girls have any interest in these bracelets and socks. Plus, the socks very easily come off the feet."
2,SO DUMB,"I hope my mom never reads this. She got us these for christmas.. These things are so ridiculous and small! The legs are too long and WAY TOO TIGHT!!! The wrists are OKAY. The ones we got are striped black and white he looks like the wicked witch of the west. You can have em, I'll ship em to you for free."
2,Wrist rattles are great. Foot rattles aren't loud enough,Bought these for my daughter as a stocking stuffer. Not many options for a 1 month old!She like the wrist rattles but the foot rattles don't stay on and they don't make enough noise. I thought they'd encourage her to touch her feet but she ended up touching her feet more when they were off.
3,Baby not very interested so far,"My son is a very alert 4 month old and so far has no interest in these rattles. Mind you he has no interest in his feet so far. Same concerns as a number of reviewers: 1. rattles not loud enough (we do live in a quiet house with only one musical toy, our baby not used to loud electronic noises, but these rattle are very quiet). 2. Bracelets very small (may be for safety reasons so there are no loose ends?) On the other hand foot finders do stay on very well is put on top of socks or pajamas."
2,Barely rattle,"These are very cute, but they don't make enough noise to be effective. My daughter hardly pays attention to them because you can barely hear the rattle."
2,Babies didn't like them,"These looked adorable and like they were a great idea. However, neither of my babies expressed any interest in them as infants. They either ignored them or cried until I took them off. They rediscovered them when they were a little over a year old and wanted to wear them then. I have tiny twins (who wore 6mo clothing on their 1st birthday) so they still barely fit and my kids did have fun with them for a few months. But if they had been any closer to average size they would never have used them."
3,Baby isn't interested,"Thought these rattles were super cute and colorful, but they just don't interest my son. Hopefully he changes his mind!"
2,Cute but pointless,"Babies will find their hands and feet without the assistance of wrist and foot rattles - all of those fingers and toes are a marvel without putting something on them! This will rope in well-meaning in-laws who want to speed the development of their grandchildren, but it's not worth the purchase. Cute bright fabrics, but the rattle is almost inaudible, and the baby would need to shake wildly to get it to make any noise."
3,He's just not into them,"very great design, very eye catching, but my son has never paid any attention to the wrist straps. I attach them to his gym bar and he looks at them, but on his wrist he never looks at them. He's 4 months old and over looking at his hands, so I do put the foot ones on him still, but his feet are too big to fit inside fully, plus their not designed like socks, so they don't go over his heel... I'm tempted to sew the bug onto his actual socks because he will pull at them and pull the booty right off"
4,eh.,"I love the concept of these.... it's just that 1. I wish the rattles were a little louder and 2. the socks aren't that stretchy and they are kind of small on my 3 mo. old's feet. I think he'll grow out of them this month. I don't know... i just think with some minor improvements they could be a much better quality item. Like the little antlers on the bugs are kind of poky. I like them, but i don't love them. I think the idea of the rattles are 5 stars but the execution is only a 3... hence the four stars above :)"
5,Super Fun,"My daughter is two months old and LOVES these already. She brings her legs up, and her eyes get wide. Than she giggles, and talks to her feet. It's adorable. This is the best price too, I paid more at the store.The socks are a wee bit big for a baby her size, but I know she'll grow into them."
1,Useless body rattles,"When we put these on our grandson's wrists and ankles, the rattle sounds were so minimal that they were inaudible when he kicked and moved his arms. Did not serve the purpose at all. Although they are cute to look at, they are not really rattles. I returned them."
3,only for very young babies,"I bought this for my son when he is 3 months old. The wrist bands barely fit, and the socks are way too small. Plus, the socks are low quality, not elastic, not even foot-shaped. The bugs are cute though. I think I will just use the bugs as hand-held rattles."
3,Good concept but execution needs some work,I thought these were a great idea. I'm not sure what age our daughter was when bought these but she was a couple of months. She never really played with them when we put them on her wrists however she did like them when we dangled them over her or put it on her play gym.At 8 months though she plays with them as part of her regular toys and loves shaking them and chewing on them.There are 2 major flaws with these.1)The socks are not stretchy at all and even as a small baby we couldn't get them on her feet.2)The wrist straps are extremely small. They barely fit on the baby's wrist. We thought putting them on the ankle would be fun too since the socks didn't really fit but the straps are so small they didn't fit on her ankles at all.
4,great idea,"My 3 month old daughter doesn't really like to look at them but she love to eat the bee ... hahai put them on her play mat and she looks at them. the socks are way to small for her big feet but i am going to take the bugs off and put them on sock that fit her, hopefully that will work :)"
2,Rattle hardly makes any sound - Socks hard to put on,"The socks are not stretchy, hard to put on baby's feet.Rattle's sound is so discreet, I can hardly hear it."
5,My Granddaughter liked them!,"Good size for babies, colorful enough to get their attention and spark curiosity. I used to put them on her wrists mainly and she would play with them..or bite them. They are very easy to clean and served their purpose well."
1,The socks aren't shaped to fit a human foot!,"My baby never got interested in these; it ended up being a waste of money. He didn't seem to even notice them. Additionally, the socks were very difficult to put on. They were too tight (even when my baby was just an infant and small for his age) and more importantly they are poorly designed. They are just narrow tubes, they aren't shaped like a human foot. After struggling to get them even partway on, they would constantly come off. I'm really surprised at the other positive reviews. I was swayed by them when purchasing this product. It is a nice idea, but didn't pan out for us. Products that I would recommend instead for 2-4 month olds: the ""winkel"" and the ""skwish"". Those were the best toys!!!"
2,"Seemed like a great idea, but baby isn't interested","These seemed like a cute and perfect idea for baby to play with. I got them before baby was born. Baby never showed an interest. We use the socks as sock puppets sometimes now to get some use out of them. The wrist toys were never played with. Baby loves all the other Lamaze toys, as do I, just not these."
3,Baby doesn't care for it much,"The rattle sounds like a weak death rattle. The colors are bright and cheerful, and it looks cut on his little wrists, but i'm not sure it's doing anything to stimulate him. The sounds are too faint to grab his attention. I wouldn't recommend this particular product."
3,Just OK,"These are super cute but fell a bit flat for me. One of the socks was made incorrectly and had no stretch at the opening. I also wish the rattles had been louder. Otherwise they were made well and I think the idea is a good one, I just didn't think they were good enough to bother replacing. I just sent them back for a refund. Thank you Amazon for making that right!"
3,Wish they were smaller,I received the item and couldn't wait to take it out of the package and put them on my three and a half month old daughter. When I did I was surprised to see that the socks were way too loose to stay on her. I look forward to using them but the width of the socks will prob be way too big even in a few months. How sad! I truly hope I didn't waste my money.
4,"good, but not big enough","I was very excited for this item to arrive after hearing how much my son enjoyed it at daycare. Unfortunately, we don't use it very often as the sock does not fit over his hand very well. Seems too small. It would be great if they stretched more."
2,Good idea but not loud enough,"I loved the idea of the wrist rattles. Unfortunately the rattles are really quiet and you can only hear them when it's absolutely silent around :( So in the end they don't work the way they are supposed to because my baby doesn't get any positive reinforcement for moving his arms and legs.He likes to look at them though, and they are really cute. That's why they still deserve more than 1 star"
2,Poor Quality,"The Quality of these toys is very poor - although these are relatively inexpensive, I would not purchase this brand again."
1,Son is not interested,"I gave it to him when he was 1 month.... he did not even notice it. Tried again every month. Finally he noticed it when he was 4 months and was annoyed by it. At six months, he rips it out and throws it away. :("
3,Too quiet!,"I think these are very cute and use them, but the rattles are so soft (volume) that you can barely hear them... Hard to use the noise for baby to discover her limbs if she can hear them..."
3,Very cute but not interested,"I hate to give it a mediocre score but my little guy just wasn't interested in these at all. I think they are super cute, non-irritating, and a great idea, but babies are so fickle. That doesn't mean your baby won't love them but you really have to try it to see for sure, as with most baby toys."
3,rattles quiet,our little one does not seem to here the rattle. it's quite quiet. which i guess is good and bad.
2,Cute but useless.,"These bugs are very cute. You can display them somewhere, so your baby can look on them. My 3,5m baby likes to look on them when on his hands, but just few second when and after putting on. And note, they DO NOT rattle almost at all!!! If you put two pennies in your sock and shake it, it would make more noise then this."
2,Never played with,I bought this for my then 4-5 month old and he was not impressed by it at all. I've tried putting them on him throughout the months (he's 7 months now) but it doesn't interest him in the least.
5,Very cute rattles! Toy measurements in review:,"We have had ours for several months now (bought when she was 3 mths, she is now 7 mths.). Our baby still plays with them even though I don't put the rattles on her anymore. She loved kicking off the socks. Which was fun to watch. It's all great exercise for baby. I have even used one of the wrist rattles in her car seat. I attached it to the strap so that she had something to play with because she isn't able to really keep a good grip on toys, yet. The socks are really great for her because they have more material for her little hands to grip. ***Here are the toys measurements (taken with seamstress tape): Wrist Rattles: 5 and 5/8 inches, Sock Rattles: 6 inches.*** These toys have machine washed well in a delicate cycle and air dry. These rattles are adorable and definitely worth buying. They would make a great baby shower/welcome baby gift."
3,Not a fascination for every baby,"I read the great reviews and thought this would be great for my 3.5 month old daughter since she likes to watch her hands move a lot. Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to take very much interest in the wrist rattles. I agree w/one reviewer who said that they don't rattle very much unless you really shake them hard, which it doesn't look like a baby would do? Also, another reviewer mentioned that the foot socks are not stretchable so it's rather difficult to slip the foot finders on & off my little girl's feet -- they seem to barely fit and she is at 50% weight for her age! So I slip them on her hands instead but all she does is stare at them..."
3,fun but small,"The idea and the product are great, my baby loves them, the only problem is their size, my daughter is 5 months and they barely fit, I would have liked to use them more."
2,yamini atluri,my baby hardly notices the colors and the rattles are not loud enough . not worth the buy . will not recommend it
2,Made well ... but not supper interesting for baby,"I have purchased other Lamaze toys and have been very happy with them. Like other Lamaze toys, these were made with very high quality. The issue is that they aren't all that interesting. The rattles don't make a lot of noise, so my little one wasn't that interested in them. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't purchase these again."
3,Positive,"My baby likes these and the colors are bright and fun. The rattles could be a little bit more, they are hard to hear; not very loud. My baby girl is an average size in the wrists and ankles and the wrist ones stay on fine. After having them on for awhile and kicking and moving her legs, within 15 minutes the feet ones will fall off. I thought at first they were like the wrist ones and velcroed on, but they are socks. They fall off fast and then you have to keep putting them back on. All in all they are ok, if they stayed on better and rattled louder I would give them a 5."
3,"Wrist rattles are nice, socks come right off","I have been using these since my son was just a few weeks old, as they are very cute. My son loves the wrist rattles, but the socks have no elastic to them and slip off very easily even when he wasn't able to pull them off. Now he's 5 months and these don't stand much of a chance against him. They are still cute, and he enjoys the game of pulling them off, but keep an eye on them or you'll quickly lose them!"
3,Polyester??? COME ON!,"First of all, I can't believe, that this item is 9 dollars now. I've just bought it recently for 13 buck. Not a big deal, but:((( I would say this is a nice idea and a good thing to have. Nice colors, cute things. My daughter is 2,5 mo. now, but she doesn't seem to notice those on her hands. Only when I hold them before her eyes. The second thing, which is disappointing for me, is that the socks are made of POLYESTER! and 100%!!! The rattles are very quiet, could be a little bit more sound."
2,Cute but ...,"These are very nicely made and well designed, but the rattle is nearly inaudible, frankly, a dud because of this flaw. Bottom line, if your looking for a cute pair of socks and a pair of cute bracelets, this is a winner."
3,A so-so addition to the Nerf arsenal,"The glow in the dark darts, though novel, don't fire too well. The gun is somewhat awkward and difficult to cock. A decent gun, but not nearly as good as many of the others."
4,Shoot your siblings and Dad!!,"My 11 year old daughter needed to defend herself from her 10 year old brother...shoots straight and fast, glows and flashes nicely...I love nerf"
1,Brought it back to the store within 15 mins,"The darts became jammed in the gun, and it would not shoot. They do not tell you that the ""glow in the dark"" effect is done by wrapping paper around the darts, this did not last more than a few mins and the paper came off the darts. Very poor product in my opinion. I would not recommend it."
3,O.K Gun if you are in close combat,"well this gun doesnt really shoot thirty feet i would say more like 10 feet. i though that this would be a great a gun. the origonal dart tag gun has two more barrels and is smaller. the light and glow rffects of the dart and gun are pretty useless because who will play in the dark? the light flashes so it gives a reallistic feel to it because it flashes when you shoot it. it is a great gun in close combat but a horrible one if you are outside. it is really easy to fix when it does break, the spring flew off the loader on mine and took 2 minutes to fix."
2,Fell apart too quickly,"I purchased this gun to shoot family members and co-workers with. It fell apart after 15 or 20 uses. The ""ammo"" doesn't stay loaded and half of them pop out the gun every time now. I understand that this is just cheap plastic crap but I was hoping it would last longer than just a few months."
2,Fun but light doesn't work,"Fun nerf toy but don't by it for the glow/light effect. The darts aren't glow in the dart, the paper stickers that you wrap around are (these fall off and don't hold the light very well). Also the flash of light that is supposed to happen at the pull of the trigger is unreliable at best. Still a fun toy but not for those features."
5,Great Gun!!!!!!!,This gun is awesome! I had one but it broke. wasnt guns fault it was mine i dropped it like 50 times so now im getting a new one. when i had the gun it was awesome i have at least 15 guns and this gun was in my top 5. GREAT GUN!!!!!!!!
1,Do not waste your money!,"This product is terrible, the range is next to nothing and so is the accuracy. Also the dart holders constantly release the darts which decreases the minimal range. You can get much better nerf guns for a lot less money."
2,Firefly REV-8 review ACKWARD,I got this toy for christmas and im 13 i got it when i was twelve i found it was very awkward and very big i thought that it should have been smaller and the darts are very hard to find i ended up using the dart tag darts the ones with the velcro and found they were to long for the barrel i trimmed them with some scissors and that did but after about a week it wouldnt shoot the darts any more like i loaded up 8 darts all made sure they were fitting cocked and fired nothing happened just the noise you get when you fire a nerf gun without a bullet also the cocking mechanism is hard to pull back and it might hurt a childs hand after pulling it back so much i got a blister as i said its very large and wierd shaped it is very large for an average 8-9 year old. i would not reccomend it.
3,Okay toy,"It is OKAY toy. I think the reviews I read was a bit overly appraised. A day after one of the two I bought has problem already. It has 8 slots for darts but 3 out of eight slots have problem. Every time my [...]loads(pushes in towards slots) all 8 darts, 3 of them will pop right back up. It doesn't load darts securely. And like it says it is for 6 years or older. In order for you to shoot the dart you would have to slide that yellow piece backward. And my [...]has hard time pulling that slide. And you have to do this every dart you shoot. It definately look cool and sturdy. also it will help to buy some extra darts."
2,Eh its ok,"Awkward to shoot and very awkward to cock, but it doesn't jam up like many other nerf products. Range is fairly limited."
1,Junk,Never worked very well. Doesn't shoot straight and always jams. Over all poor design and pretty heavy. Wish I would have gone another direction when getting something for my son.
2,Looks much cooler than it is.,"I purchased this Nerf N-Strike Firefly Rev-8 for my son's Nerfday. He is 9. He thinks the gun looks very cool. As others have mentioned the ""glow in the dark"" feature is in the form of stickers, which don't stick really well the day you install them, I don't expect the to last long. Also the range on this gun is not very good. It usually fires a dart about 15 feet, occasionally the dart will go 25 feet. My son has about a dozen Nerf guns, and most of them shoot 25+ feet consistently. If it was my choice I would (and did) buy the Maverick for $8. It also has a barrel (with 6 darts), so you don't have to reload after every shot. The Maverick is a bit smaller, and it doesn't have the lights that this one does. The Maverick shoots much farther than this gun, more consistently. Also the Maverick doesn't require batteries.If you want a gun that looks cool this one is good. If you want to have fun playing with the gun there are many better choices."
4,Fun but darts sometimes fall out,"I like the glow in the dark concept and the shooting mechanism, but sometimes the darts fall out. Overall a fun toy to play with though."
4,A Very Handy Blaster,"I have this, and many other Nerf blasters, and this one is very versatile in the heat of a Nerf battle. It is very nice to hold, can be reloaded quickly, has pretty good range, and VERY good accuracy. The reason I gave this thing four stars, is that it just barely reaches the thirty foot mark with the glow in the dark darts. If you use regular micro darts, or sonic micro darts, then this thing will really go the distance. The reason being is that the stickers you put on the glow in the dark darts decrease the range somewhat. It still shoots a fair distance with the stickers, but it is a couple more feet without them. In all, I think this is definitely a very good thing to have in a Nerf battle, and I reccomend it.Sincerely, Davy Jones"
4,Normal boy's review,"When i first got my firefly i was excited. I opened it up and started shooting it around. I was a little disappointed because it shot the bullets 3/5 of the distance the Nerf maverick shot it, it was difficult to aim with it, and it wasn't very accurate after it flew 5 feet. Although when you put the stickers on the bullets and batteries in the gun it becomes cooler and the bullets fly better. Another good thing is that it is easy to shoot, reload, re-cock, and can hold up to 16 bullets at a time(4 extra bullets at the sides, and 8 bullets in the wheel)."
4,N_strike firely revolution 8,"i give this nerf gun gun 4 starts,this gun is a good nerf gun by nerf gun standardsthe glow ammunitionis kinda stupid theres no need for replacement darts becuse the glow idea is useless it will only give away your positionand can anybody tell em wher ethis gun fits on the n-strike thing?next this gun isnt a asualt rifle kinda weapon its being held like a machine gun its a semi auto gun with a rifle but thats got a eight round cylinderand a 8 round holderand its range is weak good power from 20 feetbut only usefull for 10 feet and maybe from a elevated positiona good buy for 20 bucks if your new to nerf but theres just better guns out there with teh same purposeand probaly cheaperand yes this guns in my main aresenal becus eits a intinmidating gun and itll do the jobpoint ishave fun and this uses micro darts"
1,Insanely bad,"This gun is horible. I have found that it does get 30"" like mentioned on the box. But that's only without the sticker. This gun is extremely inaccurate after ten or fifteen feet the dart goes soaring down to the ground. It is extemely bulky and hard to use if you attach a strap to it. So there's no way to srap it or holster it on to you when you change to a sidearm. And the guy that said this is like an assault rifle is just wrong. Assault rifles are %99 of the time fully automatic(machine guns). A nerf gun like this is the rapid fire twnety. Often the gun jams and this is horrible in the heat of a large scale nerf war.If you put any sonic darts in they will go speeding out of control and your last shot will be a horrible disaster. Overal I think throwing nerf darts is more effective than using this gun."
5,Awesome gun!,"This is a great nerf gun! The range is good, and the space in the back for eight extra darts is fantastic!"
5,Everyday Lessons,"Everyday of your life there is a new lesson to be learned. The Listening Tree is full of everyday lessons that are learned and taught by experiences and the love of God. These sweet stories that are compiled in this book help you view life with spiritual heart.Joyce Ann Edmondson compiled an amazing collections of stories that anyone could relate with from small child to parent to grandparent while learning some very sweet lessons in life. Very well done Joyce Ann. This must read has brought a smile into my heart and home. Thank you,C.J. WilkesDaddy, I Forgive You"
4,Typical Penthouse letters,"If you love Penthouse letters then this is a good collection.Let's be honest, we know why we read these and this book fits in one hand easily.Not the best Letters but above average!!!"
4,Raunchy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is exactly as the title says raunchy but it is very erotic. Like it alot!!
3,didn't get it for xmas,great album but it didn't come at the time stated....it cameafter the holidays.
3,Second Best,"Not as good as ""The Trouble with Humans"" CD, but we really do like this duo. They are great together. What good harmony!"
1,A Terrific CD,This is fabulous music in every respect. My wife and I just discovered Chip and Carrie and are grateful to the person who introduced us to this CD. This couple deserves a lot more attention and exposure than they seem to be getting
4,Good but get The Trouble With Humans first,"If you've heard the hype about Chip and Carrie, it's basically for real. This new album, Red Dog Tracks, at it's best, is downright erotic, but the covers are unnecessary as are the instrumental and reprise of Keep Your Hat On Jenny at the end.It seems a little slicker than the last one too, maybe because they're on a major label now.So, there are about 7 or 8 great new songs that make the purchase worth it, but if you're like me, you'll be programming around some of the filler.Buy it, but just know that their second CD, The Trouble With Humans, had no filler and better songs, so pick that one up too!"
4,Comfy but not a ton of arch support,"I am always searching for the perfect comfortable and stylish shoe. This shoe is almost perfect! The hard part of making a comfy shoe is that soft materials can just make the shoe have less support. What manufacturers need to understand is that people who need comfy shoes, need them because they are on their feet 10-14 hours a day and NEEED ARCH SUPPORT! These shoes are very soft and comfy, for about 8 hours, after that my arch starts to feel it."
1,Terrible sound!,I was very excited to receive this cd as I am a DJ and my show is blues based. I buy many CDs and and I've never had one with such terrible audio. I will not play it on my show! Buyers beware!
1,Don't waste your money,"This made in china hoe broke with normal use. Unfortunately, I bought it last year,so I can't return it, and never used it until a few days ago while preparing my garden. I was just hoeing in loose soil, taking out weeds, when the whole end came off the hoe. See my picture above. The wood handle was cracked, which made the metal part loose, so it fell off. I have had problems with all of the ""Ames true temper"" products. I also bought a straight hoe, which bent during normal use. ""true temper"" not at all. If the blades were really tempered, they would not bend.My Dad had tools like this that lasted his whole life. Now if you want a quality tool, you have to spend a fortune. I can't justify spending $60 for a hoe. Ames and Amazon, shame on you for selling this junk!"
1,Too much effort - too few results.,"I tried the exercises in this book for three months to see what results I would achieve. Unfortunately, I didn't notice any noticeable results. I even had a friend take a picture of me before and after 1, 2 and 3 months to see if I could see a difference. I didn't. A friend of mine who does facial exercises told me to get a copy of another book on facial exercises called Facercise. I did the same thing here. I took before and after pictures at 1,2 and three month intervals. I was excited when I could see a change in one month. I actually had several people tell me I looked different after 2 months. That's all I needed. I can feel my muscles burn when I do Facercise. I didn't get that feeling at all when I used this book. Sometimes you have to try different things to get the results you expect. I just wish I'd started with Facercise first, not the other way around."
1,painful,"This book was very disappointing. There are no photos in the entire book; instead there are just line drawings. I tried a couple of the exercises and immediately had significant jaw pain. I have issues with TMJ, but had not experienced any jaw pain in almost 15 years. Just one of these exercises was enough to bring back immediate pain. This was the first book that I have ever returned to Amazon."
3,Not the Sleep You'll Want,"Sleepy John Estes was a blues performer who could really sceam out a tune. His voice was high, a bit slurred, and seemed to be ful of pain. Those who met him suggested that he was living a pretty hard life. Certainly, by the middle 1960s, when this album and a few others were recorded by Bob Koester of Delmark Records, Estes was not teh same performer he'd been back in the 30s and 40s (and this does not go without saying -- many elderly bluesmen were still astonishing performers in their 60s adn 70s). Estes is still very good, but something of the energy was gone, perhaps, though a tune such as ""Broke and Hungry"" should play right to his strengths, I found that the album was more interesting as a documetn concerning Estes than it was as great mucis. For that, you've got to go back to his great stuff in his prime. This is good stuff, but not great."
4,Great Shiping,This worked wonderful with my new Mallory 475601 Distributor.Now truck has more power and even getting better gas milage.And WOW Fast shipping you cant beat that.
5,sharp very nice,"worth the price ...starts sharp and stays sharp a long time between sharpening. way better than cheap sets, looks good, easy to clean holder, I've had the set since christmas and really like it"
3,Beautiful set but needs improvement,"This is gorgeous, but does require you to take the block apart every now and again to clean. The bread knife is excellent, the large chopping knife is good and so are the smallest of the two knives. The fillet knife is too dull for cutting cuts of meat without effort unless frozen, and even then it's not the greatest knife. If that knife was of higher quality this set would get four stars."
5,Best set owned by far,My wive loves cooking and always bought henkel. I purchased this set and even she thinks this its the best set by far. Like razor blades. shave with out and you will understand how sharp these knives are. Just purchased a mercer sharpener. Great product.
5,Wifes Knifes,Purchased for my wife and she couldn't be happier. We had been using hand-me-down blades and they weren't cutting it. (pardon the pun}
4,Makes me laugh just to think about it again!,"There's no two ways about it... this book is funny. Witty. Endlessly sarcastic. There I am, reading it in the park, and laughing out loud in certain parts, like a bit of a loonie!At one point, the author calls what he's doing here ""sketches"". That's exactly what it is... connected vignettes. Observations of the lives that make up Miguel Street, a street in Port of Spain, Trinidad. It is all set down and seen through the eyes of a young, fatherless boy.It is written with such a clear eye that it seems autobiographical, and here on Miguel Street we see the germ or the kernel of many of the characters that Naipaul would develop further in his excellent book ""A House For Mr. Biswas"" which he published two years after this one.As others have mentioned, the language, the idioms, the vernacular here are priceless... 1940's Trinidad bursts into view.I give it 4.5 stars. Refreshing. A little book with big laughs!"
5,"Funny, but real. This book is a treat","I first read this book in 1978. Twenty years later, it is still serious, funny and most importantly is a pungent reminder of times past.Highly recommended."
3,Cute,"This is an easy read. It is cute and somewhat poignant, but with an underlying sadness at times. As an American reader, I did find the blasé way that wife-beating was presented to be disturbing, but I've always resented overt didacticism, so I suppose I should appreciate that Naipaul is just telling it like it is/was.Although reading this was a nice way to while away a few hours, I don't think it is ""book discussion"" material. Most of it is very light. The last couple of chapters are the ones with the most depth."
4,"""Miguel Street""","Here is 1940s Port of Spain, Trinidad. Miguel Street is a melting pot at the ends of the British Empire, which, during WWII, is already on the ebb. Naipaul's first written and third published book tells the stories of Miguel Street's characters from the point of view of a young boy. Each of the stories are illuminating portraits of the limitations of colonial life. If you're looking for parables about poverty or racism, you won't find them here. Instead, you will find Naipaul's genius penchant for telling sad stories with great humor; and, rather than lessening the sense of the tragedy, Naipaul's humor makes it that much more impactful. Those who are also fans of Paul Theroux will recognize than the later writer used ""Miguel Street"" as the DNA for his ""Hotel Honolulu."""
5,completely inspiring,"i recieved this book as a gift and i don't think i've ever had such a beautiful present! every single page gives so much inspiration and it's an amazing reference book of many different photographers. and also, one can look at the most beautiful person in the world-bjork in so many different ways. BUY IT!"
1,Save your money,"This book was probably the worst purchase that I've made in a long time. The story on the cover is beautiful and really captures the essence of Bjork. I was hoping for more of the same on the inside, but I was very dismayed to find that the book is mostly photographs with far too much whitespace (nearly half the pages in this book are blank). To add to the insult, there were photocopies of the CD album covers, which, when combined with the caption, spanned four pages. Any true Bjork fan surely owns all the albums and having photocopies of the album covers is such a filler.To top it all off, a load of crud was yanked from the internet (including a very outdated survey) and thrown at the end of this book.I was expecting so much more.Bjork is amazing, talented, insightful, and beautiful. This book is not. You'd be better off going to any Bjork website. It'll have a lot more content than this book offers."
3,If Photos Will Satisfy You...,"Even though I'm a huge Bjork fan, this book still dissapointed me. The book is a collection of some wonderful photographs of Bjork, including many intimate and beautiful ones. For readers (not lookers), there is nothing to be offered - the editors seem to have felt that they should throw some arbitrary text in the middle written by arbitrary authors - and they really shouldn't have. The centre articles offer no insight into Bjork's thoughts or life; they are simply a collection of why the authors think Bjork is special (and who needs to know that!). After the halfway point, some very strange and ""arty"" pictures are included to finish off. Buy this book only if you are interested in some wonderful photo's of Bjork and if you don't mind the relatively steep price for what you're getting."
4,A little skimpy for the price...,"I love Bjork as much as the next guy and more than most, and was very anxious for the release of this book, and of course I wasn't disappointed... per sei. The book is fairly light on content (only a couple of articles and a way outdated Bjork obsession quiz), a ton of pictures (though some of the pages between them are actually blank), and of course the 4 pages for freinds (some of which are very interesting, some are just sorta poinless). All in all, there's little INSIGHT, which is what it seems a book like this would be ideal for. And the pictures are of course beautiful in their artistry (and utterly stunning in their subject matter), it just seems like this book isn't everything it could have been and that, for the [price], it really should have."
5,An emotional book,"This is a gift to every Björk fan in the world. Every single page is an emotion, every page tells you a little story, and that helps you to collect them in major story that will describe Björk. Even though the book has not many words, those words make you think, those words urge you to ask yourself things that will make you meditate about your real connection with Björk and what is your real situation in it. Perhaps is not a book for everybody, but it works for me."
4,The Helix is a pip of a fan with lighting,"Westinghouse 7875300 Helix Four-Light 52-Inch Five-Blade Ceiling Fan, Black with High Gloss Black GlobesA bit hard to install, especially the lights, but it does the job it's supposed to do with ease and it's practically noiseless."
4,Good enough,"I've just passed my Linux+ test with score 860 out of 900 today. Overall this book is okay if you already got many background in maintaining Linux System, but if you don't have a broad background in maintaining Linux system, you may need to use several additional books, for example this book is lacking some information about some commands, such as 'netstat', which was on my test. This book is also lacking some stuffs that may need some fixes on the next edition of this book such as NIS/YP, hardware stuffs, and some scenarios (with files operations, network operations, etc.) which may help those who don't have strong Linux background.Anyhow, I've been maintaining and using many of *NIX flavors such as Linux (Slackware, Redhat, Debian, Mandrake, SuSE), FreeBSD, Sun Solaris, HP-UX servers for at least 3 years by now, so my comments may be a little bias."
2,"BOOK ISNT THAT GREAT, FOR people who know hardware!!","THIS BOOK TALKS TO MUCH ON HARDWARE THEN SOFTWARE. THIS ISNT THE A+. GO FOR ANOTHER BOOK, STAY AWAY FROM THIS. IM RETURNING THIS TO AMAZON."
4,Great read into the life on the frontline,I found the book a great read. It kept my interest with raw accounts of a soldier on the frontline
1,"""Poorly written, waste of time""","This was purchased for my father as a gift. He hated it. Here are some of his quotes, ""Wasted words. Repetitive and useless. Statements simply don't ring true. Author only interested in praising himself. A complete waste of time.""My dad has probably read hundreds of war stories. He says this one is, by far, the worst. It was very disappointing."
4,Memphis Gangsta Walkin Vol.1 Album Review,"I love this CD! I think it's the best CD to come out of Memphis this year. King JC is featured on here along with DJ Trick. Both of these guys are tight. They are the best Rapper/Producers in the south. They been in the game for years and they're just now starting to get the props they deserve. My favorite song on the album is ""The Dirtiest"" by King JC cuz the beat is so crunk. They also got a female artist featured on that song named ""Misfit"". She's flowin so good. I think everyone will love her. Another song I like is ""Put it Down for Your Home"". It's the last song on the cd but it's the one you can really feel. Overall this album has some supper hard production and some of the tightest flows I've heard in awhile, a must get. I can't wait till King JC's solo drops. He has it advertised on the inside cover of the cd. Be lookin out, It's called ""Ana Of My Chest""."
3,dolphins and whales 3d,"the under sea colors are not very clear,everything seemed flat ,this may be from the water depth . 3 d isn't that impressive but it was very informative"
2,Dolphin is Drudgery,"The 3D is so-so at best, the picture quality varys from very good to poor. But the real problem is being beaten over the head with ""The Message"". Every nature show now can't get produced it seems unless after showing you all the wonders under the sun they then get to preach about conservation and how the death nell is sounding for the planet. OK, I get it and I'll sit through it I have nothing against conservation, great idea. But this show is just depressing, the writing is awful, and most of the photography is boring.I'll sum it up... whales and dolphins are dull, and you are killing them...I found thisIMAX: Deep Sea (Single-Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo)to be far superior, oh yeah-you'll get your message in this too ,but it's an easy pill to swallow compared to the drudgery of Dolphins and Whales..."
4,good 3d,we purchased this movie for our grand-daughter who loves dolphins and she really liked the 3d effect . It was like she was swimming with them.
1,find a different one.....,"We couldnt even watch it, it hurt the eyes too much. Maybe it is because we need a bigger flat screen, ours is 47"", not sure though....."
4,Good info average 3d,"I just recently purchased at least 12 three d titles, and watched Partly 4 of them. This movie gives good info on the different species of dolphins and whales, but in comparison to the Other movies I have watched, the 3d was just average at best. I probably would have enjoyed it just as well in 2d. When u compare it to the others the picture quality and 3d seems blah, but if u like learning about dolphins and whales it's worth watching."
4,dolphins & whales,the 3D really shows the dolphins up close and the whales a little too close but all in all good movie especially entertaining for kids
3,OKAY.......,I got this game for my birthday.The only problem is that it is a one timer.It is only exiting the first time you play it.Then it will get boring.You do the same missions over and over.Not even a strong Doug fan would like this game.
4,Great Game,"Doug's Big Game is great if you are a fan of the show. If you aren't, it might be a little confusing. The object is to find Patty Mayonaise, who was supposed to meet you. You must go around the town and talk to people who will give you clues to where she is. Some of the clues are completely useless. Like when Skeeter says one of his shoes got thrown into the lake, he tells you to help him, that's all. If you don't watch the show, you wouldn't know that Mr. Dink has all the gadgets you need. Overall it is a fun game. The minigames are especially fun, although it would have been better if there had been more. I would recommend this game to anyone 7 or up."
3,A little too simple...,"I am a big fan of Doug and the gang, but this game was simply too easy to conquer. Graphics are great, and the missions are simple...which makes it GREAT for younger kids who enjoy the show, but it is very easy to save Patty Mayonase - (I saved her in a matter of a weekend) Overall? Cute, but not challanging :)"
3,It was an OK game.,"The game is what you would expect from a tv show. It's nothing like ""The Legend of Zelda"". I wouldn't really recommend this game."
5,A must see!,"'Rock n' Roll Heart' captures everything that is magical about Lou Reed both as a musician and an icon. The documentary charts his career from the Velvet Underground to his current position as an elder statesman of the rock scene. There are key interviews with John Cale, David Bowie, Patti Smith, David Byrne and Thurston Moore, illustrating how Reed's influence has remained strong through time. The director also focuses on the main influences on Reed which range from Delmore Schwartz to Andy Warhol. Overall, an excellent film."
4,Lou Reed,"I really enjoyed this DVD, I have always liked Lou Reed's music but did not have much of an understanding of his history. This is a good documentary style DVD that gives you a feel for the man, the times and what influenced his music. Interviews with friends, colleagues and other artists give you a good feel for what he is about. If you like his music and want to know more about the most difficult person to ever interview this is well worth while."
4,Usable Techniques that Work!,"Dr. Day provides some excellent techniques that will work on your kids. Some of the techniques seem unusual, but once you use them, you'll find out they rock! Also, Dr. Day gives great stories about his kids and the techniques, which is really unusual. Most authors/therapists/doctors don't talk about their kids and what they all went through. By using his family as andecotal stories about the techniques, the book is easy to read and understand.Very definitively a worthy book to read!"
5,How to Raise Kids You Want To Keep,"I bought 4 books, one for me and a friend and one for my daughter and daughter in law. We all found the book to be easy to read. The methodsreally work. You also recognized yourself and others. The book also makes you laugh."
1,Not heavy enough,I bought 2 of these for a 30 06. They will not hold the scope. It moves alot. When I try to clamp it down hard enough to hold the screws strip very easiliy. Not recomended for anything above a light cal. Gun.
5,why not a 6th star?,"This is familiar music to some of us, but even if it's your first time, you'll immediately note how flawlessly Paul and his band play these old favorites. The tunes are fun, usually clever, and are guaranteed to get you whistling. Most of all, Paul's style is hard to beat. If you buy this record, you'll understand what I mean."
4,helped my swing,"overall I enjoyed the DVD. My swing had all sorts of kinks in it that I was trying to work out. I am novice when it comes to golf, however I am competitive and just want to become halfway decent when it comes to this frustrating game. I thought the DVD certainly helped my game, it had good tips and drills you could practice on your own. The only downfall is David Leadbetter is very dry and boring in this video."
5,My hubby is Loving This,"I bought this as a surprise for my Hubby. SURPRISE! First he's glued to the TV, then he's on the golf course trying this out! Ladies, this is THE PERFECT GIFT for the woman who wants time to go shopping! I love it!"
1,A Horrible Book if you could call it that!,"This book is a photocopy of another smaller book and a blurry bad reproduction at that. My advise is there are better books out there, steer clear from this very rough ashlar!Fraternally"
3,"Close, but not quite","I think the age range should actually be 5-10 years. For anyone over 10 (and maybe even younger than that), the game gets boring quickly as it is limited in scope. Other than that, it is cute with decent graphics and a good idea for a kids' game."
3,Tom and Jerry House Trap,Cute game. It has the same cat and mouse chase. My kids 5 & 6 love it. Does has minor violence as the cartoon.
2,Too Easy!!!,"I love Tom and Jerry.I thought this game would be some big game with a long plot.I was wrong 3 times.It isn't a ""big"" game;it isn't long;and there is no plot!It's 7 or 8 levels.I beat in in 32 minutes.(I guessed the time)There are no scenes from classic Tom and Jerry cartoons or any other type of Tom and Jerry animation. This game is a waste of money.I would give it 1 star but I liked the 2 player.Overall,don't buy this if you can get to the 3rd world in Crash Bandicoot 3."
2,Good basic material but not deep enough,"This book provides a good basic reading material which would be useful to get a first sight of valuing a commercial bank. However, for practicioners, it seems that the book is not deep enough to answer ""why"" questions and not technical enough in providing enough ""bullets"" to be used in the real world. For me it's dissapointing, since my colleague recommends it highly."
5,Ageless humour,"This series was made many years ago this is evident by the style of the characters and the motor cars they used, but the humour is ageless. It's as funny (and pertinent) now as it was when first released; Martin's antics can certainly be seen in some of our own offbeat neighbours of today. The frustrations and setbacks he suffered when trying to progress a project or interact with his neighbours, (especially Paul), keeps each episode bouncing along, and like slapstick they have never lost their timeless humour. Martin takes himself very seriously, this itself engenders a comic element, especially when thing invariably go wrong for him and Paul steps in and sorts them out immediately."
1,Wings too heavy,I own a variety of LEGO sets and they hold together very well. This kit is an exception. The wings on this model do not stay together once built according to the instructions. They require constant checking. After it is built it can't be played with or held because the wings collapse easily. Evidently it must be for display on a shelf only.
2,Great with one big exception,"I purchased this over other cheaper options on various websites thinking it would be a versatile option to tap the line output of my iPod. If you're simply using this with headphones, it works fantastic and I don't believe you'll have the issues I'm having. On the other hand, if you use it with a cable much larger than the white earbuds there's one unfortunate oversight by whoever engineered this product that renders it useless and potentially hazardous to your iPod. First of all it's bulky and relatively heavy, and there's no locking mechanism, so it fits loosely in the iPod interface and it tends to fall out easily and frequently when picking up my iPod. My biggest concern is that it appears to be bending my iPod's interface while connected, which will in turn bend the PCB inside of the iPod and can drastically reduce the life of an iPod as it will eventually cause connections to come loose."
1,Not for iPhone 3GS,"I am sure this works great for ipods, but it does not work for the new iPhone 3GS. I hooked it up to my home stereo and no sound. After I jiggled the connection for a bit it worked, but who wants to do that each time. Also, the plug will not attach to the iPhone if you have a protective case because the plug it too fat. Of course your charger plug works fine because it is thinner. Now I need to find out if the mini will work."
2,Could Be Perfect,I have two older Sendstation Docks and they have a little extender neck that makes it reach into an ipod or phone that is in a case--this one doesn't have this little extender so it will not reach into the plug with a case making it useless to me as I'm not taking the case off every time. I wrote the mfg to try to find the old one but no response. Otherwise this thing rocks with the best sound coming out line level.
2,"Great Idea, cheaply made.","I was so excited to find this for my iPod touch since my headphone jack doesn't work anymore this would be the prefect fix so I can listen to it in my car again. Well the product works and very well. However it is VERY flimsy, especially when you plug it into the bottom of an iPod. I was afraid it would damage my iPod because it wiggles and is just very unstable. It never hurt anything, but it did just fall apart. There are three pieces that make this device up, the front and back covers (which are held together by two little points of glue and plastics) and the rest of the insides are just one piece. I tried to put it back together with little success. I was so disappointed with this. If only the casing was more solid it would be wonderful and worth five solid stars. As is, this device is only made to dash your hopes and fall to pieces."
2,Line out DOES NOT give better sound quality with Nano,"I tried using this dock with my 1st generation Nano. I found absolutely no difference when connected to the headphone jack or the PocketDock line out. I tried this with a car stereo which has a aux input jack as well as a home amplifier Yamaha HTR 5550.Other than this, the product is definitely of good build quality. Only wish the line out worked as advertised."
1,Do not buy this for your car,"The PocketDock is much thicker than the standard plugs and it does not have a locking catch mechanism.So, if your ipod is in a case with a cut out for a standard plug, you need to remove your case to use the PocketDock.If you have not case, your iPod can easily become unplugged from the PocketDock because the plug does not lock.Lastly, the plug offers a USB LineOut, presumeably to power your iPod but in most cars there is noise from the cigarette lighter that affects the line out in the PocketDock.My solution, charge the iPod in the car and use the headphone jack line out, but only when the battery is dangerously low. In general I use the PocketDock because the sound from the other end is so, so, so, so much better.The PocketDock would be a good device, if it 1. Where thinner, 2. Had a locking mechanism, and 3. Integrated a clean power filter from Car Cigarette lighters."
5,"Bought one as a replacement part, couldn't be happier.","Definitely an improvement on the model included with the professional series mixers. I ended up purchasing this due to the attachments on my mixer going through the dishwasher (oops); I was pleasantly surprised that, in addition to being exactly what I needed (a replacement whisk) that the shape and design of this whisk was a great upgrade. Despite the size, it does a fine job whipping even small quantities of cream (or anything else you throw at it), and doesn't slow down with bowl-filling monstrosities.I'm not convinced it's worth buying just as an upgrade to the OEM whisk, but as a spare or replacement, the piece is top-notch."
1,Big Mistake,Too big for my 5 quart mixer even though it stated it should work on that size when I ordered it. Very disappointed
2,NOT for making bread or cookies!,"All the dough gets stuck in the center. If you like doing dough for bread or cookies, get the 6-wire model."
5,magic tool,"This tool incorporates air quickly into your product, so cakes rise taller, stay fluffy and moist. Batters of all types are silky smooth - and whipped potatoes and frosting are so light and creamy - i could go on forever but the point is when you have a Great tool like this stand mixer use all the attachments to get maximum results - enhance the quality of your foods - once you begin using it you will not go back."
4,Works good but not much visible difference,I whipped eggs with both whips and didn't see much of a difference. Perhaps with other recipies it will make a difference.
4,n-secure,"I enjoyed this movie story line, but for a blu-ray, the color was not that good.It was worth the price to add to my collection of black movies."
3,Interesting movie...what a villain!,"This movie was interesting in a good way. I wouldn't watch it again (the acting wasn't as great as I expected since these people are seasoned actors), but the plot was definitely good. I like that it wasn't entirely predictable. There were a few surprises in there. The main character was...wow! He was crazy, but entertaining, the epitome of a villain. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes dramatic movies with a strong villain character."
1,"If you like Tyler Perry films, you'll love this.","I can't believe folks are giving this movie five stars. This movie has the typical Tyler Perry plot, lots of D list actors and some seriously bad acting i.e crying without tears, long pauses between lines. There is a pointless cameo from Bernadette Stanis from the TV show Good Times; love her but hate that she is forced to appear in this crap for the dough. Also, obnoxious Nephew Tommy appears in few scenes wearing cheap, polyester suits from his uncle's clothing line. If you are looking for good laugh, borrow from the library like I did."
1,Typical Tyler Perry Movie,"In all honesty this is a decent well made movie, but the hidden agenda is the reason for the one star. You see I probably should have known from the jump after I saw that the lead character was in one of Tyler Perry's plays. I'm a straight man and if there is one thing I don't like is when homosexuals make straight movies and slide their agenda to normalize their way of life into the world. I mean what was the real purpose of the main character saying ""I'd rather a man stick his d*** in my mouth rather than in my woman"". One of the most sickening lines that I've heard in a movie and also one of the worst! It had no relevance to the movie we already knew how crazy he was. But this type of stuff is what you get when down low brothas and homosexuals get together and make a movie. Just real talk, I know that I will get haters..."
1,terrible,"This was the worst acting that I have ever seen. I can't believe that this made it to the big screen, or any screen!!!"
3,B grade at best,"This is not a great movie, the script, the acting, definitely B grade. It is predictable and honestly unless your desperate and hard up for something to watch,don't waste you money on this."
3,It Does Not Matter What He Buys You. How Is He Treating You?,"David Washington (Cordell Moore) is an intelligent man, but emotionally damaged -and I mean he is twisted, really messed up. He has no respect for women, he's obsessed with time, he's selfish and downright evil. It's clear where his issues started and all I could do was shake my head at how that person had damaged him.I decided to watch this movie because Tempestt Bledsoe (Jill - my favorite character), Essence Atkins (Robin) and Denise Boutte (Tina) have parts. It was nice to find out Elise Neal (Leslie) and Bernadette Stanis (Dr. Heather) were also in it, because I haven't seen them in a while. N- Secure was difficult to watch to the end, but I had to see what happened with David and what choice Jill (Tempestt Bledsoe) was going to make.Note: There is a bit of profanity and nudity."
4,N-Secure,I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE IT WILL KEEP YOU GUESSING. THE PLOT WAS GOOD. IT'S TOO BAD IT DIDN'T GET MUCH PRAISE WHEN IT WAS AT THE THEATERS WHEN IT CAME OUT. I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.
2,OVERPRICED,Item looks good on wall but does not have the greatest sound quality and seems to be a bit cheaply built. For the money I would get a nice shelf unit.
1,"I bought two, neither one of them worked well.","I own a solan and wanted to mount these on the wall for the massage therapist. The first one lit up and looked great but no sound, what good is a stereo with no sound? I had to send it back. The second one sounds good but the CD door keeps opening and will not stay shut. What good is it going to do me if someone is listening to therapeutic music then it suddenly stops becuase the CD door opens and stops playing. Good luck!Amazon electronics suck. If something dosen't work right you should get a full refund, I had to pay for the shipping to have it returned. Lessen learned, always buy electronics from a local store so you can return it without paying for shipping. UPS has $30.00 I have nothing."
3,Loved it first few years~ now in the garbage!,We had this for a few years before it stopped operating.So for a few years it was a 5 star.Now it's a NO star.So I figured 3 was in the middle!! LOL
3,Fine while it lasted,"I had this for a little over a year but didn't use it all that much. Now the CD door keeps opening automatically and won't play CDs. Other than that huge problem, I have no specific complaints about performance."
2,nice but not compatable with ipod,"Got this as gift for my daughter-hoping she can use it with her ipod, but only mp3's can be attached. So, I put it in living room in a shelf, but it needs more head room as the cd slides up to open.didn't do all the homework:D"
1,"Poor quality, waste of money.","I have used this product for only a few months and it has already stopped working normally. The motor doesn't have enough power to pull/down the door for add/remove CD's from it.Was cool looking when it was working, over time it will just be a paper weight.Also the sound was very low quality and the remote is difficult to use (yes that's true!).A large majority of Philips/Magnavox products are crappy quality and poor warranty support. Stay away!"
1,JUNK! Stopped working after 1 week.,"Can I give a 0 Star? A piece of Junk, stopped working after 1 week!"
3,Okay System,This sound on this system is average. Good system for kids rooms. Note that the clock doesn't light up. We hoped to replace the kids' clock radios but are now in a bind b/c they can't see the time in the dark. USB connection works great with our Creative Zen Nanos.
3,Not Convenient,"This product was purchased for me as a birthday present. The overall look of the system is very eye pleasing. The sound is great. There are however two things I do not like about this system. 1. The clock does not stay lit; the system actually turns off completely when powered down. 2. Trying to find the adapters to play your IPOD are ridiculously difficult. I can't play any ""protected"" songs without the adapter and it's VERY hard to find the adapter. Seems like basically a waste. Had I known, I would have probably returned it. Requirements for attachments should be posted on the BOX!"
2,Beware of this video!,"I'm an avid Lone Ranger fan! This video contains two episodes: ""Old Joe's Sister"" and ""The Renegades."" The film is extremely poor quality (it was so dark that at times I had a hard time seeing everything), and some scenes were even edited out. You can find both episodes on other tapes that are much better quality and that contain the whole episodes. Any fan of the Lone Ranger will want to get better quality Lone Ranger videos than this one!"
5,Body (Reach Out) - Faith Trent,"US CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""BODY (REACH OUT)"" - FAITH TRENT1) Radio Edit - 3:582) Widelife Club Mix - 10:163) Hard Attack's Vocal Workout - 7:204) Hard Attack's Darktribe Mix - 6:305) Widelife Dub - 8:002002"
4,Lullaby Themes for Sleepy Dreams,"I got this CD for my kids who are 2 1/2 and 4 1/2. They wanted to listen to only a couple of songs in this album. So I would have to play only those songs in the repeat mode. Whether they enjoyed all the songs or not, it did help them to go to sleep without me being around."
5,Enchanting lullabies with an amazing calming effect!,"There is something so soothing and sweet sounding - and yet distinctly elegant - about Susie Tallman's voice. I bought this CD because I was 6 months pregnant with my first baby and wanted a good lullaby CD to help calm my baby-to-be. However, after listening to it for the first time, I found that the first thing I did when I got home after a long, stressful day at work was play Ms. Tallman's CD! Ms. Tallman's soprano voice is truly beautiful and wonderfully soothing. I love the diverse selection of lullabies each with their own distinct theme and sound so that you never get bored listening to them! It calms BOTH mother and child! The magic of Ms. Tallman's sweet sounding melodies will have a powerful effect on calming your baby. You will be amazed!"
5,Worth the wait !,"After perchance seeing Susie Tallman perform at her friends wedding in LA some years ago .. I have been almost mystified as to why it had taken so long for us to hear this most angelic voice ! It wasnt until a recent performance of the San Francisco Philharmonic that I spotted her again in the choir .. Now that Ive heard this CD, I can only delight in telling you that Susie's voice and interpretation is amazing .. I hope Susie can make us adults happy too and record a selection of songs so her truly remarkable talents are heard across the age spectrum ! Great to finally hear from you Susie .. Best of Luck from Down-Under .."
2,Voice isn't soothing,"I agree with a couple others here that Susie Tallman's very ""pop"" style vocals are not appropriate for soothing lullaby music. In fact I find her voice over-stimulating. I bought the cd based on positive reviews for being soothing lullabies so I was really surprised when I heard the music!"
2,Not the worst I've heard,The woman's voice is slightly irritating and the songs don't flow well with each other when you play the whole cd through
4,POOH'S PARTY BETTER FOR YOUNGER KIDS,"THIS IS A CUTE GAME, BUT IT GET'S A LITTLE TOO HARD FOR A PRESCHOOLER AFTER THE FIRST FEW LEVELS. POOH'S PARTY IS EASIER FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN."
4,A good choice for younger children,"My children really enjoy this game. Both kids are still mastering the technicalities of playstation games. My six year old adores this game. My three year old has difficulty with the jumping, as the types of jumping increase in difficulty as the game progresses. I too had fun sitting down and playing this game, but when I reached the end of the game it was almost anti-climatic... it just lets you replay levels for a better time. My daughter has not reached the end yet, and she thinks it is good fun. This is another game that is fun for beginners, although I doubt that more advanced children would want to play it after the first month... it is not that difficult to master if you know how to maneuver the controls."
4,"Farmerzdtr, I think you're mistaken","I've been searching for the chupacabra story for some time, but I think you're mistaken that it's on the ghost set. If you know where it is, I'd love to know. Thanks.Anyway, these are great, great stories, but I can name a few that are missing, like the great one about the carnival attraction that had a real ice man/caveman in it."
5,I know where the Chupacabra is!,"For Jeff Carter and ""Karen"" -- Just wanted to let you know, the Chupacabra story is on another Unsolved Mysteries DVD, I think ""Ghosts"" -- my son has it, and we watched it just last week.If it's on a different Unsolved DVD that he has, I will come back and edit this. Hope this helps!These are all GREAT stories!"
5,The Greatest DVD Set ever Made,"This is, in my opinion, The Greatest DVD Set ever made.I have a lot of documentary on DVD. From Cities of the Underworld to almost anything made by the history channel I have a lot of DVDs about History, True Crimes and the Paranormal. After all these years and countless Hours spent in front of the TV I think my Unsolved Mysteries DVDs are still my favorites.I bought this set 4 years ago and I still watch it all the time. There's so many incredible, amazing segments on this set: Amelia Earhart, Alcatraz, John Wilkes Booth, Bigfoot, The Yeti, Huey Long, Martin Luther King, Who killed Bugsy, The Butcher of Kingsbury Run, The Death of Elvis, Mothman, The Skunk Ape, Sonny Liston, Billy The kid, the Death of George Reeves, Noah's Ark, The Holy Grail, B.C.'s Sea Monster, Anastasia, The Bermuda Triangle...So many great investigations, so many great mysteries on one DVD Set. Amazing.This will always be my favorite DVD set."
5,Unsolved Mysteries Fan,"In addition to all the other reviews I have read, I am so glad I stumbled across this collection. I had no idea unsolved mysteries were on DVD. These DVDs are highly recommended for Unsolved Mysteries fans. It brought back memories of watching these classics in the early 90's with robert stack. Great buy!"
5,A Perfect Box of Mystery,"This show is excellent, the two shows that made the 90s conspiracy filled and kept us glued to the TV set at night are, ""Unsolved Mysteries"" & ""The X-Files"" both dealt with supernatural, murders & of course UFO's. The two theme songs from theses shows are my two favorite themes of all time, brilliantly spine tingling, I knew when I heard these two songs I was going to be drawn into a hour long mystery with suspense & many questions with very few answers. If you adore this show, then you must own the DVD's, as they seem to take you back in time, and frightened, but in a good way. Also noted that on the box of the ""Strange Legends"" Abraham Lincoln looks a lot like Robert Stack especially in the eyes."
4,No frills,Good back to the basics sci-fi with a basic and just simple story. None of the gory stuff that sci-fi seems to be picking up from horror. Likable characters. Not a romance person but thought relationship in story was handled okay. Good story (a little wordy in description sometimes)--two of the main characters are women in their forties. Aliens they encounter are human looking but with unnatural powers. Good sci-fi to read.
3,Good But Masterpiece Coming,"Creative Story - Unedited (some quirky stuff and long sentences) but shortened version from author (in own words)about relationships that develops between two Florida minority women-- friends--and human looking aliens (follows interracial theme from The Bonus). Good book to read if you want to see author's original thoughts/words and good book after author's first unedited book The Bonus (loved The Bonus more!!). Edited long version with both books in one coming out. And told the main characters do more than ""handshake"" in the revised one. ""The Bonus and Sister Planet Tara: The Complete American Stories-Edited"" by same author s'pose to be out by end of September 2002 with reason behind this unedited unpublicized edition first and both interracial stories in one book."
2,shirts some fit some dont,good quality shirt but these dont fit tight around neck like normal so i gave 2 stars thats it buddy
3,A bunch of press releases,"While a great tool for the law student obsessed with prestige (and aren't we all?), take the writeups with a grain of salt. It does provide great insights into the recent high profile cases handled by the firms, as well as some episodes that the firms would probably rather forget.Overall though, it reads like typical locker room bragging - just about every firm claims that they let noone but Supreme Court clerks and EICs of the Harvard or Yale Law Reviews through the doors."
3,Has a major problem,"This case is of decent quality construction and looks fine - but there is 1 problem with it. Part of the clear plastic over the keypad stretches around the side to connect to the leather - and in one place, this plastic overlaps the down-volume button, which can cause you to inadvertently turn down the volume as the case moves around on your hip.Also, be aware there is no plastic protecting the inside screen (which could be good for you if you don't like plastic over the main screen.)"
5,A forgotten classic,"This album came out about the same time as Magic Sam's ""West Side Soul"" and offers a rare snapshot of the blues scene from which he emerged. Eddie Shaw stands out with a haunting sax tune ""Blues for the West Side"". A must for lovers of the local urban blues scene in Chicago un the late 60's that was over shadowed by the revival movements popularized by British blues rock musicians and folk rockers."
5,Amazing and Captivating,"When i first found this book, I bought it because the description was eye-catching and it was only $1 in this half-price book store. And it was the best dollar I could spend on a book. The night I bought it, I could not stop reading. I felt this connection to Toby. I am not personally homosexual, but despite sexual preferences, I feel that anyone could relate to Toby and his struggles with his love, life and friends. It's not just about being gay. It's about being young, in love, being crazy, being confused as hell. Anyone could relate to it. The way the books can vary from being happy and joking to where you think you'll smile all night to being a huge tear-jerker, making you cry like a baby. If you were young, you'd know how Toby feels. If you have ever been in love and been hurt, you'll know what Toby is going through. If you've ever been confused.. you'll be by Toby Sligh's side."
1,Five Stars? Please,"This is one of the worst books I've read in years (and I've reviewed books for a living, so I read A LOT of bad books). I can only assume these other reviews are friends of the author. Either that, or there's simply no accounting for taste..."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I bought this novel on a whim and was severly disappointed. The cover includes a quote by Armistead Maupin saying something along the lines of ""you won't be able to put it down."" And he was right, I couldn't put it down. I just hoped that Vilmure would vindicate himself. The plot was hard to follow, the characters poorly developed and there were several situations that remained unexplained. All in all, this book is a waste of time, unless you're self-destructive, which case you'll love this book."
1,an insult to the reader's intelligence,"I was sick in bed this weekend and decided to have another look at ""Toby's Lie""-- what an outlandish, poorly plotted excuse for a novel. It's as if the author didn't read through the manuscript a second time-- the narrative is just totally incoherent, and the dialogue is terrible. It's fevered and overwrought, and while such a tone jives with my memories of my first homosexual l-u-v in high school, there is no ironic distance between the author and narrator, and I was left with the suspicion that Vilmure must be as silly and self-dramatizing as his protagonist. There are far better books about the adolescent homosexual experience out there. Buy one of them instead."
5,Very Intresting Thoughts On American History,"I have to say that this edition of ""What If?"" does make you think, especially about what could have happened regarding the history of the U.S. had things gone a diffrent way.I've found a lot of the senarios presented in this book(particularly the ones on Pearl Harbor, Joe McCarthy and JFK) to be fasciniting and it really does make you think and look back.I would definitely recommend this book to any fan of history."
3,highly uneven,"Some of the counterfactuals (especially the Civil War ones) were quite informative and/or entertaining; they explained why small changes in history would have mattered, and created vivid alternative histories.Others were so vague and speculative as to be uninteresting; for example, the essay on the 1960 U-2 incident suggests that the Cold War would have somehow ended earlier had it not occurred. However, the author fails to explain why the detente between a lame-duck President Eisenhower (then in his last year of office) and Khruschev would have been more durable or historically important than the detente of the 1970s between Nixon and Breshnev."
4,Clever Counterfactuals,"Here we have a third collection of fascinating counterfactuals (alternate histories). This collection focuses on the United States, and the only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is that two of the submissions were published several years ago in What If # 1. Surely there is more than enough material available to make up a full volume on the US without resorting to repetition!Even with the duplicate essays, this is an absorbing volume. My favorite selection has to be the next to last one, a look back at the two day nuclear war of October 1962 from a ten year perspective. It is completely believable and disturbing in light of recent US disregard of international opinion. (One hopes certain members of the Bush Administration will receive this book as a holiday gift this year!) I trust there will be yet further What Ifs to come."
5,What Ifs? never cease to amaze me.,"Finally! A What Ifs? book focused on American History. The other books in the series were descriptive and concise, answering many questions I myself have wondered about the events that have shaped the world as it is today, so it was no surprise that this one followed through. Reading this truly makes one realize the immense impact every single event in history has on our world today. Five stars, without a doubt."
1,Very boring; returned the book after one day,"A family member gave me this book, knowing that I was a fan of American history and ""what ifs"" of all varieties. I've never been a fan of the ultimately ahistorical Harry Turtledove-style novels, and I was interested in reading some alternative history that was a little more academic in scope. That said, this book was horribly boring. I'm not a light reader - just look at my other reviews - but I couldn't even begin to get into this book. Nothing interested me in the least, and after giving the book a try for less than twenty-four hours, I finally had to just take it back. It is one of only two books I've ever returned - that's how brainsuckingly uninteresting it was."
3,a collection of twist of events,"An interesting collection of historic events that would have happened differently if some element did not happen. I cannot say that this book was great reading because some of the stories, I felt, were boring. Some provided so much detail that they left me yearning for something written differently."
3,Mediocre at best,"Nothing here to get ecited about. It was okay, but does not measure up to other writers of thie genre."
4,Good Clock Radio for Kids,"My [...] had broken her last alarm clock and this AM/FM Digital Radio (w/ dual alarms) was $8 w/ free shipping so I couldn't pass on it. It was easy to set up, the radio works well enough (though the speaker is what you'd expect) and the LEDs are large and bright. The alarm tone is controllable and you can wake up to music or tone."
4,alarm buzz...,"The buzz/tone function is unbeilivably loud, which is very annoying in the morning. Luckily, you can also wake up to the radio. Other than that, this is a great alarm clock for the price."
3,Decent Game,"This game is not like the old rock em sock em robots. It's set in the future, and allows you to compete in fights in a 3-D ring with other robots. You can knock off your oppenents parts and if you win you get to keep them. You can earn cash through matches to buy parts to upgrade your robot. There are 14 robots and there is also a 2 player mode. This game is fair and would appeal more to a younger crowd. If you really want a good customizeable robot game check out the armored core series for the PS1 and PS2."
4,Awesome book,"I read this after reading Grass, and was pleased to note a couple of familiar names and faces. Personally, this is one of my favorite of Ms. Tepper's works, and the commentary on religion and tolerance amidst various barbaric practices in this book make it a worthwhile read.This book would have achieved 5 stars if it wasn't for the Tepper-style deuz ex machina that I have come to expect from her books. This one wasn't as obvious or contrived as some of her other books (Family Tree, The Visitor, Gibbon's Decline and Fall) and it was a bit of a letdown, but the ending was better than some of her other books, so a solid 4/5 stars."
2,"Very dark, disturbing, and violent","I am Tepper's most avid fan, and, as such, I guess there must be one book that is my least favorite. This one is it. It is very dark and violent and it is the only one of her books that I could not read more than once. This is a great author. If you want to read her work, please do not start with this book. I highly recommend her ""Beauty,"" ""Grass,"" ""Raising the Stones,"" ""Family Tree,"" ""Gibbons Decline and Fall,"" and the entire True Game series."
2,A disappointment to an avid Tepper fan,"I am a great fan of Tepper, I own and have read all of her books. Unfortunately this book struck me as repetitive in the resolution of the characters, especially Owldark. I read for pleasure as well as to learn, this book was so dark and uncomfortable that I did neither.While the story was well crafted, I didn't like any of the characters and could not make an investment in their stories. The creativity and ingenuity of the plot may however be enough for other readers."
2,Missed the mark,"Very slow to get started and grab me, I liked the middle but the end just fell flat for me. I had to force myself to finish the end which I found very unsatisfying."
2,A MUDDLED MESS,"I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS BOOK. I LOVED ALL OF THE OTHER TEPPER BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ. UNFORTUNATELY, I HAD TROUBLE FOLLOWING THE PLOT TO THIS ONE. I WAS SO CONFUSED THAT I HAD TO START OVER HALFWAY THRU. BELIEVE ME IT WAS NO MORE PLAIN THE SECOND TIME AROUND. THE ONE THING THAT REALLY STANDS OUT IN MY MIND IS THE CENTRAL THEME. IT IS TRULY AN UNIVERSAL QUESTION: WHY ARE WE HERE?"
1,Not American Made-Bad Lids,I purchased this set at a local retailer. Proudly displayed on the box is an American flag stating its country of manufacture. After removing the packaging and washing the bowls and lids I noticed that the lids are clearly marked as being made in China. I stored the bowls with the lids attached. When I went to use them the next day I saw that two of the lids had cleanly split from the edge toward the center. This renders them useless. The bowls them self are nice but only one star for the deceptive packaging and miserable quality of the lids. Corporate greed is destroying American manufacturing. Don't stand for it.
5,Wonderful!,"These are great mixing bowls, serving bowls, storage bowls and whatever else you need them for. They are nice and heavy which is great because they don't break easily. Mine have lasted through a move in which I made the mistake of letting my husband pack up the kitchen. Lets just say they could have been wrapped better. The lids are genius and are actually tight-fitted. I had trouble getting one of them on the first time but once it's on it's on! They clean up great and I've used them everywhere but the oven. I've even used the bigger one to make whipped cream in. I used a hand mixer and it was fine, not one scratch in the bowl! I put the smaller one in the microwave to melt butter. They are so nice looking you can serve in them also! I recommend them %100!"
1,Never received item. Shipper called to say white boards were broken on route and that they would be returning to manufcturer.,"We are a new school and had been told we would receive the white board by July 21. On July 22 we received a call from the shipper that the board were damaged on route. We never received them. No replacements, no calls and no follow up!Never received a credit for them on our credit card either!WE LATER RECEIVED THEM -- TWO MONTHS LATE. But they gave us upgraded boards, nicer than what we ordered. They were very apologetic and we were pleased with the end result, though we would have much preferred to have received our original order on time."
1,Received Broken,There was a crack down the center of the board when we received it. My boss thought it was too much trouble to try and return so we just kept it. The crack bothers me.
4,Okay for long term planning,"Received a call from the delivery company the next day and set an appointment for delivery the following day, great delivery service. The Melamine surface takes some elbow grease to scrub off the the dry-erase marks and leaves shadows, you will definitely need to have some spray cleaner handy. Wasn't expecting it but also didn't see it listed anywhere, this board is NOT MAGNETIC for those that were wondering. We are using the board for long term planning and works fine for that but would not want to practice math or repetitive problems on it since it does not erase fully without alot of work and/or spray cleaner."
5,What I wanted,"This whiteboard is wonderful. It arrived promptly, and the staff was wonderful. It was delivered when I was not around, so they contacted me to make sure that everything was in order. It comes with the items that you need to hang it (I chose to use larger supports because I have cement walls). I use it constantly. I will say that my markers are staining it, but they do the same on my other white board. It cleans well with cleaning solution."
4,Price/performance is good,"I am neither happy nor unhappy about this board. The board itself does not give a comforting feeling in some way. It is not metal but a mere melamine coating on a plywood. However, the $100 price is great for such a product."
2,Arrived Damaged,"1st one arrived damaged. Amazon replaced with an undamaged board. The undamaged board works well. We have had many issues ordering this size board, so I would suggest you purchase them from a local store unless you enjoy inspecting your purchase, finding damage & sending it back."
1,Terrible product & customer service,"If you value your money, please don't purchase ANY products from restock it! The whiteboard i purchased showed up crushed on both sides in pathetic packaging. Multiple attempts to contact their returns department hasn't resulted in any response. If you value your money i would spend it on an alternate/reliable vendor. Their customer service is literally non-existent. Will never buy anything from these jokers!"
2,Very thin,"If you look at the prices for whiteboards, they are all generally overpriced (IMHO). When I found this deal on Amazon, it seemed like a great deal. We received the item however upon arrival it was totally bent. The product had a large crease on the surface of the writing area making it unacceptable. We have purchased other whiteboards in the past and in comparison, this one lacks a magnetic surface and is much lighter and thinner too. Overall it's hard to judge the surface quality since the item was returned. Now I'm back to looking for a higher quality alternative."
4,Very good purchase,"The white board is really good, was delivered earlier than expected, and is exactly what was hoped for. It is light and was easy to hang, it is stable for writing and erasing. Good purchase for the price. Recommend to anyone seeking to think critically."
3,Not the best quality,"First of all, the delivery ended up being more expensive then the product.Second, the quality was not the best, I relized later I could have made a better deal in a local store.The positive thing: The delivery was fast (within few days)"
3,Odd,"The writing is odd, the tales are odder. Odder still, I enjoyed the book and even laughed at the plausibility of some of the stories. The author chronicles paranormal interactions in government areas. Perfect for the ""Art Bell"" friend!"
1,"Poor Quality, 10lbs too light","This is the only item I have every bought off Amazon that has had a problem with it. I ordered 2 of these barbells for my gym this week and when I received them they looked awful and when I weighed them they weighed 35.6 lbs, not 45 like described. The sleeves on the end of the barbell were very loose and the bearings that are supposed to rotate freely, barely rotated at all. When I called them they did not offer me anything to make this right and just told me to return the item. I would suggest not buying anything from this company."
5,Awesome,"Bought this for my home gym and I am pleased, it is very solid sturdy and built to last. Though one warning, use gloves or you will get a LOT of calluses from this thing. Wish it came in different colors just for the heck of it, though ultimately I would have stuck with the default anyway."
5,The hardback is preferable,"Having lost an older copy of this wonderfully illustrated book, I ordered the paperback, only to be disapointed by the xerox quality of the drawings. This book deserves the hardbound format because the artwork is exceptionally authentic. The poorly copied paperback is not worthy."
5,Amazing,"Martha Wells continues to be the best fantasy writer out there. It's too bad this book is no longer in print - not just because it is such an amazing book, but because I won't let anyone borrow mine for fear they lose it and I could never find another one. The book describes Thomas, the perfect action hero. A great fighter, brave... Although this type of hero is found in almost every book, only Martha Wells can get the reader to truly like him and admire his abilities. Also Kade, one of the better female heroines in any book, helps set the stage for witty dialogue and well fought battles with the fay. This book also sets up ""The Death of a Necromancer"" which is also worth reading. If you can find a copy of this for an affordable price, buy it immediately."
4,"Thrilling, Swashbucking, Arthurian Fun","I have nearly finished rereading this book, after having read it once about 5 years ago. I had remembered it as being pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Impressive is the word that I would use now. Martha Wells must have a wide knowledge of both Arthurian legend and traditional Celtic mythology because she combines them skilfully in an unusual and interesting way in this book. What I liked most about it was that though it is a traditional Arthurian style fantasy (king, fay half-sister, unfaithful queen, etc.) Wells made it into her own story with the addition of Thomas Boniface, sardonic Queen's Guard, and his romance with Kade Carrion, the fay half-sister. Why not 5 stars? Mainly because I didn't like very many of the characters--they were all very well drawn, but only a few were sympathetic. If you don't like cliches, don't read this book, but if you can appreciate new, humorous, intelligent reinterpretations of cliches, read on!"
4,It was hard to put down,"Very well written. Some part were hard to follow, but maybe it was because I was reading so fast. I really enjoyed it. Kade was my favorite character."
3,Good novel,"This novel really ranks 3.5 . This is the first novel I've read by Martha Wells, and, coincidentally, it was her debut novel. The story was very good, the charcters well developed. Where it fell down from a 4 or 4.5 star novel for me was that at times it was slow, I didn't quite believe the romance in the story (came out of nowhere...I thought Kade came back for an actual object, not a person) and the villain's point of view wasn't addressed until almost 3/4 of the way through the book. I will definitely be reading other works by this author."
2,This book was different than what I expected!,"With the sub-title being, 'Practical steps to put the messie lifestyle behind you', I thought this book would be filled with organization tips. Instead, it goes into quite a bit of detail (including religion) about why one is messie. It does not include anything to do about it. If you are looking for a book to discover why you are messie, it is good. If you are looking for practical, hands-on tips for doing something about being messie, this book is not for you."
5,For those who need some home organization.,Written with wit and humor. Fun ways to get organized and stay that way. Gets you motivated and helps you stay that way.
2,Keep Trying Disney,"My kids love Pooh and Tigger and I love the freedom from the Punch, Kill, Destroy.... BUT someone wasn't thinking when they made a video game for 2-4 year olds that requires the reading of subtitles to understand the game completely. I think the game is a great idea but next time Disney should have the moms of the age group and the age group themselves give some input before they produce it... Keep trying Disney...However they did succeed with the Tarzan video game where one of the characters verbally explains game tips."
4,Great for Preschoolers,"I rented this game for my 4 year old son. At first he wanted to watch me play, and then he went to town and got through about three levels. This is the first time he has actually played a game like this without just watching. The ""Pooh Sticks Bridge"" and ""Paper, scissors, stone"" games on it are fun too and easy to understand. Tigger is absolutely adorable!"
2,Too easy for a five year old,"Fine for small preschoolers but much too easy for my 5 year old. He breezed through it in about 5 hrs. He is not a video game fanatic so it was surprising. After playing again with him, it is very, very easy. Once again, great starter game for very young but that's it. ..."
3,Disney Presents Tigger's Honey Hunt,"It was a disappointment - the words that the characters were supposedly speaking, we could only read...their mouths were moving but no sound (except for the usual ""Ta-Ta for now!""). We would have it enjoyed the game so much more..."
3,Not too engaging,"Got this game for my 3 and 5 yr old to play on the N64. All the other games were just so challenging for them, so I got this in hopes of them being able to actually play and not just tell you everything that they want to do. It's not to bad except for the fact that it's not a story like game that plays out, which I thought that it would be that way like the other pooh type games from disney. Not only that but the little ones played it for a few days when it was new and went back to the more challenging games instead. This game actually is one of their last choices. It's really just not very engaging for them. It would probably have been better to have bought one of the elmo games where they would at least be learning numbers or ABC's vs just wasting away their time."
1,Terrible,"I got this Totally PATHETIC game for my little sis for Christmas. She's four and she loves Tigger and Winnie the Pooh. Well, that was on TV. On Nintendo 64, it is HORRIBLE. They talk and you can't even hear them. The words come up on a caption. What do they think, 3 and 4 year olds can read captions? They have trouble with the controllers too. I played it once and it was so bad that if it was a little worse, I probably would have made it never work again. HAHA!Dont waste your money."
3,Pretty good but not good 4 kids unda 7,this game looks purrty pleezin but 4 kids unda 6 or 7 its not da best. my lil bro iz still stuck on this 1 jump and hes been stuck on it since like aug. or sept. if any1 is a pretty good video game player then this is a good game 4 u. mi hermano es just a beginner
1,Beware!,"I ordered this item from Electrogalaxy through Amazon.com and received a 110 volt power cable. I'm not sure what it would fit.Electrogalaxy did not respond to my emails as to getting the right product or determining if the description is wrong. Instead they refunded my purchase, minus the $8 it cost to ship it back to them. This is their stated policy so if you can't trust them to send the right product, don't buy from them.In short, I'm $8 in the hole with nothing to show for it, other than the knowledge to not buy from this company.I would recommend you email the company before purchasing this item to verify what you are getting."
2,"What can you say? It's a power adapter, gotta have it, and they know it!","Works fine with my Vista HCx, just way overpriced!But, it allows the use of the GPS in the car without using your batteries, and is great for turning up the brightness, as others have noted.Garmin really does need to think some things through however. Both their AC and DC adapters are just that, adapters. The Vista HCx GPS I use accepts rechargeable batteries, but neither of their adapters are designed to charge batteries, but only to supply voltage to operate?! Kind of short-sighted on their part.Good product, but I'm deducting points for price, and being unable to function as a charger."
1,Use caution with this item,"I have two of these things. When used with a car lighter outlet, they cause my Legend Cx to overheat. When used with a true 12v. power source, they work fine. Most cars actually run at about 13.6 to 14 volts instead of 12. Garmin is trying hard to help me resolve this, but in the meantime, be aware that certain units may experience problems with this system."
1,faulty adapter,"If you have Garmin Legend GPS, do not buy this adapter. I purchased it, used it in the truck and every time you turn off and turn on the engine, it will damage GPS. I had my GPS replaced 3 times.I purchased newer Legend HCx and got it damaged by adapter also. After replacement, I simply use standard cellphone cigarette adapter and haven't had any problem at all."
4,Good Accessory,"Works as advertised on my 60Cx, I was wondering after reading a review that it didn't, it does. Using on a motorcycle so I wouldn't go for the USB power because it seems like it will create a weatherproof seal whereas the USB won't. It's a must have for me. 4 stars because of the price, yes it's steep."
2,nothing special,Bought this for a garmin etrex GPS. There is nothing special about this product. It has a standard USB connection. Save yourself $10 and pick one up at your local store.
5,Another K&N,Works like it should.A replacement air filter is 30 bucks so why not save some money and gain some performance.
3,K&N Filter,"I've tried AC,Purelator and the K&N filter, AC filter gets the best gas mileage of all of them. As far as filtering, the K&N does what it's supposed to do, filter incomeing air."
5,desires blossom,the book was very interesting i had a very hard time putting it down.i would take the book where every i went.after reading one chapter it made you want to keep reading on . now i have book stores calling me when any of cassie edwards books come in ..
5,Esoteric Christianity,"This book is a revolutionary and inspiring document. Barbara Marx Hubbard decodes the biblical Book of Revelation to reveal a message for our times encrypted in its pages, a message that stimulates us to leap beyond our limited ways of thinking to a new level of power and purpose. She reveals our true nature, as co-creators with the forces of life itself, using the model of Jesus, the ""future human."" She shows that while the multiple, converging crises our planet is going through may appear meaningless, painful and confusing, they are simply birth pains. A new state of conciousness is being born, reordering the future of our species and the very cells of our bodies. Open this book at any page and read - and you will be swept into a life-changing new awareness of your own birthright and the potential of every human being. -from book's back cover"
5,Forbes Masson - the bloke's a genius,"Great to have the chance to see this fabulous show again. Yes, Alan Cumming is great (as are the other co-stars) but the mega individual of this series is Forbes Masson - his fabulous writing and songsmithery are unbeatable. Altogether this series is fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!"
2,Dearth of color photos,"I bought this book as a gift for a gardening enthusiast and was very disappointed in it. Compared to other garden treatises of similar size, price, and level of specificity, there were simply far too few color photos in this book. There are some color photos, but the vast majority of the book is in black and white. The scientific descriptions and technical specificity are great, though. Overall, the book is very overpriced for what you get."
1,"Good idea, bad result","This kind of books need pictures in full color, specially for the peple who are not experts on the subject"
2,Don't be misled this book has no color pictures.,"I haven't started to read book yet, but purchased it to study the pictures. However all the pictures are black and white/ the foreword states it has a ""large number of color plates"". The only colored picture is the front and back cover of the book. Poor value for a $50 book."
3,Necessary for making RPMS. Getting obsolete.,"The other reviewers' negative comments are mostly on track. The book is not all that well organized. It is an absolute necessity if you are going to develop RPMs, however. The man pages are really incomplete, so you need the book to do what the man pages should have done. The book provides more than man pages would have, since it includes many examples.I find with the latest versions of RPM that the book is getting obsolete. The syntax of the .rpmrc file has changed. Important rpm version variables such as EPOCH are not documented. One must also read the source code to develop RPMS and RPM tools.I would give this book a B+ for when it was originally published, but it only gets a C+ today because it is getting obsolete. Red Hat should produce a 2nd edition and spend a little effort organizing it.At least the current version actually contains much technical information. Let's hope it doesn't degenerate into a non-technical book in some future edition."
1,Obsolete,"This was probably a good book when it came out, but since then rpm has changed significantly. If Redhat would at least publish a consise list of the changes to the commands, I'd change my rating to 3 or 4 stars. As it is, you cannot use this book to diagnose problem in creating spec files or designing high-quality spec files. Until it is revised, you are better off looking at the man pages and how other people have written spec files."
3,Better Proof Reading,The book needed a better proof reader. Words were missing and wrong words used such as it instead of is. It wasn't too bad.
3,Okay if you listened to Waite growing up,"While the book has several factual errors (George Bryson did the Reds TV games starting in the mid fifties not the late fifties; Gene Kelly not Gene Kell as reported replaced Jack Moran in 1962 on radio to name two errors), it is okay if you grew up listening to the Reds. For others it's probably not worth the time. Borrow the book from a library, if you feel that you must read."
2,Watch out on the batteries you use.,Put a larger mA battery and it stop working after a few minutes of use. Save up and go brushless if you want to increase some speed or use better batteries with your Rc.
2,Titan Motor - this is my fourth,"For those buying this as a replacement for the one you got with your original RC purchase, don't expect it to be your last. My experience is that they simply don't last - I am averaging less than 6 hours of use per motor and I am very careful not to overheat the motor or slam it in and out of forward and reverse. Ultimately you start to see them as a day to day running cost and something you cannot rely on. I find it hard to believe that something more robust could not be manufactured albeit at a sighlty higher cost. If you use your vehicle a lot, then you should strongly consider investing in a a brushless system sooner rather than later. I wish I had after the first motor failed."
1,Terrible Motor - Short-lived Titan 12T,"This review is about the Titan 12T 550 motor. I should have listened to the other reviews... This motor does not last. It lasted for 3 days. I drive it hard but I do not abuse it (e.g., I don't slam it into reverse while going full forward). I've since purchased a Losi 12T 550 from Amazon http://www.amazon.com/TEAMLOSI-SCT-Motor/dp/B002GXF1MQ/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1330876982&sr=1-1-fkmr0 ...Wow, that thing runs even faster than the Titan and is lasting :) Although you do have to connect your own wires, I watched a quick youtube video on how to solder and it was easy. STEER CLEAR OF THE TITAN 12T! Nothing against Traxxas, but the Titan itself is terrible."
1,WORST MOTOR,DO NOT BUY THIS MOTOR. IT BURNS OUT QUICK AND IS A WASTE OF $. i WOULD NOT TAKE IT IF IT WAS FREE. I SPEACK FROM EXPERIENCE.
1,"Titan 550, 12t, motor.","I am sorry, this is a bad product, too many hole's on the side's of the motor for rock's and debri to get in and DESTROY the motor, i have went through four of these motor's in four week's, you can get this same motor at Hobbypart'z for $5."
2,"Bought two at a great price, should have bought more!!!!","Bought two, at about 16 bucks each, why not? Burnt the original motor out of my rc truck by being foolish, but for the price, why not take things to the max? Will update if this one burns out.Update 7-6-10. Well, both of them burnt out way too quickly. I hoped to get more at the &16 dollar price, but now they're $25.00 each. I guess I should go brushless."
2,Not durable and long lasting.,This is a great motor only while it is running. It only lasted a few days before it blew out. I think the best thing to do for anyone is to spend the extra money on a brushless system because it will last much longer and it is faster.
1,Low Quality,This motor is already burnt up. I need to find a product that is better quality. Does Anyone know where I can get a better motor? I know my son can't be any harder on an engine then anyone else is. why is it that I have only had this just alittle over a month.
1,Burn't out,I've gotton 3 of these in my life time and haven't got a 1 to last me over 2 weeks. TRAXXAS fails this motor. Don't bother clicking the buy button.
1,Horrible!!!!,"Went thru 2 of them in less than a week,do not buy ,just save yourself the hassle and go brushless.these things are powerful and alot of torque,but wats the point when its only gonna last a couple runs only."
2,Just go brushless,these motors burn out way to quickly. Every one I've had in my traxxas rustler burnt out in about one week. lucky for me traxxas gave me 2 replacement motors for free but they didn't last long. I refused to get another brushed motor after the last one burnt out so I ended up buying the brushless system which costs about $160. It is pretty expensive but in the long run your probably better off getting brushless because it will be cheaper than having to replace the brushed motor every week.
1,JUNK,I have burned up six of this motors and traxxas support told me it was my fault do not buy this motor
1,Short Life,I have had 6 of these over a year and a half spread burnt everyone of them up. Did all breakin required by Traxxas and still went within 5 to 6 runs. The last 2 went after just 4 runs. Save your money and go Brushless. I just did and it was the best money I ever spent RC related.
1,It don't work when I connect them to the battery.,It don't work when I connect them to the battery. It don't work when I connect them to the battery.
2,works great... until it dies in 2 days,just burned out my second one of these motors... they are horrible... if you are looking for a brushed motor go with the dynamite 15 turn. it is just as fast and it will last longer. they work good when they work but the only last a few days. DO NOT BUY God bless
1,3rd motor in 4 months of rare use,"Brushes came lose after 3rd time running. Previous Traxxas motor last about the same. The brushes come loose and the motor never works again. Bought the Traxxas Stampede for son's birthday in September. 1st motor lasted almost till Thanksgiving. It would only run if placed in hot running water. Cleaned it to no avail. Ordered a new one through Amazon for xmas. Got it and thought I better get another just in case. Before xmas break was over I ordered another one. Well within a month and only 3rd battery through the truck the brushes are lose. I think the seller is OK, it is the actual manufacturer and the motor reliability. Some say these motors are warrenteed for life or longer than a month. It may just be more hassle. I am looking for an alternative. The rest of the truck has been great. Just the motor after motor."
2,Done with the 12t after 2,"The first motor lasted through about 4 packs and the second one, with which we were much more careful with during break in, around 6 packs. Just ordered a Castle Creations brushless SCT."
2,Don't Expect Extended Life,"You can baby the motor if you want, but it does not last long enough to enjoy. We switched to VXL.The motor has great power. Its easy to install. Its inexpensive. I thought all of the previous negative reviews were abusers of the motor. I apologize. Don't expect extended life if you purchase this motor."
5,Very good for beginners,"I purchased this book back in 1994 and helped me get in touch with other genres beyond rock. It covers Rock, Blues, Funk and Jazz, and for each of them the author includes grooves, fills and solos. Quarter notes, eights notes and sixteenth notes are used.The beats are useful and can be effectively used in every-day playing and the notation is big and easy to read, and a CD to hear all the exercises in the book is included too.Don't expect to learn to solo in odd times or in the style of Dave Weckl or Steve Smith; in fact, the solos presented are -little- variations of the grooves presented pages before but grouped together in 16 bars lenght, but they are a very good introduction and inspiration for total beginners."
4,helpful review,"I bought this book along with ""American History to 1877"" for the AP History exam. There is not enough information to learn all about the history, but these books are great for reviewing. They cover briefly most of the historical events and figures, and are organized so you can find the information quickly."
2,Only a little helpful,"The only way this book helped was that it made me familiar with major things that happened within the specified timeframe. Other than that, I was lost on the CLEP."
1,Very disappointed!,"I paid extra to get this ""BRAND NEW"" product in time for my daughter's birthday. Imagine how surprised I was that half of it was missing when I got it!! All four crossbars were missing from this ""BRAND NEW"" product. All I received was a useless metal X. I was so disappointed. And I had to pay a lot to ship it back because the box was really long. Over $25 for nothing!! I gave the seller more than one chance to correct the problem, but they took no action at all. This is my worst Amazon experience, period, and I buy pretty often."
5,Great Buy !!!!,Its a good product overall. Easy to assemble. comes with allen key.Looks good. Overall a good bet for the price.
2,Bad purchase,Maybe I didn't read the description well but this definitely does not serve the purpose for which it was purchased. My 7 year old has a keyboard that needed a stand. This stand it too tall for him but I cannot adjust it lower because it is then too wide for the keyboard and the keyboard falls off. So I am left with a stand that he needs a step stool to use.
2,Not too sturdy but does the job,"I got this in a bundle with the Yamaha YPT320. This stand doesn't fit too well with the Yamaha keyboard since the keyboard has 2 grooves underneath that can be screwed to the stand. It's also a bit wobbly when you're playing and the keyboard slide a little bit so you have to be careful when play. Maybe it will fit with other keyboards better but if you have the Yamaha YPT320, I woudln't get this one."
3,It works fine for my purposes,"First of all, I would NOT use this as a stand for my primary keyboard. For that I have a platform stand. This stand sits behind my 88 key workstation and it's higher to hold my 61 key arranger--and the reason I didn't just get a double stand is too convoluted to go into. I use the workstation to control the arranger so I don't actually play the keys on the arranger. If I did, I'd want something much sturdier.Remember that X-stands don't give you much room for your knees, or pedals, or what-have-you. This one is the bottom of the line I think and would be a little wobbly if I didn't have it crammed in between the wall and the platform stand. The arranger I own is quite light -- if it were any heavier I'd probably go up a step on the x-stand hierarchy."
2,smaller than original.,"I bought this as I dropped the original stylus in Lake, hoping Palm will have better quality.But it is smaller in length and Diameter, if I bend my phone it falls down.It works - just need to be careful."
1,Terrible Stylus,"Not only does it feel cheap, I could live with that, the stylus fits in the Treo 650 much too loosely. My previous stylus from Boxwave stayed in my Treo for over a year. When I lost it I wanted a quick replacement and these were the fastest I could get. I thought "" it's only a stylus"". I was wrong. They fit so loosely, I lost one on day 1. The next day I found the second one on the floor. I re-ordered from Boxwave and it fits great, like before. Stay far away from the Palmone 3181WW Stylus. It was a waste of money. Get new styluses ( or is it stylii) elsewhere."
1,NOT for Treo 750,"Though I ordered this product, I did not receive a ""Palm Standard Stylus 3-Pack Treo 750"" , but instead I got a Palm Standard Stylus 3-Pack Treo **650,700**. The styluses for the earlier Palms are shorter and the top is shaped differently so that if you try to store one in a 750 it tends to get stuck down the stylus slot. Not good. Don't know if it was a packing error or a listing error (my suspicion is the listing from the other reviews). Time to start scouring the local brick and mortar stores...sigh."
1,BaDdDdDdDdD,this is like the worst thing ever. it sucks. you cant even hear the other person talking. i was trying to find out the features of this phone and it broke in half.A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,pretty good shampoo,"While there are now more products on the market for helping to control natural wave or curl, many of them go out of production and leave me searching for a suitable replacement. Pantene is widely available, reasonably priced, and helps to achieve the style I want without weighing down my hair or making it look greasy. I've found that it works best when used together with the Smooth and Sleek conditioner."
5,Great Quality Dog Food,"My Boxer have tried various dog foods. He started with Nutro as a puppy but after a year, he started not liking his food so we switched to Science Diet. After much research, found that Science Diet did not use the quality products... so we switched to Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Adult Dog food. My dog loved the food but realized he had allergies to one of the ingredients. So we changed to Canidae and he loves this and has no allergies.When My husband and I researched good quality dog food, we found a lot of great quality dog food and most of them were pretty pricy but we found Canidae and Chicken Soup to be the best quality for a good price. I would recommend Canidae Lamb Meal and Brown Rice to any dog owners. My dog has been on it for about 6 months now and its been great!"
4,dog food,My female bulldog has skin allergies and this product really helps her condition. This is a good price for it with free shipping.
1,Dog developed GI problems,"Our 6-year old Vizsla has been eating Canidae for 3 years. A month ago we switched flavors from Bison to Sea Salmon. We gradually transitioned the change even though it was the same company. Within four weeks on the new flavor he developed a set of distressing systems including soft, mucus covered stools, horrible gas,low energy, staggering walk, excessive drooling, licking and constant neck extending (difficulty swallowing). A vet visit confirmed these as diet related. We put him on a chicken/rice diet and his symptoms stopped after just two days. Doing research to decide whether to switch back to bison or go with another company, I found a great deal of information about other pet owners having issues with all flavors of food from Canidae. Consumer Affairs reports a pending class action suit. We have decided to switch to another company."
1,Beware new formula!,"Canidae has changed the formula of their ALS recipes. Many, many dogs have become ill after eating the new formula. The web is full of complaints from dog owners whose dogs are experiencing the same awful symptoms (Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, hot spots and even seizures). Do your homework before buying this product. The company changed the formula without notifying the public. Would give zero stars if possible."
5,Canidae rocks,My Weimeraner loves Canidae dry food. It's healthy for her and leaves her always wanting more. Highly recommend it and it's worth the cost.
2,Look at the ingredients after chicken meal!,"I've heard this is a good food, but was shocked to see after chicken meal so many grains. I did not feed this to my dog. I'd rather pay more money for better quality food. All those fillers are unneeded. I expect such a highly regarded company to have better ingredients. I always look for by products but didn't think to even bother to check the next 4 ingredients. Highly disappointed."
1,"New formula (Aug, 2008) is no good","This has given my young dog persistent loose stools. My older dog also had problems with loose stools on the adult formula, which was immediately rectified by a change to Innova. See the large number of serious complaints on the web about the new formulation before buying."
1,My dog lost too much weight on this food.,"I have a two and a half year old female Boxer that has allergies to most commercial dog foods, so I keep her on a diet free of wheat, soy, and animal by-products. Canidae seemed to fit the criteria and was available at my local pet store (whereas, the brand I was feeding, Evo, had to be ordered), so I wanted to try it. I've been feeding my dog three and a half cups of Canidae dry dog food daily (divided between two feedings) for about five weeks, and she has lost a significant amount of weight on this diet. She is a very active dog that has always been lean, but she is now too skinny. I will be switching back to Evo and would not recommend Canidae."
1,Problem Dog Food,"I purchased Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula for my two Cocker Spaniels (Cavalier King Charles and American breed). After about two weeks, the problems began. Diarrhea, some vomiting and general malaise. Further feeding resulted in more problems. We had fed them Blue Buffalo and Eukanuba in the past but had never experienced these kind of problems. We returned to Eukahuba and both pets have returned to normal. I'm unsure what ingredients caused the problem but I will never use this product again and recommend caution before feeding your dog this food!Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 30-Pound Bag"
3,Switched Formula,Take care if choosing this food as they recently released a new formula that has more grains and has resulted in the superpoops for my dog that I have been feeding canidae for 2 years.
5,my son loves it,my son LOVE rodeos and bull ridding. he loved this DVD! he can watch it over and over. it came in on time and good conditions!
5,Great Book,"I found the book very interesting and fun to read. I have vision problems and so i can't read or look at anything for too long but i couldn't help myself when i got to this book. i couldnt put it down and i had to finish reading it to the end. I found it very enjoyable as i also ""fell"" for locke and xoayya."
1,New look,"I am not a very big fan of Michael Stackpole but I enjoyed this book very much. I have read many fantasy books and it is always refreshing to see a new idea. In a feild that is potentially unlimited most writers seem to stick with the tried and true ""Tolkien"" view of things which is not a bad thing but has been revisited too many times. Stackpole takes a new look at chaos and order and leaves magic in the backround. I am looking forward to reading the next book. When is it coming out???"
3,A Good Read,This book is very well written. The main character Locke is very appealing and I enjoyed seeing how he thought through problems and discovered who he was. The story is a little too typical and doesn't present anything that makes me want to know more about this world and its people. This book was good enough to be worth the time but not great enough to make me want more. M. Stackpole has another book Talion:Revenant which is an excellent book and very much worth reading.
2,a disappointing effort,"Being a fan of much of Stackpole's works, I looked forward to reading A Hero Born. Ultimately, I was disappointed. The book begins with lots of promise, but towards the end becomes a rather twisted mess of magic."
5,Quite simply the best book on the subject,"Scrupulously researched and elegantly argued with both clarity and impressive theoretical sophistication, this book may not make easy reading for the general public, but it is worth the effort. Bleys challenges many of the prevailing political, social, and academic commonplaces about male-to-male sexual behavior, and his evidence is for the most part irrefutable. The book calls for nothing less than a wholesale rethinking of notions such as ""sexual identity"" and the lays the groundwork for what would have to be a new politics of liberation."
3,Stereo System,"CD player not very efficient; cannot select, have to start with CD 1 and it will continue to 2 and 3."
4,John Scofield Rough House,"Actually I feel this is essential Scofield. It has a more straight ahead sound at a very high level of musicianship. Very few guitarists are able to negotiate soloing through Coltrane ""Giant Steps"" style chord changes evident in ""Aeleron"". Scofield does this with ease like bread and butter. Except for the light overdriven (juicy) sound of his Gibson 335 guitar, which I prefer over his current instrument, this is a no frills bebop CD laden with the classic Scofield signature. You know its him right away. There are a lot of notes being played, but they are quality notes. Hal Galper doesn't play around on this one either. Highly recommended listening for jazz guitar fans."
4,Early Scofield plays straight-ahead,"""Rough House"" features John Scofield playing straight-ahead jazz guitar with a rhythm section. The album has five Scofield originals and one song by pianist Hal Galper. Even though it was recorded in 1978, the sound is pretty good and doesn't have a 70's sound. Many of Scofield's recent discs have some sort of gimmick (or if it's a good disc, an enhancement) about them. This makes ""Rough House"" so refreshing. Scofield tears into the uptempo title track in the same spirit Wes Montgomery tears into ""Airegin"" on ""The Incredible Jazz Guitar"". This disc isn't as good as the Montgomery classic, but still worth the while of jazz guitar fans."
2,"Good reading, expired offer","Great gift for young readers but the complete-the-story contest offer, which would be fun experience, is expired."
2,Fair / Poor interpretations of classic marches,"I strongly suggest listening to the samples for this recording before purchasing this CD. If you are looking for a standard brass band performance of these works, this recording is *not* for you.It seemed as though the artists (whoever they are) were trying to be different or ""cute"". If you are looking for a ""cute"" interpretation of classics like Stars And Stripes Forever you may like this, but I found it to get irritating very quickly. A strongly suggest an alternative likeStars & Stripes Forever / Sousa Marchesif you want these songs done right."
3,Screw up,"I give this three stars because the original version - which you should not only own, but should put in your will - is one of the very funniest things that has ever been committed to paper. I, like another reviewer, had expected a hardcover edition to be definitive, but instead, we get an edited cover, glossy, one-dimensional paper, and an endless parade of poorly copied photos and advertisements. Whoever did this reprint was obviously just trying to do a quick and dirty job so that they could scrape a little more meat from the bleached bones of the America's Finest Humor Magazine.If this is the only copy you have access to (and have never seen the original), it is so funny that you may not see the problem. The jokes are still there, after all, and I can still laugh out loud while reading it.But....for $2.50 in 1974, we were given a diamond. This latest version feels like cubic zirconium."
5,Letting John Wayne Speak as Himself,"Westerns, of course, show John Wayne playing somebody else. In this documentary, we hear John Wayne speaking as himself, and commenting on many of the films that he has starred in as well as on westerns in general. His tone of conversation is a reflective one, and he doesn't come across nearly as blustery in everyday conversation as he does when on the screen.There are scenes from many old John Wayne westerns shown, and there are fine shots of the background scenery. Perhaps the most interesting part of this documentary, however, is its scenes of western clips in the process of being filmed. For instance, in one of them, John Wayne is filmed while sitting on the ground and throwing a rock while saying something in disgust. The director tells Wayne that he had not been expressive enough, and orders a retake of this scene."
1,Don't even consider watching this film!!!,"I cannot believe how bad this film was. Most of my time was spent hitting the fast forward button hoping there would be something, anything that made it all worth while. There wasn't. I generally love low budget horror flicks which is why I gave this one a try. There wasn't a single scary moment or even much blood? I even watched the making of the movie hoping there would be something that would give me a clue regarding a ""plot"" or what the movie was even about. We knew who the killer was immediately but never found out why? The making of the movie was actually more enjoyable to watch than the movie. I don't usually review films but if I could save just one person from seeing this, it's worth it. I actually purchased this movie based on a review that I had read. I've learned my lesson, always read all the reviews for a movie you've never heard of. Needless to say, my copy has been recycled."
2,People should decide what they're doing...,"Before making a movie, you should have some idea of what you're doing. Now,durign the opening scene, a killer jumps on a victim and shouts something like 'you think you're better than me, %^*%?!"" For no reason we ever learn about.The plot concerning people being killed off by things they fear most isn't used as much as you'd think and all of their 'fears' are either very generic fears or things that can fit into a very generic slasher. And halfway through the movie this plot is ditched so some crazy family plotline can be brought in that doesn't actually go anywhere."
1,Two thumbs down,"This is such a bad movie. And not bad in a funny or cheesy way. It's just bad. The acting and dialogue between characters was naseuating. I kept watching and waiting for something good to happen and nothing did. There is no action in this movie at all. They tried to make this movie a psychological thriller, but it fails miserably. Save your money and don't buy this movie unless you need something to bore you to sleep."
4,You better see this movie...,"American Nightmare is one of the best small budget movies I've ever seen. The look, and feel, of the movie is as good as any big budget film you're going to come across. The Director, Jon Keeyes, obviously takes a great deal of pride in his work, which comes shining through from beginning to end. And all of the cast do an equally fantastic job with their characters, and make you wish you could get to know them better before they are sent on their way by psycho nurse Jane Toppan. All the way around this is a movie that you need to check out. You'll be glad that you did."
3,Sufficiently Entertaining,"I enjoy this movie. Its low budget and generally lowish quality acting, but I still enjoyed it. It has an atmospheric feel that I enjoy, somewhat eerie, but playfully fun too. I found this movie from Hallow's End, another one I especially enjoy (in a guilty pleasure kind of way)."
3,was their when it happened,i havent watched the movie yet. but i am definatly going to buy it. i was actually their when they made it i got to help work the smoke machine. we live right down the road from where it was filmed. so im hoping it is as good as i have heard it is from my point of view back then all i got to see was what was happening on the outside and people being running around outside. lol. if it was scary for you guys think what it will be like for us since the building is right down the road. lol.
1,New formula nothing like old!,"I began feeding my dog Canidae after the tainted food scare. We loved everything about it and our dog had zero problems with it. Then they changed the formula. They made extreme changes and did not even slap a sticker on the bag to alert their consumers. After weeks of diarrhea and vomiting and hot spots and a large (unnecessary) vet bill, I finally discovered it was the food! We switched to a new brand and problems solved. Canidae has angered a lot of devoted customers. I would never buy their products again. Wish I could give them ZERO stars!"
3,Good CD,Not enough accompaniment to suit my liking. I'm not disappointed that I bought the album since I wanted to collect all of J.B. Hutto's available CDs.
5,Verbatim Ultra-life DVD's,"For those looking for a DVD that will last a long-long time these are for you. I had recorded all my family photos and videos, including old 8mm movie film and slides, on standard DVD's. Wanting to have a more permanent storge media I chose these disks, rated as Archival Grade. Now knowing that standard DVD's can last from 1 to ten years or less, depending on how they are stored, before they become unreadable, I didn't want that to happen to my unreplaceable family history. These are a bit more expensive, however, the peace of mind knowing they will not degrade in a few years is well worth the small increase in cost. I have used just about the entire 50 pack with no coasters."
2,Fail rate and scratch problem,"Was looking ot archive important photos so I shelled out for these since Verbatim have a good rep.I've tried 7 so far and 2 failed during the burn. Cheap manufacturing disappointed me.Also tested out the scratch guard on the failed ones (they are already failed so why not, right?) the scratch proof layer is almost non-existent. it feels a little tougher but my stapler scratches it easily. My fingernails wont scratch it though but my fingernails don't scratch regular CD's easily either. So I can tell there is an extra protective layer but a very thin one. Maybe I should have gotten some other brand."
5,Better than Delkin Archival Gold,Having used Delkin Archival Gold DVD's I find that Verbatum only had two bad discs out of 100 where Delkin ran closer to 20% bad. Much better price point with Verbatum.
1,Inconsistent Performance,"I used these for photography backup, and I was disappointed just a year or two later. Several discs will not read. Fortunately all the files are still on my hard drive, so I am glad I did not delete them there. Or I would be very angry. At $2 per disc I would have expected better performance. My plain jane Memorex DVD-R's still read just fine when they were copied at the same time. Therefore make sure you backup to the backup!! I will buy Delkin Archival Gold next time, and not use these again."
4,Good for Backup,"I do agree that there is a failure rate with these discs. Of the 35 I have used, so far 2 have been defective. While I back up all of my photos to 2 separate external hard drives (Lacies), I also do a 3rd back up on these and store these offsite. All in all a very good product. --Lara [...]."
2,Excessive failure rate,"I've experienced 4 failures to burn in 20 attempts with these archival DVDs. Also, even one of the 'successes' had a small surface defect. To me, this moots any archival advantages -- big disappointment!By comparison, the Archival Gold CD-R have given excellent service, with no burn failures in over 30 discs. The CD-Rs do not appear to have the anti-scratch coating, so perhaps this is part of the problem with the DVD-R version."
4,Seem to work fine,I converted some camcorder tapes to DVD format and then made copies onto these DVDs. No problems writing to any of these and reviewing them showed the copies were perfect. Unfortunately I will not know for ten or fifteen years if they are truly archival. but so far so good. I did make multiple copies to increase the odds of having readable media in he future.
2,Jewel cases arrived with broken spindles,"It wasn't until we opened four out of five of the packages that we discovered that the black plastic spindles in the jewel cases were all broken. Oh well, up against a deadline...."
5,Solid gold.,These discs are lovely and actually do appear to weigh more than other discs. The data transfers well and none of them have been defective so far (I've used about 15 out of 50.) This is a good price for a good product.
5,High Success Rate After 1 Year,"I bought this about a year ago. In the last 12 months, I probably experienced 1 to 2 failed disc out of 30 (Intel MAC failed to burn). I just started archiving a large batch of files, after 4 consecutive good burns, I suddenly come across 7 discs that won't burn. I try on two different computers with identical problem. The failure rate is just too high.NOTE: It turns out the problem was an OS issue. The disc now burns fine, so I changed my rating from 1 star back to 5."
1,"Awful, Awful Service","This service was absolutley horrible. I never received my order and sent several e-mails concerning the matter, and customer service was was horrible and unresponsive. I accidentally removed my feedback because I wanted to editeda misspelling, unfortunatelu I was unable to rerate this service because it was horrendous.I do not recommend this service to anybody!"
3,"Must have, but....","I have looked for this cd for years, and finally have it in my collection. All Your Love is one of my fav blues tunes. BUT... Otis does not have the most perfect timing.... Check out his turn arounds... The recording also has feedback on his guitar - not the good kind of feedback... Yes, I really like Otis and have many of his recordings. His studio recordings are more polished. This is one to have in your collection, but only if you are a true Otis fan. Pick up some of his studio recordings to get started before you get this one."
5,CD with a punch,"I have never heard of Winifred Horan. I took a chance and bought the CD after reviewing the songs. This was a winner of a buy. Horan gives the best blend of notes and passion that make this one of my favorite CD's. It's clear and crisp type of sound that few artist have been able to achieve. This is a sleeper CD that I think should sky rocket to the top of the charts. I had several friends over placed her CD in my out changer about mid way. After her album comes on and a couple of songs play, everyone is asking about the CD."
2,Not much to look at,"This isn't necessarily a bad DVD. Just not much going on. The action is rough- and I mean that in a bad way- these wrestlers need to continue their training and development (they are not up to Madusa status yet, by a long shot). But, it is inoffensive stuff- nothing to offend anyone, no foreign substances, etc. Who knows? There were some women who showed some promise, and we may see them in a big-time promotion someday. Overall, just OK. 2 stars"
1,Broken out of the box,They were well packed and the shipping box was undamaged. Installed the speakers and when I turned on the music there was terrible noise coming from one of them. Found that the tweeter stock had broken loose and was floating in the woofer. The assembly was only held in place by a dab of glue - not a good idea for a horizontally mounted piece in an assembly that will experience vertical shocks. Took the speaker apart to see if I could repair it and found horrible solder joints and bare wires that could short out to the speaker assembly. They whole thing looks like it was assembled by a child. I would stay far away from these speakers.
3,Screens Rusted out within 6 months,"I ordered the white speakers and the screens almost immediately started turning to rust. I have repainted them a couple of times and looking for replacement screens.Thanks,Brett"
3,wakeboard speakers,I received these during the winter when I opened them to install they were broken. the speaker mounting plastic where the screws conected them to the housing were all broke. I did not have time to return them so I fixed with longer screws and glue. very disapointed as this is my second set I added to my boat. The sound is very good
1,Supposedly 2005 was the last rating if you can believe this BS,25 people rated this cock and bull Writing your Screen Play review 5 Gold stars? What a crock! Nothing has sold since 2005? I call this a bit suspicious to say the least! These reviews are clearly FRAUDULENT! Please avoid anything to do with this author and use extreme prejudice. All of these reviews are fraudulent. Unless you are feeble minded dimwitted or mentally challenge avoid this product.
3,Its alright,The cd was alright. She is a [...] but I like her estilo and her lyrics...Big ups for Low Pro. I represent til I die
1,Terrible Cd,"I will tell you this cd is straight garbage. If your buying this cd to look at the girl then hell, its well worth your $15 if you think. Other then that this cd is not any good. The beats are ok, cause of course it the Low Pro beats, but Sancha gets annoying. I personally dont like girl rappers, cause they get annoying with thier whinning voice. The song with Sancho is, he rips it up tight, but the Sancha ruins the song. I have a few predictions why this album came out, listen to her, she and the Low Pro gang must be closer then it appears if you know what I mean. DONT BUY!!!"
3,same as cheaper hoses available,I have used this item a little and it works fine. I bought the Jet model and paid twice as much as the rest available thinking it woulld be of better quality. When it arrived I found it was the same hose I could have bought at any one of the cheap tool outlets for half the price.
2,suspicious dust,"These pads provide ample stopping power, however they are emitting a dust that has already pitted the chrome on my factory wheels.Previous pads never did this..."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This is a booklet with absolutely no useful recipes for today's cook or homemaker. If I ever offered any of these recipes at a party, my friends would probably never speak to me again. Like the title states, DO NOT waste your time or your money for this item."
1,blew out,"only lasted 5 work days the gasket blew out the seam, had a different brand swivel for four years on another gun with no problems. not impressed"
1,POS,"When I connected this air swivel to my air tool at work no air went through! I took apart the swivel to find out what was wrong and found that two holes that should have been drilled in the factory were missing. After I drilled the holes it worked. The other thing I noticed when I took it apart was there was metal flakes left inside the swivel, so if it had initially worked the metal flakes would have gotten into my air tool. Im only buying the good quality ones from the tool truck now. Im not going to risk breaking a expensive tool off a cheep air swivel I wanted to save a few bucks on."
2,amazon.com is the problem,"The article itself is somewhat informative, but can be found elsewhere via Google for free. amazon.com is the real problem not putting the article in my digital box for days despite multiple complaints and requests. There is no procedure for getting a refund even though amazon claims there is. Nor was a refund request via e-mail honored.As to the content of the article, both pro and con have legitimate statements to make, but let's face it, stents are putting surgeons out of business more and more."
1,handle bends too easly,when i try to cut my toenail it bends. the handle is too weak.i do have tough toenails.
3,It's Okay but...,"Due to a partial hip replacement surgery in Feb., 2010, my ability to bend is greatly compromised and the Long Reach Toenail Cutters are helpful, but I still have to really reach and bend my leg and torso. I would have been better off ordering one with a much longer handle. I have a 90 degree bending restriction for life."
2,Maybe for nose hair?,"These clippers seemed a great idea, but sadly don't work for heavy large toenails. The shafts are too insubstantial and bend so much the plastic handles touch, preventing the blades from cutting at all. Even if you distort them to allow the plastic handles to slide past each other, the shafts simply bend even further, leaving toenails laughing at you."
3,The Blood Bath,My try at using the Long Reach Toenail cutter resulted in a bad cut on my little toe which bled all over the place. I have since let the resident podiatrist at Willow Manor to work on my toes. The toenail cutter has since been put away in the kitchen drawer
1,Disappointing,"I recenty had hip replacement surgery and am unable to bend over very far or cross my leg to clip my toe nails. I did a search for ""long handeled toe nail clippers"" and this item came up. They are not really very long---and the blades are too wide to be of much use for toe nails. They also are not as sharp as regular nail clippers. So---I am glad they were not that expensive---because they are useless to me."
3,Fenugreek seeds,"Spicy World Methi Seeds (Fenugreek), 5-PoundGood spicy,good aroma and may good for health.I've been used daily in mixing with food."
2,great size but tape sticks a little to well,We just got back from a trip to disneyland and used these. They are a great size and definately made me more comfortable using public restrooms. The sticky tape stayed on the toilet seat. We also used these in the hotel room as she got used to using these while out. The tape stuck on the seat so bad my husband had to use quite a few differnt things we had with us to get it off. Sunscreen finally did the trick but what a hassle. Love the idea but be careful where you use them with the adhesive. Wish they used something semi sticky like post it notes have!
4,Public Potty protectors,"This was a great purchase. I recently went on a trip to Florida with my 4yr old. I used these when we were at the Disney parks and in the airport. The product has a plastic type backing that goes on the toilet seat and with the width hanging over the toilet seat it worked great. He never touched the seat. The one issue I had was that you had to watch that you didn't flush it, and with him jumping off the seat it fell in once or twice. The product comes with a sticky area, but found if I used it I couldn't get the sticky stuff off the toilet seat. Overall it is a great product for those little ones that need to hold on when going to the potty."
5,Art for toddlers!,"I love the fact that these books exist! My daughter is one and is mesmerized by these books. She sits down with them and just looks at them, intently. I love that I can share art with my toddler in a safe and fun way. Otherwise, I'd risk my expensive art books at her little hands. I highly recommend these books, even if you're not a big art fan. The colors alone are great for toddlers!!"
4,Very lovely,"Very nice pictures, with fairly decent accompanying text. I thought it included a good variety of Seurat's work as well, not just park pixillation paintings."
4,one of our bedtime favorites,"I enjoy reading this book to my daughter. She is 9 months old and she reaches for this book every night during our bedtime routine. I also bought the mini masters set which is a much better deal. This one is pricey just by itself. Also it is on the short side. It would be perfect if it had a few more pages. But no matter, we just end up reading it a few times since she likes it so much. Although my baby doesn't understand the rhymes, she enjoys listening to the flow, and staring at the pictures."
5,best collection ever,this album is a great great collection. i havent stopped listenin to it. awesome awesome awesome!!!!! had the honor of hearin a couple songs live in concert.
3,Missing bolts,"The delivery was OK but when I put the piece together it had 3 bolts missing, which made it impossible to assemble the last chair."
5,Amazing Book!,"This book is in my top five books of all time. Not only does it deal with causes of guilt but it explores practical ways of healing the guilt, forgiving one's self and others, and provides numerous exercises and meditations along with a large resource list to delve further into the subject. It incorporates the spiritual nature into the healing but does so in a way that it is not specific to any religion, or even to one with no religious tradition.From my experience Joan Borysenko may be the premier authority in integrating these subjects. She draws on experts from many fields along with her own experience and research and is able to present her conclusions and recommendations in an easy to understand format.I couldn't recommend this book more highly."
5,Metallic Underwear,These are kind of fun to wear. The manufacturer's size chart seems to be accurate.
4,Interesting account of survival among very brave and determined men.,"Great survival tale in the most extreme environmental conditions; easy reading that you won't want to put down. This book will confirm the fact that men of their time were of the ""greatest generation""."
3,Great story,"Wonderful story of a brave man and the people who helped him along the way. In my opinion the writing was not all that good and the editing was poor. If you overlook, the writing and editing, the book is a good read of a great adventure during WWII in Norway."
5,"unbelievable story, a little preachy at points","You have to give the book 5 stars simply for what Jan went through. It's little short of miraculous that he survived and went on to live a pretty normal life. There were a few points in the book where the author seemed to talk down to the reader, as if the book were intended for children, not adults. Don't let that put you off; if you're interested in WW II or just what a man can survive, read this book!"
3,Bit of a let down,"I'm mixed about this. On one hand there were three good matches-Cena & Edge, The Hardys, and the Six-man Tag.On the other, from a collector's view, it's barely any different from WrestleMania 25. There's not much you're going to miss if you don't have this one."
2,WWE running out of stars and ideas and stories,"the WWE , in my opinion, is getting tired.....the workers who supported the Rocks, and Austins are leading the way now and none of these guys is in the rarefied air of those legendary ""entertainers"" in my opinion...heck I miss Mick Foley who was a comic genius and crazy hard core nut! With the Randy Savage collection coming out it is a further reminder that between retirements, deaths and old age..the WWE is short of the colorful characters that propelled it to huge status in the 80's and 90's...and with The Undertaker heading out Kane fat and tired and Triple H a big nothing...This event just bored me. I like the Hardyz but even they are running out of ideas and the sibling rivalry thing is played."
2,"Terrible case, somewhat flimsy charger, ok headset","This package is ""get what you pay for"". It's inexpensive, but the included parts are not very well built. The headset stopped working after a few months, the charger doesn't stay in the cigarette adapter (I have not had this issue with the OEM charger) and the case is clunky."
3,"Works but, cut the plastic shield around the keyboard",The cover works well except that it's a little snug and I ended up cutting the plastic around the keyboard and buttons as it was harder to type with the plastic on. The car adapter works great and I haven't used the headset yet. I think that this is a great deal for the price.
2,Anxiety outweighed laughs for me,"Though I laughed a little through the book, all the anxiety of the characters gave me a little of my own. I didn't leave with the good feelings I expected from the reviews. Cute, but just OK."
2,This is a bathroom book.,"Make no mistake- the authors are not wrong. Each ""myth"" they cite, they are linguistically correct to eschew. But frankly, the book is dull. The sections are too short to do justice to the material, and only the barest surface explanations are skimmed. In some cases, one comes away with the idea that the author is right because he says he is right; you'll just have to take his word on it. Do yourself a favor and get Pinker or McWhorter or refer to the texts the segments in this book originate from. Never in my life has linguistics seemed quite so boring as this book makes it out to be."
4,highly recommended for everyone,"""Language myths"" is a book everyone should be required to read (or at least know the basic arguments of). The only complaint I have is that it would be nice to see (perhaps in the introduction) some discussion of why people hold onto these myths. It seems that many do so because it gives them a basis on which to categorize people socially, usually in such a way that they themselves end up at or near the top of their hierarchy. A more in-depth study of language myths in the USA is Rosina Lippi-Green's excellent book ""English with an accent: Language, ideology, and discrimination in the United States""."
3,Not much different from the pieces written by non-linguists,"The introduction states that this book is written by linguists as opposed to journalists, psychologists, or members of other fields. For that reason, I expected to somehow get more out of this book than I had out of The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker or any other book written by a non-linguist. I must say that I was disappointed. This book is an easily understood introduction to language, but to this layman, the information was no different than that provided by Pinker, etc.If you are looking for a thought provoking introduction to linguists, this is a very good book to read. On the otherhand, if you have read other books on the subject, it is not worthwhile to also read this one."
5,Interesting,"This is a collection of essays by today's leading linguists. Their mission is to debunk some of the most popular myths about languages. For example, some of the topics coverd are ""Double Negatives Are Illogical,"" ""TV Makes People Sound the Same,"" and ""Some Languages Are Harder Than Others."" My favorite essay had to do with the topic of the perception of American dialects.I think this book is very easy to read and it's not necessary to have a background in linguistics to enjoy it. Also, some of the things you learn by reading this book will give you a chance to get revenge on your high school English teacher. Check it out."
3,"comfortable nursing bra but not a lot of support, terrible straps","I like how comfortable this bra is and how easy it is to undo the latch with one hand but the support is not very good if you are large chested. Also, the clear straps are terrible. They stick to your skin, makes you sweat, and they won't stay adjusted. Each time before I put this bra on I adjust the straps but since they are clear plastic they invariable slip back down and make the support worse. It's an okay bra but not good if you need a lot of support."
2,A Travel Novella,This short Novella is essentially a travel essay. I found it to be interesting and perhaps a bit indulgent. Overall a good quick read.
4,"Nice, Quick Read","A little pricey for a story the size of a magazine article. The book is tiny - the size of a children's novelty book. The content is excellent and rich with descriptions and history. The story is fascinating but a tad disappointing in that although he is able to smoke real opium I don't think he can claim to have visited a real opium ""den."" Good read for the dope fiend in your life."
4,Great B.S.From a Master B.S.er,"Nick Tosches's barroom-holding-forth manner of supporting sweeping generalizations and grand statements with anecdotes and suppositions that are so interesting that you swallow the whole package is stylistically admirable, at least when there's some solid research as a foundation. There's a certain amount of B.S. evident in even his best books, such as Hellfire, but it's good B.S. that the reader will likely want to believe and (most importantly) is used sparingly.When that foundation is lacking (as in King of the Jews), the results are disastrous.The Last Opium Den has a good deal of research, but plenty of suppositions and suspect anecdotes that the reader is likely to accept at face value unless a little thought is given to them, much like the statements of a great barroom storyteller. Thoroughly entertaining, but difficult to say where the truth ends and the B.S. begins."
1,Charger doesn't work,"I purchased this two weeks ago. The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off. I checked the tracking info a couple of days after the order and saw that the company said my product had been delivered last month. The company assured me that the product was on its way and indeed, it did get to me. However, when I tried using it, the connector on the wall plug did NOT fit my Sansa. The car charger does so I guess it's not a total loss. Can't figure out why the car charger would fit my Sansa and not the wall plug. Eyeballing them, they look just like each other. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Didn't work for me,"There were a lot of positive reviews so I was hopeful. The car charger fit but the wall charger didn't. I looks like it should fit but could not get it into the slot. For the price it was worth a shot and at least I got the car charger to fit. I don't use it much though, I really wanted the wall charger more."
4,Good Customer Service,"Okay, they made a mistake. I was send 2 car adaptors instead of a car adaptor and AC adaptor. One Email to their customer service and with no hassle an AC adaptor was sent to me at no charge. It was a good deal."
1,Junk,"In short, don't bother with this charger!You get what you pay for with this item. The charge from the wall charger only lasts a couple of hours. The LED indicator is a joke (it stays on and green for however long you leave it plugged in). If you want to save yourself time and money, I recommend you invest in a quality charger and NOT a generic."
2,cheap connectors,"The product is inexpensive...that's nice, but it's difficult to put the connector in and out of the player to the point that it felt it might become damaged. I'll trash these and find something of higher quality."
1,AC CHARGER DID NOT HAVE CORRECT CONNECTOR,AC WALL CHARGER DID NOT HAVE CORRECT CONNECTOR FOR E200 SERIES. THE CIG. LIGHTER HAD THE CORRECT CONNECTOR. HAD TO RETURN IT.
4,Sandisk Charger,"As of yet, I have only used the wall charger but both items were very inexpensive and the wall charger works great."
4,2-Piece Value Combo Pack Of Brand New Home Wall Travel Plug in Ac Charger + Vehicle Cigarette Lighter,"Decent product, vehicle cigarette lighter charger is a bit flimsy. Product arrived ahead of schedule, and in new condition as advertised by seller but packaging could be better."
1,kw-tx,The plug in charger worked great - the first time I used it but no longer works. The light to the charger stays lit even when unplugged but will not charge. The car charger still works....for now. I would go with a name brand product and pay more for better quality.
1,Blew a fuse,"The car charger blew a fuse in my car after just a few weeks of use. I haven't tried using either charger since then, fearing what they might do to my house or my Sansa."
1,bargaincell sucks,"order from another vendor. aside from inferior products, bargaincell took almost a full week to merely put my order in the mail."
2,"Worked great, until it burned out the charging circuit in the Sansa...","Player has been working well for a while now but I was tired of charging it via the PC. I plugged in the Sansa to the new wall charger and after a few minutes of the ""charging"" animation, the battery icon turned grey and that was all she wrote. Sansa still works but the battery cannot be charged. I can still run it off the old USB cable but it does not charge the battery.Oddly enough, the battery isn't ""dead"". If I let the player power on after plugging it in and then unplugging it, the battery status just shows an empty grey battery but it has been playing music for over 30 mins now. This charger did something to the Sansa and it wasn't ""charge the battery""."
5,Calvin,"For the price it can't be beat!!!!! Both items worked perfectly and the quality seems excellent. How can I say anything bad when the cost was only $6.00. INCLUDING SHIPPING!!!! I'm thinking of buying a few more just to keep them handy at work, in the car, on the boat, etc. A definate buy!"
3,Gizgalaxy made good on super slow delivery problem,"The small item ordered was supposed to arrive on or about September 1, 2010. After various email communication with company as to whereabouts of the product which was needed for a planned trip company processed refund since item still had not arrived as of September 18th. Left on trip Sept 19th returned Sept.29th and apparently item was delivered on September 23rd. Company handled problem professionally but am still a bit disappointed that I did not have the use of it during our trip."
1,B.S.,"This product was billed as being copatable with my sansa 250,however it ""DOES NOT FIT THIS PRODUCT"" I would have returned it but it was too cheap to bother with."
5,2 piece combo pack,This pack arrive within days of order. It was in excellent shape. Every thing in working order. Thank you.
3,"Nice scrubber, not long enough for a thermos","This washer is OK for baby bottles and jars, but it's not good enoughfor the task I bought it for --- cleaning my thermos. The handle's notlong enough for that; and if you do try to wash a thermos, the fat endwill get stuck in the bottle-neck. I haven't figured out yet what willwork better, but this isn't the ticket. I'll have to invent my ownthermos scrubber."
3,Not all plastic,I've been looking all over for all plastic sponge dish mops. I like to toss them in the microwave wet for a few seconds to keep them disinfected and smelling okay. Unfortunately this version has a metal part that holds the sponge head.Otherwise this is product is acceptable. The handle is nine inches long. Any longer and it would be unwieldy.
4,Nice Balls,I hit these just as far into the woods as any other ball and for a lot less cost! Honestly i can't tell the difference between these balls and the more expensive ones. They seem to go just as far on average and i dont play any better or worse with them. The bonus of the golf digest tee time membership is a big plus. Find one discount round in your area and it pays for the box of balls.
5,Great Golf Balls,A friend of mine found a Fuzz golf ball and played the best round of his life with it. He was afraid to use it again because he might lose it. I found Fuzz golf balls on Amazon and decided to buy some for him. He loves them and has been playing the best golf of the summer and fall. He is hitting the ball further and straighter than he ever has.
4,"Good Golf Ball, LOUSY price.","These are great golf balls. I was able to hit them farther and longer than most golf balls out there.HOWEVER.....$17.00 is VERY high for these balls. I've see them at other stores for $8.99 to $11.99.Soooooo, don't buy them here! Even K-Mart has them $9.99"
5,Great for older golfers,My husband has enjoyed using this product. Shared with other golfers and they are amazed at the distance you can achieve. This is especially good for older men and perhaps women who play golf. He will purchase these again
5,1st Ball I didn't loose!,"I absolutely love FUZZ BALLz! I recently bought some and they are great! Love the packaging and wicked long, wicked soft insignia...I played the first full 18 holes and didn't loose my ball with one of these dudes! That is incredible since i am a bogey golfer with a 16 handicap!They drive long and straight and maintain a consistent, continuenty feel regardless of the shot, driver or iron!The putting has a soft feel as well - i do not note anything different from other balls on the green. :)And the best part is, they are a cult secret, no one knows much about them! Shhhhhhh!"
4,All golf balls don't look alike,My husband shoots in the high 70's. he likes these balls but says they didn't make his game any better or worse
3,"In the Beginning, Hope and Michael..","I remember watching the original pilot in 1987 and thinking it was wonderful. Twenty-two years later, I actually found it slow-moving and the main characters, Hope and Michael, without any real depth. I did enjoy the characters Melissa, Michael's awkward and lovable cousin, the photographer and Gary, Michael's best friend, a college professor, a bit of a playboy and Melissa's ex-boyfriend. One notable seen in the pilot is one that most new parents trying to spend time with their childless and career-oriented friends can relate to; Hope and her best friend Ellen attempting to have lunch with a crying baby Janey making it impossible! The competition, the underlying jealousies that Hope and Ellen feel is just under the surface.I recommend the Pilot Episode of Thirtysomething to all the super-fans of the show!"
3,My rating is for the pilot epiosode only.,"As a pilot, I'd give the episode a C. However, the series itself is pretty amazing. What's interesting about this series is that some episodes are so dull that they're practically unwatchable, then there are other episodes that are so amazing that you remember the dialogue 20 years later! This series won 13 Emmys in 4 short years, including Best Drama. All the cast shines, but Patrica Wettig as Nancy, Timothy Busfield as Elliot and Polly Draper as Ellen really deliver some powerhouse acting throughout the series."
4,"When buying this book, verify that it is right for your class.",The quality of the used book was great. The only problem I had with it was that it was not my professor's personal selections of articles. So now I have a book that I cannot even use; I had to go to my bookstore and purchase the right one.
5,This is the most useful Russian reference book I have seen.,"This reference book is a have-to for students of Russian. It goes beyond the other verb conjugtion manuals by giving specific times when the verb (and its forms) would be used, the cases used in each example, and sample items. You need this one to master Russian verbs!"
5,Truly indespensable,"I've been using this book for 1 1/2 years now and its dog-eared quality is second only to that of my main textbook. Its sample sentences are what bring new verbs alive to me. I've had Russian friends tape record these sentences as I've encountered new verbs, so I've gotten the benefit from both print and aural presentations of the book's contents. If I hadn't bought this book I would have had to invent it myself. It, together with 501 Verbs: Fully Conjugated and the Russian/Eng dictionary are my triumvirate. There is zero chance you'll regret this purchase."
4,750 russian verbs and their uses,"This is an excellent supplement to the Big Silver Book of 555 Russian Verbs fully conjugated by Jack Franke or the Big Silver Book of 555 Russian verbs is an excellent supplement to the present book by Issa Zauber. Sven Aschberg, chronic student of russian language"
5,Countertenors: They're not just for Baroque Anymore!,"OK, so it's a bad pun. Shoot me.But get this wonderful disc! Daniels talent is well-served by this varied program.. he goes beyond Handel to sing Beethoven, Gounoud, Vaughan-Williams.Don't just buy this for the novelty of countertenor singing: the singing would be 5 star had any mezzo (Bartoli, van Otter) sung with this sensitivity. It's superb in every regard."
3,Return of the Frustration But Fun,Cool light saber action and this time you can throw it. Nice!!! Same game play as other two but this time its a bit more challenging. Seems like anyway. Go see the game play video and samples of each level on Youtube at JBugGamer channel.
4,An Enlightening and Quick Read,"""Advent Of The Savior"" is a short introduction to the Infancy Narratives of Sts. Matthew and Luke. It is divided into separate sections for each Evangelist. After the introductions, each division begins with a selection from the Gospel followed by commentary. The organization is to go through the narratives of Matthew in sequence, followed by the narratives of Luke. The commentaries provide interesting background material and citations to related Old and New Testament texts.The excellent job that Author Stephen J. Binz does in drawing parallels to other parts of the Bible is enlightening. One example is the comparison of the three days during which Jesus was lost with the three days that he spent in the tomb.With only sixty-four pages, this is not a thorough study. It serves well as a guide for a short study of the Infancy Narratives. It is an enlightening and quick read."
4,Short but good,"This was a much better book than I originally expected it to be. The author, a Roman Catholic priest, introduces and explains the infancy narratives contained in the gospels of Matthew and Luke, observing especially the foreshadowing of these events in the Old Testament and the foreshadowing within the infancy narratives themselves of the coming death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. There are some very insightful comments on all of these passages to be found in this book. It's a very short read; it took me only two sessions of reading to finish completely. It's definitely worth checking out to get your mind and heart oriented toward the coming of Christ during the Nativity fast."
2,Perma brew,Very weak device. I like my coffee strong and the perma brew produces a weak flavorless cup of coffee. For those who don't mind drinking a weak cup of coffee this is a product they may find useful. The price is not bad and the device is easy to use.
5,REALLY HANDY,I love this little coffee spoon as I call it. I have given them to other members of my family and we all enjoy them. It is so handy when you only want one cup of coffee and it really works well and makes a great cup of coffee. I haven't tried it with loose tea but I think it would work well. Great little gift for the person who has everything!!
2,this thing is a joke!,"hard to use and get a decent cup of coffee, messy to fill, just an overall waste of money. sent it to the Goodwill!"
4,"""Micro Bust"" but freakin sweet","Let me start off and say, these bust are limited edition ! only 2500 in the world. Individually hand numbered on the bottom The only real complaint is the size, the statue is only 6/7 inches tall. However it really looks amazing with the inserted knife & lighted up. Yes, it is overpriced. But being limited edition and looking amazing, It's completely worth it."
2,too small,"i bought this for my husband. he has a slight obsession with michael myers and the halloween movies. he was dissapointed in this figure, it is very small-especially for the price. if you're looking for a cool michael myers figure don't buy this, buy the motion activated action figure."
1,Movie Mars is a Ripoff Company,"In this version, Exodus had only one scene. It was a blue screen with the words ""Region Code"" written in the upper left corner. Movie Mars was the company that sold me the DVD. They are located in North Carolina and so am I. I wondered why they sent me a DVD that only plays on equipment in the Far East. They did let me return the DVD and they did refund the price of the DVD, but didn't offer the option of replacing it with a working version. I got to pay for shipping and handling BOTH WAYS, and they ignored my request for a refund on that. So for six bucks, I got exactly nothing except aggravation. I looked up Movie Mars and sure enough, they get tons of complaints about selling pirated DVDs (I'm not claiming that, but others do, and why would they be selling non-American coded DVDs otherwise?) lousy customer service, overly cheap mailers, etc. Movie Mars is a shady operation and I sure won't be buying from them again."
1,Wrong DVD format PAL sent,Received wrong DVD format for Region 2 PAL. Will not play back on Region 1 NTSC coding for US equipment. Returned item.
1,anamorphic DVD or BluRay please!!!!,"I agree with the posting that states: ""Love the movie, hate the DVD."" The currently available DVD transfer is horrible, shameful. A movie as good as this should at least be available on anamorphic DVD or better yet, BluRay. Because the current DVD is not anamorphic, it does not play properly on today's widescreen, HDTV's. The film does not properly fit today's HDTV widescreen and the picture quality is no better than a VHS tape, in fact, it's worse than VHS tape."
2,"paul Newman looks damn fine, but It was wiggity wack!!!!",This was a bad representation of what went on during the partition of palestine. Paul newman looks pretty good so it made up for the rest of the nonesence.
3,exodus was a gift purchase,"you send me a email wanting to review this movie, didn't watch it, got it for a gift. sorry"
3,plodding but most interesting mention of the systematic rape by Nazis,"I'm appalled by the German military participants in military history documentaries who disclaim any responsibility in harming the Jews to death because they were soldiers as in warriors as in honorable military tradition but they sent young Jewish boys and girls to be raped to death by German soldiers and it's mentioned in this movie. We never draw the parallels between the actions of the two true Axis allies. I wasn't thrilled by the cast and the cinematography, basically I found this movie to be boring. I much preferred a news clip about a survivor of Nazi'ed Europe who participated in secretly making weapons under the British noses to recover Israel for the Jews. His team used sun lamps to give themselves sun damaged faces so the British wouldn't know they were making ammo underground. His name was Schlomo! After all the bogusness, the Jews just wanted to be home and alone with their own people."
3,"interesting, and page turning","I have not yet seen the movie, but hope to soon. I read the book it was great."
1,Dreadful DVD Transfer Of A Major Film,The One Star is not for the film but for MGM Home Video's abominable DVD transfer. What a disgrace! How MGM could release this epic film in such a fashion is beyond belief. The image is virtually unwatchable. I'm surprised more readers on this site haven't complained about how this famous movie has been treated by MGM Video. This DVD edition does not represent the movie whatsoever. Hopefully a remastered DVD edition will come out in the not too distant future to rectify the problem.
4,Couldn't watch,"I'm glad you asked. I was sent a copy which wouldn't play on my two DVD's. When I enquired why, I was told the copy was for the Middle East. I asked since when was Manchester, NJ (my hometown) in the Middle East. They did send my an addressed and paid for mail to send back to them which I haven't done as yet, but what I really want is one for the USA whcih I can play.To send it back is an effort (especially this time of year) and I cannot stand on long lines. If you could help, I'd appreciate it."
5,closer to the original 70mm theatrical release,"one of the first 70mm films i saw back in 1962 was ""Exodus"" and viewing this video is more o less very close to the memory i had of the film if is not possible to see the film in a theatre and less in a big 70mm house. so the best you can do is to buy this video an enjoy it. miguel carrara"
2,slow,"This is one of those movies , it takes awhile to get into...Maybe if i just have a day when it is just me and then i will let you know"
1,Was disappointed,I saw this movie in the 60's and wanted to see it again. I was so disappointed seeing it after reading the book. But Paul Newman is so easy on the eyes.
4,Exodus,"Exodus is a very historically accurate movie about the famous boat ""Exodus"" that illegally got countless Holocaust survivors to Israel, then Palestine, and, ultimately, it is also about the creation of the State of Israel.I believe the movie is pretty good and well thought out; all the characters are completely believable (Paul Newman was great as the main character!), and the story line and plot are great. Some scenes were very impressive, realistic, and even a bit disturbing. However, the movie is exceptionally long, and that makes the viewers lose interest on it after a while and ""miss"" a lot of good parts.Still, it's a good film and definitely worth your time - if you have it! I suggest not watching the whole movie at once, but rather taking a few breaks in between, because, quite frankly, otherwise, the magic of the whole movie is lost."
2,Opportunity Wasted,"The film is excellent. However, MGM failed to give it a transfer worthy of the product. Technically, the film appears washed out with poor color. The sound is inferior. They used Dolby Surround when it should have 5.1 Dolby Digital. The intermission was cut out. There are no chapter lists or an insert. Kind of like a Goodtimes DVD.If you want to see a fairly good rendition of this film, check out the laserdisc. It is complete with intermission. It was manufactured prior to DD 5.1.Hopefully, it will be reissued in a better edition."
2,Awful by today's standards,"I just watched this film tonight on TCM. It is terrible. Cinematography mediocre, even Paul Newman's acting is as bad as I've ever seen, and Trumbo's script and dialogue may be worse (if possible) than Spartacus.Now I now why the ""new Hollywood"" rennaisance took place. After watching this turkey, Hal Ashby, Bonnie & Clyde, and Chinatown look like works of genius.Oh boy, time can be brutal, and in the case of ""Exodus"" - we may have to come up with a new word.Totally over-rated - if you value your time (life is short)- go elsewhere."
2,Awful and a total waste of time,"I saw this movie and I hated it. It was extremely commercial and it did not focus on the historical events that are the most important parts of the story. It was tremendously bias and way to sappy, I would not recommend it."
5,Preminger's Definitive EPIC,"Preminger was always fearless, a gutsy bravado in the face of cowardice, and he shines through his films like a beacon of cinematic paradise. His works are always uncomromising, presenting tense situations, uncomfortable issues and ultimately human characters. His parable of man against man is revelatory of his views on his medium and life in general, man made conditions political and environmental propelling us against one another. EXODUS is another of his fascinating creations, arguably his greatest epic(see THE CARDINAL,IN HARM'S WAY,HURRY SUNDOWN), a dreamy ,haunting and ultimately shattering take on the unending struggle between the Jews and the Palestines. He never fails to wrap us in his world and refuse to let go."
3,"To quote Halliwell, ""a good solid plod"".","Released in 1960 and running 3 hours and 27 minutes, EXODUS is not exactly a film you watch casually. You make a commitment, and if you are bent enough on seeing it, you might be rewarded. The performances are generally adequate, with the exception of Lee J. Cobb's excellent Barak Ben Canaan and Hugh Griffith's memorable ship buyer. Despite all the plaudits he recieved, Sal Mineo really seems a bit on the hammy side. Otto Preminger's direction manages to keep the film from becoming intolerable, and he must be commended for attempting an epic about people, not just things, but EXODUS is somewhat underwhelming. Ernest Gold's memorable theme won an Oscar. Some sources list running times of 212 and 220 minutes, and these may include Overture, Intermission, and Exit Music, none of which are on MGM's budget release.Recommended for renting more than buying.Jamie Teller"
1,Poor quality video transfer,"I was disappointed with the quality of the video transfer. I'm not sure if the images started to get better half-way into the film, or my eyes just adjusted to the pixel problems. My son watched the first 15 minutes then he couldn't take the poor quality of the video and he gave up."
2,great topic but superficial like telenovella. lack depth,"i wished i like this movie more.i expected to see a grand epic like Lawrence Of Arabia, The Last Emperorturned out it is a small movie, like today's made for TV movie.the creation of the Israel nation is an epic historical story, one can tell from many angles, perspectives and political sentimentsyet this movie was made like a mini novella for our day time soap.disappointing. hope today's new movie makers have the courage to make something better,perhaps not with Leon Uris' novel but on O Jerusalem from Dominque & Lapierre"
1,DVD of EXODUS A DISAPPOINMENT,I saw this movie when it was released years ago. I was impressedby it so I even read the book and it also fueled my interest onthe Jewish people.I am disappointed at the quality of the DVD of the same movie.I may have been too young when I first saw it and may justhave neen impressed by Paul Newman's good looks.
3,Birth of a Nation,"This film is based on an outstanding novel by Leon Uris in which Paul Newman frees, tranports, and meets all challanges to establish a new State. It is nearly impossible to view this film and not be moved by the trials and tribulations of the Jewish race to have a country of thier own notwithstanding the negative attitude of the rest of the world that such a state is impossible. Keep your chin up and cheer on the underdog ! You'll be mighty glad in the end."
4,Good on Technique,"This is a good source of endurance info. It has good information of skill and technique development. Marc Evans takes more of a 'whole athlete' view than some other endurance writers. There are better books on triathlon training, but this is a well balanced text on endurance."
3,"I would not call this the ""best"" of Sanchez",Sanchez is no doubt a great talent but this is not the best!! One in a Million is a much better CD than this check that out first if you want a good Sanchez hits CD.
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"I bought this slicer, to cut my German bread, that I bake myself. The slicer worked good at first and I was pleased, but after 5 1/2 months, I started to have problems with it. The machine started to make noises and the blade would stop spinning. Come to find out, that the gears ( located underneath the blade ) are made out of plastic and the wore out. So if you need this slicer for cutting bread like I do, it's no good.Now I'm on the search for a slicer that has gears out of metal, but it seems like there is none. I've contacted Deni and Waring and their gears are made out of plastic as well. So if anyone out there has a slicer that has metal gears or has a slicer that has lasted more than 1 year in constant use, please let me know. I need a good one for a decent price."
3,Rival Food Slicer,Found the safety button a bit hard to hold while slicing meat. Other than that the slicer worked well.
2,Just Ok,"If you, are a computer programmer and, like to go deep into the meta code then this is for you. I need things to be simple and quick! - Stephen Woessner has a great dvd set on seo. simple and to the point, for an everyday person. I though this dvd might add something to Woessner's dvds, it does not!"
4,have had them for years,"I purchased these for my husband, when I couldn't find any slippers that fit him. They fit, they are adjustable, they wash beautifully. They look as good today as the day I bought them. He finds them very comfortable. He isn't ambulatory, so the slick soles don't matter. I don't know how safe they would be to walk in."
3,edema slippers,"I think the product would have been ok if I had realized how big they were. I will have eto return them, but the problem is with the swollen feet, not the product. I should have looked for measurements."
2,Historically interesting maybe???,"Edith is just your average background blues singer, like a zillion others, who happened to be hanging around the right guys at the right time and got a shot at solo recording. She had neither the repertoire or the vocal chops to ever be considered a true heavy.. and is, in fact, not considered so most critics. In short, I felt taken by getting this CD - sloppy charts poorly recorded by guys well past their prime and who barely had real credentials. They do have cool names - like ""Little Brother Montgomery..."" and when you read up the players in the sleeve it says stuff like they sometimes ""sat in"" with King Oliver! - come on...that's nothing like being a regular with King Oliver. But, on the plus side, I was VERY grateful to have bought Clara Smith at the same time - who IS the real deal. She's amazingly great, and worth twice what you'd pay here to have in your collection."
4,Simply Wonderful Movie,I sat and looked at this movie and I really enjoyed it. This movie was too big to be a stage play and it's better in movie form.
3,musnt accept everything in it as exact,this book gives a good bit of detail surrounding the irish(catholic) involvement and dispels the myth that there no catholic irish involvement in the american revolution.but the author is weak in contextualising the evidence.he suggests that the majority of irish participation in the revolution was catholic which simply isnt true and makes wild assumptions on little evidence. still an important contribution to irish history but wished he had been more rigorous with his analysis.
1,Chemical smell makes me sick,the ball had a chemical smell so strong that it made me sick. i thought the smell would go away but after more than two months the smell is still strong enough to make me nauseous. i can't us it.
4,Good quality,"The ball is of good quality, it holds air well. The only negative is that after more than one month, it still emits a sweet smelling odor. I read many reviews to pick the best one since I did not want to waste money on an inferior product that would not last. Seems like there is no perfect product."
5,Comfortable for sitting,"I use the FitBall instead of a chair, for better posture and to eliminate lower back pain. I like the pearly white color."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I ordered the 55cm fitball from HPMS for a person 5'-2"" and it is way way way too small. I wanted to use it at my desk, but I can't even reach the desktop! I'm practically sitting on the floor! I called customer service and they will not exchange it at all because I opened the pump. Consumer beware. Don't open a single item they send you until you are sure it will fit you (somehow...I suppose you'll just have to guess by looking at the outside of the box). If you do choose to buy from this vendor (I strongly discourage it), make sure you buy a ball AT LEAST a size or two bigger! Extremely disappointed and very angry."
3,"Too spongy, not the best for the money","I'm 6', 185 lbs and ordered the 65cm FitBALL to replace a popped Theraband ball (kids+nail = popped+time outs) and am directing this review to people who are heavier and like a stiff ball for core workouts. This isn't it. At full inflation (measured at 65 cm) the ball sinks nearly 7 inches when I sit on it and loses its round for a while afterwords. In contrast, the Theraband ball of old would deflect maybe 2-3 inches and I had no trouble with it losing its round. The 65 cm Theraband may be an ugly green color, but it is a much better exercise ball so back I go..."
3,Basic Primer,"Quick and simple overview of the rifle, focusing on history and variations. Not nearly as in-depth as I would have liked. Guess I need to shell out the big bucks and get Blake Stevens' ""The Fal Rifle."""
2,"Nope, sorry.","I saw these guys on Ripley's and they seemed pretty cool so I ordered the DVD, and it wasn't what I expected at all. It has very few shots of them doing their stunts. The plot was borning, and it was overall very poor acting. Don't waste your money on this."
5,Required reading for every American.,"Hightower has an astute ability to bring forth the serious issues whilst remaining unpretentious. He conveys his thoughts without being indentured to partisanship. I bought 2 extra copies and left them at different laundromats. This book needs to be read by as many ordinary Americans as possible. It's time to end the juggernaut of corporatized government. If we ignore the machinations of the elite, the rest of us will be left only to be employed by delivering pizza's to one another. Unable to purchase anything but products made by slaves in 3rd world countries. While they enjoy the dividends, and party it up! Again,at our expense."
3,A Good Job Showing How Corrupt the U.S. Government Is,"Tho the book does a good job showing how bad the U.S. Government is, but it also advocated overthrowing it in clever ways, like by referring to the Revolutionary War. Iit falls short in that it gives no solution as to how to make the government better in the long run, but rather how to make short term changes and is vague about how to do that as well. The main problem is that the author seems to leave out God as the best solution."
5,Insightful and relevant,"Here is a political, social commentary that is relevant and well-prepared, delivered with a voice of authority and substantial candor and wit. I enjoyed it and - even when I disagreed - I was delighted with the author's insight."
5,Telling it Like It Is.,"This is an excellent book although the WalMart chapter made my so annoyed that now I won't shop at any WalMart. Can anyone believe that a company would take out ""stealth"" life insurance policies on unwitting employees just to make more money? Aren't the billions they're already making enough? This is sleazy, disgusting and it's WalMart to the core! Anyway, the rest of the book is good too. It's an eye opener."
5,Focuses the Light of Reform on the Source of the Problem,"Hightower (like fellow writer Michael Moore) has the guts to tell the truth. The real terrorists are occupying the White House, Capitol Hill, and the rest of the high places of government. People around the world don't hate our freedoms or average everyday Americans. Instead they hate the greedy face of corporate America that supports torurous regimes that destroy their livelihoods and cultures. If you want to fight terrorism, read this book, and vote BushCo out of office in November. Otherwise the next constitutional amendment there creeps go for will be aimed right at you. If you are afraid of the truth, and wish to live in fear as BushCo wants you to, roll over and play dead. Otherwise, get this today, and get to work."
3,Good but has some flaws,"Overall I would say this book is worth reading. I thought the chapters concerning Wal-Mart, sweat shops, and the food supply were particularly compelling. At times the ""down home"" style of the book was funny, but other times it was tedious (i.e., I just wanted to get to the facts). I think some of the information contained in the earlier chapters about Bush is better covered by Molly Ivins' ""Bushwhacked."" The biggest flaw of the book is the documentation. There is an enormous amount of data and statistics, but usually there is no footnote or endnote (some of the tables do have references) - there is merely a list at the back of the book of organizations, so it is nearly impossible to do some fact checking if desired."
2,"Quirky and interesting ideas, but no bibliography!!!!","GRRRRR! I hate when these political ""experts"" write an entire book without sources. Basically this is one big liberal rant...come one no matter right or left...SOURCES are a must!"
1,A Disappointment,"Jim is a great spokesperson for the left, but the ideas expressed in this tome have no balance and therefore are not very credible. For example, Jim talks bad about corporate America, corporate profits, corporations giving to politicians and yet his own book is published by a multi-national corporation. Like most authors, I am sure Jim got an advance on his book's sales and by doing so he took money from a large corporation to get his message out about how bad big busines really is. Hahahahah The whole thing is laughable and there is indeed a sucker born every minute and I am sorry to say it will be the reader of this book once purchased."
1,Save Your Money...,"This book says nothing new, the same ole stale liberal rhetoric based on emotion rather than fact. No one has stolen the country, Liberal policies don't work and are being rejected all over the country. I like the Liberal look at the title, they've stolen our country... they, as in Republicans, who have no place in ""our Liberal"" society....oh the times are a changin!Socialism is on the way out,...thankfully!"
1,LockStep with eyes clinched tightly closed,"If you march LockStep to the shrieks and lies of the ultra radical liberalislamic Left then you will love this book. If you are a sane level headed thinker who is willing to actually research the information presented then this will be a good read as well. It is great to see the Anti U.S. propoganda machine cranking up in full force and watching the snivveling idiots giggling, lapping up this drool and accepting it cold as hard fact instead of what it really is. Anti American Propoganda. It is a great thing we have free speech so that these shackeled minds are revealed for what they truly are."
1,Thieves in High Places,Clearly written by a truth twisting liberal. One who is in bed with Bill and Hillary and part of their propaganda slime and spin machine.
5,Didn't buy as a toy,"This is absolutely adorable. Don't be mislead by my ""stars"" not saying this is a fun toy. I didn't buy it as a toy. My husband is a platypus nut. It so easy to find, cats, dogs, birds etc...when I ran across this little guy I purchased it right away for a little ""stocking stuffer"" for my husband. Once I received it, it was too adorable to be put away until Christmas, so I end up giving it to him that same day. It is very well detailed, and made beautifully. I give it two thumbs up!"
3,Fuller dry mop,"Tle Fuller dry mop is the only sturdy-non plastic, made-in-America similar product on the market. The cotton head does not pick up or hold dust and hair as well as some synthetic heads; however, overall it is a superior tool."
3,Amazon-Fuller mop head,The mop is well constructed and easy to use but the mop head is too sparce in the middle. I was disappointed with the fullness because it looked much thicker in the advertisement. Is the replacement head the same?
4,Review from an Education Major,"Many questions often come up when you attend an university, where public and private schooled students are mixed together in one place to learn. It seems that one student is smarter than another just because they attended a private school. This book helps to dig further into the issue, and really help understand how each school is different from one another, and helps illustrate the pros and cons to each. When faculty and administrators are interviewed the authors find that socioecomomics are the biggest factor in seperating the two types of schools. The level of student success depends a lot on where the school is and how much funding that the school is receiving. School reform often influences our school systems today, and this book ties into that current issue. This book is a very good tool for really understanding the issues that currently effect education today, as well as, using the research and surveys done by the authors to understand where the issue stands."
4,An excellent reading of an underrated opera,"I must admit I was not familiar with most of the singers on this album before I listened to it. However, they give a very strong performance, both in the arias and ensembles. If you're the type who only knows the Te Kanawa's and Domingo's of opera, give this one a listen. The highlight of the recording is Sena Jurinac, who makes a formidable Ilia. The overall sound quality is very good for an older recording, and at two discs for the price of one, it's quite a bargain!"
4,Continually looking for good hypnosis cds.,"The sound quality of this CD is really, really good. So many that I have purchased - the tone is so poor that you have to turn up the player to understand what they are saying. I even purchased the best CD player I could find that had tone-controls. Some hypnosis CD's the person starts out OK then starts to mumble as they get into the program. So this CD you do not have to have loud to be able to understand what is being said. The message is good. Compared to other Hypnosis CDs I've tried though - this does not seem like it's really trying to get at the subconscious. Other CDs will knock me out and you can tell they are truly working. This one has a good message but seems light on the true-Hypnosis. That's the reason for 4 stars and not 5."
3,Not Quite Bright,"I simply love Jesper Dahlback's ""Stockholm Mix Session Vol 1"" (the best chill-house record I've heard), from the excellent Turbo label in Canada, but I can't mask my dissapointment in Vol 2. Hey, I like sexy downtempo but this never even gets to first base. It just plods along at sluggish and odd tempos, never grabs me, never shines. It lacks the transcendent mixes of Vol 1, where I float in a sea of house-bliss.I could say not bad, but who needs average when there's so much great music ou there to enjoy? Instead check out ""Stockholm Mix Vol 1.,"" ""Nude Dimensions Vol 1."" or ""ADNY Selections 2000"" and put your hard-earned money to work for you."
5,From Village Records Catalogue:,"""Bell has pretty much had a stealth type career, but it doesn't seem to have any impact on the quality of his music. On this new recording he's still at the top of his game with his observant lyrics and laid back acoustic approach to the arrangements. If you enjoy subtle, literate songwriting in an acoustic type setting then you'll find much to enjoy on this one."""
5,Best of the Breed,"A scrupulously honest and well-researched history of the Arab-Israeli conflict in the context of the distorted view held by the U.S. public and its policy makers. In light of the recent terrorist attacks and turmoil in the middle east, this books serves as an anchor and guide to our miscast perceptions of playing the ""honest broker"" in the Middle East peace process. Fearful of being labeled anti-Semitic, our congressional leaders roll over at the first sign of pressure tactics from AIPAC. In the past the U.S media has served as a policy tool of the Israeli government as it hoodwinks the US public into sending billions to feed the war machine under the ruse of ""self-defense. I hope reading this book will bring others around to the realization that we need a ""truly"" balanced policy in the Middle East which transcends national politics in the US."
5,Excellent Source,Excellent source for anyone who would like to learn more & know the other side of the Palestinian / Israeli conflict.
1,Garbage ...,"There is nothing objective about this book. The author subscribes to one-sided, conspiratorial views on events in the Middle East. According to author, the failure to achieve peace in the Middle East only has to do with some behind the scenes machinations by ""Zionist Lobby"", This is the same old, recycled garbage continuously put forth in the Middle East by the Arabs and in the West by the likes of various radicals - from National Alliance to Noam Chomsky and Co.The author completely ignores the facts of constant war and terrorism that's been imposed by the Arabs on Israel from its very day of inception. The author also ignores the refusal by most Arab world to recognize the right of Israel to exist. The author refuses to admit that it is the Arabs' militant, intolerant attitude towards Israel that is at least partially responsible for the continuation of this conflict and not the other way around."
1,More anti-semitic drivel from an anti-Israel wacko,"The Palestinian crusade against Israel is fueled by deception, anti-Semitism, Islamic terrorism and the unapologetic rewriting of Middle East history. The pages of this book clearly show this and prove to us why the Palestinians are doing so bad in the PR game.Aside from the obvious bias attitude of the author (she is married to an anti-Israel writer) this book is simply revisionist history, in which the true story is not good enough to tell their children, so they decide to rewrite it to their liking. This book is propaganda filled with lies and ridiculously false statistics, don't waste your time or money with this junk."
1,Poor imitation,"Having watched Lars von Trier's grainy yet mesmeric offerings of The Kingdom, I found the Stephen King collaboration to be distinctly poor. The character depth that is so apparent in The Kingdom is lost in this American commercial cross over with the humour weak and the storyline, different and the show suffers as a result. Save your money and buy Von Trier's original"
4,Why so long on the last episode,"I got to ask why the extra half hour of material from previous episodes?It ruined the pace of the 13th ep.It seemed Like the network steped in and forced them to add scenes from past episodes to make it Longer .Which almost ruined the whole thing.I had to watch most of it with the fast forward button on.And as a previous poster had pointed out, On the third day was totally pointless.If King wants to do the passion of christ,Make another movie.Other wise a great watch for king fans."
2,Why bother??,"Sophomoric, inappropriate, attempts at song and humor, mixedwith a bizarre, confusing, and uninteresting plot, equal abig waste of time for the viewer. A good one to avoid."
1,Bubble Lo @ SF,"This version ruins the original story concept. Lousy production, poor telescript, bad soundtrack, title song. They could have cut a lot of boring scenes to shorten and strengthen the whole story."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTED!,I was very dissapointed to discover after viewing the first of the 4 discs that several scenes have been deleted from the series as broadcast on telivision. What a waste of money to not be able to see the entire show.
1,not even worth renting....,"this is one of those series where u keep telling yourself it'll get better but it never does, its a total disappointment!"
1,Stealing King,"This series is a poorly done, absolute rip-off of the truly bizarre original. It was actually the campy bizarreness of the original that made it worth watching, so what King's left is just a limp imitation. Well, one more obscure book or movie that King's ripped off in hopes that people aren't very smart."
4,Hospital Kingdom,"This DVD, was all it was advertised, the price was very good and the seller sent the product just the way he advertised."
4,Not bad,"Haven't seen the European original mentioned in the other reviews, so I'll have to make comments on its merit. I found the series on the lighter and somewhat comedy/satire side of the house. This is opposed to his other films that are more darker and sinister like Salem's Lot, Cujo, etc. Is this one of his greatest, in my opinion no; however, it is entertaining and worth the money."
4,Not one of my favorites but it had me nonetheless,"This series wasn't one of my favorites from Stephen King but it still had me through the 4-disc series. It's not jumping scary, it's not even mentally scary. It's about a story of a little girl from years and years ago that was basically trapped in the middle plane of life & death. She is able to communicate with certain people in the hospital (the hospital wasn't on those grounds forever). This story can be drawn out at times but never did I ask myself ""when is this going to end?"" That may be because I enjoy the paranormal and story that include such. This is why I didn't mind the series and that I recommend the series to others, not so much to Stephen King fans as I would to those who like paranormal movies. This is not a King scary movie, so if you're looking for that...the blood and guts and jumping...than I suggest picking another movie!"
5,Kingdom Hospital,"Absolutely a hit for Stephen King fans everywhere!!! Even if you aren't a King fan, you will probably enjoy this series! Of course, since I am a die hard King fan, it was great for me!! As per his usual, King can come up with some warped fantasy!"
2,Kingdom Hospital,"A very confusing series, not at all in the same standard as the original Danish version from Trier.Does not capture the original version plot and is not scaring just strange"
2,Looks interesting but its issues plague it,"This show is mediocre and doesn't get any better when u watch it. It consists of these problems:- Has too much weirdness.- Too much filler.- Too many main characters to keep track of, no main character and there's no main antagonist or real conclusion to its plot._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________While this show does have some nice atmosphere, creepy moments as well as one funny part, it's problems that I mentioned above plague the show and keep it from being where near as Scary as the movie: ""Cujo"" (based on Stephen King's novel of the same name) or any other scary movie or show out there. 4.5/10"
1,It's extraordinary how fully King was able to ruin this story,"Lars Von Trier's ""The Kingdom"" is a wildly entertaining piece of made-for-tv cinema of which no one should deprive him/herself. The characters are rich, quirky, and interesting and the tone a unique blend of funny and supernaturally disturbing. King's version is astoundingly poor, making all manner of classic mistakes of vastly overexplaining the blackstory,ludicruously undermining its suspense, drawing its characters far too broadly, failing to achieve the minimal level of craft in the balance and shaping of the story, and a number of other mistakes and bad habits that are trademarks of lesser King efforts. If you watch this, I think you owe it to yourself to watch Von Trier's original version afterward. The latter is so indecently, immodestly superior it amounts to a well-deserved kick in the shins to the producers of this tediously and embarassingly lesser work."
5,love this series,the quality and layout of the dvds was excellent. and the special features were well worth the price.
3,Check out the Danish version of this series,"I watched the Danish version (the title is ""Kingdom"") first and I love it. The characters, plot, and music are just great! My boyfriend loves the Danish version better, too. Whether you like Stephen King's version or not, if you haven't seen the original series, you should definitely check it out(but the DVD available on Amazon is only the first part). It's more creepy and the music effect is way better."
5,Its a great song with a awsome beat,This is one of the best hip hop songs out there. Its got awsome lyrics with a great MC and a sweet beat.
4,Keeps getting better,To be bought after The Beginning DVD collection. Includes story five (story four is not available on DVD) and includes episodes 21-26 of season one. Seems like they've got this whole story line thing down better than the first three stories.
4,It was made in 1964.,It was great. The old Doctor was himself. It contained 1964 special effects and a shoestring budget. It was a classic.
3,Great Fun,"The concept of this story is pretty huge (even for Doctor Who). The quest concept is exciting and fun, but the 5-in-1 storyline suffers from very little development of the 5 in exchange for the overall story of the 1. Still great fun from the innocent family Hartnell era. The Doctor and his companions then were unwilling adventurers and in this particular story, the Doctor himself is absent in two full episodes. I must say I do get frustrated at this early episodes in that I find myself becoming very anbnoyed with the supporting cast... ""No you idiot, look out behind you!"" or ""Now they'll never get back to the TARDIS."" WHere in the later episodes, the doctor is a willing adventurer, in these early stories there is always a major plot device keeping them from just packing up and heading back to the TARDIS. And this one keeps your head spinning. I'd recommend the 1970's as the best Doctor Who, but a fan is no fan without the Hartnell era fully represented."
4,Fun,"The 1st Doctor's shows tend to be a little dry at times. Keys of Marinus almost had a Lost in Space flavor to it. Unlike the Web Planet which made me want to pull my eyes out of my head, and eat them out of sheer boredom, The Keys of Marinus was a much more lively jaunt. I tend to prefer the 2nd Doctor and the 4th, but the 1st Doctor has his days, and this episode is one of them."
3,"""It's Barbara's travel dial: there's blood on it!""","Before there was ever a ""Key to Time"" season, Terry Nation wrote this six episode non-Dalek Who story. After a blooper filled first episode, things start to settle down nicely. All the principle characters are just great, even though the program feels like it still is looking for its identity. Raymond Cusik's design is pretty good. The Voords, well, you can either take them or leave them. Yartek and other Voords are not that well developed in the plot. The most astonishing aspect of the adventure is Hartnell is totally absent in episodes 3 and 4! But he does make a good Matlock before Matlock was even around! A lot better than I remebered! It might not be for everyone's taste. Still, a story not to overlook."
3,"Ambitious, but rewarding....","Sure, the production values are not at their highest but you have to hand it to the team responsible for bringing us the Keys of Marinus, they did a very good job given the shoestring budget.I read the novel of this many years ago and wondered how it would have looked when transmitted on TV in the early 60's. Now with the video release of this story I finally get to see it and it is an enyoable adventure romp which no true blue DW fan's collection should be without."
2,A time travelling mess!,"The Keys of Marinus is a good example of what can go wrong with a new series. Doctor Who was in its infancy, it's first year to be exact. The Keys of Marinus dealt with a series of stories within the story. The Doctor and his companions arrive on Marinus and find they can only leave if they help the keeper of a powerful artifact recover a number of keys that can activate it. The problem is the keys are scattered throughout the planet. The four are given travel watches that transport them to each of the keys locations and thus adventure ensues. The problem is the adventures are boring for the most part. Keys of Marinus us only for the diehard fan."
1,Grimly dull,"My first regret is that I have to give this book a single star. This book has been republished several times. I first saw it in a university library as a Bicentennial reprint. It appears to have been written by a local battle enthusiast who has no talent at all for history. It is so dull that a supreme effort will be required to grind throught it. It's treatment is spotty and in large portions of the book simply confusing. I think it has been around so long because for some reason there are, unlike with Saratoga, Trenton, or Yorktown, no real battle studies of Monmouth. One of the reasons the battle is reduced to stories about Molly Pitcher or of Washington losing his control of himself with Charles Lee is the lack of such studies. This book unfortunately does nothing to fill the gap. I'd pass on this one unless you have a taste for oddities."
3,A disturbing read that makes you look within,"Most if not all stories are disturbing or sad. But it does make any father or son realize there are demons in all of us, yet seldom understood from generation to the next, let alone by our own selves. If anything, perhaps it forces you to reflect on your father's life, your own, and the unanswered questions you will certainly leave to your own kids. The book gave me comfort in the idea that no father can completely fulfill your life, as you will not fulfill your own sons. It is left to the reader to ponder whether this is a fact of life or fault in culture. This book will make you think regardless."
2,"Bag is very tight, hard to take in and out.",This bag is a little small for the projector it says will fit in it.
5,"""Going by Contraries - Robert Frost's Conflict with Science - Under the Sign of Nature"" by Dr. Robert Bernard Hass","""Going by Contraries"" examines Robert Frost's poetry through the lens of nature and ecocriticism by presenting Frost's conflict with science. Robert Bernard Hass, PhD shows us the conflicts Frost wrestled with by providing arguments of scientific and philosophical theorists, such as Darwin, Bergson, T.S. Eliot, and many others. The book explores Frost's creative resources for writing and the inspiration behind his legendary poetry with examples including ""West Running Brook,"" from where the title ""Going by Contraries"" was obviously conceived. Hass' book illustrates how scientific influence was inevitable in Frost's poetry because science was gaining popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; that is, during the time Frost did a significant amount of his writing. If you are into nature and literary theory, this book is a good place to start.6/30/2008 Martha J. Rogus"

4,under- appreciated master,"Frank Frazetta is not only the master of Fantasy art but one of the true fathers of todays artist (Vallejo, Mcfarlane, Hildebrant) his body of work has ranged from the early comic strips of the 50's , to the great interpretation of Fantasy heroes greatest, Tarzan, Conan, Kane and many others, but he has also created some of the most memorable images of the 20th century Sci-Fi and Fantsy art(Deathdealer and so on). This bookk ends a wonderful trilogy that started with Icon, and was followed by Legacy, those previous volumes introduced many to the great worlds depicted in Frazetta's paintings, this book is a treasure chest of less known but just as great works. True longtime fans of this great master will relish this additions to the already establish body of work. I urge all fans of the master to also visit his museum in Stroudsburg PA to view the original paintins in all their greatness."
5,Delicious,"AMAZING. My roommate asked me for one of these everyday- I think I got her addicted. I remembered them from my childhood and looked them up on Amazon, and what do you know, they still existed. Do Not disappoint."
5,best batmobile eva!,"The defnitive batmobile from the keaton era. diecast, sliding canopy, hidden rail guns and above all that, the engine pulls out! no regrets after getting one."
5,Loved It!,"Saw Igor in the theater when it came out and just had to have it. This movie is fun for kids and adults. And it's more fun for the adults, because we get more of the jokes. Well worth the purchase."
3,moderatly entertaining,as an animation fan the story line kept my attention enojoyed the ideas but wasnt a fan of the computer animation
3,Not what I was expecting,I was very excited about this movie when I preorderd it. It has some very funny characters and lines in it but for me the story just didnt fit and it seemed that by the end of the movie I couldnt wait for it to be over because of the story. The visuals were great but didnt make up for the story.
2,Couldn't finish it!,"As others have said great animation but the story line IS lacking any believability. Most movies give you a set up to get you started at the beginning. I never quite identified with Igor who wanted to be an evil scientist and had no choice from the beginning because of the hump on his back.It is just OK in that the characters are cute and it's speedy pace is aimed at keeping kids entertained, but it isn't smart with kid appropriate adult humor like Toy Story. My husband and I tried to watch it to the end but couldn't make it. My 8 year old daughter fell asleep but made the effort to finish it later. Her review was it was ""It was O.K. I'll watch it again.""I think this one will be forgotten soon."
3,not a bad horror spoof,"This one I want to be great, was disappointed in that respect but overall, despite the bad lighting (in a CGI movie to boot) Igor is an original cartoon. Don't expect any textures or curves in this boxy, shiny and stylized account of an Igor who wants to be a scientist. The rabbit and brain sidekicks are the best part of the movie, the big Bride of Frankenstein showgirl I thought to be the drawback, and she was supposed to be the big joke.Not the worst CGI I ever saw but with the material at hand the possiblities they blew are astounding."
5,Slow starting but well worth the time.,I had meant to see this in the theatre but never got the chance. I ended up buying it sight unseen which can be risky but I really enjoyed it. It takes some time to build up steam but once it gets there it really is quite funny and the animation is well done for a non-pixar film. I recently saw more of Steve Bucsemi's voice work in Monster House and was impressed with his work here.The comic load is mostly carried by him but the entire cast put in good effort. A very well made film.
3,Story of my life,"This is DEFINITELY NOT a movie for kids.I don't like horror, but enjoyed it because it felt like it was telling the story of my life, growing up in a cult. Definitely NOT a kids movie."
3,I Don't get it,"Ok I am going to start off by saying this movie is not bad it is just average - it wasn't that interesting a story and the characters didn't really ""grab"" me so maybe that affected my decision. To give you an Idea of where I'm coming from, I didn't really like the movie Caroline much either, despite my trying to very hard. Once again, this is not a bad movie per se and if you collect movies like this (like i do) you might want to pick it up."

2,"Great Animation, Lame Script","It's a shame the story and script aren't up to the level of the animation.A movie with a Moral (i.e. Evil Is Bad), I'm not sure exactly at whom it's aimed. Too smarmy for kids, too dumb for adults, it ends up being for ... well, a few of the other good folks who reviewed and liked it, I guess. There's no accounting for taste, said the old lady as she kissed the cow."
1,NOT FOR KIDS!!! My 4-year-old had nightmares,"This movie was absolutely terrible! It is not suitable for children of any age. We walked out of the theatre, but I wish we would have done so sooner. I think we must have been in shock that ANYONE thinks it is okay to market this as a kids movie. From the 'Axe Murderer Brainwash' scene, to the cleavage shots, to the suicidal bunny, to talk of blowing heads off, it was horrible all the way around! And when Eva turns evil my two kids were both terrified! My daughter had nightmares and had to sleep in my bed!Horrible horrible horrible movie! I can't even express enough what an awful movie this was! Don't let the fact that this is an animated movie fool you. It truly is not appropriate for children! DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE FOR YOUR CHILDREN!!!"
1,HORRIBLE,The worst and most overrated movie since Nightmare Before Christmas.At times it seems like it's the same movie.Just terrible.
3,Climate Change Issues,"It is a popular in Australia animation about a Slavic-name-called commoner who liberated his folks from a monarchy by destroying a rain-only-in-nature scum a climate-related reign had been based upon.Nice music, nice plot also it is a bit long and too sophisticated not for kids only."
2,"Not really a good kids movie, or entertaining enough for adults","I was very dissappointed by this movie. Granted I knew it wasn't a blockbuster, but the whole story was flawed. The main character's companion bunny spends the entire movie depressed and trying to kill himself, but he's been genetically modified to be unkillable. So he goes through various means of trying to commit suicide and keeps living, which makes him unhappy-er. Great for kids, huh? Then the whole premise of creating things to blackmail the world to pay their town was pretty adult concept. I didn't find a whole lot of humor in the story either. I really didn't want to have my little kids (5 & 8) watching a movie where one of the characters is depressed and tries to kill himself, but after starting the movie was in an awkward situation as kids love movies. They seemed to take it stride, but I was cringing. I would not bother with this one~!"
2,A huge waste of a great cast,"My eight-year-old son talked me into picking this up the other day. I'd never heard of it, but when I saw the cast (John Cusack! John Cleese! Jennifer Coolidge! Steve Buscemi! Sean Hayes! And the icing on the cake, the one and only Eddie Izzard as the villian!!!!), I asked myself ""How bad can it be?""And the answer? Not awful. No, it's too dull and boring to be awful.The stellar cast does its best with a mediocre (at best) script. And the animation design is interesting, even if it is pretty much a shiny rip-off of the style of Nightmare Before Christmas (the king in this looks uncannily like the mayor in Nightmare, without any of the cleverness).I could go on and on about all the things wrong with this movie, but all that matters is that the end result is a huge waste of the movie studio's money. Don't fall into the same trap.Move along folks, nothin' to see here....."
4,LOL hilarious!,"I want to give it 5 Stars because the screenplay is SO funny but I don't care for the animation - reminiscent of Nightmare Before Xmas.It's like this movie was MADE for the dry genius wit of Steve Buscemi. He just SHINES in this. (He's a rabbit.)I believe they cut the ending too short. Sweet little last joke but instead of kind of fading out so we could enjoy it, the filmmakers just cut it short and went to new song and the credits.A good premise and a nice family film. But maybe too scary for under 9 yrs of age."
1,Igor review,"I was looking forward to watching this when it arrived HOWEVER, it's the wrong region and I can't watch it. So now have to onsell it and hope I can get one for New Zealand. Nothing in the add mentioned what region it was for. As such I am unable to comment on the actual movie."
4,Did not need,"I can't rate this high or low. I purchased a Kitchen Aide garbage disposal (which I love) and I knew it did not come with all of the connections. I hired a local handyman for installation; when he was done, he said he did not need these. He is a great maintenance man, so I have to think these weren't needed or he used the old ones, or they didn't work for my unit. In any case, he was very pleased when I suggested he keep the kit for future repairs and I had to use for it. So for his smile and what he was getting, 4 stars"
3,OK,"There wasn't room to use the connector kit, but it might be useful under other circumstances. Buy it if you absolutely need it after your install, but not before."
3,Very Basic Kit,"This was a good deal for the price and did come in handy when installing the disposer. The directions were almost too basic... It took several reads to figure out which pieces they were referring to and when, and where to put each clamp, etc. Not sure i could expect much more from the small amount of space on the back of the package. Would have been nice if they came with a more detailed folded insert or something, like the power cord."
3,You may not need this,We are doing a kitchen remodel and this part was not necessary as the dishwasher came equipped for fastening onto the InSinkErator. Going to return it.
5,Very useful for DIY,A must buy to DIY installation of Dishwasher. Save time and money by buying it all together to complete the installation
5,A Really Nice Lotion,"I've been using this lotion for years, and will go out of my way to find it.Very nice, fresh, sweet smelling yet not too strong. Nice moisturizer."
3,Lotion,"The product that I ordered was in the origonal green bottle. The pictures on line shows a green bottle. The lotion came with a white bottle,even though the lotion says it has the same ingrediants, it is not the same consistancy as the original lotion."
4,"Doing it with class, cause I got a big ass.","So I'll be the first to admit that season 1 is more entertaining than season 2...but I'll be completely honest here, this show could become the worst show on television and I'd still watch it. Luckily though, it's not the worst show on television. Season 2 is still great. The dvd however is lacking. Just as the first season on dvd, it is censored and lacking in extras. But for the price, I'd say it's worth the purchase."
1,can anyone get any lower in life,I must say these people are the worst of the worstdo they really belief I would pay this much money for garbagethese shameless talentless parasite keep milking the public for money
4,purpose of this book is for women's voices to be heard!,"As one of the ""Daughter of a different path"" myself, I understood the reading to NOT be a scholarly text on women's issues in Islam, but more of a message board for Muslim converts and their parents to just tell their story. The purpose of the book is to allow Muslim converts to relate with the stories, and for non-Muslims to listen to them. Some readers may not agree with the views expressed by the Muslim women in the book. However, the author is a devout Christian and obviously created this book to not preach Islam but to just publish a piece that reflects the views of women converts of Islam. I fully appreciated the purpose and outcome of this book.I did not give the book five stars because, as mentioned in other reviews, it had a very ""cut-and-paste"" feel to it."
4,Very helpful for understanding what a convert's family goes through,"After I converted to Islam, I came across this book. I read it and found it interesting, but in discussing it with a non-Muslim relative whom I am close with, I realized that the author's experiences with her daughter's conversion hit closer to home in my life than I realized. My relative identified strongly with her emotional reactions (though he's not Christian) to her daughter's conversion and to her daughter's adoption of the Islamic headcovering and modest dress. This book really helped me understand the ways in which those around me have struggled with my conversion, and helped me to talk to them in ways that facilitated communication and understanding, rather than put up barriers. I highly recommend it for recent converts and their families and friends."
5,Informative and Useful,"I have been a muslim for over 6 years and found this book to be veryinteresting. I understand how non-muslims and Americans feel aboutIslam because I am an American and was once christian. I have readthis book many times. My friends from Arabia have even found this bookuseful. As a white American woman converted to Islam I struggle veryday for acceptance and understanding from a very narrow minded societythat views Islam as backward and barbaric. If more would pick up thisbook or the Koran, then maybe they would have a better understandingof Islam and mulsims. It should be know that not all muslims convertedas a direct cause of a man and that no one can be forced to convert toIslam..... Great book and a good read."
5,good book in understanding the journey,"This is a great book, which gives an account of the daughter who converts from Christianity to Islam. This book is a very good for anyone who's family member converted to Islam"
3,Interesting update,I was intrigued by the story of Carol and her daughter and I really wanted an update now that 15 years has passed since this book was written.I stumbled upon a blog post from 1996 from Emaun Mohammadzadeh who readers will recall as the first child of Jodi and Reza. He gave a little description of his family saying he lives with his Father and Stepmother who are Muslim and then mentions his Mother's family (names a Stepfather) are Christian. Emaun states he does not follow any religion.If you are interested here is the site:[...]I just wish I could find any information on Jodi to see what happened to end the marriage.
3,Not Quite What I Expected...,"When I purchased this book, I was surprised to find that it read more as a personal account of one woman's struggle to come to terms with her daughter's conversion to Islam from Christianity, then as a collection of essays by Islamic women about why they chose to convert. While this aspect of the book exists, I found the excerpted nature of the material, along with the author's piecemeal (and rather non-committal) commentary to leave me flat, wishing for more details about the individual Muslim women and their stories. This book is interesting, but not compelling, and I would recommend it more for people facing the same situation as the author -- committed Christians who are trying to come to terms with a loved one's conversion to the Islamic faith -- than I would to anyone striving to gain a deep understanding of what Islam means to those who have converted."
3,Reissue doesn't do it justice,"I heard this recording many years ago on a mid to late 1950s RCA issue. That four LP version was absolutely complete, including the fourth act arias for Marcellina and Basilio. It is a shame that EMI decided to alter Gui's concept in the re-issue. I guess they felt this venerable recording couldn't compete as a budget 3 disc issue. Torso though it is, the recording is worth acquiring for Jurinac's Countess alone."
2,More A&E Editing Nonsense,A&E; strikes again. Buyers beware. Some 25 minutes have been edited out of this mini-series because A&E; is lazy and just takes the edited versions they aired on television and burned them to disk. If you have a region free DVD player get the version from the UK that is 25 minutes longer.

3,vanity fair--,The acting was mediocre. The story just wasn't what I wanted it to be. There is a bit of nudity which was unnecessary. I don't know which movie is closer to the book but if I had to pick one I would choose the newest one with Reese Witherspoon. It just had a better and more dramatic ending. The production was a decent one and that is the best I can give it.
2,Not a great English Movie,I thought Vanity Fair was a baudry and cheap movie that lasted to long. I feel I wasted my money on buying it.
1,Vulgar!!,Vulgar is the only word that completely describes this film. I have never been so sickend by a period movie. The first shot of the movie shows a woman picking her nose. It does not get any better later in the film. The music is hidious also. Don't bother!
5,A fabulous production.,"Vanity Fair is far from the usual 19th Century novel, most deal with themes of misery, scorn, lost love and dejected women.Becky Sharp in contrast is a go getter of a girl, fueled by her anger at having all the disadvantages of low birth weighing heavy around her neck, she sets a course for the riches and rewards she thinks she deserves with ruthless abandon.Becky is kind of 19th Century Alexis Carrington (Dynasty) and is exqusitely played by Natasha Little who is beautiful, engaging, seductive and a real little monster all at once."
2,could not get through 1st episode,"I tried to watch this series, but could not get past the first episode. I found the acting to be quite contrived (that is the point in the novel) but I could not get past the shallow characters. Maybe fans of the novel would fare better."
1,Cirque du Soleil meets A Clockwork Orange,"It's beyond me why anyone would rate this disgusting piece of tripe w/five stars. It doesn't even rate one star in my opinion. The acting is admirable but there are things in the miniseries itself which are not, such as showing a woman picking her nose and rolling around the contents between her fingers in the opening scene, an obsession w/slobbering buck teeth on a couple of the men, one of whom literally sucks face w/his new daughter-in-law, freakish makeup on everyone including Becky and that music! my God, that music! If I never hear a trumpet again, it'll be too soon. I actually muted the TV and read the closed captioning so that I could power through to the end. I'm going to start reading the one star reviews first from now on. Had I done so w/this ""messterpiece"", I could've saved myself a lot of aggravation, nausea and money."
5,Great in every way,Perfect casting and acting. Good script. Beautiful presentation. Distinctive music and tone. It makes other series look stodgy and dull.
5,Best of the film versions,"This the best of the several movie versions of Vanity Fair, which is one of my favorite novels. The writers have done a thoughtful job selecting from among the numerous episodes and plotlines in the book, and, as one would expect from a British production, the acting is superb. Particularly notable are the Becky Sharp (a lovely creature) and William Dobbin, who has to ""say"" a great deal without talking. After seeing it on TV, I bought the set so I can watch it repeatedly. There has been considerable criticism of the music; I found it not particularly special but easy to ignore."
5,MAGNIFICENT PRODUCTION!!,"Simply put: a magnificent rendering of the novel. One can't imagine any other filmic incarnation. The casting is astonishing, right down to each and every extra. The editing and direction are impeccable. And the music is so spectacularly appropriate, even though its raucousness - at times - seems so twentieth century. This of course helps the production stay fresh and modern, whilst absolutely nailing the society and period it depicts.A truly ragingly funny adaptation - rampant with human foibles and greed, vicious and deliciously bold, heartbreakingly tender and beguiling.Andrew Davies is indeed a very, very capable screenwriter. And Marc Munden a decidedly gifted director."
4,"Entertaining, well-adapted Victorian drama","This is a well-made adaptation of Thackeray's Victorian drama - sumptious sets and costumes, good acting, high production values. This was produced and written by the people behind Pride & Prejudice - and while I enjoyed this - it certainly does not compare to P&P. Natasha Little is splendid as Becky Sharp though I was disappointed that the actress who played Amelia Sedley wasn't ""pretty enough"" and the film's plot does tend to ""jump around"" a bit. If you're looking for a more satisfying, enjoyable Victorian drama, check out ""Middlemarch"" (starring Rufus Sewell and Juliet Aubrey) or ""Great Expectations"" (starring Ioan Gruffud) instead."
2,Technically the worst dvd I have ever watched,"I can not give an accurate criticism of this adaptation of Vanity Fair because I have only watched the first 25 minutes of the movie. I stopped watching and began writing this review because I wanted to warn people that the picture quality contained on this dvd is worse than bad. My 36 inch television showed so many video artifacts that it became distracting. I can accept the fact that it is only available in pan & scan, what I can not accept is picture quality so bad and un-even that it looks as if it were dubbed from an old vhs tape. The people at A&E really need to take a close look at how they master their dvd releases. I have also purchased Pride and Prejudice from them and I can tell you that, while it is one of my favorite productions, the dvd quality is sub-par (but nowhere near as bad as Vanity Fair). If you buy this release expecting dvd quality sound and picture, you will be disappointed."
4,Interesting.,"Something that should probably be listed on the product's description is that it is crotchless, yes that was a surprise. The only problem I had with this product is that it is made of faux and should therefore be less expensive because the faux material is not durable in the least. Within my first ten minutes of wearing it, just looking and examining it, there was already a snag/tear along one of the legs. Faux, for those of you who don't know, is that material that cheap, easily torn pantyhose are made out of, that's why I gave this a four-star rating instead of a five. Otherwise, it fit well, was a beautiful piece and I enjoyed it.. but for almost eleven dollars I should be able to have it for more than one use, now that it is ripped, it's virtually useless. See my point?"
2,Small,"i like it, but just warning you it is a size small, more so than a one size fits all. i am small but busty, my bust wont fit in this."
1,Trash,"This thing is going to have to go into the trash. I can never wear it. I'm 5'8"" (but thin) so maybe if you're 5' this would work for you. The triangle part for the bra top didn't reach up to my boobs, even with a ton of stretching. The part that goes around your neck is a thin little string that is not adjustable and is way too long. The whole stocking is not as dark black as it looks in the picture but waaaay more sheer. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,Nice Product but Cheaply made,This product is good to look at but far too sheer to wear more than one or two times without ripping.
4,reissue of classic frist album,"this is a re-issue of the first yume bitsu album that was orriginally released on ba da bing in the summer of 1998. refined cover art is a nice addition. deep fuzz, pop moments, ambient synth washes, vocal harmonies and prelimiary explorations into the vessyl.."
4,Never Far From The Surface,"Mixing together a broth of (sometimes) heavy and (mostly)light drones generated both by guitar and keyboard, Yume Bitsu can build toward a sustained sort of explosiveness on their first release, but often elect to spend time exploring ambient space. All of the ingredients that would later contribute toward the strong presence of their eponymous sophomore release (almost universally regarded as their masterpiece) and ""Auspicious Winds"", their third CD are here in a more elemental form, including whimsical track titles and extensive running length for more than half of the cuts. If you're looking to start with Yume Bitsu, I'd recommend ""Yume Bitsu"" (the aforementioned self-titled seccond release), but ""Giant Surface Music Falling to Earth Like Jewels"" is definitely worthy of your time, whether you're new to the whole space rock phenomenon, or just a rabid completist. Grab one while they're still remotely affordable; you won't be sorry."
3,great documentation,"good documentation of chicago equiptment.,no match tho for the four set of books put out by ken little and fatherjohn mcnalis, the history of chicago fire houses. volumn 1 thru 4. these books are shure to become collectors items."
5,Vibrant Vivaldi,"Vivaldi is played with excitement by Europa Galante, a string and woodwind orchestra 13 strong here. Some collections of Vivaldi concertos can sound a bit monotonous, but not this carefully selected group of emotively titled short pieces. Instrumentation is varied, the playing is enthusiastic and energetic as needed, and the strings really bite in the staccato ""Sea Tempest,"" the waves slapping hard on the boat. The 6-movement ""Night"" is remarkably eerie and ghostly, particularly if you can cleanse your ears of all the chromatic pieces written since and try to listen with 18th century expectations. RV 234 is full of unsettling ""Apprehension"" no matter what later music you have heard, displaying a harried and rapidly modulated sense of harmonic uncertainty. The brief notes with the CD are a slightly strange mixture of English and untranslated Italiano. Fresh and well worth listening closely."
1,What a disappointment!,"If it was the late eighties instead of the late nineties, this would have been very original. But this has all been done before. Great music though, it would be better if the singer sung more naturally, instead of trying to sound like Cher.This would be a good one to pick up in the used bin."
2,meets all standards but,"This is a simple ,easy to use player but for one outstanding fault. The rechargeable battery only holds a charge for about an hour. Since it is lithium ion and not replaceable this is a big problem. I wonder if other users have had this problem? Should have bought a Creative Zen. There batteries are replaceable."
3,OK workout,I'm not crazy about this workout. First you need specialty equipment that the common person will not have handy. You will need a medicine ball and Indian Club. I didn't even know what that is but it is a small bat or club in different weights.
4,Excellent choice,This is the right book with just the right amount of preparatory review for the AP exam. This book challenged me and has been very useful. I strongly recommend it.
3,James Horner Seemed Afraid of Copying Himself,"I rented the video today and the first thing I did, being a huge Horner fan, was FF to the end title music.It started off just beautiful, but after about 20 seconds, it seemed to veer off and copy ""Legends of the Fall"" and then Horner would pull it back. Then it would sound like some of his other scores and he would pull it off another direction. I think he must read his reviews on Amazon and everyone seems to have a beef with his music sounding the same, but I don't care because it's all just so beautiful. However, when he tries to veer away from himself, it just ends up with NO memorable melody.I'm on the fence about buying this one. I may wait until there's nothing else to buy. Don't play safe, Mr. Horner, just write the beautiful music that you write!"
4,purchased for MGA,"I ordered this for a 1957 MGA that I am restoring. It worked out very well. The quality is good, and it can be adjusted any way you like. I mounted it on the frame of the windshield on the driver's side.The only knock on this is that I have since learned that there is a convex mirror version, which I think would be more useful. I also later found a pair of these for sale on line, which would have been a better deal....so shop around!I am overall very pleased with the purchase, however, and the shipping was prompt."
5,perfect,"great album. all of the ballads are so good. if you have kids or ever want to have kids, listen to ""i wanna be there"". best song on the album. ""pictures"" is a song that is worth buying the album too. ""four wheel drive"" my be the funniest song ever. you should be over 18 to listen to it. ha ha. ""love changes everything"" and ""got you to thank for that"" are great mid tempo songs that i can't stop playing. ""country thang"" is a great song too...good luck trying to learn the words to it. ""believe in me"" is another jmm ballad that never gets old. don't have a bad thing to say about the album. definitely buy it."
5,AWESOME!,"This CD is awesome! I don't agree with those who think ""Country Thang"" isn't that great. I LOVE Country Thang! I think it'll be great as a single! This whole CD is awesome. If you havent got it yet, do so! You won't be disappointed! ;) I don't think John gets the respect and airtime he deserves. He's such a great guy, and very talented, he's truly thankful for what he's got and cares about his fans! Way to go John Michael, you got another winner here! :)"
4,Has been very overlooked for years,John Michael Montgomery has always been my favorite country singer next to George Strait. John Michael's music has always though received less attention than deserved though he saw big success with Life's a Dance and Kickin it up but after those albums he kind of was always a second class artist. Big Mouths like Garth Brooks and Tim Mcgraw really yanked success for alot of artists in this buisness. Pictures is just another great album by this guy he sings what he does best on this record and that is ballads. Every song has something good to give although one track stinks Country Thang it just isn't John Michael Montgomery and is what stops this album from getting 5 stars his voice is too deep on this track and it is a ...song I also heard it is going to be his next single that is to bad because there are about 8 worthy singles on this record and I can't believe that song would go as a single. Great album though really good sound.
2,Boring....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I purchased this cd expecting a solid group of songs from JMM. However, this album really lacks when it comes to good material. There really isn't one song that stands out, nothing worth playing over and over. The entire album is pretty much ""blowing flowers out of your [rear end]"" types of songs. The title cut, ""Pictures"" is about a guy that likes to take pictures of his family and looks forward to taking more. It sounds like something an 8 year old wrote. Rather than wasting 15 bucks on this cd, get a Pat Green or Brad Paisley cd, they are much more worth your money."
5,Kids love it!,"My children saw the first Halloween Town on TV years ago and I was just browsing on-line and found all of them here on Amazon. My kids were ecstatic then and they still are now. We make it a Halloween time tradition to keep them in the van to watch as we ride back and forth to school and on trips. Good, clean entertainment."
4,return to halloweentown,"miss Kimberly, but the movie has details concerning the whole series. Hope there is more to come"
3,"It's Ok, but not great.","I and my daughter are a huge fan of the ""Halloweentown"" movies. We were both disappointed about the fact that Kimberly J. Brown didn't reprise her role as Marnie Piper. Sara Paxton is okay, but she had some big shoes to fill in my opinion since Kimberley did such a great job in the previous 3 movies. If you have seen the first 3 and not this one, I would advise you to check it out on Disney channel first before buying it."
5,HalloweenTown 4,I love to watch all HalloweenTown and this teach us more about Crowell family's past.
5,Great quality and fast shipping,I was impressed with how easy and fast it was to find and order this movie and it arrived ontime and in one piece. I got a good description on the product and pictures to show me it was the correct product i was buying. I will make sure to buy from amazon in the future they have great prices.Daniel Mahoney
5,"No, it's not Kimberly Brown, but give it a chance","When this came out on television, I immediately dismissed it since Kimberly Brown was not Marnie this time. However, over time, I have come to really enjoy this video. Sara Paxton plays a good Marnie along with doing the part of the younger Splendora Cromwell. Judith Hoag is back again as the mother, and she has more of a role this time. I was a bit disappointed that Sofie was out of the story along with Debbie Reynolds making only a brief appearance or two.All that aside, it is a good story and worthy of adding to your HalloweenTown video collection."
3,Stick With the Originals!!!,"This sequel is a small step up from the last. For starters, Kimberly J. Brown is replaced as Marnie. Sophie doesn't even appear, and Debbie Reynolds only makes small guest appearances as Aggie. At least we see Halloweentown again, and Marnie discovers her past as she goes back in time to find out who Splendora Cromwell was, and see how Halloweentown got its huge pumpkin. Marnie and Dylan go to Witch University and the teachers and students don't exactly roll out the 'welcome wagon' Marnie is forced to use an ancient family heirloom to rule the town. If you love the series, you might wanna RETURN TO HALLOWEENTOWN!!!"
4,Return To Halloweentown...,"This is a pretty good kids movie...My daughter LOVES all the Halloweentown movies but was a little disappointed that Marnie was a different girl...Dillon was in it, but Sophie was not a major player...Very disappointing...Maybe another Halloweentown with Dillon? and Sophie?GOOD MOVIE!"
2,Pretty lame for something about traveling and Zen,"The book was a disappointment. 'Travel and Zen'... what beautiful topics, yet the book is not beautiful at all. Full of disconnected pictures and a weird story about this guy's life that is very choppy. The book does not flow at all. I read about 40 pages and then decided to get rid of it. Look for something else.."
1,Not worth the paper its printed on,"What an utter disappointment. There is nothing Zen about it, the meditations are uninspiring and the anecdotes are dull. Don't bother with this one."
1,I'm disappointed,"I bought my first Modern Jazz Quartet LP in 1959, and have always enjoyed Percy Heath's contribution to the sound. I have purchased several more recordings by the MJQ including the 40th Anniversary boxed set. Unfortunately, this opus, the final recording by the last MJQ member who passed on, was not what I expected."
2,Far From The Best Of Little Walter,"This album is far from the best of Little Walter. These songs were recorded during his pre-amplification days. J.B. Lenoir is perhaps the single most over-rated Blues musician in history, thus I dread hearing his performances on this album. If you're interested in finding out what's so great about Little Walter, buy a Muddy Waters Chess Records compilation and/or ""Confessin' The Blues"", a wonderful Little Walter cd. ""Rollin' & Tumblin'"" saves this album from being a total bore, as it is some of the most emotive, amazing, sensational, post-World War II Blues in existence!"
3,"overly-indulgent, but a good read","""Plays Well with Others"" is a well-crafted, well-told story, but I though the author over-idealized his subjects to such a point that I never found myself invested in them. I felt hammered repeatedly by Gurganus' proclamations of how talented Robert, Hartley and Angie were and what a great loss to the world it was to have these artists taken out of the world - because their demise would have been less of a tragedy if they had been any less great? I just didn't buy into how perfect everything was before ""it"" happened, and consequently I didn't buy into the characters.That said, there are parts of the novel that are fantastic and it was really a good read."
3,Slice of literary pecan pie,"Like most southern authors, Alan Gurganus lays on the purple prose with a thick trowel. The result is sometimes too rich, a Literary Pecan Pie. The opening scene of this novel mixes death and hilarity into an intense confection, then the pace slows down considerably. The narrator constantly tells us how beautiful and talented his protagonists are, but shows very little of these gifts. When disaster finally strikes, he skims overthe surface of their suffering."
2,unbelievable,"Like the New York Times review says, this is just unbelievable. Gurganus' writing is episodically thrilling, but the best bits are strewn like chunks through the text, and the characters are ridiculously drawn (I ask you: a cipher called HARVEY MIMS?). I felt excluded and patronised, and I have to be honest: I didn't finish it. It seemed like too much of a long haul for a story and characters I cared little about."
4,"My trip down memory lane -- Allan played well with me, too.","I've seen Allan Gurganus only once since high school -- at a local book signing for ""Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All."" For quite a while, I have wanted to let Allan know how much his warmth and humor meant to me during a time when not much else made me smile. Upon learning that he was scheduled to read from ""Plays Well With Others"" at New York's New School, I cashed in a few thousand frequent flyer points and booked my flight. I was not disappointed either by Allan's book or by his performance. I believe honesty to be a key element for a successful story. ""Plays Well With Others"" is one of THE most honest (and compelling) love stories I've ever read. It continually reminded me of the things that endeared me to Allan many years ago. It took courage for him to write this book -- more to have it published. I'm grateful for having read it. Thank you, Allan -- again."
2,Difficult and laborous reading,"I have to admit - this is my first Allan Gurganus book - and if it were his first - I wouldn't bother with his next. However, his first novel gathered such good reviews - it makes me curious to go buy the ""CONFEDERATE"" novel and see if it's as difficult and laborous a read as PLAYS WELL WITH OTHERS. I myself am tired of all the gay novels telling me how pretty everyone was, how sexy they were, and how much piggy sex was had during the late 70's and early 80's - and now all doomed and dead! What about the average gay guy who lived and died in Indianpolis - yeah - Indianpolis isn't that exciting - but it might make a better story than three boring people in New York who only think of themselves. Mr. Gurganus has left me cold and bored with his new book."
2,What a letdown!,"I was really excited that a new novel had been written by the author of OLDEST LIVING CONFEDERATE WIDOW. Maybe I anticipated too much, but no way does this book live up to its predecessor. WIDOW brought me into the world of the American South and helped me to understand so much of the experiences of the people who lived through the Civil War and of the mind set of their descendents. PLAYS WELL talked about the New York art scene of the 1980's, but I always felt like Gurganus was treating me like an outsider who could never really understand what it was like. There were some amazingly touching scenes (such as when the narrator first notices his friend's telltale ""spot"") that serve to remind us of the level of writing Gurganus is capable of achieving, but those moments are way too few for me to recommend this book."
2,thin,"We bought 4 of these glasses a while back because we loved the design. They are really pretty and bottom heavy so they won't tip, however they taper as they get to the top. Because of this they are so very thin on top that they chip extremely easily. It's hard to wash them and dry them and also I found I had to be very careful when putting them back into the cabinet so that you don't knock it into a shelf. I felt that if you breathed on them to hard they might chip.We had 4 and now we have none since they have all chipped or cracked. I will be looking for different ones."
5,Great with 100 Acre Woods Background !,This was great for our 1 year old's birthday !!! We added these and other Pooh characters to the 100 Acre Woods Background and he absolutely loved it --- and so did all of the guests (both young and old)!!!
1,Lemon,"Purchased this TV three years ago. Now getting red static on a consistent basis regardless of input source (cable, xbox, etc). Repairs are out of warranty and will run about $600. Sending this one to the recycle gods."
5,excellent plasma good price,great quality for price. My only complaint is remote cannot be programmed to use other devices.
5,Helpful Guide,"This book gave my son the confidence he needed and ne scored a ""4"" on the exam. I recommended it to all of my friends whose students will be taking this exam."
1,Don't be fooled,"This is a live CD. The band got together to jam and the songs are not the ones you've heard on the radio, only poor imitations.I ordered the songs I really wanted from I-tunes."
4,Not so bad,"I thought the movie was okay. The only thing I didn't like is the fact the girl sold them out. I feel that Milk had no other options with the mistakes he made. He was being harassed by the junkie and he didn't mean for him to fall and die. I felt he was doing the right thing in defending his dog. I believe the man stealing from his grandmother had it coming. I don't think he had a choice. It would have eventually been him. He was NOT a cold-blooded killer. I think I would have done the same thing. I thought the police brutality was bad, but it does exist."
1,don't waste your time!,"Boring, predictable story. Half the time you couldn't understand them ...screaming or whispering. And you didn't even care that you didn't catch everything because the story was so ridiculous."
3,Enjoyed!!!,DONT THINK WAS A POPular movie...but I watched it & enjoyed it..had touching moments & kept me interested in it! Actors did a fine job.would have given 3 n half .if I could
3,The Son of No One,"Another cast of a few great and historical actors, but yet another predictable ending. I enjoyed the movie, but would have preferred a more interesting ending."
2,Waste of good actors...,All these great actors (with the exception of Tracy Morgan) and the movie was boring. The teen actors were especially good. Lame camera work and Tracy Morgan? Really? What 50-cent or Ludacris where busy???
2,"If they aren't screaming, they're whispering",Sub par acting with a so so script. Seems everyone took a lesson from the Alec Baldwin school of whisper-acting. A lame way to create intensity... Where there is none to be had. Bloated and not worth your time
3,FirePlace Heater,"I was very disappointed when this arrived, it is way too small, does not work all that well and way overpriced. A friend of mind has one similar to this but it's much larger, works great and cost the same. I feel I was ripped off yet again by another on line store."
1,uncaring customer service,I was very dissappointed to find out that my Christmas gift was cancelled on Dec 20 without so much as an offer for an equivelant item. I placed my order on Dec 13th. Plenty of time to receive my gift. This company never informed me about the item being out of stock until it was too late to purchase it from some where else.They are still listing the item as in stock.
2,Disappointed,"I first heard Darol Anger and Mike Marshall from the Montreux albums ""Let Them Say"" and ""Sign Language"". I enjoyed those albums and repurchased them recently. That's when I saw the this album, and thought I would try it. Anger and Marshall are excellent musicians, but Woodshop lacked the sense of joy that was on the Montreux works. I will put Woodshop on the shelf and let it sit."
1,Why not to try Ivan Moravec's?!,This recording is not convincing if you compare it to Ivan Moravec's rendition of it and is also considered the best rendition of Chopin's Nocturnes.
4,I got to see it,I saw it on a pirate (arghh!) web site. Visual wasn't great but okay. Maybe after they drop the price I will buy it.
1,Worthless in the USA,"If anyone is interested in this DVD don't waste your money. When I put the DVD in the machine a rectangular box with a blue background and white writing stating ... REGION ERROR. Yes I checked the product information and read the real small print that appeared in the Seller box before ordering and it stated ALL REGIONS. And the Run Time for a complete series is MORE than 83 minutes. Someone just got $45.00 for free. Don't even try to tell me what you shipped was a mistake. Fool me once. Advice for other Amazon faithful who buy products from the ""Other Sellers"" catagory - - DON'T."
1,Bought and returned 2 of them,1st one returned because radio did not work and 1 tape deck only played monaural instead of stereo/2nd one returned because record turntable did not work.Will not buy another one.
3,"Not Bad, but not Great","Though I would not say that the GPX is the best compact system I ever had, I will say that it does it's job. The turntable works, the 3 disc player works, I would imagine that the cassette deck works but the radio is where the main problem lies. It only seems to want to pick up 1 or 2 stations with the strongest signal and ignore the other stations in the market. Other than that, what do you expect for the price?"
1,Do not purchase this item for the turntable....,I purchased this item online from Target before I read any of the customer reviews. I wish I had. The turntable was the reason for this purchase and it is terrible. I have to turn it on and let the turntable spin awhile so that it will slow down enough so that the records wont sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks. And the little teeny sound you get from the turntable is enough to make you cry. There is some good to this product. The cd and cassette sounds are great!!! For the price I kinda realized that I was taking a chance on this purchase. Do not purchase this product if you are looking for a strong turntable with great sound!!!You will be sorely disappointed as I was.
1,Don't bother,"Garbage! Don't waste your time with this, buy a stand alone turntable and either a CD/Cassette/Radio audio system with av inputs or stand alone receivers and speakers. It may cost more, but it'll likely save you the headaches."
5,Works Fine,"This is a very handy gadget for me because I can monitor the temps in my fridge in different places to see where the colder and hotter spots are. It is just the right size so as not to take up too much space, and the dial is easily readable. Build quality is good, no complaints. As for accuracy, I compared it against a different brand right next to each other and the readings are similar so I will have to assume it is accurate. I'm not using it for critical applications anyway, just making sure the fridge is cold enough for safe food storage. I would buy this again."
1,"Not accurate, display rotates, no customer service","After wondering why it showed a few degrees under 32F in our fridge but nothing froze, I put a second digital thermometer in there and discovered it was reading about 8F too low. Now I can see that the background of the dial showing the readings is loose and rotates freely.The company has no phone number and didn't respond to my email. It says Miu France but appears to be made by a Chinese company, Xinhua Corporation.Fortunately amazon customer service is great and issued a prompt refund."
2,Low production quality,"While there are some very talented singers on this DVD, if you're accustomed to watching the Gaither DVDs you may be disappointed with the quality of the production. The concert is in a church, and it looks like what you'd expect from a local church film of a concert. The attempt at being a professional production is rather lame. You're watching Russ Taft sing on stage and all of a sudden a grainy film of him from 10-15 years ago singing the same song is spliced into the number. Fortunately, I can get a refund."
3,Great product but ultra fragile!,"The details on this product are very well crafted, however, the product is extremely fragile. My son received this as a Christmas present, and before the day was through, Wolverine had two claws left!!! The funny thing is that while I was telling my son that he'd should be careful with the product and was showing him what he can and what he can't do with it, one of the claws came off in a very light interaction. Oops! Still the three stars are for the craftsmanship, a piece of art - but not a toy :("
4,Top notch book for identifying every Corvette & specs,"I found this book to be everything I expected it to be. A picture of every year, along with manufacturing info, options, brief history and much more....my only reason for a non-five star rating is because of no color pages! Corvettes deserve more than black & white!!!"
4,Great descriptive account of the scene,"I'm confused about reviews that claim it's ""not about the grundge scene (sic)"" because the book is not supposed to be ABOUT grunge. However, the book does cover many to most of the local bands during the early 90s and of course references the ones that ""made it,"" although you'll do better elsewhere for material on Nirvana, Mudhoney, etc. But the book is chock full of material on a huge number of bands--perhaps too many, because some of them fly by pretty quickly. Not much cultural analysis, but plenty of little insights about individuals, venues, etc. The book is strongest post-1975, especially post-1985."
5,Dive into the mosh-pit of the Seattle Scene!,"Loser is THE definitive book of the Seattle music scene. It provides a historical perspective of the Seattle rock music legacy and chronicles the ""grunge"" scene with great photographs and poster art. If you ever wondered about the evolution of Pearl Jam, Nirvana, or Soundgarden, you must buy this book"
1,a bit disapointing...,"I admit, I bought this book for the art & posters. in that regard it is a bit disapointing: the art is all printed in the margins in black and white. The reproductions look like xerox copies -- granted, that is how a lot of the orignal art looked and how it was originally reproduced, but the pictures are so small and grainy, you need a lot of imagination to enjoy them. I was very bummed. Especially since I was looking specifically for art & posters by Art Chantry. If that is what you are looking for, this aint it."
2,An okay book but NOT about the Grundge scene.,"This book is okay if you want to learn about Seattle history. Me? I couldn't care less, I wanted to learn about the bands that came out of Seattle in the 90's not about who founded the town of Seattle!!"
1,This Sucks,Very simply. Do not waste your money on this movie. It is filled with the worst acting that you'll ever experience.The whole thing is almost painful to watch. Remember it's 90 minutes you'll never get back.
5,Great Recording of a Great Opera,"When I first purchased this album, I was somewhat inexperienced with opera. Comparing this to others that I had heard, I found that L'Incoronazione di Poppea, or especially this recording of it, sounded different somehow, even strange, with all the high vocal ranges and the lack of extensive background instrumentation. However, I have now fully overcome my original doubt and now rank this as one of my favorite opera recordings. It is exactly what L'Incoronazione should be - somewhat simple, liquid, aurally pleasing rather than overwhelming. But, at the same time it should not be mixed up with light-hearted pretty music, it was Monteverdi's true magnum opus and one of the great highlights of early opera. I'm confidant that if you are willing to familiarize with this work as exactly what it is - an early Venetian opera - and nothing else, you will soon find yourself addicted. It is overwhelmingly worth the few days wait for shipping."
3,Outdated photo examples,"While the basic theory will probably continue to exist for years to come, the photo examples of aircraft and electronic circuitry within the textbook are clearly way out-dated. If author is no longer alive, I suggest someone attempt to update this textbook who enjoys the original author's writing style."
4,Great Introductory Book for New Radar Systems Engrs Like Me,"This book is a great reference for any radar related questions. I felt it was organized fairly well and especially geared for novices in the field like me. The illustrations aided me in understanding some of the tougher concepts and I especially enjoyed the historical sidebar descriptions that spanned the history of radar-equipped airplanes. For the next edition, I hope the authors expand their appendices to include more expansive summary set of equations and concepts as even a quicker reference."
1,Not what I needed.,"If you are looking for a book to explain interpretation of airborne weather, this book is not for you. If you are looking for technical engineering information, you probably will like it."
5,The true meaning of Ultimate Bodybuilding Training Intensity,"Dorian Yates is the living & breathing example of true Bodybuilding Training & Intensity. Very few people ever experience such will-power to the point of self-destruction. I can identify with his training intensity as I have lifted weights & semi-pro 'body-built' for the last 20 years. Dorian is such an inspiration to me & his book is THE ultimate in bodybuilding training. Arnold would talk trash but Dorian would let his body do the talking on stage!!! I love it! I saw Dorian guest pose a few years back in Chicago at the Jr USA, I have never seen such an impressive physique. I have never seen such a HUGE, AWESOME bodybuilder in my life! And probably never will again. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning what REAL bodybuilding is. If you can find one of his books available that is. P.S. Buy Dorian's video - You will freak out!!!-MARK RENTAS"
5,A Shadow Dynamite,"When I read Dorian Yates Blood & Guts book, believe me the first thing I did immediately was sending my previous book(Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding, Arnold Schwarzenegger) into my dustbin. Arnold has always talked rubbish, given fake advice, misguided many youngsters whether it comes to training, diet.Trust me, if you are really serious about bodybuilding, this book is for you. The language is very simple. The advice is straightforward. I began to feel results immediately after 4-6 weeks of intense training. My recuperation is far better now.Guess what, I'm going to give a try to the Dorian Yates Approved supplements(Pro Peptide & Pro MR) and soon going to post a second review!"
5,A great gift for new parents,"As a pediatrician, I love this little book and have given it to all my friends when they had their first baby. Dr. Stern is a recognized expert on early childhood development and teaches at Cornell. In this book he has done something quite unusual. He succeeded in weaving the pearls from his academic work into a delightful, readable book that any interested person can enjoy. This book makes it fun to understand your child better."
5,every new parent should read this,This is an amazing book. It tells the story of what life is like from birth to age 4 from the point of view of the child. I give it as a gift to every new parent I know because I believe that the most important quality in a parent is empathy -- the capacity to understand the inner experience of their child. It is written by a highly respected researcher on child development and is also useful for graduate students in psychology to get a handle on difficult concepts in a pleasurable way.
4,A best guess of how it all works,"An engaging read about how a doctor thinks a baby comprehends things. The parents call the little one 'Pumpkin'. Mentions things that done repeatedly help the child learn, such as the sound of the parent's car pulling into the drive let's the child know daddy is home. Mentions the child's comprehension of movement as its eyes follow light dancing along the wall.Ultimately it is difficult to know the particulars but this gives a thinking person cause to consider their child's future."
2,a little too verbal for a baby,This author pretends that he is speaking as the baby and its ridiculous. He is a baby with a HUGE extensive vocabulary and is also very poetic. At times these baby narrations just become too silly to even take this book seriously.
5,Surprisingly good--I learned from it,"I got this book free at the EDS booth at the Windows 2000 launch in San Francisco. I didn't expect it to be this good. It's described as entry-level to Active Directory, but there is a lot of good technical stuff. I recommend it."
2,Reads like a collection of MS articles,"I needed a high level presentation of AD and thought this was the right book for me. Unfortunately, it does not read like a book but rather like a collection of articles with no connection other than being grouped by topic. I think it would have been much easier to convey the concepts with an example that would have been used throughout the book to illustrate the kind of needs that AD would address for company ACME and how the latter would go about implementing and deploying AD.I give it 2 stars because I am sure it will be useful as a reference book once I get a better grasp of the AD concepts through other sources."
4,Active Directory for Dummies,"I like this book, very easy to follow and great tool for beginers like me!!! I found the first two chapters a bit slow but as you progress it gets more complex but still easy to understand!"
4,Simple explanation,"You have no need to worry all the unknown terms, alien language, confusing words that you might have found in the other books. Here, you will get simple explanations about every term used around Active Directory. It's a good one.. I like it =)"
1,A dud,No effect whatsoever. I believe the amounts of actual beneficial ingredients is negligible. World renowned expert Ray Sahelian is basically an Internet hack getting rich off suckers... like me.
1,Not Original Artist,Sample songs would have told me that this was not the original artist. Wasted my time and energy!
3,This is the BCC and Double D...,"Boot Camp Clik have some of the most underappreciated mc's in the game and on their own have brought out some classic albums, but they just don't make that classic BCC sound when they are all together."
5,"Welcome to Bucktown, USA","The word that describes this album best is ""Whoa."" Dope beats, great lyricism from all the B. C. C. ""The Chosen Few"" is one of my favorite albums of 2002. Suggested tracks to check out are: All of 'em. This album is definately not for those that think clowns like Ja Rule or Nelly represent true hip hop. This album is real hip hop for real hip hop headz."
3,Where's Rock???,"He is definetly missed here. The beats are much better than what I've heard recently from BCC, especially Hi-tek who could make Nelly sound dope. However the lyrics which I was hoping would improve still suffer, especially Louisville who I know a lot of people don't feel, but I thought he tore it up on Da Storm and on warzone. Definetly an improvement but I don't think they can come close to another Nocturnal or Da storm. And does anyone know where Rock is? Does he have a solo album coming out or something?? He left BCC I assume?"
2,"goodbye BCC, it's been nice","This isn't the BCC I Remember. This is some poppy, played out, might as well be fabolous, Jay Z or any other pop rap group out there. With the exception of Smif n Wesson you have 5 rappers who sound exactly the same as one another with mostly lame beats that could have been made for Nsync's crossover rap album. 1 or 2 good tracks, the rest is fluff. The BCC I remember was totally underground, hip hop to the core, rough and rugged with hardcore beats. This ain't it."
3,Worst of the three,"There are a total of three Wayne Gorbea CDs available on Amazon.com. This is the worst. None of the tunes on this CD got me excited. On the other hand, I can dance to it.The other two CDs are great. They make me sing as well as dance. My neighbors don't like it."
4,Great Value,"I bought this LCD monitor for my adult son, to replace a CRT. He is very happy with the performance of the display, resolution, color, etc. A friend took a look at it and quickly bought one for himself because the performance/price is a great value. We can't comment yet on longevity, since we're only a few months into its service life. But so far, so good. If there are no issues a year from now, my 4 stars would go to 5."
5,Just what I hoped for...,"Great picture, very easy to set up, packaged well to protect product. I am very glad to have bought this."
2,Can't get it working with new laptop,"I have spent days tryng to get this working with my new laptop, and have had brush off from Acer.CDROM has feeble 'manual' but no driver, so you have to download it.So far I have a stretched 1024 by 768 picture, not a 1440 x 900 one.After Googling, I can see a lot of other people have the same problem.If you aren't absolutely sure it will work with your laptop - don't get it!"
1,Unbelieveably Bad Color Reproduction,"Don't try and save money with this thing. Text is blurry, even with lots of fiddling color reproduction is horrid. Just a really bad monitor, worst I've used and I plug into a big monitor every where I travel with my laptop."
1,Bitten by the Lemon Bug ?!?,"Thought this would be a great upgrade over my old MAG CRT, but it failed after about 1-1/2 hours ... all seemed fine after initial hook-up, but by the 2nd hour, got a flicker and went black. Never came back to a readable screen after that. I sent it back to Amazon for a refund, and was happy with that process ... will try something else in the future."
3,Ya get what you pay for,"For $200, I guess it's pretty okay. It's bright and big, which is really all I thought I wanted. It isn't quite as sharp as I'd hoped, and no matter how hard I try I can't get the colors to match my MacBook display. I'm pretty picky though.But here's the real problem: Right out of the box, my monitor has a dead pixel. It isn't even off in the corner; it's right smack dab in the middle of the screen. The Acer website is pretty easy to navigate and I got a warentee ticket submitted right away, but now I have to send the monitor to Texas to get it fixed. Lame. Still, I can't say I wouldn't recommend this monitor to a friend who couldn't afford something a little bit nicer."
4,Pretty good but NO DVI,"This is a pretty good monitor, haven't noticed any backlighting issues and there were no dead pixels in the two I bought. Resolution is nice and the 5ms refresh rate means you can use it for games without any problem.The only problem I found is that this monitor doesn't have a DVI input. Although the description doesn't mention the monitor having one (which would have changed my rating to zero since it would have been a lie), its not something you look carefully at, as one would expect a 19W monitor to have a DVI input by default.You can buy an adapter for that, but it just feels like a blemish on an otherwise excellent product."
4,Nice Monitor,This monitor is great for the price. I would have given 5 stars if the instructions had been a little better. I was able to figure it out... but a good set of instructions would have been easier.
5,Double-9 Dominoes,I like the black dot double-9 dominoes. I am unsure how long the vinyl case will last. I can forsee problems with the zipper. I would have preferred a metal case.
1,"Buyer Beware, Inaccurate description!!!!","This is marketed as a ""by HP"", it is not an HP adapter as the description in title states: ""HP ED494AA 65 Watt Smart AC Adapter by HP"" That is supposed to mean IT IS manufactured by HP. It is NOT!!! These are generic knockoff adapters. These are misrepresented. I returned the product, and the reason for the seller(E-LIVE or Long) stated for the refund was listed as ""Item shipped late"", not for the real reasons of false description. Recommend that you do NOT purchase this product from E-LIVE.HP ED494AA 65 Watt Smart AC AdapterThey further list the HP Part number in the product Technical description:Brand Name: HPModel: ED494AA#ABABuyers should not be allowed to be misled by sellers retailing under completely inaccurate descriptions."
5,Just what you would expect,Great price. Came in just as expected and performs very well. It all you could hope for from an AC adapter.
1,Broke after 2 DAYS,Out of the package it was exactly like the old charger (which was about 6 years old at the time it broke). This charger worked for 2 DAYS! That's it... 2 DAYS. Useless. Do not buy.
1,Do not buy!,I plugged it in for only an hour with my laptop and it burned out. I recommend that you do NOT buy this product.
2,Dissapointing,"I got this charger just over two months ago and I'm already trying to figure out how much longer I can use it before irreparably damaging my computer. As soon as I got it I began to suspect it was not very high quality, just by the feel of it. Unfortunately, I was right. In weeks, the plastic covering began to separate from where it connected to the plug and just a short while later the wires under their second coating of plastic became exposed, shocking me when I tried to pull it out of the socket. Further, although technology experts at my school assured me this was the same type as what I had before after reading the description posted online, it is definitely not the same strength and I watched my battery which used to last well over 1.5 hours get to the point where it would hardly last me 40 minutes--not something I wanted for my computer-heavy classes. I would recommend paying the extra money and getting a quality product."
1,garbage,I bought adapter in December and it has failed already. After a month it started acting erratically and sometimes it would charge my laptop and sometimes it would not. I had to hold it at a certain angle for it to charge. Last week after tow months of use it stopped working - it died. The quality of the adapter is poor. When it was new the pieces did not fit together as snug as they should and that is a big no no when it comes to electrical stuff. Based on other comments I am not alone in feeling this product is a piece of garbage. I won't buy another HP product again.
1,unreliable,"Much like some of the other people mentioned, the AC adapter that came with the notebook became unusable after just a few months. You had to hold it in to get it to charge, and eventually the wires became exposed making it hazardous. We bought the replacement adapter and that worked fine for just over a month, but then the same problems started happening again. Of course it's past the 30 day mark so it's too late to return it now. I would recommend looking for a universal power adapter with a sturdy hard plastic tip instead of this one. It may cost more in the short term, but it's cheaper than buying a new AC adapter every 2 months."
2,Not that smart adapter,"This adapter breaks easily. I had to get a replacement after using it for about 3 days. Amazon was very helpful and guick to replace it. However, I ended up returning the replacement after about a week. The small adapter wears out easily and connection is not secure. Don't need to spend extra for this adapter."
1,I've just waste my money,"This items was terrible, first I don't know why it has an adapter on the end of the cable, second the adaptor at the end of the cable doesn't fit completely, and just to make my day better the good damn ADAPTOR at the end of the cable works for just a week... By the way HP's website help is terrible it's almost worst than the ADAPTOR at the end of the cable. People buy MAC!."
2,It wasn't the right size.,"Yeah, I wasted my money here. It was supposed to fit my HP Pavilion dv8000, but it didn't. So it became another unnecessary wire in my electronics basket. Real shame."
1,does not work,"Adapter does not work at all and the connector that goes to the laptop is loose. Also, capacity of adaptor is lower than that ordered."
1,WASTE OF TIME - STOPPED WORKING,Worked fine for a week then stopped working entirely. Tried multiple outlets and multiple compatible computers. Skip this and spend a few extra bucks on a more reliable brand.
1,definitely not worth buying,"This worked for about a week, but got got EXTREMELY hot when charging with the laptop on (less so with laptop shut down). It stopped working altogether after only about a week. Definitely not worth the money. I ended up buying an official (expensive) HP brand charger. Better safe than sorry (in terms of the extreme heat) and, in the long run, a better value."
1,These are much too small and not a bit helpful,"These cards are the size of a business card - each one has three words on it such as ""ball"", ""bat"", ""bicycle"" or ""elephant"", ""farm"", ""fish"", with the translation on the back. There are a few with very short sentences. It would be much better to make your own on a 3 x 5 or 4 x 6 index card. No way are these worth $10. If you look at the other reviews almost every reviewer has only reviewed the various Ace exambusters cards. I have wonderful flash cards in Spanish that taught me so much from Warren Hardy - I was hoping these would be similar for Italian but they are useless. There are many better materials for teaching yourself Italian available on Amazon such as the Practice Makes Perfect series of workbooks and the Pimsleur Italian cds."
5,A GREAT EXPERIENCE,"this is a breath of fresh air!,a real rock and roll record,this is what is needed,no turntables, no rap nonsense, this is by far better than the self titled release of a few years ago, steve blaze is an amazing songwriter,rock and roll will never die, this record proves that!"
3,Dirk Bogarde is not in this Film,"Dirk Bogarde acted as Dr. Simon Sparrow in 'Doctor in the House', 'Doctor at Sea', 'Doctor at Large' and 'Doctor in Distress'. He was replaced in 'Doctor in Love' by Michael Craig and in 'Doctor in Clover' and 'Doctor in Trouble' by Leslie Phillips. He also had a cameo as Simon Sparrow in 'They Joined the Navy'."
1,canceld,never recieved item. was very disappointed couldn't get item afer 1 month of ordering. found it elsewhere & recieved within 1 week
2,Go Back to The Original,"Boy was this disappointing. Like most fans of this period I looked forward to this new version. Bah humbug. Ray Winstone seemed to be auditioning for a gangster movie and there were too many inaccuracies.The original Six Wives series (a very early Masterpiece Theatre production, I think) with Keith Michell is much better.For historical accuracy the Starkey version is very interesting and gives a better view of both the characters and their time."
1,Disappointing,"I feel somewhat disgusted that I lent two evenings of my life to watching this terrible film. Although it appeared on PBS's Masterpiece Theater, I wouldn't call this a masterpiece by anyone's definintion.I am a history buff, but not a historian, and yet I spent most of this movie picking it apart as it was inaccurate on too many things to list.I could have probably overlooked the inaccuracies if it had at least been well acted or interesting, but it was neither. The acting was mediocre, Ray Winstone seemed to be channeling Tony Soprano for his bizarre portrayal of Henry the VIII. Helena Bonham Carter phoned in her performance of Anne Boleyn.I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend instead that you get Starkey's closer to historically accurate and far more interesting ""Six Wives of Henry the VIII""."
2,so so and very historically inaccurate,"I was really looking forward to this since I loved the Six Wives one with Keith Michell. Unfortunately, it just left me cold. Very beautiful, lavish sets and Helena Bonham Carter made a wonderful Anne Boleyn. But too many flaws historically left me sad and wanting."
3,Wrong product order,"I didn't read carefully and ordered a product that won't work on US DVD players, so I was forced to return it. Not the seller's fault. I should have read the fine print."
1,A ghastly mistake,"I have little to add to the other reviewers, who categorize this production's inadequacies most effectively. I merely want to emphasize the abysmal casting and mis-casting; take one example -- Emilia Fox was fine in ""The Pianist."" She just doesn't belong here. And as for Winstone? Well, Henry VIII had his vulgar side but he was profoundly concerned with the stature and dignity of his office and was not inclined to let his guard down in public. He was every inch a king, not every inch the bouncer down the pub.Fortunately, relief is at hand in the form of the 1969 BBC 6-parter which towers over this travesty and manages to get pretty much all of the details right. That legendary production is a miracle of fine writing, careful thought, superb acting, and judicious casting (Bernard Hepton was born to play Cranmer, and don't forget Basil Dignam as the awful Gardiner). It's as fresh and vivid as the day it was released!"
2,Henry Soprano,"Ray Winstone is very good in the recent King Arthur film, where playing a side-thug to history is fine. But in the title role of this film, his all-to-20th Century thug acting left something to be desired. In fact, the producers admitted to the very flaw of this film as their intention, to make Henry VIII a modern day gangster. Tony Soprano as King of England.Part two, which features Henry in his later years, is much better than part one, but all in all, I still felt this was far too modern an approach to history.My main gripe about this was its lack of historical ""feel"" and ""style"". This was a conscious decision and not one I agree with. If you want a ""Henry the VIII for the new Millennium"" ... well, this might be it."
5,worth the wait,"there had been an issue getting this album to various distribution channels, which meant that i waited from mid november until mid january. the album got here about a week ago. everything on this record was written, scored, arranged, recorded and produced by noah georgeson. the guitar, vocals, piano, organ and mellotron are also all noah. the orchestral accompaniment is performed by the kite hill chamber orchestra, and you guessed it... conducted by noah.you get a sense, as a listener, that noah georgeson knows his music, and knows it well. the pieces are all there, the roots are solidly planted, and this album was undoubtedly worth the wait."
5,SMOKIN!!!,"This CD is a wonderful example, of ""balls to the walls"" sax playin! The compositions are hooky and memorable. The music takes you somewhere, each track has something to say, unlike other ""laa-dee-daa"" instrumental CD's. Toms melodies get under your skin, and his solos flow with soulful/rockin unpredictability. I LOVE this CD, and highly recommend it! ***** FIVE STARS!"
1,Not worth the price,"Half of this DVD is tame footage in faded COLOR, including a stripper holding up a baloon named SPOUTNIK and a woman in close-fitting knee-length pants... 1930s?? Who are they trying to fool?"
1,Doesn't fit,"Before buying these I checked the tool if it can fit on my 2006 GX 470 and it says it will fit. Now when I have it and tried it on, the nuts are entirely different than the real ones and it won't fit at all."
1,Nuts!,"I bought these for my 2004 Lexus RX330 because I didn't want to use the special key that Lexus provides. I installed them myself, but when my mechanic rotated my tires, he said they were the wrong kind for that car. Something about how the nut has a beveled edge, but real Lexus nuts have a flat edge where they make contact. He got me real ones from the dealer. Check your nut style before buying these. My fault for buying them."
4,Finally!,"After disappointing synthesized scores, Badelt returns to score another orchestral score in epic fashion. Yes, there is a lot of ""media venture"" percussion work, but that aside, the music is wonderfully romantic, tragic, and powerful. Some in the film score world regard this as Bedelt's best score since THE TIME MACHINE. I can agree with that but THE TIME MACHINE remains his best score.""The Robe,"" ""Love Theme,"" ""Kunlun the Slave,"" ""Snow Country,"" ""Guilang the Assassin,"" and ""Wuhuan's Plan"" are some of the better tracks on the lengthy album.This one deserves to be in your soundtrack library!"
2,Caution! This is NOT the Myriad that has gotten air time on Christian radio this year!,"I guess I should have done my homework better, but I fell in love with the Myriad (the CCM group) this summer and just went looking for any older stuff from them. I bought this CD thinking it was them. So this review may not be fair to this group, because honestly, I listened to 2 songs on it and ejected it because it wasn't who I thought it was, so give it a listen and judge for yourself. But if you're looking for the Christian band - The Myriad - keep searching, this is not it."
5,HAD ME IN DA ZONE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ENJOYED THIS CD TOTALLY, I WAS LISTENING WHILE I WAS CLEANING,AND DA TIME JUST SLIP AWAY,I WAS IN A ZONE MAN, IT MADE A LONG TEDIOUS TASK, THAT MUCH MORE BEARABLE!!!! I LOVED DA TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE,IT WAS A VERYENJOYABLE ONE!!!!"
2,Where was the proofreading?,"The story is okay, though not as good as the first two. I had a hard time enjoying it, though, because of all the grammatical errors (spelling, capitalization, punctuation). When I purchase an ebook from Amazon, I expect it to be a final edited copy, not an unedited unproofed one. Shame, Amazon. You owe refunds."
4,A Sharon Kay Penman Fan,"I have read almost every book Sharon Kay Penman has written, but I would say this was not one of her best. Ordered simply because I had read just about everything she wrote other than her ""mystery"" novels."
3,Highly detailed story...,"The intrigues of the royal court and Crusades intermingle with daily life when one of the ransom payments Queen Eleanor sends to try and rescue Richard the Lionheart disappears in Wales. To find out how and why, Justin De Quincy (from the Queen's Man) is sent, but finds himself in the midst of a greater mystery, murder.*** In this highly detailed story, Ms. Penman brings the middle ages to life. The lyrical Welsh speech has a beauty that almost makes one forget the graver matters. Historical notes weave easily into the plotline, educating the reader unobtrusively. Justin reveals keen insight into the world around him, and minor subplots create a greater depth to the master story. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore"
1,What is Penguin thinking?,"It boggles the mind that Penguin thinks it can charge $19 for a book that sells in dead tree form for $11.I love Penman's more serious books, but the de Quincy novels are really only light reading and should not cost more than a mass market paperback."
4,"Good job, de Quincy!","Short but sweet!A nice little mystery that will lead you into the books that follow!Sharon Kay Penman is flawless, as usual :)"
4,Penman's take on Wales 12th & 13th centuries,I always enjoy Penman's historic based novels because she is so thorough in her research of history and always mentions when she has veered from the facts. This is an interesting story about one of Queen Eleanor's men- (Eleanor of Aquitaine)
4,More Penman,"Just more Penman, she could add more specifics, to her historical fiction, instead she just sets her characters in the times. For example, she could describe what they eat, how it was prepared etc..."
4,A worthwhile sequel,"I am very impressed by all of Ms. Penmans' books that I have read. The sheer amount of historical research that goes into them is mind boggling. Dragon's Lair is the third installment in her mystery series. I think my favorite is still The Queen's Man; however, Dragon's Lair is a worthy contender.Justin de Quincy is yet again sent off on a mission on behalf of the legendary Eleanor of Aquitaine who is the ruling monarch of the English, Aquitaine and Normandy empires while her son Richard the Lionheart is in an Austrian dungeon due to being captured on his way home from the Crusades.Part of the ransom has gone missing in the deep forests of Wales. Eleanor sends Justin to investigate and return the ransome if at all possible.In typical Penman mystery fashion there are a number of twists and turns so it's not easy to guess what is on the next page.I highly recommend it for people who like mysteries or books based upon the early ages of the English empire."
5,Magnificent Medieval Mystery!,"Sharon Penman has done it again! This is the third in her series of Medieval Mysteries starring Justin de Quincy. Justin is Queen Eleanor's man and is investigating and trying to recover the stolen ransom, in Wales, meant for King Richard, The Lionheart's, release from an Austrian prison. The story is fast paced with surprises around every corner.Prince John is a deliciously wicked as he constantly schemes to thwart his mother's attempts to free his brother and place himself on the throne. Justin encounters many difficult situations but like a cat always seems to land on his feet.I believe this is the best yet of Sharon's mysteries and I could not stop turning the pages! I read it in a little less than three days but not because it was a short novel, 322 pgs., but because it was such an exciting, engrossing read. It is full of detail and description, especially about Wales and Chester. Incredibly captivating!"
2,It so obvious who the culprit is.,"While this book may be historically accurate, to me anyway, it amounted to a huge disappointment because I was looking forward to a very good read. There are a number of different suspects and you`ll figure out who two of them are right from the beginning. Unlike other idiots on this site who INSIST on putting spoilers in their reviews you`ll just have to trust me when I say one individual is accused from the start and another reveals themselves to Justin straight away. After that the story sort of lumbers along until the plain and simple is spoken and at this point I could care less if they found the ransom or not. I might have injoyed the story more if it went back and forth between Justin`s search and before and up until Richard was kidnapped for the King does not make an appearence in the story.P.S. For whatever it`s worth how does anybody read 2 books a day EVERYDAY for over 8 years and not dislike anyone of said books?"
4,i think it is a nice movie,"it is a nice movie in spite of the fact that i was not certain how i felt about it. i am happy i watched it, to be sure, but it was more soft and emotional than i expected. yes it was quite good and you should watch it."
2,"De los Angeles is lovable, but the rest . . . uh oh","This 1960 EMI recording finds the wonderful de los Angeles as appealing as ever, but she didn't have the colorature for Violetta, only the pathos and vulnerability. Serafin was old and tired by this time, and his conducting is lackluster and often slack. The thankfully forgotten tenor, Carlo del Monte, blares away in mindless fashion half the time, and the elder Germont, Mario Sereni, is as faceless and dull as he was in Callas's legendary Lisbon Traviata.I'm giving it straight not to criticize those reviewers who clearly love this set and ignore its flaws, but to let newcomers know what they have in store. I love de los Angeles as much as anyone, but a diamond can fall in the mud."
5,"Captivating for infant, Love it!","From just a couple of weeks old, we used this toy to distract her if she was having a meltdown (of course she couldn't hold it then) and she still loves this toy! Now she can throw it around and squish the flowers. The lights and music did a great job calming my baby and still does! Well worth the money."
3,OK- won't last,"My 6 month old daughter got this for Christmas. She did enjoy pushing the flowers and looking at the lights, but seemed like a bit of a waste to me. And within a year of occasional GENTLE use, the thing broke. Definitely WOULD NOT buy again. There are so many better toys out there at this price... do yourself a favor and get something else."
2,Not worth it,"My 9 month old daughter is bored with this already. Little hands have a hard time tilting the flowers to make the music come on. And when the music does play, it's too loud, with no control over the volume. The base isn't sturdy enough, so it's easily tipped over & tossed around. There are so many other great toys out there for the [...] I spent on this, so I recommend you find something different."
5,Great toy!,My daughter loved touching a feeling this toy and listening to the cheerful music even before she could sit up. Now my son looks for it and loves touching the flowers to see them light up and play for him. There are several settings for different levels of interaction - I bought this from Target $19.99- well worth the money and very durable!
5,Wonderful Toy,I just received this toy for my 9 month old daughter. It is one of the most adorable toys I have ever seen! The chime songs are very cute and not annoying like a lot of toys. She loves to smack the tops of the flowers to make them light up and chime. The toy also helps with dexterity since she spends a lot of time spinning the flowers around using the various materials attached to them for petals. All of the crunchy noises are bonus too! :) I highly recommend!
2,lamaze chime garden,"My son loves this toy, so I was purchasing it as a replacement for the one we have. Within the first week it quit working and it sounded like the wires were crossed or something. Music is mixed up and jumps from song to song. I attempted to contact manufacturer and received no response."
5,lamaze chime garden,"I gave this to my granddaughter for christmas. She is too young to tell me if she likes it, but I thought it was a cute toy for her."
3,"Nice twinkly music, not a lot of substance.","Cute, but hasn't been played with much. My one year old received this for Christmas, and while it plays nice music, it's been mostly ignored. I think it would be better for a younger child."
1,Couldn't get past graphic degeneracy,"Terrible read. Started out with very interesting story and intriguing character but I quit one quarter the way through because I didn't enjoy the increasingly pornographic details. I tried to skim over the too descriptive bits but eventually felt assaulted and quit. The story seemed to be stuck in the degeneracy of the ""swinging 60's"" in London."
5,Camelia,"A great read!Make sure you read ""Ellie"" before you read this one or it will be a little tricky to follow.I love Lesley Pearse and the way she gets you so invlived with her characters!Enjoy the read people!!"
5,Wonderful read!,"I found this novel a wonderful read as I do with all of Lesley Pearse's books. Camellia was rivetting and very hard to put down. What an intriguing character from Lesley, once again."
