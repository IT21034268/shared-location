4,A different approach to a counting book.,"Poor little monkey. Lives on an island with a fox and a snail. The only thing to eat are lemons. Boiled, fried, steamed, sauteed, pureed, and dried. A dismal existence for sure. But wait there is a banana tree on the island across the Sillabobble Sea. The only thing in the way is a sea of full of crocodiles. What to do? One promises to carry the monkey across if she counts them. Can the Croc be trusted?This is a nice little book with decent artwork. It has a nice rhythm to the story and it counts from one to ten but it also counts down from ten as the monkey goes back home.It's not too scary for little ones. The crocs don't try to bite and they are put it silly situations for the counting part.The age range given is 3-7 but I think you could probably reduce it to 3-5. Especially, if your child is good with numbers.Overall not bad for somebody learning to count but for the 6-7 year old; it could be a rarely read book."
2,"A cute book, with a poor message, and frightening crocodiles","At first glance, I liked this book, but my 2.5 yr old son did not like it at all. When I asked him why, he pointed to a drawing of the crocodiles, and said ""sharp teeth."" A similar book that he prefered is ""One Monkey Too Many."" I found the rhymes somewhat forced. The message is one greedy monkey can outwit many crocodiles to help get what he wants -- not exactly a good role model for a young child. One page of crocodiles with chicken pox only reminded my son of the shot the doctor gave him to avoid the pox. In the end, the monkey does not deliver what he promised to the crocodiles -- how many crocodiles are there in the sea?"
3,on a mission to get answers,"A funny touching kid's film that will probably be over the heads of most people.Why be good to the bully or the fat kid who is kind of a pest?What happens to people when they die?That first time a girl is more than a mean kid in a dresshappens without warning.Faith isn't taught by ""goose bumps"", butby getting in touch and being wide awake.Most of us don't ever have a mission,and certainly not in the 5th grade.Heart warming is good, but answers about Godare really from inside and not from a movie."
5,Great little known film!,"When I first saw this in the video store I worked in, I decided that I'd watch it because I like whatever Rosie O'Donnell is in. I'm certainly happy that I did! Rosie really didn't impress me on her own, it was Joseph Cross, the little boy who is searching for God to make sure that his grandfather is OK in heaven. He did a great job for such a young actor.This immediately went on my recommendation list for customers and I still recommend it for everyone 10 and over."
2,Issues....,"Someone please explain to me the issues that M Night Shamaylan has with the Christian Church. I am FAR from being a religious fanatic, but I have noticed that in at least three of his films, he has tried to attack the strength the Christian Church (Signs -Mel Gibson, a priest who leaves the Church because he is disillusioned after his wife dies; Unbreakable - the Catholic Priest has no answers for Bruce Willis who comes for counselling, and Wide Awake another disillusioned Christian child). This is particularly offensive seeing that he is a non-Christian."
4,One to look for!,"You won't find this movie in a prominant place at your local video store. you will have to really LOOK for it. But when you find it,rent it. This movie is enchanting, funny, moving and somehow profound. This is from the guy who wrote and directed THE SIXTH SENSE and WIDE AWAKE has a few things in common with SENSE: it deals with grief in real emotional terms, it has an INCREDIBLE performance by a young actor (Joseph Cross)and a neat little ""surpirse"" at the end.Seek this one out and share it with the kids. It is funny and moving!"
5,Simply one of the best movies ever made.,"Simply put, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. There are a few slow parts in the movie which could have easily been eliminated, but the content was overwhelming and the story compelling.It's a story of a boy's awakening to his spirtual side and his quest to find meaning in a confusing world. He faces mockery from some and kindness from unexpected sources and, in the end, finds himself 'wide awake' for the first time.So is this a story of a spiritual seeking or simply a metaphor for the journey we all take as we come of age? The beauty of this movie is you don't need to choose. You get two stories for the price of one.Not only did I find myself thinking about this movie several days later, this is also one of the few movies which actually made me cry out loud and I'm impressed by any movie which can move me to this extent."
3,Beautiful but broken!,"This is lovely china. Caution though as Amazon does little to protect the china during shipping.I just returned my second set that was broken. The only protection was a plastic bag filled with air.PLEASE! put more packing into more delicate Items.Great price, shipping free, but at what cost? To turn around and send back?I'm only giving three stars for shipping problems.China 5 out 5 Stars!"
2,Lot's of Breakage,This was a wedding gift for our daughter but after several tries to send it (they always broke) she took a credit and ordered something else. The pattern has been discontinued by Mikasa.
1,horrible,"this book was such a dissapointment, I really expected it to be sooo much better. First the story dragged on,the characters were absolutely dull. it was just so unrealistic, i mean how can a guy fall in love with some girl he see's a picture of in the news paper??.. come on...it got so boring and the small print killed it.. i skipped pages in hopes of finding it more exciting in the middle or so...but the story was like the soap operas you dont watch for a month and u start to watch again and its still the same story...."
4,What is Chivalry?,"A young Cabell weaves tales (annotated by authorities (?) of the era) spinning tales of some of the descendants (lineal and ""spiritual"")(and their consequences)that enrich the History of Dom Manuel of Poictesme. And outlines one of the characteristic approaches taken by the male in his inevitable pursuit of ""Domnei""."
2,Judo Girl,"well I am a judo fan so thats why I watched this , however it lacks acting and story plot. Really seems like an 8th grade movie project, I had high hopes and it let me down, Needed better fight choreography and just a story line. Watch it for the sake of supporting judo but thats all."
3,Decent indy flick,"Not a bad little independent short. The judo felt authentic and fun to watch. The camera produced beautiful footage which gave the movie the feel of having real production value. Like the title states, decent indy flick and worth the low price of admission in my opinion."
4,Great music for writers.,"I was intrigued by this soundtrack from the get-go. Not because of the tracks by Bjork, Radiohead, or Moby, but mainly from the score written by David Julyan. It was one of those scores that almost seduces the listener and it fit the film perfectly. Now, should you buy this cd? Sure. Especially if you enjoy writing stories and have to have some music to write by. This cd is perfect for any author who writes about gloomy subjects. Also, the other artists do a fine job, although Bjork's song in kind of freaky."
5,Memento Soundtrack,"This is one of the best soundtrack albums i've gotten in a long time. reminds me of the highly successfull soundtrack for the film Pi. Check out the previously unreleased Radiohead, Bjork and Oakenfold tracks!! A+"
3,"Mom rates it 2 stars, baby rates it 5","I don't know if this book will have staying power, but in our first week of owning it, my 20-month-old daughter has asked me to read it, on average, I'd say 10 times a day. The illustrations are cute but the text is annoying. Tucker is this undisciplined dog who runs through the house knocking into everyone and everything with a ""Wham"". At the end the family says he's too lovable to scold. The somewhat dubious message gets redeemed for me when my daughter first points at the last picture of the girl hugging the dog, with Tucker's tail wagging furiously (or ""whamming"" in this case), and laughs, ""Tail"", then points at the two of them and says with a note of pure delight in her voice, ""Happy.""If you've got a dog loving toddler, they'd probably enjoy this book. Helpful read-aloud tip: I found it much less annoying to read when I edited out every third ""Wham""."
2,Not much of a story,"My kids aren't interested in this book anymore. We read it a couple of times and that was it. The story is about a dog who knocks down just about everything in a house (the word 'wham' is used 22 times). Not much of a story, but the illustrations are very cute. This is one of those books that, as a parent, I didn't enjoy reading to my kids."
5,Nikon D70S,"This is an excellent product. It is written in simple terms that even a beginner to digital photography will understand. Despite this many advanced photographers will learn many ""wrinkles"". It avoids the use of jargon and is very well illustrated. It proves that even a photographer with almost sixty years experience can learn new tricks.Phil.Robins. (Australia)"
2,Be Forwarned!!!!,"I ordered this book and received the version that only has 10 scents. After contacting customer service they sent me another copy. I received it only to find out it was the same exact version with only 10 scents. Be forwarned when buying this book that the description and picture shown are FALSE ADVERTISING! The book itself is very cute and fun. The scents leave a little to be desired though: redhots, herbal essence shampoo, vicks vapor rub, chocolate, pine tree, musk, baseball bubble gum and a few more. If you get the version with 14 scents though it sounds like they have a few other fun smells to make it more worthwhile."
1,A Real Disapointment,I bought this book for my best friend's birthday. What a disappointment! Don't bother with this walk down Smell-ory Lane!
3,Middle of the Sentence,"There was no brand new info within that you've got certainly not go through prior to.Look Great (Easy Ways To Look Great Right Now!!!)However, she's got a nice method to this issue."
5,Looking Great and Feeling Great =),"Look Great, Feel Great is SUCH a good book. It really offers more nutritional information rather than her book ""Eat and Stay Thin"", which is good. It is a very good read - you don't have to do the 12 keys all at once and you can even skip around to what challenges you. Very informative teaching - highly recommended =D"
4,I love books!,I enjoy reading Joyce's books because I like how down to earth she is and she just hits home for me. I got a little bored with this book I suppose because there is a lot of practical advice and commonsense advice. A lot of the things I have read in numerous other books on health and my walk with God so maybe that is why it was repitious to me. There are a lot of good key points and it is a good book to reference to and take to heart and try to follow. There are some good things to copy and print and try to keep a journal and follow each day.
5,"Awesome, Just Awesome",One of the best instructional videos out today. Steve Gadd is one if not the most influential drummers in modern drum set technique today. This video has several great grooves with excellent explanations. It has been a real pleasure to watch this over and over.
3,ok instruction,"Not having any prior knowlege of steve gadd, i thought i would check out this video. im more of a lars ulrich, neil peart type drummer. everything i know i learned from them. my opinion means little, any drum instruction video has its learning potential, and this on has some. I think its a fundamental mistake to hold someone else in high regard. Steve Gadd seems to be a technical drummer as far as rudiments are concerned, he has a lifetime of experience wich you can draw from. try to learn from his mistakes and this video will serve you well. buy it if you collect drum videos its a good price."
2,Funky Illustrations but great message,"Its a great message, and decent (not great) text but I cannot get past the funky looking illustrations. The cover of the book is by FAR the best one, but the others are so unnatural looking it is almost distracting!!!"
3,A pretty good album,Not bad if you like the style of music. I really like a couple of the songs; the rest are okay.
3,Great focus!,"This book helps give a great focus on the family as the central theme of building a home-based business, which is the key motivation to this goal for most folks. Also, the Biblical references help readers reflect on the foundation and origin of enhancing our families. With so many books out there touting how to do it ""my way"", it was refreshing to see a book written on how to do it God's way. I appreciated the boldness and practicality."
1,worthless!,"I bought this book to learn about starting a small business, not to read about the bible... too bad I'm not trying to get into the bible business or this wouldn't have been such a waste of money!"
3,"Sound Effects: Sports, Laughs and Applause","I would have liked more then just ONE TRACK of a single female laugh, but at least she is young. Maybe next time a GIGGLE too? (And how about, a third track being a little girl?)"
1,Started out ok... turned to crap shrortly thereafter,"I only got about halfway through this novel, whilst the plot was fairly interesting I found the characters themselves rather 2 dimensional.It was the unconvincing portrayal of the characters that led to me just not careing enough about them to finish the book. the final straw came when the when the computer wizard (who, by the way, is obsessed with making love with a facimile of his dead sister of all things!) begins to program genetic mutations like retractable claws and venomous fangs in people. Such comic book science soundly terminated the suspension of this readers disbelief. Had the author invested more into creating more belivable (and Interesting) characters I would have finished what had started out as a promising read."
4,"Worth the wait, when's the next?","Read the other other reviews for particulars on this story, my focus is on the author. Mitchell's first book, Murphy's Gambit, has an early Heinlein feel to it. Then Technogenesis had a later Heinlein feel ala The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. I expected The Changeling Plague to build on Technogenesis, but it's different vision and a different feel, let's call it her own style. Mitchell handles the story well, and stays in control when the storyline goes off on a whole different tack.My complaints with The Changeling Plague are mostly minor nits that would be clutter here. The story is good, the ideas are interesting and well worth SF exploration. A couple of things will be much harder to do when science can do them, but that's okay, this is still hard SF. It'll be fun to watch Mitchell's career grow."
4,It's refreshing to read a science fiction novel by a scientist.,"Other than a few minor fallacies about DNA replication, the science behind this novel is solid. It's also well written and entertaining. I'm keeping this one in my library."
3,Best glove ever,I have to say these are the best gloves I have ever used. I am a professional electrician and need to have extreme dexterity to do everything from individual wires to connectors. I could differentiate screws within my pocket with these gloves on and yet my hands were warm in the winter. The only downfall and reason for the 3 stars is the gloves fell apart spontaneously after 1 month. Almost all the wear surfaces gave way at once. They are great gloves but may not be right for continuous use over a 40 hour work week.
2,"Nice fit, but durability problems","Granted that handling prunings from fruit trees is a stress application for a work glove, but I was still disappointed that a seam in a finger failed on the third use. Nice fit, very comfortable, but I'm not going to buy another pair."
3,"Good for light duty, wear quickly when used all the time","As a professional plumber who does alot of renovations dealing with some very tough material, I found that these gloves held up as well as a good pair of leather gloves. The price is about the same (I paid more for mine someplace else), but the dexterity with the Ironclads is excellent. I'm trying the heavy duty ones to see if they last any longer."
1,smaller than advertised,"Looks like Ironclad gloves I have used in the past, but even ordering a size larger than indicated by the size chart it is still too small. Very disappointing. Will give gloves to someone with smaller hands"
2,"Overpriced, quality issues","These seem like pretty decent gloves though mine had some questionable stitching in a few areas and was completely missing around one of the ""Iron Clad"" logo. And even without these flaws I would still say these are bit overpriced for the quality."
1,Ironclad gloves,"I have had several pairs of Ironclad gloves that were quite satisfactory; HOWEVER, the last pair purchased started coming apart immediately. The closure at the wrist (on one glove) fell off the first time I wore them. ALL of the stitching is unraveling.Sadly, it appears their quality has declined significantly."
2,Iron Clad framers gloves,"Big deal.I,ve had better luck with weightlifters gloves.2 weeks time and they started to unravel. The terry cloth for wiping sweat is a good idea though. Hardly worth the 20 bucks Ipaid for them."
1,Work Gloves,"I have just bought my first and last pair of Ironclad gloves because I am very disappointed with the fit and feel. This glove is just a bmx glove with a cute name. The ""original"" glove made by Mechanix Wear is a far superior product because it was designed specifically for use as a work glove. But don't just take my word for it, try them both and I'm sure you'll agree that the Mechanix glove is a much better product."
4,The Ironclad Glove,"I have worked with Ironclad products before, and from just looking at these gloves, I'm buying them. The sturdyness of the products that Ironclad has put out in the past will certanly be present, even in these gloves.Mitchell B"
3,rocket racer,"I was so excited to get this for my son, but it broke after only a few runs. I would only buy this again for display purposes."
3,Be Encouraged,"I found the songs Heaven, Wait On the Lord, and Encouraged to be very uplifting while the rest of the CD didn't spark much interest from me. The great music and lyrical arrangements on the aforementioned songs make-up for the continuity the rest of the CD lacks. However, the best way to rate a Gospel CD is to listen yourself and this one is worth trying on for size!"
5,SLR quality from a compact camera!,"This is a standout performer among the compact 35mm cameras due to the aspherical glass lens (highly, highly unusual for this class of camera), wide zoom range, compact size and array of features (date, flash options, self-timer, infared remote activated shutter, and carrying case). My trusty Canon SLR with a broad assortment of lenses gets little use. Hats off to Minolta for setting a new standard."
3,didn't fit on kodak,"For all the hype about this lens and the price tag you would THINK it would fit on most cameras? no. Didn't even line up correctly with my kodak disposable camera, nor my polaroid."
3,Very practical...,"I found this hotel guide very helpful when planning our trip to southern florida. Because it is well designed, is is very easy to use and not overly suffocating, in terms of too much information. A good buy!"
3,not this one,"No, Pav is not in good shape this time. Rondino al nido finale is lost. The Gospel Choir, what are they doing there ? Try "" Pav. in the Park ""(Hyde Park, London), voice is unsurpassed."
5,Ideal guide book!,"Just returned from our 2nd Annual Bar Harbor trip. This book is extremely helpful and accurate. We've used the majority of hiking and biking trails with this book, but no kayak trips yet. Totally recommend!"
4,A general guide to outdoor activities in Acadia,"Good book, but very general in nature. We didn't paddle or bike. We only hiked. The included, weatherproof map is a great asset. The hiking descriptions were brief, but accurate. I would recommend this book to anyone who is new to Acadia and wants to explore with a minimum of guidance. If you are specifically going to hike and do some very fun peak bagging, buy the Acadia Trail map in Bar Harbor."
2,Better books out there,"I was very disappointed in this book. Though I was interested in the biking information, I am mainly a hiker, and the information on trails was woefully lacking. Sure, the map in the back was great, but I can buy a trail map when I actually get there. My time in Acadia is going to be very short, and I need something to help me chose which hikes I want to take BEFORE I arrive. This book was not it. Gave it two stars instead of one because of the map and biking information, though in all honestly, I haven't looked at any other books on biking to compare it with. I have looked at another hiking book -- Hiking Acadia National Park by Dolores Kong, a MUCH better book, in my opinion."
2,Disappointed in map,"The Amazon preview pages would not work, so I bought this book soley on the user reviews. Wow, am I disappointed. I would recommend ""Hiking Acadia N.P."" instead. It gives you page size maps of your hike, not a huge fold up, pull out map you have to squint to see because of the colors and items. Also Hiking Acadia has an additional overall map with all the trails numbered so you can easily visualize where everything is. If you can't preview inside pages either, try going to Google books instead. Refunds?"
5,fast delivery and fit the blender container.,Wish they had sent the diag. on how the washers should be installed as the old ones I could not see which ones went on the glass etc. had to get the diag. from Waring on line.
2,Beware of chipping paint,"My 3-year old son loved this kazoo. He figured out how to use it really quickly and it makes a great kazoo sound (unlike the cheap plastic ones that you get at party stores). But I had to throw this kazoo away because he was clamping it in his mouth with his teeth and the paint chipped off very easily. The paint chips were actually getting in his mouth and this was only after about 2 days of using it. I was very disappointed because the quality looked good initially, but now I'm going to look for a metal kazoo without paint. I think it would be ok for older kids as long as they understand not to scrape it with their teeth."
1,paint chips,my toddler loves this toy but the paint chips very easily. they really should have kept the mouth area unpainted.
2,paint chips,my toddler loves this toy but the paint chips. they really should have kept the mouth area free of paint.
5,Perfect Instrument!,"Who doesn't love the kazoo! It's an instrument that anyone can play and kids will love it! My friends and I put together a ridiculous singing group in college for the talent show one year and decided to use kazoos to ""tune"" at the beginning of our performance. It got a laugh out of the audience and we had fun playing with them."
3,not his best,"this is an ok cd, but the evil stuff is missin, its just a 4 song ep, but its not all bad its got the old school soundin beats like in ""cruisin down 7 mile"" and ""homey dont play"" grab it if your a fan"
4,Two solid early Duke efforts.,"FLAME OF THE BARBARY COAST: The Duke vs. Joseph Schildkraut for the heart of Ann Dvorak and dominance of the San Francisco gambling scene. Wayne is smart and strong, Dvorak is beautiful and unobtainable and Schildkraut is charming and both conniving and dignified. William Frawley provides guidance and laughs as Duke's mentor, Wolf Wiley. This is a classic love triangle/rivalry, the kind that has sustained literature down through the ages.SANTA FE STAMPEDE: John Wayne, Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan and Max Terhune made several Republic Westerns where they played a group of friends known as the Three Mesquiteers. This is one of their better outings. Wayne is framed for a murder he did not commit and faces lynching at the hands of an angry mob. (The titular Stampede)Will his friends be able to save him in time? I'm not telling, but you probably know the answer. This is a fun Republic oater with decent action and some funny comic bits by Terhune and his ventriloquist dummy."
1,item shipped not 40mm,A good quality product however it is not a 40mm lens shade. Does not fit my Leupold pre 2004 gloss rifle scope.
3,The silver frame is hokey,"But it still looks good from a distance. The silver frame looks like it ought to be jewel encrusted or something, but instead is just this rough-surfaced metal."
5,Feast Your Eyes and Soul on This Print,"THE SOUL OF THE ROSE (painted 1908) is one of the most beautiful paintings by John William Waterhouse, the English Pre-Raphaelite inheritor who specialized in beauty. The very sight of this painting conjures up the scent of a rose garden on a warm spring day. Look and let your eyes delight in the fresh and vivid colors of the picture: the deep turquoise of the lady's medieval gown, the blush and strawberry pink of the roses, the green of the leaves, the shining silver of the beads in the lady's auburn hair. Notice too how masterfully Waterhouse has rendered her hands, with their exceptionally long and slender fingers; one rests, slightly tense, on the wall, while the other curves gracefully around the stem of a plump rose. Reproduced here in a large standard size, THE SOUL OF THE ROSE is an essential print to decorate the homes of Waterhouse admirers and/or rose-lovers."
1,Don't buy it!,"I can't imagine why this game was produced. There aren't very many cards (not even a full deck), and the questions are dated and obscure. It love the tin cansister that the card come in though. Too bad!"
5,She's Done it Again!,"On a whim, I saw this at the bookstore, and lo and behold. A new series from the creator who brought us the haunting and lovely, Vampire Princess Miyu. Except this series, has a lighter atmosphere while still proving to be dramatic with a flair as only Narumi Kakinouchi can do. We are immersed in a world where martial arts is a way of life and always has been. We meet Juline, heir to her clan, along with a great cast of characters. It seems that there's a new clan in town by the name of Black Pearl that popped up in the middle of the night out of nowhere. Members from other clans are also leaving to join Black Pearl and it seems Black Pearl has a hidden agenda. It's up to Juline to find out..."
3,"to much bark, not enough bite","Had high hopes for this movie since i'm a fan of the comic by STEVE NILES, but it ends up being the same old crap...why can't a group of bad a$$ vampires just kill everyone instead of taking their sweet time killing them off 1 by 1 by 1...the vampires look awesome, no twlight shiny vamps here, and tons of blood it's worth buying if you can get it cheap enough, it all depends on your favorite kind of horror, i'm a slasher movie guy so this movie is just o.k for me"
2,WOW,I think the director played alot of left for dead cause the whole time I kept thinking this would be a ok left for dead movie. But it is suposed to be a sequal to the awesome first film. Save your money and netflix it. Worth a rent cause the guy from the edge and the guy from entourage make this at least watchable.
3,It's Okay,"This sequel as far as I am concern did not do a good job measuring up to the first movie. It had it's moments, but not like you would expect. The acting was good, that's what the three stars is for. It could have been better, but not a complete loss, somewhat predictable."
3,Average performance,"Although I recognized the connection from the original movie,I felt the plot lack depth and development. This sequel notnearly as intensely involving as the original."
2,Not a Good Follow-Up to #1,"""Dark Days"" should have been a good movie. I loved the first one, and loved the novels, of which ""Dark Days"" is the second. I sort of stand by this movie out of loyalty to the awesome concept that is ""30 Days"", especially when dealing with horror-haters! But truly, it didn't have the first movie's razor-like clarity of plot and effects. The plot got muddled; it didn't cover half of what I got from the novel. The effects got sloppy and repetitive, the characters vague. There were still some of the chilling, gorgeous visuals, and a good sense of vampire ruthlessness. Just suffer through the dialogue and baldly planted vampire goth chix, and Imagine that these actors are the originals... there's a bit of sentimental value."
2,ok,This movie is ok but its nothing like the original and is almost a B movie compared to it. Storyline isn't is good either.
4,dark days,almost as good as the first showed signs of getting there but didn't quite make the grade.seemed to finish like the budget ran out.
2,The first movie is BETTER,I only bought this movie because I have the first 30 days of night. The first movie is a good movie to watch. I enjoy it each time. 30 days of night: Dark Days is an ok movie. I don't mind watching it. But I hate that I spent $5 on it.
2,BAD SEQUEL,"SO THIS IS THE SEQUEL? I don't know where to start. It wasn't that great. The ending of the movie epitomized the deplorable script writing. Stella is attempting to tell the world about vampires while the government is trying to cover it up. The local FBI man is in cahoots with the vampires as he desires to be one. A group of vampire hunters meets Stella in her room and asks her to join them (along with a turncoat vampire) to go into the underground tunnels of L.A. and hunt down and kill Lilith, the vampire queen. Lilith speaks a strange tongue with subscripts, until the very end when she can suddenly speak English. The acting wasn't all that great. This is another movie which uses the high tech ""special effect"" of jerking the camera around to make us feel the terror of the scene (yawn!) because the script can't do it.Lilith, in ancient folklore, fed off the blood on infants. They seemed to have messed that up too. If you watched the first one, go ahead and get disappointed on this one."
2,First one rocks...this one .....does not !,I think they tried too hard to take a sucessfull formula and change it to becomesomething else...and it did not work as good. At the beginning you can see thereis a good chance that it might go in the right direction...then the story unfoldsand your left with a movie that looks like multiple other movies.Its watchable...but i dont consider it a keeper.
1,Warning: Has NOTHING to do with original aside from references!,"Do NOT waste your time or money on this complete let down :( This ""sequel"" has nothing to do with the first other than a few tie in references and is not the least bit frightening whatsoever! SUPER-LOW BUDGET TRASH! I wondered why Melissa George (Stella from original) didn't return and then it hit me...She must have read the script!**Small Spoiler-entire film takes place in what appears to be One-Two warehouses and a ship?!AVOID!"
2,Lost Practically Everything that Made the First Film Great,"The first ""30 Days of Night"" was enjoyable because of the sense of isolation created by the remoteness of Barrow and the constant danger the characters faced from nearly the beginning of the movie to the end as they try to survive until the next sunrise. This sequel, based in Los Angeles, fails to recreate that feeling so whenever the characters are not in danger the movie just drags.Instead of trying to create its' own original elements as the first film did, ""Dark Days"" borrows some from such movies as ""John Carpenter's: Vampires"" and ""Underworld"" and leaves you feeling like you've seen all this before."
2,30 Days of NIght 2,I loved the first movie but this one is a huge let down. It just doesn't have the same impact as the first. I am glad it was never released at the movie theater.
1,"Sad, just sad.","I loved 30 Days of Night, and was extremely excited that they were making a sequel.. I saw it on the shelf and picked it up for the wifey who is an avid fan of Vamps. Tool it home and watched... Wow, all I can say is save your money and just re-watch the first film. This is the sorriest bunch of vampire hunters you will ever see in your life. I bet the Corey's from the Lost Boys could do more damage than these wimps. In the end, an absolute disappointment. Horrible pacing, terrible acting, and a sad follow up to what was one of the best Vampire films of the new millenium.STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM."
1,terrible... just terrible,"I LOVED 30 Days of Night... this movie however is just terrible. It's bland, generic, predictable and just not good in any way in my opinion.Seriously I predicted the entire Dane thing and Eben thing by the end of the opening credits.It may be faithful to the second graphic novel, I don't know I didn't read it. I understand it was a smaller budget film but this was just inexcusably bad. the writing, the dialogue, all of it.I'm actually disappointed that I could have bought the original on blu-ray for less than I paid for this. it's like they tried to frankenstein together ""30 days of night"", ""Daybreakers"" and ""Blade trinity"" into a coherent storyline using the cheapest actors they could find and get them to play characters that always make the worst decision possible.Save your money, watch it online before you buy it and I don't see how this is getting 5-star reviews but clearly those reviewers saw something worthwhile I did not."
1,Waste of money!!!!,"What a waste of 92 minutes! I've been awaiting the release of this sequel since i viewed the first. I loved 30 Days of Night, but Dark Days was such a disappointment. I'm not even sure why ""30 Days of Night"" was in the title. This movie was like a very bad cross between Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Blade. The vampires didn't look the same, and regular bullets could fatally wound them. The story line made no sense and the end... well even more stupid. If you must watch this movie please don't purchase. RENT!!!!"
2,30 Days of terrible,"30 Days of Night: Dark Days tries to be a woman vampire action film in certain parts. It has dull women both as vampires, and vampire hunters. They are so tedious to watch though. It is filled with impossible, ridiculous and even painful battles in Los Angeles and vampire massacres, many with no explanation since none could be hoped for.The vampire hunting characters, one of whom we recognized as being played by a member of the cast of ""Lost,"" launch poorly conceived or planned attacks on vampires in dark ghettos. They do diametrically reversed and polar opposite things and get into harm's way so idiotically that you, too, will be quivering then scoffing and finally puking every minute.The acting is terrible, the script is stupid, and the vampires are not even scary. Mia Kirshner is definitely miscast as the evil vampire leader, she's so boring.If you're looking for to be frightened, you won't really find it in 30 Days of Night: Dark Days."
2,Not Great,"I did enjoy the first 30 Days of Night. It isn't an all time favorite, but I thought it was effective and well made. This direct to dvd low budget sequel just doesn't hit on any level. Stella the only survivor of the first encounter(different actress in the part) goes around the country trying to tell people through lectures that vampires killed 98 people in Alaska and not an oil fire mishap. I'm not sure why the highly organized vampires wouldn't just kill her for trying to expose them. Instead they wait until she meets up with a group of vampire hunters ala Blade II before they decide to try and take her out. The acting is very flat and the characters don't garner much sympathy, the vampires and rules of the vampires have changed from the first movie. If you loved the first movie I know you will want to just make a blind buy, but I think everyone should rent this before purchasing."
2,This movie sucks!!,This movie really sucks compared too the 1st one. I do not recommend watching it.
3,Very Fancy,"This book is full of good information, but it is very fancy. It is not real practical for someone who just wants to preserve food. I was looking for more canning recipes, and it doesn't have many for meat and fish."
4,Bring on the Mosh,"Well what can I say if you love tuff guy hardcore then you will love this album. Figure Four are a Christian band too but compared to some of the other secular tuff guy hardcore bands these guys stand there grounds. This album is great from the beginning to the end. If your in to bands like Untill the End, hatebreed,Buried Alive then you should consider buying this album. Figure four are one of the best bands on Face down records and I would say this is there best stuff to date."
4,Pricey but nice,Very nice big block. Very thick and fits great on the counter. Had a 2ft x 2ft area next to stove top and this fits great. Haven't used it a ton yet so will see. Very heavy. Also made sure to get the conditioner - don't want it to crack due to poor care.
1,Terrible quality,"This product arrived with a small crack in one piece of wood that we decided to overlook because otherwise it was in fine shape. Then we noticed separation occurring between the pieces. After the return window closed on this item, separation began to develop along more and more of the joints between the wood, this despite careful oiling of the board on a regular basis. Now just three months after receiving it, the board looks horrible. We are very, very disappointed in this product. More of the wood separates as time goes on. I wish these problems would have occurred before the return window closed. Now we are stuck with a 30 lb paperweight. Awful!***UPDATE*** I contacted the manufacturer who sent me a brand new board immediately, no questions asked. They were courteous and quick to respond. This board is beautiful and has no issues whatsoever. I was very impressed with their customer service. Well done."
5,Great Cutting Board,"Great cutting board. Have used it several times every day and not a mark on it. Doesn't dull the knives. Very happy with this board. We keep it properly oiled, and expect it will last a life time."
5,Worth every penny!!,"This massive, robust slab of fine craftsmanship is everything a cutting board should be. Looks great, works great and compliments the newly remodeled kitchen. It is definitely thirsty for Oil, so buy a lot."
3,"great little camera, but it broke within 3 months","This is a great little camera. Small, takes great snapshots, and has lots of cool features. In fact i used, that is USED past tense, it often instead of my other ""high end"" camera.One day after taking fotos with no problems, it would not close, retract the lens and turn off. I sent it in to Pentax service, which after two weeks sent me an ""itemized estimate for 182.00 , and claimed that I had broken it. Itemized ""repairs"" included a replacing the plastic casing due to a scuff on the upper corner, where it had been scuffed about 2 weeks after I bought it. This wasn't the problem. I really felt they were welching on their warranty.All in all, a great little cheap camera, but beware. It broke and the warranty was worthless."
4,Great camera for the price!,This camera seems great for the price. It is a simple point and shoot camera with some cool features. I don't know much about digital cameras but it looks like a pretty good camera for someone that just wants to take some simple pictures. It also cost a less that other cameras with similar features.
4,great read,"I'm not going to go into the details of the plot but instead say the book moves quickly, it does not deviate from the plot too much compared to other of Smiths books , and the characters work fantastically. Tiki is as vicious as always but plays the role of hunter perfectly and Bandit is one of the best characters in the shadow run series in my opinion. The good thing about this book is the other characters work well with the plot , however I am still not convinced on a few of the supporting characters such as Mork and Minx as an example.Overall this is a good book which I would recommend. I think personally this is the best that he wrote in the Shadowrun series and after reading this one wished he kept to this style of writing and this style of novel compared to his previous attempts."
2,boring at best..,"Instead of being suspenseful, you can't wait for these cheesy and predictable characters to be swallowed whole. The shark is great due to its size, but the graphics do not let you forget its fake. Walking megalodon... walking tank... even the bikini contest was lame... this movie is definitrly a let down."
4,Supershark,"There isn't much of a story, but if you like shark movies it is worth a watch. This shark can walk on land, lol, If you go in to it knowing it is bad you will get laughs out of it. This is worth a rental."
3,watch if you don't have anything else,"It's okay if you don't expect a lot from this movie. Computer generated creatures, fake blood, generic acting, but it keeps you occupied if you're bored silly"
5,Kensington table top Surge protector 62634,"This surge protector design works wonderfully with my classic HP 110+ laptop computer, ThinkJet printer and HP 9114B disk drive. All these devices require a 110 to milliamp cord adapter. The neat layout of the Smartsockets on the Kensington surge protector permits the side by side plug in of the HP adapter plugs. Goodbye to the old linear surge protectors that restricted the number of adapters that could be powered. I love the 16 foot cord that allows me great freedom to locate conveniently my classic computer system wherever I choose.Thank you, Kensington. DOS commands still LIVE. I love my classic HP system."
2,constant humming while on,"I was so excited to get this but when I plug it in, it constantly hums-almost to a white noise volume. Any suggestions?"
1,Expensive and uses too much space,"This is a nice try, but unfortunately, this item requires all the plugs to fit outside the circle making it very big when you have 6 transformers plugged in. I use the ezSpace UFO. The plugs face the middle and all my wired can be grouped together for a very neat efficient fit.CB"
5,A practical approach to learning calculus,"This is the only book I recommend to someone learning calc for the first time.Larson's approach is practical, logical, thorough, and most importantly, CLEAR!!!!"
1,where's my book???,"I was charged and informed that the textbook was shipped. Waited for weeks and then received a personal check from the so-called ""seller"". I thought I ordered the book from Amazon.com but why did this person got the order from me? He was nice to send me the check, BUT I was charged for $26.95 for the book and the shipment. What happened to my other portion of the money??? And not to mention about the time I waited looking forward to have the book."
4,Good but problems were too easy,Not bad at all! I found the book's explanations pretty easy to understand.The CD I really did not use. Some of you probably got more use out of it. But the text and diagrams are well enough done that I found the CD unnecessary.The only criticism is that perhaps some of the problems could have been harder/more challenging.
3,Calculus With Analytic Geometry Review,"Although it is quite an old edition, Mathematics has not changed that much in the past years. Great quality and very useful"
4,The Ideal case for ZIP and 3.5 diskettes,"As a college professor of Computer Information Systems, I store lecture material, and class problems on ZIP disks for carrying back and forth from my home to my school system and for backup. Until I discovered these cases I often had a ZIP disk wrapped in paper because the original case had been dropped and had broken. These cases are ideal because I can have a ZIP and two 3.5 disks in the same pack to much better organize my materials. Dropping them does not break them. As far as I have found, there is no other alternative. I am now recommending them to my students."
5,All kinds of mommies,"What a delightful book! My 3 year old daughter loves this book as it is filled with many types of Mommies, human and animal, and how they take care of thier young. Espcially nice to see is the human mom breastfeding her baby (no bottles in sight--other animals nurse their young too!). The book shows protective moms and busy moms and sweet moms and ""wild"" moms (yes, there is a tattooed and peirced mom with green hair--so what, lets teach our children NOT to judge people by their looks!) And of course all the animal counterparts.If you want a wonderful book showing the all the great qualities human moms have and who their counterparts are in the animal kingdom, plus a great introduction to animals in general, then I highly suggest you buy this book!"
4,"Sencillo, lleno de ideas y con un poco de nuestra realidad.","Esta es la primera novela de Mario Benedetti, es una obra pequeña y nos narra nuestra tragedia personal junto con la psicologia de los malos entendidos por falta de comunicacion en las relaciones entre parejas. Benedetti es un gran autor Latinoamericano y puede convertirse en un gran maestro de iniciacion hacia la Literatura Latinoamericana, la lectura de esta novela junto con su gran obra ""La Tregua"" son una excelente manera de comenzar a adentrarse en este genero tan bello. A esta obra no le doy 5 estrellas porque seria injusto con obras mas elaboradas y con mas contenido pero su lectura la recomiendo ampliamente."
2,I really wanted to like this album,"I absolutely love Danielson's earlier work, especially the alpha and omega albums, and so it took a while to figure out what was wrong this time around. Yes- Danielson is an aquired taste, yes- its not for everyone, yes- you either love em or hate em. I love em, but I do not love this album.My problem, and if you are a fan and being honest with yourself you too will realize, there are no catchy songs on this album. Nothing stays with me, no melodies pop into my head that I enjoy going over and over with. The effort feels forced and to use a sports term, Daniel feels like he is ""pressing"". I ended up selling my copy at the local used CD store..."
1,"Put me in the ""hate 'em"" camp","An acquired taste at best, The Danielson Famile are a bizarre mix of The Flaming Lips, Victoria Williams, Violent Femmes and They Might Be Giants. I like all of the above mentioned acts individually, but throwing them into the blender of Danielson Famile just doesn't work for me. Try before you buy on this one, kids. After a couple of spins, my copy has joined the ""recycle"" pile."
1,Odd Selections,"This CD does not present the Marine band at its best. A lot of the music presented here looks like it was intended for internal use only and was never meant to be sold to the public for profit by a private none-goverment recording company. This would account for the odd selection of music, and the limited playing time of under 50 minutes."
3,Time capsule,"This movie deals with a time period long past, and it is hard to take it seriously. The main character is played by Linda Hamilton, an actress who epitomizes the 1980ies and who I just happen to like. She plays an innocent Russian girl who is recruted into a kind of an academy and turned into a ""bait"" for Americans targeted for blackmail schemes by the Soviets. Nobody cared about authenticity as far as the Russian settings are concerned, but the moral conflicts the heroine runs into are handled with tact."
4,Sexploitation Movie,I Liked this film. All of the cast were really good against a Pretty good Script.Linda Hamilton was very Sexy In her roll. W ether It happened Probably Did.
3,good story,Received item in a timely manner. Great condition and price. Like Linda Hamilton in it and thought the ending was an all win situation
1,secret weapons DVD,"This movie sucked, it was very boring and that's sad because I like linda hamilton and gena davis. the movie wasn't worth it."
3,It's a battery.,Bought this because it made my whole order ship for free. It sits nicely in a smoke detector waiting to save my life. Atleast till I replace it for siting around for too long.
1,took exactly 4 months for delivery,"I ordered it June 4th, it came Oct 1st, after they asked me 3 times ""do you still want it"". It was delivered from Amazon.co - LLC. I don't know how is the battery itself because I don't need it anymore."
3,Okay battery not worth 1.50,"I used it for a smoke alarm in my house. Apparently, it didnt contain enough juice to power the alarm. I used it in a remote control instead. Works just fine. I have a feeling that a duracell or energizer would probably be better since they have more power."
5,Great for Free Shipping,This was a great add on to get free shipping and worked really well in my smoke detector.
5,Science Fair project,My daughter just finished her science fair project and I can honestly say this battery beat out a couple of name brands. In the beginning it had a minimum of .5 volts greater then all of the other brands. When tested with a non-calibrated DMM it read at 10.0 volts which was very nice. The experiment had the batteries attached to 9v flashlights and out of all the brands this brand lasted the longest. So I would have to say this is a good buy.
1,disappointed,"i had ordered this item expecting good things from it. however, the article has never worked properly. the electrical system seems to be working fine, but the uv light has never come on. somehow it seems pointless to have a toothbrush sanitizer that does not sanitize. right now the product is only a toothbrush holder; nothing more. i generally do not pay such a high price for a toothbrush holder. i have been in contact with the producer of the product and hope to have something done about it. in short, i won't buy anything like this again."
1,Doesn't hold electric toothbrush heads,"This product has 3 holes for regular toothbrushes, but no hole for an electric toothbrush head. I propped my sonicare head in there sideways, which worked until the head fell into one of the holes. Once it fell into the hole, it fell into the abyss in the bottom of the container, and there is NO EASY way to get it out. The heads cost $7 each, so leaving it in there wasn't an option. I had to stick a screwdriver in from the bottom, and force the head back up and out (this took me 10 minutes). All they need is a small round insert to place into one of the holes to keep the electric heads from falling through. I am going to modify mine so I can use this (my husband and daughter use regular toothbrushes), but I would not have bought this if I knew it couldn't accomodate my toothbrush."
1,Product is not what is listed.,"This product states 4 toothbrushes. That is incorrect, it only holds 3.This product also states 4 AA batteries or AC Adapter. That is also incorrect. You cannot use 4 AA.I felt that was misleading and unfortunately unless to me.If those things don't bother you, it might be what you are looking for, but since it does bother me, i never even tried it."
3,"Kids love it, but breaks VERY easily","After reading other reviews that said how easily this broke, I bought 2 of these for my 16-month old. A friend of ours has one that she loved, and I'd searched for months trying to find it (without knowing the name of this toy). Both my 5- and 3- year olds love this too! It's a very cool little toy, but it really does break easy. My son dropped this on our linoleum kitchen floor... the red and blue handle snapped in half like it was nothing... quite a waste of $5. on the other one, the battery compartment won't stay securely on. I had to tape it down. Make this more sturdy, and it'll fly off the shelves better... its just the weakest plastic I've ever seen in my life... so beware of that!"
1,Arrived Used and Broken,"This toy arrive in terrible shape. Discolored, obviously used, covered in an oily residue, which was also in small droplets inside the globe itself. The globe was scraped up and the batteries leaked causing rust on the battery connectors. SO THE OILY SUBSTANCE IS PROBABLY ACID OR WORSE WHICH IS NOW CAUSING DISCOMFORT ON MY SKIN EVEN AFTER IT IS WASHED OFF. To top things off the toy wouldn't work with brand new Duracell batteries! For $5.99 I cannot waste the time to send it back!! Lesson - don't buy from Hobby Trading Company...EVERMeteor Storm LED Changing Pattern Spinner Wand!!!!"
1,Very disappointed-broken when it arrived,"We love this toy. We had one that we bought in a store several years ago and my girls LOVED it!! So when I saw them on amazon.com I had to buy some new ones. Unfortunately, when they arrived, one of them was already broken when we opened the box. Very disappointed in the quality of these toys. The one we had bought in a ""brick and mortar"" store has lasted for 3 years with my daughter playing with it all the time. It broke when a friend bashed it over and over again on a tile floor. But these online ones seem very flimsy and broke easily. Will not order again from here."
2,"Great attention keeper, just doesn't last long.","Babies, infants, and toddlers love it. Received it on the 10 of March though and it stopped working within 3 weeks with easy use. Not durable at all and this was our second one."
4,Great Baby Mesmerizer,"We use these as Baby Mesmerizers in our family. If you have a crying infant during a car ride, just have whoever is sitting next to the baby hold this up for the baby to see, and the baby will instantly be fascinated by the swirling colored lights and stop crying!"
3,Wouldn't survive a drop,"My 3 years old daughter loved it and it was fun until she dropped it on a floor the day after she got it. The battery cap broke and some parts inside the globe went loose. Even though she loved it I won't be buying a replacement, we'll go with some other flashing lights toy."
4,Photography Class Suggested Reading,"Much more detailed than the book that came with the camera. Has helpful hints and is easier to understand. I took a photography class recently, and the instructor suggested I get this book to better understand my camera. He was right."
3,The Yes of Mamas and Papas,"3 1/2FD may sound more influential than innovative, but their pop-harmony arranging prowess cannot be overstated, peppering any dated predictability with a deeper finesse rarely seen during the time."
5,A model of exposition,"John Conway's books are always well written, and this could serve as a model for other mathematics authors. I don't need to know that much about quaternions and octonions, but I found myself working through most of the book and the beautiful mathematics it covers. The only thing that disappoints is the dreadful cover and the difficulty getting hold of a copy in a bookstore. But then I guess Amazon.com exists to help people get their hands on stuff they might never see in a bookstore."
3,Could be better,"Good solid weapon, but blade heavy. Blue Gauntlet sabres for the same price are better balanced."
1,did not work for me,I followed the directions exactly for 6 weeks and this product turned my ornamental pond into a slough. Water is murky and dirty looking. I would not recommend using!
3,Pondcare Pond Zyme+enzymatic,It need to work with other equipment (UV light). It will not get the water clean by using only this product. Again cleaning filter is the key.
2,No Help,"Had no affect on the green water in my pond. Perhaps my pond was too far gone when I began to use it, but it does claim to clear all water and had absolutely no affect on the water clarity."
3,I'm amazed at this design flaw!!,"I'm amazed at this design flaw. I don't have space to wall mount this phone, so It must sit on my desk. However, when it sits on the desk, the display is tilted backwards (away from the person sitting at the desk), so I must stand up to read caller id display (to decide if I want to answer the phone). How annoying. The whole reason I got a speakerphone was so that I could work uninterrupted at my desk if I wanted to answer calls. Now I have to stop my work and stand up to decide. If you can wall mount this phone, the display would be easily visible, and the phone might otherwise work great. I never got as far as to try it."
3,very nice with one major exception,"The answering machine does not allow the volume to be turned off -- so everyone in the house can hear the message being left. Not much good if privacy is an issue. Basically makes this useless for my purpose. If you tell your guests to ignore the phone as ""the answering machine will get it"" this is nice but everyone will be listening to the message..."
2,You get what you pay for,"It was very hard to find a good quality corded phone and after this phone I can still say the same thing. I had read previous reviews before I had purchased it and thought it sounded pretty decent. But, when I received it I found similiar problems other customer had found. You cannot check your messages from the remote, even the customer service provided by the company could not get it to work. Another problem is the fact that there is only 1 min of recording time so most of my messages were cut off. In the owners manual under trouble shooting it says ""it is the cause of a caller pausing for more that 7 seconds"" and the way to correct it is ""have the caller speak continuously w/out any pauses."" Should this be the message I leave on my machine ""please leave a message less than 60 sec. w/ out taking a breath thanks"" I returned it and am in the process of looking for a new one."
1,"Recording Time listed misleading, 60 sec max per message",The Recording Time listed (14 minutes max) is misleading because individual incoming messages are limited to a 60 second maximum and then it cuts your caller off! Your outgoing message is also limited to a 30 second maximum. Neither of these restrictions was listed in the description; I didn't find this out until I read the owner's manual upon receipt. These restrictions made this product unsuitable for my purposes and I was very disappointed.
3,Remote Voice mail check doesn't work,"For the price that I paid for, it's a no brainer to use this phone. The speaker sound quality is pretty good. It has all the features that I wanted: Caller I.D. and voice mail system. I work with fancy computer gadgets every day. And, this time, I wanted a ""VERY EASY"" phone to use. This is the one. Except one thing: the remote voice mail checking function does not work. So, now I have to contact the phone manufacturer to get this fixed."
1,Stay away from this product,"Very bad product as others have said. We've had this phone for over a year and it's been nothing but problems. Poor phone quality, frustrating anwsering machine, not able to use remote access feature. Now it has a really loud background hum. Final straw. We will replace shortly."
2,Avoid this phone,"This phone comes with good features, but it performs very poorly. Answering machine messages are virtually unintelligible, and it is very difficult to hear and understand people through the handset. I wish I never bought this phone. If you think the price is too good to be true, you're right."
3,not dependable,I have this phone a while. It has never been smooth sailing; something was always not working properly. There are better phones out there.
2,Would not recommend,"I have put up with phone for a year and I am now looking to replace it. The sound quality of playedback messages is terrible. The message recording time cuts off most messages. You cannot turn down the volume on messages that are playing back, so my neighbor 3 doors down can hear them. There is no way to retrieve messages when you call in. To delete the message is very frustrating and time consuming."
3,so and so,Is agood book but not too much information.There are some others more complete.In any case is good for starting
5,Great Book!,Goes into great detail on what's needed to repair clocks and how to do it. This is probably the best basic book I have seen and has given me the confidence to tackle one.
2,Form without function,"Looks nice, but the rigid surface doesn't allow the mouse ball much grip; after one day, I switched back to a plain square pad."
3,Interesting book on alleys in Amsterdam,"This book, in Dutch, gives an overview of all the narrow alleys in Amsterdam that you would most likely pass without looking at them, let alone enter them. Maybe now you will!!Downside: it's a little personal and sometimes a lot of shops are named and as we all know they tend to change every year, so you might lose track."
3,Little bit disappointing,"I had to wait a lot to finally get this agenda in my hands and although I find it beatiful, it doesn't have spaces for my name, my friends phone numbers or notes, and the comments are superflous. So I'm a little bit disappointed."
3,aiwa stereo system,"We purchased this system because it seemed to offer the flexibility and features we desired... like digital and cable interface. However, in no time at all -- after the warranty was out, naturally -- the disc changer stopped reading discs and seemed to develop a mind of its own.It's time for another system, evidently. We won't buy this product again. I hate to say it, but maybe cheaper is better -- especially if you're going to be buying one of these every eighteen months."
4,A multi-dimensional romantic,"Finally, there is a truly multi-dimensional romantic artist who shows that there is more to life than love. He explores issues like nostalgia, melancholy and patriotism. How refreshing! He ranks up there with Patrick Fiori. They have a similar style and a similar attitude towards life."
1,"In a word, I would describe the music as ""cacophonous""","I was also on a class trip to DC in 2003 and received a copy of this CD for free (maybe even from the artist himself). It's terrible. Even getting it for free was paying too much. I'm almost willing to pay someone to take this off my hands! Unfortunately, that would require me going back to my parents house, digging through boxes of things to hopefully find it, and then sending it to you along with whatever we agree on for the price. Even then, it's still probably worth it just to be rid of this awful, awful CD.I would give this CD zero stars, but Amazon won't let me."
1,Same Here!,"WOW! I thought me and my friends were the only ones who knew about this guy. We were on a class trip to DC in 2003 and the street vendor told us he was going on Warp Tour so we bought it...what a mistake! However, it has provided us laughs over the years. We still bust it out from time to time. I think its funny that other people were also infected by this virus from the same zombie."
1,"don't be fooled, these gloves suck!","after three weeks of purchase, wearing them for only 3 1/2 days of continuous use, the stiching started to come apart. these gloves are a complete waste of money. i normally buy the blue vinyl gloves and they last 4-6 months of continuous use, unless i abuse them or use in a circumstance i know will tear them. but better the gloves than the hand. with the blue vinyl gloves, i can pick up a washer on a concrete slab. i've also bought leather gloves for 11.00 and cut off the fingers i use most often, just like the ironclad gloves offer. leather feels better than the ironclad. these gloves are just a gimic-gadget, not a quality, durable product, at least that has been my personal experience."
1,Ironclad? Doubt it.,"I used these gloves for about 2 weeks, delivering US mail, not framing houses. The thread on the middle finger of the right glove failed and the glove finger came apart.Save your money. Go to Home Depot and purchase a cheaper pair of Stanley gloves. They don't fall apart so easily."
3,"Great concept, don't last!","I bought these gloves to do a lighting strike job. They are basically torn-up after one 12-hour job. The idea is great, they have the three finger tips cut off so I can grip things, they have the terry cloth section on the thumbs for wiping sweat, they're just really great gloves. BUT, the problem is that after that one job, they're really torn up. They are fraying and just not holding up well. I know that if I wore them again they would be useless by the end of that next shift.Someone should really take this concept and make them more durable.I went to the website that is listed on the glove itself (iclad.com) and there is no website there anymore. These gloves must me old?If you need them for one gig, they're fantastic... if you need them to last you for a long time, look elsewhere."
5,great gloves,"I do elevator construction. the gloves are fantastic! I can wear them all day and do anything... even get change out of my pockets! they don't affect your dexterity at all.The only slight drawback is they don't have a good grip when hoisting or holding certain things... such as holding a large metal pipe in the air or pulling on a 3/4"" manilla rope. The palm surfaces don't grip that well. There is no problem with lumber.Since I dont do that constantly, they are fabulous!Every day after work, I have to wash my three fingertips! :::laughing:::"
3,Contractor's Use,"These gloves are durable for the first month as long as the don't get wet - then they shrink like O.J.'s gloves did. I have found that in handling OSB or other sheathing that the material is not quite capable of stopping the smallest of splinters from piercing your hand through the glove either. Aside from having to spend $25 a month to replace your gloves, one good aspect their ability to grip materials or help you hang onto a new roof loaded with sawdust...The Makita gloves are far superior - just not skin tight."
2,"great concept, poor performance","Didn't get a week's worth of work out of these before they started to unravel. And at 55, I'm only half the roughneck I used to be. Save your money."
2,High hopes dashed,"I had been searching for a quality work glove with ""feel"" for years, thought I found it in these gloves. I was unfortunately let down. Great gloves, great ""feel"", wore out in less than a month."
3,improvements,"Even though my framer's gloves are falling apart, I have gotten my money's worth as far as the savings go with band -aids ( - =An Ironclad rep told me that the newer glove models have improved stitching quality. I am going to order another pair to see if I can note the improvements."
3,comfortable,"Nice glove. I have owned them for a year now and give them a workout building small sheds and other construction projects. Very nice for fingering nails or other fine work. Threading is starting to pull away on some of the pads, but still a good glove with a lot of life left in them. I will never go back to ""heavy leather"" type gloves again."
3,Good book for beginners,"While the techniques in the book are mainly for the beginner, her recipies will give even advanced winemakers some new things to try.Not written as a dry text, but full of her amusing experiences making many of the recipies in the book.A great place to start, but once you get going, you may want to refer to other books that go into additional detail about yeast selection, using yeast starters and champagne production"
2,Not a Grape Wine Book,"Only reason I am giving two stars is i bought this on the premise i was going to learn about making wine with grapes which is popular in the New York/Ontario area where i live. The author is more in love with wine from fruit. I have to admit it intriqued me, but, I think the title should be Making Fruit wine or something like it. Out side of that good book on basic wine making tips, I learned alot, just not about making wine from grapes.This is more of a book for apple wine or berry wine, than forMerlot or Cabernet..."
4,Nice intro to winemaking,"This book does a good job at giving basic techniques and recipes for making fruit wines. Don't use there mead recipe though. Also, they mention boiling the corks to serilize then which is a no-no that will give you crumbly corks."
3,IT WAS A USEFUL BOOK,"It is a book which my husband finds useful, he is experimenting with winemaking. The cover looked good on line but it looked like a used book and that was disappointing. I received a partial refund and so I will shop again. Thank you."
2,Not for serious winemakers,"This book is entertaining and filled with a lot of useful recipes if you don't particularly care about what the final product tastes like--that is, if you aren't interested in trying to make a reasonably serious wine. If making something possibly drinkable out of a variety of fruits and vegetables interests you, this will be useful. If you want to make what most people think of as ""wine"" (i.e., fermented grape juice) the book is not of much interest."
5,Great book for getting started,This is the second copy of this book I have purchased. This one is to replace a copy I gave away to a friend who wanted to start making homemade wine. I have about 20 books on the subject matter and this was the first one I reached for. I consider this my best resource and find myself going back to it over and over. It also has some great recipes.
5,"Average level, fun for trying your own winemaking","I have to admit that I stood at the book store for a long time looking over a small selection of books for winemaking. If you are looking for a book that deals just with grape wines, put this back on the shelf. But for me I fell in love. I flip through the start and then check out the back index, references, and everything else in the appendix. It has the conversions (metric, and general volumes which makes it easy to know how many cups are in a pound) The index has by subject, recipe, and ingredients.The recipes are fun which makes it all the more exciting to finally find out how your wine will taste after those 6 months. I started to read this book a couple days ago and it is already bookmarked by information and recipes I want to try.The chapter with info on the hydrometer is so much less complex than other papers I have read.You can't have just one winemaking book, that would be unwise. Add this one to your collection."
4,A good book to add to wine making,"I got this book to see, what additional information on wine making it had. It was very affordable and is a useful book."
4,good little book,I found this book very helpful for just getting started. The instructions and recipes are all very easy. I've made three of the recipes and all are in the process of aging. The color of the wine is good and it smelled and tasted pretty good before I bottled it to age. Can't wait to see what it tastes like in November.
5,Team Player book,"A must-have, must-read for every coach (youth to pro) and every parent of an athlete! After over 30 years of coaching volleyball (boys & girls) at the college, high school and Jr. Olympic levels, I wish I had read this book, earlier in my career!"
1,the worst ever,"Fellow readers,I have heard of Harry Sheehy and the wonderful school of Williams, and I honestly must say that I could not have been more disappointed after I purchased this book. I was expecting a tale of inspiration, but what I got was an egotistical and extremely monotonous story that looked as if it was written by a third grader. I must be honest to you guys; I would definitely not recommend buying this book.Concerned Reader"
1,Buyer Beware. I got the teachers edition instead of student.,I received the teacher edition and need the student edition. And I don't have time to return it for the correct one. I paid $12 for a $70 book. Great price. Wrong book.
4,great start,great kit for first time air tool user. good power & excellent guns. compressor is a tad loud.
4,light and reasonably reliable,"I do general remodeling and have had this combo for a year or two. First and foremost: it's really light (and yes, it's noisy). When I'm working on second, third and fourth floors, I'm very pleased I bought it. Contrary to popular opinion, it will run a framing gun. Now let me qualify that: if you're framing a large project and expect this compressor to do the job, forget it. However, for small jobs when you don't mind the thing cycling after 7 or 8 nails, it works as well as one can expect (for a relatively tiny compressor). For use with the finish gun, the brad gun, or crown stapler it works just fine. I've found the PC air guns to be decent for sporadic use. That is, if you're using them to put in a couple of pieces of trim or some such, they do the job well. If you're doing large-scale or production jobs all day long you may want to go with the Hitachi guns."
4,Excellent first set,"I've had my nailer set for about 9 months now, and it continues to work excellently. Other than the compressor being a bit noisy in a closed garage, the guns and compressor work wonderfully.I have used the nailers for a variety of projects, mostly cabinet and furniture building, and continue to be impressed by their good working quality. The stapler isn't able to take longer staples, but then I have mostly used mine to attach back panels to cabinets, and it works fine other than it tends to over drive staples at times.One interesting thing - I've probably plowed through several boxes of nails and haven't had any issues with jamming. I've been pretty careful about cleaning my guns after use, and oiling them before hand, which probably has helped.My next purchase will be to spring for a better air hose - the one which comes with the kit is ok, but is fairly rigid. Still, it has held up good and if I didn't mind it rolling up a bit messy, would go on for another year or so safely."
5,great sound quality,"i've tried them all with my great Grado headphone, and i find that panasonic has the purest sound out of all the portable cd."
2,The free car adapter offer has expired,"Tho' on the package it says free car adapter, the coupon must be mailed before May 31, 1999, so forget it. I have a call in to Panasonic. Pain. Would have given more stars but for that!!!"
1,Garbage,"I obught this cd player thinking it would live up to the hype. and the money, but after a week, panasonic's little niches began to occur. it started stopping my cd's and would jerk around. not playing. i thought this is garbage."
1,Misleading Battery Info,"One reason I bought this CD was because of the rechareable battery feature. What they don't tell you is in plain English is that you need special Ni-Cd batteries. It took me four stores and $20 dollors later to find them. I bought the Radio Shack brand. I put them in and naturally, they don't work. After a call to Panasonic, I find out you have to use only Panasonic brand Ni-CD batteries which are available in about 10 stores nationwide. You have to order them through Panasonic for an additional $13. Buy another brand that is designed with the consumer in mind and parts that are widely available."
3,Pretty Good Sound but Not So Good Belt,"Although the sound from this player is very good, the sport belt is really poor quality. I have used it only five or six times, and already the belt is beginning to tear. It also doesn't stay tight when you are using it, so I have to stop two or three times during my run to re-tighten it. As far as the anti-skipping protection, I have found that it skips about three or four times during my run, and I'm not a very hard runner. Overall, I'd say its just ok. I really thought it would skip a lot less than it does."
5,AWESOME!,"Well, I know I did good on this buy. As soon as I got it out of the box i started testing it. First I tried shaking it. Then I hopped with it in my hands. After that i jumped down the stairs then finally i Jumped on my trampoline and did a back flip. And get this not ONCE did it skip. The only problems with this is that the headphones are not very good. Also, you must double check to make sure that that the headphones are plugged in ALL the way or else it will sound like the music is underwater. Over all this is a great product and I definatally reccomend that you get it."
1,poorly made,"Used to cut ceiling sheetrock, creates alot of dust, not a clean cut. Spend the extra money and get a fixed non adjustable circular hole blade"
1,Not even close!,"This tool is a complete waste of time and money.In short it's a real piece of crap! I only wish I had read other reviews before buying it. As suggested by another reviewer, spend the money and buy the Hole Pro. Amazon sells them and a number of models are available. They cost more, but you can do the job right, without the aggravation and mess."
2,EXTREMELY light duty,"If you cut holes all the time or work in the install business then this is not for you. If you need something like this then bust out your wallet and get the Hole Pro X-305 Kit 1-7/8"" to 12""."
4,This is Winger? You gotta be kidding me... Right?,"OK, I'll come out and say it right now. I HATE hair rock. I used to make fun of ""Headed For A Heartbreak"" because, to me, it sounded like a pre-packaged, ready-for-mass-consumption product. In retrospect, I feel I was right. Hair rock had nothing musical or satisfying to offer. This album is NOT hair rock. Actually, I'm really surprised at how much I enjoy the musicianship, the writing and the vision behind this work. Think of the better aspects of Toto merged with progressive rock. Good songs, good flow, good performance, good statement. Way to go Kip. You're all grown up!"
5,Amazing....truly amazing,"I've been a Winger fan for years, and still enjoy their music however Kip's 'deeper direction' in his approach to songwriting as opposed to 'chunking' is so evident here. This cd is an import in Canada, (too bad!!). This cd proves that he endured the 'glam' era only to come out stronger than ever in what I think is his best material yet......personal fav's? Endless Circles, Naked Son, Kiss of life, Angel of the underground....really...this entire cd is worth checking out..... (ps) Great musicianship, Rod Morgenstein's drumming is bang on for this style of music!.."
1,Never shipped!,"Perfect just what I was looking for. Then I got a note that it would be delayed, then another, then another. After several months I just gave up and canceled."
4,Entertaining and educational tour-de-force in chemistry,"Its one of those anecdotical and thought provocking essays on the subject of chemistry.. while telling the story, you actually learn something and not necessarily in chemistry, this is what makes the book so interesting.If you are like me, not crazy to be a chemist wiz, but like to have functinal knowledge of what materials and compunds affect you everyday, then this is the book. Also it serves as stepping stones or lateral-thought provocations that will make you have other points of view open."
5,great book,I had to get this book for class and it was in great shape for not alot of money! I got it just in time for class and it arrived in good shape. Thank you for the book
4,"Contains a less aggressive sound than ""The Devil You Know""","Econoline Crush is one of the few rock/alternative bands I keep up with. In the past they have delivered a unique and refreshing sound, such as the fast and aggressive style with slightly distorted lyrics found on their previous release, ""The Devil You Know"". Unfortunately, part of that style has been lost on ""Brand New History"". The overall tone of this album is much more laid back and slower than before, and that will no doubt be a disappointment to some. Once you get past that however, you'll find that there are some fairly enjoyable tracks on ""Brand New History"". Songs like ""Flamethrower"", ""You Don't Know What It's Like"", and ""Tomorrow Starts Today"" all live up to the quality one would expect from Econoline Crush, and will easily become stuck in your head long after you listen to them. I still believe ""The Devil You Know"" is by far their best album, but ""Brand New History"" is certainly worth attention."
1,Such a let down,"Seriously? Dating myself here, the first concert I ever went to was an Econoline Crush/God Lives Underwater/Stabbing Westward show and its was amazing. Econoline was touring on the Devil You Know which was awesome.Don't bother with this pile. Terrible follow up...Canadians."
3,Good and Bad,"This CD collects the two sides of early Jerry Jeff Walker, Walker with the group Circus Maximus, and his first solo release.The music from Circus Maximus is uneven at best and much of it has not aged well. The only memorable song from Circus Maximus was ""The Wind"" but that was not a Jerry Jeff song and it is not included here. What is included is, quite frankly, pretty bad.The great stuff is from his only solo Vanguard Album, ""Drifting Way of Life"". Instead of purchasing this collection, you are better off owning ""Drifting Way of Life""."
2,A real disappointment.,"I was surprised and disappointed with this over-priced CD. Not only is the album devoid of the Texas flavor I had come to know and love, but it seems to be a mish-mash of disparate melodies. Perhaps the die-hard fan will be happy with this album just because it completes the collection. But anyone purchasing it for listening enjoyment will likely be let down."
4,Good fun for grandson's,I purchased it for my grandsons who are into rugrats! They enjoyed it and learned a few songs from it.
3,A gift,I don't yet know how the person I bought it for will like it. Will review later. Will let you know
2,disapointing,"I enjoyed the opening of this book very much, but most of it's suggestions to develop a ""professional sound"" require 4 note chords with greater than an octave reach, with no alternatives for those of us with smaller hands."
4,ONE OF HER BEST,"I REMEMBER HAVING THIS ALBUM ON LP BACK IN THE 1970'S. I AM GLAD I HAVE IT ON CD NOW, IT IS A BLAST FROM THE PAST. FLORA PURIM IS AN ACQUIRED TASTE. SHE HAS A FIVE OCTAVE RANGE, AND IMPROVISES A LOT IN HER SINGING. WITH SOME OF THE OTHER MUSICINS ON THIS RELEASE, (HER HUSBAND), AIRTO MOREIRA, RON CARTER ON BASS, MILTON NASCIMENTO (ANOTHER BRAZILIAN NATIONAL TRASUE), THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS PUT OUT BY FLORA PURIM FROM THAT TIME. WE USED TO CALL THIS STUFF JAZZ FUSION MUSIC, AND THIS HAS A LATIN TINGE TO IT AS WELL."
5,Buy 'O Cantador' and maybe Uri (The Wind); leave the rest,"Butterfly Dreams is by a far a superior CD to this.'O Cantador', however, is among the greatest recordings that Flora (or Airto, Ron Carter, etc) has ever made (equal to the original Return to Forever cuts, in my opinion).'O Cantador' rates a 10 stars (out of 10)Uri rates a 5 and everything else on this CD is 4 or less."
1,Waste,"Do,nt buy do,s nothing for noise.waste of money just make sure you have good grounds that's better and well help."
2,noise suppressor,"The component inside was loose, it rattled, took it out of the case and used just the electronic component, that worked fine."
5,Excellent Results on AM Radio,"I installed the LN71 noise suppressor in my 2004 Hyundai Sonata and have huge improvement in the AM radio reception. I like talk radio stations and had really been disappointed with the AM reception in my Hyundai. I installed this noise supressor in line on the the constant 12v power lead (orange wire) coming into the harness and connected the black ground wire to the metal chassis under my dash. It made a huge difference in reception on 860 hz and up. I still get some alternator noise on a 540 hz station that is pretty far away, but can still hear speech well enough to understand (before that station was much worse). This unit is made for 900 hz - 6000 hz. The wires are a bit short so I soldered about 8"" extra length on each of them to make it easier to install."
4,Elvis is dead and I don't feel so good myself,Classic Lewis Grizzard. It would be great to hear his recorded voice again reading his own work. He could be very cynical but extremely funny.
1,For people who find Larry the Cable Guy too intellectual.,"This book seems to have been written for people who miss the good ol' days when men were men and there weren't none of them laws about smackin' your wife when she spoke out of turn or having to wait until your daughter was 16 before you could have sex with her.But it's kind of funny in a campy sort of way. It's not meant to be offensive and it's hard to be offended by his pathetic attempts at humor. It's a bit like what Rush Limbaugh's show would be like if there were a laugh track after every sentence, so his satire of defiantly-ignorant right-wing mouthbreathers wouldn't accidentally be taken seriously."
3,"Incorrect info on amazon site, but good show","This was a funny video, and I'm glad I watched it. I bought it due to the Amazon site listing Joanna Gleason as the director. The problem is that her name is no where in any of the credits. Someone else is listed as the director. So, if you're a Joanna Gleason fan (rare, I know), kindly move along. But, for anyone who likes a good stand up routine, this is a fine video."
3,"Louie's 1988 standup act, NOT his 1996 TV series","The Amazon listing contains cast and crew information referring to Louie Anderson's 1996 TV series, which is what I assumed I was getting. It is actually a recording of his standup comedy act from 1988, NOT his 1996 TV show. Still funny, but not what the listing information implied."
2,"Fantastic, but watch the binding!","My 2 and 6 year olds love this bible. They spend time memorizing the rhymes and looking at the gorgeous illustrations. However, I am planning on calling the publishers this week and asking for another copy. We've had it for 6 months and the binding is shot! The cover is separating from the rest of the book. Such a bummer. Hope they replace it for me..."
1,Was the Pharoh a Jerk?,"I saw this Bible at a bookstore while on a road trip and grabbed it. I was excited about the phonics part. I didn't like the rhyming part in this Bible because it left the writer calling the pharoh ""a jerk"" just to have a word that rhymed. There was another instance of name calling as well. I didn't want a Bible reader that would leave my child in the bad habit of name-calling. These were not stories that I wanted to read over and over to my son.I returned this Bible to the store and hope to find another Bible reader that has an emphasis on phonics.Good Rhyming Bibles that I'd recommend are ""The Rhyme Bible for Toddlers"" and ""The Rhyme Bible"" both by L.J. Sattgast and published by ZonderKidz (both available here at Amazon)."
2,Does not have a hardcopy of book,On the cover of this CD it states that it contains the full text. I thought this meant that a hardcopy of the book was inside. This does not contain a hardcopy.. it is just for listening to.
1,don't let this product deceive you,"On November 1st of last year, I knew exactly what I wanted to be: an infant baby Elvis. The problem was that I had no idea how I was going to pull it off. That is until I found the Unique Infant Baby Elvis Costume on amazon. When I found it, I was so overcome with joy, I nearly started to weep. However my tears turned to anger immediately when I received the costume. Buyer beware: this is not an infant baby costume for adults, it is an infant baby costume for BABIES. 12-18 months is the intended age for the wearer of the costume, not how old the costume is.Where's the fine print Unique Infant Baby Elvis Costume, 12-18 Months maker?"
2,Fails to focus on the 45 days after Lincoln's death,"A good read, but not fantastic. I think more should be documented about Johnson than actually is, but this is not some long-awaited book on it like I had hoped. Means writes a lot about Johnson's background, which is important, but he really fails to focus in on ""the 45 days"" following Lincoln's assassination. He does do a great job, though, of painting the pre-impeachment scene, when there was quite a bit of optimism and harmony about Johnson, even in the wake of the fallen Lincoln. It's worth the quick read, but beware of intermittant, oddly-placed, and unnecessary ""plunk job"" references to modern times (such as Nixon or even the Iraq war). Would have received 3 stars except it failed its own title about the 45 days."
2,Not Good Enough,"I was looking forward to reading this book as I wanted to expand my knowledge of Andrew Johnson and the period immediately after Lincoln's death. Unfortunately this book is neither successful popular nor serious history. It is not particularly well-written and the author lacks the authority or gravitas to make his judgments seem trustworthy. If time is our most valuable commodity, then save yourself a little and read something else on this period."
4,The transition from Lincoln to Johnson.,"Andrew Johnson was one of our worst Presidents. In this book, author Means relates the personality of Andy Johnson, and his failings in the leadership role. Johnson was the aftermath of the great Presidency of Abraham Lincoln. To be judged according to what Lincoln did was a gave injustice to Johnson. However, Johnson's personality was not suited to a leadership role in such a viotile time. Johnson was personally brave, and was a thoughtful man. However, once he took a position, he never changed or compromised. This made him an unsuccessful leader in a time when the nation was changing so much. His moderate policies pleased no one, least of all his former enemies.This is a nice read about a transition time in American history. There have been many, but this one was probably the foremost time when a personality did not take charge and shape the destiny of the country."
1,STOPPED WORKING!,"I agree with the previous review that if you have pets SKIP this machine. The warranty is for one year and wouldn't you know it, it died after exactly 1 year and 1 month. I have 2 dogs and this thing was never good at picking up the pet hair either."
1,great for body builders and people who love to get dirty!,"You will love this vaccuum if:1. you love to lift heavy objects and drag them around the house while they insist on falling over.2. you love to create a bigger mess than when you started by dumping the dust bin and watching fine, particulate dust cover your body and the vaccuum....I don't get it...why on God's green earth would anyone want this piece of cr*p?"
3,Great Vacuum - Never got from Amazon,"I ordered this from Amazon the beginning of November. The first one was lost around thanksgiving. They sent a second that had an estimated delivery date of after Christmas, so I purchased one from a local store on sale at a cheaper price.Now I have returned the one sent, but no refund! WTF!?!"
1,Worst vacuum I've ever owned.,"After a year, the vacuum started to overheat. Now, it will run for about 45 seconds before overheating and shutting down. I have to wait a good half hour before it will turn on again. The design is awkward and the vacuum is heavy and when it is working, it often spits dirt back onto the floor. Do not buy this vacuum if you want something that even works."
2,It Sucks!!!!,"I had the vacuum for a month before the brush stopped working. The lift-off function works well, but when I use it in up-right mode it doesn't work well...the suction vanishes. The filters are great, however the machine requires a lot of up-keep...they need to be cleaned with every other use."
5,Bissell Vacuum Cleaner,"I was a little apprehensive after reading previous reviews. I must say, the suction on the vacuum is great and it seems to be working fine. I would recommend this vacuum."
2,cord problem,I have had this vacuum for quite awhile and at first loved it ... 2 cats and 2 rabbits the vacuum did well with the pet hair BUT the cord started to split apart ..... my friend has the same problem with hers .... just getting by with it the other day a spark flew out of the cord and I had a small fire in my rug !!!! To the trash with it !!!
3,Be prepared to replace the roller brush repeatedly,"I've had this vacuum cleaner for at least six years and most of it works well. However, I've replaced the roller brush assembly repeatedly. I've lost count how many times, actually. Apparently the ball bearings in that part freeze up after about 6 months. I googled this problem and apparently others have had trouble, too. The part runs about $20 every time. I'm pretty tired of replacing the part. It just happened again today and I've only got half my vacuuming done."
2,Second and last Bissell,"I loved the lift off section with accessories, but true to form the plastic foot kick that hold the unit upright when you stop vacuuming broke off within the first three months. And once again, you cannot get a replacement part for it. This is my final Bissell. If they can't make good parts at least they can provide replacement parts. If they can't do either, forget it."
1,Terrible Filter Design,"I have owned this vacuum for a few years and have grown to like the theory but hate the execution. The lift off aspect is very convenient for tight places, cars, etc. The suction is quite powerful. Those are the good aspects.The bad part is the filter design. Simply put, to keep this vacuum operating properly the dust cup must be constantly emptied. Don't be fooled by the full line on the dust cup. By the time it becomes that full all the filters will be clogged beyond recognition with dirt. To make matters worse, cleaning these filters is time consuming at best. The unit also likes to blow dust out of the back and from other areas, regardless of how full the dust cup is and how dirty or clean the filters are. This unit has a poorly designed filter that only works (and even then not all that well) when the dust cup is empty and all the filters are clean.Don't make the mistake of buying this unit. There are much better vacuums on the market."
2,Pet Owner,"This vacuum is way too heavy - we have a tri-level house and I am sick of carrying it up and down the stairs. I also find it dirty - hate the bagless option. We have to frequently wash the little spongy filter which is a dusty, dirty job. The turbo brush tool doesn't seem to work well. It does a decent, but not great, job on picking up dog hair. I had a Panasonic before this that ran forever (about 15 years with minor maintenance) and was much lighter. I just ordered myself another Panasonic. I would not recommend the Bissell to anyone."
4,Bissell vacuum,"Ilike my new vacuum a lot. I am still learning how to use it. The only problem I have is the knob that raises & lowers for rugs or bare floors is almost impossible to turn. I don't know if there is a trick or not to turning this knob, but if there is please let me know. Otherwise, ease of use and suction power is wonderful."
2,What's great about it lead to its demise,My wife got this over two years ago and until this week it was the best vacuum we have owned. We have dogs and hardwood floors and it was amazing how much stuff it picked up. The detachable canister made it great for on-the-fly under the couch cleaning and hitting the stairs. Ultimately the liftoff part of this vacuum caused a short.It appears you need to be careful over time when putting the canister back on the base. If the two are not connected perfectly or things get tweaked over time it leads to the wispy electrical smoke that we got this week. Most likely it was our own carelessness that caused this but it is still upsetting that after two years we have to purchase another vacuum. The connectors are now charred black and the wife has already purchased a new vacuum on Amazon. Never again will we get a liftoff.
1,Will never buy bagless again!,"Bought this vacuum about three years ago. I absolutely hate it! Emptying the canister is disgusting and having to handle those supposed filter and scrape off all the dust is even more so disgusting. Also, this vacuum sucks in that it doesn't suck at all. I have to run over the same piece of carpet over and over to get it to pick up clearly visible dust, crumbs, whatever.Today I just bought a new Miele canister vacuum as I think three years gone by justifies me being able to finally kick this thing to the curb (which I have wanted to do from the start)."
3,great but too heavy,"I bought this based on reviews. I needed an upgrade with a baby on the way. It definitely picks up EVERYTHING which is great and I love all the filters... I assume they do what they are meant to. It's just VERY heavy, nearly 30lbs (and I have 3 floors). I didn't see anyone write this in the reviews and didn't happen to notice the weight in the product description. It's pretty loud too which makes me nervous about using it while baby is sleeping. Guess we'll see how that goes. If you don't mind heavy and loud then I would give it 5 stars."
3,You might want to pay more...,"This is an ok vaccuum. At the time, I did not want to spend a lot of money and this was in my price range. The revolving attachment was great until it broke from normal usage. I have pets and I really liked the way that it picked up the hair. Also, the part that holds the vaccuum to upright while not in use broke as well. You have to understand, I am not rough on my products. I hhave had this vaccuum for almost 2 years now and it still looks brand new. The overall suction of the vaccuum is good for the money. If you have the money, step it up and buy something that is more durable. Probably hard to find since everything is plastic anymore!"
2,not good at getting dog hair,We bought this vacuum about a year and a half ago. We have two dogs and this doesn't pick up the dog hair very well at all. I will never buy a bagless vacuum again and definitely wouldn't recommend this vacuum to anyone.
2,Loses power rapidly,"I was amazed at how quickly this vacuum cleaner loses suction power. I have to fully clean it (empty the canister and clean the filters) after every use. However, if I do that, it does an acceptable cleaning job."
4,excellent carpet cleaner,"I used a Dirt Devil cannister for the longest time - i like its mobility for stairs and getting behind things, however, the extensions finally broke and left me on my knees to vacuum floors. Not fun. And belittling.This Lift-off Bissell operates mainly as an upright, but what attracted me was its cannister-like conversion thru its lift off feature. It cleans exceptionally well as an upright, but is still plagued by long hair getting wound up around the brushes and needs to be cut out from time to time. Also the hand-held turbo brush operates off the vacuum suction and cleans pet hair off couches very well, but doesn't clean blinds very well. I'll have to clean those by other means. I don't like the ""Extra Wide"" brushes because they stick out 1/2 inch to each side at the front, often getting hung up on furntiture legs and such. I've only had the chance to use it 4 times so far, but i can now be less squeemish about having to vacuum the floors...on my knees."
3,Worked great until it died at 2 years old,This vaccum cleaner worked great until it died with no explanation yesterday. It was only 2 years old.
3,Misleading size description,"I purchased this for my great dane puppy who is growing like a weed. I ordered the same collar in two other sizes for my adult boxers and both were extremely tight, despite the fact that I bought the same sizes that I always do. This made me suspicious, so I measured all three. The nylon on this collar is only 26"" long with the longest hole at 23 1/4 inches. The collar itself is very nice and since I bought it a little large for him to grow into, I will be keeping it. I hope this is helpful."
2,Nothing I don't know about already.,"This book was not helpful at all to me. I basically have a good working knowledge about fibromyalgia and this book offered no new helpful advice; in fact, it seems to be very outdated. The author basically speaks about her own actual experience. I would try another book rather than this one, probably a book written in 2005."
1,Never Ready,"Don't buy these batteries, because they don't last long like Energizer or Duracell. These Eveready batteries ain't never ready."
1,LA NOVELA NO VIENE COMPLETA...,"si estan buscando la novela completa Llena de Amor, esta NO ES... ESTA CORTADA LOS CAPITULOS!!! es como un resumen.... y ellos no ponen ahi la información completa de que está cortada!"
4,I'm going to read more Perry Mason now!,"This is Perry Mason as you've never watched him. The beauty of these mysteries is that you get to follow along as Perry Mason unravels the mystery. This is in stark contrast to the television show, where the unraveling was done in the courtroom and seemed to demand omniscience of Mr. Mason. In this book, which is actually three mysteries in one package, you can actually see whodunit if you're astute and pay careful attention. I was only able to guess one of them right but boy did I feel good about it."
2,I had never seen so many mistakes in a single book,"I bought this book because of the chapter talking about Voyager. However, reading the book from cover to cover, I found many mistakes:- classes extending interface (instead of implementing) see pages 42, 168, 379- methods without return value; see pages 43, 62- code with compiler errors; see page 121- utilization of non-existing classes (see page 180: Invite)- Instantiation of abstract class (see page 200)- Unfinished code (see page 203, catch without type)- declaration of throws exception when those exceptions are never thrown (page 239)- error in the program logic (see page 285, where anExtension.actions should be used instead of anExtension.bundles)- strings not closed (see page 381).I reported these problems to the author and received no response. So, if you want to buy this book, forget about the code, because it won't compile..."
3,a really nice introduction,"Looks like a really nice introduction to the area! I'm glad we have a good book like this. Nice to see ""Sea of Objects"" end up in print, too :-)"
3,Totally outstanding,"I purchased your book ""Progr. Mobile Objects with Java"" and find it totally outstanding. I like it so much that I borrowed your Chapter 8, ""Building a Dynamic Upgradable Text Editor"" for my Software Engineering class term project at DePaul Univ.)"
2,"first half ***, second half * (at best)","Buy it only if you want the overview in the first half. The ""design patterns"" second half is dreadful and the sample code hasn't even been formatted. The author's Java credentials are somewhat undermined by his belief that class definitions are terminated by semi-colons."
3,DARPA uses mobile objects,"Hey - I'm reading your book! I'm working on a small DARPA research project in which we want to demonstrate that mobile objects will work between disparate projects with a little work.(I dindn't know that they were called mobile objects, but it seems like a good name) . I'm just getting started with the book, but it seems to cover pretty much what we need."
2,Is hardly worth the money...,"Somebody below me said the book is a great introductory book as far as the future of Java is concerned.This book is indeed an introduction. But, if you REALLY want an introductory book, you should go for other books from Wiley - a book written by Orfali, for example. They're a magnitude better than this one.I'v read Orfali's most books and am pretty happy with them - his Distributed Objects Survival Guide is the best intro book on CORBA I've ever read. Also, Peter van den Linden's Not just Java is also a good introductory book to most topics covered in Nelson's book - except for the vendor-specific subjects, of course - voyagee (sp?) et al. But they only take up some 70-80 pages. The other 530-540 pages are just plain bad - just compare this book to those of Orfali...Do NOT buy this book."
5,Storyline ....,"...Here's the description from the cover to help you decide if this book is for you: ""She danced to the music of magic, danger, and love ... Glennys had come to the dazzling city of St. Lucien to seek her fortune. No longer under the protection of Baron Fulk, unable to return to her strict Alaminite folk, she soon found work as a Horse Skiller with the Queen's Opera. But her Heart's true desire is to appear with the Opera ... performing onstage in the intricate and demanding horse-dance. And Glynnys has the gift that could make her the greatest of all dancers. But to reveal her gift is to expose her true identity, for only one of the noble blood has the power. And amid the courtly intrigues of St. Lucien, to claim her birthright could put Glennys is gravest peril ..."" This book is a mix of fantasy and suspense. Excellent read."
2,Chips easily,"Chips! I bought this set as a gift for my husband last Christmas. He used them about once a month. We hand washed and treated with great care, yet both glasses developed chips on the rim after 11 months of very light use. They are beautiful glasses, and we were planning on getting more this Christmas but since they seemed to need greater care than we could provide, and too expensive to last such a short time, we are now using and expanding our set of the excellent and well priced Glen Cairn whiskey glasses."
5,Makes a huge difference over regular glasses,"If you enjoy a good scotch, this will only elevate your tastings. This really lets you take in all the nuances of your scotch, and it does what it says it does. A wonderful product to do scotch tastings."
3,Slow Shipping,"People have complained that this says nothing about the glassware. I spoke with my dad and the glass is not his favorite for scotch but he thinks it looks nice and rates it a 4 star out of personal preference. Now I am taking away a star based on slow delivery and that is specific for the seller. I will keep the original thoughts as follows : ""The glassware arrived safely but the package arrived two days after it was promised. All I can suspect is that they forgot about the order since it arrived by Fedex instead of the postal service per my order. It was part of my fathers birthday gift and I was disappointed that this didnt arrive one time as indicated by the ""latest"" deliver by date."""
5,Wonderful Enhancement,"On a recent stay at the Westin Kierland Resort in Scottsdale, I took part in a single malt scotch tasting sponsored by their Food and Beverage Department. The beverage director used glasses of this shape and size, and talked about how the shape of the glass can enhance the single malt experience. I was initially skeptical, but as soon as the tasting began I was convinced, and started looking to purchase a few for myself as soon as I returned home. I only rarely drink single malt scotch (too expensive) but I've found my enjoyment of those rare moments increased by 100% as a result of these glasses. They are pricey, but a wonderful way to help you enjoy your favorite single malt scotch, and I recommend them highly. Plus Amazon's prices were the best I could find when I purchased them."
4,A solid piece for DM...,"I have enjoyed every album since Violator, and this is no exception. It is fairly different from Ultra and SoF'nD, a bit brighter in tone, but is still resonates with DM gloom at times. During a stretch of artists like Britney and NSynch, it is nice to get a quality ""old-school"" band to come out with a truly good album. I can't wait for July when I get to see them do this live!"
1,"Great song, lousy remixes - Very disappointing","""Dream On"" has so much potential for a decent remix. The vocals, the guitar, the bass. Instead what we get are some really boring drum beats with cliche processed loops of the song. Sounds like something I would hear in a club with mediocre DJ. Too bad, since so much could be done with this song."
1,I guess I'm not in the majority,"After reading so many 5 star reviews, and not hearing the single on the radio, I had a fairly high level of anticipation regarding this single. I was VERY let down. It's not that it's bad, it's just ""there"". I've been a big fan since ""Speak & Spell"" and thought Ultra was a wonderful CD from begining to end. While I have no issue with the acoustic guitars (I loved the acoutstic version of ""Personal Jesus""), this just seems boring. If I heard this and they said it was any other band, I'd turn the station. As it is, I now have severe doubts about the new CD, Exciter. Also, the ""B""side, ""Easy Tiger"". . what's up with that? Wah-wah guitars? Again, not horrible, not experimental, just kind of ""7th grade, let's start a band"" kind of a sound. I'm hoping ""Dream On"" will grow on me, but I had to pull it off after one play. Sorry guys, as I really am a fan."
1,"BORING, TEDIOUS AND BLAND","DREAM ON is so bland sounding. Try listening to the song after PERSONAL JESUS and you'll see what I'm talking about. There's not much of a melody and no depth to the song. It's very light and underproduced like most of EXCITER. Oh well, we'll have to wait another four years before they manage to release another album."
1,Where's Depeche Mode,This is not Depeche Mode. It's a trick. Some other band has released a terrible song and somehow gotten permission to use Depeche Mode's name. Depeche Mode would never release something this bad. Even at their worst they didn't sound like this. I hope they get a clue and get back on track or this could be the beginning of the end of their career.
5,popcorn,my son loves it it was a special purchase for him he will use it at camp this year he is a camp counseler and needed it for his job
5,Great whistle,My son is VERY happy with this whistle. He bought his first whistle at Dick's Sporting Goods but he didn't like so I got him this brand (after read an article about drum major) as this year he was picked as a drum major at his school and he's been happy since.
2,some repeats,"I like the Joe Wheeler books, but am beginning to see far too many repeated stories in them!"
3,"Too hard, Too little Diagrams","If you want to over prepare for the SATs, Kaplan is the way to go. But for a quick cramming section, you probably should stay away from this. The authors of this review book seem to enjoy using words to explain complex concepts rather than using graphs and diagrams. Even people who scored in the upper 700s on the actually test found this review an overkill."
3,Interesting but Nahhh.......,"Well the beats are heavily raw on this one.. From the get-go u get bumpy instrumentals that are more thicker than a BK Milkshake...Gore keeps the delivery dapper with his raspy Mexican/Italian drawl. ""Born of Fire"" was my favorite cut in this album, in where the Necro beat flows fluid (though we all getting a lil tired of the same ol type sound after 5 other releases by the same producer) and Gore does his thang. Lyrically, he doesn't nor does any other of the goons pack punch like Ill Bill and Necro... Honestly, they just don't contain the charisma and addictive flow talent like the 2 dimented characters mentioned b4. But, nothing wrong with wanting to drop your own LP and observing how it does out there... Umm, it's a solid album,,,,,BUT it sure ain't anything impressive.. Just your avg. CD for these avg. days......"
1,can you say studio punch in?,"Don't listen to the fake 5-star reviews for this disaster of an album. Goretex uses studio punch-ins for every single line and has no breath control. Worse yet, most songs are about 2 minutes long and the rest are skits that aren't amusing or original. Goretex rode the success of Ill Bill's expert emceeing on the Non-Phixion albums, but his weakness as an artist shows on this fetid solo attempt. People who gave this tripe a good review are just fanatic losers in their mom's basements who love every Psycho-Logical album released. But anyone with an IQ above 70 or even a modest degree of taste in underground hip hop should run, FAST, from this worthless excuse for a doorstop."
4,its over with?,"the album is really good, but something lacks to be a classic.an album for the fans, all the tracks are good, the beats are good. the album is a little to short, but you will listen to it alot."
2,A disappointment...,"I bought this album with high expectations as I've enjoyed GOretex's contributions to Non-Phixion and his solo work elsewhere. But frankly, this album sucks.There are maybe 2 decent songs on here (The Art of Dying and Extreme Makeover), while the rest is instantly forgettable. NEcro did a great job producing Ill Bill's album but I guess Bill got all the good tracks because the production here is lacking. As for Goretex, it sounded like he phoned his rhymes in as none of his verses stood out to me.I just don't think there's much here to warrant a purchase unless you're a hardocre Non-Phixion fan and need to complete the set."
2,its okay,"I have stated before in my other reviews that Goretexx isn't my favorite member of Non Phixion but I decided to check his CD out anyways and I have to say, I was right when I said he was garbadge.Why? Well a majority of his lyrics come off as just uninspired and immature. Lets see, how to describe Gortexx... um... a less lyrical version of Necro comes to mind.So to the consumer, if you purchase this cd consider the fact that the whole album is basicly Goretexx trying to be vulgar to the point it comes off as tasteless, cliche, and phoney. If you don't mind, and want to hear a few good beats and some tight guest appearances, then go ahead and cop it."
1,I'll be returning it,"I had a lot of optimism for this because my girlfriend has aGriffin FM transmitter for her ipod and it works great. I liked the awesome display and that it could operate on batteries. The only problem is that it doesn't work. I tried it in both of my cars (a truck and a car) and I held it all over the interior of both cars trying to find the ""sweet spot"" but I couldn't. I also tried going up the whole FM frequency and couldn't find anything that would work. In frustration I picked up the Sony cassette adapter and it works perfectly and sounds great. Oh well."
1,Don't buy it,"The range of this product is very very short. The radio frecuency it's clear if I stand in front of the antena, but inside the car, I hear a lot of noise and the volume it's low."
2,Reception problem,"Transmitter is no improvement over the Belkin Tunecast 2. The stereo option is a nice idea, but it is not strong enough to provide a clear stereo signal. I also own the Tunecast 2 and it has a stronger mono signal then the Tunecast 3 in mono mode. So, I would avoid buying this product."
1,try to find a better option,"the quality of the audio sucks, while you're driving the sounds fades awfully, and even when your car is parked you have to keep low the volume because of the distorting audio."
3,Belkin F8M010,"They have dumped a lot of transmission power out of these. If you are not close, try to find an older one of the same model. Outherwisw it functions great."
1,Trash!,It only gets 1 star b/c you can't rate it any lower. It's a nice looking product. So if you're into collection good looking pieces of junk I'll give you this piece of s... for free!
2,low response,I expected much better reception than what I am getting. There are very few frequnces that accepy the transmission and the ones that do get a lot of interference.
3,Somthing of a disappointment,This unit doesn't work as well as I had hoped. On a radio in the house we have to put it right on the radio to get any reception. In the car we have to turn the volume completely up to hear it and even then the sound fades in and out.
1,Terrible product,Horrible...don't buy it. If you can find a place to position the unit so the radio picks it up you still will have poor quality audio. I put it in a drawer someplace and forgot about it.
3,Good But Not Great,"Every thing works great on this, all except the brodcast distance witch could leed to greater chance of interferance, but not bad at all."
3,Universal Fm Tuner,"Sorry to say not real impressed with this tuner. Hooked it up to an Ipod in my vehicle and had to keep changing channels to try to get clear sound, keep getting alot of static."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this transmitter. We tried to use it on a trip to listen to a book that we had downloaded onto our MP3 player, but the signal from the Belkin transmitter wasn't strong enough to overcome weak stations or stations on adjoining frequencies. We had to keep stopping the player, find a new frequency, and start again, about every 5-10 minutes. No fun at all!"
5,love this book,"I enjoyed reverse glass painting in the 80's and want to try it again. This book was hard to find but Amazon had access to it. Its great for reverse glass or many other surfaces, and the cardinal pattern is wonderful!"
3,The Best Mexican Wrestling Horror Movie Ever Made!,"After years of bad English dubbing and substandard TV prints, we finally get the original Spanish-language version of this psychotronic cult classic. Released in 1962, ""Santo vs. the Vampire Women"" represents the epitome of the wrestling horror genre. There's plenty of weird atmosphere, moody black-and-white cinematography and the iconic Santo kicking monster butt like nobody's business. A fascinating pop-culture artifact from south of the border."
3,The best Mexican wrestling movie,"Has the feel of a Universal 1930's b/w horror movie.This movie has two super hot vampire babes, but no nudity or sex scenes.The wrestling fights are good to watch.Wait for the right price and it's worth it."
5,Excellent!,"I've been so big fan of DJ BoBo since the summer of 1999. His songs are all great, and this album is SPECIAL among his CDs. It contains so many good songs, which has been played in the MYSTSIA tour now. Even if they are numbers you haven't listened to, you'll like them as soon as you know!"
2,Clock Radio review,Even on the dimmer of the two settings this clock's face generates enough light to read a book by. I found myself strategically positioning objects in front of it at night to block the insomnia-producing rays.Also the button lay out is very confusing. I still have to take a long look at it to figure out how to set the alarm time. Not an easy alarm clock to operate.
1,Clock Radio Review,The radio is TOO loud when it comes on. The radio is hard to tuen. The clock face is too bright in the dark and the caller ID is hard to see. This is not a very good buy.
5,beautiful songwriting,"Man, this is good stuff! Haunting and melancholy without being saccharin... very tasteful. I'm impressed. There are some excellent singles here, and the album as a whole is pure joy to listen to."
4,Long live the Moosepath League,"I'm not quite finished with Fiddler's Green, but I've read enough to know that I like it. I've found the whole Moosepath League series to be charming. The other day I was watching a Monty Python clip--Upperclass Twit of the Year--and I couldn't help wondering if this sketch may have provided a tiny bit of inspiration for the characters of Ephram, Eagleton & Thump. Not that they would ever ""kick the beggar"" or ""insult the waiter"" but the haplessness of these three men never fails to entertain. Fiddler's Green is a departure from the other books in the series because much of it focuses on Sundry Moss and an adventure he has on his own. It's a bit of a creepy adventure, too, although each of the books in the Moosepath League series flirts with the dark side just a bit. As with the other books, Van Reid inserts tantalizing bits of old New England folklore that make me want to do my own research."
2,Boring,"Mimi Fox is an excellent guitarist, but like many newer jazz artists, lacks a unique sound and good artistic feel and emotion. Part of the problem is that this CD is all over the place stylistically, which really bothers me a lot. It's impossible to get any sort of groove going. The second reviewer also correctly pointed out that Mimi tends to repeat many licks over and over."
5,"Incredible book, incredible author…","The fact that I am writing this review at 29 years old, over a decade and a half after having any interest in sci-fi (especially military sci-fi) books speaks to how well-written this book is. I would recommend anyone giving it a chance, regardless of your literary leanings... it may just surprise you."
3,A critical review,"This is a good working edition of this long neglected text. It is, however, lacking in many areas. The notes are minimal and scetchy at best, the introduction needs some filling out and any sort of critical discussion is needed. For a fuller review of this text by me please see Classical Review 50, 2000 pp.605-606."
2,STUDENT VERSION LIMITATIONS,"Students who are purchasing this product along with the CDROM should be aware that the student version is limited to 1500 cases. I recently purchased SPSS 11.0 (student version) and have not been able to use it due to such limitations. It is fine for in class assignments, but does not serve the needs of graduate students who intend to conduct research in excess of 1500 cases. You may want to invest in the non-student version to eliminate the need to purchase two SPSS programs. This limitation should be fully discolsed on the website."
2,Statistical program,There is a clear lack of coordination between the creators of SPSS and Windows. This program does not function well with newer operating systems and will not work at all with Vista. Microsoft should work to build a patch that will allow this and newer versions to run on Vista. Either that or provide a free upgrade to Windows 7 when it comes out that may allow the proper communication with older software.
5,On time!,"I was worried that this wasn't going to contain the same content that is the the Strayer University Edition, but it did and I am a very happy student! I recieved the book right on time and it's in great shape to be used! I will definitely look for products from this seller."
1,It started out good....,"........then got boring as hell. Until now, I've enjoyed all of Stephen White's books. He really got carried away with tedium and outrageousness with this one."
4,"Wow, what an incredible story!","In this book by Stephen White, the patient tells the story. It's one that will grab you from the beginning right to the last page with it's unexpected ending. Alex Delaware is still the psychologist, but he's the listener in this story and only speaks a bit at the end. You'll love the ride...it's a thought provoking and interesting piece of fiction."
2,Not half bad...,"This is my first book by White and I have to say I wasn't terribly impressed. The premise was good, but the story seemed to meander in attempts to make various statements on life and death, sucking the suspense out of it for me. It must be said that I love a faster-paced read that keeps one guessing. Readers who enjoy a lot of detail and backstory, who are able to embrace the tedium of this book, might have a different take. To sum it up, after reading the last two chapters, I just felt, 'eh'. White is obviously a talented writer, this book just wasn't the right fit for someone looking for words to fly off the page."
2,First and only by this author,"It's strange that I never started this series, living in Colorado, and reading many other local authors. Now that I have read this, I won't be reading others in the series. For 3/4 of the book, the main character, very wealthy, self-involved and completely unlikeable, flies here, flies there, talks about me, me, me, and arranges his own death if he should fall ill. He talks alot about his wife and children, but doesn't spend much time with them. I kept wondering why on earth, Thea, the wife, stayed with the jerk. There wasn't much substance to the story and it was difficult to pick up the book and keep going. Then the last 1/4 of the book got interesting. He was ill, very ill, and the consequences of his death decision becomes very real. Even with the story picking up somewhat at this point, it wasn't enough for me to root for whatshisname, and in the end, it was quite predictable."
3,Hard to root for the hero in this one...,"It is hard to root for the hero in this book. As the book progresses, you begin to feel less and less sympathetic to the main character. I thought it was a good read up to the last 50 pages because I so badly wanted to have the ""hero"" learn some sort of lesson on life. Instead, I thought it fizzled within the last 50 pages, and became predictable at that point. Entertaining, but not fulfilling."
4,A Very Satisfying Novel,"I have read all of the books in this series and Stephen White has really grown as a writer. As a therapist, I very much appreciate his focus more on the process and problems involved with therapy than on the mystery involved in the story. I find this book not quite as good as Missing Persons, but still quite rewarding. Also, he is not afraid to stretch his literary legs and try new things. I felt the characters were well developed, the writing excellent, and the insights into the work of a therapist brilliant. I highly recommend Missing Persons, the previous entry in this series, to those interested in process, ethics, and law as it pertains to the profession."
2,Interesting concept but who edited this?,"I can't give much of a review of the story as I did not make it past the first 4 pages. I would not bother entering an opinion here except that I seem to be the only one not taken with the writing style, which is what halted my plan to read this book. Was there an editor? Within the first four pages, the author uses far, far too many metaphors in so little space to refer to the car that the main character is driving --including ""an old lover,"" ""my wheeled love,"" ""the German girl with the perfect body and the motor to match,"" the girl from Stuttgart,"" and ""my girl."" This is in just 4 pages.So my advice is that if cutesy, wordy writing appeals to you, then by all means try this book--the other reviewers seemed to like it (and one even referred to it as being well-written). If you prefer the sharp, concise, far less frilly style of, say, James Patterson, you might want to pass on this."
3,3.5 Stars for this Oprah-Type Novel,"I have only read one previous Stephen White novel, but I believe this to be a departure for him. This is NOT your typical thriller and is slightly more literary and 'emotional' than your normal thriller. If you are looking for something different, and don't mind reading something that could be an Oprah Book of the month, this could be up your alley.The story makes you think. Think about what you would do if you were in that situation. Think about the death business. Think about dying. In essence, this book is through provoking, but is that really enough for me to recommend it? Possibly. Possibly not. If you are looking for the typical James Grippando, Michael Connelly or even Stephen White book, this is not it. If you are looking for something that will make you think and has some human interest, this book could be for you.You decide."
5,My first Stephen White read,"The review for this title encouraged me to read it.Having never read this author before I was a bit skeptical about the subject: suicide/cowardice/euthanasiaThe first 50 pages sets the stage. Then you are grabbed and pulled along like a tumbleweed for a fast, last ride in the life of an ""anonymous rich white guy"". It isn't until you have finished that you realize that you don't even know the name of the main character! The variety of twists and turns keeps you on edge and makes for an enjoyable read. This would make a great movie!"
2,Severely Disappointed,"I have read all of Stephen White's books and I am grossly disappointed with this book.First of all, if you're looking for Dr. Gregory--DO NOT READ THIS BOOK--he has a minor role in it. In fact, his role is more distracting than anything.Second, the story is too farfetched and isn't believable-even when you suspend your own beliefs.I'm surprised at how high the book is rated on Amazon, it's not one of White's better stories. I suggest you pay close attention to the comments posted on Amazon and make your own judgements, most are accurate."
1,A disappointment,"This was a real disappointment...I have really enjoyed previous novels by this author but this one was a waste...a arrogant guy giving us the lessons of life. Yuk. What has happened to White? I bought this book thinking I would have a story of Alan Gregory and ended up reading about a rich guy worrying about death. Give me a break. A silly, completely unrealistic story. I know most mysteries are a little to the side of reality but this one overdid it."
3,Get a New Audiobook Narrator,"I'm listening to the audiobook, but I can do without Dick Hill. The guy must have taken acting lessons from William Shatner because he takes his verbal cues from Capt. Kirk. While I have no problems with Kirk, I just don't want to hear him narrating a novel. Dick Hill ought to be banished to local theatre in some backwater town performing old Star Trek episodes. Other than that, I have no other complaints."
1,A Disappointing Read...,"I've read all of Mr. White's previous books and enjoyed them. Sadly, I can't say the same for this book.In order to want to know what happens to the main character in a book, you have to care about that person. The rich, bored, cheating-on-his-wife guy in Kill Me wasn't someone I could relate to or even care about, so I didn't care what happened to him even though I gamely struggled thru the entire book.I hope for a better next effort from Mr. White."
2,An interesting idea gone wrong,"A person may be mistaken in thinking that the words ""Kill Me"" on the front cover of this book refer to the title. In fact these are the words (along with ""please"" and ""now"") that every reader of this book will be screaming by the time they reach page 300.The problem here is that we have a writer with a reasonably good (not great) premise for a book. But by the time he finished the first two thirds, he realized he had nowhere to go with it. What happens is that the plot becomes so preposterous that your disbelief not only must be suspended, it must be tied up, gagged and tossed in a closet.I have read other Steven White books that were pretty good. This is not one of them. Avoid at all costs."
4,Good book but lacks originality...,"This book is an excellent compilation on Chinese military classics. The material is comprehensive and well organized. The only minor flaw is that it often uses passages from Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"" and Sun Pin's ""Military Methods"", which readers may already have in their library. Nevertheless, this is a good book if you don't already have any other Chinese warfare books."
3,A training manual not right for sale,This book may be good for a addtional material for free in a training program of a Crystal Reports training in author's consulting company.... I do not know why they sell the manual without adding any useful material. They sell the bone without any meat. I rate the book 3 starts becaue I think it maybe a little bit useful for the person who attend the author's training program. I have not that money and time to go that kind of training....
3,Great price,"Great price, nice product. But my eight year old son still found it would not snap together and stay together. He love his lego's more. He can build different things."
2,Infrared photography,"It's probably a very good book if you are planning to use film as your medium. For a digital photographer, the book is not particularly relevant."
4,"Uh, I don't know.","I didn't like this book to much let me tell yah. I mean, it's ok, but nothing to write home about. I guess there's some good stuff in there, but who knows?"
5,"Lyrically written, a pleasure to read aloud","Siegelson writes lyrically and gives a lovely sense of Georgia's coastal islands. The mix of history and folk tale presents well to children, and seems to capture their interest and imagination. The book is a pleasure to read aloud and held the attention of both my ten year old and my six year old."
5,A civil war triangle,"A really wonderful historical novel, well researched and true to events. Murphy 's style has improved greatly with the second part of her Promise & Honor trilogy. The plot spins breAthlessly & the reader is in suspense throughout, especially in the final paragraphs.This reader is anxious to start the final novel of the trilogy which must be about reconstruction.They characters are dynamic; we pull for them all. Interestingly, even Holly becomes human eventually, however we wouldn't't be surprised to see her up to her old tricks in the next instalment."
5,Couldn't stop with one book.,"When I discovered there was more than one book in this story, I had to have them all. Wish there were more. Great tale"
1,Delta Sanding Center,"I purchased my Delta sanding center in 1999, and it is and has served me well. I make bandsaw jewerly boxes and use the sanding center to soomth up the surface, before staining and polishing. A very useful tool.The only compliant I have with the unit is that when doing heavy sanding it is a little under powered. The belt slows down."
3,Love too sand,I purchased this sander for making poodle toys for sale at craft shows. This sander works very well except the platten spring is too weak....I put on a stiffer spring and now it works great!!
2,Please be advised!!,"This ""LED"" set does not come with LED lights!! only the two small ones are LED lights, the other ones are just old fashioned bulbs. I had to return this set due to this matter. As far as the other information it still would make a great gift for someone in need of lights, handles feel very strong and they are not heavy to carry around."
5,Pocket Guide to Occupied Japan,We received this book as a gift and love it. It is smallenough to take along with us and it has alot of pieces that are not inany of the other books we do have. The most fantastic thing about itis the updated prices. In some pieces we own they have increased in price by ( ) from the older books we own. I would highly recommend this book to any collecter of MIOJ and wish we had more updted books we really need them. This is a winner. END
5,The Complete Guide to New York Art Galleries,"This book is the perfect resource for the emerging artist. As a newcomer to the New York area, this book has proved to be an invaluable guide to galleries-from private dealers to alternative spaces-artist resources and countless other tidbits of information useful to the rookie."
5,Great Reference Guide,"Although this book would work best for an artist seeking guidance in finding the right gallery representation, it works as a great reference guide for collecting art as well."
2,Not for artists but for art buyers,"Surprisingly 9 out of 10 galleries in New York are NOT looking for new artists. This book is for a buyers market, those looking to make an ""investment"", which is the sad state of art today. If you are an artist looking to break into the N.Y. scene it will only be good as a gallery guide. Borrow a copy or get it cheap!"
3,Good Company,"In general, I have enjoyed using this handbook along with the Destinos program. The handbook contains exercises to use before, during and after viewing the episodes. Although I do not find the preview material particularly interesting, the sections that check for understanding of the episode are useful. In addition, the handbook gives the reader extra information about the characters. These sections make the video story more enjoyable and provide a chance to practice reading in Spanish. Another feature of the handbook that I particularly like is the ""notas culturas"" which expand on the culture of the Spanish countries which provide the setting for Destinos."
1,I NEVER GOT IT!,"I never got my workbook, and now I have to photocopy my proffesors entire workbook and complete it all within the next month so that I don't fail. I sure hope I can complete it on time : ("
4,TAP AND DIE SET,CUTE AND LITTLE TAP AND DIE SET. THE ONLY THING I WISH IT HAD SOME INSTRUCTIONS WITH IT. LUCKILY WE HAVE A LARGE SET AND KNOW HOW TO USE THEM. CAN'T WAIT TO GET USING THEM.
4,"Four Stars, Of Course","On their third release We Are All Beautiful People, these San Francisco pop eclectics meld quirk to melody like XTC circa Mummer. They yelp (""Wire""), they pop (""How It Goes"") , they drone like BowieEno on a midnight bender (""There Was a River""), but, most often, they yearn for love (the exquisite laments ""I Got Connected"", ""Back in France"" and ""Only Star""). Carlos Foster's five piece are miniaturists by design, with considerable talents and open hearts. His adenoidal register could keep you away, but don't let it. Future pop now."
4,For Stars Review From Aussie Fellow,"I thought Simones review hit the spot,,,I was very impressed with the 3 songs i have heard from this album,,,,,they remind me as a sort cross of bands, such as mercury rev, sebadoh , grandaddy and some others that fail to come to mind. I couldnt think I could give this 5 stars as I have not heard the entire album, but I will soon and from what Ive heard, its almost 5ieness material. Of course no one gets a 5 because no one is perfect, and that Simone sure knows what she is talking about, she sounds like a great aussie chicky babe and I love Naomi:)"
3,"For Stars.. they might become huge one day. Not yet, though.","I decided to buy this album after reading a review in a Dutch magazine, Oor. The word 'Radiohead' was mentioned, and that was enough information for me to check this album out. The magazine also featured a sample CD, which also included the track 'How It Goes' which sounded really nice.However, this track is actually the best track on the album. It's not a bad album, but it's kind of depressing. Depression is not a bad thing, but don't push it too far. Listening to this album made me smile, but made me wonder also. Wondering why For Stars didn't choose for variety. All the songs seems to sound-a-like. Surely if some songs were more happy, or rockier even, this might have been a great album. Some people will love it, but I'll probably forget about it in a while."
5,"They have ""got it figured out"".","Great CD!One song in particular blew me away: ""Science failed me""To me, in this song, the band has found its formula.It works at all levels.Lyrically - interesting and abstract enough that anyone can relate to it, yet, not pretentious or preachy.Melodically/Vocally/Harmonically - very catchy, great combination of voices and backing vocals are well placedDynamically - It soars; love the way it builds.Rhythmically - Swingin' feel catches your attention and sets it apart from others in this market.The mix itself - Very well done!"
2,ok but left too many blanks,"I would have liked to get to know the characters more and was,slightly disappointed with the ending. Kept me going though."
5,Amazing Characters,"I was suprised by this book, thought it would be a lot more like an apocalyptic big brother, but it was a absolutly brilliant."
4,good study tool,this book was used for a women's bible study. It a good tool to use when seeking to combat worry. It always raises it head to get a person in despair. The material in this study help you to make sense of the senseless thoughts that come to get you in fear. Good read for group or individual.
3,Good Ideas,"If you are looking for some good high level ideas on Project Management Methodologies, then you might want to consider this book... it does contain some good information and forms. I've used it in developing the Project Management Methodology where I am employed, mainly as a reference. However, if you are looking for a solid PM Methodology, then don't buy this book."
5,Insightful history of music,"A stunning, exciting, insightful history of music. A must read for music scholars, students and composers interested in how music has been shaped by exotic influences from Beethoven to the Beatles."
1,Monroe's Quality is sinking,"I bought two of the boot kits to replace the rubber one that lasted for almost 20 years. It comes with the bumper that is supposed to absorb the shock when the ability of the strut is exceeded when you hit a really big bump. The problem is that the bumper is just a place holder. It looks like the real thing, however it is hollow hard plastic. The second boot was obviously returned by a unsatisfied customer. It was dirty and 2 parts were missing. The item was sold directly by Amazon. My choices were to replace the item or get a refund. In other words, tie my car up for 3 more days on jack stands or walk to the nearest auto parts store that carries the item. Some choice. I just wish Amazon would insure that return items were checked out first to make sure that they contain all of the pieces before selling them to someone else."
2,Find a better fit,The sound is good enough but the design is faulty: ear buds are too flat and short to stay inside the ear. Not recommended.
5,Great collection,I grew up listening to Mike Brant and I was so excited to finally get all these great songs together. For any lover of french music this is a great selection to have Any lover of music would love having Mike Brant. His voice is that of an angel.
5,"Mike Brant, 26 August, 2001 Issaquah, WA","Mike Brant had a wonderful voice, and it's too bad his career was so short. His range was phenominal,his voice was as strong on the high notes as on the low ones. There wasn't a song on ths CD that I didn't like, which is not usually the case. ""Laisse Moi T'Aimer"" and ""Qui Saura"" are especially beautiful. This is a wonderful CD by an exceptional artist, it deserves 5 stars."
3,Here are Scales and Modes,"This may be a helpful compendium for those who need a scale and mode reference. It is rather lacking in the area of melodic possibilities. The examples are, with a couple of useful exceptions, obvious entry level sequences. Disappointing."
1,Double Buyers Remorse,I say double buyers remorse because I bought two of these phones for Christmas one for me and one for my mother. Both worked fine for a while and then they both started to act up. Mine started acting up first it started having an erratic display and the radio would come on by itself. Then my mothers started having a squealing sound come from her phone. Neither one of the phones has lived up to having the proper caller id function either as we have other caller ids that work much better than these phones. The company does give good repair service though and they are prompt about repairing their products. You do have to pay a five dollar fee though to get the product repaired. I hope this review was helpful to you.
1,waste of money,"This product is the absolute pits. The audio is harsh and definitely unpleasant. When using the phone you can hear the radio in the handset even though the radio if off. As for the lighted radio dial........forget it. The dial has a narrow vertical slot through which a very dim LED lights. Since the dial markings are on either side of this slot, its impossible to see what station your trying to locate. Additionally, the caller ID display is also hard to see even if the contrast is adjusted to your liking. The brightness of the called ID display as depicted in the ad is misleading at best. Avoid this product at all costs. Believe me you won't be satisfied with it."
1,buyers remorse,"This product is awful! The radio reception is extremely inferior and when I'm trying to use the phone, and the phone receiver volume is on high, I hear the radio through the receiver (even if the radio is ""off""). Additionally, it is larger than it appears in the picture on-line. It is going back tomorrow!!"
3,Works fine after 8 years,"To cut to the quick this phone /radio/alarm has worked fine for many years for me. Yes, it's dated and now there may be better options but it does what it's supposed to. The FM will dial in more stations than my car radio will and that's a 2006 model. The LCD is a little bright even at the low setting. The caller Id stores more than any other phone I have and the callback is a nice feature. It's a cheap phone/alarm clock/radio that you can put on your side table in the bedroom. It serves it's purpose well. I don't really use the phone feature too often. The cord could be longer. Just thought I'd add my 2 cents. It has performed as expected many years not a problem."
1,Find something better,"This item is just plain disappointing. The caller ID display is impossible to adjust and read. Radio reception is ok. The phone is adequate, but barely. Find a different one if you want the caller ID function."
3,Good phone and clock - lousy FM reception,"The phone works great. A nice feature is that if the radio is on, it will cut off if you pick up the handset to answer the phone or make a call.The biggest problem I have with this is the radio reception. The AM radio tends to work very well and I have no problems with it. However, there is no external FM antenna of any type! I mean, how hard is it to run one of those thin wire antennas out the back of the unit? My radio is literally 5 inches from a window on the second floor and I have difficulty picking up some of the local stations. The static can be horrible!Overall, this is a good buy if you're listening to a station the radio can pick up clearly!"
1,Drops connections,Experience with this product for a month or so leaves me sorry I bought it. Frequently drops connections to clients (2-3 times daily). Several different firmware images have not improved this condition.Experience lately with several Linksys products has made me skittish on purchasing any Linksys products in the future. Have a new AP from a different manufacturer on order now - am looking forward to abandoning this product.Update:Purchased aTRENDnet 300Mbps Wireless N Access Point TEW-638APB (Version V1.0R)to replace this. Consider this before purchasing the Linksys device - much better AP for the buck than this product.
1,Nightmare - avoid at all costs,"After a day of comprehensive testing both in various modes (G-only, B/G/N mixed) and with different security configurations (no encryption, WPA2-Personal/AES) the unit was spectacularly unreliable both with Intel and Linksys NICs. I upgraded the firmware to the most current release before testing began. Absolutely ridiculous, given that my WAP54G access point has been extremely reliable.After a string of recent disappointments with driver quality and availability, this is the last straw for me. I've been buying a lot of Linksys hardware over the past few years, but now I've had enough. I'm taking a look at Intel, Netgear and D-Link hardware in future for all purchasing requirements, and am not going to bother taking a look at Linksys again, life's too short. That's it.Linksys senior management feel free to phone me personally (look me up in google) to tell me why I should ever evaluate their products again. But I suspect the company simply doesn't care."
1,Blows BIG TIME,"This thing blows big-time. I manage, design, and install networks for a living. I installed this in my house to compliment my new Dell laptop with wireless-N and I can say that my dvd rewinder was a better investment. PoE is pretty cool, which is why I bought it, but it's the only feature that works reliably. Drops connections pretty frequently only to reconnect a few minutes later. Range is good, but even at 10 feet, I reliably get 5% of my internet connection bandwidth. If you're really good at setting these things up (which, again, I do for a living), the setup is pretty easy. Using it, however, isn't such a pleasure.Absolutely horrified--I got better performance from 10 year old 802.11FH, which you can pick up for about $10 on ebay.Sucks balls... big time."
1,No more linksys for me,"I had this Wireless Access Point for a little bit more than a year, and today it quit working, no more Wireless access for any of the computers nor web interface access. This is the second device I have from linksys that stoped working suddenly."
5,Awesome combo,I just received this kit for Christmas and have been using it for a few weeks. As a novice woodworker I was looking for a quality nailer at an affordable price. I think I found it. Its as good as Wood Magazine says it is. I would recommend this nailer to anyone interested in woodworking.
2,Hugely disappointing,"I loved Benoit's first book ""Relative Danger."" Unfortunately, I can't say the same for his second. Except for his descriptions of India, which I enjoyed, I never felt connected to the character, never understood the love interest, found the clues so blatant you'd have to be blind to miss them and the story completely predictable. It was completely devoid of the humor I found in the first book. In all, it was hugely disappointing and I'd be hard pressed to read another by this author."
4,Quirky adventure mystery,"I liked this book a lot. It has interesting characters including a very strong-willed young woman (beautiful too, aren't they all?) and most of the story takes place in India. The author has spiced up the narrative with adventures and descriptions of what it is like in that country in places including Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai. There are twists and suspenseful episodes throughout. Having been to India twice, I enjoyed remembering how it was. I found it hard to put down."
5,Cute,"Decided to buy Scruff because of the other positive reviews. He's floppy, very soft, has a great expression and loves his new home in London :)"
2,cute but made in china and not very durable,This toy is cute but it is not very durable. Would prefer toys like this made in USA not chinese junk.
3,Cute but Low Quality,"My husband ordered Scruff for our 16-month old because he was constantly asking to hold our four-year-old's stuffed dog lovey. Scruff arrived and the little one was THRILLED! He took to him immediately and they are now the best of friends. The fabric is wonderfully soft and cuddly. Unfortunately, after just one day with him at daycare, Scruff came home with a huge hole in the seam on the back. Luckily, our son hadn't noticed, and Scruff still had all of his stuffing and beads. I was able to ""operate"" and sew him back up to be used. However, I'm very disappointed that after just one day of use (and not rough use), Scruff needed repairs. My four-year-old's dog was mine when I was young and has never needed fixing. As long as you can sew any busted seams, it's a worthwhile purchase. However, if you're at all uncomfortable with a needle and thread, I would skip this stuffed friend to find another, more durable, choice."
4,Ouch.,"This is truly next level. I guess I should have expected something like this from the label that brought us Prince Paul (De La Soul), Sensational (Jungle Brothers), and Doug Scharin's Him (June of 44, Rex). Funky, strange and sometimes even a bit melancholy, I simply did not see this one coming. I'm afraid it may be lost on most Americans. Maybe I'm being unfair."
4,Cocooned Hysterical Melancholy,"Most of the tracks take you on a fantastical voyage to steampunk paranoia and paint klimtian paintings...some just grate your ears. A charming purchase, but not essential."
1,Look further before buying,"Keep looking! this little crap camera is so cheap looking and feeling that everytime i carry this around, the batteries are always missing because the battery door has become dis lodged.Lets not even start with the amount of dollars you will be throwing down the pooper in replacement batteries. (makes you question why you didn't get the higher priced cameras?!)The advertised 4.1 megapixels is a flat out lie. i have contacted Target Inc. directly to notify them of a potencial false advertising claim by shoppers. I have extensive photography training and this camera at best is about a 1.2 megapix- at best.."
5,Ton of Batteries Needed,This camera is a real bargain for the bucks. It's unbelievable what it will do considering it's price and small size. The only drawback is it goes through AAA alkaline batteries like they're going out of style. I've had mine for about a month and have gone through at least 14 batteries. Check to see if there is a battery pack of another type than alkaline for this camera before buying.
4,Great Product!! Well worth the money!,"Aiptek PocketCam X PC Camera (POCKETCAMXCCS) (POCKETCAMX)I recently Bought Tha Aiptek Pocket Cam X on amazon. I in total have 8 of these cameras. The main purpose was for the video. The camera part is ok as if you have a tripod you can take great 2 mp pictures. You really don'tneed 3-8 mp. I have a Kodak camera which has 5 mps. I only use 3. [...] THe only disavantage is it doesnt have auto stabilitasion.Pros:Small,LightwieghtTakes up to 36 minutes of video on a 512mb sd card.Lcd screentakes great video.Cons:Not very good with picturesOverall it is worth the money. I hope I help You decide."
5,Still a fan of Mr. Smith,"I have enjoyed several novels authored and coauthored by Dean Wesley Smith. This novel has ensured my continued fan status. ""The Tenth Planet"" was a very enjoyable and absorbing read--difficult to put down. Too often in this genre, characters are one-dimensional or mere plot devices incapable of seeing the world beyond their labels (i.e., scientists, generals, politicians, invaders)--it is refreshing to meet characters with some character. I look forward to the sequels."
3,One-third of a great book.,"I would feel a lot better about this book if I hadn't of paid full price for 1/3 of a book. The book is entirely too short, and resolves none of the issues identified at the beginning. Even the quality of the paper in the book was very poor, making me think that I've been had, even though I enjoyed the read.My advice: Wait for all three books to come out, and then go to the library or your used book store."
5,This is a great book!,This is a great book that you have trouble putting down! I strongly suggest reading The Tenth Plant Oblivion and The Tenth Planet Final Assualt.
3,Average read at best...,"I enjoyed the book, but thought the pace was a little slow. Maybe that's because nothing really happened with the aliens until the latter quarter of the book. However, the plot was believable and the characters were likeable.The end of the book was a surprise since it is nothing more than a cliff-hanger that's intended to get you to buy the next book. The authors may as well have extended the book and written in a true ending. I can't see them creating a whole new book based on the events of the cliff hanger. But I suppose they will."
2,What a con!,"Well-written, engaging novel which appears to have no other purpose than to shill for the computer game ""The Tenth Planet"" which is touted at the end of the book. There simply was no resolution to this story -- it ends ""in the middle"" so to speak and I think that's a real cheat! I do NOT recommend this book to anyone unless he or she is interested in and inclined to buy computer games. Otherwise, pass!"
1,Save your money,"I don't know what exactly these other people were reading but this book is neihter original nor spectacular. I think I saw this type of plot line in the movie Independence Day. I think this was the worst book I have ever read. Also, there had better be a sequal because the way this book ends is awful. It seemed as if the authors either got tired of writing this or they had to beat a deadline. I t just seemed like the story was cut a little short."
2,1/3 of a novel,"To me, a good pulp fiction novel has to stand as a complete work, even if it's part of a larger group - - in this case, a trilogy. That's the problem with ""The Tenth Planet."" At the end of the book, nothing's explained. The reader has no more idea how this plot will resolve than he did on page one.Unlike Stephen King's excellent serial novel, ""The Green Mile,"" this book had very little on the cover blurbs to indicate that it was only a part of a continuing project. This is less a novel than it is a slick marketing ploy by the publisher to rope you into buying the next two books in the series. I may have been inclined to do that - - the writing and ideas in this book are, on the whole, good. But I'm not going to, because I just don't feel like being jerked around."
4,Entertainint and quick read.,"The Tenth Planet was a good read. It moved along quickly. The only problem I had with it was that it answered none of the questions it asked. If you're not interested in reading the other 2 in the trilogy, don't start this one."
5,WOW!! What a Different and Powerful book!!,"I bought this book right before the Fourth of July weekend. I just finished it and all I can say is WOW!!. This is the first book that I have read by these authors and I can;t say enough good things about it. A Different kind of First contact story with an ending that will want you to read the sequels. Good characters, enough science to keep you interested and quick plotting kept my interest up for the whole book. Why do I have to wait until Fall 99 for more? Bring them on now!!!"
2,"Interesting premise, faulty execution",The Tenth Planet is the first of a trilogy of books (Tenth Planet: Oblivion & Tenth Planet: Final Assault) that appears to have been written as a tie-in to a video game. The first book is a good light read that raises some interesting plot threads that unfortunately are not followed through with books 2 and 3. It seems as if most of the effort for this series was placed in book one and rest of the series is uninteresting filler written to fulfill the book contact.
5,Complete page-turner!,"This book was amazing. I couldn't put it down. Set within the foreseeable future, Smith and Rusch paint a very believable picture of cultural and technological development. The characters are well developed and have substance, they come alive. Realistic portrayals of science, scientists and researchers from archaeology to biology to nanotechnology to astronomy. Wonderful by-play between the government and the private sector. All the while there's the tingling suspense as more pieces of the puzzle fall into place and the countdown continues...I did not know while reading this story that it was the first book in a trilogy! At the time, the second and third book were not yet released! I nearly pulled my hair out in frustration. Now that all the books are available, buy all 3. Don't start this book without the other two right beside you! You'll breeze right through them in a weekend."
5,the best in scholarship of the middle east,"The book is an excellent collection of cutting edge writing on women.Further, anything written by Susan Slyomovics is spellbinding. I have become quite a fan of her publications. She has a unique viewpoint; she allows her sensitivity to culture of the Middle East and her own humanity to shine through her academic production. Another writer like this is Michael Sells. It has been a long time coming."
2,What the...........,"I loved the movie, but the DVD is EDITED. There were several scenes that have been edited (I am assuming for nudity and content since the film revolves around a porn set).I don't really have a problem with the nudity, but there were several scenes that were crucial to the story...especially right before the murder takes place (it is something Barbara Hershey finds in her boyfriends office. On video, you see what she sees, in the DVD you don't....if I wanted an edited film, I would have watched it on the Lifetime Network."
2,EDITED version but still watchable (barely).,"I recently purchased this DVD and after watching it I felt like I had just watched a television edit of this movie. I got online and did some searching for the specs of the VHS version and it turns out that this DVD version has some 14 minutes of footage removed. The original movie is 106 minutes and this DVD is 92 minutes (NOT 106 minutes like it says on this website). It even has printed on the DVD box that it has an R rating. The movie as it is on this DVD could easily get a PG-13 rating or maybe pass as a PG rated film. If you are in fact looking for a heavily cleaned up version of this film, this release might be your ticket. But, if you think by ordering this you're getting the R rated thriller that you remember, think again, this DVD edition is the watered down TV edit."
1,PLATINUM frauded us and sold us the edited tv version,Wow i am so disapointed with the dvd release that's 92 minutes it really took away from the original vhs version that was 104 minutes long! I remember being a kid and seeing this movie i watched it a dozen times and loved it! So when i saw it was on dvd on amazon i bought it without even reading the reviews. Platinum/echo bridge should remake the dvd without editing out most of the scenes that made this movie so impacting i think us viewers can handle the adult content that was originally in the movie without movie companies deciding what we should and should not see! I was so excited waiting for this to come in the mail and now im feeling bummed thanks alot platinum dvd and echo bridge.
2,lots of screen time for Hershey,"This is one of the scandalously few top billings in Barbara Hershey's career. As such, the iron-stomached film viewer will at least get to enjoy lots of BH screen time for his suffering. Other than that, not much.Irrelevant but amusing: I read somewhere that during the filming of this movie Sam Shepard would whine every time he had to do anything involving the least bit of action. (Jackie Chan heroics are not involved, you understand.) What a wussy!"
3,edible but not great,"I bought this because everyone in my 4-adult household likes to have granola bars and similar bars for snacks and for those occasions when breakfast has to be quick. We generally like hemp bars; many people dislike the taste of hemp. For hemp bars, though, these don't taste so great. My college-age vegetarian daughter, who likes all kinds of healthy foods, says these taste like dirt. My opinion is ""They aren't BAD,"" but I won't buy them again."
5,Couldn't be more pleased,Product is great. We are using this in a small office and love the fact that it makes great coffee so quickly. Would highly recommend this product.
2,Not strong enough coffee,"The coffe maker works great and does make the coffee in about 3 min, but the amount of coffee you put in it does not make the coffee strong enough for our taste. We tried to add a little more coffee and the grounds over flowed."
4,Always Wanted a Bunn,"My wife finally took the hint and purchased me a Bunn BX-B for Christmas. I must say that I haven't been dissapointed. Although it seemed to haven taken longer than 15 minutes to heat the water to 200 degrees (more like 10 hours), it now makes a nice hot cup of coffee. The carafe it somewhat hard to posiion on the warming plate, yet no major issue. I'm sure I will grow to appreciate the product more as the years pass."
2,WELLLLL,"Well i recieved the coffee maker promptly from Amazon,and did what the instructions setforth to set up the maker for the first time. After a couple hours I started to smell a little burning smell, you know a burning wire smell. Also I noticed that the coffee was not hot enough. I had to put it in the micro after I put in my cream. Tried to live with it a week or so but no, it's pricy and Bunns are better than that. This was obviously just a defect, it happens in mass production. So I did a return to Amazon. No problems , I sent it back got credit and now looking for another. AMAZON ROCKS. They even covered the postage on the way back."
5,Bunn BX-B Classic Coffee Brewer,"We had had a Bunn Coffee Brewer for years and got a leak in the reservoir tank. We bought another brand to replace it, the one that doesn't have a coffee pot that has like a soft drink dispenser AND HATED IT! So, I went online looking at Bunns. I found the exact one I was looking for on Amazon. The price was a little less than other sites and at the time free shipping.I won't ever have any other brand but Bunn and my experience with Amazon was awesome!"
4,Love my Bunn!,I love my Bunn! It is the best coffee maker I have ever owned! It is worth the price! The only probelm I have with it is that if I grind my beans too fine the water will overflow out of the basket so I have learned to grind my beans coarsely. Other than that I love it!
1,OK compared to others,"Our last BUNN lasted 16 years. Although this product is superior to what is available now it certainly is not what was replaced. If you have your original coffee pot and coffee filter holder, I would use them with this product and throw away what is sent with the coffee maker. The coffee pot sent with the coffee maker is horrible, and the filter holder is barely recognizable as a BUNN product. Without substituting products from my original BUNN coffee maker, this purchase would have been useless."
5,BUNN ADDICT,"Over the past 25 years I have owned 3 of this same Bunn coffee maker. I love having my coffee within seconds and it makes the greatest coffee. I like the glass carafe since you can see how much coffee is left. The thermal one I gues are good but you can not tell how much you have in the pot. When I went searching for a replacement (they do eventually leak) there was nothing that appealed to me and I kept coming back to my Bunn. I received my Bunn in 3 days and I am a Bunn, coffee, and Amazon addict. All my on line purchases are from Amazon. They do such a great job and I feel completely safe using my credit card with them."
3,One year ago...,"I bought this coffee maker and everything was great!! Now my BUNN makes every coffee I brew taste weird like burned rubber, this was an over night issue and since been cleaning it every way I can to save this amazing product it once was. I bought it directly from BUNN and spent over $100 for it because I really thought this brand would last me a very long time. Not too happy with this coffee maker."
3,Disappointed,"I've had a few disappointments with this coffee maker. The high volumne sprayhead had to be replaced with a lower volumne one to solve the problem of spraying the grounds over the top of the filter. Then the coffee making time is no longer three minutes. I also find grounds in the coffee, am very careful putting coffee in the filter, but haven't solved that problem yet."
2,Bunn BX-B Classic Review,"We love coffee and have plenty of so called ""Connoisseurs"" in our household. This coffee pot is for the office of quick and easy & not for the discriminating coffee lovers. The temperature is just not hot enough and the rapid spray of water really does not do the coffee beans justice. I would not purchase this coffee pot if you enjoy good coffee. Quick, yes."
5,Bunn,"This is my 3rd. Love the Bunn. The coffee brews in 3 minutes, and is constant on flavor. Love it"
5,REALLY AWESOME COFFEE MAKER,"I have been looking for a new coffee maker and went to consumer reports, Amazon, Qvc, HSN, and read all the reviews.So this is the one I picked, and I am so blessed that I picked this coffee maker, on a score from 1 to 10 I give it a big 10. Coffee is brewed hot; we grind our own coffee beans, as we do not buy coffee out in the coffee shops. What we do buy is the best coffee beans we like, Dunkin Donuts, Green Mountain Yankee Doodle, Coffee by Design here in Maine.If you want a good cup of coffee buy this unit, and you will not be sorry. Remember that when you go out to the coffee shops and pay $2.08 for a large, that is $64.20 a month for just one cup of coffee a day, think of the nice coffee maker you could have, and the best beans ground at home. We also have the Bunn coffee grinder, that we have had for three years now.God Bless,Lenny Gauba Maine"
2,Not hot enough,"I bought this to replace an older Bunn which I loved, but was accidentally ruined by my wife. However, the new model does not heat the water hot enough. I performed several tests and the water conistently comes out at 180 degrees. This is below Bunn's stated temperature of 190. Ten degrees may not sound like much, but it makes a big difference.I usually put a pot of coffee in a thermos after it is brewed. Since the Bunn's brewing temperature is so low, the coffee does not stay warm for very long. I believe that a good coffee maker should heat the water a little above 190 so that the coffee comes out hot.I believe other reviewers have had the same complaint. I sure wish Bunn would go back to their old design. I think this is going to be the last Bunn I will purchase."
3,Not so hot,"The time it took to get this coffeemaker was ridiculous, and the seller was unresponsive at first, and then pretty much rude when I asked if they would be shipping it at all. The coffee maker itself makes a mess every time we use it - blows grounds all over the place - and I would not buy another, especially from this seller. I gave it too many stars; but I can't seem to undo them so, oh well."
1,Disappointed in the Bunn,"I'm a BIG coffee drinker and I thought the Bunn would be a coffee lover's delight. It turned out to be my biggest nightmare. It takes a lot to set it up and get it started. If you make a mistake and close the cover before you have the pot in place, boy what a mess. It leaked out the bottom and was VERY large and heavy. Took up way to much room on my counter. I dumped it after one week and bought a Farberware coffee maker and it is just as good, if not better. It's small, easy to run, and the coffee tastes great.Deb in New Hampshire"
2,Disappointing carafe!,"The Bunn BXB Velocity Brew makes terrific hot coffee in only 3 minutes! This is a great concept for avid coffee drinkers. But pouring the hot coffee all over your hand, cup and countertop because the carafe is so badly designed and the lid is so flimsy was such a letdown! We even tried other brands of great carafes from inferior coffeepots but they wouldn't work. Awesome coffeepot was returned for lack of a workable carafe."
4,Fast Coffee,I owned my previous Bunn for 20 years. It finally gave up the ghost and I bought another. Best drip coffee maker out there.
3,I agree with the others that this does not get the coffee hot enough,"I have owned Bunn coffee makers for the past 6 years. This is my second Bunn, the first was the thermal carafe. I got this one to replace the thermal carafe when it was recalled, but also because I like my coffee hot and I felt like my coffee was always too cold too soon. This one has a warmer so I thought that would help. But I think the other people are right, that the brewer doesn't get the water hot enough to begin with. Other than that, It has been great. Very fast. I will always have a Bunn."
2,melting plastic smell,"Returned after 3 weeks of use for persistent smell of hot, melting plastic. And yes, the tank was always full of water and it was used 1-2 times daily."
2,Crapped out after 3 years - Done with Bunn,"I paid a little extra money because it is a Bunn and they supposed to be the end all be all of coffee manufacturers. It was completely dead after three years. Should have bought a cheaper one. To be fair it was used M-F once a day in a very small office. That is the same amount of coffee we make at our house every week, and the Capresso brand coffee maker is working on its 13th year of service."
3,Coffee's not hot enough,"When you read something in more than one review you should take heed. Several reviews stated that this Bunn doesn't make or keep the coffee very hot. My previous Bunns never had that problem, so I ignored the warnings. Well, guess what? The coffee isn't very hot. I assume the problem is with the water thermostat because it does get a little hotter as it sits on the warming plate. I want hot coffee, therefore I'm very disappointed in this coffee pot.This is my third Bunn. My first one lasted 20 years. My second started leaking in less than three years and this one brews warm coffee. I will most likely look for alternatives when I need my next coffee maker."
5,Bunn coffee maker BX-B,"A good speedy coffee maker, if it used daily. It has a built in heated water reservior and the water can go ""stale"" and evaporate it not used at least every few days. Make sure you turn it off if you are away more than a few days."
1,Complete Junk!!!!!,"This product is junk it broke after 4 months and now they wont honor repair unless I return in its original box and pay for shipping myself. I was told by everybody that this was the best to buy but it didn't even last five months, I set it up by the book followed all their instructions to a T no dice I'd give product no stars if I could. $100+ Dollars and its made of mostly plastic garbage."
3,"Good Coffee fast, just didn't last long",sadden to say my Bunn BXB broke where the water meets the filter. Great coffee just not long lasting. Only had 1 year.
5,Look at this fool below me,Baby Rasta y Gringo have being singing reggaeton since the 90's papi. They are the best duo around. You're probably one of those new heads in reaggaeton.Baby rasta y gringo Papi! Suuuuuuuuuuuu.
5,A real pleasure!,"I wanted a quality means of getting my old VHS home videos (VHS and Super 8). This product worked VERY well.A few highlights that you WONT find in many many cheaper products:-Audio STAYS on sync with video (there is an audio sync lock)-Analog to Digital AND digital to Analog.-Doesn't require a power plug-Simple to use-You can use it with your own video editing program EASILY. (no annoying cheap bundled software - amen to that!) I use Adobe Premiere Elements 8 and Adobe Premiere Pro CS4, but anything will work.-It comes up under windows (NO DRIVERS REQUIRED) as an audio/video device. This means it's VERY easy to use in any video program.-True Plug&Play;-Analog to Digital through conversion without computer (UNTESTED - I think it would work - don't take my word on it)I highly recommend this quality product!"
3,Apple iMac Canopus ADVC110 Needs Cable Purchase,"While I have not finished my installation of the Canopus product, I did want to take a moment and hopefully stop Christmas insanity for many that expect to open this up and start using it Christmas day.1. If you have an iMac product, verify that you have the right cable from the Canopus to the 1394B (Very important the -B- part) port on the Mac. The device ships with a 1394 cable, but not the B Connector one used on the iMac.2. Pick up the RGB cables if you are using an older VCR. You will need those cables to come out of the VCR and into the Canopus.I am currently working on an installation of their included software as I need to get moving on a transfer. I will update the device specifically once the software is functioning.JJD - Christmas Cable Avoidance..."
5,As advertised,"I opened the box, followed the brief but adequate instructions and began converting my first VHS to digital in minutes. It worked as advertised.It's great when a piece of electronics work so simply and easily."
4,"Works well for the cost, allows you to bring in pretty good quality video",I used it to transfer VHS tapes from old home movies. Works well and brings in high quality DV for you to convert on a video processing application of your choosing.
4,"Finally, a digitizer that really works","I've been using a digitizer for years that produced videos that looked good, sounded good - but didn't synch audio well, especially after editing. That's because (evidentally) it was saving as mpeg. Canopis saves as huge AVI, but it works!"
5,Performs as expected,"The Canopus ADVC110 converts analog video to DV smoothly. I use it to convert a live 4-camera mix from an Edirol switching board to DV so it can all be recorded live to a hard drive on a computer at my church. Prior to this we were recording in mpeg2 format to a Toshiba DVR. Now we can capture in DV which is superior in quality and editability. The services we record are generally over 45 minutes, and the unit never sputters during the long sessions. The software I use to capture is Adobe OnLocation, and I'm using a Quad-Core computer. The Canopus works flawlessly with this setup."
4,Canopus ADVC110,"I got it to archive DVR'd material. Next I'm gonna try and use it to get all my audio cassettes and LP's into my MP3 library. It works like it should. Directions are a bit confusing, mostly because of the British terminology. But it could be a bit simpler. The dip switches and their settings leave a bit to be desired. More plug n play would be better. Again tho, not a bad product for the price."
1,I am not happy with this item.,"1-) There is no statement telling the customer ""NO BULB"" is included in the purchase. So I discovered that I would wait an other week for the bulbs after I received the order.2-)This item is not 500W, It is 250W. I discovered this after I opened the box.3-)Even the seller company web site does not contain an open statement, that bulb was not included in the purchase.Best Regards."
5,Great adventure story,"One of the best modern American adventure stories. A relatively easy read. These guys swam more than 100 rapids on the frigid Colorado River wearing nothing but rubber shirts and wool longjohns - carrying thier sleeping bags, food and camera equipment in rubber boxes. Absolutely amazing - and their story had me with butterflys in my stomach just reading about what they did."
5,hah,"i bought this for really cheap from the amazon marketplace because it said there was ""some writing."" that some writing turned out to be the author's signature. sweet! other than that, this is a great read that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys outdoors-y stuff or grand canyon history."
5,Great Read for Adventure Lovers,"This book is about two guys who decide to take a ""cheap"" vacation and swim the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. It's a good read and a lot of fun."
3,AmazNG,GREAT FOR WRITING A REPORT BUT SOME VERY TOUGH VOCAB. I DID A RESEACH PROJECT AN IT WEAS EXELENT !!!!!
3,Wonderful book!,"I always wanted to know more about the great minds and especially Leonardo Da Vinci. After the film I had the urge to know more and this book certeinly tells more about his life. Simply, A wonderful book!"
3,doesn't capture the magic of Bella Lea,"The Lottery is by all means a sound EP - the songwriting is solid but the production is just overblown. Having been a big Denali fan and also a really big Bella Lea fan before they changed their name, I was let down. The earlier versions of these songs were so much more sincere, intimate and full of character. So, if you own the old Bella Lea demos, I'd give caution on buying this record. That being said, it's still pretty good."
5,Nice grill accessory,"I bought this as a replacement for the original grill in my RoadTrip that I have for 6 years now. I didn't have to get one because the original held up well, but just wanted something without the grit that built up over the years. The grit is my fault, actually BBQ chicken's fault, but it could of been cleaned better by me if I was more vigilant. I intend to use the new one for dogs, burgers, sausage and use the old one for messy marinated cooking.My buddy has the RoadTrip with the steel grates and he has a much harder time cleaning it than I do. My original still has all the teflon on it, and I have scraped it with metal utensils! I always think about buying a big grill, but never do because I like this RoadTrip so much. I use foil under the grates instead of water and that works great. Anyway, I give it 5 stars."
3,Grill grate a problem,I bought one of the first out and I found the first few times of use that it performed well. I even took it camping with me in its handy cary bag. after a while the grates became more difficult and then near impossible to clean (esp after barbecued chicken )I also found dumping the greasy water became a problem becaust the base tray that held the water took quite a while to clean up. I have literally stopped using the thing -though I see that they have now come out with porcelinized grates which I would consider purchasing. If I could get a ss base tray I'd spring for the price.
3,Decent,Not bad. Debated between the cast iron and aluminum. Went with aluminum because thats what the original grill came with and I wanted even heating temperatures.
2,Good except,"This replacement was needed because there was no warning that a grease fire could melt this cast aluminum type of grill. It does say to be sure to place water in the grill, however; the warning should be more stern. A grease fire in this grill could cause a major fire if grease is allowed to build up."
4,Nonstick surface is great when cared for properly,"These grill grates are very nice, but you have to treat them the same way you treat any piece of non-stick cookware. Rule #1: no metal implements. You have to use nylon or wood implements or you'll scratch the nonstick coating off. Rule #2: use plain sponges or abrasive pads that are non-stick safe only (usually the blue pads). SOS pads and other green pads can scour through metal and will definitely remove the non-stick coating.After using my Road Trip for about a year, I'm beginning to see flaking of the non-stick coating. They still work great, but take a little more effort to completely clean. I'm probably going to try the cast iron grill grate next."
1,Mine melted.,Mine melted so I went back to cast iron. I will watch to see if they keep selling this because it seems dangerous.
2,non stick to thin,I purchased this grill because it was aluminum and had a non stick coating. They clean up easily unfortunately the non stick coating is very thin and comes off using a scotch brite sponge. I knew to be careful but didn't think I had to be that careful. I assumed it would be as durable as most non stick appliances. So much for assuming. Cast iron may of been a better long term choice.
5,Simply awesome. Protects my car in winter conditions and rain beautifully.,"I love this stuff. I've been using it once every 4-6 months. I have a 2005 that was in great condition when I purchased it in 2010. I like to apply it always after a thorough wash; once before the winter months in Ohio, and once again for summer time.I plan to use this as my choice of Wax for protecting my vehicle and preserving it's value cosmetically."
1,HATE THIS BOOK!,"Very confusing English,i wonder some sentences are grammatically incorrect. I have never come across a such a horrible book.I bought this for my school or else,would never spent a cent on such a poor composition. If it isn't a necessity DON'T BUY IT! if it is , PLEASE go to a library and go through the book before you buy it. good luck"
1,"Bought for class, served its purpose","I bought this book strictly for a class, and used it as strictly. I barely used it for more than to do the weekly assigned homework from the end of each chapter. If you can get the problems from a friend, anything in this book can probably just be Googled instead."
3,good value for money,received the unit 3 days after purchase..styling and features wereacceptable...REMOTE CONTROL WILL NOTCONTROL VOLUME..makes it sorta useless..sounds okay...
5,"Sounds great, but it sure is homely","I just received our JVC box last night-- we purchased it to lull our five-week-old to sleep. It sounds super, and plays lullabies (on tape and on CD) flawlessly, but do look closely at the picture before you buy... blue-and-black-on-white is a bit much.I'd absolutely buy it again, and the price is right, but I wouldn't plan on making it the centerpiece of your room."
2,"fine musicianship, weak songwriting","Nice production and solid musicianship are the good points of this record. On the downside, Alan Charing seems content to recycle the same, vaguely bluesy (non)melody on each and every song. At a glance, the lyrics may seem compelling, but look a little closer and one finds macho hipster posturing with no substance to prop up the disjointed ramblings. I really wanted to like this record. Honest! Oh well..."
5,Fascinating historical vignette,This story sets the reader inside the mind of 14-year-old Cecilia in a day and place most readers will find unfamiliar. The details of daily life in this rural community are told in a way that make one yearn for that simpler time. But the over-all story of a family big on love and closeness and a young girl determined to find her own way is universal. A very enjoyable book -- loved the proverbs!
3,rafiki yangu,"After reading a raving review I was expecting more. Too melodramtic and pretenious for my taste. If you like your African music smothered in the ""Pop Jazz"" vein maybe this is for you. Nice backing vocals, though I found myself reaching for the fast forward button far too often. I'll stick with my compilation of modern South African music on the Earthworks label."
2,Flawed on Some Fundamentals,"Not a fan of the truth-functional definition of ""if...then"" introduced on p. 11. An ""if...then"" should not change its truth value from case to case! An ""if...then"" is a generalization about all possible cases and is thus true IN ALL POSSIBLE CASES or false IN ALL POSSIBLE CASES! Neither am I a fan of the truth-functional definition of ""iff"" given on the same page. Like ""if...then,"" an ""iff"" should not change its truth value from case to case! An ""iff"" is a generalization about all possible cases and is thus true IN ALL POSSIBLE CASES or false IN ALL POSSIBLE CASES!And this is only p. 11! Unfortunately these two flawed fundamental concepts taint the entire book. I cannot comfortably read this book because I am afraid what I'm reading might be based off of these misconceptions.This book needs a through revising, and it will not at all look the same once this is done."
5,A Pearl of Great Price,"Gordon D. Fee has written an amazing commentary on one of my favorite books in the Bible: Philippians. Fee does an excellent job outlining the essentials and pointing out the significance of certain passages. He has written a much larger work on Philippians before undertaking this one. Though short, this book will guide you through and bring you near to the very heart of Paul. Fee is an outstanding Pentecostal scholar with passion and sober exegetical methods. I highly recommend this book. In fact, I recommend anything written by Gordon D. Fee!"
4,"Great, but. . . .","I love this book, such a wide variety of smoothies to choose from. The author was very creative with the names for each drink. The ingrediants are very simple and easy to find. I live in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and every ingrediant is stocked all year round. My only complaint is that the book contains no pictures at all. Only the cover has a picture of a smoothie. Basically, the book is great. Try the Ultimate Fuzzy Nazel, yum!"
1,Faulty remanufacture.,"I purchased this item knowing that it was a remanufactured and trusting that it would work. I spent the time to read the instructions and connected it properly to the TV. After turning it on I received a distorted picture the same as I would receive if I had been on the wrong radio frequency. I tried turning the unit off and found that that was only possible if I pulled the plug. I was given permission to return this item, but was not offered a replacement unit since I had purchased the last unit in stock. I have since purchased the same model number remanufactured from another source and it works excellent."
5,"Sit back, relax and enjoy - a fabulous book from start to finish!","I was ""hooked"" with the first sentence. The characters come alive and become people you really care about. I thought about them and the story long after I was done reading the book. Do yourself a favor and meet Natalie, Eden, and Max. Hiding Eden Rain is a book you will enjoy reading while relaxing in the sun or curled up in front of a fire. It's a wonderful blend of humor and mystery, and insightful, well developed relationships of the main character's family and friends. Experience this book and then share it with your friends."
5,Page Turner with Heart,"""A page turner of a mystery set in two very different locations, L.A.and a wonderful small town in America's Heartland, with a plot that willkeep the hammock reader guessing this summer.'Jean Eiss CaseyWriter and Contributor to the Penninsula Post, Door County, WI"
4,Very Good,Works great with my Coleman grill 3 of use camp all the time during the summer. I also have the cast iron grill section for the grill and that one is a plus.. The non stick works well careful with metal spatulas I do see some minor scrapes.
2,not user friendly,"We just bought the Road Trip Grill to add to our camping arsonal. We love it, but in attempting to use the griddle accessory, we found a major design flaw. It has slot-like holes all around the inside of the lip. So when the description says ""great for bacon"", I would not reccomend that unless you like grease fires in the morning with your eggs. We couldn't figure out why it was made this way, but I probably won't be using it for that again."
3,HappyCamper,This product would be better if it didn't have the open slots on the side for (bacon) grease and pancake batter to drip through; it would save on the clean up. Would prefer a solid design with maybe higher edges to prevent run off.
5,Its great,"I am very happy with the allsop mouse pad. It was well worth the money, I am very happy with it. One of the best purchases I have made. I also had a wonderful experience with Amazon.com."
4,Looks nice and works,If you're looking for an aesthetically pleasing mouse pad with durability and functionality then this is it. It's no state-of-the-art mouse pad but it works and after over a year of daily use the edges are barely frayed and it still works perfectly. Highly recommended if you're looking for a cheap nice mouse pad. Only con is the grip surface works great with the mouse but isn't the smoothest or coolest on the palm.
5,See me read...Hooray!!,"Lots of fun for a young reader. Technology, great visuals and appropriate language for 1st graders. My granddaughter loved using Grandma's kindle and was happy to show off her new reading skills."
5,I love love this book,Great illustration and good punch line. My 2 years old daughter enjoyed very much. She wanted me to read over and over again.
5,Hooray Rocks,I love the storyline of Lucy Cousins Hooray for Fish. I needed a copy of this book for teaching in my art classes. My kindergarden and first grade classes will love it!
1,they sent the wrong book!,"although they gave me a speedy refund. i ordered 'hooray for fish' and got a biblical counceling book. umm... not the same thing so i was very disappointed. will it stop me from ordering from hastings again, no but i will be cautious and only give them one more try. wish i couldv'e read hooray for fish... signed, bummed in tennessee"
5,Colorful book,"This book has great illustration. My daughter loves the colors. She's too young to understand the story, but I don't mind reading the story which is probably more valuable to me at this point -- I find parents should like the books because they are reading them, too!"
4,Almost Perfect,"We loved borrowing this book from the library so much, we asked for it for Christmas. But this version is didn't different! The ""gripy"" fish is now ""grumpy"" so the book doesn't rhyme completely (even though this line is quoted in the product description). While small, the change is puzzling and bothers the boys (and me, too)."
5,Hooray for this book!,"Our boys (ages 2 and 4) love Maisy books and shows so we checked out this book from the library when we saw it. They loved it so much we bought our own copy. It is a big, hard cover book with big, bright, colorful pictures. It is a happy fun read for them with lots to look at. Great for bed time or any time."
5,Hooray for this Book!,"I purchased this for my 2 yr old who A) loves Maisy the Mouse B) loves fish - so it was a no brainer! I found the book actually doing a search on Maisy and bought it on a whim. WE LOVE THIS BOOK! The illustrations are fantastic - bold, vibrant colors on a bigger than normal sized book. And the story is very sweet. Worth every penny and definitely a must for your children's book collection."
5,The first book my son would sit through.,"I went to a workshop at the local library on early literacy. This was one of the books the librarian recommended I try. This is the first book my son would sit through at 5 months. I tried other books every day, but could only get through a couple pages. We'd alway end up right back at Hooray for Fish.Positives of this book:- Bold colors and stark contrasts- Simple pictures- Great rhythmic text. ""Upside down and round and round"" ""so many friends, so many fish. Splash, splosh, splish""- There are a couple pages that could be search and find pages. ""Can you find a fish that looks like a pineapple?"""
2,"A classic? In a word, No.","My curiosity about Charles De Lint was piqued by the Modern Library readers' choice list of the 100 best books of the century. His name came up so many times, and I'd never heard of him. Even though the list was obviously hijacked by Scientologists, sci-fi and fantasy freaks, I had to find out: Is the mysterious Mr. De Lint one of the century's great writers? Guess what: He's not even one of the so-so ones. The premise of Trader is OK (hence the two stars), but the writing is pedestrian at best, adolescent and repetitive at worst. Oh well, on to the collected wit and wisdom of L. Ron Hubbard..."
2,No magic this time...,Just not one of de Lint's better efforts. An interesting start but never develops into much. Nothing new here...
4,Liked it with a reservation or two; great wisdom at the end,"I found this book a little overlong and rambling, but the culmination of Trader's NDE makes the book worth reading. There were also original explorations/treatments of old ideas: the Kafkaesque concept of waking in a stranger's body and mortals visiting Faerie, a.k.a. Tir-na-Og. I have sometimes felt critical of de Lint because I felt that he romanticized the homeless and other marginal members of society; IMO he is making that mistake less and less often as time goes on. That showed in this book. I also like the continuity of the characters that have appeared in other books."
5,I LOVED it.,"Although I can understand the other reviewers' points of view, I have to disagree. I loved this book. This is the first book I have ever read by Charles de Lint, but I thought it was entertaining and a really good read. I would definitely give it a try."
3,Could Have Been Better,"This was my first De Lint novel - I think that I am going to try another based on such high praise from others, perhaps this was just an unlucky pick. I did like the character Max Trader and felt there was so much potential for this tale, alas unrealized. Bones, Buddy and maybe Nia, okay. The other characters were uninteresting, whiney, undeveloped and just plain boring - way too much detail about stuff I didn't want to know."
4,Very very cool premise,"You'll either love or hate Charles de Lint. He never attempts to do anything other than entertain, however somehow I always come away from his books feeling as if I've accidentally learned something he is a storyteller through & through, not actually a writer, although he's had to stoop to writing because he just can't make a living traveling about the world and telling stories. In any even, this here story is so well crafted, with so much emotion packed into the characters, that Ifound myself dreading the ending... when I got within the last twenty pages, I started reading as slowly as possible. I wanted the story to go on... going to reread it."
3,Too much angst and melodrama...,"I almost put this book down three times in the first 100 pages. It was only the appearance of ""Bones"" and the Coyote subthread that finally kept my attention. Well, that and the fact that I've enjoyed others from De Lint's library of stories. His strength lies in his inherent story telling abilities. His weakness is wallowing in excess inner angst. Ultimately, I liked this story, but it did not merit four hundred plus pages. It could have been told in half those."
4,A little too tight,"I just bought this sleeve for my 15"" MacBook Pro. The quality is great, with nylon exterior and well-finished leather borders. The only problem is that it's a little too tight for my MacBook. Maybe it'll need some time to fit better. Great product though, protects the notebook really well!"
2,Certainly not the top of the line,"My previous, ""cheapo"" answering machine had a blinking red light that made it easy to tell if I had received new phone messages, but with this machine, you have to get within a few inches of the tiny, recessed LCD display to determine if you have any new phone messages. The process for recording an outgoing message (OGM) is cumbersome, the process for listening to your own OGM is even more cumbersome, and the sound quality of the OGM is poor. The ""film"" needed for printing incoming faxes is only a sample, and ran out after I had only received a few faxed pages, requiring an inconvenient trip to an office supply store. And, I'm still waiting for the rebate to arrive, 2 months after my purchase. Overall, I would rate this machine as OK, for a ""bottom of the line"" machine. I was mildly disappointed with the Sharp company."
1,JUNK - save your money and buy better quality!,"Like most of my reviews I try and find the good in any product, book etc, but ... This was a huge dissappointment and I partly blame myself for buying the low end/price fax machine. From the beginning through the 6 weeks it lasted we had trouble even after the first one died in a week and was replaced by the Sharp company. The second machine was just as problematic, slow and missed fax copy. The last resort came when the machine light indicator decided it was out of paper when it had paper, was replaced with new paper and never worked again. I also have to add that this machine was lightly used, perhaps a dozen fax copies a week. I find it interesting when a company wants to report that their fax machine doubles as a copier, who wants soft rolled copies?There is NO savings when a product is more trouble than it is worth, save your money and buy a better machine that has a better track record. Truly was JUNK!"
1,Only if you like solid black faxing...,"We bought this unit and had it for about 3 months before it started faxing and receiving totally black pages. It works as a telephone with caller ID, and thats about all it is worth. If you are smart, you WILL NOT purchase this unit!You get what you pay for..."
1,Worked Well for a Few Months...,"...then went sharply downhill after I changed the film. All sorts of strange error messages after a paper jam, and then, even though it was loaded with paper, the machine refused to acknowledge that there was paper and kept flashing that I needed to add paper.This machine was bought to replace a Sharp thermal fax machine that didn't last a year."
4,Wonderful,"This is a comprehensive dvd covering the creation to the restoration of Fallingwater. The expert commentary gives you all the information you've ever wanted to learn. My only complaint is that the dvd has almost no actual footage of Fallingwater. It is nearly all photographs, which is quite disappointing to someone like myself who have stared at countless photos, and craved to see (and hear!) Fallingwater alive. I would've loved a slow video walk-through when showing the home instead of step by step photos.Also Lynda Waggoner ends the dvd on a surprisingly negative note. Still a ""must-have"" for Wright fans!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this becasue it seemed similar to the ones you buy for 5 Euros in front of the Eiffel Tower. Not so. It is a more elaborate version of that classic toy, but it just doesn't fly well. Then after about the 10th attempt, one of the wings started to come apart. This thing was a huge dissapointment!"
2,clue used to attach mylar film to wing strut doesn't age well,"flew great three times and on fourth flight the wings kept beating after landing and the mylar separated from the wing strut.perhaps this particular specific item sat in a warehouse too long either way the adhesive needs to be improved.another thing to add to the ""to do"" list experiment with adhesivesthe second flight I took the instruction's advice and experimented with angle of tail wing--it did three loop-da-loops and then a graceful gliding landing.Most cool!"
1,A lot of fun until i breaks,Very pretty toy. My daughter could not wait to fly it but at first flight it broke a wing upon landing. I tried to fix it but it's so thin you cannot glue it (I tried) so I had to tape it. It doesn't fly very well now and unfortunately we have not been able to see it really fly. The plastic head will not pop back on fully either.
2,"Has potential, but disappointed","As a science teacher and mother, I was excited to get and help my young daughter with this after she saw one at a recent science show and wanted a Tim Bird. However, the crank is harder to wind than it should be, the wing paint scrapes off easily, even after the first flight, and our Tim Bird did not come with a spare rubberband drive mechanism as claimed. The wing came unglued from the frame after 3 flights; hopefully our re-gluing it will work. A little more field testing and refining before selling would make this educational toy more fun and less stressful."
2,Worked maybe twice,"This thing worked around twice, then just stopped flying in any meaningful fashion. It never seemed to land very hard, so I have no idea why it stopped working. Maybe I got unlucky and it landed wrong, but that doesn't change the fact I got almost on values from this."
3,bird,"This is a great product. We used it to help understand our bird flight. These are hard to find, but fine to play with as long as you are not to rough with them. My son used it to help get some ideas on how to do a science project about flight. My husband is actually the one that plays with it."
2,Fun for 10 minutes,"I've been through two of these birds. The first lasted for about 20 minutes of flying time, which was actually several months of use (average of 10-15 second flights). Then the wing brace separated from the wing material. The second bird's wing separated from the brace on about the fifth flight, probably about 10 minutes after coming out of the package.These fly fairly well and are fun while they last but I will not purchase another one due to the lack of durability during normal use."
4,Kids love it!,Fun for all ages. Use it in a wide open space because it goes high enough and far enough that you'll be trying to get it off of someone's roof if you don't.
5,Crystal Reports XI for Developers,"The book arrived in new shape and was work related. We are very happy, sorry it took so long for me to write this review. It is not because the shipper was late, it fact they were very fast. Thanks"
5,One of the Best Compilations,"This is a terrific New Age compilation. If you are unfamiliar w/ New Age music/artists, this is a great place to start. If you are an experienced New Age listener, this CD has the various artists best work. The KKSF Samplers always sell out in the stores (I have been trying to find volumes 1-6 for 6 months, in both SF and LA!)Lastly, part of the sales proceeds go to SF AIDS Foundation: great music and a worthy cause!"
2,Overpriced!,These cost $2.00 from the grocery store! No reason to buy online if you have access to a grocery store...
1,Broken!,"When I received this, along with several other items, I had grits everywhere! The packaging did not protect my grits. Now I am without my morning cheese grits for breakfast. I am going to try one more time."
4,Believe the Hype,This is a remarkable album. A unique sound accomplished through acoustic and electronic rhythms that doesn't sacrifice excellent song craftsmanship. The lyrics are well done and the singer has a great tone. The cd is a must have and the band will definitely be somewhere. The only question is are they as good live and when are they coming to Austin?
2,Interested in Dark Command? Don't get it with Lady Takes A Chance!!,"I gave this a two star because Dark Command was coupled with Lady Takes a Chance. The former I would have given a 3 or 3.5, but it is coupled with Lady... which I would have rated as a 1. Dark Command is an unusual movie, with well-known actors, and John Wayne plays his familiar good-guy role. We do LOVE Jean Arthur in roles we have seen her previously play in. However, this is definitely NOT a movie you would watch with your children and grandma. In Lady Takes A Chance it starts out with promise but quickly lowers to a grade C movie quality and the story line surrounds low class one night stand attempts. Not much subtlety."
2,Not what I needed,"I needed a question book that I could go through in a few days and feel as though I had covered the ""major"" areas and high-yield info that I had forgotten since medical school. This book has a lot of nit-picky stuff that isn't asked on the boards (at least not the ones I took a few weeks ago). Not very well-written either. Wish I had flipped thru the pages a little more carefully before I bought it."
2,yet another of those boring MCQ books.,There are a lot of books out there which overscore this one.The questions presented in the book are not at all up to the mark.After reading some of the questions i felt as if i can write better questions than these.Probably i should consider writing a review book for usmle step 3.The book is over priced too.The only good thing about the book is the very good quality of its pages and pictures.
3,How to successfully pass USMLE step 3,"I recently bought this book, by chance, thinking... one more book about USMLE. To my surprise, this book was reallllly terrific. It helped me a lot, was very clearly written.although beware : there are some mistakes in the pharmacology section !! The other sections were very helpful, especially for someone who has very little time to prepare for the test. So, don't hesitate, and order this book. M.M.M"
2,Poor documentation worse interpretation,"I read this book as a part of my masters work. THe author provides nothing in the way of documentation and the final analysis is nothing more than a call for future insurgency. While the reader can glean some useful facts about who the major figures and groups are, there is nothing here that is documented sufficiently to allow for critique or proper analysis. In short, a historically based piece of socialist propoganda."
1,80's excess!,"Although Mary Carol is obviously a wonderful women her design style is very dated. In all of her publications her ""layering"" techniques just say ""excess"". Todays style is all about simple pared down authentic living. The message I see from Mary Carol's books is all about excess a throw back from the 80's. Mary Carol really needs to bring her obvious talent to the new millenium and push the limit by learning the art of restraint."
5,A really useful decorating book,I have bought dozens of decorating and home design books but this is the most useful one I have ever purchased. The author gives you doable tips on everything from creating beautiful tableaus on end tables to grouping and hanging pictures. The text of the book is engaging and conversational. The photographs are just spectacular. This book would make a wonderful hostess gift for anyone who enjoys nesting and decorating her home
1,A bit dated and staid,"This book is pretty but I've been-there-done-that. I had hoped for some new ideas for my home (a fresh take on romance and tradition, which I love), but I did not find them here. The settings don't feel real to me. I want a home, not a stage set, and I need ideas for LIVED-IN style for my family and visiting nieces and nephews versus this kind of fussy, ""precious"" stuff. The style here is almost the worst of ""grandma's house,"" and I can almost feel and smell the dust. Yuk."
1,Rats....,"Some of the reviews sounded so good that I got this book. I was a little disappointed with the book because it seems to me that I've seen all of these ideas before. And I have seen them again and again. What the book shows has a dated look to it. A little too traditional and provincial for me. Maybe that's because I live in a city where I see more new ideas all the time or maybe what is shown, while not bad, is just aimed at a different and older reader.(Maybe amazon should print its reviewers' ages!)"
1,No sense of style here,There is no sense of style here. It is very predictable and low-brow. Nothing interesting or unique. I am guessing that anyone who likes this book is either very old or hopelessly lacking in any personal style sense. how sad
5,An awe inspiring book!,"Well, I AM older!! Mary's book is now the NUMBER ONE book in my decorating library! I have amassed quite a collection of books on the subject of decorting, but not a one is as inspiring as this one. I follow Mary's belief of 'there are no rules when decorating, just things you love'. Her rooms are 'not just another pretty face', but rooms you can live in, while also enjoying the 'scenery'."
3,Wont learn to photograph flowers here.,"Don't think that you will learn to photograph flowers with this book.If you want to learn this, it is not for you.If you want a beautifull book to look at, with good photos, it is for you."
3,Not the Book to Start With,This is not really the book to start flower photography with. I say this for several reasons. It requires elaborate camera and equipment. It deliberately teaches techniques that distort the perspective that one might have using their own two eyes.I am more of a purist and believe that Nature's beauty is everywhere and that it can be captured relatively simply using new and inexpensive digital cameras particularly those with image stability and macro functions built in.I published an entire collection of photos without any manipulation except cropping to fit the page. Matt CohenZen of Watering Your Garden
4,Looking at flowers in a new way,"The 100 or so photographs in this book are simply stunning and photography/author Tony Sweet shows the reader how he takes them. Each photograph is accompanied by a brief but comprehensive explanatory paragraph. Some have a set of step-by-step instructions. Sweet uses a variety of techniques to achieve these works of art but many of them are achieved with multiple exposures, slide sandwiches, filters and camera movements. Technical info, like types of lenses used and f-stop settings are also provided. In addition to technical tricks, Sweet also shows how he approaches positioning an object in the frame to achieve certain effects as well as achieving the best results with color contrasts. He also provides a list of the equipment (cameras, tripods, lenses, filters, etc.) that he uses as well as websites and addresses of the companies that sell them."
2,Not What I Expected,"I expected this book to be more of a training manual of techniques. Instead, every page is a photo with a VERY brief explanation of how or where it was taken, often without enough detail to recreate the idea. Although the photos are beautiful and Tony Sweet is a great photographer, the book is not at all what I expected. If you're looking for a photo book of his work, it's great, but don't expect to learn much from it."
3,Too stylized,"The pictures in this book are very beautiful, but I was hoping for more discussion of the basics of outdoor nature/flower photography, like lighting and composition. This book spends a great deal of time with mutliple images and zooming and ""special effects"" which are interesting but not really helpful if you are trying to take better pictures of flowers. Also, it seemed sort of repetetive at times."
5,Best I've Read in a LOOOONG Time,"I bought this used and have literally spent the last three days reading it. I couldn't put it down; and I attribute that to Mr. Leamer's excellent writing style and meticulous and unbiased research. I think it's amazing that almost forty years after Dallas there is still an incredible amount of drek and sensational junk journalism floating around the Kennedy family. This book seemed to be very well-researched and the highly readable prose made it a true page-turner.I was astonished at Joe Kennedy's decision to have Rosemary lobotomized; the passages about her in later years, especailly when her mother, Rose, tried to reconnect with her, were absolutely heartbreaking. That almost hurt my heart more than the more well-known murders and untimely deaths.I have come away with a new respect for ""The Girls"", Eunice in particular. What a remarkable family. And an excellent book. I recommend this very highly."
4,"Very long, but worth it","It is a long book, about 900 pages, but if you like the Kennedys, this is the book for you. Lots of details& gossip."
5,The Kennedy Women -- Saga of an American Family,"This is not a tabloid tale, but rather a psychological unravelling of America's Royal family. Far beyond the better known stories of Jack and Jackie, the Kennedy Women explores the lives of other lesser known family members and stories, from the relentless determination and success of Bridget Murphy of County Wexford, Ireland; to the untimely deaths of Joe Jr. and Kathleen, (also a member of England's Royal Family). The choices made by each generation and their individual willingness to accept accountability, clearly demonstrate that all families experience lives that are a complex tapesty comprised of the consequences of their decisions, the challenges of their generation, and the seemingly random joys and sorrows that touch us all. Even at nearly 900 pages, I couldn't put it down!"
4,Great Western Music,"Will Dudley is a great artist. Quiet, but his performances really grow on you. My favorite is his 'True Lies' album, but this one is great too."
2,One or more bad o2 sensor(s) out of 4...,"I ordered 4 - 2001corvette o2 sensor's and one or more has failed. The plug in read out I used does not show which one is bad, just that I have a bad o2 sensor. Less then 25 miles. Cleared the DIC and eng lite come back on. Will now have to spend $$$$ to find out which ones...There goes any savings....."
1,not real amber?,"I love the design of this earrings but I would question the amber part, looks and feels like plastic. This is why I gave only 1 star. Design is great, they look really nice and they add a little spice to Your outfit but what I appreciate the most in jewelry I buy is quality. The amber part in my opinion is not amber and I don't like being cheated. Seller advertises this earrings as amber... i wouldn't be so sure about it."
2,Poverty of Spirit Metz,This book was incredibly old and marked up. The binding is still good however and it is readible once you get past the underlining. The tag on the outside of the book is marked
5,Refreshingly original!,"Not a big fan of the fantasy genre, I was looking for an interesting take on things. After an hour scouring the bookshelves, I came across Rydill's Shaman and was intrigued. I was not disappointed! She has created a world of heightened reality grounded in familiar spiritual and religious metaphors and given it all a refreshing spin. Her characters are very strong, particularly Yuda and Annat, and it is this strength that carries the story."
3,well written first novel,"This is a very well-written and imaginative novel. I don't read a lot of fantasy but from what I know of the genre, this one has some refreshing elements. That being said, I only gave it 3 stars because for reasons I can't pinpoint, the book didn't totally grab me. While I wanted to read the entire book to find out the resolution of the story, I also had no trouble putting it down for several days at a time. When a book really has me by the throat I can't stop reading until I reach the end. Part of the problem may have to do with certain things one of the lead characters did that I didn't like and didn't think they had anything to do with the story. Without this prejudice, you may find the book more enthralling than I did."
1,Don't bother,"I picked up this book because the cover promised ""refreshing differences from the norm of fantasy"" However(much to my sorrow)different is not the same thing as ""good"" or ""a fun read"""
5,Lawless,"Im completely addicted to this album , its easily one of the best releases of a great year in 2005 . The production flows very beautifly and is mostly done by Magnif of Lawless Element , the lyrics are also dope but not as good as the beats , but the delivery and cadence of the rhymes are remarkable. It has some of undergrounds finest featured on this album , but its quite clear this is not a release for the average narrow minded underground fan , it has variety and enough skill to crossover to mainstream without even trying . I would say to any fan of good music pick this up."
4,A good cross reference guide book,"Each book can only feature so many great artists. Inevitably, many get left out. Here is a decent sampling. Interesting interviews. Wonderful photographs. I disagree with a price guide found in the back. We should encourage involvement in outsider art for its historical, social and emotional value, and not based on what a piece can fetch at auction, or how collectable an artist may be. The worth of a piece and/or artist is, or should be, a subjective decision."
1,Just to reiterate...,"If you are hoping to learn anything real about the 900 year old tradition of ninjutsu, do yourself a favor: Don't read anything by Ashida Kim. Follow the true path - Read Masaaki Hatsumi, 34th Grandmaster of the 9 Schools of Ninpo Taijutsu. Other reliable sources include Charles Daniel, Stephen Hayes, & Bud Malmstrom."
1,Ashida Kim is a fake!,"Don't buy any of his books! His real name is Christopher Hunterand he is definitely NOT a ninja or even a writer, for that matter. If you want a good laugh, look at the bizarre rants on his website... I troll there all the time! The only reason I gave this book one star is because ""zero"" was not an option. Ashida Kim refuses to fight in nhb, or anywhere else for that matter, despite his goofy $10,000 challenge, so I sincerely doubt that his books have any real techniques except those which he has plagiarized. The only legitimate ""ninja"" authority left is Masaaki Hatsumi in Japan. Invisibility? HAAAAAAhahahahaaaaaaaa! Why doesn't he ""disappear"" already."
1,Worst book on Ninjutsu written ever,"This guy is not Ninja.I bought this book and wasted money. If you want to learn Ninjutsu, buy books from Hatsumi sensei or Tanemura sensei. These are real masters."
3,Lackluster Customer Support,"I have found my Palm V to augment my daily life and help organize a very hectic schedule. However, the unit broke after three months and trying to get support is like pulling teeth. They do a good job of marketing and a lousy job of custmer satisfaction. Looks like I will take my business elsewhere in the future. I feel like I am dealing with a group of snake oil salesmen!"
4,I can't live without my Palm V,"When I first got my Palm V, I planned to use it as an organizer. With free, easy to use and learn downloads, however, it has become an essential tool for applications beyond calendaring and storing telephone numbers. My favorites are Avantgo, an application that allows you to download current headlines and stories from major newspapers and magazines, and Vindigo, a restaurant finder. I don't know how I ever lived without it."
3,beware the new serial port - old peripherals will not work,"One important con not listed above is that, to make this unit so slim, they changed the serial port on it. If you are upgrading from the older design, and you own peripherals (like the modem or a GoType keyboard) watch out. They won't work with this particular unit."
1,Palm V PDA,"The Palm V arrived in great condition from the seller, however, was not able to sync with our computer, very disappointed."
5,Some users need to know this,"I've seen reviews by users who claimed that to add in additional programs (.prc string)such as alarm clock or world clock, you need to spend another 25-30 dollars. You don't have to! There are virtually thousands of freewares/sharewares out there in www. I infact have quite a collection myself. Forget about all other PDA's, this Palm V is a gizmoz."
3,Very nice but not perfect,"Very good at what it was designed for... a better Day timer. Data entry easy to get used to. Sync'd the first time. Drawbacks however include a screen that is sometimes hard to read due to low light or reflections. Also the software which comes with the Palm isn't as good as the software you can buy from third parties. Why hasn't 3Com kept up. biggest drawback is price. $400 isn't cheap for a replacement for a $50 organizer... even if it is better. If 3Com can cram Palm features into a $250 model, they can wrap it in the slimmer case of the Palm V...when they do I'll buy it."
3,Not very Mac compatible,"Being a Newton devotee, switching to the Palm V was rather traumatic. However, I can not argue with the size and convenience. It is not very compatible with the Mac format, however, and I have as yet to find out how to download programs from the desktop to the unit. The writing recognition takes a bit of getting used to, however, the convenience far outweighs the minor limitations of the writing recognition system."
3,Not shock resistant,"A pretty good device overall, but one thing really bugs me. I have it in a leather case. I was carrying it in my hand one day and I dropped it. Only one exposed area got a tiny speck of a nick, but the rest of the device was cushioned by the leather. That incident caused all the screen touch points to drop. In order to activiate something, I have to touch below where it is displayed on the screen. The functions on the bottom moved almost completely out of range, and the writing area shifted down also. I can't tell if it's because the writing area shifted downwards, but the graffiti recognition is slower and less accurate too. I can't say anything else bad about it, but what a letdown to know that it can't take simple impacts."
3,SUMMARY: I'll stick with my Palm III,"I'm really grateful to amazon.com for providing these reviews, andto customers who have told me that the Palm V:1. Turns itself on in your pocket,2. Can't recharge on 220 volts without a pricey accessory,3. Has very poor support from 3COM once you buy it,4. Crashes alot for some users,5. Doesn't work very well with the Mac,6. Doesn't have enough memory, and7. Isn't backlit. (The palm III is hard enough to read.)I hope the people at 3COM read this stuff. If they do, and use the information, I'll buy a Palm VI when it comes out. I use the Palm III which is not quite ready for prime time, but the Palm V doesn't sound like it's worth the money.- Tom Donahue"
3,Mediocre improvements,"I have a US Robotics Palm Pro (we go back a ways) and have yet to find a reason to upgrade. The rechargable batteries are a drawback for me. In the Army I'm frequently in the field. Extra batteries I can take with me, but ain't no extension cord long enough for the LiON."
2,Imposssible with Windows NT 4.0,"I rushed out to buy a PalmV after reading all these great reviews, and find I can't use it!! For some reason despite the fact, the administrator has installed it (logging in as administrator), I can't access/use the Palm Desktop. It is definitely not worth the money if I can't link/synchronize it to my desktop!!! Does anyone have a fix? Is this a common problem? Would appreciate help. Thanks."
5,"It's FANTASTIC, but....","Folks: I'm sold on the Palm V, but I'm still using my old 128K Sharp Wizard. Wouldn't it be better to jump on the 3Com bandwagon by going ahead and buying a Palm VII?? Thought? Guidance? Drop me a note: rosselle@mindspring.com"
3,I like the Palm IIIe,"This Christmas I decided to treat myself to a Palm computer. After reading the specs on the Palm V and the Palm IIIe, I decided to buy the Palm IIIe. It seems that the only differences are about $200, the Palm V has Flash RAM making it upgradeable, the cool look of heat blasted anodized aluminum. I got a soft full-grain black leather case, which makes the Palm IIIe look as cool as the Palm V. I feel that the Palm IIIe is more portable because you can get AAA batteries anywhere and do not have to rely on the cradle / charger. The funny thing is that I'm still using my Casio SF-4985ER Digital Diary with 256 KB memory for my electronic organizing needs."
1,Palm V,"Item is obsolete. Although the item appears new, even after complete reset, it is very difficult to use the stylus to perform all functions."
3,"Small, dear, less powerful than IIIx",Bought Palm V and was disappointed to learn that Palm IIIX is more powerful. It is very small and easy to use. Leather cover does not prevent buttons being pressed in your pocket. For a mere $40 can buy keyguard similar to what comes on $10 calculators. Palm VII only offers connectivity but costs quite a bit to stay connected so only buy if someone else pays your connection fee. Overall very nice to use but needs a key guard for less than $40.
3,HotSyncing between Home and Office,"I've had my Palm V for two days now, and I've found out that they don't like to be sync'ed on two different computers.I originally installed my Palm V at the office, and when I brought it home (after buying an extra cradle,) the hotsync failed during the mail sync'ing. When I emailed 3Com, with the all the information regarding software/hardware, they sent me an email back asking questions that I had already answered.Other than that... it's great!"
3,Problems With the Palm V,"If you look at the Palm V and the Palm IIIx you will notice some major differences. First of all, the V is smaller, and looks cooler. However, the benefits end there. The V has half the RAM of the IIIx, which, as a seasoned pilot user, i know you will really want if you get into modems and telnet shells and mail and real-time web browsing. (not to mention games) I would suggest forgoing the looks for the functionality (something that is not done enough in our corporate world) and getting the IIIx. You will not regret it. However, if you have to have something shiny, by all means, this is the machine to get...."
3,"Great style, but an important flaw","I finally decided to spend the extra $$ for the Palm V and give my old Palm III to my dad. Afterall, I loved the styling, but more importantly wanted the slimmer size.Unfortunately, when you use the hard cover that comes with the Palm V and put it in your pocket, it causes the power button to turn on and then the up/down key constantly clicks. Huh?So then I went out and got the hard case (a rip off if you ask me), causing the Palm V to be just as thick as my Palm III. That left me wondering why I bothered spending all that extra money to get a Palm no smaller than the one I already had.Dad, can I get my Palm III back?"
3,Sexy looking but not the best value,"I admit I'm not the best judge, because I own the IIIx, not the V, but I have a friend who owns the V, and I just thought I'd share the fact that I don't regret my decision. For $100 more, all the V gives you are those (admittedly fabulous) looks. The III-series Pilots are already pretty lightweight (dunno about you, but my *wallet* is thicker than my Palm Pilot, and not because I'm rich), and the IIIx screen is very readable -- an improvement over the old Palms, including the old III -- and only a shade less bright than the V's. What the V does offer you is less memory, no way to expand it, and no way to re-juice your PDA on the road if it runs out of gas and you don't have the adapter, an outlet or the time to recharge; I don't think a $3 pair of AAA batteries once a month is an exorbitant expense. I am a diehard devotee of all Palms, and you could hardly go wrong buying any of them, but I think the IIIx is a smarter first-time purchase."
1,Palm V,The shipping and receiving of the Palm was adequate. However the back light didn't function. I e mailed the seller about the problem but never received a reply.
1,Pocket PC is the Way to Go,"For a comparable size and price, the Compaq Aero 1550 has far greater functionality and 16 MB memory. The Aero is a Pocket PC and has a voice recorder, audio jack, MS Office software, and a Compact Flash port."
1,Bad Quality,"Im quite dissapointed with the Palm V , because it not even been six months and the green power button on the top to switch it on , does not work. I have to push it hard and push it several times before it comes on. I hope they fix the fault soon, cause I will not buy another 3com product again till they fix this."
4,Consider spending the extra money for the Palm Vx,"I recently purchased a Palm V, it is the best time mgmt. tool I have owned. The only draw back is the memory capacity, the V was my first organizer so I was not sure how much memory I would need for all my office activities. I know now, I want MORE MEMORY!"
3,No match for the Newton,"I think that while this product does have an obvious size advantage over the newton, the software is not as elegant, the solution to handwriting recognition not as handy, and the features not as ground-breaking. A wonderful product, but I would rather have the newton any day."
1,This unit is junk...,"This thing keeps crashing on me. I've lost my data on 4 occations. And don't bother to call tech support cause they shove you off the phone without any real help. (help desk hun,I don't think so) I waited for 25 minutes on my dime just to get told to reinstall the soft ware when my unit was not accepting data. What a joke. I got my money back and bought a sony.."
5,Love Palm - Hate the Cases,"i just got my Palm V, and I really love it. this is my first PDA and i was able to use it fairly quickly. i love the freeware/shareware available for it. two complaints i do have... 1. that ""metal"" case that 3com makes is really cheap. avoid it like the plague. i broke down and dropped $70+ on the Rhinoskin Aluminum case and it is the best. i totally recommend it. 2. if you are buying the Palm V, just go ahead and buy the PalmVx. I mean really. i have filled 3/4 of mine already and i don't have much on it (Avant GO eats up a bit of space, so does Vindigo if you live in NYC)."
2,"Good product, but very poor client support","I agree that Palm Pilot is a good product. It did help me have everything properly organized... while it lasted. I had a minor problem with it four months ago, and I have been completely unable to have it repaired. Client support numbers won't answer to phone or email requests. Technical support is just never available. I have not been able to use my palm pilot for over 4 months. The product might be good, but I do not think it is worth taking the risk of ending up using your old paper agenda."
1,Bad unit,"Apparently when it works this is a great thing to have! I got a bad unit and did everything to get it to work properly, but the unit simply did not work and froze all the time. Called Palm, they were very eager to replace it with a refurbished unit, which is no bad but not what I expected or paid for. I bought this for convinience, but has only been a problem and a waste of my time. I am not giving up yet though, I have asked Amazon to replace the unit. Will see what happens!"
5,almost everything is in your palm,"Paml V is my first handheld device. Because of its beautiful design(the size and the weight mean a lot to me), I bought it when it just came out. Regardless all the other Palm models are available on the market, I love my Palm V, and highly recommend to others. Of course, you should get Palm Vx for more memory power. I left my four address books, note and appointment book in my closet. My Palm V goes where ever I go. It is also my alarm clock now."
2,Where's The Beef?,"Like everyone else (I guess) I was seduced by that small bullet colored case that could fit in my shirt pocket. The conventional wisdom said that if you want a PDA, get a Palm V. At first I was excited but then saw that you could only do a few essential items and the screen was impossible to see. Also, the buttons always get mashed when it sits in your suit jacket so that the battery gets wasted. When I saw a friend's CE based PDA with full color and multimedia, I started surfing for one of those. I hope Palm beefs up the processor and the screen to come up with some less drowsy applications--then they'll really have something. Until then, I think they're doing Bill Gates a favor."
2,Problems crashing,"I bought a Palm V from Amazon and thought it was defective because it crashes consistently. Every time it has been left off for more than twenty minutes, it requires a soft reset to get it going. I thought it was defective and asked for a new one. The second unit Amazon sent me does the same thing. Does Amazon have a bad batch or does this seem like a consistent problem with others?"
5,Best thing I ever did to organize my life!,"No more sticky notes, no more paper reminders in my pockets. I use it to keep track of everything, from check book balance to grocery list. Great product and the memory is more than enough for day to day use. The hard casing makes it more durable and the size allows it to fit in your shirt pocket. I recommend it for anyone who wants to really get organized and never miss an appointment."
3,"It's the same screen as the palm IIIx, and less RAM","If you like the silver case on the palm V, and you think that is the reason to buy it, then go ahead, but you will later be wishing that you had bought the IIIx, which has the same screen (watch for streaking problems), more memory and takes all the same accesories as the rest of the palms/pilots. The V has then fancy case, and the rechargable batteries, but not much else over the IIIx. If you want to look slick with the IIIx, you will already (when you get news and email and web pages right in your hand.) And you will be much happier with the larger capacity of the IIIx also. (just a hint)"
5,An Adult Pacifier,"The Palm V is one of those electronic gizmos you don't think you'll ever need, and then when you get one you can't live without it. I've been carrying mine around like a pacifier. When someone stops me on the street and wants to set up and appointment I used to take their number and check my calendar back at the office. Now I can take their number AND make the appointment.3Com has packaged a proven product in a sexy case and come up with a real winner."
3,Slim and rechargeable but touch-screen wears out quickly,"I've owned a Palm V since Feb '99. In the last 5-6 months, the sensitivity of the screen has severely degraded. I have to write very carefully, or my Graffiti isn't recongnized. I also have trouble with other on-screen controls, like scrolling or marking a checkbox. This has made the V very difficult to use. Because it has worn out so quickly, I don't think I'll replace it with the same model--I'm going to look at the Handspings.On the plus side, you can't beat the size of the V. It's very slim, fitting easily and inconspicuously in the pocket of your pants--even your jeans (as long as they aren't slim-fit!). The recharging cradle is also a bonus. You never have to think about batteries."
2,Stylus problem,"The Palm V has all the features I would like but I hesitate to buy it because the stylus is too stiff and difficult to pull out and use. Unless this small but important feature is rectified, it continues to be a sore point for women like me - I have broken my nails trying to use my husband's Palm Pilot V. In the meantime, I will treasure my old version."
5,Good for Pippa Guard Fans,"This is a hard to find film which showed on American television around '92 or so. It's a British mystery movie or who-done-it. The lead actress is Pippa Guard, a seldom seen actress I like very much. I found this film ""used"" here at Amazon and at a good price so I promptly ordered it from its seller. Not a moment too soon, as the price for the few available copies has soared."
2,disapointing,"The book was disapointing. Material is not organized by the level of difficulty. Very simple sentences and phrases are placed next to gramaticly advanced ones.""Grammar notes"" provide a few very basic grammar rules and are inadequate for the level of gramatical dificulty of many sentences.The majority of the patient interview questions and recomended phrases are either irrelevant or simply inappropriate.Buy this book if you want to learn the names of the body parts in Spanish, but do not expect much else of it."
2,"Title should be ""paper flowers"" not ""origami"".","If you are looking for a craft book on making paper flowers, you will enjoy this book. The word ""origami"" has more meaning in it, and as I got it expecting ""origami"" I was very dissappointed.Don't be put off by my low rating if it is what you want - it seems like a nice book for the subject it covers."
5,In my top 10,"This is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read. Very well written, great character development, and if you like mermaids then this book is a MUST for your collection."
2,"Mind you, I have yet to finish this...","I'm only about half-way through this smallish novel, but I think it's safe to say that I wish I had read the previous review before purchasing. Until Lord Alexander entered the scene you wouldn't have known the story involved vampires at all. Most of the characters are decidedly human-acting, which is not a problem if you're trying to make a realistic character...but come on, this book is about VAMPIRES - the non-realism is already established with the very genre.Also, the main character of Rosamund is unfortunately simpering and weepy - not at all what I was hoping for when I think of a seductive Toreador courtier. If I have to read another description of her eyes ""filling with blood tears"" I think I'll just stop altogether."
5,very good hip hop from l.i. new york,"I love this artist because he had slamming beats love ballads and party joints like the greeks in the house, I used to party hard in philly greek picnic in 80's and 90's but if u can get this lp or cd it is a undergroud classic peace out."
2,Yawn! (It's a very *nice* book.),"Before you buy, make note of page 11. ""The management at Balmur Ltd., Anne Murray's company, as management so frequently does, when someone proposes a biography of their talent, informed me that 'Ms. Murray will not co-operate with any biographer at this stage of her career.'""Barry Grills does his best. The book is half description of Springhill, Nova Scotia (Anne Murray's hometown), and half lengthy quotes from back issues of magazines and newspapers. As he says himself, ...""Anne Murray has always been an enigma.""If you've just discovered her talent, this is a good outline of her public life, up until the mid 90s. If you're already a fan, more than ever you'll want to go to Springhill, to see the Anne Murray Centre for yourself.As for Anne Murray--she's still an enigma."
3,Missing the bride/sexual connection,"An interesting edition to the many books that have come out on Mary Magdalene. At times the poetry on being alone seems to apply more to the author's human condition than to Mary Magdalene. Also it is disappointing that the author has left out the the sexual connection of Unity. Still, all and all an interesting read -- Although this would not be the book I would recommend to someone as a first read on Magdalene."
1,Oh brother...,"Based on the description of the book I was really looking forward to reading this. And though the author has a talent with writing, to say that it was channeled by Mary Magdalene is misleading. Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute (The author needs to reread her Bible to see how this title has been a misnomer throughout history that even the Catholic Church no longer supports) and the supposed affair between her and Judas was a bit out of line; given the role that Mary Magdalene had in supporting the ministerial efforts of Jesus who clearly downplayed any emphasis on the body. I hope others don't get fooled into believing this is truly Mary Magdalene's story."
3,Good performance marred by bizarre camera work,"A well done performance but marred by the camera work. Camera shots change every two or three seconds. The video director must have thought that viewers would be bored longer shots. And as in rock videos, you frequently find yourself zooming out and in for no particular reason. Too bad. Otherwise would be more highly recommended."
4,GOOD VALUE,"THIS PRODUCT IS ALOT NICER THAN THE BRAID OF GARLIC HANGING IN YOUR KITCHEN! IF YOU USE ALOT OF GARLIC, GET THIS!REHYDRATED EACH PIECE IN COLD WATER UNTIL SWOLLEN TO CORRECT SIZE. YOU MAY SLICE OR DICE BEFOREHAND.ALL I USED BEFORE WAS GARLIC JUICE IN THE SPICE SECTION OF THE STORE -- THIS IS A MUCH NICER PRODUCT!LINDA"
4,deceiving description,"Very easy to assemble. However, I am disappointed that ""it no longer comes w/a wire mesh floor"" as described. I have been advised to get a galvanized screen from the hardware store."
2,Animal problems,"It was quick and easy to assemble. But it's rather slow to compost materials (and, I'll be honest, I don't rotate it much - it's a nuisance to do it). But the big problem is that small animals either knock off the top, or chew holes through the part where you can take the compost out. And they create quite a mess in our yard. Next time, I'll get an ""off the ground"" version, and perhaps a tumbler that I can turn with a handle."
2,Disappointed,"Quicky delivery of this produce and assembling was easy. Definitely a 4 star on how it fits in my yard. Doesn't take up a lot of room. Disappointed tho in the lid of this composter. It doesn't lock in. The two swinging doors on wach side of the lid have terrible hinges - very flimsy. The big problem? When you go over with your kitchen or yard scraps to dump in, the swinging door doesn't stay up. So you need a free hand to hold it open which can be a real pain if you have a heavy pail full or cumbersome yard scraps. Really not worth $99."
1,My Experience So Far; UPDATED,"The composter I purchased from Gaiam arrived incomplete; in fact it was missing several pieces. I contacted the manufacturer of this unit (not Gaiam) and no one returned my call. I then followed Gaiam's return intructions, which were fairly clear but which cost me $35 FedEx to return. I later received an email from Gaiam explaining that they received the composter and that a new one would be coming to me in December. Apparently they were out of them at that time (11/13/2008).UPDATE: the new composter arived on December 1, earlier than promised. The unit is in fine condition and complete. I am very satisfied with it, as well as Gaiam's quick response to this problem."
2,Really not worth it,"I purchased this plasma display after my Phillips FlatScreen fell off the ceiling. The resolution is comparable to most high-definition entertainment systems, but you're obviously buying this for the kitchyness of owning a 42"" ""plasma"" something. I would certainly wait for this technology to advance a couple of years before dropping this amount of cash."
5,I love this machine!,"fast, sharp, clear printer. easy to install and use anybody can use it , even my dumb sister can use it. wow!"
4,Could of been better.,The book has lots of good phrases that range from easy to difficult to play. Biggest drawback is that everything is in the key of C. The author tells you to transcribe the phrases yourself but it would of been very helpful if they were written in different keys in order to teach the fretboard better.
5,cool case,"This case is great for my cd player, cds, and headphones. It has plenty of room for stuff."
4,Rechargeable batteries,"Batteries have been working great, holds charge as rated. will order more when needed."
5,Excellent Batteries,"The Sanyo ""low-self-discharge"" NiMH batteries represent the state of the art in NiMH batteries. I've had nothing but good luck with them and will continue to buy and use them...you should too."
2,"Sanyo 2,700 rechargable batteries","Recommended to me by a friend but have been dissappointed. Two of the batteries do not seem to hold a charge very long. I should probably have returned them but was out of the country and did not get back in time to do so and not lose out. Don't know why the leader does not say it was an Amazon verified purchase as it was, most definitely purchased from Amazon."
1,Overheated,This batteries would always overheat seemly no matter which brand charger I used. They overheated so bad I was afraid to leave the home or go to sleep with them in the charger. They now live their life in some recycling center.
3,Really? Cure for everything.,"I read this book with great interest but was somewhat dismayed to see he has a cure for everything except broken bones. Guess I don't need doctors after all with this book. I'm somewhat skepical, can you tell?"
2,Had potential,"At first glance, I was very excited about this book as I am a firm believer in natural remedies. But it quickly became apparent that this book was in support of the authors proprietary blends of natural remedies. That's just a pet peeve of mine. I was looking for a book that offered practical natural remedies that don't require purchasing a specific product line."
2,Stay on topic!!!!,"At first I found this book interesting. I'm devouring all the info I can about 'alternative' remedies and a more natural approach to health. But when the author started spewing his rage against homosexuals, it got ridiculous. I mean, he didn't just state his case in scientific terms and move on. He felt the need to REPEATEDLY explain how the only natural sex is between a man and a woman. The hate he harbors for gay people was readily apparent in his words. I'm a straight woman so his rant wasn't directed at me, and I'm not easily offended by personal opinions that differ from mine, but I found the author's blatant hostility toward homosexuals SO ridiculously hateful that I lost interest in reading any more of the book. Luckily I borrowed it from a library and hadn't actually paid money for it."
3,Sloppy Transcriptions,"Of Metallica's first 5 albums, this songbook probably suffers the worst from transcription errors. The first printing of the book was released less than a month after the album was, so if you consider the time it took to transcribe, typeset, edit and get it printed, this was a rush job. The Unforgiven suffers the most in the book in terms of accuracy (the verse riff is so very wrong), while Sad But True has a few problems as well. Is anyone ever going to transcribe the eerie micro-tonal slide part of the chorus?I don't know if subsequent printings have corrected some of the errors or not, but I do know that Guitar For the Practicing Musician (who were involved with the early Metallica songbooks) did release a 'Metallica Special' magazine that corrected the Unforgiven and Blackened (from AJFA), as well as a corrected version of Sad But True in their monthly magazine."
5,Awesome Metallica learning source!,"If you are a Metallica fan and play guitar, then this book is a must! Learn all of Hetfield's Rythym and Hammett's solos. I learned more than 90% of this book's song already-with ease."
1,Not correct tabs!,"I have read about this book on amazon, it saying in one review that the tabs were not correct. i payed $25 for this book in a well known guitar store in a big city. I tried to play ""unforgivin"" and it did not sound like the song while playing to the cd. i looked in my ""easy guitar"" metallica book from 1992 and it has the correct chords. I haven't played any other songs yet but for unforgivin the song is incorrect."
3,Interesting,"It's interesting to see this book 50 years after first written and to see what has (and hasn't) changed in the experience of an ex-pat family in Tokyo. The book simply contains several vignettes of life in Japan, as portrayed by the author's cartoons and captions. Interesting and amusing but not comprehensive or insightful enough for me to give it more than an average rating."
2,"This Book is ""Okay""","I bought this book last week (first week of October, 2010) and I think this book is okay for a person like me. What I mean by that is you have to know basic singing before reading this book. If not, you might not understand due to the terms and the demonstration."
2,Not for the average reader,"Call me simple, but I had a hard time gleaning anything useful from this book. I was able to understand a few of her points, but mostly I was just reading words that I couldn't quite grasp or put into use. I would recommend ""Great singers on great singing"" by Jerome Hines. That has alot of valuable information from some of our favorite singers."
5,Alt country fan,"Uncommonly fine songwriting and vocals - really - sensitive, intelligent, musical! The pedal steel work is exemplary. There are some rhythmical ""hiccups"" on this self-produced recording. But these folks deserve MUCH positive attention - go Bellyachers!"
3,Pretty Silly,"This is a pretty silly collection of no-name synth pop artists covering OMD songs. Most of them sound like they were recorded in home studios. I would only recommend this for hard-core OMD fans, like myself. :-)"
5,The Bible in 90 Days Participant's Guide: An Extraordinart Experience...,O.K. this book will help me do what I haven't been able to do for a lifetime. I am looking forward to reading it.
4,You cant go wrong with this great value.,"Nakamichi,that says it all.What a great value on an outstanding piece of audio equipment.I unboxed the AV-3s,proceded to unhook my old Luxman receiver and was listening to it shortly after.The AV-3s has all the power one could want and the clearity is just what one would expect from Nakamichi.I am more than pleased with this receiver and would tell anyone shopping for one to check this one out..You cant beat Nakamichi,and you sure cant beat this value. Thank You"
4,"high quality, low price","The AV3S is an excellent product at a great price. I've always loved Nak products, at the same time being put off by their price and reliability. The 3S has addressed both my concerns (price is reasonable and I've had it for over a year now, with no problems). The remote is somewhat poorly designed, but works well, and you can even control the center channel and rear surround settings with it."
4,still sterling after 2 years,"It would be nice if I could decode the latest digital video standards, but that's about it on complaints. Considering the extremely reasonable price, this is simply the best receiver I've ever had.It offers astonishingly clear sound (with my 5 ohm Magneplaners and a/d/s/ sub), plus plenty of inputs and outputs, and all around versatility. Simply superb. Even more importantly, whenever I want to do something, I just reach for the analogue buttons and dials and it happens. No perusing the manual. Try that with a Yamaha or Denon.Note: this receiver is no longer produced. However, the current Nakamichi AV-7 is almost identical (but with more video inputs), and the AV-8 and AV-10 combine extra features (like a built-in crossover and DTS decoding) with the same amazing usability.The best receiver-family going. Get one, even if you already have a McIntosh or a Mark Levinson. You may be very surprised by which one you actually use."
5,The authority on the JFK assassination issues an updated edition ...,Jim DiEugenio is in my opinion one of the authorities on the JFK assassination. I purchased & read the original version of Destiny Betrayed many years ago and looked forward to this updated edition. It doesn't disappoint as it is full of new & expanded details. I also listen to Jim DiEugenio on Black Op Radio frequently; and this book puts in writing some of the concepts he has explored there. Mr DiEugenio is not an extremist. He does not accept every conspiracy theory surrounding the assassination ... only the ones with merit & can talk about those in depth. This volume is a treasure chest of information & will prove to be an absolute must source for anyone interested in the Kennedy case.
5,Outstanding Work,"Mr. DiEugenio has outdone himself this time. After reading the 2nd Edition (with new information courtesy of the AARB), one cannot help but realize that Oswald was an innocent patsy, that darker forces were behind the plot, and that once Garrison uncovered some of the key elements of this fact, the ""powers-that-were"" saw to it that his investigation and trial was dismantled. Great read!"
4,Second indictment forthcoming?,I strongly suspect that Ruby was a key conspirator and I was disappointed that the author omitted any reference whatsoever to his attorneys [Belli and Tonnahil]. Didn't both attorneys have witnesses who could prove that both Oswald and Tippit were former patrons of Ruby's sex bar? I'm still hoping that at least one subsequent indictment stems from DiEugencio's text.
2,no nazis no good,Any reserch that does not include the nazis is either misinformed or part of the cover up....its all about oswalds nazi and white russian contacts...
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this and was excited to get it. I hoped to use it to smooth my hair and provide volume at the root. It turned out to be very cumbersome and didn't seem to get very hot. Even though I have straight hair, I found it difficult to get hair taut and even around the barrel. It had very little effect on my hair at all. I even tried hairspray, which I don't normally use. If your hair is easy to curl, it may work for you."
1,Paper jammed every time,"We bought this fax because of the price with the rebates. You could send faxes easily, however we could never receive a fax without having to hand feed the paper. Not everyone is standing next to their fax machine when a fax comes in. Even though it has a memory, that will not do you any good when the paper jams more than once and it looses your fax. The machine would say ""out of paper"" when fully loaded. It would also crimp, or tear, the edge of each piece of paper it printed. We finally returned it and are now in the process of shopping for a new one."
1,useless for incoming fax or copying,"Paper will not feed into machine, or if it does it will jam.Machine worked perfectly for about a week and since has beenuseless except as an extra telephone. Poor quality."
1,Remake d'un film Franais(LE GRAND CHEMIN),"Pourquoi ""Paradise"" n'a pas eu le succès attendu pour laquelle vous ? ? ? - par ce qui est le remake d'un film franais qui si l'appel (appel) ""The Big CHEMEIN ET DE L'OMS est nettement UPPER "" Le Grand Chemin "" - Christian"
3,Nice little romance movie,"Both actors do a credible job here. And the subject matter is so true and believable, you'll be caught up in the story and rooting for the hero and heroine all the way."
5,GREAT FORGOTTEN FAVORITE,"I saw this movie in the early 90's. I rented it from a blockbuster. It was such a good movie!! I can not stress enough how much I loved this film. Throughout the years I would remember this movie every couple of years and look for it at local stores, but, would never find it. I was surfing the net one day and thought about this movie again and decided to look it up. I FOUND IT!!!!!! I was so happy. I just ordered this and I am anxiously awaiting it's arrival. I told my wife all about it and I can't wait for her to see it. It is a very well made FAMILY movie. Do yourself a favor and BUY this movie. It will be enjoyed over and over again."
1,Disappointing,"I was unable to play this DVD because it said that it could only play in region 2 or 4. The USA is region 1, so some how I ordered the wrong DVD. I didn't try to play it until I'd had it over 30 days so I asked for the DVD made for USA. I asked after the 30 day deadline,so gave up. If you could ever get this for viewing in the USA, it is a very sweet story. I have it in VHS."
4,PARADISE LOST was PARADISE FOUND,"I first saw this film when I was in my early teens. The same philosophy applies to movies that you saw when you were a kid until the next time you saw them, perhaps as an adult. I located this movie through the IMdB - (the best internet database for movie discoveries, actors, etc.). This movie is a classic piece of a disturbed marital relationship that is rekindled by a summer guest, (Elijah Wood), who thus restores Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson's passion for one another. If you enjoy drama, true-to-life matters, but on a more quiet scale, then perhaps you will enjoy this one. Not the same movie I once thought it to be, but it also restored my own passion for the peace it offered."
1,"These things melt, don't waste your time.","Smith Victor says these lights should only be on for 30 Minutes. Fair enough, they have a plastic casing around the bulb. Well, ours melted after about 20 minutes. We turned them on to burn off the obnoxious smell that is inherent in all new lights. They were being kept outside due to the toxic fumes that were coming off of them. One light began melting and smoking then a second. We shut off the third before it entirely melted around the bulb. These lights had been on less than 30 minutes. So unless you want to through away $470 bucks, don't buy these lights!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I'm disappointed in this game because it just seems like Zoo Tycoon 2 recycled. Same format, same controls, same items, same clicking the same patch of dirt a hundred times to keep your animals happy in their environment. I actually bought this game because I was looking for an alternative to Zoo Tycoon 2, which I just don't care for. Instead, I got virtually the same game that I don't care for, and already own. The only major difference is in this game you have to raise your own meat, fruits, and vegetables for food and create your own water supply. Do zoos really do this? It just seems like busy-work to make an already mediocre game even less fun. Hard-core fans of Zoo Tycoon 2 might like this, just for the addition of the growing-your-own-food component, and there is also weather in this game. Other than that, I don't see any big difference."
2,Not much fun,"Nice graphics, but we didn't like the game much overall. Tasks were boring, sometimes you just have to wait when something was happening on the screen and watch animation, sometimes you just move the objects around. Control panels were too complicated and didn't give many options at given time."
4,Wildlife Zoo pc game,"This game is very fun and can be played at any age. There is endless hours of creating enclosures, caring for/training animals, setting up parks with attractions, and even missions that can be quite challenging."
1,Haven't been able to play it!,"I have better than the ""requirements"" BY FAR and it is still not running. The main screen has glitches, and when you load a game or try to play anything, it shuts down. On the rare occasion that it loads a game (1 out of 30 times trying) it crashes as soon as you try to do anything!"
2,I wouldn't work for our computer,"I bought this game for my son thinking it was like Zoo Tycoon, but we were unable to load it on our compter. It wouldn't download for some reason. We had a Windows XP, and later we got a Vista, but even that wouldn't let us load it. We never got to play this game, and since all the paperwork was thrown out, we couldn't return it either. We also contacted the company, and they couldnt' help us either. Don't waste your time on this game, you might have problems loading it too."
3,confusing,These accessories were a little hard for me and my daughter to figure out what they were. She is 3 and they didn't translate to her.
3,Average book with a sub-par printing.,"For a book that costs 54 dollars, I don't feel bad when I say that it's not in its favor to have pages that look like they were copied with a really bad coping machine. On the other hand, the content is OK, it's average, I think McGrawHill has a variety of different books centered around the same theme and Lee is the series editor (""Directions in Second Language Learning""). The book is concise and the chapters are short, but the only real reason you would want this book over the others is because it's on the syllabus.Short version: Horrible printing, average content."
4,To love someone but die in the end,"Here are two more films of John Wayne that are thrillers. The Fighting Seabee's is of course a war film set during WWII. Good cast in this film too. It tells of a women's love for one man and another man at the same time. Double troble if you ask me. Formation of the naval unit called Construction Battallon or Sea bees as it came to be knowen, is told by the members of a civilian gang of workers. They go to war on Island X to build airstrips and oil storage tanks. In the end one man dies (Wayne) the other marries the women who is a reporter for a newspaper. In the other film, John Wayne portrays a sea captian sailing the South Sea's. The time is approx. 1840's. It too is a love story but with much suspense at every turn. Both films are in black and white but this one is a good sea story. Action is all part of what happens to the ship and later to him (Wayne). I know that if you get these two films, romance and surprise are in store for you. Good films over all."
2,Not my favorite,"I've used many guitar books over the last 15 years and I usually LOVE them. This one started off too advanced with hard to follow exercises, hard chords. The exercises got easier instead of harder, so the sequence seemed unnatural. I couldn't find fingering for the left hand, or not in logical place anyway. I personally didn't like this book, but others seem to like."
2,Mediocre,"There are now tons of contemporary fingerstyle resources out there. There's even a dedicated magazine. This book goes a bit fast for true beginners and offers nothing to anyone else. The music is mediocre and the teaching is typical. I'm a full time teacher and I've reviewed hundreds of guitar methods and this one was disappointing. It isn't awful, but you can find better easily. I really recommend skipping this one.Note: I have yet to review the intermediate and master level books and they might be better. Steve Eckels, the author of the master level, is a superb author and guitarist. This review only applies to the beginning book."
2,"Slow Freight, Overloaded With Blandness","""A Good Cup Of Joy"" is touted as something to do with the guitarist relationship with coffee...it's a shallow concept. This guy needs a producer who is willing to criticize and add to his ideas. It's not that that he is without any talent, but left to his own, Fuentes just doesn't explore the potential of his material. This album gets a ""B"" for boring."
2,Technically adept but boring,"Typical of this CD's low aim and artistic laziness is the corny play on words ""A Good Cup Of Joe."" The vague expression of contentment with a cup of coffee, voiced listlessly by the technically adept but boring Joe Fuentes, is perfect for the office-ready smooth-jazz radio format and little else."
1,Audio Equivilent of Prozac,"A Good Cup Of Joe could not even keep an insomniac awake--this is one sleepy recording. And quite frankly, I felt it was the audio equivalent of Prozac. The level that this music does work on is as background music or a cure for insomnia (if being bored to sleep can be considered a cure), but for upfront listening, there was nothing that made me want to pay attention to the music for very long.Fuentes does get a nice tone out of his guitar, but there's a side of me that wishes he'd cut something with a little excitement to it. All of the tracks on this album run at the same slow pace, there is not even a single up-tempo tune to act like a mild dose of caffeine amidst the sleepiness.He seems like a decent guitar player, and I know he does have potential, but the subject matter just makes the whole thing rather empty and uninteresting to me. Maybe I just like my 'Cup Of Joe"" brewed a lot stronger."
1,Lukewarm Smooth Jazz,"Here is yet another entry into the Smooth Jazz sweepstakes...a collection of less-than-engaging music by guitarist Joe Fuentes. Much of the disc follows the tried and true Smooth Jazz formula...drum machine groove, synth accompaniment, and rather benign melodies. Audio wallpaper, but not good for much more."
2,Purification System,I did not know how to rate this product. It was a gift for someone and they have not used it yet.
5,SteriPEN System Pack,This will keep the big little things from floating in your water. Only works in clear water.
2,Product failure followed by unacceptable warranty,"IrReceived a Steripen Adventurer for Christmas last year and was THRILLED, since I travel abroad to developing countries several times a year. I used it in Fiji for about 20 liters. Then I used it in Nepal on the Annapurna Circuit. 5 days into the 17 day hike it stopped working. We replaced the battery but it still did not work. We were forced to scramble to find questionable water purification in a remote Nepali village. While this was inconvenient and disappointing, I knew the product had a warranty. When I returned home I discovered that replacing/repairing the product UNDER WARRANTY required me to pay $7 plus shipping to AND from the warehouse! So it cost ME $15-20 to fix THEIR malfunction! This is, of course, in addition to the issue of having the product fail at the most inopportune time. i emailed the company to express my dissatisfaction with this policy. It has been 3 days. I have received no response."
1,Hardly works!,Purchased this item excitedly for our trip to Brazil. Out of the box it ceased to work. I used pricey 2900 Mah rechargeable batteries and it probably worked twice before quitting and flashing a red light. The company refuses to offer a refund.
1,Loved it...until it broke,"We used this for about 5 backpacking trips and loved it because it is lighter than a pump and you do not have to sit at the water source (full of Mosquitos). But on our last trip, it stopped working - the constant red blinking light. We replaced the batteries with no improvement. We waited until later in the day when the batteries were warmer - no improvement. The suggestion made in a comment to another reviewer that water from snowmelt is too pure and he should have added salt is interesting, but if that is the case, there should be a warning in large red letters on the instructions. If you are bringing a water purifier, you need it to be reliable. By the time you bring replacement batteries and iodine tabs as back-up, it is not really any lighter than a pump and far less reliable. I do not recommend this product. Should be zero stars, but that is not a choice!"
1,Good... for a while.,"I was out on the trail for four days. This was my only water purification system and it worked great for three days. The pre-filter was fantastic. It collected things I couldn't even see, leaving a brown film on the screen. The SteriPEN is supposed to give a green light when complete. On the fourth day I started getting red lights. The UV light came on for 5 seconds and then shut off giving a red light. The batteries were brand new. I took the batteries out and then put them back in. I dried the unit off. I dumped the water out and put new water in... Red light, red light, red light. I got on the trail an hour late that day and probably ended up drinking some non-purified water. I cannot recommend this product."
2,Overrated and Pretentious,"Adams covers the same info that Conrad and Baker discuss but with a tone of condescension and puritanism that blankets the text like a fine scum of oil over water. Halfway though the book I wanted to curse him; after listening to his boorish and uninspired NPR interview I wanted to punch his lights out. If you like feeling superior, this book is for you. Otherwise stick with Conrad."
1,Way Out of Date,"As far as pension industry books go, anything published over two to three years ago can be considered obsolete. This being published in 1992 missed all the changes that have affected 401(k) and pension plans, especially EGTRRA. You are better off finding something either written in the current year or something written after 2002."
3,Dollar store Batteries?????,"I dont have anything bad to say about these batteries so far. they are doing their job in my sons glow worm as of now. My husband however said, ""what the heck! these are the kind they sell at the dollar tree, hope you didnt pay too much""my fault?worth it?$2 value seeing there is double what comes in the packs at the dollar store but now i kind of feel ripped off because he said thatwish I didnt knowmake your own choice on the matter."
1,Poor Product,"I bought this for the laundry room kitty litter. It does not pick up well at all! The darn handle comes off a lot, despite banging it with a hammer. I do not recommend this product. If you want some power, buy a smaller plug in vaccume."
3,A handy helper,"I never thought that I would be buying something that my mother used when I was a small child! However, one doesn't always need to vacuum and this is a very handy item to have in one's cleaning repertoire. Now there's no need to dig out the vacuum cleaner for those quick clean ups of carpets and wood floors. It doesn't pick up everything, but it does a pretty good job on most things. I notice that the flatter the debris (the little pieces of paper that escape when emptying the cross-cut shredder, for example) the harder it is for the brushes to pick up. But on the whole I'm really content."
1,"Not a ""Perfect Sweeper"" by any means","I purchased this sweeper based on other reviews. First of all, the handle would not stay together no matter what I did. They could have at least had the parts all screw into one another. I found that the sweeper picked up hairs and dust, but not the crumbs or dirt. I had to keep going over areas where my son had crumbs and it still would not pick it all up. I ended up having to get the broom and dustpan out like usual. For $30.00 this thing should pick up crumbs. I guess I'll just have to find something else. Don't waste your time and money on this."
3,Better than a broom,"The handle really does fall apart. I give it a good push down before I pick it up and it usually holds together long enough to get it out of the closet, but the handle design is just bad.It will pick stuff up fine IF you push down fairly hard while you're using it and if you have enough room to give a few full strokes back and forth over the area. In a very tight space I haven't had much luck.Think of it as a very fancy broom with a built-in dustpan and you'll be thrilled with it. I like the fact that it doesn't throw dust back in my face the way the hand-held vacuum did. But don't think of it as a replacement for a real vacuum cleaner - it's just not that."
3,Sweeper,The sweeper is good for light pickups.I had trouble with the handels coming apart.I had to wrap them in tape to keep them together.JB.
3,Review of Bissell Perfect Swweeper,"Easy to use, and picks up pretty well. I had a hard time learning how to empty the collected dirt holding section, and it opens pretty fast, making it easy to spill if you aren't careful. Probably will be better after repeated use. Nice to use between vacuuming, and quieter."
2,Not good.,It's a waste. I bought it for my hardwood floor. It's very noisy. Can't pick up dirt very well.
4,Good Enough for Quick (carpet/non carpet) Cleaning,"I have a carpet floor but I didn't intend to have this product to replace my vacuum cleaner. For light floor surface cleaning, rather than uncoiling the cord of my vacuum cleaner - I just pull this out (sweeper) and start running over (to pick up) lint fibers, bits of papers, small beads, wrapper debris, and others similar to it. And it works fine. Of course, for deeper cleaning, use vacuum.My rating is four star otherwise five. The only reason to be four star is the size (kind of big) which is not really a big deal for me for it serves the purpose of why I bought it. But pricewise, it is five star. There is a similar product made by rubbermaid which is smaller but the price is twice. At any rate, be careful with the handle - either Bisell or Rubbermaid or other similar products.Well, I have to wait for more than four months so I can give a better review about this product."
4,very convenient,Great for picking up stuff tracked in from outside. I have a 10 month old who picks up every speck of dirt or piece of lint she finds. This allows me to do a quick clean up with out dragging out the vacuum. I can also clean around her with the loud noise of the vacuum which always made her cry. The handle did fall off a few times but I just wrapped some black electrical tape around it & I haven't had a problem since.
3,No substitute for a vacuum cleaner,"It picks up middle sized particles OK, but if it is too fine it does not do a good job. Not bad for a quick sweep over a small spot. But it's no substitute for a vacuum cleaner."
3,Handle separates,"The handle has four or so pieces that you join together to make a long handle. I had to tape each segment together to keep them from coming apart when I use it. Once I taped them, I found that the sweeper does work - it is quiet, lightweight, and is a quick way to sweep up. Emptying is easy."
4,Simple and effective Perfect Sweep Dual Brush Sweeper,"If you're like I am, I don't like to have to drag out the vacuum cleaner every time I need a small clean up in the kitchen or basement.The Perfect Sweep Dual Brush Sweeper is completely portable, lightweight, and gets the job done. It works best on carpeted floors with a light nap, not so well on heavy shag. It does fairly well on tile and wood floors, but the brush mechanisms were best designed to work on carpeted floors.The feature I best appreciate is the non-electric sweeper action; fewer parts to go wrong, and a lifetime warranty to boot! You can't get that with an electric model.It is simple and effective, but I give it 4 stars for it not being able to work on all styles of floors easily. Yes, it will clean, but not without more effort than on a flat carpeted floor."
3,Good for a quick pickup instead of always useing my vacuum.,"The bissell carpet sweeper is great for quick pickups, BUT the handle constantly falls off when picked up and it is very annoying. I have tried different methods of trying to keep the handle together but nothing seems to work."
3,NEEDS SOME IMPROVEMENT,"Although the sweeper picks up pretty well, the handle fell apart every time I tried to sweep with it. I finally duct-taped it together and as long as it holds, I can use it O.K."
4,Quick clean ups,"I keep it by the door and it really helps keep the grass, hay, dirt and other stuff our shoes and the dogs bring in every day between vacuuming from spreading all over the house. Not real good on long carpet, but works fine on indoor / outdoor carpet in the entry way area."
2,needs a better handle!,I can't agree more with the review that said the handle was awful. It works just fine for a brush sweeper - if you can actually get it to go back and forth a couple times without the sweeper pushed away from you and the detached handle in your hand. I actually like the idea of hot glueing the handle and think I will try that on mine. Maybe it will be more useful to me
3,Vacuuming Impaired,"I purchased the Bissell 2680B Perfect Sweep Dual Brush Sweeper for those in between vacuuming moments to help pick up my Chinchilla droppings. This item does what it's purchased to do, however I do have difficulty keeping the handle together. No matter what I do it seems to come loose after every moment of sweeping. Not that big of a deal, just a bit annoying at times. Overall it does pick up what needs to be picked up and it does keep the carpet looking fresh between vacuuming days."
2,A good idea in theory; cheap handle broke the deal for me,"I was so excited about ordering this (sad, I know!). I liked the idea that this vac was human-powered, and that it would allow me to do quick clean-ups between regular vacuuming.I was disappointed at how cheap the handle was, and how easily it came apart. Basically, in order to ship the thing in a small box, the handle comes in 3 pieces. You have to put them together -- the round tubes just ""slide"" into each other. Unfortunately the pieces are not threaded, and don't stay together terribly well. If I had a really old vac that needed to be held together with duct tape, that's one thing. However, I'm not keen on having to duct tape brand new things.The pickup was okay, but not great. After a few passes, there was still dirt on my tile floor. It occured to me that I had not found the magic vac of my dreams, so I ended up sending it back."
3,Nice for a quick clean up,This is a good sweeper for those quick little touch-ups but it is not a replacement for the vacuum.
4,Just like grandma used to have...,"I have found this to be a great inbetween vacuumings tool for quick pickup. We have a cat, but she does not shed enough for me to comment on how well this picks up fur.It seems pretty sturdy, and by pounding the handle together before screwing it on, I have avoided the fall-apart problems that other customers have identified.We are satisfied with this product."
2,Not what I expected,This sweeper underperformed. I tried it on my carpet and it didn't pick up much of anything not even scraps of paper. I bought this precisely so I wouldn't have to pull out the vacuum but this does not do the trick. I will be returning it. Waste of money...for me anyway.Thanks
1,really bad design,"This product falls apart every time it's used. I ended up taping the telescoped handle together to prevent this, but the place where the handle meets the sweeper could not be taped and it falls off every time! The worst is when it's carried from place to place and the sweeper head come crashing down onto the floor pretty hard. This type of action can cause dents in wood floors, cracks in ceramic tiles, or damage to feet. I definitely would not recommend buying this product. I should have gotten my $ back right away, but I thought the pieces would come to fit better after some use, but it only got worse!"
3,Very bad handle,"Although I am pleased in the performance of this sweeper, the handle is very badly designed, and comes apart every time I pick up the sweeper -- making it extremely frustrating to try to use. I would not purchase this again (unless the handle is improved)."
3,Bissell 2680B Perfect Dual Brush Sweeper,"This product is NOT at all perfect! It does not do well with pet hair or lint on a carpet. The debris trap must be emptied much too often and when it is nearly full, it will deposit the debris you just picked up back onto the carpet! Not a good buy."
3,Not so much,"I bought this because I have two cats and litter tracking is a problem. Both litter boxes are set up in a bathroom with tile floor. The vacuum cleaner is so noisy and I wanted a less stressful (to the cats) way of sweeping up the spilled litter. Forget this sweeper. It picked up some of the litter but just managed to move the rest around on the floor. I ended up having to get out the vacuum anyway. Maybe it's good for carpet, but don't buy it for sweeping up after pets."
2,not impressive,"Doesn't work well on hard floors, or thick carpet.The handle broke after a few uses, probably because you have to push it so hard and so many times to pick anything up."
2,Sweeper,It may pick up dog hairs but that is all it does. My carpets looked just the same after I had used this numerous times.Cannot compare this to a vacuum cleaner at all. I am very disappointed in this sweeper.
4,Great little sweeper,"For those who have an active family that is always tracking in dirt, pine needles, saw dust, etc,,this sweeper is great. I use it for everyday sweeping and on area rugs between vacuuming. It's not the best at picking up large pieces but is GREAT on pet hair. Keep in mind, this is not a vacuum, just an alternative to a broom, it won't get everything. There is no plug, there are no batteries to replace, just your own pushing power.To keep your sweeper working well take off the rotating brushes frequently to clean out any strings or hairs that have gotten stuck. (especially on the pegs where the brushes attach) It makes a big difference."
4,Easy and Fast Quicker Picker-Upper.,"I was pleasantly surprised when I tried the Bissell on dog hair, cat hair and kitty litter. It picks it all up! No longer do I have to drag out the 12.5 amp Kenmore when the kids drop crumbs on the floor. We have low pile carpet and linoleum and the Bissell works great on both. It fills up fairly quickly if you have a mess to clean, but it only takes a few seconds to empty the machine.My mom had a similar machine 40 years ago and I can see the improvements Bissell has made over the years with dual rotating brushes. Also, I can use it when everyone is sleeping as it makes no noise compared with my old handheld Boss Stick handheld vaccuum. The Boss died and when I tried to find a battery for it, I found it would almost cost the same to replace it. So I checked around for a cleaner without battery or electric power and I found it with the Bissell.I recommend the Bissell to everyone who does not have High Pile carpet. It works well on low carpet and bare floors."
1,DEFECTIVE HANDLE DESIGN RUINS PRODUCT,"The handle for the Bissel Sweeper is made of 3 parts that you push together and come apart everytime you pick the sweeper up. Even a cheap $13 sweeper at Target has a screw-together handle. But neither Bissel, nor Amazon, apparently tried this product out before they made it and sold it. It's practically a crime to advertise you can save space by hanging this sweeper up -- since each time you pick it up the large metal head separates from the handle and crashes right on the floor (leaving dents in wood) or on your foot (and making you curse at it). Should be a ZERO star product."
1,not worth the effort,"These sweepers used to be worth their weight in gold but with the newer models, they just aren't worth the dirt they pick up. They work fine on a low carpet - not very well on a hard floor. Your time is better spent with a broom and a dustpan. One strong WARNING: the handles have no way of keeping themselves together so every time you push, the base goes flying across the room. Unless you are willing to invest some time and energy in going to the hardware store for a couple of self-tapping screws and drilling some pilot holes to secure the handle, then don't even bother. This sweeper is an exercise in frustration at best. Don't let the name fool you, the ""Bissell 2680 PERFECT Sweep"" is anything BUT ""perfect."""
1,not good at all,This product is way too old to be on the market. And it is not perfect at all. Connections are weak and become reconnected at any move- it is very complicated and makes you angry and disappointed. Do not buy.
2,Not enough pickup,"The Bissell 2680B Sweeper is nice and quite when using.It picks pet hair up nicely on carpet and on tile flooring.The handle often comes undone during use, since it is only plugged into the actual sweeper compartment.Overall sturdy built but fails to pick up bigger crumbs on Laminate or tile flooring.It just seems to push the dirt around."
3,Bissell not quite Perfect Sweeper,"Not bad, however one drawback that I encountered, for this sweeper is the handle. It comes in 3 parts, which have to be pushed together, and sometimes there's a tendency of it to come loose, when you lift the sweeper off the floor."
5,The best $25.00 I ever spent,"This is an excellent carpet sweeper and the best monies I ever spent. I bought this because we care for our 14 month granddaughter a lot,clean carpets are a must since everything on the carpet ends up in Lexies mouth. This is great for quick clean ups, is so easy to use and light weight. I have breathing problems and a vaccum sweeper is very hard for me to use. this carpet sweeper has been a dream come true.."
2,not the bissell of my childhood,"I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO LOVE THE BISSELL, BECAUSE IT NEVER FAILED TO PICK UP THE DIRT WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO LOVE PLAYING WTIH IT. IF ANYTHING I THOUGH IT WOULD BE BETTER. BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT COULD NOT PERFORM AT ALL. INSTEAD OF THE DIRT GONE IN, IT ACTUALLY COMES BACK OUT. ALL I WANTED IT FOR WAS TO USE IT IN BETWEEN ELECTRIC VACUMING EVERY DAY. IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY $30.I WOULD RETURN IT IF IT WASN'T SUCH A HASSLE TO DO SO."
4,A Great Carpet Sweeper,"This sweeper does an impressive job of sweeping my carpet and it's definitely nice not having to plug it in! It was especially nice when I used it to pick up the needles that fell off of the Christmas tree. Only a couple of complaints: The pieces of the handle seems to fall apart easily, so I am thinking about gluing it together so it's all one piece. The designer must have made it that way for easy storage. They should make the handles more like the Swiffer handles which snap together with holes and buttons on each piece. Also, one flap on the bottom of the sweeper that is used to empty the dust compartment gets stuck sometimes, but that might just be a problem on the one I received. I am able to get it unstuck, so it's not that big of a deal. I know once I get the handle glued together that I am going to love it and use it all the time!"
4,Bissell 2680B Perfect Sweep Dual Brush Sweeper,"My mom has a cat that gets kitty litter everywhere so this works great for fast clean ups, its easy for her to push around and it does a great job.It also is easy for her to empty it which is great for the elderly.Thank you,Mary Jo Kelleher"
4,"Nice Unit, but lacking in a few areas.","The JVC kaboom box sounds very nice, at least for the $$ I paid for it. My only crticism of the unit is that the FM Tuner could be a lot more sensitive (for those of us who live in remote areas), and the ACS feature makes the music sound noticeably blotchy (very annoying). Apart from these problems, as well as its bulky size (which may be impressive to some), the Kaboom box is an awesome unit. Definitely worth the money."
3,"It's good, but not perfect.","Don't be fooled by the other reviews if you are looking for supreme performance. If you are looking for a good portable boombox, then this is definately the best option. If you are searching for true sound, you are far from it here. While the bass is resonant, it is hardly consistent with the rest of the equalization, not to mention quite muddy. Don't use the ACS feature. It just makes the sound blotchy. I purchased one and am satisfied, but i still wouldn't agree with those reviewers proclaiming this machine as one to be worshipped. Also, while being one of the sturdiest boomboxes available, it is still quite fragile."
5,The loudest one can buy for the money,"When I first saw this little boombox, at first, I laughed really hard. But when I listened to Korn on this compact unit, it picked up all the low notes. With 40 watts to the 6-1/2"" subs and 12 watts to the 3-3/16"" full-range speakers, it will fill your room up with toons. To me, this is the best mini system ever!"
5,"Yeah, what those guys said!","If you look at the power delivered by most portable stereo and boombox systems, you will be amazed to find that they rarely exceeds 30 watts. Some products are even more disappointing in delivering less than 10 watts. This boombox blasts out 52 watts of continuous power. An added bonus - Amazon.com is selling them for less than most on the web. In fact, I paid more :("
2,Not Worth the Price Paid,"I bought this stuffed animal organizer for my kids' play room. It is very cheaply made for the price you pay. Instead of clips to hold the toys, there are elastic bands that don't stretch very well. Because they don't stretch well, it makes it very difficult to hang the stuffed toys on the organizer. It is very flimsy and small. My husband and I were very disappointed when we received this product! I would never recommend it to anyone."
5,Great item,"I was a little leery that this ""tree"" would really work, but it does!!! The height makes it hard for my daughter to get the smaller toys on top, but her having to ask me to get them down helps me to keep a handle on the amount of stuffed animals that are out as she has to put others back before I'll take more down. I had no problem getting the loops over the tops of large animals, but I could see where a child might. Until my daughter is strong enough to do it herself, I'll just do it. The tree was really more for my sanity that for her. The only concern I have is I've been telling her to never put anything over her own head or around her own neck, yet I'm telling her to do exactly that with her animals. I'll just keep reinforcing that the loops won't hurt the toys but could hurt her very badly. Other than that concern I think it's well worth the money!"
2,doesn't do well on carpets,Found that the item is too unstable when using on carpeted floors. Furthermore it becomes top heavy when putting too many animals on there. A better solution would be to hang a chain from the ceiling.
2,Not as good as it should have been,I bought two of these lights for a photography class I was taking. The first one went together fine but the second one was useless. The holes in the bracket were not tapped right so the screws that hold the whole thing together would not go in. I emailed the seller but got no response. So here I set with a useless pile of parts.
5,Lovely lovely,"Having bought all of Simple Minds first albums in late high school/early college years, and feeling dismayed by their later ""anthem-stadium"" efforts, I was thrilled to see these records(Reel to Real, Empires & Dance, Sons/Sisters) released as CDs. I can't really decide on a favorite song, though In Trance as Mission, and Careful in Career especially resonate. Along with the earlier two albums, Simple Minds at this time had a great feel for the postmodern angst of the isolated reflexive self, and with that the desire for human connection brought on by globalization. These songs capture well the unreal feelings of living at the end of the cold war, hopeful despite the overarching threat of annihilation. The compositions are innovative and haunting, Jim Kerr's vocals and phrasing innovative and, though at times unpredictable, absolutely breathtaking. This is still a group that understands voice as part of the instrumental whole."
4,"A bit of a mixed bag, though I did enjoy reading it from cover to cover!","This book is part of the Dark Horse series of Star Wars Tales book. Each book contains a series of short graphic stories set in the Star Wars universe, with each story having been created by a different team. Now, as you might expect with such a book, there is a broad range of styles in writing and in illustrating the story.I must say that I enjoyed this book as much as I have all the other books in the series. My favorite story was Resurrection - where a group of Dark Side adherents resurrect Darth Maul, and send him to replace Darth Vader - it had a fascinating story and was excellently illustrated. Namesless was probably my second favorite - it told the story of how Darth Maul came to create his interesting double light saber - though the illustration work was not nearly so good.I enjoyed my time reading this book, even the stories that were not my favorite, and I don't hesitate to recommend it."
3,improve your reactions,"Fun training tool for basketballers, baseballers, soccer goalkeepers and any sportsperson who needs to sharpen their reflexes. The one flaw is that it isn't as durable as it looks, after just one day of use my one already has little holes and scratches on it."
4,The Book of the Ancient Greeks,Great historical research!!! It would be a great history book for highschool students. Because it was written so long ago it might be a little boring for grammar school students.
5,VICENTICO VALDES/SONORA MATANCERA,"In 1958 the New York City based, latin music label ""Seeco"" decided to team up their two top recording stars in a recording session at the legendary Radio Progreso studio-theatre in Havana Cuba. Vicentico Valdes,a cuban bolerista living in New York City since 1949, traveled to Havana to join the equally famous Sonora Matancera in what is considered an all time classic album. Vicentico had previously recorded with Sonora Matancera for ""Seeco"" during a previous Havana, Cuba tour in 1953, about four 45/78 rpm singles were recorded then which left fans ""asking for seconds"", so the 1958 re-encounter was welcomed everywhere. Ever since its release in late 1958 or early 1959 this album, now on CD format has been a best seller. ""Los Aretes De La Luna"" was and still is the most internationally acclaimed and successful bolero song from this great compilation, followed by ""Lo An~oro"" and ""Solo Por Rencor"". A must for all afro-cuban music lovers and collectors."
4,Good Product Good Price,A really good product it saves a lot of storage space but the top cover could be made to look nicer though.
1,Depends on what you are looking for......,"If you need a calendar of when your bills are do, this is great. It is not what I wanted as you cannot put in separate credit card info and keep track of expenses like you would in another software program. I wanted something a little more in depth that I could customize as far as the bill names and put in interest rates, etc."
3,Love/Hate Relationship With This Toy,"It comes apart (basket and seat)easily which is annoying when the kid first gets it because they bug you to fix it constantly. Later though the kids enjoy dismantling it and using it themselves, especially for the highchair function). Not a great daycare toy as it tips over easily and can harm babies crawling nearby."
3,Don't bother...,"I would give this toy 1 star but my daughter really loves the pretend food that comes with it. I, however, find this toy to be extremely annoying. The baby seat and the basket come off the base way too easily. I probably reattach them over 100 times a day."
3,It is fun but the construction of it needs improvement,"I agree with the other people who say that this item comes apart too easy and that the baby is hard to get in and out of the seat. Whenever my 2-year old uses this cart, it is alway disassembled after she plays with it and I have to put it back together each day. The banana is great and so is the milk carton but the other play store items should be more child proof. It is fun but requires a lot of daily maintenance to keept the both the baby seat and the cart on."
2,Very Flimsy!,"We bought this cart for my daughter's 3rd birthday -- she loved it, but it was a piece of junk! It kept falling apart while she was playing with it. Granted, the pieces are supposed to come apart, but it was becoming frustrating for her. Plus, for the price, it seemed very flimsy. Several of the ""play food"" items were cardboard boxes...you can guess how long those would stay in tact! We ended up exchanging this cart for the Little Tikes one, and we're much happier with it. It's way more sturdy, and cuter too!"
4,Good product,"This toy is fun and has so many features and things to play with. The only complaint I have is that it is a little more flimsy that it appeared on the picture, and my 1 year old has flipped forward with the shopping cart tumbling over while pushing it a few times. Now, she doesn't even like to push it that much, but likes to put things in and take things out of the basket. The handle is not a very durable plastic. It gives a lot if the child leans on it a little too hard. When making the purchase, it said that this is for children 1-3 years old. However, when we received it, the box says for 2 years and up. Other than that, it is a great product. It comes with so many different neat items and is a very reasonable price for what you get."
2,Cute but not of good quality,"We gave this to my 18 month old daughter as a Christmas gift and thought it was really cute on the box. It really lacks sturdiness but she finds it enjoyable to push around the house. The cardboard boxes are so flimsy I'm not even sure they lasted a whole day. The banana, muffin and milk carton are fun to play with. Our twin 3 1/2 year old boys love this cart as well. They run through the house and it winds up crashing and coming completely apart. That's a boy thing! The seat for the baby is too small for a standard size doll to fit into and be taken out without this seat coming off the cart. The idea of this cart is cute but overall I'd look for something with more guts to it -- something that's made better and will not fall apart when you look at it."
3,Flimsy,"The cart is too light and the ""food"" that comes with it (other than the banana and the milk carton) are cheap carboard boxes that our daughter flattened in 5 minutes! Cute looking but the Little Tykes one is way more sturdy for little ones to hold onto!"
3,Fun for a While,"I bought this shopping cart for my 14 month old daughter who absolutely loves her Little Mommy doll. She enjoyed taking the food out of the shopping cart but when she tried putting it back in the basket fell off the frame and she got quite upset. Also, at her age it is difficult to get the doll into the seat portion without assistance from mom. The cart itself also does not turn well when tried to walk with it."
3,Lots of fun...,"My girls love this cart, mainly the food that comes with it. We have the highchair too and the two make a great pair. I recommend this cart for alot of fun and a little peace for mom while the kids have fun playing with it."
5,A good buy,"My daughter got this from Santa last Christmas when she was almost two and she still, almost a year later, plays with it everyday. She loves it and it's easy for her to use. The seat for the baby can also be like a high chair. It was very easy to put together. It helped for her to have her own ""baby"" while we were expecting her little sister a few months later. The Little Mommy dolls are excellent too."
3,Needs too much assistance!,"Cute idea and not a cheap item although it's not worth the $ and if I had the choice to purchase this again, I wouldn't! Last Christmas it was #1 on Santa's list. Christmas Day and there after my 4 y.o. was upset over and over b/c the dolls doesn't fit into the booster seat easily and the cart also comes off too easily. I would rather take the time to take apart the cart for my daughter than put it back to it's original state every 2 minutes! Plus, the flimsy cardboard boxes are a joke! They ended up in the trash by the end of the first day. However, the milk and banana were a clever idea and are still played with a year later. The actual shopping card has been collecting dust for quite awhile!"
1,Buy a cheaper one that your child can't take apart...,All my 2 year old does is take off the seat and the basket. Buy one of the old fashion carts that your kids can't take apart. It sucks
1,Get something else,"This toy looks cute but the same day we put it together, my 2 yr old daughter took it apart. The pieces were all over. Buy something more sturdy that your child can get some use out of"
2,"Fun,but not sturdy enough","My daughter received this last week and today for the third time she leaned (very lightly,I watched) onto the basket to take something out.The basket came off and my daughter fell hitting her lip on the basket.Also ,if she gets too excited the cart constantly tips over.It is very entertaining,but if there is one more ""accident "" I will take this toy away from her.This is the second ""Little mommy ""toy I got (I got the bath doll,which falls all over in her ring)and both of them are fun,but extremely lack quality."
2,piece of junk,My daughter loves this cart but it falls apart so easy. We ended up taking it away because the basket and baby seat would fall off and she'd cry. It was very frustrating for her.
1,very poor quality,"This looked like the perfect shopping cart IN THE BOX. However, the features of the removable doll seat and shopping cart are the downfall. The pieces come off so easily that my daughter gets very frustrated. Not to mention how frustrated I am that she constantly is asking me to FIX IT! I am going to return it ASAP!"
4,Perfect for my two year old,"I bought this for my 2-year-old daughter and so far she loves it. She especially loves walking around talking on the little cell phone while pushing her baby in the cart. Even my 4.5 year old son enjoys pretend playing with the milk and the banana is very cute. I was contemplating buying a stroller for my daughter who loves to push around her babies, but this seemed like a better alternative and so far I think it was the better decision."
2,not worth the money,"My 18 month old daughter received this as a gift and we've been completely unhappy with it. The basket comes off very easily and causes her to fall if she is leaning or pushing on it. The baby seat also comes off easily, but is difficult for a toddler to remove a baby doll from. This is very frustrating to our little girl. The accessories are very cute, but the overall product seems very poorly made. We bought the Little Tikes shopping cart and love it!"
2,Not sturdy and hard for kids to use,"I requested this cart for my 2 yr. old last Christmas - it's cute and ""goes with"" her dolly, but I really wish I'd asked for a more sturdy cart. She likes that the basket separates, but the handle is so flush with the basket, she can only put smaller things in it. I thought it'd be fun that the basket and seat detach, but they are difficult for a child to put back on and she has to ask me to do it. Plus, both of her dollies' legs get caught in the seat so she can't get them out either. Most of the food things are cardboard, which I yes, laminated with packaging tape, and they still did not hold up. The banana, milk and dish are cute, but I don't think they warrent choosing this cart."
1,Not worth the time,"Criticizing other's interpretations of the sutra is not the way to expound your own understanding (or lack of it) of this classic yoga text. Yoga is a practical science, not an academic exposition of your point of view. If you want to gain a working, practical understanding of the sutra to deepen your own personal practice, try a translation by one of the Indian interpreters such as I.K. Taimni."
5,Aiwa has a great product!,Unbelieveable sound for a great price. Light weight and comfortable. Purchased the radio with a gift certificate. Made a wonderful gift!!!
4,Great deal!,"I bought this walkman and didn't expect such a great performance from such a cheap walkman. Great sound, slim as an audio cassette. If you're looking for a great deal, this is it!"
4,a little tonk with your honky,"Not the acidic honkytonk you might be expecting from our Deadly Snakes vet; Ethier seems to have spent more than a few lonely nights with a bottle, a pack of smokes, and Dylan's ""Bringing It All Back Home"" roaring, coming out on the other side with an excellent blues/folk/rock record only a drunk white boy could conceive. Forget about the obvious borrowings from Dylan (and even Tom Petty!)--if you are going to rip someone off, it might as well be from the best, right? We aren't talking about mind-blowing originality, here; we're talking about great rock and roll. Buy it, burn it, and give it to the masses!"
4,Part 4,"(This review is for the 4 individual volumes as a whole)The selling point for these DVDs is having to pay only a fraction for the set (Volumes 1, 2, 3 & 4) than what the single package costs AND coming with awesome keepsakes (including CDs!). There is extra content but it's not that entertaining (behind the scenes live-action/American S.O.S. Brigade fan thing). There's about 3 episodes per disc, with the second disc containing the original broadcast order in Japanese with English subtitles.Also note - this is only season 1 - there is a season 2 that happens simultaneously among these episodes that you should also check out (just mind the infamous 'Endless Eight' section :P)"
1,Why accept the original statement when we can twist it ignorantly?,"Don't let the star rating fool you. I love Haruhi, I think it's one of the best series to grace a stale anime scene in quite a while. However, I don't like America's inability to keep this show in its original format.The DVDs play out this entire series in order, which was not really meant to happen, the original broadcast in Japan was played out of order to give the series a more broken but interesting feel. It's one of the things that made the show great, but America screwed it up by offering us the series in a linear fashion. Sad, considering the series climax is in friggin episode 7.If you buy these DVDs, buy them all at once, and research how the show was meant to be presented. It will make the series infinitely better.Screw corporate incompetence."
5,DYNAMITE! An indictment against organised religion at it's WORST!,"I've been studying this incident for meny years, and having just seen SEPTEMBER DAWN, it rekindled my dislike and mistrust for organized religion, especially these loonies! The LDS church has NEVER come close to admitting even knowledge of the incident, much less full-blown blame for it. Brigham Young not only knew about it; he ORDERED it, just as portrayed in the film. I'm sure the Mormons are telling their members to buy all the copies they can and burn them (it should really help sales figures), but it's a terrific film and hits the point head-on about Young's complicity in it. By the way, if you ever want to get rid of Mormons who come to your door in the middle of dinner, just ask the about the Mountain Meadows Massacre and watch them RUN!!!"
1,Mormon's Should Jihad,Hollywood has once again shown how much it dislikes organized religon.This movie is an anti Mormon movie. It depicts a time in history when something bad occurred and some Mormons in Utah during the 1850's made a horrible decision. But this movies purpose is not to tell that story it is to make the LDS church look bad to people that don't know much about it. If the LDS were Muslims they would declare a Fatwa against the producers. If they were Jews this movie could not have been shown the anti defamation league would have been all over it. Catholics and Mormons are always fair game by Hollywood because they don't fight back.
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I like movies based on actual historical events, so was looking forward to September Dawn. I was let down. Not sure exactly what, but something was missing from this movie. Maybe it's the fact too much time was spent on the fictional love story. This movie barely held my interest."
4,Good movie amazing closing song...,"If you're not a religious fanatic, you'll enjoy this movie. Its based upon some facts and intertwined with fiction (romance part) something similar to the Davinci Code movie. I enjoyed this movie and it was able to tug and evoke sadness and happiness during parts of the movie which is nicely done.The songs played in the movie is very good, and the closing song by Lee Ann Womack is one of the best songs I've heard this year. Its not played a lot but it seems to me that it should. This song is one of many songs that are up for the Oscars. If you can listen to this song, I can positively guarantee that you'll buy this song.In short, the movie is great, and the soundtrack is awesome."
5,Thank You for Exposing,"With so much garbage being put out in the movie industry, I'm glad there are still a few movie producers that put out quality subject matters worth watching and buying. This movie moved me to do more research on this story and Mormonism. What I found was very shocking. I hope people would really exercise their brain and actually find out whether something is true or not."
1,Insulting to my intellect,This movie cannot be called good on cinematic or historical grounds. If you watch this and take what they are portraying as true than do I have something to sell to you. Can't everyone see through this movie? While the atrocities are based on actual event the movie does not portray them in an accurate or fair manner. It is a diatribe and insulting to my intellect.
4,Mormonism,Excellent but disturbing docudrama of the darkest episode in Mormon history. Undoubtably very disturbing to many Mormons who have to a large extent been shielded from knowledge about this event.
4,Informative,This movie is an eye opener. I assume that not too many people know the story. I've been around for 66 years & didn't know this story.......and I have Mormon friends & acquaintances through the years. It was a good enough movie for me to watch a couple of times. Good acting & done in a quality way. It stays in my collection.
2,"Close, But No Cigar","I was slightly offended that the product discription said that it is uncertain whether or not Mormons participated in the massacre at Mountain Meadows. Modern historians do not have any doubt whether or not Mormons participated, there are documented confessions and witness accounts from some of the surviving children. The real standing question is just how aware and supporting was Brigham Young of the massacre. For more information, look up the work done on the subject by Will Bagley or Juanita BrooksI was really excited that someone was willing to address the massacre at mountain meadows in a movie, but unfortunately this one is not historically accurate. I mean, come on! You could at least have John D. Lee as one of the main characters! This movie fell short of my expectations, though I think the subject is powerful."
1,Disgusting spin on a dark day in history,"This movie gets a single star for being brave enough to approach the topic of the Mountain Meadows Massacre, but loses all integrity when put to the task of proving it's assertions.I'm really sorry that people are so quick to swallow bile like this as fact - worse yet that they think this is a portrayal of Mormons everywhere. The Mountain Meadows Massacre was a horrendous episode that deserves to be studied honestly and learned from, not used as a gimmick to whip people into a blood frenzy. It is that type of scenario that led to the massacre in the first place.Avoid this production like the plague."
4,September Dawn,"Great movie. A true story that needed to be told. Very eye opening for those who aren't familiar with the events that occurred at the ""Mountian Meadow Massacre""."
1,Didn't last,"I got about 3 uses out of my Bosu ball. I enjoyed using it but it developed a small hole near the base and despite trying a few different fixes, it won't remain inflated long enough for a workout."
5,Great Deal!,"I've been tracking the prices of the Bosu Balance Trainer for months, and this was the first time I had ever found it lower than $99. It is exactly what you see in stores - including the DVD and pump. Shipment was faster than expected."
4,Bosu balance trainer,I am very pleased with the quality of the Bosu balance trainer and have been using it on a regular basis.
4,Good for the Core,"Seems to be a top quality product. I first used a BOSU at the direction of my personal trainer and felt it gave an extremely beneficial workout for many muscle groups, particularly the mid-section, e.g. abs, obliques, and lower back. Do some sqauts on a BOSU holding a couple dumbells and you'll get a great 5 to 10 minute workout...."
5,I Love It!,"I first used the Bosu at a fitness center. I loved it so much I bought one for my ""home gym"". Assembly is easy. Just use the pump (included with purchase) to inflate. It comes with a DVD containing three short workouts. In the workouts, the Bosu is used much like a step in step areobics. The workouts are fun and challenging. I use my Bosu for doing squats and lunges. I also stand/balance on it while using hand weights to do bicep curls, shoulder presses, tricep kickbacks, etc. The added challenge of keeping your balance while strength training really works your core. I noticed a difference in my abs within weeks."
4,Great workout,Excellent for regaining balance.Can be used as a total gym to workout every part of the body.The pump needs to be rplaced.It stinks.
3,"Helpful, but.....","I bought one on the recommendation of a personal trainer I know. The BOSU is helpful for balance training in conjunction with strength and flexibility training. Unfortunately, my BOSU developed a leak at the site where the pump is attached to inflate the BOSU. This occured just after a year of careful use (no direct sunlight, no tossing or dropping the BOSU, etc). As it stands, I either must inflate the BOSU each time I wish to use it, or buy a new one.The pump is lightweight, flimsy, inexpensive plastic, and you may wish to find a better pump that is more efficient to use.I think that the BOSU is very useful in physical fitness but it really should last longer than its one-year warranty."
4,So Glad to Have It!,"I've wanted a Bosu for a very long time & was happy to finally get one. It was simple enough to inflate and I have been using it regularly. The Bosu came with an instructional DVD that has 4 different workouts. For the workout I was most interested in, Abs, the DVD is all scratched and skipping. Possibly it's my DVD player? I haven't investigated enough, but all 3 other workout sections on the disc, work. So I'm kinda disappointed in that regard. I keep picking up hints and tips from the fitness mags I read though, so I will get the hang of it eventually. It's harder than I thought! Which is a good thing. It amazes me that so many people don't even know what a Bosu is!"
2,Bosu Ball,"The pump that comes with the ball, is a piece of junk, as other reviewers have suggested. My pump came with a cracked plastic hose, I had to give it a number of wraps with teflon tape before I could get the ball blown up."
4,Hard to Inflate,"The instructions do not make clear just how hard it can be to put the cap in after you've inflated the ball. There is a tremendous amount of air pressure coming out, meaning you have resistance, and the hole it goes in is quite small. It took me over an hour to successfully inflate and seal the ball.Once it was inflated, it's exactly what I wanted. The included workout DVD is bland, but worth a watch through to learn a few exercises you might not have thought of on your own."
5,Same as gym quality,"The big thing with the BOSU balls is that the ""ball"" portion be made from a durable material. This BOSU is made of the same thick material that is found at a commercial gym. My wife and I have been using it for about 5 weeks now, 2x each per week with no issues. It has not needed to be re-filled with air in that time."
2,Doesn't hold air for very long,"This is a great exercise tool, unfortunately, it won't hold the air for more than one session. I have to re-inflate it every time I use it. And the cheap plastic pump falls apart. I'm using a electric pump now since I have to fill it up every time I use it. For the money it's not worth the effort. The quality of the product is very poor."
5,As a Professional Trainer this is the best product I've ever used,"As stated, this is by far the most versatile and effective tool I've ever used in my 12 years of fitness training. I bought the home version (which is exactly the same as the professional version BTW) and both of them have lasted over 2 years and countless sessions with dozens of different clients (including obese clients). I have had the issue of one Bosu coming ""unglued"" from the base, but luckily I bought it from Sports Chalet and was able to return it without issue.Highly recommended for all purposes...rehab, advanced sports training, general fitness, balance for seniors...This product is the BOMB"
5,Good item,Exactly what the description says it is. It inflated very easily and the special needs classroom just loves the way it works for the children.
3,NEXT GENERATION BOSU,"If you have purchased a SECOND GENERATION/lastest Generation or the latest model, I'd like to see your review. My husband and I have been investingating purchasing this item, but want the best model out there on the market. If you purchased OUTSIDE of Amazon, can you kindly indicate where you purchased it? Thank you!!BOSU Balance Trainer"

1,"I bought this, pure trash","Stay away, bought this a long long time ago, never reviewed it. I wish i could give it a -1. It will start falling apart, the unit including the remotes are not well maid. Save your money and buy a Viper or Python instead , or buy anything but this one. Trust me."
3,Bicycle,The bike would have been great but when it arrived the frame was scratched in several places. Since I needed the bike I was unable to send it back to have it replaced.
5,It's a Beach Crusier,"No problems, it's a great beach cruiser, it does exactly what you would expect and want a beach cruiser to be. Added a Bell Memory foam seat, the bike is extremely comfortable to ride."
3,takes a lot of work,"I got this bike and was shocked at how much work was needed after removing it from the box to get it operational. The rear wheel was bent right out of the box. A quick trip to the bike shop after removing the tire and tube to get the rim straightened and trued was needed. Then came the gear adjustment which took me about an hour to get it right and I'm not sure how long it will last. The brakes well....gotta say they are cheap. The paint was chipped in many places on the frame. Once I got all the kinks worked out it is quite nice, a bit heavy but I'm not looking for a racing bike."
2,Not that great!,I was disappointed in my bicycle. The back tire (wheel) is out of round and the brake drags all the time no matter what I do. So each time I ride I set it to a place where it won't drag and then never use that brake! It is pretty cheaply made and had to be completely assembled at home. I guess you get what you pay for!
1,"Completely untalented writing, awful book","This book was one of the worst books I've ever read, and I am a very avid reader. I am a fan of the Gossip Girl and A-List series, and this book is desperately trying to be like these series, but fails miserabley. The author displays little or no talent, the characters are shallow, hopelessly stupid, and annoying. There are also stereoptypes and racial comments that are offensive. Stay away from this book, it's awful and a complete waste of time!!!"
1,hopeless book and completely NOT TRUE,"As a student of Highland Park High School I found this book completely demeaning. Not only is it poorly written, the author obviously didn't take the time to visit HP and realize that the student body is made up genuinely nice and caring people. Everything about this book is fabricated. I also resent the reviews published by ""iloveteenbooks"" (or whatever) citing Highland Park as the most racist part of Dallas. I honestly think she is racist for considering Highland Park only a white, racist suberb of Dallas. Elena from CT also must be incredibly narrow minded to believe that Dallas is simply a honky tonk, cowboy hat, and cheerleader demography. All in all, dont buy this book...i feel so embarrassed for Francine Pascal"
1,sucks,"this book is horrible, i didn't finish reading it because it was so bad. not only was it boring but also horribly written and completely false. Don't waste your money on purchasing this book."
4,It's just fiction!!,"I grew up in Texas (Arlington) and am familiar with the setting of this book. I had to just laugh when I read it. Then I had to laugh harder when I read some of these reviews! Ladies...it's just fiction!! Relax, no one is judging you by this book. It's make-beleive.I thought it was fun read!"
4,The Ruling Class,"I think it is a really great book and I like how you switch the points of view. I like your book but, I can't relate to it because I'm really cute but, I'm not bratty about it. I am one of the popular girls in my school and I am like Gretchen from the movie Mean Girls cause I'm kind of always following the leader of the popular group around and I'm always easy to push around. In the movie Mean Girls the leader is Regina George, the second highest royalty of The Plastics ( the popular group) is Gretchen Wieners, and the third is Karen Smith. Brandi from my school is like Regina George, I'm like Gretchen Wieners, and my friend Jordan (Jo-Jo)is like Karen Smith. I'm not sure if you understand what I'm trying to say but, I hope you do understand that I give The Ruling Class a very good review and Francine Pascal you are a very good writer!!!!!!"
1,um wtf,"I just have to say that a Highland Park High School does in fact exist in Dallas, and I feel compelled to make clear that this book gives readers a deceptive, not to mention alarming, portrayal of the school's actual student body. I attended J.J. Pearce High School (after Jessica Simpson), but a considerable amount of my friends were/are Highland Park students; I can certify that the teens there definitely do not behave as those in the slanderous pages of ""The Ruling Class."" Highland Park does not have a problem with cliques or exclusiveness or bullying of any kind. If anyone is excluded it is because they choose to be. With that said, I strongly suggest that Miss Pascal use better judgment the next time she considers publishing a book that could defame an honorable high school and embarrassing its students."
1,don't waste your time,"I found this book to be very racist and offensive. there's everything from calling mexicans theifs and calling this girl a loser because she's black.I could hardly turn the page of this awfully bad book. the characters were unrealistic. No one could be as dumb as Myrna. As a high school student myself this book is unrealistic, and stupid. Don't waste your money on it, it's not worth it."
2,"Good Quality Item, But Not Flexible as it is Described to Be","I bought the Rubbermaid T410-Flexible OverHead Dusting tool with 60"" aluminum handle for the Rubbermaid quality you can expect it to be. That was achieved but the flexible dusting head is NOT flexible.I needed a wall and ceiling (90 degree) flexible dusting head, this allows only several degrees of flexiblity achieved only by adding extra pressure to the handle. Disappointed"
2,Rubber band!,"I bought that pair of shoes because they were ""big bargain"". But what I really doubt is how an expensive pair of shoes has its slingback made of...Rubber band! yes, Rubber band, not covered, not painted, a simple rubber band like the one you use at office and for packing purposes!"
1,Talk without a person,"The CDROM is simply a voice talking, no picture of Lee Milteer. Her advice is common sense. Not worth any money. Buy a five dollar book on changing yourself. After all she quotes a great deal from books."
2,No sands of Iwo Jima,The Flying Tigers portion was fine but The Sands of Iwo Jima was defective and does not play.
5,You will read it lifelong,"I discovered the book in my early 20s. 20 years later I am still reading it... In format, but not so much in content, it is similar to Adorno's ""Minima Moralia"".I cannot really describe what it is about and it is profoundly unsettling, but you cannot put it down. I recommend Saramago's ""The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis"" to be read with this..."
5,"Fernando Pessoa, literary masterpiece!","Fernando Pessoa should be mandatory reading for World Literature classes.Thru his writings he courageously, poetically and beautifully expresses what most of us feel uncomfortable with, let alone ponder or rip apart - the deep recesses of our minds and the not so pleasant frailties of the human soul. Carving from within and expressing his deepest feelings with outstanding poetic beauty, Pessoa loved life enough to leave us this (and other) outstanding literary legacies. Thru them, forever, he remains eternal, stunning us with the uniqueness of his soul.Fernando...thank you for your brilliant mind, heart and for passionately living, writing and loving the city you and I shared from birth, the ""muse"" that forever inspired us both = beautiful Lisbon!Fernando Pessoa was an exquisite hard to find gem, and totally Portuguese,to this day he still shyies away from the spotlight, yet deserving the notoriety of a MAJOR writer. This is mandatory reading for the masses...."
1,Not so hard to put down,"Okay, so I've read only 50 pages or so, and I'm finding the book very easy to put down, and I'm still waiting for him to turn a corner (as another reviewer puts it) and totally change his miserable attitude. As far as I can tell so far, this is just Pessoa scribbling all his depressing thoughts in a journal--no plot OR poetry so far that I can detect, and I'm a lover of modern poetry. I am going to finish it though, just to see if it will change my life, as so many claim it will, but why do I have a sneaking suspicion that it's going to be one big wallow through all 500 pages?"
2,"'absurdly' overrated --or, ""An existential masterpiece"" . . .","Sure to become a part of the ever growing existentialist canon, Pessoa's resurrected, unpublished manuscripts make their appearance here for the first time in English. The platitudes that constitute the majority of the text are banal in the main, comically Schopenhauerian the rest of the time. This reviewer would put zero stars if he could, but amazon does not allow it, and it happens to be slightly more competent than average, as far as these things go --nearly Dostoevsky-ish in bits and flashes.The Book of Disquiet -- now a penguin 'classic', peddled to devotees of ""the bourgeois philosophy"". An atavistic triumph for Stalinist literary criticism the world over."
1,The Book of Pretentiousness,Nothing can prepare you for this work. No one in the history of literature has written with more pretentiousness and self-indulgence. How Pessoa can present himself as both pathetic and heroic at the same time is a miracle of narcissism. In contemporary terms this is like an adolescent blog. He dismally attempts to disguise his platitudes as lyrical profundity.
5,its great,"when this first arrived i thought "" well thats not going to work"" but boy was i wrong. i used it in my underwear drawer amd one in my sock drawer. i went from rummaging through an over flowing drawer to being able to find what i want in an instant. it made more room not less as i originally feared. i am now getting another for my nylons drawer. would not recommend for underwire bras though."
3,OK product,"I bought this to store my bras and panties, but ended up using it for socks instead. The small compartments are TOO small for panties (unless you wear small g-strings) and the larger compartments are too small for bras. So, I use the small compartments for socks (perfect size), the medium compartment for a couple pairs of tights, and the large compartment for a few camisoles."
3,Large Drawer Organizer,"I bought this to use in my nursery so I had a way to organize baby socks, bibs, and pacifiers in the dresser. I measured the organizer and my drawer to ensure that this item would fit in my dresser - however, despite being the ""correct"" measurements we couldn't get this item to fit. My husband had to trim some plastic off of all 4 corners of the tray to get this to fit into my specific drawer. Now that it actually fits, I like the product, but I wouldn't go through the hassle to purchase again, if I had to."
3,Durable,"Durable plastic, which was not described when I purchased. I was looking for a soft orgazier as plastic isn't good to work with, so it didn't meet my expectations Other than that, good item if you don't mind trying to squeeze something into a hard box."
1,not what I expected,This product is poorly made. The holes in the bottom make it impossible to transport from one drawer to another without completely emptying first. I find it useless and the image preview deceiving.
1,"Do your money a favor, look elsewhere","There may well be a part of this book with redeeming value, but I still think you could make more efficient use of your time reading something without the philosophical conjecture and social science theory. This woman is, among other things, a phychiatrist, and this may well explain her comfort with all manner of things which may as well be anything but testable knowledge. While she goes at length about how we became a ""no-consequences"" culture, and why this must be remedied, she also, amazingly, seems to take the once a victim always a victim (so get over it and go on) mentality that is so popular with the crowd that believes in accountability and responsibility, just so long as it's never able to catch up with their money. There must be something better out there..."
3,AWESOME PHOTOS!!,"The B8350 does a great job of printing photos. To test the Vivera inks, I set a photo on the window sill, exposed to sunlight. After over a month, it's still sitting there with no perceivable fading! The photos I printed on my old 1315v would fade from a weekend in the sun.Also worth mentioning is that the B8350 has a very nice quality feel and appearance to it. This is the first ink jet I have owned that does not sound like it's going to jump off of the desk or fall apart when printing in ""Fast Draft.""I edited this review to remove my comments about poor text printing quality. I realized that the grayish text was a result of having a photo cartridge in, instead of black! If you purchase this printer, be sure to order some black ink as it only comes with the rgb and photo cartridge. You can imagine how foolish I felt when I realized my mistake. Anyhow, it's GREAT printer!"
4,HP B8350 Printer,"The HP B8350 does a beautiful job of printing on the paper that I use (Staples double sided matte) however I have a few hang ups.It can take up to five minutes just to send the print job to the printer which obviously adds undesired time to a print job and I had some issues with it not wanting to print on larger paper, which is, of course, the only reason I bought it. HP was absolutely no help on that problem and I resolved it myself, but I have no idea how I did that.I would also like to see more definative communication from the lights and buttons on the front.Given the price for the quality, I would buy it again."
4,Holy Cow! What a Printer!,"I would have given this printer 5 stars except for the fact that it does not print directly from a media card, but I can live with that. (I also wish it had included an owner's manual; I don't want to print out 154 pages from the hp website!)I was looking for a printer that would handle paper wider than 8 1/2 inches (I am a scrapbooker) and this model fills the bill for a reasonable price. But its most outstanding quality is its absolutely stunning photo prints! I found things in my photos that I did not know were there. Skin tones are absolutely accurate. And it is speedy. I love my new printer!"
5,Series in Good Hands,"This series has always been as much about political commentary as it has Remo and Chuin's extraordinary powers. I am glad this author has decided to bring back the satirical aspect of the series. After 115 books, it's difficult to image these stories remaining so entertaining just by sticking to the superhero storyline. This episode had a particularly funny encounter between Smith (the hero's boss) and the Womanizer In Chief. I recommend this book to anyone who has previously read this series, but has drifted away. It is also good for those of you who say the movie in the 80's and wondered who that guy was supposed to be."
5,The Masters of Sinanju still standing as the smoke clears!,"I've been reading the Destroyer from the beginning and it has become one of my favorite book series, like a lot of readers I was worried the series was history with some of the poor books that came out in the recent year or so. But after reading the fatherland series and this book I think the author has a good feel for the characters and will return the books to being fun and exciting again. This book was everything I've come to expect from the Destroyer, it was fun and easy reading. Keep up the good work!"
1,What can co wrong with a simple cocktail shaker?,"Well, a lot, surprisingly.I just made my first martini so take my review with a grain of Lemon Twist.First thing that went wrong: while shaking the ice and cocktail mix, the thing froze on the outside, bad enough that the ice stuck to my fingers. Why not make the exterior from some rubberized material?And way worse: the cap stuck. When I attempted to pull the cap off, only its metal shell came off, and the plastic cap remained stuck. No amount of manual twisting (bare-handed, or with a towel) was enough to remove the cap, until I donned a rubber glove for better grip. This is not exactly acceptable - why not make a screw-in cap, like most bottle caps?See customer images for what this affair looked like.I'll return this to BevMo (which BTW sells it for double the price on Amazon)."
3,Copper River Smoked Salmon,"SeaBear has always met my expectations, however this year seems to be the exception. It is not only this brand, but another as well that seem to be below par from previous years. Because this has happened twice in a row by two different companies, it makes me wonder if the salmon season this year overall was disappointing."
2,good and bad,"once it gets here, very good taste and condition, except now i check the web and find northeast and a few others considerably less expensive same amount; i also had a problem with the shipping- from them cross country to upstate ny; they send an email saying 4-8 days, but elapsed from when ordered to delivery (tracking said ""on time"") was 11 days- to get a small package to the east coast? not what they said; surf for a better deal"
1,Salmon,I did not like the product at all. I expected smoked salmon but when I opened the product it did not look like smoked salmon. It looked all mushy and fell apart.
4,Not angry,"Good book. It included a quiz at the beginning to determine if I would benefit by the book, which had been recommended to me by a Cardiac Rehab program. My anger levels are actually low, in all three measured ways, so I was able to avoid reading most of the book. What I did read seemed to me that it may need some updating, though newer versions may have done so. I had an older copy. The quiz did save me time."
3,"Good for a bedroom, but not a main entertainment system.","This system has solid sound at lower levels and can easily accomodate less demanding audio needs. If you're looking for a small but complete package, this will serve nicely. Don't expect this to handle higher volumes levels without distortion, though."
5,Great System!,This system handles sound wonderfully. I really dont use it for home theater use but for music. It handles loud sound surprisingly well too. Great wattage and wonderful bass. It has equalizer settings that make it sound great. It just has such a high-quality sounbd for such a low-priced system. I have seen this at other stores for like $! I really love it and it fits so well in places.
3,A Good Mystery At Last!,The mystery aspect of the movie is brilliant! Its one of the few good moviews made in the last few years! a Definite must watch
4,In the middle of a change...,"Part way thru the story and things are changing. This here is a fine show and I've already bought it all instead of waiting for the inevitable box set because of it. Some of the female voice actors where lacking, but I'm guessing the American producers have a way too small bunch of women to fill in most of the roles. So some of the dub is awful, but it's in small batches."
2,Terrible remastering of a wonderful gem,"When I first saw this item I was thoroughly excited because the original CD release is flat in sound. But when I started listening to this UK remaster I thought to myself 'where is the warm, rich, full-bodied sound the this album was famous for'. Here you get a glaring tinny sound. I find it so distracting - and physically uncomfortable on the ears that after 3 or 4 tracks I have to take it off. I decided to listen to my vinyl copy and yes, I wasn't imagining things. On the vinyl the sound is beautiful, lush and dynamic.Someone really messed up on this CD. Even the original CD is more listenable."
5,Highly Recommend,"Whether or not you choose to follow the author with 'No Entry Accounting' is really not relevant to the importance of this book. Cash Flow Management as the key underpinning of success of a business is a critical concept that makes this book one of the first ones I recommend to aspiring business owners, in-house entrepreneurs, and people in general trying to grab their financial health by the short hairs. Businesses do not just fail because they are unprofitable. Many profitable businesses fail because they trigger the 'cycle of demise' and don't realize it until they are too far down the rabbit hole to save themselves.Is this book all things to everyone? No, it is not a silver bullet that owning or reading will insure your success. What will however, is the central message of perpetual financial vigilance and methodical record handling.-john"
3,I Would Have Faired Better Using the Knowledge I Already Had,"This book has not given me any new information, everything I read was something I already knew.It may be helpful to someone who doesn't have the time to go on the internet and gather free information."
5,Perfect for the Sony RX100,Great quality and a perfect fit for the Sony RX100. The two zippered pockets on the front offer fairly limited storage but are big enough to easily accommodate an additional memory card and a battery.
2,Dimensions were smaller than posted,"The product is well made and perfect for a smaller and slimmer camera. My camera is a Canon Power Shot SX130 IS and squeezes into the case. The dimensions were listed inaccurately, and they have since changed them since I reported it. I will have to use it for my small Fuji WP camera."
2,Camera pocket in the back,"This bag is well made and is a good size for my Sony camera. The down side is the main compartment for the camera is in the back of the bag. It is a little awkward to open and grab and replace the camera. The padding is decent and I want to love this bag, but I don't like it very much. I'm keeping it because I am too lazy to return it and order different one"
3,This is not for Sony T and N Series,"You can always put a digital camera in a Handy Cam Bag, that does not mean that Handy Cam Bag is a digital camera bag right? This is what the situation is with this bag. It almost has a capacity to keep two Sony T or N series cameras.This Camera bag is good for any midsize digital camera with two extra pockets to keep extra battery, memory stick etc. Cameras like DSC W1, W5, W7, W55, W30, S85, S650, S90, S60 etc. will go fine with this bag.The quality of Bag is very good but this is not meant for Sony T or N series cameras."
4,Sony Carrying case,"It's an excelent case, it provides space for my camera, extra battery, memory card, and some other things. It was sent on time."
4,carrying case,"Fine product but I would like a better clip for when I don't have a belt. Plenty big for my camera, jpocket with room for spare memory card and battery, nice case."
1,Scattered,"This book glorifies former MDC police detective Joe McCain. It switches chapters detailing McCains exploits (glorifying them really) and his son's current police career, which is uneventful at best. The chapters regarding the son are best skipped. Atkinson does not paint him in a likable format. That said, half the book is not even worth reading, and the other half is not worth buying."
2,"Was there, knew that.","The book was well written, but having ""been there, knew/know them"", for 97% of the people mentioned in this book.....a lot of it is just plain NOT TRUE. Good stories, but, fiction nonetheless."
2,Irish crime,This book is a waste of time. The Winter Hill Mob is an intersesting reality but this seems to about some cop and his peculiar involvement.
2,Fabricated Cop Story,Naive author plays ivestigator while trying to tell the story of a larger than life hero cop. Not worth the time. Boring and dry. Did not like listening to the author recount stories of how he and other investigators chased people around Massachusetts for insurance fraud. Then in the next chapter how a Met cop single handedly took down organized crime. Author tries his hardest to recount stories and blow them out of proportion to entice the reader.
1,make our daugther CRY,"That thing wont stay up. it kept falling apart. Everytime, it fell apart, my daugther cried. She tried to put back together and was so frustarding. She, I mean herself is only 3 years old and she put the swing in the trash. Poor my little girl. We're getting another one this week for her birthday even tho the one in the trash was received last Christmas."
1,Junk,I had the same problem as everyone else. It just falls apart every time you touch it. A useless waste of money. My daughter was very dissapointed.
2,Baby swing is not durable for toddlers,My children owned this swing one day and my toddlers can disassemble it in a minute. It is not sturdy and falls apart easily.
2,Little mommy swing NOT made well at all,My daughter was thrilled to get this for christmas with the rest of the set for the Little mommy doll.It came out of the box with easy basic instructions to put it together.BUT once it was put together my daughter went to put her doll in and it fell apart.Not the whole thing but the arm that holds the swing onto the base keeps falling off.My friends does the same nthing. Very cheaply made.Was not impressed at all.
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!,"I am so horrified at how poorly made this swing is. It is way too small, for even my 2-year old to play with. She loves her Little Mommy doll, but the furniture that goes with it has not been very impressive at all.It barely swings, and if it does... it falls apart!!I wish I had read the reviews before buying it. It's adorable to look at, but that's the only thing that you can do with it... LOOK AT IT!I DO NOT recommend at all!"
2,flimsy,"Swing comes out of base every time you try to put the baby doll in it and I bought the exact baby for it. The educational value of 3 stars is for me, you get what you pay for most of the time."
1,do not buy this,"This thing is a waste of time effort and money. It falls apart the minute the child tries to swing the baby, not to mention it is too small for a two tear old to play with."
4,nice toy,"Just got this swing for my 2 and 3 years old daughters 3 days ago. Both love it very much, they've been putting their baby doll in it. The day and night lots to love baby doll with soft body fit in it quite well. So far so good, nothing is broken yet."
3,just okay- not great,I was a bit disappointed in this toy. It certainly looks great. It comes apart very easily and is just not terribly well made.
2,Wobbly Swing,"I got this for my 2 and 4yo daughters. They really wanted to play with it because they love their baby dolls so much, but it kept falling apart. The connections at the back legs would come apart as soon as the doll would start to swing. The little items hanging from the mobile are very small and I took them away right away. This toy is a good idea, it just needs to be made a little more durable for the little people who will be using it."
2,Cute Swing but looks can be deceiving.,"We bought this swing for our 2 year old...She was so excited to get a swing for her baby. Too bad she doesn't care about it now. We love the Little Mommy things but they were off when they made this one. This toy constantly falls apart...the legs come unattached as does the actual baby seat from the holder. If u move it it falls apart, if u use it it also falls apart. The tray doesn't slide out very far so it is almost impossible to get the baby in and out and we only use the actual Little mommy doll that they claim fits easily. My now 3 year old still doesn't play with this or even ask for it. Half of it is under our bed and she is just fine with that. It looks very cute but that is about it. Save your money on this one."
1,no fun to play with,"This is a very aggravating toy for a small child to play with. Every time my two year old trys to put a doll in the swing, the whole thing collapses. It is very hard to get a doll into the swing and forget trying to get it back out. I do not recommend this toy at all. Not durable and no fun to play with."
2,a little dissapointing..,"first of all, i LOVE all the little mommy toys.. we have most of everything they put out however this swing is so dissapointing... it comes apart when the children try to move it (VERY frustrating) and it is so hard to put the baby in and take out.. the girls won't play with it anymore... it just sits there and looks cute with the rest of the stuff.."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! Piece of junk! WASTE OF MONEY!,"I bought this for my daughter along with the other Little Mommy furniture accessories last Christmas (Doll Carrier, Care Center, Shopping Cart, and Swing) and it was a piece of junk. It constantly fell apart that my kids (ages 4 and 2 at the time) lost interest and didnt even want to play with it anymore. Too hard to take dolls in and out of (even the Little Mommy dolls made to go with it) and its not made very well either, the plastic is flimsy, the top of the swing kept popping off the legs and it would collapse, we just ended up trashing it. It was a COMPLETE waste of money. The Little Mommy dolls and outfits are great but the furniture is worthless, you'll literally be throwing your money away in a matter of weeks."
1,Very very mediocre,"Wow. I ordered this item for a friend who has a chocolate lab that she is obsessed about. In the picture it looks like a very nice, cute glass ornament, but actually it is a 1 inch tall figurine that is made out of some weird glass that feels like plastic, comes in a cheap-looking plastic bag, and looks like I literally got it out of a 25 cent machine. After shipping, it is in excess of $9, and my friend will probably cherish it while it is sitting in her attic for the next ten years. I advise you not to buy this, or any of the similar items from this seller."
4,Great ethnographic content,"This book contains several short stories that represent an entirely unique persepective on Indian life. Jhabvala successfully removes her writing from the idealist realm, and shatters the popular ""everything East is magical and wonderful"" misconception. The stories are very realistic, and are rich with cultural content."
2,Read it with a pinch of salt,"Ok read in my opinion. Some stories in this book don't seem to have a plan for characters and plot. Although the characters do seem real and at time complicated, with out a strong personality and life.Most stories seems to be written as a 3rd person even though they are narrated as 1st person..."
5,great songs!,"misia is one of the most well-known signers in japan. her voice is powerful and her songs make me... sometimes encouraged, sometimes happy."
2,"great idea, poor performance",keeps coming off as I walk. I have tried on both feet and no difference. I would love to hear how others make it work
3,It is not made for the great toe,"My sore toe cleared up in a week by using this product; however, the cap was not made for the average male big toe. It was necessary to force it on and it tore out on the end, but luckily, my problem was resolved by then."
1,the footsmart gel toe cap large toe,the product you sent me was not for a big toe not even close they need to research it more
2,Unsure,"I am unsure about this product. I run about 18 miles per week. I wanted to try this as a preventative measure. My second toe gets a blister on the tip. I wanted to prevent it from getting a blister under my nail. Well I haven't gotten a blister under my nail, but my toe is still sore under the nail after my runs. I am not sure why, but it is also sore if I do not wear this. So, I do not see a difference."
4,FootSmart Gel Toe Cap,"Hey, this product actually works. If you have a weird second toe that sticks out beyond the big toe, then this Toe Cap is for you. Does make the shoe fit a little tighter, but it protect my poor beat up second toe from the slings and arrows of fast walking."
2,very big!,"If the purpose of this toe cap is to protect the nail maybe it's worthy. My purpose was to protect my socks and shoes, that always became with a hole once my toe has a protuberant nail. The toe cap is to spaceous to wear inside socks. It is confortable, but even without socks it takes some room inside the shoes."
1,Overpriced and not recommended,"Bought fonecam for off-site warehouse monitoring. The image isnot good, after 1 week the product stopped working. After exchange,the second copy stopped working as well. Overpriced and not recommended."
1,Not very good,"We got one copy of the FoneCam to watch the backyard of the summer house. It is extremely slow. When we dial in to get the picture, it appears to transmit the image forever. The quality of the picture is not very good either. For the price that it cost, we could have bought a small PC and couple of cameras."
2,OverRated Gadget,"We own a FoneCam. We were very enthustiastic when we got it, we were going to use to watch our house when we were gone. -- the Camera doesnt give you a clear picture and the built in modem is not realiable at all....It's an over rated gadget"
5,a nice pony book,"This is a good story of a girl who's family rents a small house and barn for the summer. Although the girl does not have her own horse, she leases one from her riding school to have there with her. This is the story of how she finds a hidden valley where her neighbor keeps a herd of beautiful show ponies. Full of colorful description and adventure, this story is a perfect getaway- and has a happy ending."
5,Very Comfortable,This was the greatest mouse pad I have ever had! It has a very coushy feeling to it and it great if you work at your computer for a long time in a day. It also comes in a lot of different colors which is great becuase it can match you desk or computer. I would suggest this to any body!
3,Kyoto Jazz Massive - Spirit Of The Sun,"It's almost impossible not to admire an album as well-produced as Kyoto Jazz Massive's SPIRIT OF THE SUN. It encapsulates perfect the whole ""future jazz"" ethos: just jazzy enough to work a cocktail party, just rhythmic enough to make itself a presence on the dancefloor. But it's universality is also a drawback--it seems a bit too typical. You've got powerful divas singing uplifting vocals (and Victor Davies on ""Deep in Your Mind""; you've got funky breaks to keep your feet tapping. The instrumental ""Stargazer"" has an appropriate dreaminess, while ""Behind the Shadow"" is as light as a soufflé. But I want something that really demands my attention, rather than well-done tracks that slide off the consciousness. ""Eclipse"" starts to fit the bill, with its more aggressive drum sequence, and ""Substream"" kicks in with a 4/4 house beat, but it's not quite enough."
5,Fun & upbeat!,"My children had so much fun exercising with Kristi and JoJo the bear.We all loved the cute songs and caught ourself singing them the rest of the day. This video is fun, upbeat, and really encouraged my children to get up and exercise. It is one of the best kids video's out there!"
2,Surely this can't be the best one out there?,"I bought this for my 2yr old and 4 yr old to get them moving more. They follow along with some of the excercises and always enjoy the section on snacks, but that's about it. The exercises are difficult to follow, with no warning from the instructor about what is coming next, or you have to follow a group of confused children or a very poorly animated bear! The cardio section is particularly badly done. I can't believe this is supposed to be the best DVD out there! Keep looking!"
2,Not recommended by us,Our daughter has weak muscles and I wanted some workout videos we could do as a family to supplement her physical therapy. I saw all the good reviews and thought this would work for us especially since our girls love bears. NOT! It did not keep their attention and as adults the movie was a tad annoying to us.
3,Great for Preschoolers,"I was looking for a tape for older children and this tape was not it. This tape is definitely geared for the preschool crowd. For that age group, I imagine it is great. I was pretty disappointed."
2,Not enough exercise,I don't recommend this for children over 4. The exercise portion is so limited and too much time is spent talking rather than working out.
2,So So,"Good concept, but the production quality wasn't great, and the kids didn't seem to be motivated. I've seen better videos without the attempts at animation."
3,Informative,"This DVD comes packed with information about muscles and nutrition. My oldest daycare pals will do the exercises, but it hasn't captured the attention of the 2s and 3s. My 4s, however, are learning from it."
3,Not as engaging as I hoped it would be,"I was really looking forward to this DVD, but when I played it for my 2 1/2 year old son, he quickly lost interest. Like other reviewers have said, there is too much talking, not enough doing and when they finally do get into the exercises, they are pretty lame. I will be looking for a different DVD. Or I will just keep making up my own exercises, which my son has enjoyed. To bad I can't return this DVD, otherwise I would!"
3,Gets my girls going...a little,"My girls ages 3 1/2 & 1 1/2 like to watch this video for a little bit. My oldest ""works out"" to the video for about 5-10 minutes & then is done. I don't like the snack part in the video; I think it's poorly placed in the middle of the video. I think the instructor could be a bit more hyper & silly in order to relate more to kids."
5,you should be ashamed,"To imply that Jon Foster is merely a 'Phil Hale' clone is incredulous. Quite frankly i'm offended for him, if he isn't already. While there may be some similarities between his and Phil's work, it is only natural seeing as though they were both under the instruction of the same teacher and worked in the same studio space for quite some time. Style aside, they both have substancially different handling of subject and composition, and Foster's personality undoubtably shows through in his paintings (which is quite differen't from Phil Hale's). He is also one of the few artists who can paint digitally while still maintaining the same quality and feel as solid paint. His work is an inspiration to all artists who have doubts that with enough hard work, perseverance, and (of course) talent that anything is possible."
5,"A ""must-have"" for artists and art enthusiasts!","I've been waiting for this book for quite some time now and was finally able to get my copy! I've been a fan of Jon Foster's work after seeing it in the Spectrum illustration annuals and Progressions does not disappoint. Not only is the content of the book exciting and thought provoking, the actual layout lends itself perfectly to his work. Progressions is an interesting combination of sketches, paintings, and reflection which I highly recommend!"
2,Phil Hale Copycat,"I give this book two stars just to acknowledge the technical skill, but Foster's work disturbs me every time I see it, as a painter myself, nothing irks me more than a fawning painter who admires and copies another artist's style to the point of not really having a unique style of his own. Phil Hale is a better person than me beacuse I would have sued this guy by now. As an alternative I recommend ANYTHING with Phil Hale's work in it...a true master."
3,NO! Do listen to the Nay-sayer.,"Jon's skills as a painter are good, but having asked him myself why he imitates Phil Hale, he just looked at me and said, well I don't, I used to paint in the same studio as his but I don't understand what you mean. The book is fun to look at, but why not just go to the source? The laman may not understand but Hales work is as far above Fosters as Frazetta's is Ken Kelly's. The thing that bothered me most about the book is that Fosters seems to have gotten lazy and is finishing decent traditional paintings off by going in and doing digitally what it seems it to difficult(i know, its just time consuming)with the paint."
5,Amazingly comprehensive,This book will occupy a prime spot on my bookshelf. I've had to use a bunch of different books to find this kind of information before. It's nice to see such a wide range of topics from discrete math covered so thoroughly.
4,a masterpiece of understated fear and suspense,"Proof that the best of what movies can do to an audience depends not on beautiful faces in closeup, or lavish production, or even bright dialogue. You could watch ""Knife in the Water"" in Polish without any subtitles and still get chills. A young, privileged couple pick up a hitchhiker and take him out on their boat for the day. That's it. The rest is the suspense that builds between the three, especially between the two men, almost destined by biology and the nature of confined spaces to fight it out over the girl, at least symbolically, if not literally, to the death. Certainly the best Polanski film I've ever seen, one of my ten favorite movies of all time."
4,Great visual story telling,"This film should be considered a textbook on how to tell a story through visuals. Though little dialouge in the film, one can understand the characters perfectly and the whole atmosphere of tension is beautifully captured by Polanski. The abscence of a fifth star is because modern audiences might find the film slow for current tastes."
4,Terrific Looking Transfer to DVD,"A remarkably satisfying disc that gives viewers a crisp, virtually flawless transfer as well as lots of extras. Criterion should not, however, have agreed to Polanski's request disabling the search/forward and reverse functions. A truly dumb move that Criterion had best not repeat in future. Polanski gets to control his set, not my remote."
3,Knife in the Water (1962) - Roman Polanski,"Knife in the Water really shows a talented director in the making. Roman Polanski takes a simple story and through inventive camerawork and subtle actions he creates a thoroughly original thriller. However, the film is bogged down by subpar performances and a rather jerky pace. Polanski did well with what was available and his creativity would eventually shine through on films like Repulsion (1965) and Rosemary's Baby (1968). If your interested to see where this great director first started, Knife in the Water is a good choice."
3,"Good movie, terrible subtitles","Let me say right off: this was a pretty good movie. The direction was very good, the cinematography was beautiful (especially when they're on open water much of the time), it was a bit slow, but that speed felt right for what was going on.But at least 30% of the movie didn't have subtitles and, since I don't speak Polish, that's a lot of the movie that I missed. Granted, I could pick some of it up from context, but in a movie with so little dialogue, every bit matters. I don't understand how the vaunted Criterion can translate Japanese and Korean with ease, but not be able to get a good Polish translation.There wasn't much of a story and sometimes it felt more like a sailing movie than a thriller, but this is a movie one should watch just to see how good direction can elevate a story."
3,POLANSKI'S SPOOKY FIRST FEATURE,"Roman Polanski's first feature, KNIFE IN THE WATER (Criterion) is an idiosyncratic psychological thriller about a married couple who pick up a hitchhiker and take him sailing. The husband's an ass, the wife's frigid and the hitchhiker's a psycho. Naturally, they toy and taunt each other. Oh, and there's a large knife on board. And what's with Polanski's requestthat no scan forward or freeze frame function on the disc?"
4,A subtle study on vanity,"Roman Polanski directed his first feature film in a hale mood: we are sure of what's going on but the characters seem to be too anxious to reflect on their own behavior. The competition is based on a woman (Christine) and she lets the two men become more and more dangerous to each other. It's a subtle study on vanity. As we become more and more involved, the characters seem to become more vulnerable: they gain their own complexity never losing a truly human resemblance with each other. In Polish."
3,I give this movie 3 1/2 stars...it's pretty good,"I watched this movie last night, with subtitles which made it harder to watch the facial expressions etc. I liked it, didn't love it. Not nearly as captivating as Rosemary's baby, which I give 5 stars. A married couple pick up a young hitch hiker and then take him sailing on their boat, all the while seeming not to like him. The husband belittles him, the hitch hiker seems a little mentally ""off"" and the tension builds as these people keep toying with each other, esp. after the appearance of a very large knife. It is interesting...there just seems to be something missing...I guess that I really never cared about any of the characters much. The husband seems like a jerk, the wife seems cold and the hitch hiker is a bit psycho. I would have been disappointed had I paid for it, one viewing was enough."
1,COSTLY ADVERTISEMENT,"IF FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE NOTHING MORE THEN A ADVERTISMENT FOR A $2,000+ MEDITATION CLASS. I REGRET BUYING THS BOOK."
2,Does not teach the TM Technique!!!,"For the past few months i have been doing meditation daily. Since then i have been reading up on different forms of it. I ordered this book in order to learn about the TM technique, but it fails to teach it. In the chapter about the technique all it said was what the technique does, then at the end of the chapter, it says, the tm technique can only be tought by a practitioner and cannot be written down, therefore enroll in a tm program asap and buy a mantra, whoopie! THIS WHOLE TM ORGANIZATION IS A SCAM! if it were truly what Maharishi wanted, it probably would not be so, but all this book really is just an advertisement, a long brochure on why one should study tm. I would not recommend reading it."
1,Sales pitch for overpriced TM sessions,"This book is a complete SCAM,SCAM,SCAM !!Don't waste your time buying this book if you want to learn any TM techniques. This book rambles on the power of the universe, the mind, and how Maharishi Yogi was a poor spiritual man that left India to save the word through meditation techniques. There is more Blah Blah Blah and in every chapter they explain how Transcendental Meditation -- notice that is trade mark-- can save all the problems of the world and yours, BUT only if you pay a modest fee of 2,500 per session.The truth is he established a for-profit business called The Maharishi Group that invests from real estate to supper markets and they only care about money, not spirituality like the whole book preached."
1,There is no price low enough for this computer desk.,This computer desk requires full assembly. This isn't the problem. The problem is that the holes where the screws are supposed to go are not properly cut by the manufacturer. Unless you have a power drill it is impossible to assemble this desk with a conventional screw driver. The directions are awful as well. They are very difficult to understand and the drawings do not even correctly match the pieces they are depicting. This causes a lot of confusion as the instructions are not accompanied by written steps. The table scratches EXTREMELY easily and is made very cheaply. Spend a few extra dollars and get a desk worth having.
2,Disappointing Kindle Version,"I needed this book for a class, and I was ecstatic to see a rental option for the Kindle book. It was so much cheaper than my bookstore's price that renting it was a no-brainer. I'm not sure on the quality of the actual book, but the Kindle version has one huge problem: it doesn't have page numbers. There's absolutely no way to go to a specific page assigned for homework. Instead, you must magically know the location of the assigned page or spend an hour thumbing through the pages. To make matters worse, I attempted to return this book only to find out that you cannot return rental books. Now I'm out $43 for an unusable book. Hopefully this will keep anyone else from making the mistake that I did."
2,Too expensive.,"I read this book almost form back to back, nice reading material, simple and accessible, plus a little knowledge of modern french society. That said, I have to mention its price, it's a thin book that doesn't require a lot of energy to write, and nothing irreplaceable, same kind of thing you can read as much as you want in internet. And if you don't like look at the screen, there's plenty of books at less than one-fifth of the price, like Dover's parallel text, or Penguin's, or Mcgraw-hill's 'Easy french reading' and 'Better french reading', non of these is in any way inferior for reading. As for learning, 'French in action' is for superior for pedagogical purpose. I can only think that too many lazy french instructors use this as textbook, so as to give the publisher and authors a chance to rob our students. I am disgusted, even though it's a helpful book, it can be written by anyone. Nothing special about it."
2,Same old information,"This book is not for beginners or for the experience sound professional.If you have gone through the books by Yamaha or the Davis's you have hit most of the info given out in this book.If you begin with the first chapter on decibels your head will be spining.The decibel and its usage is a complicated matter which needs a good laymans explanation for a novice is poorly presented. Example a newcomer to sound may ask if I double my distance from 10 feet to twenty feet from a free field source will I percieve half the level or a quarter of the level at twenty feet?I purchase the book hoping to find more info on improving mixing techniques with more versitle boards such as effects usage with left center and right mixes. Pros and cons of pre eq when using a board forboth house and monitor. Best practices for in ear monitoring. And much more info on computerized testing.The book also needs to be organized better, diagrams should be on the same page as the text associated with them."
5,For the people,"this cd is truely one of the best. The first song i heard was ""check ya"" and i just love that song. The one things is that they have good vocal, lyrics, and they have good beats. you might think that their weird or whatever but just hear some of their songs and tell me if you don't like just at least a tiny bit of it of their music."
5,A band that truly deserves to be #1,From Zero is an absolutely amazing band. With their menencing blend of melodic singing and heavy guitars. You will defently want to buy their CD.
4,For those conflicted,"I bought this at Target, I won't lie. I was thinking about buying it on Amazon, but then I spotted it at Target for $8 and figured what the hell. And for $8 it's a really good deal. From Zero seems like a musical combination of Sevendust and Likin Park. This isn't a good way to find that grail that most nu-metal fans are seeking (perfect originality, something new), but as far as good goes, if bands like Disturbed and System of a Down are your zennith, then for for you From Zero will be just a step up from average. If you prefer the stylings of Sevendust or bands like them, you should seriously consider picking this one up."
4,From 0 to 4,"Not bad. Especially if a softer side of nu-metal is for some reason closer to you.A lot of melody shining through the usual heaviness, highly professionally played instruments, and impressing vocals are what offered to enjoy on the cd. Not that heavy, not too poppy, aimed to the masses that appreciate a mainstream melodic heavy rock.The real stand-outs are Smack, Erase, Other Side, Jeer, Tomorrow's Light, Suffering, and Gone.After this one you may easily switch to their recent album."
4,I Like!,"From Zero has a good, new, and original sound with heavy chorus's with good vocal's. I recommend this album."
3,Decent Debut,"I was bored as hell one day and turned on ""The Real World, New Orleans"" ( like I said, I was bored)and heard From Zero being played for the cast, I thought it was cool and bought the record. It is a good record, not much here though. It is just a normal nu-metal album from a band that probably won't make it far in this pop soaked world. Oh well, yet another talent gone to wsate.-FM"
2,nu metal sucks,"I really wish everyone would just stop liking these unoriginal nu metal bands, I mean From Zero isnt a bad band, and i think the average metal head will enjoy them, but it gets old real fast. If your looking for another stereomud/systematic/drowning pool ect. I suggest buying this, but if your looking for something new and original I would stay away."
2,"Same Old, Same Old","To make this short. It's the same repetative crap rock that's being put out today. The only good song on the album is ""the Other Side"". The melodies are tight and the music is awesome. i bought this album to get that song and hoped there would be other ""slower"" stuff on it. There's nothing wrong with slower. There's so many crappy bands out there that think the more aggressive you are the better the music is (i.e. Slipknot). My favorite band is Tool and they have some heavy stuff but some of their slower more intricate songs are some of the best. To sum this all up if you like real rock/music don't buy this! Download ""the other side""."
3,"Not a trendsetter, but definitely better than most.","(Man, why am I on a nu-metal kick for?)From Zero wasn't the greatest or baddest nu-metal band out there, but they were pretty good. Behind the singer's goofy antics was some half-way decent songs with some memorable hooks in them. I'll still attest that the song ""Check Ya"" was probably their brightest and maybe best, but if you're a fan of early-2000's nu-metal, this is worth at least a few listens."
2,Life lessons.,"FREE AND OTHER STORIES is a compilation of 15 short stories, each with unique characters who are reflecting on the past, learning valuable life lessons, or just coping with everyday life.Several of the stories had a good premise, but the others seemed to have no rhyme or reason to them whatsoever. Those stories seemed to pick up in the middle of the character's lives, with no insight into what brought them to the point in their lives where their story starts, or they end so abruptly, you're left wondering what happened. While I had no favorite story, the one that stands out the most in my mind is ""All These Years"", which is the story of an elderly couple reminiscing about when they first met and fell in love.Ms. Nailah has the capability to be a great storyteller, and I look forward to a full-length novel where her talents will be better recognized and appreciated.Reviewed by Renee Williamsof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
3,Way Too Expensive!!!!,I love this product! It is exactly what I was looking for to organize my baby's grooming items. It fits very well in my smaller dresser drawer. The price is almost $30 for one item! Definitely not worth that much for a piece of plastic!
2,This book was a very sugar coated view on dancing,"I am an exotic dancer and have been for 4 years. I thought that this book was a very good documentary on heidi's life, but the overall content on dancing is very sugar coated. I have worked in very classy upscale strip bars and hole in the wall bars also. Every bar that i have worked in dancers have issues w/ prostution, drugs, gambling and much more and none of this was included in her book. She made dancing out to be a very ligit job w/ no problems. That is just not true i have not met many dancers like heidi they are like 1 in a millon. Im not saying this wasnt a good book im just saying that i think she left a lot facts on dancing out.In fact i am writing a book now about the hard core reality of an exotic dancer. Look for it in the spring of 2000."
3,A good story...but far from reality,"I read this book when I was 23 and thought, ""Wow! Even I could be a stripper!"" Heidi makes this profession seem easy, fun and extremely profitable. I worked part-time as a stripper for three years after that and it was nothing like her book. She shows the fantasy side of stripping but doesn't touch on the realistic side. Now that I have survived through that experience, I realize how misleading the book was. If you want a true-to-life account of stripping, read STRIP CITY. I would, however, enjoy reading about how Heidi's life turned out after college."
4,One woman's experience in college & stripping,"An interesting book that tells of the author's experiances working as a stripper during her college years.Some of the negative reviews here seem to bash the author for not portraying a more of the seedier side of stripping, with tales of drug use, prostitution and the like. Well, tough. This was not an investigative expose of the business, but an autobiography. As such it should be about what she experienced. Not all people who take part in stripping have lurid tales to tell."
1,"Poorly Written, Boring, Don't Waste Your Time","This may be the first time I've ever - and I honestly mean EVER - given up in the middle of a book.The title, of course, drew most of us to this sad excuse for a memoir. Don't let it fool you, however. If you're searching for an introspective, insightful, possibly exciting peek into the hidden life of an adult venue, turn elsewhere. This is nothing more than the self-centered, self-aggrandizing, non-self-aware story of a girl who stripped to help pay for college in the 90's. Worse, it's poorly written and unbelievably boring. So boring that I actually stopped halfway through, chastised myself for wasting so much of my own time, and deleted it from my Kindle without a second thought."
3,"good book, but not the norm","i read this book in one night. her personality and tenacious will kept the book alive and moving forward. i'm a dancer in dallas, and things are very different. dancing is a full contact sport. guys expect quite a lot for their twenty bucks and four minutes. her strong sense of identity, loving family and the oodles of self-esteem are highly unusual among myself and the girls i know. this was a nice look at the industry, told by a nice girl. in reality, few of us can withstand night after night of honest contact with lots of men and still be chipper and happy with the world at large the next morning. still, her book was groundbreaking, told truthfully and gave a great role model in terms of self-respect. she acheived a personal triumph, no matter what the arena."
1,JUST ANOTHER STRIPPER STORY.,"This stupid and simple book is just another story os a stripper trying to justify herself. Heidi takes her clothes off to pay for her medical expenses and her high tuition at an expensive university-Who cares!...This story is dull, far too common and just another stripper trying to inspire other strippers."
1,ALL WRONG.,"Although, I respect Heidi Mattson's tenacity...she wrote a book and got it published -- that is about it. As a woman who has been in and around this business for many years -- I can honestly say that Mattson is still hiding the truth from mom. Her fragmented stories are so ""sugar coated"" it is laughable to anyone who knows the truth about this dark world. I don't care if you graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School or if you have no education and grew up in foster homes -- if you have worked as a stripper for more than one night, undoubtably -- you have experienced moments of extreme degradation -- no one girl (dancer) is different in the eyes of a customer than the next in a strip club -- As a writer, if you are going to step up and write a book about this ""taboo"" subject -- TELL IT LIKE IT IS -- TAKE THE LEAP. This book is NOT an accurate account by any means of the real world of stripping...."
2,AVERAGE READ,"This book is a highly positive and false account of the strip club scene. While Heidi may have been the virgin Mary of go-go this is definitely not the case for most women in the business. HOwever, the tone of the book is upbeat and Matteson does keep the story moving along. THe pain of telling her parents is the most engaging subplot. This is good beach/airplane reading."
2,"Sex Sells,But That Doesn't Mean You Should Buy It!","I choose to read Heidi's book to get a glimpse into the life of a fellow exotic dancer. I was somewhat disappointed with her R rated storyline. If you are going to voice your opinion on such a controversal subject to a massive group of people, don't suger coat it. If only a frequent customer could voice his story of tableside dances and the champagne room. Maybe then you'd hear an actual account of the ""Gentlemen's"" clubs that make girls millions."
5,Great bracket.,I use this bracket in my car and it works great because of the extended reach of it making it easier to control the radio.
1,Nothing provided for installation!,"Contrary to the description that this mount comes with everything for complete installation, it does not include the four screws for the mounting plate. Without the screws the product is useless and doesn't rate even one star. How much can four tiny screws possibly cost?By the way, if you have to buy the screws, they are 4mm x 12mm Pan Head Machine screws. I recommend you pick up four lock washers for a snug fit. Home Depot has the screws and washers in their metric drawers in Hardware for about $2.25."
3,DOES NOT FIT,"IT DOES NOT FIT ANY OF THE AUTO DOCKING UNIT I HAVE, IT LOOK LIKE A GOOD ITEM BUT DOES NOT WORK FOR ME. A WASTE OF MONEY"
3,Almost Complete,"The product arrived on time, as expected, and it appears to be of decent quality. One major issue, no attachment screws included. So I have not been able to mount my sportster 5 to it yet, I now need to find attachment screws, which I think is irritating."
2,falling apart??,"The book itself is a great book, full of interesting explanations of all sorts, and much general information. This book looked OK until I opened it, and the binding was coming apart. It seems the glue had sort of disappeared, probably because the book is 50 or so years old. I still think it worth the money, and I will keep it for a loaner. I have another copy that I bought locally, used, last month here in Indiana, and it has not deteriorated much at all, so moisture, dryness etc must have taken their toll."
3,Silly Putty,"I am not a huge fan of this series although I do like most sci-fi & super-hero type stuff. That being said, this is one of the better Power Ranger videos in my opinion. I liked the plot (Zed casts a spell on Billy & Zack that causes them to see their fellow Rangers as Putties, which are bad guys for you parents.) Of course, he throws in a monster for good measure. But I think Bulk & Skull, the comic relief duo, are the real stars of this series. So, if you like this series or your kids do, then I would recommend this video. If not, then it's little more than silly putty (Pun intended). At worst, it's a half hour of mindless fun."
2,MMPR; Putty on the Brain,This episode is pretty stupid!It's about when Lord Zedd puts a spell on these glasses that Zack and Billy(Dumb and Dumber) have worn to take a test at school. Now they are seeing all the other rangers as putties. Plus Lord Zedd has created a iguana monster to destroy the rangers.Now Zack and Billy must find a way to reverse the spell and team with the other rangers to defeat Zedd's lastest monster.
5,This concert video is AMAZING!,"I have been an avid fan of MWS for a long time, but when I watched this tape, I felt like I was in the front row. It is a great collection of his current and greatest hits. I highly recommend it."
5,Nice stuff,I enjoyed MUSE live concert and music CD tunes a disc-two presents.It is a very generous edition of a music band on any merits-doco is also provided with disc-two.
3,Such a disappointment.,"I love Muse and desperately wanted this DVD. But what a load of **** it is. I'd hoped it was going to be a film of a concert and to be able to see the guys really letting rip. No chance. The style of direction turns, what looks like an amazing gig, into little more than an extended video. If you like the flash-cutting of pop promos, and can stand it for an hour and a half or so, then this may be for you. But if you want one camera to focus on one shot for more than two seconds, you're going to be as disappointed as me. Really, it's like the director was on speed or something. Every other second the film cuts to another camera angle. In a video, fine. But not for the entire length of a concert. The music is fantastic. It would've been nice to see it actually being played, too."
4,Comprehensive but difficult,A comprehensive book deals with the mathematical tools needed in studtying advanced economics. But I suggested that it should include a review of basic calculus and linear algebra.
4,Deserves better reviews. A good science fiction adaptation.,"_Second Chances_ deserves far better reviews than it has been given here. The story adapts an old story, Joseph Conrad's _Lord Jim_ to a science fiction setting. This is a trend seen in other recent novels, such as Michael Flynn's _The Wreck of The River Of Stars_ and Sharon Shinn's _Jenna Starborn_.The prose and plotting are dense and take thought. But a reader who makes the effort will be rewarded. The action develops over time and is not forcefed to the reader. More important is watching the effect of events on the characters. Seeing Jim recover from the actions that made him an outcast among his peers... Seeing Cam Marlow trying to give Jim the help he needs, but won't accept because he feels he doesn't deserve it... Schwartz take recasts an old story into a new sphere and comes up with something definitely worth reading."
2,Decent characters in search of a plot,"If the main characters (Jim, Cam Marlow) could be extracted from this book and placed in something more adventurous, they might be fun to read. Both are noble idealists with a lot of angst to get through, and both are reasonably believable. As it is, though, they're embroiled in a very slow moving story in which much of the action happens offstage or between chapters. They fill their time, instead, with continual introspective explanation of the backstory of the war that's just finished, or the medical problems that Marlow suffers."
3,A SF book with characters to care about,"I picked this up almost by chance at my local library and found myself staying up to read it. I haven't read Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" but what I liked about this book was that it gave me two characters that I really care about, both Jim and Captain Marlow.The prose is sometimes less than clear but I still enjoyed it."
1,Unreadable,"The characters action's are inexplicable. The plot is stolen from one of the most boring books in English Literature. I don't know what happened to my earlier more detailed review, but I feel I must warn the SF reading public not to waste their money."
2,Not worth it,A lot of what is in this book is just plain common sense that you probably already know. The reviewer is correct that this book is also lacking in focus - it's all over the place. I did not find this book either helpful or useful.
3,Common Sense,"I really enjoyed this book at first, but I never actually put what I read to use. Maybe it is due to the fact that I had already read most of what this book contains. It is all pretty common-sense stuff that you have probably heard of before, but if you don't have a reference like this, it is worth buying."
5,space galore,"I found spaces in my small apartment that I didn't know I had. Excellent book.Love my new, uncluttered look and I can finally find things."
4,It's a start...,"This book is very straightforward and quite helpful. It's set up in a very organized manner (room-by-room), but if you have more than a bed and clothes in your bedroom, then you have to skip around to find the tips you'll need. That is a bit annoying, but I guess its not too much of a hassle."
4,A Good Starting Point,"This is a good book full of information and if you're just starting to clean up you life, this is a must read."
3,For the organizationally challenged who are also lacking common sense.,"This book was reviewed so well that I bought one for myself and each of my sisters-in-laws. What a mistake! I should have paid attention to the title. It is 'plain and simple.' If you're like me, and couldn't live without your label maker, find another book. If it's never occurred to you to label, color code or alphabetize anything, this book will have great tips for you."
2,For the plain and simple,"This book is 'oragnized' into sections - Getting Started, Organizing Room by Room, Organizing Finances, Organizing Time, Organizing Home Life, and Organizing Transitions.Who needs an entire section telling you the benefits of being organized - isn't that why I bought the book? The author takes 'plain and simple' to new heights...for example - ""To organize your refrigerator, start by uncluttering it.""I was hoping for something with more substance. There was nothing in this book that I didn't already know. If you're looking for something very basic as far as what to do in your home...you will like this book."
3,OrganizingPlain and Simple,"Overall, the book had good information and ideas for organizing. It just wasn't quite specific enough for what I was looking for. It was too brief on the subject of organizing rooms."
5,Incredibly interesting take on the power of games,"Interesting view of video games as they impact individuals and the culture. Unwilling to be hysterical (as it could have been), the book offers wise guidelines. The games are old but the lessons still apply. Nothing better has been written on the psychological and social impact of games even as some people have tried to fuel the hysteria by banning them and imposing the stupid ratings system."
5,Still an important book,"The wise and even perspective on video games is rare. The book is entertaining, too. The only criticism: the reviews are outdated."
5,Awesome,The book has awesome insights for parents and educators. The reviews are outdated-- old games-- but the rest is as relavant as ever.
1,Video Games; A fine example of incompetence,"Anyone who had an glimmer of pleasure reading GAME OVER, will find Sheff's follow up a dismal failure. It was released several years ago, during Mortal Kombat's height of well deserved popularity. He spends the first few chapters ranting about how terrible violence in video games is, and the rest giving slanted, and often useless game reviews. The only people who might gain a sliver of enjoyment from this pitifull tome are media-phobic hystericals, and game enthusiasts, like myself who might get a laugh out of Sheff's clueless Fredric Wertham esq approach. All others, RUN AWAY! For the love of God!"
2,I'M WATCHING YOU,"The plot didn't make a lot of sense. The Chinese mafia want to deal Colombian cocaine in Shanghai. They travel to Miami to make a deal with the Colombian cartel. They claim the street value of cocaine is twice what it is in the US. The Colombians balk, ethnic slurs are exchanged. People die. The next thing you know drugs are being shipped to Chinatown in Sydney, Australia via Miami.When a woman is kidnapped, Zheng Liu is hired to get her back. At this point the film becomes a free for all. For some reason Latinos can't work with the Chinese.The acting left a lot to be desired as it is in most drug/crime movies where everyone plays the ultimate tough guy. Zheng Liu, the star of the film is a subplot for most of the movie. He uses high tech gadgets and old fighting techniques. No CG fighting effects. There are better films to watch.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs, nudity, no sex."
2,Forget this book if you or your students use Mac computers.,The software included is for PC's only. We are looking for a replacement for this book as students need to be able to get their money's worth in a university setting.
3,This was a sexy movie,"The acting wasn't great. The story was a little disjointed, but if you're looking for some erotic scenes, this is for you. It was fun"
2,Too Soft for Porn,"Soft core porn with a lame, shape shifting, flesh eating, horror story. There was however a bevy of eye candy, a couple of interesting characters and some full frontal, just not hard enough to be porn and not interesting enough for a night at the movies..."
2,How do these movies get made?,"Why is the only small gay movie that's ever been good is SHELTER? horrible, horrible movie. you know when when people in porn try to act and have a ""storyline""? that's what this is like, except there's no hardcore sex, for 90 minutes."
2,just this,it pulls you in then there isn't no real showing of having sex . no nude bodies have real gay loving sex
1,Horrid and misleading scent!,"I purchased this product because my normal Tidy Cats litter was sold out. I left for a weekend vacation before using it, I had a pet sitter with my cat who refilled the litter box before I came home. When I first cleaned the box since coming home I noticed this sickly sweet odor. It smelled like rotted fruit. My first thought was that my cat was sick, because sweet smelling urine is a sign of diabetes or possible kidney disease in animals. I panicked and called my vet and almost put my elderly cat through invasive tests. I filled the box a day before my cat's appointment and noticed the scent was the litter. I'm beyond furious. Never purchasing this again."
1,Poor clumping,"I bought this by default because I get my groceries via Amazon Fresh and they don't have many litter choices. I have tried every type and brand under the sun and this one is sub par. The clumps do not form well and the urine goes straight to the bottom where it forms a sticky mud that is hard to scrape off. The clumps that do successfully form, I assume with small urine volumes, are crumbly and must be handled delicately to prevent separation. I filled my box a week ago and it needs to be completely dumped. I can usually go 2-3 weeks between complete changeovers when I use my preferred litter- Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat. I sure wish Amazon Fresh would carry it. Do you hear me, Amazon gods?"
2,Doesn't Clump,This litter is lousy! Urine doesn't clump and instead goes to the bottom of the litter box and sticks to the sides. Then breaks apart and mixes with the clean litter when you try to scoop it up. It also reeks a strong ammonia smell when scoping it out.
4,Many cats and litter works,"I bought the Tidy Cats Small Space just to try it. The first thing I noticed was the orange smell, to me it was not overwhelming. I have 6 cats and have used every kind of litter made. I do a litter change every 7-10 days and the litter will keep the urine and feces smell in check even at the end of the change cycle. I have one cat who has really smelly ""poops"" and this is the only litter that works for her. My friend who takes care of my cats when I am out of town, even asked what kind of litter I had switched to as she really noticed a difference when she cleaned the boxes. She has now switched and is also pleased. I have used this litter for over a year now. My only wish is that is that it clumped as tight as ""Scoop Away"" it is not as good as that brand in the clumping respect, but I have to say it does clump better than many other brands. I can not tell any difference in the tracking amount from any other litter I have used. For me they all track the same!"
1,"This is the worst of cat litters, even when it is brand new and fresh the smell is putrid, and noxious!!!","This is the worst cat litter I have ever tried. I just bought on Monday and washed out the litter box and filled with Tidy cat small spaces. The next morning my entire bedroom smelled like a foul citrusy dirty cat box, even though the box was fresh. The smell is nauseating and so strong, I had to move the box outside into the living room just to be able to sleep. I will never repurchase and have to wash and throw away all the entire new box in just 3 days of useage. The smell of the new litter is worse than that of a dirty old literbox, it is so bad!!"
5,super order control,I have used many types litter to find the almighty magic litter. Well this one is the closest I have come to the perfect litter. I do agree with a previous reviewer about the tracking issue but the order control and and clumping out shadow the tracking problems for me. I now have a place that doesn't smell like cat. I use it with the omega paws self cleaning litter box. The combo of the two make litter box duty a breeze.
4,First experience with scoopable litter,I bought this litter because I was in a hurry for something to use for two rescue kittens I was bringing into the house. Their litter box was going to be in our family room to isolate them from my other cats.Have no complaints about the litter's performance - clumping is great and didn't present a huge problem with tracking either.Seem to be in the minority when it comes to odor. I have chemical sensitivities and was surprised I didn't react (like throat feeling swollen) to the fragrance.My son and I really disliked the odor of the urinated litter though. It was such a peculiar smell and scooping soiled litter became a disgusting chore. I did not to buy this brand again.
1,Worst. Litter. Ever.,"Whoever said this smelled like rotten oranges after the first poop is completely correct. This litter is terrible. I think the main problem is that it doesn't dry out the poop, so the smell lingers and mixes with the orange scent to create a horrific odor. Even scooping the litter box twice a day is not enough, and each time is an ordeal as you're forced to face the powerful odor up close. Worse yet, it tracks like crazy. The only one positive this litter has is that there is no dust storm created when pouring into a litter box. I switched to Fresh Step Scoopable Multi-Cat, which does create a dust storm, but it's 100% better at controlling odor (since it does dry out poop). After trying a slew of different cat litters, I think I'll stick with that one. Odor is a huge issue for a small 1BR apartment, and Tidy Cat Small Spaces does NOT live up to its name."
2,Spenser Lite,"A Columbine shooting at a private school provides the setting for this story. Spenser is hired to prove the innocence of one of the shooters.I enjoyed the book but it seemed like it was Robert Parker Light, less taste and less filling. It had a good story line and the plot was good but it just didn't seem to have enough meat on the bones. I've noticed that when I'm hungry my analogies all seem food related. One of my favorite aspects of Parker's Spenser novels is the verbal repartee between Hawk and Spenser. Since Hawk was not a participant in this story that was missing. This is not a beach book, this more like finish it in one sitting while waiting in the dentist's office. This was a very short, very quick read, too light and too quick to be satisfying.Cold Service (Spenser)"
3,Spenser sans Susan sans Hawk = Bland,"A fan of Robert B Parker's Spencer books will definitely want to read School Days. There is some of the normal banter and a decently evolved murder mystery to unravel, but I didn't feel any excitement. After reading about 30 of these novels, Parker may have hit a barrier in the road. Still somewhat enjoyable, this story just doesn't invoke the intense yearnings to get back to the story that others have. I wouldn't miss it, but I wouldn't put it on my priority list either."
4,can a cookbook be far behind,"As usual, Parker writes a real page turner. What I'd really like is for Parker to put out a Spenser cookbook."
3,Good news and bad news,"The good news is that Susan is out of town, at a conference in North Carolina. The bad news is that except for a passing reference to him, Hawk does not appear in this novel. The further bad news is that though Susan is out of town there is still some cutesy-poo talk about her. Aside from all that, the story and the prose are lean and crisp and to the point.As I've written elsewhere, Parker has said that he has more to say about Spenser than Hawk because he doesn't know Hawk as well. How this could be the case, when Parker created him, I don't know, but it's a pity. A Hawk-less Spenser novel can still function effectively (as this one does), but it's like a well made cake without any icing."
3,School Days (Spenser Novels),Another good adventure written by Mr. Parker containing lots of intrigue to keep the listener on pins and needles. The reader adds to the suspense.
1,A New Low for Spenser,"Almost no action, no Hawk and very little Susan. I yearned for something to hapen for far too many pages."
3,Like a potato chip,"I heard an interview with Robert Parker on Public Radio. It was interesting, so I decided to read one of his novels. Then I read a bunch more. This review can apply to just about any of them, because they are all pretty much the same, just with different settings. I didn't think the first one was especially good, or well-written, or interesting, but I kept on reading all the same.To me, Parker novels are like potato chips. You know the next one will be just like the last one, no better, no worse. It will be salty, greasy, and crisp, and not especially good for you. But you know you are going to eat one more, and one more....until they are all gone."
4,alone at last,"I'll just report, then, that this was a better-than-average installment among recent Spenser novels and it was refreshing that it was JUST a Spenser novel: It wasn't about Hawk or Susan or Vinnie or anybody else. Don't get me wrong, the supporting cast in this series is great. But maybe every five books or so we should get a story just like this one, with Spenser trudging through the woods in the rain looking for clues and alone with his thoughts."
2,Just an Ok book,I have bought and read all of Robert Parkers books. I dont know why I do because they are getting tiring. The story line is weak. He spends more time having Spenser make comments about all the women that pass by then he does on the plot. If you take out all the sexual parts and the wisecracks he does... there is very little to the main story.
4,Good and Quick Read,"A terse and sometimes tense thriller from the master of brevity and capturing crucial details in an engaging portrait that deals with serious themes--honor, trust, redemption. He is a modern-day master of the crime novel. This was my first Parker book and it lead me to read another one right away."
4,"Finally, Spenser By Himself","I was ready to give up on Parker (I skipped Bad Business) since recently he does not seem able to concentrate on writing entertaining books. Maybe if he quit cashing so many checks for his myriad of series he could put out a good product.---Anyway, I am glad I read this fun and exciting novel. Parker scrapes away most of the supporting characters and most of his garbage psycobabble to produce a tight Spenser adventure. I must say that Spenser is more interesting when he is somewhat alone. Get rid of Susan and the dog. Use Hawk sparingly to bring back his mysteriousness. Most importantly, never use the hundreds of cheap thugs/friends/helpers that populate this series. (Potshot anyone?) Thanks to Parker for one last good book. I doubt he'll keep it up."
2,Unfinished Business,"The book was a typical Spenser novel, however without Hawk, and Susan.The plot was a little weak, and it ended with a lot of ""loose strings"".I wanted to know what happened to many of the characters that were prevelant in this novel. Parker should have completed the book. It left me empty, and wanting to see some justice. I won't say more because the people who have not read the book would pick up on clues that should be left up to the reader.All in all to be quite fair, it was a page turner, entertaining, just lacking in the conclusion."
2,Have to agree with Stuart (form Aug 10 2006 review),"While I jumped into the character sporadically (I think this is the second one I read with him as the main character) it flowed fast and his smart remarks I always find humorous. While the plot is quite weak and I actually guessed part of it, it was a fun read. It went quick and should have built more into the red herring that the cover leads you to believe. Even the school principal lacked some Ooommmph if you know what I mean. The grandmother was a good role, but the parents coud have been much more important.So overall, let's call it a quick read, funny and enjoyable, but not one of his best. I picked it up at the airport and read it on the very same trip. Not one I would keep, so back it went with the 50% return offer the airport here has."
1,dreadful,"There is very little to be said for this book. Lousy dialogue, no suspense, and nothing that made me want to read on. We could also do without Pearl. Mr. Parker has reached a new low."
2,School Days Not So Good,I didn't care for this novel. There no real suspense or surprise . I have read better Spensers books. This is lightweight reading wait for the next novel.
4,"Good product, but no fm transmitter","I really like Sirius in the week I have had it. It does have a couple of limitations - I drive through redwoods and the tall trees block the satillite signal - but in open space it offers a great choice of good radio. Best of all will be live transmissions of NFL games this fall. This particular Model of the Dock does not come with the FM transmitter and is misrepresented on Amazon as having one. The RCA cable provides the best transmission if you have one on your car radio - mine has a cd player plugin up front, and so this model is fine - but if you do not have a plug, you need the SIRCK1 also available on Amazon. I have one of each for two vehicles. Crutchfield Electronics does a good job of explaining the ins and outs of satillite radio at http://www.crutchfield.com/S-PoBcP2NKj9q/sirius/."
4,big but worth it,"I have had sirius for 5 years and the base on my radio became loose. I replaced it immediately and can still listen to the sirius I love. This model is a little big a nd clunky looking- the newer models are much sleeker, but it does the job just as well."
3,Please uncover Brian Ferry,"What an eclectic mix! Covers of Dylan and the classic ""Goodnight Irene"" interspersed with original material by Ferry and Dave Stewart. The former are distinctly not to my taste, while the latter are classic, wonderful, ethereal Ferry. In other words, I like half the CD and can do without the covers. Still, it's a worthwhile addition to my collection."
3,"No more covers, Bryan!!","Please, Bryan, on your next album write all the songs yourself. I love your work, and have no interest in hearing you try to sing Dylan or (God save us) Amazing Grace. Please, please, please."
5,A classy C.D from a very classy guy,"I have been a Roxy Music fan since seeing them on Top Of The Pops playing Virginia Plain in the early 70's in England. I also managed to catch them last year in Vancouver, B.C during their reunion tour. They were truly brilliant. Bryan Ferry has always been a class act. He is not only a brilliant performer but a marvellous and talented singer/songwriter. Frantic is truly a masterpiece. I won't bore you with the details but Cruel and Goddess of Love are classics. Having read all the reviews so far posted on amazon.com, I concur wholeheartedly. If you like Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music this C.D is an absolute must. It's also nice to see Eno back in the picture."
3,Luke warm Ferry,"Bryan Ferry has to be one of my all time favorite singers. But how does an artist like him surpass such classic albums like ""Mamouna"" and ""As Time Goes By""? Unfortunately, Mr. Ferry falls horribly short of doing so with his tepid follow-up album ""Frantic."" It's not a bad album, but it's definitely uninspired. So much of the album is taken up by weak cover songs (enough of the Bob Dylan already!) and forgettable melodies. ""Goddess of Love"" and ""Hiroshima"" are the most memorable songs, but it's not enough to save this album. It's also heartbreaking to hear how Ferry's voice has weakened with time. Well, maybe he can team up with Phil and Andy again and make another Roxy Music album. Here's to hoping!"
4,Growing on me,"When I first listened, I was very disappointed by the straightforward songs with nothing challenging. But then, that was Roxy Music, not Bryan Ferry. Since then, the entire thing has grown on me in a big way.The continuing downer is that Ferry's voice has grown raspy (probably from the cancer sticks that he sports on the CD photos), which just doesn't suit him.Making up for that, however, is the absolutely awesome collaboration with my hero, Brian Eno. ""I Thought"" is simply incredible. It's the last track on the CD, and I'll gladly listen to the whole thing to get to it, and then usually play it more than once. :-)"
5,Best of 2002,"I'm a harsh critic, and I have never given out a five star rating to a new album on Amazon.com until now. Bryan Ferry has made a gem. Once again, Ferry has taken cover songs and truely made them his own, from two Dylan songs (now I understand the words) to ""Goodnight Irene"" to inspired songs based on Richard the Lionhearted. The origonal songs are bluesy, rockin, and even a little pop. And ""I Thought"" reuniting with Roxy Music's Brian Eno make one cry out for more. Not too edgy, not too commercial. Simply Brilliant!"
3,Disappointed,"This book is not comparable in depth and quality to his dad's ""Mutual Fund Wealth Builder"".1)I was not happy that bear funds were not covered. In light of the recent bear market, I was looking for technics on how to time these funds to profit from the next downturn. This entire subject was not even touched upon.2)I was not happy with the minimal coverage of how to best handle the inevitable whipsaws that will occur with his moving average buy-sell system. This is very important. How these whipsaws are handled by the investor will determine whether he/she sticks with the system or not. If he/she chooses not to stick with the system, it will most likely be a sell out of all positions at the wrong time and may prove very costly to his/her account.3)Although I subjectively felt it should be lower, I did not rate this less than 3-stars because I very much liked his goal-setting technic."
5,A book I can understand!,"I have read many self-help books, especially on finance and this one is the best. It's very simple to understand. Doug gets to the point. He holds your hand. He explains everything in simple terms. Unlike many professors that teach a class and you leave the classroom clueless. I finish the book in 3 weeks. I always return to it and cross reference. A must have."
5,AN EXCELENT SEQUEL,This is an excellent sequel to the Ashes Series. I recommend anyone how has followed the Ashes story from the begining to read this book.
1,Keep your money...,"Like in the last books of ""The Ashes"" series Mr. Johnstone has decided to include modern day events that did not happen in the timeline (ie: Iraq).This series has a main character just like Ben, always hooking up with a lady. I could have predicted that. I could also predict that the first group of Rebels Jim came into contact with think Jim thinks like Ben.It appears that Mr. Johnstone has decided to write a book, and perhaps a series, for the mere sake of making money. I think you are better off keeping your money and spending it elsewhere."
2,I wish I could kill these ghost writers,Everyone William W. Johnstone is dead he died in 2004. The point is that whoever is writing these books is not Mr. Johnstone anymore then the guy writing the deathlands/outlander books is really James Axler. I give it two stars but no more then that. Basic plot nothing that sets it apart from any other book of adventure fiction don't bother.
3,Not bad,It was a good book. The lead person is believeable and it speaks of a different kind of hero. One who isn't ready to fight at the drop of a hat.
4,A transition,"In a way, the first book of the Last Rebel series is the end of the Ashes series. I enjoyed this book and believe it is a ""must read"" for anybody who enjoyed the Ashes series.Though William Johnstone has departed this plane of existence and ""ghost writers"" have been writing the various series since his passing the basic ""pablum for the masses"" does not require the highest caliber of writers to create stories of this type.I am one of the Ashes series fans who despaired of the route the author trod as the series matured. How I longed for a reappearance of the Prophet and despaired of the continual reemergence of the same old bad guys. But, these stories were intentional fluff written to entertain without requiring much thought. Sometimes we need some basic pablumy-like fluff to settle back with on a chill drizzly afternoon. For that, the Ashes and its follow-on, the Last Rebel series, is good enough for me."
1,I'd give it half a star if I could,"As a big fan of the Ashes series, I've been disappointed of late with the last few books. Other reviewers have said that Mr. Johnstone is dead. I don't know if that is a fact or not. What I do know is that this book absolutely sucks. Poorly edited. No real plot. Survive plague, drive around, find dog, kill bad guys, find and fall in love with incredibly hot woman, kill more bad guys, girl gets kidnapped, hunt down kidnappers, kill them, and oh yeah, a big plot twist, this time the hero isn't quite in time, and the girl gets horribly disfigured. Those are the good points of the book. In an attempt to tie into the Ashes series, the new hero was with Raines when he died, and there are some Rebels left. However, there are no longer any women in the Rebel army, AND the timeline has been completely rewritten. The only positive thing to come out of this for was that I bought this waste of perfectly good paper USED!"
5,The last rebel survivor,What can I say. Another one of WIlliam W. Johnstone's Ashes books. I love the Ashes series. And this one is great too.
4,good,Is this a start of a new series of Ashes? Sounds like it because of the way it is written that more books will follow
3,Another Sarah Waters Book of the Year,"This is a Sarah Waters book so that should say it all. She is an excellent writer. This is a 1998 book, so well used but readable. I have not read it all yet but it is very good so far. This is an erotica book so remember that when purchasing."
5,Couldn't wait for -- but dreaded -- the end!!,"This is one of the few books in recent years that I've thought about during the day, when I was at work or doing chores, and couldn't wait to get to at night. It's very sensual, very true to life experience. A must-read for any grrl!"
5,Tipping the Velvet means...,"""Tipping the Velvet"" is Victorian slang for female oral sex. Great book, beautifully written with vivid detail and emotion. Authors gives surprising insight into notoriously conservative era."
4,A luscious adventure,"Nancy King escapes from her small English hometown in Victorian England with her soon-to-be lover Kitty to London. The two become partners in business and love until Kitty betrays Nan for her career. From there, Nan becomes a rent boy, then a kept girl in lesbian high society, until she is thrown back into the streets. Meeting a woman from her past, Nan heals her heart and finds true love. Winner of a Lambda Literary Award, Waters's gorgeous story is equal parts historical novel and bawdy lesbian epic. My only regret is that I waited so long to read this book! I felt a bit distant at times from the characters, so I am hesitant to give it 5 of 5, but I'm quite on the border."
5,Always a Delight to Reread,"I loved this book, a coming-of-age story, a love story, a historical which gave a glimpse to a world I never knew existed.I actually read this book ages ago, but wanted to give the author a nod right now, today, this very moment.Why?Because Amazon's new rule on sales ranking is horrid, discriminatory, all but bans brilliant books like Ms. Waters' to the back of the bus.I wonder what the author thinks about this new rule. It infuriates me beyond belief, Amazon's lame reasoning for cutting off authors like Ms. Waters, especially after all these years. C'mon, Amazon!Amazon just lost my sales."
1,Ewww!,"I'm one of the lezziest lesbians who ever lezzed and this book managed gross me out with a girl/girl sex scene (leather phallus, 'nuff said)! I have to agree with all the other 1 and 2-star reviews on this site: save your money! If you really must get this book, be warned; it starts out as a deceptively fun, light read before quickly getting bogged down by ridiculous plots, offensively stereotypical characters and the least sexy erotic passages I've read in a while. If you liked the movie, just know that the director had to make some major plot changes just to make this mess make sense."
1,victorian fluff pandering to lesbians,"this book made me angry. it was recommend by a neighbor, presumably because she knows i'm [gay]. i finally picked it up and was disgusted. what fluff! what unabashed pandering to the lesbian literary audience. i was unmoved by Nan's emotional plight, and just as unmoved by her poorly crafted sex scenes. down with badly written fiction, be it [gay] or otherwise."
1,"""Lesbian"" erotica...Oh please","A friend of mine suggested I read this book saying that it was ""good lesbian erotica"". I must disagree. There were more phallic descriptions in this book than I've ever seen in any heterosexual book. The constant association of lesbians to men made me frown. It's something true lesbians fight on a daily basis. There was nothing in this book that turned me on. I hope that people exploring a lesbian lifestyle do not point to this book as a sole example of what lesbians find erotic. There are out lesbians that simply enjoy being women and loving women. If you are someone into ""phallic writing"" then this is the book for you. I for one had enough phallic imagry after reading this book to last a lifetime. While the book created detailed imagry and history it did not provide the erotica I had hoped. A true disappointment."
1,"Just becasue it's erotica, doesn't mean it's good","I am amazed by all the hype surrounding this book. I found it boring and a chore to get through. I really enjoyed the descriptions at the beginning of the book, but it fell apart very soon after. The main character was very unlikable and selfish. I didn't care what happened to her. The ""erotic"" scenes were poorly written and not enjoyable. I also found the series of events that Nan went through to be totally over-the-top and unbelievable. People in the story often acted out of character to suit situations and move the story forward. I can only guess that people are so taken with the idea of reading lesbian erotica that they fail to pay attention to the actual book. I truly hated it - A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!"
5,Kudos to Sarah Waters,"This is a excellent book. I couldn't put it down, and when I did have to, I couldn't wait to get back to it. It is an excellent view into Victorian England with great attention to detail. I felt such sympathy for Nancy Astley. Your heart will soar and break with hers. In the few days it took me to read this novel, nothing in my world seemed to matter but Nan. It is so touching, compelling and wonderfully erotic. I only hope there will be a sequel (hopefully you read this, Ms. Waters). Do yourself a favor and buy this book. Enjoy."
3,Well-written but underdeveloped,"I enjoyed the author's sparkling prose and ability to set a scene. Her vivid portraits of people and places were excellent, and her depiction of another era certainly absorbed me. As several people have noted, the character of Nan King is quite lacking. I found her to be selfish, spoiled, and shallow--I didn't care what happened to her after a certain point in the book. I did not believe in her final love, which is a shame since the book started out so promisingly. I'd rather read about a person who endures hardship with their awareness of other humans intact. Nan did not redeem herself in the end."
5,tipping the velvet,"I love Sarah Waters' novels. They stay with you after you read them. Her characters are alive and credible. The settings really let you live the times and in the places, in this case, London in the turn of the century."
5,Pull out your throw pillows and sit down with tea,"TIPPING THE VELVET is one of the best novels I've read this year. Nancy's story pulls you in until you feel what she feels. There's beauty and angst and all kinds of emotions. Sarah Waters's first novel is impressive without pretention. I was sad when I realized the book was over, but I wasn't sad with the ending. For me, it was part Henry Fielding (of TOM JONES fame), part female Oscar Wilde and part pure romance. Definitely a five star book! I hope Sarah Waters has plans for more books."
4,Universal Love Story,"A feel-good love story for all readers! Highly recommended. One of the best reads of the year. I read ""Affinity"" before I read ""Tipping..."" and liked it slightly more, but Ms. Waters has become one of my favorite authors already. I am pre-ordering her third book."
4,"Very well written, but is there a message?","Tipping the Velvet is as well written a book as one is likely to read. It would be difficult not to be impressed by the way the author, born in 1966, writes as if she had been born in 1866. However, the message is confounding. On one level it seems as if the point is that all of us who have been disillusioned and suffered a broken heart must spend time resurrecting ourselves. But it seemed to me that Nancy never regained her sweet heart after she lost her sweetheart. And her behavior as she tried to recover was reprehensible even for someone who has been jilted. Except for Alice did her family deserve her withdrawal? Was renting her only alternative for someone as talented as she? Somehow it seems as if Waters is condoning the reaction that Nancy had to her loss. Still the book is worth reading."
4,Hard to Put Down Any Way You Look At It,"Nan King is just the kind of selfish, willful character to live through such harrowing experiences. Great read (some typos, where was the editor?) and overall fun, exciting, wild ride. King's character comes dangerously close to my hate list, but redeems herself in the end."
5,Wow! This one is fantastic!,"I have never read a book quite like TIPPING THE VELVET. Like the back cover suggests, it is absolutely gorgeous. The writing is virtually flawless, somewhat poetic, and the story has a wonderful mixture of happy, sad, twists and turns. Reading this book, after a character was introduced and played a bit, then forgotton when the story moved on, I was afraid I would never find out what happened to them. But Ms. Waters saved the best for last and tied up everything in the end. Even if you don't have anything in ""common"" with the characters, you will delight in this book."
4,The title is as beautiful and engrossing as the book.,"Cleverly disgusing the title as much as the women did with their identity in the late 1800's, Waters will be the author more widely read by audiences without bending down to reach them. An extra amount of detail for characters, a true to story speed of events, allows for easy suspension of disbelief. Rather, the historic detail mixes into plausible invention. Whatever isn't true in the book has undoubtedly occurred outside of it, and if not it is hoped for so hardheartedly by the reader, truth is of little relevance. The only grief for the reader is awaiting the next story. Waters undoubtedly whispered ""presto"" upon competion as the reader yells ""bravo."""
4,Interesting Period Piece,"I first read ""Fingersmith"" and became an instant Sarah Waters fan. I did not like this book quite as well, but will continue to read more of Sarah Waters' offerings."
5,???Dont Understand the Title????,"Dear friends here, I am a non-native speaker of English,but I am very intererested in the book. I have a serious question to ask. If anybody can answer it, I will be very grateful and pleased. The question is: I dont understand the meaning of the title: TIPPING THE VELVET. I know what ""tip"" is, and I know ""velvet"", but I dont know what is the connotation of TIPPING VELVET. I think this image must be very important, and I am sad that I dont get it. Please teach me if you can."
3,This book is utterly okay...,"I admire Sarah Water's style, 19th century Cockney lesbian fiction. In small doses.And yet, I really have little to say about this book except that while you are reading it, it is difficult to put down. The debachary, the sex, the music, the lesbianism all conspire to make it something quite different.That said, it leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth and unsatisfied sigh. There is something very premediated about the whole thing, and like other reviewers have suggested, Sarah Water's main downfall is her desire to create the lesbian novel of the 21st century. Its just that little bit too long to maintain.Infact, I have to wonder how original her other two works are considering they, like this one, are long 19th century Cockney lesbian fiction."
4,Good read,"It took me awhile to get into this book, but once I did it was a great read. Good escape novel."
3,Not as great or Dickensian as the reviews claim.,"After the glowing reviews I had to read this book. But I have read 138 pages, and am not overly thrilled with it. Yes, it has a homosexual theme, so must the author Sarah Waters use the word ""gay"" on every other page? I know she means ""gay"" in the olde tyme happy Victorian sense, but it's really heavy handed. And ""fag"" for cigarette? Yes, it's British, but seems so obvious, like she looked for a glossary of Victorian argot. And of course naming the protagonist Nan King (as in drag king, get it?). I don't really feel the Victorian-ness. It seems like a modern author who just did a little research. Not Dickensian in many ways. Waiting for the ""good"" parts. Ta."
3,"Not my 'scene', but interesting nonetheless","I picked this book up out of curiosity more than anything else. And to be honest it didn't really make me desperate to read any more of this author's work or genre. It is a fascinating story with more ups and downs than a music hall curtain, but perhaps it is the author's style that makes even the most saucy and intimate moments seem almost detached. Everything is described in almost clinical detail, and thus we are given an insight into a world we maybe never knew existed. But somehow I finished Tipping the Velvet with an unsatisfied feeling. The ending was just too 'pat' after all of Nancy's adventures. I couldn't find her, Kitty, Diana or Florence in the least attractive. I would recommend it, but just not with as much enthusiasm as I would have wished."
5,A day and a half...,"YES, a day and half is all it took me to read this book-- I could literally not put it down. Well, that is somewhat of a lie: I forced myself to put it by the wayside for a few moments in order to prolong the pleasure of reading it. Tipping the Velvet is exquisite and a perfect read for the summer. The novel is so rich with details from life at the turn of century that it is possible to forget where you are. Everyone should read this book, regardless of orientation. The story of (supposed?) love and loss are universal, and I believe any feeling person can understand that! You will find yourself craving oysters by the end-- Treat yourself! Read this book!"
4,Winning Character,"I really enjoyed the character of Nancy Astley. Her discovery of her lesbianism and sexuality is gradual and believeable. She is such a likeable character that you care what happens to her and you are pulling for things to turn out for her. Even while she stoops to some low tricks to survive, you can't help but feel she is a decent person struggling to do her best. The sex is sprinkled throughout the book liberally enough to keep things smoldering but are blended into her self-discovery and her passionate connection with the people around her. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that at points it seemed to slow down and run a little long. If I could give it 4 and a half stars I would!"
5,A true pleasure to read.,"Tipping the Velvet is an easily read book that, like Graham Greene's End of the Affair, captures well the feelings that people have that had before seemed beyond description. Waters does a fantastic job of being truthful to the heroine's feelings by showing Nancy's conflicting emotions. We've all had them! The story is a good read for many reasons - simply, the plot is interesting, it doesn't stagnate. Waters moves the story along and while it is clear that she's paid attention to history, I never felt bogged down in the details of it or felt like I needed a history lesson. This is because the book is ultimately, timeless because it is more about emotions and human nature than anything else. It is a well written book that reads easily."
1,Disappointing read,"By looking at the other reviews, it appears I am in the minority, but I did not enjoy this book at all. In fact, I had a hard time finishing it. (Very syrupy ending..)The main character, Alice, is very self absorbed and I found it difficult to like her and therefore empathize with her in various situations. I also never got a feel for what Matthew, the victim was really like which made it harder to care. Also, the whole sub-theme about volunteering in the prison was extremely unrealistic. The relationship she supposedly develops with the prisoners would never really happen. First, that a 17 yr. old girl would inspire all of them to write poetry, second, that they would all confide in her and third, that this group of hard core murderers would act like a bunch of girls all excited for Alice's prom plans. I have never written a negative review before, but I though maybe someone would appreciate an honest opinion. Very superficial read."
5,Really great book; poignant; eye opening,"I have never written a review here before, but I just finished reading this book and I found it so intriguing and touching. I can only imagine how this book could help teens, or really anyone, who has lost someone so young to a violent crime or accident. I felt like I could really understand the grief a teenager could feel losing a close friend. As an adult, you can forget how strong bonds can be between young people. This book reminded me of how fragile we all are. Really great."
4,Angst in the fast lane,"There are many reasons not to feel sympathy for Moynahan's characters--poor little rich kids at a school for priviledged youth, with all the attendant problems. She reaches beyond the superficiality, however, and gives us Alice, who, at seventeen, is facing the death of the boy she loved, with the self-centered angst only a teenager can demonstrate.The teens are drawn very convincingly, the adults less so, and this is a surprising and satisfying read."
1,I knon't recomend this,"I Got this camera one year ago. The film get's jammed almost every month. It broke On a big trip adn I had to buy disposable's the whole time adn they are awful. I was very dissapointed. This camera is not at all worth getting. Spend your money on something that will work, and last."
2,This book is average.,"I bought this book for my kids and found it to be very average. Some of the poetry is by Jack Prelutsky and Jeff Moss, and that helps, but you'd be better off just buying their OWN work...Skip this, and go for a book with some sort of direction."
1,Miles of Smiles,"I admit that I did not get past the first poem pointed out by a humiliated first grade bed wetter: ""Never tell your friends at school that you still wet your bed. They are sure to tease you, and you'll wish that you were dead."" This should NOT be used as classroom reading! Does Lansky understand that this is a common problem that is very embarrassing to a young child? Every lower elementary class is bound to contain bed wetters. Ain't funny, McGee!!"
3,Really old!,This book was a slow ship and is not in very good condition. Has good information though and should help anyone planning to take the AP exam at the end of the course.
3,some good parts,"There are definitely some very good parts in this book and I found myself doing a lot of highlighting in some chapters. But as a whole, I found the book to be tedious"
4,Emotion does not equate to sin,"Dr. Dan Allender, makes a powerful case for the ""righteousness"" of emotion at its purist God given form. For most of my life I have been taught that emotion is wrong, from the devil, and from our brokenness. This book challenges that belief and has cleaned up emotion's reputation as it is usually drug through the mud of the sin we allow it to create in and through us. Emotion is blamed for the sin the carrier produces; much like Christ or the church is blamed for the sin Christians produce. Thank you for clearing up emotions reputation. This book has given me permission to feel. I now have a clearer picture of the Gospel of Christ!"
3,Puzzling,This was not an easy movie to watch. Very different story. I liked the leads. I just found it very tragic.
4,Loved it!!,"This film was very well made. I appreciate all the writing, directing and acting with the beautiful scenery included. For me it was a must have in my movie collection."
4,Purple Sea,"The movie was a challenging & engaging story, well worth watching. Not simple, not a skin flick, but a story of love within a culture & family & time frame. The disc I received on order disappointed me in the final third of the film by slowing & stopping for several minutes and really detracting from the enjoyment of the film. The disc finally righted itself and finished up without incident but what happened, happened. Wish I didn't have to report that."
3,purple sea,"Not as good as I'd hoped, but then good lesbian moves are rare - not Amazon's fault, just wish you could find good solid stories."
1,Memorex CD/DVD White Labels Worthless,"These labels can end up destroying your cd or dvd player, weight shifting causing wabble, and glue comes off into your player and on your disk making them unplayable. You have to use 90% alcohol to get the glue off your disk, and warm the disk with a hair dryer to peel the labels off. The extra weight can burn up your player sooner or later. Need to find a light weight vinyl without the glue problems. Anybody know of any?"
2,Easy,"I didn't use the included software, but created a database with templates for printing on the 8.5"" x 11"" sheets. Is easy to get artist, title, 30 song titles, release year, and a 1"" square cover art rendition printed on the labels.You'll need a device to apply the labels correctly. The labels look best on silver or pure white topped CDr blanks. Silver with silver printing is acceptable, but the lettering will still be visible through the labels in good light.In addition to the two circular labels there are four other labels per sheet. Skinny ones for the edge of jewel cases, and larger rectangular ones.Had to edit my review and remove stars. Some labels are cut differently. The difference (~1/8"") caused my carefully aligned graphics to print off center and run off label edges. This is a quality control issue."
4,Works in even balky printers,My mom volunteered to let me print my wedding CD labels in her swanky ad agency office but she made me do one test sheet first. She said that labels of all sorts were always getting jammed in her super high-end printer. She was speechless when we were able to print sheet after sheet of labels (30 sheets altogether) with no jams! She made me give the box to her production assistants so they could always buy just the same type when they needed labels for CD-ROM presentations.
1,N ogo/labelmaker,"Downloaded the labelmaker software,but could not get any images. It called 4 a Cd,which I don't have. Went back 2 Neato product,which is user friendly. Don Christian"
2,Disapointing Software,"First of all, I would like to say that I am VERY disapointed in the software given in this package. When you create a label and print it, it is off center, and you are left with a bunch of white space on your label. The adheisive is fine, so is the cheap plastic device usually included with any label maker in this price range. But the software is what really defeats the purpose. I used up all of the included cd labels (10) just trying to make 2 different labels centered properly. VERY DISAPOINTED"
2,"But, why!","These are excellent labels, at an equally excellent price...But, WHY do they fold the sheet in half to fit it into the box! Only after VERY CAREFULLY unfolding the individual sheets, and ""unbending"" the several creases, folds and ""curly-cues"" are you able to put them through your laser printer. THEN, I would say that approximately 1/3 of them get jammed in the works, ruining one or both labels that come on a sheet. Furthermore, with my printer I have to disassemble my equipment in order to fish out the crumpled labels sheet."
3,"Worse than Avery, No longer folded","They have since packaged these differently and they now come in a big flat envelope the way Avery labels do. I thought the folding was a little crazy myself. These labels are fine, but they are a bit thin, so if you are really really picky and don't want to see the imprint already printed on the CD, you may want to buy Avery. They are twice as good, but twice the price. But if you're using a ton of them, these are fine and will save you lots o' moola. Be sure and get an applicator. These are essential."
1,Beware of DVDs that don't work,I have had a significant problem with these labels on DVDs. Several months after application of the label my DVDs didn't work on any of my DVD players. I finally discovered that removing the labels from the DVDs restored performance. Soaking the DVDs in water helped remove the labels.
3,Easy to Use But the Software has it's limitations,"I have been using the labels and kit for over a year now. The labels are fine, easy to use, print and apply. I use the white labels and (usually)nothing shows thru. The software is frustrating, tho, as it will freeze on you for no apparent reason adding unneccessary time to the process. Because of that, I have switched to using the Adaptec(Roxio) label maker software included with the 5.0 platinum version(tho it's not perfect either...at least it doesn't freeze)for making the Jewel cases. As a result, I am now printing the jewel cases on regular 20lb copy paper and saving a bundle!"
4,New match box looks antique.,"Nice addition for mounting near your fireplace, to hold your matchs. (Not too close!) Have seen a similiar item at a local flea market marked @ $16.00 . Implication was that it was antique which I doubt. (4 star because of defective paint job, otherwise a 5 star item.)"
3,Thin Metal Construction,Product is great to store matches in the kitchen or cottage. The metal used is thin but sturdy enough to hold your matches.
5,Officer Safety,"As a federal law enforcement officer, I frequently encounter people entering the US illegally,not only from Mexico but also Central and South America. Being able to identify gang members quickly enables me to segregate and closely observe the individuals for any indication of hostile action. This book is a great source for identifying those persons who might have gang connections or other sociopathic tendencies."
5,book review,"I have found the book to be quite useful. The information is not up to the second, but it is a great starting point and reference.It was shipped promptly and arrived in excellent condition."
3,Limited coverage,"I may be off base as far as gang activity in other areas of the country but this book focuses so much on the tats of white supremists I didn't find it to be as useful as I had hoped. I am working with younger, homegrown local gang members on the east coast who are loosely affiliated with the Bloods. While this has a bit of info, there is much more out there that this author did not touch on."
2,This camera is not waterproof!,"I ordered this camera thinking it was waterproof as the other review said it was. When I opened the box the instructions said not to submerse in water. Amazon should put some kind of info on their electronics if they want us to shovel out our cash to them. Delivery was prompt and Amazon is the best place to shop online, I am just dissapointed since recieving an waterproof camera was important to me!"
1,Body Glove 5 section Tow Rope,Received the item with no problems. Took it out the same day to give it a try on the water. Used for around 3 hrs and now it is almost unusable. The handle material is coming unwrapped and it is near impossible to hold on to. The foam piece that aids the handle in floating has split 3/4 in half. I am sure if I had used it any more there would be no wrap or foam piece left at all. Hopefully Amazon or Body Glove will make this transaction right.
4,Underwater Photography - Great Book!!!,This book is great!!! I can't wait to be able to use this on my next vacation
2,Whining Harry,"In this book all Harry does is whine about doing all the activies at camp that the counselor has planned because all he wants to do is swim. The book also points out that Harry is not good at any of the activities, until they get to swimming. Not a great example for my 2 year old to follow. He does however enjoy the book."
5,my son's favorite book,My 4 year old son wants to read this book every night. He repeats some of the phrases and can anticipate what will happen. He thinks it's very funny and laughs when we talk about the story line. It's a good book!
2,Antigona KINDLE,How can AMAZON boast any greatness with you're KINDLE if you can't provide something so simple as school texts like Antigona Perez in KINDLE format?
2,"Nice idea, lousy execution","What a nice idea to collect some early, rare Buddy Clark vocals from the 30s. What a lousy remastering job, as in: THE PITCH IS WRONG ON EVERY TRACK ON THE ALBUM, each track running slightly faster than the recorded speed. If your CD player can correct pitch, you might get this one at such a (justifiably) low price, otherwise you'll be treated to Buddy Clark sounding like a tenor instead of a baritone. Sony/Columbia stinks for reissuing the same 16 tracks for 50 years, then screwing up a budget disc which at least offered some rare material. 2 stars for Buddy only, 0 for Sony."
5,Versitle Ice bucket,I bought four ice buckets for our B&B at least two years ago. They held up well and can be used to ice champagne.
1,disappointed,"This ice bucket was not cheap - but it LOOKS like it should have been! I am planning to give this as a gift, and I'm somewhat embarrassed to do so."
5,Great price/utility ratio!,"We often want more ice when in couch potato mode in front of the TV. This bucket keeps lots of ice so we don't have to miss anything when we freshen our drinks. Easy to clean, too."
5,Ice Bucket,This ice bucket is just the right size and keeps the ice cubes a very long time. I also like the possibility of taking the handle off. I really like it.
4,Tite,"We like the size, clear, light, it work well.Here are your Eleven more words and how I need five more words"
4,good quality,this was a gift and my friends loves it. the quality is good so there's no sense in paying more.
4,fun!,"Old, yes. There is a scene indeed where a Northern ocean is shown, and it is supposed to have brought Lewis ""joy"" though made me think of crayons. No matter, it is wonderful! Buy it, watch it, love it! And for heavens' sake, DO endure the background!"
5,Multipurpose Tray.,"Not only the rectangular tray, but also the tumblers are multipurpose. Helped me get everything organized in my bathroom. I'm a fiestanatic."
1,I don't like em,"I use a QPS Que (that I must say is a piece of junk) and have found that when I burn audio on Memorex products they will not play in any of my CD players except the DVD in my Mac. I never had any problem with Fuji's so I'm switching back, if I can find them."
1,BE VERY CAREFUL,I bought a package of these and my burner couldn't burn any of these. I think these only work for certain types of burners I had a philips magnavox burner
4,FUNNY!,The British duo Flanders and Swann recorded on their two trips to the US in the late 60s and early 70s (?) amaze and enchant with charming and witty music hall songs. Great for kids because of the animals in the songs and even better for adults. Literate humor that doesn't look down on its subjects. Priceless.
1,Disappointing,"As a member of the medical community, I was disappointed w/ Dr. Barnard's book, and impressed w/ his ability to fluff over any views that oppose his. I believe the Eades' point of view received all of two sentences from him, whereas the Eades devote no less than an entire chapter to Dr. Barnard's beliefs. I was a strict vegetarian for 13 years, balooned to well over 300 lbs, and ruined my insulin receptors. I followed the Eades' plan (fat intake and all), dropped 70 lbs in 6 months and have kept it off for 3 years. There are just too many factors that need to be fit into the equasion individually to think one fix will do for everyone. Perhaps Dr. Barnard should broaded his outlook and open his mind."
4,Disturbing story,"Like several other reviewers, I could not put this book down. I was horrified, but kept reading because I wanted to see her prevail. The ending wasn't quite as satisfying as I had hoped; it left me with many unanswered questions.The tale of twisted abuse is quite disturbing. In addition to the medical abuse, Julie, her brother, and the foster children were physically, verbally, and psychologically abused. Julie's mother also neglected to care for veterans she housed (to get the money).Julie's mother and father were also abused in childhood. Hopefully Julie will end this cycle."
