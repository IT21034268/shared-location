5,Great basic intro,"I found this a great basic intro for people like me - just wanting to learn some tap moves as an exercise alternative. In my case, I am also trying to get up to speed so I can participate in a tap group which I just joined at my local senior center.Bonnie explains the basic steps very well, and has some practice drills.Then there are several routines, ordered in increasing difficulty, for you to learn. The routines are really cute and fun, and she breaks things down nicely. If you aren't a beginner, you will probably still get your money's worth just for the routines."
5,Truly for Beginners,This is one of the few tapes I have ordered on various activities that says it is for beginners and actually is. I Love it!!
5,good refresher,"I took tap lessons for 3 years as a child---haven't tap-danced in twenty years, but it all came back on the first viewing of this video. Would be good for absolute beginners. Franklin is a good teacher and has good technique (despite her somewhat dated suspender outfit a la Mork and Mindy..) It's great if you want to learn to tap-dance, but in terms of aerobic exercise it's not vigorous and doesn't really get your heart rate up like a regular cardio workout. Music is good---altogether an enjoyable (and restful) change of pace on my days off from Jane Fonda"
5,Wow! Simply The Best!,"This is simply the best! After trying several different tapes (even one for kids) I had almost decided to give up, but I needed some dance to add to my resume - then I saw ""I hate to excercise - I love to tap!"" Well, that REALLY sounded like me so I decided to try just ONE more tape. Wow! Right off the bat it was the easiest to follow and a whole lot of fun! Not only was I doing steps I could never imagine myself doing before, but I remembered these routines from lots of different musicals and felt like I was dancing right along! Wow! If you've become frustrated and think you will never come close to being a dancer - don't give up! Try this tape and you too will feel like a pro in no time! Congratulations to Bonnie on being such an excellent teacher and, like everyone else I'd like to know when the next tape is coming!"
5,"I Hate to Exercise, I Love to Tap","This is a delightful, easy to follow, instructional video featuring three routines. Bonnie takes you through some beginning steps and builds so you learn a waltz clog routine, soft shoe routine and time-step routine. She gives you all the tools you need to learn. The tape is geared to take you through each routine at a comfortable pace with enough repititions to remember and suggests you rewind and review so you can learn at your own pace. Good, solid traditional routines -- not too difficult."
5,Learn at your own speed...awesome!,"Sometimes it takes awhile to get the move in front of you...into your head and out to your feet. It takes practice over and over. Unlike the studio with people waiting for you to ""get it""...this is on your own...at your own speed. Wherever you are in the tape...you'll get a work out!"
5,Better than a tap class,"This video may be a little dated, but it's still very good. Bonnie goes through the steps at a pace that's easy to understand. She does a quick warm-up, reviews basic steps, then moves on to combinations. I like to put in her video and do just what I want. I can rewind when I need to review a combination and practice. I like that I can learn at my own pace, on my own time."
3,good for the basics,very basic but good for beginners. If you know anything try a class for 20 bucks.(bring your video camera!) that says it all
3,Good Price,If I had it to do over again I wouldn't buy these wires. They work but wires for a Porsche 911 need to be a little thicker for maximum performance. These wires are thin and flimsy. It's best to spent a little more money and not have to worry about whether your wires will sink or swim.
3,Huge!,I was hoping since somebody said they were easy to swallow that they would be smaller than other fish oil softgels. Nope-just as big and hard to swallow. But I'm sure they are beneficial so I will continue to take them. :)
2,Too short,"I love the flexible arms. However, the height was too short, so I returned them. I have similar stakes that are two feet and four feet tall plus the flexible arms. I wish I could find more of these."
4,good for propping up shorter plants,"These stakes are good for propping up shorter plants, like mums, orannuals that are getting too spindly. Wish they sold tall ones, too."
1,Did a ten year old right this?!,"I did not enjoy this book at ALL! It was as though a kid had come up with the story line --not an adult. It kind of made my head hurt, trying to keep up with all of the different subjects, people, etc, that changed throughout the chapters. The ending was just.... I don't even know. I'm ready to say ""Bye Bye"" to this book."
1,dreadful,"After finishing this book, I had to read the reviews to figure out what the heck this was supposed to be and that's never a good thing. There is no character development to speak of and the plot of the story is ridiculous (not good ridiculous, bad ridiculous). The unlikeable main characters' habit of constantly referencing being a Christian was odd and annoying. As a spoof of Christians, the book suffers from a really bad plot and not being particularly funny. (If it's not supposed to be a spoof, then it's even worse. I'm still not even sure about that...) I have to second another reviewer's use of the word ""trainwreck"" to describe it."
2,just too silly,"I know this is supposed to be tongue in cheek but mine is cramping. If the boring stupidity of thekidnappings doesn't stop you, surely the insincerity of the fast will. Christian literature? Not."
1,TRAINWRECK!!!!!!,"what a horror show, if I read one more time that the main character was a Christian and had bad breath I thought I would lose my mind. Seriously, you can write a Christianity based novel without mentioning 12 times a page that you are Christian. We get it trust me. I had to finish it thought to see if the story eventually made sense. It didn't. Lame,just lame. Sorry padre."
5,The Perfect Introduction to M-Commerce&#65533;,"The timely publication of Mr. Louis's book enabled me to quickly comprehend the background and concepts of M-Commerce. Both Service providers and customers who are looking to understand what they are probably already providing & using will benefit from the clear and concise style & content. As a principle-consultant with over 30 years experience in the wireline & wireless telecom industry, I support the insight, analysis & views described in this book. Luckily, I had not been influenced by the negative review, which seems unfounded after reading the book. P.J.Louis provided exactly what I was looking for."
3,Nice cover.,"Nice cover and an acceptable content. However, the data and the layout could be more detailed and better designed. The large book format is also a disadvantage when you look for a reference to use on a day-to-day basis. The most commonly used weapons are listed, but interesting details are missing and a more extensive list of weapons is desirable. Ok reference to start with, if you have no or limited knowledge within the area."
2,Many inaccuracies,I just got this book to fill an order for a gift card I have had for over a year. I have just flipped through a few pages and have noticed many inaccuracies mostly with pictures and their captions. As an example on page 262 the article on Chinese type 56 shows some girls that are each obviously holding a SKS and the captions says they are type 56 carbines. This is just one of many I have noticed and I have just flipped a few pages.
4,A Nice Collection of Mod Rock,"I spotted this two disc set at a local store and decided to take a chance on it. If you like The Jam, mod rock in general, the early Who or even punk, circa 1977, then this is for you. I found a few new favorites here, like the Amber Squad track. Honestly, there are many strong tracks. Recommended...Thought I'd add to my review to say that this collection is now available as part of a 3 CD set called ""Mod Box"". You get these two discs plus one more at a greatly reduced price! (...)"
1,Disappointing,"Perhaps mine is defective because my experience was that it makes no difference. I tried this based on the reviews--figured if it can control litter box odor, it must be great. I hoped it might help with smoke odor from a frequent guest. Normally he goes outside but in bad weather uses the garage. Even though he opens the outside door the smell lingers. Not a big deal but this sounded so good I thought it would help. Wrong. Perhaps the larger one which can be put in a more central spot & uses 3 filters would work better. Putting it in a wall outlet limits how much air it can pull in--directions state it works for a 6 foot area.In the interest of a more accurate review, I also tried it in our kitchen. Didn't make a dent in cooking odors. Then tried it in our very small half bath. Same result. Wish I hadn't bought the extra filters.Also, the first day or so the fan was very quiet but has become increasingly louder, enough so that we can hear it two rooms away."
3,Worked... for a couple of days,"I bought this for my bathroom, where my cats' litterbox also lives. I was shocked when I plugged it in. For the first 48 hours, it was amazing how much of a difference it made in the smell.However, after about that long, it seems to have stopped working almost completely. This was disappointing, after such a promising start. I'm hoping a new filter may do a better job, but so far I'm not terribly impressed."
1,Doesn't seem to make a difference,I share an office in my home with my husband who is a smoker. I notice no change in the smell of cigarettes.
2,Doesn't seem to work,"I bought this based on the amazon reviews, looked like a godsend for my one bedroom + 1 cat. I put in the area right next to my litter box, no effect what so ever. I am not even sure what the point of it is other than blowing the dirty litter air towards another area of the room, which is pretty useless. Very dissapointed since I bought it plus 4 filters."
3,Not quite as good as I hoped,"I was hoping that this fan would clear smelly air quickly. It takes almost as long as a regular fan would to just move the air around. I will continue to use it, but it is not as good as it is presented, as far as I'm concerned."
3,Not sure,"This product is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. It is nice and quiet though, however, I am not sure if it is working. I don't really smell anything coming out of it and I don't really notice any big difference in the air? I am kind of up in the air about this. If anything changes, I will re-post."
2,disappointed,"I bought this for the bathroom in my office, which does not have an exhaust fan, hoping that it would help with typical bathroom odors. It makes little if any difference. It might work on kitchen or trash odors, but I would not recommend it for bathrooms."
3,QUESTION,"I have a quick inquiry. Does the device neutralize the odors or does the device produce an odor that eliminates other bad odors? I do not like the sweet odors of the Febreeze, etc. I would like to try it, but only if it does not produce a sweet noxious odor. And, by the way, after reading most of these posts, I am horrified at the poor grammar and lack of a command of the English language. WOW, it's really bad. Read a book people, take an English class. Shocking.Dr. B."
1,Not worth it...,"I didn't notice a difference. Just ended up using a Glade Plug-In. Cheaper, less cumbersome and doesn't make a fan noise."
1,I ordered the Febreze Odor Removal appliance and I received a Hamilton Beach odor eliminator. NOT happy at all. I thought I was,"I ordered a Febreze Odor eliminator but I received a Hamilton Beach odor eliminator. NOT happy at all. I thought I was I was going to receive something that smelled great LIKE Febreze. Bad move, don't buy one, Cathy"
5,Eliminates pet odors entirely!,I bought this to plug in by my chinchilla cage and sure enough within an hour all odors from the cage were gone. I would definitely recommend this product for any pet owner.
5,Fantastic Odor Control,"WE have an older cat with digestive issues--the litter box is in a small area, the odor could kill you. This appliance is miraculous--of course, there is still a smell when the poo is fresh, but you won't gag--and after cleaning the litter box, the odor is GONE is a few minutes. No perfumes, just gone."
1,Not so helpful,"I purchased 2 - one for each bathroom - and the first day or two it worked great! But from that point forward, I can't tell the difference if I have them on or off. One is for a cat litter box area and the other is for a general bathroom. Disappointing..."
5,Works great!,"Bought two to help control kitty litter odor; one for the bedroom off the kitty letter room and one for the kitty litter room. Found out it also works great for kitchen odors too! Put the one from the bedroom in the kitchen as the one in the kitty litter room worked so well, we did not need the one in the bedroom! Love it!"
5,I'm In Love With My Stinky Litter Box,There really isn't much to say about this product. I plugged it in right next to my litter box and I'm so happy I read a review about this product for my Scoop Free automatic litter box. It works like a dream. The air filter that is. The litter box too. :-) Absolutely no oder at all. I suppose you will be able to leave it off when you first change your litter box (if that is what you are using it for and I can't think of anything more offensive than that) and then turn it on with the odors arrive. Believe me it works like a dream and can last 90 days. I already bought the refills. Me and kitty are all set for the duration. I'm a happy odor-free cat owner.
2,A Very Poor Sequel!!!,"Ok do not get me wrong the try of doing something like this was in good heart but come on DISNEY COMPANY! YOU RUSHED ANOTHER SEQUEL FOR A QUICK BUCK! The story is very poor! I like this Jane's Voice better than Minnie Driver, her voice is not that annoying. NO MUSIC WHAT SO EVER IN THIS FILM! Only a snip of Two worlds with Mandy More for the Main Title and than a dork Finale song and than the End Title that is it! They took once again 3 stories and made it into a second movie! VERY CRAPY ANIMATION! My 3 year old niece could have drawn better! O, I am sorry, Disney is losing it's touch of magic! I bought this on DVD because I thought at least the extras would have been good but they are even worse! Mandy Moore is in there for a snip and that is it! The sneak peeks were the best from this DVD! Sorry Disney you get a very poor from me and I am very great big Disney Fan!"
2,Dissapointing,Well this movie is a total cheat!! Disney took 20 minute stories that they play on television and linked them together for a quick and easy movie. My kids had already seen most of the stories on the Tazan cartoon.If you don't get the daily cartoon then you may not mind paying for it but since we had already seen them all I thought it wasn't worth the money.
2,Disappointing,"My kids (3 and 2) loved Tarzan. Great plot, great music, great animation. When they saw the new Tarzan and Jane, they were bored by it. It lacks everything Tarzan has. This is an example of Disney trying to make some quick cash on an original big hit."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. . . .","Pass on this silly sequel! Stories are nonsense, returning characters are nothing like the original movie version, and Tarzan comes across as supremely stupid. I loved the first Tarzan cartoon from Disney, but the makers of this film seem totally lost and unable to find even a smidgen of the charm or adventure found in the original movie."
1,Horrible Waste of Time!,"Don't waste your money! This movie is as horrible as any straight to video sequel I have ever seen. Paper thin characters, stories taken directly from the cartoon, and cheap looking animation ruin what could have been a promising DVD. Disney is again going for a profit with minimal quality and effort. Stick with the original all the way."
1,The worst movie ever made.,"The title says it all. The first Tarzan movie was a work of art, however, this is a disgrace. They could have actually made an interesting plot with this, except they just threw it all away, adding in weird flashbacks and stuff, probably to direct you away from the lame plot. My eight-year-old cousin fell asleep in this, so I'm sure that I'm not the only one thinking the way I do. As far as Disney sequels that were only realeased on DVD and video go, I'd say the only one worth getting is The Lion King 1 1/2. That one was actually funny and had a plot.I hope this review helped you save your well-earned money."
1,a total disappointment from Disney,"As someone who really enjoyed the first Tarzan, I was really looking forward to the sequel. Boy was I wrong. The animation is choppy and hard to watch, totally unlike the smooth ""deep canvas"" brilliance of the first. There are crazy shadows all over everything so it looks like it's taking place in an aquarium or something. The voices are stiff, the stories are ridiculously bad, and the whole thing comes across as a clumsy rushed effort to make money. I expect better and will absolutely not be buying this foolish thing."
1,No wonder my Disney stock is in the tank,"This is some of the poorest animation I've ever seen from Disney. Bad story, bad voices....bad movie.What's with the shadows? They're on everythnig."
2,"Well, it was O.K., But not the same old Tarzan...","Well, I saw the first movie and I loved it! One of my favorite movies ever! So when this movie came out, Tarzan & Jane, I thought of renting it, so I did. I was so disapointed! I turned the movie off about 5 minutes into the movie. Very poor animation, like cartoon animation. Their voices are way off coarse (exept Tantor's) and Jane is not as charming as she was in the first movie. This movie was okay...It's just...not the good 'ol Disney I expected. How could you, Disney?! >:((P.S. The shadows of the leaves on evey character was really annoying) ;)"
2,Poor quality,Disc looks great but the quality of the video is poor. Looks like it is fake or low budget. Kids don't notice but drives us parents crazy to watch it. Images run together.
3,Its nothing like the Disney Tarzan movie,"It's just for kids. If you are looking for a continuation of the Tarzan movie you may not like this. We bought the original Disney Tarzan animated movie for our kids. The original is great. What this is is three cartoon episodes from the Disney Tarzan television program. The action animation is not nearly as good as in the movie (e.g., the physics of the swinging through the jungle is poor). The plots are terrible/slow/painful. For example, Jane's ditzy girl friends come from London and get chased all day by panthers that never get around to eating them, despite endless chances. It also contains much more gratutious violence. Having said all that, my four year-old seems to like it as well as well as she did the full length animation; thus the third star."
1,What Were They THinking?,"TARZAN AND JANE - is a movie that sorely needed viable story. It was obviously intended for very young kids. There is nothing for the adults in this movie. Even the voice characterizations are week and seemed to be forced in comparison to the original. None of the original actors came back to do their voice - and I know why now that I have seen it. It has three very week stories written in the Narrative format. Meaning, these are past adventures told by the animal characters like - ""Remember when Tarzan did this?"" and ""Remember when Jane did this?"" Extremely week and cheap plot devices.Don't get me wrong, Return To Neverland (the sequel to Peter Pan), Alladins' two sequels and even Pocahantas' sequel were. All were direct-to-video, but still entertaining for the young and old alike.Stay away from this one. Even the DVD extras are not that interesting. What were they thinking? Didn't anyone read the script? And Michael Eisner approved this? Yikes! (12-9-02)"
1,Amazing lack of quality,"My daughter loved the first Tarzan. So we decided to buy the second one without checking any review about it. What a mistake ! The drawing is awful and the story, or may I say the stories (there are three of them) are without interest. I would have expected a better scenario (one could imagine so many interesting ""complete"" adventures on the subjet) and a better quality of the drawing from the disney studio.Too bad."
1,don't waste yer money,"This is nothing more than Disney's attempt to capitalize on the success of it's excellent Tarzan movie. The artwork is very beneath Disney standards, even for a make-a-quick-buck movie (like ""Return of Jafar""). Too flat with a flimsy attempt at depth using very distracting shadows. Oak leaves in a jungle?? The storyline is so-so... 3 episodes of ""remember what happened when...?"" Actor's voices, except for Tantor and Prof. Porter, sound nowhere near the original's. This obviously low-budget (spare time?) project doesn't begin to approach the quality Disney is capable of producing. I don't even recommend renting it."
2,Boring,"My title says it all. I sat waiting for this movie to end as I watched the poor animation and predictable story. The whole movie focused around Jane's flashbacks of the past year she spent with Tarzan. Because they're flashbacks, you already know who's going to live and who's going to...well, live. Nothing too exciting, heartbreaking, wonderful, or anything that falls into that catergory ever happens in this movie. Overall, I would say this movie is an extremely poor follow-up to a great, action-packed, colorfully animated movie. Oh, and if you still have some desire to watch this movie, I wish I knew how to give you ours, because its only use in our house is collecting dust...which isn't that useful. It has only been watched once, so after some feather dusting, it should be in mint condition."
2,Lame,"Tarzan & Jane is one hour and fifteen minutes long and was released direct to video on July 23, 2002. This is the follow-up movie to Tarzan and a rather poor follow-up. Basically the movie is a cut and paste job. The movie deals with Jane trying to figure out what to give Tarzan to celebrate their one year anniversary of marriage together. She talks with Terkina and Tantor, later on her father joins in on the discussion, and they all recall flashbacks on how things went wrong. The flashbacks are episodes taken from the television show The Legend of Tarzan. The three episodes are: ""Tarzan and the British Invasion"", ""Tarzan and the Volcanic Diamond Mine"" and ""Tarzan and the Flying Ace"". In the end Tarzan turns the tables on Jane by giving her a diamond wedding ring, a surprise party, and wearing his father's suit. The story is just a bunch of flashbacks with no real story line to it. Even the original actors did not return to do the sequel. Tarzan & Jane gets a D as in dud."
1,"Wha, wha, wha?","The first Tarzan was the only good one. How could Jim Cummings and Jeff Benett betray me? Tarzan 2 was no exception. I can't believe I had mom waste money on the DVD! This movie (I dare not to call it a movie) is only good for first viewing. Really the only part I liked was the end. Mandy Moore's ""The Song of Life"" was cute. But otherwise, a very dumb movie."
1,Poor Writing and Quality reduces Tarzan to a Sitcom,"While the original film boasted state-of-the-art graphics, wonderfully lush imagery, a beautifully tragic story, and classic music, this direct-to-video sequel will rank among the worst Disney has produced in the last few years. Told like Cinderella II as a trio of shorts, the story revolves around Jane reflecting on her one-year anniversary with Tarzan."
2,Almost a complete waste of money...,"Granted, the stories were cute, BUT... since my 2 boys (5 & 4) had already seen them from the cartoon show, we were very disappointed in this DVD. I can't recommend this DVD unless your kids haven't seen the Tarzan cartoon show, as all 3 of the mini-stories in this movie were taken from that. Also, the artwork is NOT Disney quality, it's very low budget artwork/animation. Also, the voices are horrible. I think the only original voice is Tantor's (the elephant). What a waste. I'll be sure to check online reviews before I ever buy another (over-priced) Disney movie. :o("
5,The only critic I trust...,"The one absolutely essential charasteristic of a reliable movie critic is that they share one's own impeccable taste.After looking for years and disagreeing with Ebert on almost everything (he nearly always gives one star more than a movie deserves and almost never warns you that the movie is a real turkey you should not waste your money on), I finally found JB and lived happily ever after."
1,Very Poor Quality reproduction,"This is a very poor production. Several pages are obscured or completely unreadable due to blurred letters, including pp. 6, 20, 22, 34, 56, 152, 274, 320, 338, 376, 400, 408, 430, 438, 452, 456, 458, 476, 478, 480 and 488; while on pp. 508-553 the inner right hand columns of the text are obscured. The following pages are completely missing: pp. 220, 376, 388, 389, 390, 391, 544 and 556. Many other pages, such as pp. 333-337, consist of poor quality images that are dark, which makes the notes difficult to read. I suggest you say away from this inferior product."
5,Goregous Wallscroll!,"This wallscroll is beautiful! I did sadly crack it in some places because the plastic parts are so easy to break, so be careful handling it. but it came in perfect condition^^! such fast service!!"
4,My baby likes this CD,"The songs are a little slower than the original recordings...not bad for a xylophone version however, I struggle to sing along. My husband didn't recognize some of the songs right away. It's better than other baby music. My little guy likes it, he's 6 weeks old, which is what really matters. We found ourselves in the car when he started screaming and stopped when we started playing the CD. I'm sure he'll hear the original versions when he gets older..."
1,Pretentious and Overreaching,"Parker strains to find a voice that will have an effect and comes up only with his own ""precious"" affectations. An extremely disappointing second effort. Take a pass."
4,"So Many Questions to Pose, So Little Time!","The poems in this collection are full of questions. These poems ask how a poet can describe the modern world--the domestic, the urban, the gods even--by using the ancient form of poetry.Parker has a strong control of the line and succint phrasing. Such as in ""On the Red Eye"" :Next to me, too cool to be excited,A teenage girl in black and black and platform shoesRewinds a tape, the muted whineA sound I imagine she hears God make.I enjoyed the poems with the males voices, in particular, in this set for their truth, for their reflection of people I feel I know.My favorite poem in this collection is ""TV"" which just so perfectly captures a moment.This is the kind of collection that I feel most anyone could read and enjoy. I highly recommend this for the novice to the advanced poetry reader."
4,Better then i expected,This album starts out very well with the first 6 tracks wich are all very good and some of the best songs from snoop since doggystyle. However after that the album starts to sound alot like other no limit albums which is not a good thing. The only track worth listening to after track 6 is #12. However 7 great tracks are good enough for a 4 star rating.
3,Snoop is slowly returning.,"Positives: I love Snoop (Doggy) Dogg. I have ever since Doggystyle. This album has only a few really good tracks, the majority produced by Dre. Snoop's music is returning from its worst period and it hasn't fully recovered from the first No Limit album. He does show however, with tracks like ""Buck Em"" featuring Sticky Fingers (Onyx) and ""B Please"" featuring Xzibit that he can be great again. Next album could use more Xzibit features and Dre production. Good tracks on this album get 5 stars.Negatives: It can't be called gangsta-rap for most of the album. It's just too soft. Tracks 3,7,10,11,13,19,& 21 sound more like something off an R Kelly reject album. What is ""Snoopafella""? Other than bad I ask. ""Down 4 My N's"" with Magic & C-Murder features the patented ""No Limit Never-ending Chorus"". Not Snoop's best attempt but this album shows potential."
5,Snoop is one of the best!,"Snoops albim no limit top dogg is probably one of the best albums i own.Im very selective with my rap artists and really only like a few-Snoop Dogg,Dr.Dre,Ice Cube,2-Pac and Eminem.And I do own the best album of all time Dre's 2001 and topp dogg no limit comes very close to this.2001 would get a 5,no limit would get 4.9."
4,Stay in Cali wit dre and them,"I think snoop returned to his roots and most of the songs on Top Dog are tight.He needs to work with dr Dre Dj Quik, and Meech Wells as far as his beats go.He should work with the dog pound Nate dog and warren g because thats when hes at his best.When he works with anyone from No Limit besides silk the shocker he sounds rediculous and those no limit beats dont fit him at all. Keep it real snopp D_O_G_G take back to cali wit dre and them."
3,get the blue disc first,The blue disc was better in many ways but dogg was just getting into No Limit so he wasn't sure about his rapping
1,You've got to be kidding me,"Ever since Death Row dispersed, Snoop Dogg has been in limbo. Almost like a free agent, Snoop is picked up by No Limit, and makes a much anticipated album that didn't meet up to people's expectations. He then follows it up with this release, hoping that Dr. Dre and other producers could spice up his ailing style. It doesn't work. Most tracks, his voice isn't even loud enough to understand, and it sounds like his lyrics are an afterthought to the music. You should have stayed with your old style, Snoop. Doggy Style is still a classic in my book, but the rest are all going to the Pawn Shop. Better luck next time. This CD is not worth buying."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"Top Dogg is, at best, a tradgedy. I bought the album a few years ago, shortly after its release, and have only been able to bear listening to it about three times - each time entering with a clean mind, hoping to be impressed, only to find myself extroidinarily dissapointed. Top Dogg doesn't touch Doggystyle, nor does it even deserve the recognition Snoop has earned as a featured artist on numerous recordings by Dre. Pac, and others. Unfortunately, much of Snoop's recent solo works have been terrible. Top Dogg is no exception, it is rather a prime example."
1,The [$$$] I Will Never Get Back,"Everyone told me how good this CD was.So I decided to buy it.Turns out every song on this CD,except for track 5,is worth skipping.I am trying to sell it and get my money back.But they won't buy it because they know how terrible it is.Seriously,track 5 is the only one worth listening to.It ain't a song,it is some crazy man talking,but it is hilarious.Trust me,don't make the same mistake that I made,save your money."
4,The Top Dogg is BACK,"This cd is 4 times better than his first No Limit cd It goes back to the real Snoop. I think its great I bought it this morning and it hasn't left my cd player yet,Snoop is the force to be reckoned with on this cd. He is Raps Top Dogg West Coast East Coast Dirty South it don't matter hes got the skills. All the songs are good the skits are funny. Its the full circle LP I dig it I love the whole thing."
2,Don't know why every liked it,I'm sorry but I don't understand why every one likes this album I don't like that many songs on it. I really like # 15 and I sorda like #5 but some are really wack like 21 he is trying way to hard sorry
3,"I am still undecided, I got Mr. Servon and I listened to tha",Well I think that Snoop should have stayed at Death Row but I do understand that it was a family move. With Silkk being his nephew he really didn't have a choice with Death Row goin broke. I am still undecided about the Cd though. I have found that Mr. Servon is tight though.
3,I THOUGHT IT WAS RAW. SNOOP REALLY DOES'NT RAP GOOD.,"HE SHOUJD HAVE STAYED ON THE WEST COAST WITH SUGE KNIGHT, BECAUSE SUGE TOOK CARE OF HIM. ALL NO LIMIT WANT IS TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF HIM BECAUSE OF WHO HE IS."
5,"Easily his second best CD after ""Doggystlye""","Much better than his other wack No Limit CD. This brings that funky westcoast G stlye ish that Snoop sounds the best on. Thank the good lord above that Snoop teamed back up with Dre and DJ Quik for the beats on this album besides that horrible Beats by the Pound crew (Except KLC of course). When you first hear the loooooooooow base of ""Buck Em"" you know you're gonna hear some hot ish. Other standout cuts include: ""Trust Me"", ""My Heat goes Boom""(Which sounds alot like ""Still a G Thang"" from his last album), ""G Bedtime Stories"", ""B Please"", ""Betta Days"", ""Doin' Too Much"", ""Party with a DPG"", ""Just Dippin'"", ""Don't Tell"", and ""20 Minutes"". BUY IT DAMMIT!!!!!!!"
3,"PLEASE DON'T SAY YOU'VE FINALLY FALLEN OFF, SNOOP","Until this release all signs indicated Snoop was maturing...TopDogg is tired and it seems as though he has nothing to say, and I know this isn't true. Where are Daz, Kurupt, Nate, Mystikal, Fiend...? Charlie Wilson...? RBX???"
3,best he will put out with no-limit,When doggystyle came out everybody had to have a copy. I know people that didn't even listen to hip hop that had the album. Well it is not likely to happen again but snoop can try. There are a couple of stand out tracks but overall the album is average. I am still waiting for a new album that was like the Chronic or Doggystle to come out. Dr. Dre says that the Chronic 2000(not Suge Knight's version) will be just as good. Can't wait.
1,bullsh**,"i think snoop is going nowhere , doggystyle was the best and always will be snoops best, so if you want some real snoop dogg go get doggystyle not this crap, you will get tired of this in a week, i think its just a waste of money, when there are so many other great albums and artists like mos def ,de la soul,jurassic 5,black eyed peas"
3,Snoop Dogg-No Limit Top Dogg,"No Limit Top Dogg, Snoop's second album on No Limit Records, harkens back to the sound of his Death Row days while keeping a slight No Limit sound edge to it. Although it brings more balance to the album, whereas Da Game is to Be Sold Not to Be Told was No Limit's signature Beats By the Pound soundscape, it surprisingly doesn't always work as well. Standout tracks like ""Bitch Please"" featuring an always on point Xzibit and ""Ghetto Symphony"" featuring a slew of No Limit and DPG affiliated guests show that both sounds can work. The combination is interesting, but the album sputters and staggers it's way to the finish line clocking in at 21 tracks. Bad sequencing and the ever present filler tracks that seem to plague so many hip hop/rap releases over the past ten years or so fatten up what would have been a much better album had the unnecessary tracks been left off the release."
3,A person who liked Snoop when he was in death row,"I have no clue why Snoop Dogg went to No Limit, that's like Freddy Krueger going out with Pamela Lee. YES!! he is too good for No Limit, and besides, he is a west coast rapper, he shouldn't go to a south coast label.The best Label for Snoop to join right now is Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. Of course Death Row Would be better if it didn't have all these current problems like Suge Knight in jail, and 2Pac dead, and Dre gone, Ect...Ect...Ect..."
4,Tha Doggfather is back!!!,"Snoop's new album is the best that he has released in years. This is due mostly to the lack of the beats by the pound production team. Snoop made one of the best decisions of his career to go once again with Dr. Dre and D.J. Quick. The only weak tracks on the album are Ghetto Symphony which features all of the No Limit tank with less than average verses and Down for my N which showcases C-Murder. If you liked Snoop in tha Doggfather days, this is a cd for you!"
4,snoop's still climbing,but he'll never reach the kind of success he had wit doggystyle when he's wit no limit. With Death Row he put down the gangsta sh+t and didn't care what other people thought. He's gotta bring gangsta rap back
3,his best since doggiestyle,this is his best since his debut but that's not saying much cuz the in between albums stunk.but with quik and dre on board it is a step in the right direction hopefully for him not to late.cuz what a waste of a possible brillant career that has setttle for run of the mill material and half-hearted production.
4,Dolomite Rules,"This album had a lot of good songs on it, Down 4 My Niggaz, G Bedtime stories, Ghetto Symphony, Buss'N' Rocks, and 20 Minutes. There was not a bad song on the album, and the Dolomite interlude is the funniest I have heard in a long time"
4,No Limit's finest,"Snoop's second album on No Limit is by far his best efford since ""Doggystyle"". While ""Tha Game Is To Be Sold, Not To Be Told"" contains terrible beats(by the pound), ""Top Dogg"" is touched by skills, such as Dr.Dre, Meech Wells and DJ Quik. Snoops laidback and charismatic flow is perfect for the west coast gangsta funk and makes this album another Cali classic. ""Top Dogg"" starts off with the hardhittin' ""Buck 'Em"" and tells us that the Big Dogg is back. Other memorable tracks is the mad sweet ""Just Dippin'"", ""In Love With A Thug"" and the hit single ""B Please"". Anyway, the dogg shows us yet again who's the biggest of them all.Woof!"
4,SNOOP DOGG IS SAVED BY THE PEOPLE HE FEATURES,"OTHER THAN 3 OR 4 TRACKS THIS CD STINKS. HE GOT SUGA FREE, EX ON THERE AND A SILK-E-FYNE. SNOOP LOST THE TOUCH THAT SENT HIM TO THE TOP. HE DOSEN'T DESERVE TO BE CALLED ""THE TOPP DOGG"" CUZ DMX CLEARLY IS THE ""TOP DAWG"" NOWADAYS"
3,I give up,"Until Snoop goes back to his old style with death row, thats it for me. He does have a few tight songs on tha album, but too many more wack ones."
2,"What This CD Has, and Doesn't Have","To start, Snoop is one of the best rappers. But he doesn't show this on this CD. To me, it seemed he rushed this CD. ""B Please"" is the only ""good"" track. The other songs are only Ok like ""Buck 'em"". The only problem with this CD is the beats. They are not good. But the CD does have good lyrics"
1,a paragraph about how gangster rap has no tallent,"its rappers like this that are a descrace! all the no limit rappers rap about, gangs, sex and violence.what kind of message is that to send out to the public?there rapping style is the same on every song,there lyrics dont flow and they can't rhyme.enyone who listens to no limit must think being a gangster is cool and that is why they listen to it."
1,This album is garbage,"I am sorry but this album really stinks! I loved Snoop on Doggystyle, thought he was alright on Doggfather, was very disapointed with Tha Game... but this one is almost unlistenable. Avoid this album at all costs because it is terrible beyond belief."
3,typical,"I am getting so sick of buying a CD from No Limit and hear everyone but the persons name on the cover. That's typical though with all No Limit crap. When I buy a CD of a certain rapper, I want to hear them and not a conglomeration of everyone from NO Limit. This album does have a few good songs on it, only the ones that have Just Da DoggFather in them. Snoop is once again slammin those funky beats from the old school. But I think he would be better off if he left No Limit and went with Dre and Aftermath Records, cause only Dre can bring out the REAL Snoopfella. Am I the only one that feels this way?....."
5,Goin back to LBC!,This is a tight album. He's goin back to a more old school sound. He seems like he's in it to win this time.
4,interesting concepts...,"this is a light reading for all who wants a little ""refreshment"" for the mind. lots of mental exercises to help you become happier, more efficient, motivated and creative. Of course to achieve the results, one need to practise but this book gives many practical tips and advice."
3,Amusing,"Amusing, a few helpful hints on visualization. The exercises on the web are worth trying but I expected a more comprehensive guide. Very easy reading."
4,Aqua Drops,"Wife had some of these drops and found out that they were very goodfor improving dry mouth.I therefore got a good size lot(120)It wasdismaying to find out that the mfg.has stoped making them. Therfore,thesupply was limited to their stock.(the candy store) Richard Thaxter"
3,"Not a bad version of Hardrock, Coco and Joe","It is probably worthwhile to buy this just for their version of Hardrock, Coco and Joe. The Doo Wop sound does not work well for many Christmas songs."
1,Totally ineffective,"This product is totally ineffective in cleansing your system... i had been hoping to see atleast some detox symptoms - like cleaning up the liver, eliminating waste, and increased energy. Well, it did nothing and was a simple waste of time by taking several pills a day.I urge you to not waste your money of this product. After trying this, I found some benefit of detox by simply eating fruits, drinking plenty of water and exercising."
2,Absolutely dissapointed!!,"After seeing Dr. Brenda Watson on a local PBS program, I felt that her outlook towards improving your internal health by increasing fiber sounded like a splendid idea. I found the First Cleanse system at a Whole Foods store and decided to try it. With great anticipation, I began the program on the Friday morning of a 3-day weekend (I was expecting ""quick"" results and wanted to be close to home just in case). Much to my surprise over the first few days, nothing happened. Two weeks later and not having had a BM in 4 days, I turned to Senekot and was relieved that the following morning I achieved success. I had also increased my fiber intake with the foods recommended in Dr. Watson's program and water as well. I still beleive in the theory but I don't think this product is all it's hyped up to be. I bought some Triphala and will continue my flaxseed regimine but I will search for another cleansing product. I guess you really can't believe everything you see on TV!!"
1,Didnt work,I used this for the full 2 weeks following all of the directions. All it did was make me very gassy. I will not use this again and I would not recommend it.
1,"I received a ""Natural"" NOT ""Organic"" Product.","Unlike the picture and the product information, the ""First Cleanse"" I received was NOT organic, so its ingredients were sullied with the residues of herbicides and pesticides, etc. ""Natural"" is produced by conventional agriculture, not raised organically. Major bummer..."
5,Gets the job done for a low price,"Great product for a great price. I may have to replace the cables in a year or 2, but the cable is worth it for the price."
2,NOT a quality cable,This is fine for someone who just wants a cable to screw around with but if you are serious about sound and sound quality this is NOT for you. The cables emit a ridiculous amount of white noise out of any speaker I used them with.Invest in Mogami or Monster cables if you are serious.
1,Dont listen to the good reviews here,"I have had this cable for about a month now. It has terrible grounding issues with my guitars. I have tested many different cables and guitars in order to isolate this cable as the culprit. Stay away! Spend a dollar more for a better cable, as long as it isn't made by Hosa!Buyer beware!!"
4,love it!,"I'm not an experienced photographer, but this lense (and my Nikon D40) make me feel like I am!! I love this lense. For the money, it's fabulous!! The only thing that drives me crazy, is that it is manually focused exactly opposite from my old (crummy) lense, but I'm adjusting."
1,Doesn't autofocus with some Nikon bodies,"This could be a good lens for the money. Except that it does not autofocus with some Nikon DSLR bodies, such as the Nikon D40X.I didn't see in the ad that it doesn't autofocus with some Nikon DSLRs, nor is this indicated in the information that came with the lens."
2,somewhat dissapointed,"in the advertisment it is shown that this lens will work perfectly with all kinds of nikon digital cameras but when i tried it with my d60 camera the auto focus did not work , so i gave it to a friend to sell it for me , after waiting for long time i was dissapointed ."
2,Faulty lens?,"Left side of all pictures was soft compared to right side, especially the lower left portion. Exchanged for a replacement."
5,Sigma vs Nikon,"The Sigma 18-200 is my second Sigma lens, the first was their 10-20.The Sigma 10-20 out shoots the Nikon 12+ and is less costly.Like most SLR people we want one lens for 80% of our shooting.The Sigma 18-200 lens fits that need.Having a Nikon D200 I looked and looked at the Nikon 18-200, but the price and weight were turn offs.I tested the Sigma 18-200 at a local store and the weight was less than my Nikon 18-70!I'm not into the VR lens, so the Sigma 18-200 DC fit my needs.I'm over 500 shots in the last week and the Sigma 18-200 is excellent.Did I mention the Sigma 18-20 DC from Amazon is ONE THIRD the Nikon 18-200 price. Take the savings and buy the Sigma 10-20 for your SLR."
1,Poor autofocus in low light,"Auto focusing in low light is poor. Also, it may not even auto focus with some Nikon digital DSLR. Buyer beware."
4,nice shoe for the price,"So far I am quite happy about this purchase, like the color and style, quite comfortable too, haven't experienced bad weathers yet, don't know whether whether the water will go through it in the rainy weather.. I am glad I chose half a size smaller than my usual size, thanks to the previous comments:)"
5,"ahhhh, comfort","Ordered yesterday . . . and they are on my feet right now! And I have to say they are the most comfortable shoes I have EVER put on my foot. I am so glad I followed my whim to get them, I mean for less than 20 bucks I figured I'd take the gamble. This time I won!"
5,I love this CD,"I lived in Japan for three years--fifty years ago--and every time I listen to this CD I get homesick. The instruments are western--a harp, a flute, and a viola--but they sound Japanese, and the Japanese vocalist, Hiroko Masaki, has a wonderful way with these songs. The name of the violist, Vladimir Mendelssohn is left out of the credits above, but the three songs in which he has a part are three of the loveliest. I can't think of a better introduction to Japanese traditional songs. Translations are not given but there is a short description of each song."
1,So what is the point of this?,"I really do not understand what people find great about this stuff. I thought I was listening to a Jazz album when I put it on but shortly thereafter, the music disintergrated and digressed into noise consisting of feedback, drill-type sounds and other mumbo-jumbo.You know if any of you saying Britney Spears in no-talent but yet try to hand my this nonsense that THIS is genius or whatever, I must say, I am a total loss to understand your idea of music....even as an art. Now while Britney Spears may not be much in the way of art, she is good entertainment. As for this cd, beyond track one, what am I supposed to do with this?"
3,Took a long time - quality less than expected,"The jacket of the hard cover book was marked with a grease pencil, the of the corners of the book especially show a good deal of wear. The book itself is in good condition. I wouldn't mind so much the look if they would have described it in more detail. The book took so long in arriving that I'd almost forgotten having ordered it."
3,"Some Good, Some...","The title is quite clever, although a little misleading. There isn't a lot of Christmas involved -- of course, with Holmes, there wouldn't be. Some stories are, as usual, better than others. Some are downright bad. A few have the distressing tendency that some Holmes ""fans"" have to glorify, or at least ""redeem"" Watson. Let's face it, true Holmes fans don't read the stories to hear about Watson! Despite a few clinkers, this is a pretty good book -- but I wish it had been available in paperback!"
5,Thin Client Computing Explained,"I have read this book and found it very good. I was actually looking for a book on the CCA Citrix Certifed Administrator Certification but there are no books on this. This book gives you the knowledge on ""how"" to implement Metaframe in the Enterprize. I recommend it highly."
4,"Pretty good book...organized, thorough & clear","The book makes a good reference for those looking to set up & administer Citrix. In addition, for those looking to pass the CCA exam, I would recommend this book as a good starting point."
4,Excellent book on implementing WTS,"This was an excellent book for the first time installer, included many examples and recommendations."
3,Great Book -- Awful Performance by Lolita Davidovich,"Steve Martini's book, The Judge, is one of his best. It has a good plot and interesting characters -- especially The Coconut, a Mexican-American Judge (Brown on the outside, White on the inside). When I read the book, I was so interested in The Coconut that I would keep skipping ahead to see what he would do next. The movie has Edward James Olmos playing The Coconut perfectly and Chris Noth playing Martini's series hero, Paul Madriani. He, too, delivers an excellent performance. With two actors of this caliber, why on earth did they cast Lolita Davidovich as Lenore Goya, an ex D.A. who joins Madriani's team and becomes his love interest. Davidovich is, IMHO, a much overrated actress, and in this mini-series she delivers a wooden performance that is painful to watch. She's bad enough that I'm knocking my rating down from five stars to three."
3,Good as the book?,"I read the book and LOVED IT!!! Does the movie hold up? Generally I dont like to see movies that were once books because usually the movies suck..anyone happen to know???READ THE BOOK- THE JUDGE FIRST if possible, its a page turner"
2,Not as great as some who reviewed say,After reading several glowing reviews of this book. I am disappointed in the actual product. Much adieu about nothing.
1,Simplistic and Error Laden,"With the plethora of suitable tomes on this topic, it is sad to see such a sorry effort in print. The author parrots some of the more familiar arguments favoured by the pop analysts, and attempts to hide the lack of useful instruction by inundating the reader with charts. The charts are given superficial examination, occasionally leading to a proper conclusion but just as often revealing a simplistic or erroneous analysis. This book is a fine guide to accumulating a small fortune, provided, that is, you begin with a large fortune."
1,It Made Me Laugh!,"I'm not the complete expert, but I favor technical analysis over fundamental analysis. This book, however, is so flawed that it would drive the uninitiated away from tech analysis. The errors and the grammar mistakes are inexcusable, particularly in a book priced like this. The author misconstrues most of the conventional knowledge in the field, and attempts some odd pastiche of research to no avail. An avalanche of charts, provided with no meaning or context. The author reminds me of the grade school student, faced with a baffling essay question, who begins flailing with his shovel, hoping to unearth some nugget of meaning. The author here, sadly, did not strike gold."
3,The concept is not explained,The author proposed many patterns and declared their meanings. But he didn't take time to explain or analyse why this is true.
1,"Full of Errors, Poorly Written","The author takes a simplistic look at the subject; he explains nothing that cannot be found in the most basic primer. To compound the problem, the writing style is compromised. The writer has little command of English phraseology, nor apparently did his editor. I wonder if this was perhaps translated (badly) from another language? I also detected several fundamental errors in the treatment of technical analysis. Avoid this one, there are so many other books availalbe from genuine experts who know the subject and write with authority."
1,The Technical Analysis Course,"I ordered this book on July 30. On Aug 12 I was told ""It's in the mail"". On Aug 19 got e-mail order cancelled------no explanation. Not happy cost me 3 weeks."
2,It is only a beginner's course in Technical Analysis,"This book is for those who only want to learn the basic concepts of technical analysis. The types of charts and concepts used in technical analysis were all only briefly described. You will need to learn a lot more about technical analysis than what is in this book if you want to use it to buy and sell stocks successfully. Thus, this book is way overpriced for the information it provides.The quality of the charts in the book is only fair and should have been better organized. Most of the time, the charts are at least two pages away from the text that explains them."
2,Full of Errors and Misconceptions,"I have read many books on the subject, and I'm not sure this author has a grasp of the concepts. It reads as though it was pasted together from magazine articles, and there is very little to tie the disparate thoughts together. The author seems confused, as there are frequent contradictions, more than once in the same chapter. If you are only going to read one book on this subject, pick one where the author has a command of the topic; this one will leave you as befuddled as the author."
1,Badly Organized Jumble of Techniques,"This book was assigned reading for a college-level investing course; now I understand why the professor drives an old car and teaches this class instead of making money in the market. In all my years of schooling, I've never encountered something so poorly assembled. I have unearthed a few useful concepts, but they are largely buried in an pile of tired market cliches and chart after chart of dated 1980s investing patterns.There are many other books on the topic (you can do a search on ""technical analysis"" right on this Amazon site) that are both current and accurate. I keep a lot of my textbooks after finishing a course, I find them to be useful references. This one will go immediately to the used section of the campus bookstore."
3,3 shelf bathroom space saver,"I just received this item which was not nearly worth the shipping charges (shipping cost more than the item.) The space saver is okay, but all of the nuts were missing from the packet of hardware and I will have to buy more to finish assembling...and, unfortunately, I could not use the third shelf because my toilet seat won't go up with the shelf attached."
4,It Works for Me!,"This stand alone shelf unit is sturdy and well worth the money spent. The only thing I had a problem with is the excessive packaging used for shipping it. The outer box had alot of padding between it and the box the unit was actually in. And I'm not so sure it weighed the 30lbs. they state it does (shipping costs go by the pound)! But all in all, if you're looking for some extra storage/decoration space in your bathroom give this one a try!"
3,"Typical K&N filter, only so so...","This is one of many K&N; filters I have purchased. I buy K&N; filter for its reusability rather than its claimed performance boost. All previous K&N; filters I have installed shared a good quality trait, reinforced structure. This one is different! I am wondering if it is made by the same manufacture or faked by an unknown factory in rural China. Not only lacking supporting material on the filter part, this product has an extremely sloppy frame compared to the OEM filter; thus making it harder to install as it flexes too much. After installation, this filter showed little to none increase on either gas mileage or horsepower compared to the 40k-mile-old factory air filter.For me, I am still getting the reusability of the air filter...I hope. At the same time, I am a bit nervous about this product due to its sloppy structure. Is it going to hold up after next clean and renewal process? I am not sure although hoping for the best."
3,Not much of a difference,"The filter promises more horsepower and improved mileage. From my standpoint, in my car, there is no noticable improvement in acceleration, from a performance standpoint, it seems to be the exact same car.As for mileage, I was averaging 25.x MPG before the filter in mixed (highway/city) driving. This has improved to 26.x MPG, so on average, I picked up between 1.0 - 1.5 MPG, so that was nice.The longevity of the filter is appealing and since it will be a while before it needs to be cleaned, I can't comment on the maintaining the filter. I will likely buy a MazdaSpeed 3 before the filter needs to be cleaned."
2,K&N - No measurable gains,"The product fit perfectly and was easy to install in the factory casing. However, for costing almost 4 times as much as a standard paper filter from Fram I would expect to at least think I was getting any performance gains. There is absolutely no gains in gas mileage, and it sure doesn't feel like there are performance gains in acceleration. At least it is re-usable, provided I buy the cleaning oil at around ten dollars a bottle. Come to mention it, when that time comes I will be in about 50 dollars and could have replaced a paper filter five times. . . Value? maybe if you plan on keeping your car for the full million mile warranty the K&N filter comes with. My advice, stick with the paper filters or go with a cold air intake. No sense in hoping this product will benefit you in any manner performance wise."
1,Do Not Buy: Censored Version,"First of all, I love Kathy Griffin and the one star rating is not about the show. My complaint is about the release of a censored version. Although Kathy's humor is not based on profanity, I don't want to pay for a censorved version of her show that I can just as well watch on TV. I'm submitting for a refund."
1,I would give this a -5 if possible,"Kathy Griffin is absolutely disgusting.. she's over 50 years old, menopausal, held together by a hundred plastic surgeries, gyrating all over Anderson Cooper during New Years who is a dignified and respectable gay man, taking her clothes off on Letterman, an old pedo. She pretends to be under 20, talking about Justin Bieber and the teenyboppers as if it is her age and it is hip to do soKathy Griffin's voice is nasally and her laugh is horsey and everything about her screams absolute desperation. Desperate to be famous, desperate for attention. Why is she so popular in America?I cannot wait until she gets so old that collagen and plastic can no longer hold her face together and she won't be mistaken for anything but a wannabe with raging corned beef curtains"
5,LMAO,"Never got to see the first season so was glad I did. Loved it. Laughed how her parents were both wine-o's and hubby Matt was totally right by her side. Really makes you see just how hard Griffin works to make us laugh!! If you're a Griffin fan, grab it for the collection. I have Seasons 1-4 right now and plan to get all seasons."
2,Average Fantasy Fare. Yawn.,"I read The Hall of the Mountain King back in 1988, and I jotted down my impressions of the novel at that time. The male characters in this novel were very effeminate, and I don't think that's what the author intended. Rather, I got the impression that the author just wasn't skilled in showing how males express deep friendships toward each other.The plot concerns a youth who's the scion of a sun god. He comes to accept his inheritance of his grandfather's kingdom, but first he has to defeat his uncle. The boy has mind control powers and is a quick swordsman, so he kicks butt through most of the book. However, halfway through the book we find out he's only 15 years old! Suspension of disbelief is shattered at that point.Save your money. This isn't worth reading."
5,Great Weather Overview,"This is a great book for people mildly interested in weather phenomena all the way to hard core 'weather junkies'. Paul Douglas, who is very popular in the Twin Cities, covers a wide range of weather topics, focusing on extreme weather conditions that grip our attention, like tornadoes and hurricanes, and even addresses politically sensitive issues like global warming. His style is sufficiently scientific to satisfy serious weather buffs, yet the book is an easy read. I learned a lot of details about weather phenomena that actually should help me understand the next extreme weather situation in my area. The photos are spectacular. My kids, who study weather in elementary school, really enjoy the book too. Cool photos."
1,Where's my DVD!!!,"Being a huge fan of Kung Fu when I was young, I was excited to order the DVD and watch the shows. I didn't believe the other reviewer who said the DVD was not available, and I ordered anyway. I placed my order August 4th, and still have not received it....how frickin hard is it to make a DVD copy and ship it??? Whoever is in charge of their sales and marketing should be fired!!"
5,kung fu series yrs 1 thru 3,movies were delivered on time. Excellent quality as was price. I have watched almost all of dvds and they are excellent. I will have no problem with ordering other items that would interest me.
4,my husband loved this,"I bought this for my 61 year old husband who loved kung fu then and loves it now. although the sound and color is the same as it was when it came out, it is great fun to watch and quite nostalgic. As always love the ability to just click and have it purchased and shipped with the one click."
4,"Kung Fu, First Three Seasons","I really enjoy my Kung Fu tv series, however the first disc that is suppose to have the pilot movie is exactly the same as the # 3 disc. How can I get the correct disc 1 ?"
4,kung fu technical problems,"I have not finished all the cd's, just the 1st season, but one of them had gaps and pauses that required me to pause and replay every few minutes."
1,I'm so blue for Nikita!!,"This flik is dreadful!!! To give it even one star is too generous. I hate the actor, Kenny Lee. Has he been in another movie? Of course not, he is talent-less! He spent all those years in school to do this? Say it isn't so! Don't quit your day job. Ooops, you already did!"
5,Great ideas for coastal architecture,This author is one of my favorites for architecture so I was glad to find this older copy for such a great price. His plans are easy to read and the sketched elevations show good details. His designs don't go out of style even though this was published in 2004. I have been having trouble finding coastal design ideas so this was a great find.
5,A must buy for any true music lover,"This is one of the best all around albums I have ever bought! I'm not normally into ""dance"" music, but I like jazz, and this shows a perfect and natural blend of both genres into a very tight mix, smooth flowing sound. I had no idea anyone had thought to incorporate the two sounds together; but upon hearing the first four songs of this album at a music store, I bought it right then and there. The album is solid from start to finish, catchy, but not poppy, and just packed full of a variety of sounds that will have you relaxing with your eyes closed as the music slides over you one minute, and up grooving and dancing the next. It will stick in your head and you won't regret a moment of it! If you don't buy it, you're missing out."
2,Cheesy nonsense,"There is very little originality on this album. Relentlessly copying and abusing old jazz & blues recordings doesn't quite cut it in my view. Why this album gets so much acclaim is beyond me; the samples are almost without exception cheesy and the arrangements boring to the core. There is extremely little musical interest in this album, even considering its purpose (lounging). People who like the sound of old jazz and blues had better buy the original stuff.The only reason I gave this album two stars instead of just one is because of the technical mastery of the producers. They surely know their stuff, but I think they could do much better than this."
1,bad.....,"This album is very bad. It get's one star for the beginning of ""so flute"" and thats about it. I have heard people talk about it as being good acid jazz, but it doesn't deserve that title. I don't know what you would call it (and I don't care either), but all that I know. is that it's a pathetic attempt at creativity."
5,A must-have CD,"This is one of the best CDs I've ever had the chance to listen.Listen to ""So Flute"" and ""Pont des Arts"" on Amazon, and you'll be hooked immediately.Diverse enough for jazz fans, and fairly upbeat and dynamic for electronic music fans.Beware! Never lend you CD! The other person may like it too much, and will never turn it back."
4,St. Germain - Tourist,Excellent music. Goes as background music to a party as well as for active listening. Definitely one of my favourite LPs of all time
5,...dont keep makin the same mistake i made...,"...you know how it goes, you hear a few good things about some cd, but nobody you know owns it, you keep pickin it up...only to tell the cashier at check out that you aint gonna get it right now...so you buy only the stuff you are sure about! (but your decision not to get it keeps naggin at you...naggin at you....)dont lie yall; yall know yall did that too...well, i finally broke down and got this and this is more gorgeous than i ever thought it would be...my only regrets are buyin the cd's i picked over this...the blend of jazz and electronica is damn near perfect, i cant believe this hasnt made it's way to more main stream outlets. i dont know anything about moby, but i love dj cam's 'mad blunted jazz', tosca's 'suzuki', anything duke ellington, john coltrane or miles davis and isaac hayes...i have about five hundred cd's now and this is one of my top twenty!! get this yall...it's worth it!"
4,this album starts out on one vibe...,...then it kinda gets too housey. it's all good. it's variety. it's just a little eclectic. overall likeable
3,Rose Rouge...,"is my absolute favorite! It's why I bought the cd. I wasn't particularly crazy about a few of the tracks on the cd; however, after listening to in its entirety, I found myself enjoying more. So my advice to those that are considering TOURIST, listen first, and you might actually find yourself with a gem. ~Enjoy!"
5,Musical Epiphany,"Without question, this is the best CD I've heard in a very long time. It's a near-perfect blend of sounds - jazz, dub, techno, blues, lounge, funk and latin flavor. Navarre has created a sensational stew here. It's a savory feast for the senses. If you close your eyes, you can hear a sax off in the distance, a flute floating in and around you. You can hear John Lee Hooker whispering some blues riff to you as the lights of the club pierce your soul, taking you on a wonderful trip down the rabbit hole.Each track offers something new.. Cough up your cash and sample this wonderful collage of sounds. I promise you'll love it.."
3,Not Deep House,"For those who are attracted to this dic from the deep soulful house of Boulevard or From Detroit to... beware, this is light loungy faux jazz. It's alright, but it is not serious deep house which I've credited St. Germain with in the past. So Flute is the stand out track."
5,Great music,"just buy it, you wont regret it.. this is one of those cd you can put anywhere, anytime, and you'll just enjoy"
3,3.5 stars - Jazz coming full circle?,"Although I have owned this album for months, I'm still not sure what category I should file it under. The elements of electronica and jazz are equally and sumlimely blended on ""Tourist,"" and to force it into one category or the other would cut out half of the potential audience. Many of the solos on this album are exciting, as ""Tourist"" contains several talented jazz musicians, but you often get the feeling that the tracks are finished as soon as they've started, for there is rarely any change in the beats, chords, rhythms, or dynamics once a song has begun. After 30 or 40 minutes, this can lend a droning, boring flavor to the album. However, this fusion of electronic beats with live jazz makes for an exciting combination. Jazz hasn't been made sheerly as dance music (at least not creatively) since the early 40s. After a long hiatus, jazz could be coming full circle back to its hip-shaking hot feel."
4,Rose Rouge Does It For Me,"I especially like the first number, Rose Rouge, but the rest of the CD is enjoyable as well. Also available in an edition with a 2nd CD containing additional mixes."
5,All time best Driving album,"This album never gets old -- I have driven thousands of miles and km with it on -- driving at night, in the day, it's deep, grooving, not harsh. Fantastic"
5,"Third time buying, probably not the last!","This is one of my favorite cd's. The reason I have bought it so many times is because once my get scratched from playing it over and over, I will continually buy this cd. The colaboration of songs and the different types of sound makes this cd a must for instrumental."
5,"simple, lightweight, and reliable","i bought this item mainly for storing music. i was a bit sceptical at first given the size, i was afraid it may become too hot after using it for hours on end; thankfully my worries were not justified. i can keep it hooked up to my computer and run programs all day and it stays cool to the touch. also i have just under 20,000 songs stored on my lacie as well as some of my other files and still have 1/3 of the drive space available. lightweight, easy to use - i am very happy with this product."
4,160 GB LaCie Mobile Drive,"This portable USB hard drive has met my expectations. I did not find the included back up software to be user friendly. I am using Windows backup utility instead. I am also using this drive to store music and other information to reduce the amount of data on my computers hard drive.No problems so far, just plug and play. It is powered by the USB port."
5,absolutely brilliant,all i can say about these books(the entire David Eddings series of books) is that they can be read and re-read any number of times and you will still feel as if you are reading it for the first time. You get caught up in the lives of the characters and once the book is opened you feel as if even the call of supper isn't enough to make you put the book down.
5,"Beware Bad Fantasy, Here comes the Knight of Fantasy","After Reading the Belgariath and the Malorean 10 times I still am amazed by Eddings writing style and abillity to evolve the lives of Garion, Polgara, Belgarath, etc.. Therefore a big 5 star rate, and a big Thanks to David Eddings"
1,I didn't like this book at all.,"I thought this would be just as good as the real fantasy all my pals read (Tolkien, Salvatore, Pratchett etc.) and everyone said this book was reeeally good, and that Eddings is the best writer in the world. But reading this book was boring. Really boring. I fell asleep at least twice on every page. Reading became more and more painful with every new page. Finally, I decided to throw the duck with this book! I wonder how all of you liked it that much. And most importantly: Belgarion is even worse. Read them, but remember, you have been warned."
3,Mintolta,"I have mixed feelings about this camera. I have been using it for the past year and have found that while my outdoor picutres come out nicely, indoor shots leave something to be desired. I have tried shots with 200 to 800 speed film and 400 seems to give me the best pictures. I've also noticed that the pictures used with the zoom lense often come out fuzzy, so many of my early pictures weren't too clear. Also, when the camera uses the flash, it takes a while before its ready again. I expected more from the camera, but am happy with its basic outdoor shots."
1,Minolta,"I received this camera as a gift last November (1999). After 3 weeks of use, it started to rewind after only taking 2 or 3 pictures. I returned it to the store where it was purchased and exchanged it for the same model assuming it was an individual camera problem. I was wrong. The red eye reduction feature has never worked. When using the zoom feature, pictures are extremely fuzzy. The only way to get good pictures is to not use the zoom and take picture outdoors. Now the camera has completely quit working. Everything that can blink at me does. I tried replacing the battery and that was not successful. I do not recommend this particular camera to anyone."
4,Not as detailed,"I also own the Field Guide to Magic Kingdom. I found that to be a more detailed but, but with the expansive size of Epcot, that could be part of the problem with a lack of detail. All in all a good book, but only skims the information/history of EPCOT. So I would recommend it as a good place to start learning about EPCOT."
4,"Fun read, but scratches the surface.","I love to read about the designing and background to the evolution of the Parks & Pavillions. Each one gets 2-4 thin pages. I'm still looking for the book that gives the depth that Jason Surrell did for his ""Pirates OTC"" book."
4,"Moving, Exciting and Full of Humor","Steve Gillilan, the director, writer and producer of this independent film gem, really shows his talent here. The characters are richly drawn, the narrative is full of twists tht will keep you on the edge of your seat, and one is really drawn into the film as it progresses. I saw this movie at the International Indepentent Film Festival in New York. I went because I had heard that the director had won a prize in LA and because Variety had given it a rave. I was not disappointed. This is a wonderful film, with terrific direction and writing. I think we will be hearing more from this director. His work is fantastic."
4,Convincing and Well-Done!,"Steven Gillilan has made a very fine film. The casting is excellent, and every actor and actress is convincing in his or her part. I especially thought Tony Sendeas was very good as Nate and Sabrina Gennarino was very concincing as Mattie. The others were also very good--DeVere Jehl as Max, Jennifer Chudy as Mary Webber, Shelley McPherson as Donna, Nathan Taylor as Ian Webber, and Sophie Radoci as Casey Webber. The film held my interest from start to finish, and I highly recommend it."
2,hhhmmmm. great shipping..... but...,"The video arrived quickly and safely. My issue is.. the video truly isnt 'BEGINNING' ballet. if it is? for who? I have danced since the age of two and have been an instructor since 1982. This was for a teen daughter of a friend. She wants to stretch, and learn some beginning ballet ""moves"".. and may enter a studio at a later time. This is NOT what she needed. :( Its quite misleading. Its more for someone who has firm beginning knowledge of ballet terminology, movements and the muscles started and built for these types of movements they are expecting from the viewer. She needs this video in about 1-2 years.It ended up being quite discouraging for her. She felt she couldnt keep up.. and that is simply not the deal."
3,Ballet Class for Beginners,"I was rather disappointed it shows the basic positions and names of positions but is not a ""class"" which is what I was looking for.If you are looking just to be given instruction on each position it will cover that very well. I was looking for a Ballet class exercise that I could do every day to keep in shape."
4,gift to someone,Given as gift to someone who wants to try to learn ballet. very good CD and instructions works as expected
4,Ballet Class For Beginners,"Love this video- just wish he didn't talk so fast, and wish they went through the positions a little slower for us ""newbies"" to comprehend!"
5,A good tape for grade 2 upwards,"I bought this tape for my daughter (aged 10) to practise at home between ballet classes (she takes six hours of ballet classes a week). We have both found it extremely helpful: the pace is very good, the dancer demonstrates positions clearly and has good turn-out and feet. I am not a trained dancer and with the assistance of this tape, I now take part in my daughter's dancing at home. I believe she has improved as a direct result of watching this video. It possibly wouldn't be as useful to someone wanting a keep-fit lesson. It really seems to be aimed at dancers wishing to learn and then improve the basics."
2,Know what you're getting.,"I've read the other reviews of this tape and don't doubt that, if it's what you're looking for, it's a good tape. However, I bought this tape because it was listed as one that those who had bought ""The NY City Ballet Workout"" tape had also liked. Well, if you know the latter tape you know what I was looking for. More of the same kind of workout. ""Ballet Class for Beginners"" is an instructional tape, not a workout tape."
5,wonderful video,"I took my Elementary exam about 10 years ago and am thinking about picking up Ballet again. I have, however, bought this video for my 2 year old cos she loves to watch ballet. We both enjoy the video very much. The ballerina executes the moves very nicely and she has a wonder turn out and arch. The tape shows the steps from basic to advance and from the barre to the centre with clear instruction from David. I think this video is great for those with some basic training in Ballet."
3,Ballet Class Review,"Gave this video to a teacher, as an aid. She told me it was technically very correct, but repetious and did not include musical accompaniment!! We were going to try out the basic film before ordering others, but will not order this item again because of the above reasons."
3,Not for beginners!,"I think is good for people that have taken at least 5 months of ballet, because if you have NEVER done it, its a little hard."
4,Balet for Beginners,Good basic ballet dvd. I enjoy this as a workout. and so does my young daughter.
4,Interesting,Interesting with plenty of information but a little fast to catch up when no previous experience. It is working for us.
2,Not for beginners,"This tape is for, at the very least, advanced beginners and this should be indicated.It moves too quickly into the more difficult movements. Doesn't concentrate on beginner basics. Doesn't give time to repeat a movement. The instruction is too abstract. While this may be useful for someone with experience, it offers very little for those trying to master the simplest beginner movements."
3,Awkward to use while watching,"Because the exercises are not shown for both legs, I found the DVD too awkward to use. One has to stop the DVD, return to the beginning of the section and replay in order to exercise both legs. The sections are quite short, which makes the process really tedious. I wish I'd ordered something else."
4,Easy to Follow with Past Ballet Lessons,I did ballet as a child for many years and wanted to teach my stepdaughter....it was very helpful in helping me remember the names of the ballet steps and the basic moves!
1,Not a class,"I bought this DVD hoping to brush on my ballet skills with a DVD class. Unfortunately it provided no such help. It goes through all the basic steps but does not provide any explanation about things to watch out for or how many times they are going to the exercise. she does some of the exercises on both feet, and some only on one side. I find it very hard to follow and the instruction is terrible. If you want to watch someone do ballet, this is great, but if your trying to follow along, it takes many times of watching before you can follow it. It's not that the steps are hard, they arent, I've danced for 5 years but he doesnt vocalize the class instruction..."
5,great to accompany my classes,"I am an adult beginner taking a ballet class once a week and this video is just what I was looking for. It basically goes through all of the moves we do in class (and more) with some description. It's no typical work out video, but if you get confused in your local class and want some inspiration and a reminder of the moves, it's great!It's a little dated, like you are watching a VHS with lots of grainy video, but the content is worth the price and it's easy to see what the dancer is doing at all times.Again, I am no professional or long-time dancer, but as a beginner, I am very happy with this purchase. There are other videos on the market if you are looking for full workouts. This is like an encyclopedia. It's only 30 minutes long.He talks about use of the head and shoulders and wrists, a lot of little details that I have a hard time picking up in class. The narrator gives a small description before every movement and then discusses it as the video cuts to the dancer."
4,too long,"I like the price, but the actual application is 4 pages long, which is too long. I really wanted just basic info..."
5,What you were looking for and could not find until now.,"This book is the best history of the Qorán I have seen out of hundreds. It's thorough inclusion of the most authentic and ancient information available, together with its indexes of verses and authors is unparalelled. This is the best point of departure available for the study of the origins of the Qorán. It's total impartiality is also unique, making it of interest to both Moslems and non-Moslems who want to know the truth about this fascinating subject. This book includes exerpts from Jeffrey's The Unique ibn al Bawwab Manuscript in the Chester Beatty Museum along with references to every other manuscript known to pre WWII Europe. Many people who have studied this subject have yet to see how much material is a available from the ancient sources. They would be amazed to see how much deeper this search leads after reading Arthur Jeffrey's masterpiece."
1,"Biased, orientalist, misleading translation of a great historical book","This is an inaccurate, biased, sometimes ignorantly misleading and at other times deliberately misleading translation, by an orientalist, of a great historical Arabic book that was written by a Muslim scholar. All the mistakes of the orientalist have been scrutinized, and his claims have been debunked, in an Arabic book and Ph.D. research by Dr. Muhibbuddeen Abdulsabhan Wa'ith, from a university in Saudi Arabia. The Arabic book by that Ph.D. scholar is called ""Kitabul Masahif"", first published in 1995 and the second edition was published in 2002. If you are looking for an accurate translation for this work, then look elsewhere. This translation is just another weapon in the intellectual war against Islam and Islamic history, to mislead and misinform the masses, albeit with a pseudo-academic touch!"
3,Very informational book,"This book can be purchased through the publisher, Oxford University Press, for $79.00 + shipping. The book will be delivered in 6-10 days. Amazon.com is too expensive."
1,why this price???,"I didn't read this book, I think it's really expensive. I am asking myself what kind of so precious informations are contained into thois book. I think a cheaper price will let more users buy and read this book. Where can i borrow this to understand if this book is worth of its price."
5,Excellent!,As a beginner to C# I found this book to be easy to understand and that is important in order to grasp not only C# but also .Net as well.If you want to work with C# this is the book for you.
2,Another fine example of textbook padding to generate sales,"This text is meant as a general overview of the .net framework but it also delves into source code to provide more detailed examples. Unfortunately, this only serves to confuse the reader as many of the examples are not cohesive or clearly explained. There is little benefit in smearing examples over half the textbook if you are not going to take the time to explain them properly. It seems as this was a rush to market product where the examples only serve to make the book thicker. The authors should have made up their minds initially if the text was meant to be an overview or a detailed ""how-to"" book."
2,Details are missing,For topics that I am not familiar with I feel that a lot of details are missing. As such I read the new topic's chapter up to 4 times to ultimately feel that I need another source. As such I consider this book to be a good reference book.On a more positive note the examples that the book gives are abundant and could serve as a starting point for your own development.
1,Poor efforts,"This book I though would give me inside out of the C#. However, half of the book is filled with excerpts of the full source code that is available on the CD. I tried an example code in Chapter 5 that creates a TCPClient, it did not work. The website [website] where the member area is located, doesn't contain any usefull links rather update your profile. While registering, the website gave a SQL Server ODBC error that it could not save the record. However strangely I received confirmation e-mail even after the ODBC error occured. Overall, I am not satisfied with this book. Its just waste of money."
3,Cool book on KISS,Cool book on KISS but the best one I read was KISS & Tell by Gebert and McAdams. That has great first-hand accounts with the band.
5,THIS BOOK IS GREAT & CHEAP!,"This book is a whole book of interviews with the band. It really captures the essence of each of the four guys. I bought it for my boyfriend, and I want to keep it myself!!"
5,"Excellent reference for physicians, med students.","A handy, well-presented and exhaustive survey of the diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of infectious diseases. Its algorithmic style and incredible wealth of information regarding infectious diseases, antibiotics, and the cost of diagnosis and therapy will be invaluable to any professional treating or learning to treat patients."
2,Bag is not as pictured,"This bag is huge. I should have checked the measurements rather than relying on the picture. The bag is much longer than it is tall, not at all like the picture. Only buy this if you need a huge, wide bag."
5,"A sleeper -- not a well known artist, but one who should be!","I bought my 1st Rodrigo Rodriguez CD in a Vietnamese music store (album: Giac Mo Trong Mong) ... don't ask me what that means ... and loved every track of it. Found my 2nd at Amazon, which is this CD. Frustrated by wondering whether there are more CD's or LP's with his music. Can only hope future CD's are in the works for this man. If you like classical or Spanish guitar, this CD should be in your collection."
5,Just works,I used this cable to connect the dual zone pads of my electronic drum kit to the brain. It works fine with no problems.
4,Standard HOSA quality,I have several HOSA cables that have lasted many years. This one looks solid and works fine for extending my Headphone amp box closer to the board.
5,Hosa TRS cables have always been dependable,TRS cables are expensive usually so the quality really matters.These Hosa TRS cables are remarkable and solid.They have lasted me a good while and I always seem to need more of them around as I add gear to my rack.You wont be disappointed in this product or brand name.
5,PERFECT,I ordered 1 of the like 3 weeks ago.. there was some kinda short in it. but Ish happens. I gave em another chance and ordered 2 more. and there was no defect and my speakers sound how they're supposed to. Happy and content with my purchase. and they (2) arrived quickly and the box wasnt beatin up. follow me on twitter @TheDirtyMic.. or listen to my music on youtube... lol just type in my twitter name without the @
4,A great book for understanding business relationships,"I've known my MBTI for many years, so what? It wasn't until I read this book that I understood all the implications. The book goes beyond just explaining your personality type, but actually provides useful information regarding how to deal with each. Information is displayed in great succinct charts covering such aspects as: expression of attitudes, motivators, inner tensions, development recommendations, how the type gathers/absorbs information, valued relationship qualities, as well as hot buttons, prejudices, and other issues. I purchased two copies, one to keep and one to distribute among my team."
1,Spotty book on type--both brilliant and confusing,"Pearman and Albritton are both type experts who offer many personal anecdotes in the use of type. However, their explanations of type concepts at times are very confusing and convoluted. This book can be very difficult to read as a result. It tries to cover too much without giving a solid basis; it is more of an advanced text. The style of writing gets ponderous at points, while at other times is very clear. More consistency would be helpful. The title is very clever and the best part about it."
3,It's textbook not a self-help book,"First - the kindle edition is horrible. It cuts off many of the charts/tables/graphs included in the book.Second - Although the book contains good information. It's really written as a textbook. If you are trying to formally study the subject, then great; but if you are simply trying to get a little insight on different personality types etc... you should reconsider purchasing this book. Other authors have done a much better job of making this topic relatable. (See books by Marti Olsen Laney)."
2,I'm not Crazy I'm just confused with this book,One of the things that caught my attention with this book is the name. Although the book was most informative I was disappointed. I am not sure what I expected but I did not expect to have a headache midway through the book. The book included indepth charts of all differrent types of personalities. Many examples were supplied.The headache was from trying to understand everything. To me the authors should have shared their expertise. The confusion would always come when an explain was followed or precluded with Jung and Brigg's views. I felt overwhelmed with the information. The authors gave their thoughts and had to throw Jung & Brigg's in there too much.I read this on my Sony Reader. Had I had the book in actual print it would have been easier to reference back to charts and parts of the book. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more. Not to sure though.
3,Invaluable resource,"What's wrong with everyone else? I'm normal--they're the weirdos, right? Yes and no. This is a new edition of an invaluable resource for those wishing to learn more about themselves or the people with whom they interact. I'm Not Crazy, I'm Just Not You covers everything from relationships with your colleagues to your relationship to yourself. It's the sort of book one keeps to hand for those dire circumstances where your normality butts heads with someone else's normality. Imminently useful."
5,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!!!","I mean it, I LOVE this album! My fav tracks are Frida Kahlo, Hynotic, Tell Me The Truth, Blind, Sugar and Fall Down. Passionate vocals and lyrics, the sound reminds me of U2 and maybe even Garbage. Meaningful, edgey, BIG, inspiring, and powerful. The music evokes all those ideas and feelings when I listen to it. Great in the car, and it's not bad to dance to! The enhanced CdROM portion is top-notch with a video and other cool stuff, a great buy. Recently signed on Republic/Universal, it won't be long before everyone knows who Molly's Yes is, I have no doubt. Not sure if I can post their website url here, but it's pretty cool and informative...the address is easy if you know how to spell the bands name without an apostrophe or space."
4,Repair forms,This was a new format from the previous version I had purchased with the same item number. Like the old format better.
2,repair order,thought if was the same as a previous order. this form is different. no room on top for our business label.
5,Very well written and beautifully illustrated!,"The author, Sharon Weinbaum, is not only a talented writer, she also has a knack for capturing the very essence of children in her bright, fun illustrations. This story captures the heart and carries it away in a swoosh of color and imagination! A must-have for your child's library!"
5,THE definitive performances of the published scores,"Anthony Halstead opts for the minimal, proper, performance of these on a gorgeous period fortepiano accompanied by minimal solo strings (two violins + cello). I have two integral sets of Op. 7, plus probably 12 performances of Op.7 #5 (arguably J.C. Bach's most popular concerto), I have the scores and I've played them (the keyboard parts). I never thought I'd hear Op. 7 #5 performed so closely to my mind's ear's idea of perfection as I hear here. Halstead is principally a horn player and conductor (one of the very best in this literature), and his keyboard playing has been sneered at on occasion. The star of the Op. 7 is the soloist. Halstead is both spectacular and utterly artistic. Strongly recommended."
3,adequate,"I have two versions of these concertos - these by Anthony Halstead and the Hanover Band, and the version performed by Ingrid Haebler. I also have the Opus 13 concertos by both, as well. While the overall performance of the Hanover Band is fine, the piano performance is sub-par, in my opinion. Halstead, as is noted in another review, is primarily a horn player and conductor. Why he did not get a high-caliber pianist to perform these concertos is hard to fathom. When compared to the Haebler recordings, these come up short. The music, on the other hand is wonderful. If you are not familiar with J.C. Bach, I urge you to get some of his recordings. If you like Mozart, you will definitely like J.C. Bach, and will probably hear why Mozart was heavily influenced by this fine composer."
1,Price Hike,This frigging item just jumped about $700.00 in price in the past day. I had a list together yesterday and was getting ready to place my order today an it went from $3300 to $3900....KEEP IT!
5,Powermatic 3520B Lathe,"Delivery of the lathe was a treat (completely off loaded by the driver into my garage and he would not accept a tip - all within the ""free delivery"" promo by Amazon). The Lathe's product manual is thoughtful, well written, and quite logically done. The crating and packaging of the lathe was simply great. Foil covered the wood pallet base; addition of wood blocks prevented shifting; boxes within boxes and a large thick mil plastic wrap protected the contents (despite a hole/tear in the outside of the box during shipping there was no damage or even scratches to the lathe). The extremely high quality of this Powermatic Lathe will speak for itself. I have been an amateur woodworker for over 30 years. At age 50 I now want to concentrate on platters, bowls, and also turn piano stool seats. This is indeed my dream lathe!"
5,An excellent lathe and problem free delivery,"The powermatic 3520B lathe is exactly what I wanted and it has lived up to all the billing. Delivery worried me since I live in a rural area. The truck backed down a narrow road and lowered the 700 pound box via the lift gage right into my garage. Set up of the lathe was fairly easy BUT attaching the legs on the lathe bed was a real pain. One needs a 8 mm hex wrench to do this properly. I don't understand why the hex wrenches are not supplied with the lathe. In fact you really need a socket wrench to hold the hex piece. I actually had to cut off a 8 mm allen wrench to get this to work. This is a minor problem. The lathe works great, the price was about $500 less than any other supplier I could find, delivery was totally free and included delivery to my garage. Must suppliers do not have free shipping."
5,Best reading ever.,"I HAVE READ EVERYONE OF HER BOOKS.i keep looking to see if she has written any more .I Suggest one should start with SUN CATCHERS ,and get them in sequence I cannot get enough of her writings,Ionly wish she would write another book ,I would be first in line."
1,I lost interest,"I liked the premise of the book - the writer's editor has a thing against Christians so he assigns him to write about them. However, Eldeen's character just turned me off. I know she is supposed to be somewhat eccentric and all, but there were pages and pages of nonsence monologues from her which had nothing to do with anything.Jewel and Joe Leonard's characters were not developed at all well. I did not feel any connection with them. Also, although this appeared to be during current times (he had a computer, etc), Eldeen, Jewel and Joe Leonard appeared in their speech and activities to live in the 1940's.I rarely quit reading a book, but after forcing myself to read over three quarters of it, I quit, no longer caring if or how he and his wife reunited."
4,palmtastic,Found an old palm in my basement and wanted to get it working again. Took a chance and bought this cradle to charge it and sure enough it booted up. I have no real use for either the palm or the charger but for as cheap as it was I got it. Worked well.
1,Not a good value,I wanted a Palm Vx because I love the looks but finally settled on the Palm 3xe for several reasons. 1) The hassle of charging a Vx when travelling is greater than the benefit of not dealing with batteries in general use. And a cradle or more expensive travel kit is needed for use with a second computer or travelling. 2) The cost of Vx accessories are too high. I liked the 3xe because I wanted to hot sync my computer at home (3xe travel cable is only $17 compared with $40 to $50 for Vx) with my computer at work where I used the included cradle (free with purchase). And 3) the bulk of the Vx cases made them as big as the 3xe with included flip lid. And this cradle is $20-$30 on top of the price of the Vx. The bottom line: The the nice looks of the Vx cost $210 more with all the accessories like a case and travel kit. Not worth it. I'd rather have two 3Xe's.
2,Too Expensive,"The Palm V Synch is great. It lets you copy all the data from your Palm to a desktop or laptop, but i find the price of this way too expensive. I want a cradle for my home and one for work, and considering that Palm V's go for about $250 now, i think it is ridiculous that the cradle itself is $50, whereas you can get ones for the Palm III for ~$20. Granted you can recharge the Palm V, i wish they would make a cradle only (no charging capabilities) for people who want to sync their palm in two different places."
4,A good produt.,I bought this Palm V Hotsync Cradle as a replacement to my old one that had been stolen...The cradle itself works great. It is easy to install and required no extra software if you already the Hotsync software installed. A good product.
3,Death Row creepin' while ya sleepin',"The cds are mediocre. Many of the songs are good, yet not great. However, this is wes coast gangsta rap at its finest! Death Row is back and with a vengence. The future looks promisin for Tha Row w/ its new artists Topp Dogg, Mac Shawn, Tha Realest, etc. Tracks to listen to are Disc1 tracks 1,2,&4 and Disc2 tracks 3,4,&5"
3,IT WASNT WHAT I EXSPECTED,"whats up wit them takin out dre and snoop. dre, snoop, pac, outlaws, and the rest of the deathrow records where the shiznit but i cant believe they took out my dawgs like that. top dogg is aight but he sounds alittle to much like snoop but all in all i gots to say its a tight cd and DEATHROW aint never gonna stop bangin on the hip-hop world peace"
3,its alright,"i bought this album the day it came out and after the first time i listen to it i wasnt that pleased, bcuz the guys just sound like knock offs of the originals. the thing that really pissed me off about this ablum was the song by top dogg, cindafella, which sounds similar to snoop's new song snoopafella on his new album top dogg. b4 u buy this one i sugest listening to it first."
5,THE TIGHTEST RAP ALBUM in '99,"THE long awaited return of DEATH Row.. finally a new album dropped....the first good gangsta rap heard since the decline of the ROW.....SUGE has some old inmates back...including DAZ and Kurupt, 2pac, outlawz, danny boy, michel'e. and SOOPAFLY who is finally gettin recognition!!! J-FLEXX and DJ QUICK did some tight beats for this album!! CHECK IT OUT!!!"
5,Death Row still bringing the best Rap,"For everyone who thought Death Row was history: listen to this and you'll be blown away. VK, The realest, Doobie, Swoop G, Top Dogg all new talents waitning to show off. Also 2 great tupac songs inlcuded. BUY THIS ONE"
5,ITS OFF HOOK FOR REAL HIP HOP FAN.!!!!,"I STILL HAVE CHILLS LISTENING TO 2PACS VOICE AND THE TRACKS ARE UNTOUCHABLE TO ANY CD OUT IN THE RAP BUSINESS. I LOVE TO SEE BROTHAS TAKING CARE OF THEIR BUSINESS LIKE THEY SHOULD.""BE LIKE US"" SONG I CANT GET IT OUTTA MY HEAD.LOVEIT!"
1,wack wack wack,chronic 2000 come on there's only 1 chronic album out now and Dre will put the other out soon.keep it real
1,"I bought it, an hour later i was listening to the radio","How can i put this in a nice way.... this cd sucks. As a fan of the O.G chronic I expected more and learned my lesson in buying from suge instead of Dre.. ohhhh and i can confirm that any song having to do with dre or snoop was pulled out of the cd atotal of about 10 songs, leaving this cd with really nothing.Yes tupac, thee greatest rapper ever comes out in this CD, but two songs can't make a CD . He comes out in two songs but only one of them is ok. this Cd delivers a blow to west coastrap but i still wont listen to that weak fluff daddy, jay-zeee and mace , bad boy. As for me i find myself reverting to the classics of West coast rap. In all I was dissapointed terribly . The only reason i made this review is because i feel as if the chronic 2000 ripped me off. Rap limped when eazy-e died but fell when tupac left us."
2,Can a gangsta rap album sell in today's hip hop world?,"If your into that gangsta rap era, this is a must buy. But I think Gangsta Rap died when Eazy-E passed on. The hip hop industry has moved on and I don't think this album will survive on the charts. Not only has the industry moved on, but fans of hip hop have moved on as well. R.I.P. Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright"
4,A classic,I grew up with this album and I love it. When I lost mine a while back I had to replace it. It got to me in perfect condition and arrived in a timely fashion.
3,cant front on death row,"tru tru death row is not what it used to be but they still hold it down for the streets. they still produce SOME bangin music that u can nod your head to. im not feelin top dogg at all cause he sounds too much like another dog that was on death row. the realest is tight on the mic. i was never a pac fan but im feeling his cuts on the album. dogg pound straight holds it down for the row. my favorite cut is""roll wit us"", its listed as da dogg pound but its only daz but it is a bangin cut. vk holds it down for the ladies on a couple cuts. milkbone tries to dis em on his track and it is horrible. im not a big fan of em either but milkbone cant touch him. if youre a death row fan buy this, if not then record it from a death row fan. one."
1,This cd is gonna to be bad,This cd is gonna to be bad. Whats Suge trying to prove by naming it Chronic 2000. That was Dres album name and they stole it. all i can say is that Suge has no class for doing that. Now Dre has class. I heard Dre's changing his Album name anyway. Suge's chronic 2000 wont sell 2 copys and i also heard that Dre's and Snoop's songs are being pulled so it definetly won't sell worth anything. Dre's gonna win a Grammy For his album. Deathrow you can't copy so why you tryin. You cant put out music that could match up to Dre's beats and you Know this man!!!! Forget about Deathrows version because Deathrow is desperate and i heard they got a snoop soundalike named Topp Dogg but you cant coppy the one and only.You want some real music worth buying get Snoop's new Album and Dre's new Album. There is a eight song preview cd Released by Dre for his new album and every song is banging. I mean every song!! Pick up Dre's full Album May 25th and Snoops Album May 11th
3,3.5 Stars,"Now first off yes i do agree most of the rappers brought in to do this project are fake and Tha Realest does sound alot like Pac but thats not what im rating this by, i'm rating just by how good it is atleast in my mind but overall this actually isnt that bad of a cd although Death Row is dead and buried right now and are just trying to sign anybody to try and build their name back up(i.e. Petey Pablo) but this is the last release from ThaRow that you should have anything else is just garbage."
2,"Hiedous, save your money","This is one of the sorriest albums Death Row has released. I really wish I would have listened to it before picking it up, expecially sice it's a double album. There are no flows, beats, and nothing catchy here. On top of that some genious decided to let Big Boy introduce all of the tracks, so you have to put up with that all of the way through. Save your cash."
1,Chronic? How about lame weed.,"I was so sure that after the first Chronic Dre album (maybe the best rap album ever) that the next one would be bangin' I went and told some friends how phat it was before even listen. I mean they wouldnt call it the same name if it wasnt equally as good right? WRONG! Death Row is stright up slippin'. They discrased the first Chronic just by calling the second album the same name. Unless you like that flashy no skill having, goofy beat west coast stuff dont get it. Even for the already sorry west coast music seen it sucked. dont buy it please. I almost cried when I heard it."
5,DEATH ROW IS BACK,"Wow! This album is incredible. It's great to hear real rap music again after being subjected to two years of PuffyTV. 2Pac's ""Late Night"" song is awsome, which is no surprise, but the high quality of the new Death Row artists is a surprise. Top Dogg has the song of the year with ""Cindafella,"" and the rest of the new guys are definately old Death Row qualiity. Dre and Snoop aren't on the copy I have, and the way they've been going lately, I prefer it that way. Sell back your JZ, Nas, and Eminem, and go buy this one."
1,Who Wants some real stuff?,"Tupac can't flow, Suge Knight's beats are recycled. All that was ever good on Death Row was Dr. Dre's beats and flows, Snoop's flows, and Nate Dogg. If you remember things right, you'll remember that when this whole thing started Suge Knight was an NWA bodyguard who fronted some cash to watch Dr. Dre build him an empire. If you want some real hip-hop, look to the streets, to the kids wearing flannels and rocking shows to eat, not the kids wearing gold. Go to Black Market Records if you like California Funk, and check out Loud records if you like old school lyricals. Read about tupac in the latest Rolling Stone, ""His [Tupac's] MC skills are anything but plentiful."
3,DEATHROW ain't a hit anymore !,"I think, chronic 2000 is an average album. The highlights on this double cd are the both tracks with 2Pac (Who Do You Believe In and Late Night). Strictly speaking every track sounds the same."
3,Review,"Only bought for one song, I'm country however it does have some other songs that are pretty good. Well worth the money."
1,Death Row Fell Off!,"anyone who gave this cd more than a couple of stars must beworking for them or something, this CD is pretty weak. The Realestand Top Dogg trying to sound like other people, nothing is funnier than the two of them on the song ""They Wanna Be Like Us"" heh. No one wants to be a fake tupac or a fake snoop dogg like these guys."
4,Charming little book,"This is not a book for die-hards, get ""Picasso on Art"" for an in-depth sourcebook of Picasso qoutes. This book is great for kids for inspiration or girlfriends as a small gift. I would describe it as cute. Has plates of his work on one page and a qoute on the other. A great book if this is what you are looking for."
1,Drivel,"Thoroughly dissapointing. Alschuler starts out with hard science and ends with debunking driven by inductive logic. It became painful to finish and left me with a sense of loss, of my time and money. He even has the audacity to question the integrity of Dr. John Mack and Bud Hopkins. Both of which have dedicated thier lives to the subject while maintaining open minds and objectivity. Alschuler clearly has done neither. He fortifies the argument that our scientific community isn't well along toward better understanding of the nature of the universe but that our scientific community is but a mear toenail removed from the dark ages.Amazon.com's Rob Lightner says that Alschuler tackles the issue of UFOs without dammaging his credibility. How could anyone that relies upon this many assumptions rooted in rudimentary paradigms have credibility?"
2,Good Blather,Though it is refreshing to see a scientist look into the subject this one produces only useless drivel. His other book on the subject is even worse. Reading them is like talking to someone who never shuts up and never says anything worth knowing. But then of course until one comes and eats my garbage I don't beleive in Black Holes.
4,A complex but fascinating read,"Alschuler's book is a fascinating one, though it might prove a difficult read if you cringed during science class. The most interesting part is that it shows how weird our universe really is, but at the same time showing that this ""weirdness"" cannot fully explain the UFO sightings he examines. While his analysis does lean towards the skeptical side of the ledger, he gives the pro-UFO side of things more credence than do a lot of scientists. His use of science fiction stories throughout helps to illustrate his points. I highly recommend this book to science fiction writers as well as people interested in the scientific opinion of the UFO phenomenon."
3,Build Your Own,"I was surprised and a little bit curious as to why William Alschuler failed to mention those in his field who have previously pursued this line of inquiry such as Paul Hill with his extraordinary book Unconventional Flying Objects or Leonard G. Cramp's Cosmic Matrix, both researchers who devoted their lives to studying the phenomena from the perspective of ""monkey see - monkey do"". Neither are mentioned in his bibliography. Never the less, this book, because it deals with the topic, is a worthwhile read for anyone who not only believes in UFOs, but believes they are nuts and bolts, either from secret programs or an other intelligence. I just wish the author had built on previous work instead of starting from scratch. When Sikorsky Helicopters used the Bridgeport Public Library as their own it was filled with an amazing collection of UFO books. When Sikorsky was bought by United Technologies, all these books disappeared. That should tell you something."
1,mac keyboard,hate to give a bad review but the space bar is like a teeder toder and unless you hit it in the center it would not work . I learned my lession stay with apple products
5,Jazz Tributes by Kem,Kem is a wonderful artist! his voice is sooothing and the music is just wondrful!. i would highly recommend this to my friends
3,NEW JAZZ KID,I was not familiar with this artist's music so I am still out on whether I would purchase him again. CD sounded a bit 'nasal' to me. Not sure why.
5,Smmoth Jazz Tributes kem,"If you love Kem, you will love this smooth CD. This CD not only makes you think of all Kem's tantalizing music, but brings your stress level down to relax and do whatever makes you happy. I highly recommend it. It is even better if you have a significant other to listen with you."
3,LOVED the casserole queens. Ruby? Not so much,"Ruby McQueen is the perfect child. At least she was, until she met Travis, the boy who thinks she's fearless. Ruby finds herself terrified and deeply enchanted by Travis. He gets her to do things she never would have done before, terrible, dangerous things. She knows it's wrong, but for some reason she just can't tear herself away from him.Ruby made me really aggrevated. I found myself screaming at her inside my head, which might be what the author wanted, but it was very annoying for me. The only things that made me keep reading were the casserole queens and Chip Jr. Chip Jr. is Ruby's little brother, and I loved how concerned he was of her, and how much he loved her. THe casserole queens were a hoot! They are the book club that Ruby's mother runs. They are feisty seniors who can't stop judging people. I would often skim through the book just to read the Casserole Queens' parts."
4,Great - but a bit long winded.,"Honey. Baby. Sweetheart. is a romance novel with a tinge of action and adventure. Main character, Ruby, falls in love (or more likely lust), with the rich and charming, Travis Becker. As the plot grows thicker, the story tends to switch up. This book only gets 4 stars because the story is long, and the ending was somewhat dissapointing (and because I can't Amazon won't let me put 4 1/2 stars.) Beautifully written and full of vivid characters, everyone who reads it will be charmed by this book."
2,A let down,I was expecting so much more when I started to read this book. But I found it too long and very boring. Ruby whines way too much and drags the whole Travis issue on for far too long. The only reason I stuck with the book was to see how the side story with the Casserole Queens turned out. I recommend reading this only if you like sappy love stories.
4,Great book.,"Honey, Baby, Sweatheart was a really great book. It was about a girl stuggling with her inner self and trying to become one with her wild side. She stuggles alot with it. She meets a boy who has motorcycle and is deffinetly alot crazier then herself. Her mother makes her go to a book club at an old peoples home, so she can learn some lessons and learn to be herself. She does this and lears alot about herself just like her mother daid. She goes on adventures with this club and really finds herself. Overall this book was good. But it could have been better."
3,"Honey, Baby, Sweetheart","This was an okay book. I would have liked it better if it were shorter and had a better plot. I found myself getting bored and didn't really want to finish it, because you can tell by the way the author writes that everything will be let go in the end. But, this book did have some good points to it. It just wasn't the greatest book."
4,"Thoughts on Honey, Baby, Sweetheart","It is a good book. Honey, Baby, Sweetheart is about the one thing everyone can, on some level, relate to--love. Love is important and effective, no matter how old or a young a person is.The message of the book is that everyone has a story. No one is ever how you perceive them. They have a past. They have secrets. They have a life that you don't know about. Elder people aren't just old. They became that way. Therefore, they were once young and experienced much of the same that we do today. They had an adventure. Life's an adventure.I did like the book. I was able to relate to it on several levels. There were times, though, when I felt as if the writing was lagging. It started to slow down. Other than that, it was great.""We are all a volume on the shelf of the Nine Mile Falls Library, a story unto ourselves, never possibly described with one word or even very accurately with thousands.""--Deb Caletti, Honey, Baby, Sweetheart, page 301"
5,Permanently housed in my top 5,"This book changed my life. This book changed my life. (Once more, with feeling: ) THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE. I think it should be required reading for anyone with ovaries, regardless of age. I'm going to butcher the story by trying to one-liner it, but it's basically a good girl falls for a bad boy arc, with so many phenomenal character sketches and side plot lines. The main character's mom runs a book group for the elderly, and those characters do amazing things throughout it, including the scene that made me put the book down because I was crying too hard. She deals a lot, in a perfectly developed but still subtle way, with expectations put on girls vs expectations on boys, even as kids-that boys get to be adventurous and how it's supposed to be enough for the girls to settle for having the boy and not having the adventure. ""Boys get mountains, girls just get boys."" Every word of this novel is perfect. National book award finalist, as well."
4,Stop before you go blind,"I am new to Honor Harrington, having arrived at David Weber via ""Off Armageddon Reef.""This story brings back several of Honor's crewmembers to man Q-Ships as pirate hunters in a system well away from the frontlines of the Haven/Manticore war. It is an engaging story and a relief from gigantic ships of the wall slamming each other in set-piece battles.My primary purpose in writing this review is to warn readers away from the Baen/Windhaven version. I have written to both the publisher and printer regarding the numerous read-ability issues this version has. First, the printing itself is too light and is on a nearly-tan paper...resulting in these old eyes needing more light that expected. Second, the binding encroaches upon inside margins. Third, the kerning is tight enough to further reduce the legibility of the type.Looks like this one fell through the QC net.Good story, well worth the read. Beware this edition."
4,Good and fills in the gaps,"Well, Weber is the master of space combat even if his approach is somewhat conventional. This book really shouldn't be as good as it is given the events it covers, but Weber as always rises to the occaision. It becomes obvious by the end of the book though that its mostly a vehicle to introduce some Havenite characters other than Theisman we can cheer for. It also begins to de-stupify the Havenite forces making them a bit more of a threat for the next couple books. Middle stories frequently struggle, but this one doesn't and is highly recommended."
3,A below par efficiency rating for Mr. Weber,The latest Honor novel is not one of the best. It is rather bloated--at 500 plus pages--to the extent that Honor is not really even the main character. It takes about 200 pages to get to the main story and then meanders to a disappointing climax. Another problem is that Honor has become such an icon that all the relationships with her are like those to a demi-goddess rather than a human being
4,Another in this fine series.,"If you liked the previous books in this series you will not be disappointed in this one. Once again David Weber has written an entertaining story of courage, convictions and, above all, honor.Having said that, be warned that the entire scenario of space battles seems contrived and artificial. In essence, the author needed a way to reproduce or create standard naval battles in outer space. They are fun to read but you will wonder why a single nuclear missle can't destroy a spaceship. Reality aside, Honor Harrington should be required reading for anyone ever called upon to defend their country."
3,Flaw in the wood that goes through the bowl.,Still usable as salad bowl. The quality control could be much better. Will not be purchasing the match bowls or tongs.
2,It locks....,"Well the cabinet locks, but it is entirely made of plastic. The electronic code resets back to the factory setting when the batteries are removed also. I gave it two stars because it does lock, but I don't think it could keep keys away from anyone older than five."
3,Question how well it will hold up long term,"I'm pleased with this item - however, I am concerned how well it will hold up over time. It's 99% plastic and wonder whether the latch on the door will survive with numerous individuals using it several times a day. One wrong tug on the door may break the plastic latch mechanism making it useless.If I were to make this purchase again I'd probably look for a more substantial device.Tom"
3,Somewhat limited space,"This is a quality product, however I feel that the materials feel flimsy at times. If you have large key rings, they won't fit without some effort."
4,Serves The Purpose,This item serves the purpose well compared to what I had. A friend of mine shared his review of the item and it works well for what I need.
3,Re other comment,"At first I was going to ask if the first review was done by a rep for the other book since it's not even set to be released for another ten days but I noticed that you didn't get the author's name right so I'll just leave it at that.I have to agree that this book is pretty basic. I pre-ordered and waited almost two months to receive it in the mail and, well, not to say that it wasn't useful but the programs are simple and intuitive enough that it was easier to get through the projects by trial and error."
2,Book lacks much information.,"After glancing through the book I was very disappointed. The introduction told you that this was not a comprehensive guide and it was merely a supplement to other information such as the help and Jim Held's book. This was not stated in the information on the book. If that's the case, why not get Jim Held's book? I was particularly interested in iWeb. The information given for iWeb was sparce. It merely gave information on setting up a page and importing pictures from iPhoto onto the web page. It said nothing about links and other important web information. Perhaps it was on the disk. I dont know. I never opened the disk because I knew I wanted to return the book. The only reason I gave it two stars at all was because it said that the disk contained turorials."
3,"Make a Choice, Meal or Many Banquets","Give a man a fish or teach a man to fish. To use this analogy might be slightly abstract.But, there are two I-life books out there. I prefer the one by Jim Haid. He seems to teach you more about the I-life process as compared to a step by step instructions which leaves a lot out of what I-life is capable of doing. And believe me, there are secrets about I-life that that are dangerous to know.(Join Apple Pro Care and ask.) None the less, Jim gives an abundance of fairly easy information to follow and allows any creative inclinations you might be burdened with to blossom. Jim's version also has a great DVD that enhances the instructions in the book. Get his version and enjoy many banquets or this choice and eat a very nice meal."
4,Work fine; audio fidelity is just decent,"These work fine if you need a balanced cable. That said, the audio fidelity is just decent. Not great. But they're passable and accomplished what I needed."
5,Superb!,"Having had the pleasure of meeting this compassionate and passionate man, it was such a blessing to read his words describing his growing years in a crazy world. It was inspiring and though much of the content was pretty gritty, there was a lot of beauty to be found. I'd recommend this to everyone!"
1,Bad choice.,"Stockton's presentation was boring and repeatitous. The date on the video profile was 1994, but it was so boring that I resented the time I spent watching and felt mislead into thinking it was a recent production...it appeared to have been filmed in the late 70's. A real waste of time."
4,"Excellent data, pesky language problem","The information is relatively easy to locate, and seems to be well researched for real world conditions, however there is that unfortunate spelling and word choice. Australian is much easier to understand. It is worth having if you own one of the XJS', in fact it may be an imperative."
1,Not as good as they say.,I am a collegiate racer and well these tires just dont cut.The tire flatted twice with in the first week in two different places. And then once again a couple weeks down the road. If you include the cost of tubes and co2 you are better off buying better tires to begin with.The tire ate 3 tubes and 3 C02 cartridge so that brings the total price of the tire to roughly 44 dollars. I am sure you can find a cheaper more dependable tire for that price.
4,the love generation explodes,"a rocket-ride through the sixties, beginning with the tender coming-of-age story of two high school kids discovering sex in the land of the free and blasting on into almost william burroughs-hunter thompson-like scenes of degeneracy, drugs and violence, including a shocking double suicide that the author describes with great skill. there seems to be a message here that the sixties opened up new vistas for personal search, but few found what they thought they were looking for. a little more cohesion and the book could have been a novel instead of a story collection, and my impression is that it was first intended as a novel. a good read anyway."
2,not a good value,"I bought this [new] from a different website and installed it per the instructions. It is intended to keep a birdbath full, and it seemed to work right away, but the next morning the float was under water, and the birdbath was overflowing. The problem turned out to be a bad seam [the float is made in parts and glued together], and it filled with water. I contacted the distributor, and they sent me a replacement which worked ok. For over $[...] [incl. shipping] though, this is not a good value, even though customer service was good. There are others out there that are less expensive and just as good if not better."
1,Now that 'Echoes' is out - this CD is obsolete,"The 1 star is to get your attention. The actual songs here are good, but drawn mostly from 4 Pink Floyd CDs. (The Wall, Animals, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here.) The CD is only 45-minutes and the ""Money"" version is a subtle re-recording. Now that the 'Echoes' Best-of is out,you can get all of the songs here on that compilation. (At a cheaper price, and with about an hour-and-a-half of more music.) This CD should be deleted - it just isn't necesssary anymore."
1,It deserves 0 stars.,"I love Pink Floyd. Love them. But this album confuses me. Why was this made? I'm not the kind of person who would dance to Pink Floyd. Actually, PF isn't the kind of band you dance to. This album was obviously released to bring in more money for the record company. If you're a new fan to Pink Floyd, don't buy this album. If you're a die-hard Pink Floyd fan, don't buy this album. If you're looking to waste some money, buy it then. This album is an insult to Pink Floyd and even compilations in general."
1,"Nice art, terrible science","If you're looking for a rehash of a few good old articles, plus a set of new articles that are in general of very poor quality, and some decent artwork (most old, some new) then this book is fine for you.But if you're looking for quality dinosaur science, then this book will greatly disappoint you. The new articles are laden with assertions lacking in concrete data, are generally awful in writing quality, and offer a very narrow view of dinosaur science, with alternative viewpoints barely mentioned. These articles' authors are just a few of the editor's friends, not the best and brightest in the field. Together, these new articles destroy the quality of the book, in my opinion. They are sad, weak, shameful science. I was very disappointed."
1,buyer beware!!!!!!!,This movie is still not up to a better quality. Since it has 2011 release mod its still the same box and the picture is still dark. A good movie with the horror superstars but could have been a lot better.
5,Jewish-American family life,"I saw Family Business years ago on PBS, with Milton Berle in the lead role as Isaiah Stein, successful but dying businessman with four sons, and was impressed at the family saga and conflict of the father dealing with the different Stein brothers. Milton Berle surprised me with his convincing performance. The brothers:1) Bobby Stein is a widowed businessman, hard-edged but honest.2) Dr. Phil Stein is a ""goniff,"" a greedy, unscrupulous man who is vainly trying to impress his father.3) Jerry Stein is a closet homosexual who is part owner of a gay discotheque.4) And finally Norman, the traditional Jew, studious, scrupulously honest, observing holidays, and a Kosher kitchen.For a modern, ethnic, serious comedy, you can't beat it."
3,Great picture,"The Sony DVD player gave a great picture, but I have to admit along with the other reviews the volume is too low. I used it on a recent trip. My brother and I both brought our DVD players. His was a $150.00 low end name brand. We shared each others players. His volume was twice as loud as the Sony, but the picture was half as good."
4,DVP FX 705,"The picture and sound are great. I took it on a road trip recently and was pleased. The remote works wonderfully. I did notice one glitch though, and that was maybe in the third or fourth episode the words coming out of the actors mouths were delayed. So I hit the next button bakwards or forwards then went back to the episode and it would play correctly.It was weird it happened a couple of times but all in all I am pleased."
4,Does the job,"I researched portable players a long time before choosing this unit.While some say the sound volume is not loud, I would disagree. Screen quality is good.I like that the battery clips on. If running off A/C or in the car, you can remove it.Battery life better than expected.The only quirk is no volume control on the remote. You'll get used to it.A very good choice and worth the $."
2,colts golf bag,I was a little disappointed in the fact that the bag I received was not the one shown here...the bag we received is very different in appearence than the bag I ordered....Margaret Peruccio
5,Temptations Raw,"This is raw temptations before all the glitz and glamour. Most of the selections from the early days have great funky arrangements without the violins or a ""white man"" studio mix. I'm white and this is what I like... the real stuff from the streets. Remix is well done. Arrangements are excellent and the studio musicians are ""right on!"""
5,Great Popcorn!,"I love this popcorn. The last time I ordered it, it came in 12 packs and for some reason most of the oil in the packaged leaked out into the outer plastic wrap. So I was glad that these came in 3 packs 'cause I figured maybe the 12 pack was just oo heavy or something. None of the oil problems exist in the 3 packs so I'm glad I switched. Plus these are on Subscribe & Save I think (or maybe it's the other popcorn I ordered (can't remember right now). But either way, I'll eitehr be automatically getting more, or will be re-ordering this because it's very very good. it pops up so white and tender and tastes just wonderful."
2,"Not tender, greasy bag, no flavor","I bought this based upon the reviews from others. I was disappointed. The oil inside the bag had soaked through to the outside (yuck!). It popped up small and tough, rather than fluffy and tender. I prefer Pop Secret Light Butter."

4,Well worth the price,"For the price, you can't beat this holster. I bought three. One for regular use, one for a backup, and one to cut up and drill holes in to mount on my vehicle dashboard so the phone could charge and I could use a headset while driving. It worked great. My phone and holster fell off my belf in my employer's parking lot (due to not securing it well) when I was cleaning snow of the windshield of my car and I found it four hours later embedded in the track of a truck tire. The holster was still in fine shape. The phone did not fare as well, but still works."
1,these guys are fake...,Some of this is the REAL Leroy (not Lee Roy) Mercer but some of the calls aren't. The real Leroy Mercer was Johnny Bean and Roy D. Mercer and Lee Roy Mercer have been copying him for years. Do a search for Leroy Mercer aka John Bean and read the real story. Johnny cussed and threatened but he never was as crude and vicious as these guys.
2,"Nothing special, but OK","These hazelnuts are nothing special. I don't want to compare them to fresh nuts off the tree, but they are no better than the bulk nuts I find at Whole Foods or at the local Trader Joe's here in the US. These are not worth a special order from this seller because shipping is expensive, but if you can't find hazelnuts at all where you are, these will be acceptable."
2,Decent,"For the price its is nearly adequate for the task. You do get static and pop under load so that really disappoints. I partly wanted it to record audio digitally from the PC directly to an external digital device but its difficult to get a clean digital feed. If I had paid a few more bucks, I would return it but for the price I think I can live with it."
1,Don't believe the ad,"This device will not decode dolby digital. It only passes thru a dolby digital signal to an external decoder, and I could not even get that to work over the coax or optical inputs. I guess for what I paid it is OK, but what I want is to get true dolby digital to my A/V receiver from my notebook via digital (optical or coax) connection. The ads make it sound like this is all you need. Don't believe it and don't buy it !!!!"
4,Great for its price,"It is a great external sound card. It made great sounds of my music on a computer. I am glad I bought this. I have a very low-end desktop PC, which has a terrible on-board sound card. This external sound card makes it all different. It is a bargain for what I paid ($39)."
3,laptop yay or nay,"bottom line:if you have a laptop, this is for you. but if you have a PC, just bone up and get a PCI sound card. I bought this thing, but was sorely disappointed by the performance, it skipped a lot under load, even on my new sc420. i ended up returning it and going with a soundblaster live 5.1 pci sound card, it was 25 bucks, snapped into the slot, and has been nothing a joy.so yeah, if you have a laptop, this is a deal. don't forget to pick up a set of logitech x-530's, they were 40 bucks AR from amazon!"
2,"Many problems with optical output, Poor customer support","I use it to connect my PC to a receiver via the optical link, but I find the mute button, the volume control, the headphone all stop working. The PC flashes the message ""invalid speaker configuration"".I then called the customer support. The guy had no clue, keeping saying ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""possible""... In the end, he concluded it was supposed to work that way (of malfunction)."
3,DTS pass through doesn't work,"I tried to hook it up to my Sony MDR-DS3000 virtualDolby Digital Headphone using its optical output, and pass through the DVD's AC3 or DTS sound directly to the decoder of the headphone for decoding. The AC3 pass through works fine, but when I switch to DTS, sound become discontinuous plus horrible distorting noise. My old SouldBlaster MP3+ works fine for this. Anybody know what's wrong? Otherwise I am going to return it."
4,Best with dedicated USB 2.0 port,"I don't have a fancy speaker system, but this still offers an improved sound quality comapred to my laptops internal sound card. Unfortunately, there is some static when I plug it into a USB 2.0 hub sharing the port with my printer, and camera, so I need to give the aurilium a usb port all to itself. Also, there can be some skips when the CPU is busy on my Pentium M 1.2Ghz laptop, but I think those might only be occuring when it's in battery saving 600Mhz mode."
1,Philips PSC805 does not work on mac mini,"I have a Grifith stereo hub and it works great. I tried to go to the 5.1 device and no luck no sound. the mute light doesn't light, the selector doesn't light. the volume control does open up a volume pane on the mac and it does reduce the onboard mini sound, but nothing outta the psc805. I did read a writeup on a mac G5 that it was working. I'll try to work with Griffith support but I'm gonna write off the thing at $40. The box says PC only, and the software said pc only , that should have been a clue!"
3,Not really 24-bit 96KHz capable.,"I was about to order this based on the description of the item being 24-bit 96KHz capable. According to Philips own technical data sheet specifications it is a 16-bit 48KHz device for playback and recording. Most people won't care, but I did. Having a portable midi compatible device would be nice at this price."
4,"My First ""True"" Cajun CD","I listened to, and subsequently purchased this recording after reading another Amazon reviewer's review of a contemporary Zydeco CD. The reviewer said that he/she liked the Zydeco recording, but ordinarily preferred traditional Cajun music, such as that of Michael Doucet. This is great--wonderful upbeat tunes with great vocals. It's fun to try to decipher the lyrics, and it reminds me of learning to read Shakespeare for the first time. Once you get used to it, it's fairly easy. If you're a fan of the various Zydeco groups and haven't yet discovered Doucet, check it out."
5,This course has everything you need!!!,"This is a complete course on how to fix quartz watches and quartz clock movements.Dan is a master at giving detailed, but understandable, directions on the repair and marketing of quartz watch repair. A must see if you want to make money in the watch repair business."
5,Love this series.,"Sanra writes so well, and I am always interested, even when I think I 'know' I really don't. Sign of great mystery as far as I'm concerned. Love this whole series, wish she'd write more!"
4,good box,This a reasonably well designed battery box with an also well designed lid. Unfortunately the tie down strap is not as well designed. There are no instructions and the strap holds down the lid loosly with no easy way to lock the box.
5,The best money I spent in '98,"Just when I thought it was the early 70s all over again, with the Jewels and MacLachans and their ilk taking over the airwaves, along comes a woman who's not afraid to turn it up and let it rip! Sure, the supporting cast is great ( Richard Lloyd produced and contributes several fine solos ), but what'll keep you coming back again and again is Bibi's songs. The writing's so vivid, you'll feel you know the characters, and it's all delivered in a pure, clear and unaffected voice. Take a chance a buy it - you won't be sorry."
5,Government Abuse of Power,"James Bovard explains, point blank, how the United States government has grown into an uncontrollable monster, negatively impacting each and every one of us, and taking away many basic rights that were once taken for granted.There is no denying that power corrupts. Give a politician the authority to pass one oppressive law and, eventually, more and more oppressive laws will follow. Government has become increasingly intrusive, unethical, and dishonest over the years as more and more special interest legislation has made its way through congress.This process did not take place overnight and it will not be eliminated overnight. Americans must work for change first on the local level, leading up to the state and national levels. We must act quickly before it is too late. I hope that many people will read this book and take action. A totalitarian United States government is closer than we think."
4,Good food for thought,"When you have no one reporting to you, your job is largely determined by your supervisor. However, when you are a manager, the people who work for you can either ensure your success or make it virtually impossible. This book gives you a lot to think about in terms of how to systematically identify, recruit, and retain the best performers- those people who will make you look best. While I don't agree with all the specifics, the areas discussed are vital to consider. The book is also well written.The only real downside to this book is that it assumed the employees' market of 1999-2000 would last forever. While that's not true, and companies may accidentally, in employer's markets, be able to get good employees, the best employees will flee to companies that treat them right when the market turns."
1,Deceptive advertising,"After purchasing this product I investigated why the weight of this clock was listed at over 20lbs. I called as an inquisitive potential customer and I was told they sell the clocks at a reduced price but they make up the difference by increasing the weight, therfore the shippings charges are increased. The actual weight is only 6 lbs. After confronting them, they told me they told me they use ""extra heavy boxes and extra packaging"" with their shipments. They finally agreed to refund the shipping difference, but the next day they sent an email to confirm they cancelled the order that was already shipped because they wanted happy customers. Don't waste your time with Ezshoponline Inc."
3,Chayanne -Vivo,"The show was awesome, but the reception was a bit poor. I was surprised that it starts off that Chayanne is singing without introducing himself. Its not til mid show he finally saids his name. I love this performer, but was a bit disappointed with the outcome. He did perform well, with plenty of energy, but I was expecting a more personal connection with the people."
1,Disappointed,"Great song selection for Chayanne fans, but the quality of the DVD was poor. It looked like amateurs produced this DVD. The audio was good, but the visualwas very disappointing. I have purchased several concert DVD's from amazon, and this by far was the worst visually I have ever seen."
2,Boring!,"He is a very moderate singer at best.the dancing was just okay. ( I expected the dance routines to be great; (because I know what a good dancer he is); but, they lacked something."
3,"Very entretaining, video quality so so",I really enjoyed the DVD and I do recommend it. Chayanne did a great show and the audio is great. My only disapointment was the video quality. It looks like a video from the 80s.
3,Camera work not for the queasy,"The show is fantastic, although it did make me wonder if Chayanne was really singing throughout the whole concert.My only criticism is that the camera work is ""too fancy"" yet bordering on tacky. A lot of slow-mo and swaps that really weren't necessary.If you like Chayanne's music - definitely one you should get, maybe not if you're queasy."
3,Be careful,"As much as I love Prevage, this version caused an allergic reaction on my nect and face. This version is so strong, even one drop mixed with water still caused me to go red and swollen. Everyone is different, so if your not allergic, then it is a wonderful product. Just be cautious when using."
5,Prevage MD the Best,"This is a must have product for me. I would throw away all makeup, cleansing products, and moisturizers just to use this one product. It restores the Ph balance and normalizes and smooths my skin. Well work the money."
3,I'm allergic too!,"Apparently, I'm allergic to it. Makes the area around my eyes redden and swell. I would suggest putting a little on your arm before applying to the face for the first time."
1,Problems with the ingredients,"I bought 2 of these as gifts for my daughters. I have used Prevage for some time now and wanted to see if they would like this. Both of them had allergic reactions to the product and could not use it. They gave it to me, and upon use, I realized quickly that it is not the prevage I have been using. I will not purchase this again."
1,Caution,"I was given a sample of Prevage by my dermatalogist. Applied it one time. I am not particularly sensitive to lotions, etc. Woke up 24 hours later with eyes swollen shut and face bright red, burning and swollen so that I was unrecognizable. My doctor ordered Prednizone to counteract the allergic reaction and I am doing better. I have since heard of others with the same reaction. Will probable take a week to subside, hopefully with no lasting effects. Beware, this is a strong treatment. I would definitely not apply any without a skin patch test first."
1,DO NOT USE THIS UNTIL YOU TEST THIS PRODUCT ON A VERY SMALL AREA,"I used this product on my face after being recommended to use it by a dermatologist. I used a pea sized portion and immediately my face turned beet red. Five days later still have a red rash on my cheeks and down the left side of my face. I have been to a clnic to receive a shot(as it was a Friday night) and get a Rx for a dose pak. I now have to use cortisone cream take an allergy pill(a.m. and p.m.), dose pak, cold compresses to my face went back to the dermatologist on Monday. This might be a wonderful product but please whatever you do test it on tiny area for a few days before using on your whole face.7-15-2011It is now almost 2 years later and I still have a severe reaction on my face when I go out in the sun. That is what I do all summer I am a gardener but I can no longer do this from putting one pea sized portion of Prevage M.D. on my face one time!"
1,Prevage Smells funny!,"I bought Prevage MD from my dermatologist for $135.00 and as soon as I put it in my face I noticed a funny smell, it also gave me a rash after just 2 days. I bought Visage MD with 1.5% Idebenone and I love it, it has no smell and it has repaired my sun damaged skin. Buy Visage MD instead of Prevage, you will be a lot happier.Gloria De La Ruz"
5,Awesome anti-aging,This product is awesome for mild to moderate aging signs in the face and neck!!! It is well worth the money!! The dermatologist charged twice as much in her office for this product.
1,Another allergic reaction-- Use extreme caution!,"I, too, had a terrible allergic reaction to Prevage. This product couldn't have made my skin look -- and feel -- worse if it had been made with poison ivy! I broke out in a red, itchy blistering rash all over my face and neck. My eyes were swollen, my face was puffy and itchy! I do not have very sensitive skin and have never reacted to anything the way I have this product. I recommend testing it on a small area for several nights, and wash your hands thoroughly after you apply. I would give it zero stars if I could. A very expensive disaster!"
1,WORST PRODUCT EVER -- TERRIBLE REACTION,"I've used many products and have undergone various minor cosmetic procedures (microdermabrasion, laser genesis and photofacials) and I've never had a reaction. After using Prevage MD for two weeks, my race erupted in a rash-- itchy, red, bumpy and swollen. It's so bad that I have to take steroids and apply topical cortisone. I have NEVER experienced something like this and hope that nobody has else has to go through it. I now look terrible, feel very uncomfortable and have to take off days from work to hopefully re-cooperate. Please don't risk your face on this product, it's not worth it."
1,Prevage MD causes rash,This product causes a rash on my face when used every other day. I've had to stop using it all together until the rash goes away. I'll see if my skin tolerates its use on a twice weekly basis.
2,Allergic Reaction,"Hi, I bought this product with high hopes afer reading some great reviews. I used it for about a month and did not really notice any improvement in my skin (but sometimes it is hard to tell when you look at yourself everyday). I didn't recieve any compliments about how great my skin looked during this time, but I thought, hey, just give it time..... than after about a month, my face swelled up....bad. I thought that if I continued using it, that the reaction would go away and I would see some results, so I continued using it for over a week and my face looked BAD. It was swollen and looked like I was a having a serious allergic reaction. It was bumpy and red and itchy and I looked like I was recuperating from a bad sunburn or chemical peel. I had to stop using it, I was in so much pain. I tried it again after a couple weeks and instantly my face was swollen and red again for 3 days. Sigh.... I was really hoping this would work. Back to the drawing board......"
2,Not overly impressed,"Well, at first it ""seemed"" to improve the look and appearance of the skin on my arms, which received a lot of sun damage as a kid and appeared significantly older than my 45 years (mostly age spots and fine dry-skin wrinkles). I wouldn't say that the improvement was dramatic - just a vague lightening of the age spots and mild improvement in wrinkling over the first half of the bottle - but at over $100.00 I was expecting better results and it didn't help that the stuff has a rather offensive smell (though that doesn't linger for a long time), so I opted to skip the next bottle for more cost-effective treatments..."
5,Great CD!!!!!,"If you've ever listened to the music of Percy Faith, then this is a must for you. I've recently purchased this CD a few months ago. One of my favorite arrangements on this CD include Feelin' Groovy, Yellow Days, There's A Kind of Hush, Music of the Night, Release Me, and many more. Percy's orchestra and backup singers really make this CD a delightful one to listen to. I've taken a trip up to New Jersey in November & listening to this CD along the way up is so relaxing. If I were you, this would make a great Christmas present."
3,Item Arrived but WRONG ONE,"The CD arrived in very good shape but it was the WRONG CD title. I have tried valiantly to return it for the proper one using the proper channels to do it as told to me in their invoice but so far no good. I have received no communications at all from the seller. I have just gave up, moved on, and chalked it up to experience."
2,First Grade Skills,"I really needed the book so I bought it used. It was quite expensive to say that the book was in poor shape. The cover was badly bent. the pages were dog eared. For the price, I was expected a book in better shape."
4,Ancient Future Faith,"Campbell's thesis is that John Wesley not only eclectically imbibed aspects of the theology of the fathers of the ancient church, he saw the life and practices of the ancient church as a model whereby English society of his own day could be transformed. Wesley, for instance, was initially enamored with the Vincentian canon that states, ""That is Catholic which has been believed, everywhere, always and by everyone."" Later on Wesley came to realize the difficulties of applying the criteria of ""everywhere, always and everyone"" to every given theological question or situation. He began to take on a more nuanced view of the value of church councils and showed a marked dislike for St. Augustine. One parishioner during his missionary stint in Georgia exclaimed, ""Mr. Wesley, I know that this other man is an Anglican but what religion ye are I know not!"" Wesley's appropriation of antiquity was unique."
4,"Nice addition to your collection, Jonny","Some of the best songs by some of the best underground (at least nationally) bands to come out of Boston (one of our best cities, no?), but like all compilations, not everything is good, and a few songs are hardly worth hearing. Still, I recommend it just because the good stuff is SO GOOD, and there really is a lot of it. You can't beat the Real Kids, Mission of Burma, Human Sexual Response, and the impossible-to-find-elsewhere Cars track. It's a good overview of what was happening with non-pop music in one of the liveliest cities of the time. The best of the discs in this series, in my opinion. Bring the noise!"
4,Great stocking filler,"Okay so none of the episodes are very Christmassy, but The Littles was a great quality cartoon. You get 4 unedited episodes at a great bargain price. Perfect for a stocking filler - which does make it fairly Christmassy lol. I've just bought mine in time for Christmas and can't wait to be taken back to the 80s! It's also a great taster for those wanting to get the complete series on dvd."
4,Pleasant little surprise of a book,I really enjoyed this book. While it wasn't the quality that most thrillers are up to it was still pretty good. I especially enjoyed the fact that even the bad guys wound up being (mostly) civilized folks in the end.
2,Not for strength training,"I bought this set of DVD's thinking that it was going to be a step by step tutorial on how to strength train like a gymnast. It's not! This set of DVDs is meant for coaches or athletes to train for SKILLS not for strength or conditioning. I bought this product because at the time the gymnasticbodies.com website were out of stock of the book ""Building the Gymnastics Body"", so I chose this as an alternative. Unless you want to learn how to tumble or do handsprings, you should skip this product. It is not for an average joe that simply wants to do planche push ups or front lever pullups and other gymnastics strength exercises. This product for gymnastic athletes that want to perform the skills required in the sport."
5,30 key cabinet review,"We bought this product to replace a small real estate-type lock box. We operate a fleet of 47 medic trucks, and these can be dispatched at any hour. This lock box allows us secure storage of many vehicle keys, and mounted outside our building for easy access. It is a secure cabinet with plenty of room for our dispatch keys. There are hangers inside for 30 sets of keys. The lock mechanism is trouble free and the unlock is easy for even beginners to use. The combination can be set or changed easily and instructions are printed on the tool used to set the combination. The tool is stored inside the box, right on the lock mechanism. The price was very reasonable, making this GE key cabinet an outstanding value for anyone who needs a bigger lock-box."
4,Nice product,"This is nice unit, it is heavy duty. Without the combination, the knob just spins. My complaints would be that it it small to house 30 keys. Also the combination, can be set to the numbers of your choice, however those numbers can be pushed in any combination to get the unit to unlock."
5,A great key cabinet,"This key cabinet is made of heavy metal, solid construction and has adequate room for keys to hang on 30 hooks. My only negative comment is towards the small plastic key labels. I chose not to use them and have used larger circular key labels attached to all the key rings. Overall an excellent cabinet for key storage, easy to mount on wall and is secure."
2,Touchpoint = Cheap,"I've had this box for about 18 months. It is great to have all of my keys in one spot. But, as other reviewers have experienced, the Touchpoint lock is a piece of junk. The top two buttons (1 and 6) are now free-floating. I can push them and there is very little resistance and no click of the buttons locking in place. Needless to say, I am now locked out of my key-box. Guess I'll find out just how secure it is as I bust it open to get my keys."
3,"Great idea, but needs a little more","As one of the previous reviewers noted, the locking mechanism broke - it was within 2 months of use for us which was disappointing. The keys were locked in and my husband opened the box with a hammer and a screwdriver (which ended up being surprisingly simple to do). He took it apart and found that the gear chamber was very thin and had worn out! But on the plus side, it was great having all of the keys in one place and it was very easy to use."
2,"Great idea, poor quality parts","I bought this unit as I wanted to stay away from the electronic units. For the first 4 months of use, it was great. But then the keypad ""broke"". It appeared one of the numbers was always ""pushed"". Luckily it was part of my code, so I could get into the safe.After taking the keypad apart, here is what happened. There is a flat plastic piece, similar to a tree branch. Solid down the middle and little ""branches"" that go in between the push buttons. The top broke off, so the number 1 and number 6 are eternally in their ""what it was when it broke"" position.Since this seems to be a quality issue (if I get a replacement safe, I would assume the new one would break in the same place)...I have to give it a low rating."
2,Touch pad broke - less than a year old,The touch pad lock broke with less than a year of infrequent use on it and all my keys were locked inside of it. In desperation I took a large screwdriver to it and pried the door open. It is not as secure as I had hoped and not as reliable as I expected. I have ordered a Buddy Electric Key Safe Cabinet (BDY322132) as a replacement.
3,"ok, not great","it is difficult to open and close, not of high quality, but seems to do the job, I am a real estate agent and needed a place in my office to keep extra keys. I got what I paid for."
5,Love This!,"I love this keyless entry system. It workes really well for our needs. We keep keys in here that aren't used a lot - keys to relative's homes, spare house key, etc. We even bought a 2nd one for my mom's place. I love that we don't keys all over the house or in a pile in the basket. It's great to not need a key to get keys. Combo is easy to change when you want and it holds a decent amount of keys. One thing to keep it mind however is the depth - it's fine for us, but if you have lots of 'stuff' on your key ring then it's hard to close the door."
4,Good for organization and keeping honest people honest,"Good quality, heavier then I thought. I like being able to keep my keys organized. I wanted a pushbutton so I didn't have to worry about another key to open up the lock for the keys!! Easy to install and set the combination. I don't like that the order of the combination makes no difference. I get into the box once or twice a week, sometimes with dirty hands. This leaves 'signs' of which keys I hit. Since the order doesn't matter all a thief would need to do is hit all the keys that are dirty or warn. Also, unless they are 30 individual keys on each hook I don't see how this will fit 30 keys. My spare car keys have the remote door openers on them (like most car keys do). These will only fit on certain hooks that aren't close to the internal mechanisms."
2,There are better options out there,"I was planning to buy this item, but was scared away by the reports of the locking mechanism breaking. I found a much beefier alternative (9 gauge steel) sold by Harbor Freight (model 95041 - ""Electric Key Box"") which has a battery-powered electronic keypad and an external key backup, all for about half the price of the GE. I had trouble finding this item on Harbor Freight's website, but it was in stock at their store. I am happy with it so far."
2,"If you're looking for security, don't buy it.","If you're looking for security, forget it. Stick a pry bar in the side and it's open in a matter of minutes. But, this is the option that most people have. However, I just found the Buddy Electric Key Safe Cabinet model 3221-32 that's a bit more expensive, but definately secure. It's built like a safe... a necessity to protect your keys from a determined theif. It's equipped with two bar locks instead of a tiny metal latch. Plus the hinges are concealed. I found the best price on Sam's club website, but it ranged from $100-$200 when I googled it. This GE type of key cabinet built with a metal latch is nothing better than a heavy duty storage cabinet for your keys. I wanted security and storage. Bought the Buddy Key Safe instead. Much happier."
1,Broke within 5 months!,I'm really upset! My key cabinet has broken!! The black knob that you turn to open and close the door completely stopped working. It doesn't latch anymore! I wish there were some sort of warranty on this product because it broke within 5 months of owning it. And it wasn't cheap! I might try to contact GE. But I am sure I will just have to toss it. Although I should recycle it. I wonder if there is a place to recycle such a heavy object. Good luck with yours! I hope it doesn't break on u! :(
2,not bad for $30,"The box is good, but the lock is junk. The first lock failed within 2 weeks. Amazon replaced it for me and it broke again about a year later. I opened both locks after they broke and they both broke in the same spot. The whole inside of the lock is plastic and breaks easily. I like the idea of having all the keys in one location and semi safe (yes I broke into mine with a screw driver and hammer also to get my keys out when it broke). I was going to repace the lock again, but the lock cost more than the whole box, so now I'm looking for something different."
4,Multiple Key Safe / Lockbox,"The key cabinet offers SOLID security for all your keys and a must-have to prevent others from access to your personal property. Locking all keys in the cabinet eventually becomes a good habit and provides you peace of mind, knowing no one can take the keys to your car, entry doors, office, etc. This cabinet is very simple to open and close, such that it becomes a daily routine requiring very little thought. I purchased one for my home and recently installed another for a lady who lives by herself."
3,ge key safe,I am pretty satisfied with the ge accesspoint 30-key cabinet. I mainly wanted it to store keys (such as car keys) that my teenage sons can't get at. I don't care much for the feel of the push-buttons or how the knob can still be turned without punching in a code but it doesn't let you open the door without the code. It works well for my purpose.
2,Poor quality control,"I tried to order this product twice and each time it came with dead pixels. I am very disappointed. I gave up on this product and am looking for something else. Picture quality would have been fine. Do note that the contrast ratio is 450:1 so the color isn't as vibrant as your monitor. However, I believe that it is customary in the digital frame market."
2,Keep Searching,"This picture frame is quite large and boasts 1024 x 768 resolution. However in terms of picture quality the much smaller Phillips 8"", which I had previously purchased, is far superior. Specifically, the contrast ratio, the color and the resolution of the CTA MI-PF15 are all very poor in comparison to the Phillips.One of the features that this screen offers that the Phillips does not is the ability to play music and movies. However, when attempting to play a simple movie recorded with a Canon Powershot camera, this device failed.In addition, CTA MI-PF15 that we purchased has a very obvious 'stuck pixel' right near the center of the display area.In conclusion, for your money, you can find much better picture quality. The extra size of this frame does not make up for the poor picture quality."
1,Buy from a reputable manufacturer!!!!,"We bought this item for our elderly parents last Christmas, and were initially very happy with our purchase. In August, it stopped working completely; we called CTA and they said it would be fixed under warranty and gave us a RMA number. We returned it in September; it is now November and we have heard NOTHING - they don't respond to EMAILs, and no one answers their phone. So this is just money flushed down the toilet. Find a more reputable manufacturer, DON'T get stuck with this one!"
3,"Okay, but not as good as Sheehan's","The video quality on the one I bought was perfectly good, BUT: Bear in mind that this is a Sybervision tape, which means there is no narration. Literally not a word is spoken. You simply watch Geiberger hit a bunch of drivers, a bunch of 5-irons, etc., to a music track. It is the same swing over and over, the idea being to program your muscle memory. This is Al's swing of many years ago. Even as a low-handicap male, I found the Sybervision tape with Patty Sheehan to be far superior. For one thing, her swing is simply better -- Al's swing is very smooth and his tempo is wonderful, but Patty's swing is technically flawless. In addition, some of the camera angles in this one are distracting -- on trap shots, the ball looks like it's two feet above Al's head. The two tapes do make a good set -- but if I was going to buy only one, I'd buy Sheehan's."
2,Poor Quality,"This video is obviously a reprint of the original SyberVision video. While the content is helpful in viewing the smooth swing of Al Geiberger, the quality of the video is very poor. It is very washed out and is not crisp. I was extremely disappointed with this quality, especially after comparing this tape against the original version."
2,The sub plots are growing old,"I generally enjoy W E B Griffin's books, but the characters and sub plots are growing thin. I'm beginning to think that only the the rich and politically well connected truly contributed to the war effort. Or perhaps that the rich have this special ability to know when they can casually break security without adverse consequences. The sub plots are getting hoaky!"
2,Poor showing from a good writer,"I normally like war time novels. I have read every one of W.E.B. Griffin's books, some several times. The Men at War series was originally written under his pen name Alec Baldwin, and came before all of his other series. This sequel to those two books is a poor follow-up to the first two. I felt the author was just going through the motions to make another buck after the re-release of the first two books in this series ( under his real name this time). Mr. Griffin, don't take this personally, but you can do a lot better."
2,Another W.E.B. Griffin rerun.,"I sometimes wonder if Griffin ever develops a new character or a new story line. After reading about 20 of his books everything seems like a tired re-run. It is a wonder we ever won the war with the amount of time that these ""super-egos"" spend at war."
1,A Re-run of 1986 issue.,Had anticipated a continuing of Corps series. The description did not iondicate that this was a reprint from the past. It is being returned today.
3,"Nice story, but hard to follow up","Story is nice, a good second world war novel.But I found it hard to follow on details, specially around the characters and parallel stories. Several new characts will appear in the story, not really cntributing to the development, but having me go back again and again on the pages, to understand who was who.Also, used several military terms in German, which shows good knowledge from the autor, but for a reader, its much easier to remember some one as leutanent muller, than franhouvermansonfullheer muller."
3,Not that good,"I ordered this one along with the new WWII novel The Triumph and the Glory, and found it rather weak compared to Griffin's past books. He seemed to just be going through the motions with The Soldier Spies, and has strayed from his strengths by getting into covert ops and stuff. The Triumph and the Glory was GREAT!"
3,Don't Read The Book Before You Watch This Movie,"I made the mistake of reading the book before watching this movie. I believe I am one of Maya Angelou's biggest fans; however, this movie failed to touch the main ""senses"" of her writing."
4,Uplifting Drama of young people growing up,"Have never memorized a poem, but her brother could.When Oliver asks for ""more"" our hearts are with him.Maya Angelou says that they deserve more.Her autobiographical description of being raped as a young girl and herrecovery is inspiring. I don't think a black class war on all white establishment efforts is right either.I believe from my own experience that blacks do deserve more.The black heritage is important to our culture.It is by the vitality of the parts of our society that weare served and serve. If you don't allow people fulfill their abilities their potentialis wasted for all."
4,Moderate Increase in Testosterone,"I have noticed a moderate increase in testosterone after two weeks, and taking one tablet per 45kg of body weight in the first week."
1,Doesn't work for me.,"I don't HATE it. But it is not worth it to me to buy additional bottles. I will take the supplements until they are gone, yet I do not notice any improvement in my body. Some prior reviewers attested to its help with arthritis; I didn't notice it. The buyers need to have realistic expectations of what the product may do for them."
5,Source Naturals product,"Twenty years ago I used a French Maritine pine bark product. Source Naturals from Scotts Valley, CA is one of the finest for quality food supplement companys. Here is one of their versions of French Maritine pine bark."
2,Expensive...,Not sure about this one. There is some body of evidence that it is a killer anti oxidant. It is pretty expensive for the little you get and cannot really couch for noticeable changes in any blood work as a result. After two months I opted out of adding this to my vitamin regime.
5,Twenty Years In The Making....And Worth The Wait,"Every now and then I find myself lucky enough to stumble across an historical novel so well-written that it seems to transport me back through the centuries and enables one to fully imagine what it was like to live and love in such a time. ""Flambard's Confession"" is such a book; a long, constantly evolving, ever interesting read which rivals ""The Autobiography of Henry VIII"" and ""Pillars of the Earth"" for the title of my all-time favorite novel.Truly one of those rare stories you wish would never end. How curious that the author never followed up this magnificent achievement with another book. But, then again, perhaps she was wise enough to realize that this effort could not be surpassed. I'd give it six stars if possible!"
1,Let the dead stay dead,One of the best books I ever read was A Stone for Danny Fisher by Harold Robbins. Great characters and a great story. I think I've read that book 5 times over the years.The Secret - should have been kept a secret. No plot - no story except sex. Characterization not too shabby - but nothing extraordinaryLeave Harold Robbins alone. These are notes that someone embellished and is trying to characterize as Robbins'. Let the dead stay dead.
1,Disappointing,"Before I picked up this book I knew that it was written by a ghost writer, posthumously. But since it was a ""sequel"" I wanted to get it anyway. What a waste of time! It is obvious that Harold Robbins had jotted down some notes and ideas and someone with no talent whatsoever had tried to make it into a novel. It is fairly clear to distinguish some of the passages that are Robbins' and then there are those that he would be ashamed to even look at. There is actually a part where the same sentence is repeated, with two words changed, on the next page. The intensity of characters, the eroticism, the storytelling that are so evident in most of Robbins' work is nowhere to be found in The Secret."
1,Missed The Boat!!!!,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I kept waiting for something to happen besides ""scanties"", than technology came into play, but the storyline was so boring and nothing worth reading about happened."
2,Repetative,"This is the first book I can remember reading by this author so perhaps he's a better author than this book leads me to believe. I became interested right from the beginning and found him to be a good storyteller but mid-way through the book, I became disapointed with the repetition. Too much talk about women in their scanties. The ending left very much to be desired. In short, came out of the gates well but had no stamina."
2,"MONK wants better script writers - survival request - ""please"" respond ASAP !!!!","Monk has already started to loose its attraction and charms. Compared to other Monk seasons, this 5th season is ""the Boring"" season. The main characters are too annoying where they are supposed to be funny and little bit intelligent - also there is a significant drop in the quality in script writing!!! Looks like they need to hire a bunch of creative writers. With few more seasons with this kind of quality, will surely drive away all of the Monk fans.Selling price of this product should be something like below $10 with free shipping!! So unless the price drops to that level, just sit tight or rent it from the local public libraries. They charge logically - 0.50 cents for the whole season!!"
1,DID NOT RECEIVE PRODUCT,Sent three emails notifying supplier that I did not receive product after period ended. No response from supplier and no product! Be cautious with seller. You might not receive product as promised.
2,disappointing,this series was is appointing in many ways. I bought it because it was so many minutes of my favorite series but it was not worth the money. It had a repeated episode (Monk meets the Lepord). It was not even that good of a story. They wanted to show it in black and white and color what a waste. There was not that many episodes. The only saving factor was the Psyco bonus episode. In conclusion it is not worth the effort to buy or watch. I hope season 6 is better.
1,Not pleased at all...,The product was totally squashed when I got it. I'm very disappointed and can't afford to send it back.
2,disappointed,"I think this series has lost its way, he is not like able any more the plots are well not interesting and monk is monk but has lost his charm and everyone is struggling to make boring scripts work."
1,Today's Review: Run Amonk,"This TV series is just a huge rip off of the Bill Murry classic What about Bob as it too stars a man that is afraid of germs and is obsessed with cleanliness. The name is also misleading...I thought it would be about Buddhist Monk that solves crimes so needless to say I was let down.Stick with the original What about Bob if you like germ-based humor. If you're looking for Monk-based humor, good luck. I still haven't found any comedies about monks. I'll keep on trying though."
2,Losing Interest Fast....,I bought this but to be honest I don't know why as the series isn't what it used to be.
5,Outstanding Humor!!!,Two of my favorite episodes are on this DVD: Monk at the hospital is hilarious as his excessive worry is exaggerated to a comical level. Mr Monk and the really really dead guy is really cute to see how Monk pits his brains against high technology and wins. It almost seems as a parody of the type of James Bond gadget miracles which seem insurmountable for Monk to even have a minimal chance of challenging. And it is great to see the pompous know it alls stopped dead in their tracks by Monk.
4,More Monk,"It is tempting to think Monk's phobic behavior is getting tiresome at this point (5 seasons) but Monk is still funny and yet somehow we are always sad for him in the end. He makes us laugh out loud, yet it is sad to watch him deal with his handicap and his past."
4,Monk,Monk - Season FiveI love Monk. I have watched him on TV whenerver I can from the first. I love the way he does the Sherlock Holmes style of detecting. It is all so logical and carefully studied as opposed to agressive cop style detective work.I would like to see him get cured of most of his phobias and get back on the force as a real detective. Sometimes the silliness of his phobias overpowers the detecting part of the plays. Maybe he could get mostly cured and get on the force and still be a little strange.
3,Monk,"I really love Monk, but this was not his best season. Some of the shows were funny, but the majority I did not care for."
5,monk by the episode,"I never knew I could buy the episode only and watch it...fell asleep during the TV viewing and was online looking to buy the season. Simply selected the episode, watched it, and now I know how it ends! Most of the episodes in that season I've already seen, so this was a nice option for me."
5,Monk-Season Five Review,"This product was accurately described. It arrived in a timely manner. I am very satisfied with this product. If you are a Monk fan, you will enjoy this season."
2,Less sophisticated than before. Poorer scripts.,"The first four seasons were TERRIFIC overall, but only a few of Season 5's episodes measure up to that standard. The plots are predominantly less complex and less interesting, and some of the characters are more annoying than funny. Do they have a new writer? Please bring back the old one!By all means, buy Season 1 through 4, but think twice about 5, or at least wait for a super discount.Unfortunately, the opening episode of Season 6 shows no sign of a comeback."
5,great,"Great price on product we use all the time, thought it would be cheaply made but second copy is good"
5,Brilliant!,"Louis Armstrong and his ""Hot Five and Seven"" are just brilliant! I resisted buying this set of CDs for years because I felt the quality of music recorded in the 20s was very low. Of course, a jazz collection without these recordings is like the Sistine Chapel without Michelangelo's frescos. JSP Records did a marvelous job of digitally remastering these inspired recordings...no scratching or popping and very little hissing. I can add little to what has already been said about these very reasonably priced discs."
5,re Jeff Jones comment and 1 star regarding this box,"So the reviewer Jeff Jones, who works for Columbia/Legacy is complaining that this is a bootleg. He should be careful about dissing another product when his own is so slipshod. I bought the Columbia/Legacy ""box"" and in no time the discs became damaged and unplayable. My email into Sony/Columbia regarding the problem was unanswered. $50 down the drain. Do yourself a favor and buy this one. It does lack Phil Schapp, but tune in on July 4th and hear his Pop's birthday broadcast and you'll get all you need."
4,Louie Armstrong - Hot 5s and 7s,"An excellent collection of the genre. Makes good listening for anyone who like early Armstrong or trad jazz generally. Well worth buying,"
3,"absolutely great music, but poor sound quality","These four records contains some of the greatest music of all times.Some of the most definitive jazz music ever recorded.So,why only three stars ??? When I was a child,some 25 years ago, my father owned the french CBS reissues of these sessions, on LP, of course; and the sound quality was much greater than on this slow price issue. If you really want to purchase Louis Armstrong's complete Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings, and I sincerely hope you will, please spend a few more bucks and buy the same four cd-set on Columbia; you'll be amazed by the quality of the sound ( it seems like the all band is playing before you ). The price of this set is very attractive,but you'll be seriously disappointed listening to it.The Columbia reissue is a superlative one,and it offers you a magnificent booklet with plenty of rare photographs, and great reading. Forget this one."
3,Great music-too bad so much sound has been lost,"The music is absolutely wonderful. Remember, though, that we are talking 1920s recordings. They are not going to sound as wonderful as you might hope for. This is not to say that they are not worth owning, but don't buy them with unrealistic expectations about the sound quality possible."
2,One out of four have Louie's voice,Three of the four CD's have very little vocals on them. One of the four CD's is worth the price because Louis sings on it often. I like his voice as well as his magnificent horn.
5,Classic jazz recordings,"This boxed set of these classic recordings is definitely the way to obtain these recordings for the sound quality, which the late John R.T. Davies did a great job with the remastering of these recordings from 1926-1929 by leaving a little noise instead of using noise reduction processes, plus it is at a decent price that makes it worthwhile to pick up. There are liner notes for each individual disc instead of a book so that you can get information on the specific period covered instead of the lavish book that many boxed sets do feature. These are essential recordings so buy this set as soon as possible and forego the lavish packaging that the Columbia set features and it is priced at half the cost of the Columbia set as well."
5,Like opening the door to a beautiful room you've never seen,Finding out about this music has been a revelation. What unbelieveable music. I'm no expert but considering when and how this music was recorded it sounds pretty amazing. Rock on Mr.Armstrong.
2,Cheap,"I purchased this to use with my black giant little giant ladder that I got stuck with because when I purchased it as a gift, it came in and looked used, anyway, when I was using it, it bent when it slammed against the house."
5,Can paint in more places,we are painting a rental house to get it ready for sale. This is a great tool both for helping to stablize the ladder but also for allowing a greater capacity to paint around the ladder itself. It allows you to reach places that if the ladder was against the house you would not be able to reach.
5,Simplest and Easiest ever,"It install easy and unistalls justr as easy making it a brezze to store my little giant in the basement. Very light and uncomplicated, unlike many other which cost even more."
5,"""NUTS!""","...That's what I was calling myself for buying their CD when, since I've had most of the songs on mp3's for more than a year now. But they're so good, I felt guilty not having paid for it, so I did. AND NOW I DON'T REGRET IT; THEY SOUND GREAT IN MY CAR!"
3,I LIKE IT,I have downloaded the one song San Deigo and i like what i hear. The song has that jazzy flow to it and the rapping is tight.
4,Husband very satisfied!,I bought this kit for my husband for Christmas who wanted to learn to juggle. When I first received it I thought this is all I get for 50 bucks but went ahead and wrapped it. My husband was thrilled with it on Christmas and has since been learning to juggle. He likes how it's written and the detailed instructions. So what do I know. If you want to learn to juggle this could be the kit for you.
3,Make sure your purchase includes balls,"Book seems well written, but twice I bought the item and it came in the mail with just the book. The picture shows it comes with balls, which it should, but some reason people send book without them. The book refers to the balls in first chapter even."
2,Run of the mill,"Nothing special,sounds like any other guy with a guitar and average voice playing at some local tavern in Anytown USA."
4,the golden age of rock,"This is an excellent compilation. Tracks from the usual suspects like Wire, Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, and X-Ray Spex are supplemented by excellent tracks I had not heard by the likes of The Adverts and The Saints, plus others.The energy, freshness, and vitality of the music really comes through this mix.I wish they could have included The Clash in this compilation... it seems like they very much belonged but could not be included for legal reasons.I had preferred the work of New York punksters from the same era, i.e. Talking Heads, Television, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, etc. But this compilation has turned me on to some other bands from the U.K.; I just might end up liking the British Punk better.ken32"
2,A terrible disappointment from talented people,"This was a real disappointment from the minute that I put it into the DVD player. It's just not funny. In fact, two of the skits were even pretty serious. This show is a waste of time and money, even though it has a talented cast. I do not know what went wrong, but something surely did."
3,Not threes company,"purchased this DVD for my wife after watching the entire Three's Company series. the DVD was good quality, but neither of us unjoyed the subject matter. I can see why this program did not take off."
3,Slightly better than average,John Ritter died way to young at 54&I still can't believe He is gone. now as far as this Dvd:there are moments of John Ritter's depth as a Comedian but this special is hit&Miss.I dig Ritter's Films&Of course Him on Three's Company.
4,rare groove,"If you are into funky jazz then this album is a must. It stands well along side Roy Ayers and Donald Byrds mid-seventies material. It sits pretty firmly in R&B territory, with most tracks having vocals. The tracks are pretty varied in an R&B kind of way balancing up beat funk work-outs with slower ballad tracks. For me Harris' funky synth work featured on most tracks is what makes this album stand out. While it's a very good album I feel the arrangements are a little too typical of the times to warrent classic status, so I'm only giving it 4 stars. If you are a jazz purist, then stay away. A must have for funksters."
2,Sci-Fi for Commodities Broker,The book starts out ok about Chavez Blackstone who is forced into indentureship to kill and skin dragons for their hide by the rulling elite. Then it departs into some subplots about a ship captain of the startship Flute and corporate trading of an alternate synthetic fabric better then dragon skins. These subplots never really merge with the Blackstone plot which only makes up about half the book and ends up just being a confusing mess. One chapter your reading about Blackstone then the next chapter in flips back to the commodites trading.
4,Great Book for a broad look at 12- Step Recovery,"Has a wide perspective on the 12-step program which had led millions of hopeless addicts, alcoholics, anorexics, bulimics, compulsive overeaters, in to recovery. Inspiring."
3,Wide open door,The book came at a good price and in good condition. We selected this as a book for a book club discussion. We did not finish the book. The author pontificates and makes it hard to relate to.
4,Los Lobos outrocks rock bands,"i have come to think of Los Lobos as a sophisticated band with a long history of intricate songs, ballads and mexican influenced folk songs. Live at the Fillmore simply rocks. It makes me wonder why this band has not been featured on radio stations across the country, why they are not celibrated by young people who are trying desperately to find a band that can rock, why groups such as U2 and 70's rock dominate the airwaves, even though this band can rock their socks off?The second cd is a throwaway of acoustic remakes of old Mexican stuff, and is way too short, but if you want to hear a greatest hits of hard guitar rock, take a listen to the first disc. And then answer the questions above."
2,very disappointing,"I have loved Los Lobos from the beginning; I truly believe they are one of the great bands of all time, full of creative energy. This cd is sloppy, sounds terrible and the playing isn't very inspired. Only on ""The Neighborhood"" do things start to stretch out and heat up. It's a real shame. . . ."
5,Maria is the best,"Maria Sharapova is in my book the best female tennis player in the world. I loved watching her play at Wimbledon. She looked like she had alot of fun playing at Wimbledon. And when she won, that was the best moment of my life when serena hit the ball into the net and Maria fell to the ground in excitement and then went to hug her dad. So this DVD will be awesome because you can relive one of the best moments of Maria's live and you can tell and show your kids this DVD and then they will show there kids and so on. All in all, I love Maria and she is going to be around for a very very long time.Love You Maria"
3,Good viewing,"I loved the women's final . As for Ms Sharapova being the best thing to hit tennis, lets talk about that after she wins she second grand slam , remember Michel Chang? I think her greatest attraction is not being a Williams sister."
4,Does what it's supposed to...,"Being new to web development, I would love to buy *one* book that would answer all of my questions and show me a step-by-step on every conceivable technique possible with DreamWeaver 2. This book doesn't do that, nor does it claim to. But it is an excellent reference for DW2 and Lowery is a very, very good technical author. On every occasion that I have consulted this book, I have found the answer I needed, or a reference to where I might find it. Only minor drawback was that I felt the CD-companion could have been beefed-up with more tutorials and examples."
3,Read the manual that Dreamweaver comes with first.,"Well I suppose this book has everything, but don't think you're going to read it from start to finish. It's 1,034 pages long! If you're new to Dreamweaver and you just want to get started as quickly as possible, you might want to do as I did and just read the manual that came with the software first. So, to be fair I've not read more than the first 100 pages. Maybe on the second attempt I'll be more into it."
2,dreamweaver 2 bible,I wish everyone would be honest when reviewing books.If your new to web design this is not the book.Go for something more general.It takes a lot for granted.It's ok for understanding bits of dreamweaver ONLY.But it's not organised in a constructive manor.Information appears to be thrown at you.
5,great book (but I have not realy read it),"you now, I wanted to buy this I have read all the good thing said about this book. I realize anyone can write a compliment. the author can write A THOUSAND compliment a day to promote his or her book. I hope Amazon would have some savegauds."
3,"Good start, but has a way to go.","Good book for fundamentals such as style sheets and basic coding; however, the book leaves out a very good portion on one of the main reason a web developer would want to use dreamweaver, the templates function. I find this section of the book to be more of a joke than a section. Moreover, its lack of description on how to link template files to the site manager leaves much to be desired.All in all, if you are a beginner to dreamweaver and web publishing, it wouldnt hurt to have the book on your desk. Just know that if you wish to do more of the complex things such as running your site off templates, you are in store for headache or two."
5,Very good in-depth information and understandable wrinting,"This book did a great job for after studying the standard documentation that comes from Macromedia. It is a must to have in the library for every serious web developer either to learn the details or to have a reference book for all the questions that arise during the design of a site. It was the first of a whole series of ""bible"" books that I bought.This masterpiece cannot be worked thru in a day. It takes the time that you need to become a professinal from the very beginner's state...."
4,Good Good Good,"Well, this book says it all. A great companion for all ""Dreamers"". It is a good bet that you find everything you need in this book. Only one complain from me: could have been a little more about frames - the basics. But all in all; a wonderful achievement from Mr Lowery."
3,Ok overall,"This book's ok overall. Though, the app itself is updated to a new version so often that I don't really think that buying the new version of the book every time is required. I'm using DW4.x now and I still refer to the 2.0 book for many of the features."

3,Colorful,Colorful and interesting. Not a great scientific video but not shabby either. Makes some good points about the need to sustain the forest. My grandson watched it three times in one weekend.
1,franklin chef bad customer service,Item ordered from Franklin Chef July 17. Defective. Returned and guaranteed replacement if power cord sent to company. November 10 and no oven. 10 emails and 5 phone calls and always lies and no truth from company. No response after many attempts to get honest answer.
1,Poor quality and worse service,"This oven is such a good idea. However, Franklin Chef just didn't get it right. The oven won't hold a correct temperature. The fan sounds like a 747 taking off. Even worse, is their customer serivce. They have an automated attendant that replies ""due to a large number of calls, we'll call you back"". No return calls. This is customer service at its worst!!! I'll keep looking for a reliable convection oven. Meantime, this one goes back."
2,franklin chef convection oven,"i purchased this oven with high hopes, after my FARBERWARE gave out after FIFTEEN YEARS OF CONSTANT USE. i made the mistake of NOT returning it. I've had it for about a year and used it about once a week. The heating elements just stopped working, only the fan continued to make a loud noise. I cannot believe that they call it ""professional."" In addition, the customer service is the worst i have ever dealt with. will never again purchase this brand. unfortunately, most everything these days is made in China, the quality of products made in the USA is not there."
1,worst product on the market,I wanted to get away from the micro so I decided to get a convection oven and ofcourse had to order it from Target. I got the oven and was tickled at how well it baked but was not entirely even. It saw very little use and then just quit working all together. The unit is put together very cheaply and was too expensive to have this kind of service out of it. It is made in China so beware this was not available to me when I ordered it or I would not have done so. Why cant we buy good items that are made in the good ole USA. This oven is nothing but junk
4,Son loves them,Got these for my 2 1/2 year old son to play with in the sandbox and he loves them. The squirty toy has been the biggest hit by far in the tub and pool. Truck is kinda small but he likes it anyway. I love the colors.
1,Not pleased with this product,"My daughter loves ballet (never taken classes). This video was not helpful at all. I thought it would be utter success, but it's awful. The instructor (unseen) only sings instructions which are unclear and sound terrible."
4,Video helpful to my 4-7 year old,"I have used this video for nearly two years, requiring practice twice a week. I have seen great progress with my daughter, although I did it with her the first six-12 months until I saw that she had the technique down correctly. The only problem I have seen with the video and her regular dance class, is that sometimes at class, her teacher will teach the step a little differently, and this will make my daughter feel that it is not the same step. However, since she is now the best dancer in her class (according to her teacher) I do feel that the video has really given her the edge. My daughters thoughts on the video? She liked it best when mom practiced with her. She is sometimes likely to be lazy in practice when doing it alone. She is now ready to move on to something more difficult. She has just completed her 3rd year in ballet."
4,Thorough,"This is a very thorough review on beginning ballet. My daughter loves watching both the little girls and adults perform. I just wish they gave more time for each segment, but then again, this video covers so much that the video might be too long in the end. The singing is nice too because now my daughter can memorize the rules having the song in her head. I just don't like that there's much of a break in the singing, which can prove to be annoying for the adult ears."
3,dissappointing,"This book has great pictures of fashion illustrations and is helpful because it gives instructions for 3 different CAD platforms, but as far as giving explicite directions on ""how to"", I found it lacking in substance. It seems that the really great stuff in the book was still hand drawn,scanned in and manipulated a bit with Photoshop. If you are absolutely brand new to these programs and need help gettting started it might help you. For me, it will be more of a pretty book to look at once in a while rather than a reference for problem solving."
1,worst book for fashion design using photoshop,This book was a huge disappointment. I am so lucky I purchased a different book to teach me Illustrator (Creative Fashion Design with Illustrator by Kevin Tallon). Tallons book actually has extensive step by step tutorials where Sandra Burke simply skims over her exercises.Many of her exercises don't even work corrently. One could never master Photoshop or Illustrator using this book.
5,It's a great book.,"I've skimmed through the book and it looks great.There are many images and explanations are detailed.For beginner in illustrator and photoshop, this book is really recommended."
5,My 3 yr old loves Wubzy!,"Another great Wubzy movie to add to my sons collection! I would definitely recommend this movie, its a super cute and a fun movie!"
5,SIZZLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Action, intrigue and lust will keep you turning pages in Shayla V. McClellon's book HYPNOTIC. Feel free to blush as you read and feel the heat. McClellon is the author to watch for future sizzlers.Jade Alex, Author of EVIL AMONG THE SAINTS(Novel available in June, 2006)"
5,"Excellent, ergonomic, well made","This hammer is top quality. The best I've tried.It has an ergonomic handle that comfortably supports a variety of holding positions (up close to the head, down at the bottom, in between).The handle is attached to the head with a traditional wedge construction that should significantly outlast the other cheaper hammers."
4,It Works,"No Problems==I tried this on an older computor that I was getting rid of!I will use it on another, when I get a chance!"
5,Should be standard equipment with Nikon Coolipx 950,"Like the previous reviewer, I also purchased the Kodak NiMh batteries and charger and have found it to be a much-needed improvement to the standard package. Too bad Nikon doesn't include this as standard equipment with its digital cameras. My wish list: an automotible cigarette-lighter adapter so I can recharge batteries ""on the fly"". Overall, a quality product that functions as advertised and provides good value for the money."
3,Too pricey,"For a slightly less price, you can get yourself a negative pulse charger. A negative pulse charger strips away sulfate buildup and gas bubbles that basically ruins any rechargable batteries.Take a look at the Maha C210 charger or Radio Shack cat 23-422 pulse charger. They're microprocessor controlled so that you can't overcharge your batteries. With the C210 you can charge any type of battery ranging from 3V to 12V."
4,Light!,"It's a great charger. You can basically bring it to anywhere you go. But one advice, don't buy too many batteries, because most of the time you think that you really need a lot of batteries, but after you really bought a lot of batteries, you will realize that you don't need that much! And regret about wasting money. And if you are out of battery, you can just charge them again, two hours after, they are full charged."
3,Kept me til the end!,"I had a very good experience with the purchasing of this movie. Film was packaged neatly and shipped swiftly. Undue Influence was a great movie, packed full of Suspense at every turn. And you will love the ending! There was an unexpected twist. Would recommend this film to everyone I know."
1,morons strike again,I wouldn't know if this film is any good or not because it is NOT closedcaptioned though the description says it is.
1,terrible!,"I still didnt receive my dvd, im trying to reach the seller, and i would like to have a refund!!!"
2,Needs improvement in quality,Positive= fits snug on scopeNegatives= opening mechinism is inconsistent and often requires you to put some serious force into it. Also the yellow button is able to fall out if pulled on or snagged rendering it useless in the field. Might want to consider a different style.
5,"A senstional combination of love, science, and religion","Resurrection Genome is a thoroughly fascinating novel, combining elements of today's leading edge scientific research with a scintilating love story. And this is all while providing interesting insight into the Morman religion which serves as a thoughtful backdrop to plot line. This is a novel you will not want to put down, with sparkling dialog and a compelling theme. Rivals Patricia Cornwell novels, but without the bloodletting. Highly recommeded !!!"
4,really good product,"I love this blanket, but I wish it came in a larger size too. It does help baby sleep longer, and that is really great! I would recommend this blanket to everyone with a newborn."
5,Miracle Blanket,Great quality blanket from consumer friendly supplier that makes swaddling so much easier because the baby does not wiggle out.
2,Sucky Blanket,"My daughter always calms down at night when she's swaddled. The Miracle Blanket never seemed to contain her though. She's almost 12 lbs and 24 inches long. I'm not sure if she's too long, but she would constantly kick out of the foot pouch. We went back to a swaddler with velcro which ended up working much better for us. Not sure if it's a length issue or I just have a really 'kicky' baby, but I found the Miracle Blanket to be the Sucky Blanket."
2,OVERRATED,"I do not get this blanket at all. My child needs to be swaddled super-tight in order to sleep. We use the swaddlers with the velcro fastners pretty religiously because if he manages to squeeze out a hand or kick out a leg in his sleep, he will wake up crying. So he really has to be wrapped. This blanket in my opinion is overpriced and does not do a good job of keeping baby wrapped up. He managed to kick his feet out every single time we wrapped him in it. Maybe we are using it wrong but we can't see any other way to keep his legs inside. And it's kind of awkward having to wrap the top portion around the baby's torso. Overall, just not really worth the money. We are sticking with the swaddlers by Kiddopotamus."
2,Extreme Swaddling,"My baby loved being swaddled, but this blanket was another story. Every time we wrapped his little arms, he got very fussy. Additionally, our baby quickly grew too tall for the blanket. We ended up cutting off the foot pouch and just using the arms part for a little while. In the end, I think we'd have been better off continuing with the regular swaddling."
3,teaching fitness classes,"this is more of a question than a review- I have a Bose Portable sounddock. it has one aux input opening on the back and the iPod dock on the front.Does the Bose have the capability to play music from the iPod and project my voice via a wireless mic system connected to the Bose sounddock using an 1/8"" Aux - female XLR cable to connect the wirless mic receiver to the aux input on the bose."
1,Horrible Sound quality,"I was excited to use this item to connect a dynamic XLR microphone to my Zoom H1 Handy Portable Digital Recorder, so that I could record from afar using my portable recorder. However, much to my disappointment, when I was doing a sound check using this connection, there was a terrible loud buzzing noise created. I tested out various different configurations, and I couldn't come to any conclusion other than the fact that this connector was creating the problem.. I would not recommend this product at all."
2,its not something i would buy again,If i had to do over i would have never buy this item it does work but barely plus you will have to buy other things and adapter for it to work well enough for you to keep it and that will cost you another 20 or 30 dollars in my opinion it is not worth it. I have to use other cables and use it with my amp for me to hear the sound and stuff without that it is dead quit.
1,Not for semi pro use!,"I use my canon vixia hfr20 to film a web series. We shoot in HD and typically have good audio quality. The camera is new and I bought this to use with an external mic of high quality. All I get is a hum. So bad I may have to re-shoot and do ADR putting us behind schedule. If you touch it, it creates a hum. If you let it hang near the camera/tripod it creates a hum, we can lessen it by holding it up in the air (which is ridiculous) but in Final cut, the hum is always there. Don't buy this if you are using it for any pro quality project. I guess you get what you pay for... I bought a cheap audio technica lapel mic for $20 and it gives me better quality then using this adapter."
1,Did not work.,I have a canon t3i and a rode nt1-a mic. This product did not work for me. I had to send it back.
1,Adapter Cable,This cable was defective on arrival. Could not receive sound through this cable. Replaced this cable with another cable from another source which worked fine.
4,Works with Canon 7D,"I like filming with my Canon 7D, but unfortunately I do not own a beachtek DSLR XLR Adapter. So i bought this cheap M to XLR F which connects with my shotgun Microphone Azden SGM-1X. It works perfectly! You just have to make sure the plug doesnt get pulled from your camera. I saved myself a lot of money to get a professional audio for my videos!"
5,Cheap and high quality,"I needed to connect an XLR microphone to a 3.5mm stereo input jack, and this fit the bill perfectly. It's even capable of phantom power, if you need that. Totally recommend."
1,Horrible Quality!,Used this mic with the Azden SGM 1X plugged into a zoom h2 and the canon t2i. It cut the signal 20db to where it wasn't audible at all but kept the noise level the same. Went to Guitar Center to get an actual adapter that works fine.
1,Not working properly,I purchased this to connect an Azden SGM 1-X shotgun mic to a Canon T3i. The build quality seems good but my cable was defective. I wasn't able to record any sound even with the gain bumped way up. I swapped out a cable from a friend and the mic recorded just fine. I can't speak for how it sounds when it's working as I am just using the cable I got from my friend now. Amazon processed my refund very quickly though which was great.
1,Mr. and Mrs. flutes,The item was great quality but I did not receive the item in the picture. I was shipped Bride and Groom flutes instead so I had to return them.
5,Does the job,"I have speakers that would work best using an XLR (3 way) I/O, but my stereo only has typical 2 way rca phono jacks for speaker outputs. I took a chance buying these 2 way XLR to rca phono plug adapters and they worked fine. No regrets."
4,awesome book,I use this work order book for all my invoice needs. It has 3 copies and it works for my repair company.
5,Incredible and inspiring,Dwayne continues with an excellent series of uplifting stories and details about his personal life. This is an inspiration for all of us to be committed to a better life that we are all capable of achieving.
3,"Mr. Strickland, we are not pleased.","Hard-core Bellairs fans, take up your hardcover Dial copies of ""The House With a Clock in its Walls"" and BLUDGEON! BLUDGEON the atrocity that is this book! ...Maybe I'm overreacting just a smidge. Nixing the theatrics, this book is typical hackneyed Strickland-as-Bellairs fare.. you can tell that he's trying, and he DOES imitate the style well. However, he falls flat when injecting the gloomy Catholic undertone, and the entire Clabbernong-farm thing was lifted COMPLETELY from a much better Bellairs book, ""The Face in the Frost."" Also, the Lovecraftian bits are good but not great -- but I'm happy to see that Strickland can get as gruesome as Bellairs could. The villains were more obnoxious than terrifying, and woefully underdeveloped. Yep. This was certainly a book, but I'm not buying it."
4,"Easy, but slow!","It's certainly faster than a serial port, but not as fast as I had hoped. It does have a few great benefits though. It's easy and it's portable. It does require a quick install of some software, but I just carry the floppy install in my camera bag. Just the thing for downloading images to some other computer."
3,Does what I expected,"I bought this to supplement my USB card reader when away from home,or when I loan my camera.I didn't expect it to be as fast...and it isn't.Still very portable and works well.Only one problem to report,it doesn't want to read from the media card(Olympus)that came with my camera.It will read just fine from all my Delkin cards.Can't comment on any other brand of card."
4,Can not use this product with my upgrade to XP.,"I had very good success using this product until I upgraded my PC to Windows XP. I now can not get drive A: to recognize that the FlashPath disk is inserted into drive A: What do I need to do to use the FlashPath Disk and continue to load my pictures from my camera to my PC?Please contact me at ...Thanks,Bill"
4,Great product -- an essential digital camera accessory,"My FlashPath came along with my Olympus D-400 camera. To transfer digital snapshots to a computer running the FlashPath software, simply pop the SmartMedia into the FlashPath device and then pop the FlashPath device right into your floppy drive. You can access digital photos just as you would work with any other file on a floppy. It's faster than using the cable and much easier. The only downside is that you must install special software on any computer that will read the floppy. This limits ease of use on multiple computers (e.g., when you're travelling), but it's no big deal if you use the same computer most of the time. Overall, a great product, and an essential, reasonably priced accessory for digital photographers."
5,A great book for beginner programmers,This book is perfect for beginner programmers. Or if you are moving into C++. It helps you understand all aspects of C
4,"Thorough, easy to use, but may be too slow for some","This is a great book for someone with no programming experience. Never heard of a ""for"" loop or an ""if"" statement? This book is for you. The book could very well be retitled ""Introduction to Computer Programming via C."" Perry explains in detail the initial stumbling blocks that prevent newcomers from understanding programming. The writing is very accessible.That said, people with experience coding in other languages will probably find the pace of the book too slow. For the chapters on control structures, you could probably just glance at the syntax and skip the rest. The book may be useful to you as a quick reference, but I'd recommend checking it out from the library for a couple weeks rather than buying it.Bottom line: I recommend this book over K&R; if you're new to programming, and especially if you're just getting set up with a compiler and text editor on your own machine. Perry does a better job than most at making coding less arcane."
5,Excellent for beginners with no previous experience,Perry knows how to clearly explain the C language and keep the readers interest. The chapters are concise and not overloaded. The language is very clear. The only problem is that he could have given a few mpre examples. Still deserves 5 stars for clarity.
2,"Good for quick read, but not the best","I read through this book twice, and although it provides some good examples for beginners, it does so in a very brief manner. Get this book if you are looking for a quick read (larger font, nice pictures, etc.).If you are looking to gain a better understanding of C, even if you are a beginniner (like myself), go out and get C Primer Plus, which is filled with tons of complete examples, challenge questions, and challenge programs."
5,ANY G.PERRY BOOK IS GOOD,"IF YOU NEED BOOKS THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND OR EVEN OVER UNDERSTAND, BUT LIKE IT THAT WAY, THIS BOOK AND TWO OTHERS THAT I HAVE OF HIS FOUND THERE WAY INTO MY SHELVES WHERE I NOW LEND THEM OUT TO ALL FRIENDS WANTING TO START SOMEWHERE IN THE PROGRAMMING FIELD A GOOD BUY!"
2,Extremely imprecise,"I am surprised that this book has gotten the good reviews that it has. This book's title should read ""ABSOLUTE! beginner's guide to C"". The book assumes that you not only have no knowledge of computers, but also assumes that you have no knowledge whatsoever. I found the bad puns and stupid jokes quite distracting and I don't recommend this book to anyone who wants to become a serious programmer. A couple of the references to functions are incorrect, and several of the snippets of code will not compile if thrown into a program. I'm very disappointed in this book and in the author and editor(s). Some of these mistakes would have been caught by a half-competent C programmer. I recommend reading ""The C Programming Language"" by Dennis Ritchie. If you don't want to walk away from a book with a smaller IQ then when you started, stay away from this book....."
3,good yet hard,a bit mundane and the non serious joking parts are a bit annoying. their attempt at humor is a little over the top
5,Amazing!,"Such a great book to beginner, easy to learn, easy to understand. The must to have !! !! ! !"
5,Great book!,"I had a little knowledge of Visual Bsic and didn't know anything about C programming. However, this book explained well enough to understand how to program in C. The examples are kept simple, and it's very easy to understand for everybody. If you don't know anything about programming or don't know where to start, this is the right book."
5,All the other reviews are right on! This book rocks!,"I'm only 13 and I'd never programmed before in my life! My dad got me this book to help me learn C and it's the best book ever.He has a lot of C manuals, but this book is waaay better than any of 'em. Believe me. I know."
4,Good for review as well,I'm a C++/Java programmer who needed a quick brush up on C.This book did the job for me!
5,BUY! BUY!! BUY!!!,"i started to learn C back in a college course, and it was very difficult. with this book, it made the material i learned more understable and easy. everything is broken down so even someone who isn't familiar with C at all can learn it with no trouble. i recommend this book to everyone."
3,This book is for teenagers,"You may buy this book if you are 10-15 yeras old (price is a bit high though for this type of book for your age) AND there is no one (parent, friend) around to explain what this is all about. You should not buy this book if you have any kind of higher education."
3,Well made and weakly written,"I knew C from long time ago, but needed to refresh my memory. So I went through this book and, telling the truth, I accieved my goals. I was able to easily skip through the chapters and find what i needed leaving behind what I already knew.But, I think if a real ""beginner"" gets onto it, there will be some difficulties learning from zero. Although, the very elementary thing were written well, book itself is a little bit boring and requires a bit of patience to finish it all.Again, easily skipped - rare for other books.Maxim Maletsky"
2,pretty weak... if you know any c at all don't buy this -- absolute beginner indeed,"this book is designed for the absolute beginner to learn some c, it covers basic programming concepts as well...if you know any c you don't need this at all"
2,This book shows how continuation-passing style,This book shows how continuation-passing style is used as an intermediate representation to perform optimizations and program transformations. Continuations can be used to compile most programming languages. The method is illustrated in a compiler for the programming language Standard ML.
4,Got me started with C,"I bought this book as a reading assignment from Harvard's Edx.org online class CS50x. This book is recommended reading for those ""less comfortable"" with programming. It helped me finish my first programming assignments."
4,Great intro into C programming,"I'm only about half way through this book so far it's been a great book to learn the basics of C programming. The author does a great job of breaking down the information into manageable chucks. I always seemed to get bogged down by other C books because of the great level of detail but this book gives the basic information required to get a 'handle' on C programming and from there, the reader can take it further if he/she chooses."
4,Outstanding documentary!,"There is a reason the man behind this incredible DVD was a consultant to Dan Brown, author of THE DA VINCI CODE. His documentary is overflowing with cutting-edge information varying from medieval symbolism to the intangible spiritual capacity of symbols. Sound boring? Trust me, it is not. You know how Steven Spielberg can take the most boring, mundane topics and spin unbelievably awesome films out of them? This documentary does just that, only with the mysterious world of symbols. Forget renting, just buy it!"
5,early large cents,"the copper cent output of the early philadelphia mint was severely hampered by dies of poor quality materials, a new die could break after just a few pieces were struck,the dies were repaired using parts from other dies, thus striking a new coin that differed slightly from the original piece,the original,in fact became a rare coin as only a few pieces were struck, even though it was possibly a common date! Dr Sheldon in his book Penny Whimsy,spent a lifetime cataloging each coin struck,and assigning a rarity number. An ideal research book for the large cent collector,you may have a rarity and not be aware of it!"
4,Big Penny Book,"The book is a detailed evaluation of the early large copper cents. I've begun collecting these and the book if of invaluable help in studing these ""Early American Coppers"" which they are referred to. I'm glad to have found a copy available and will continue to use this referrence tome."
4,Eco-friendly pays off,"Have you seen the liners for your cupboards...? It's VERY similar, but on a larger scale.Works a treat, though, and knowing it's eco-friendly really does put one's mind closer to ease."
2,From Cleveland but didn't like it,"I was sure this book would be a winner for me. I'm from Cleveland and love it and also have a soft spot for old houses.But this book was 'a miss' for me. First, there were too many times the author wandered off for pages and pages of monologues about the meaning of home, the literary aspects of home and while I am a college graduate, these bored me to no end.The history of Cleveland itself was interesting enough, if overlong. But the two biggest disappointments to me were the fact that almost none of the renovations were done by the homeowners, save painting and minor demolition. And the details of the renovations were not given.Secondly, from the very first page, almost, the author describes the house as 'creepy' and 'dark' and 'having a bad feeling'. They argue when inside, their daughter hates the place, and yet they STILL buy it. This made me loose respect for the author right off the bat.This book is bound for Goodwill, as I will never read it again."
5,Best book to read first to get the ball rolling for college.,"This book is excellent - it is simply put so that you can read, follow the tips and move on to the goal of getting started on the work to get to college ...... ggrreeaatt reference for parents and students ...... This book has been updated every year - that tells you something - it's the best book to read first to get the ball rolling for college."
3,"Good package, but does not merit title","This collection covers everything essential from the first four Iron Butterfly LPs. Although purists may bemoan the (perhaps necessary) inclusion of the single version of ""Inna-Gadda-Da-Vida"" instead of the 17-minute album version, this album includes just about every worthy track from that period. (Actually, the entire Iron Butterfly studio output from this period, including the seventeen-minute ""Vida"", could all fit on 2 CDs). I personally would have picked ""Slower Than Guns"" over ""Easy Rider"" from Metamorphosis, but hey. Rhino's packaging and track information is up to their usual standard. However, Rhino's neglect and refusal to ackowledge the two mid-seventies albums Scorching Beauty and Sun And Steel (the latter far and away the best album the band ever did) means that the collection cannot truly earn ""The Best Of"" moniker and must be docked points for incompleteness."
3,"Iron Butterfly defines ""heavy"" music","Iron Butterfly helped to define heavy music in the late sixties. Starting with the Iron Butterfly Theme, with its pondering organ, guitars soaring, then slashing, the sounds can sometimes be grating. But, isn't that what you want? The first half of the CD is wonderful, full of the Iron Butterfly sounds that you remember. Frankly, I very much prefer the long version of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. The single version is just missing too much for me. Including the original 17 minute song would have taken up too much space on the CD. However, they could have deleted the second half of the playlist and made an improvement. The ""Butterfly"" nature seemed to predominate in their later songs, making them pretty much forgetable. Enjoy the first half of the CD and play it loud!"
5,surprised,"What catches me off-guard with this show is that Shawn really could easily be snotty or bratty, especially in his interactions with Gus. Everything in his life goes right-- he can smooth-talk his way out of any situation, people like him, and besides his questionable psychic abilities, they think he's decent, and he's clever and witty. And yet none of this ever goes to his head. Instead, he approaches everything with charm and humor, and his excitement about cases and such reminds me of an 8-yr-old going to his first monster-truck rally.Shawn and Gus are so genuine that it really warms your heart to watch them. Their banter is funny, their friendship is real, and Shawn's sense of humor comes from left field sometimes, completely unexpected and hilarious.All in all, it's the most original show that I've seen, and I absolutely love it."
3,Not nuts about the nuts but,It has some entertainment value. There are so really funny moments. Main actor James Roday is the star and he deserves credit. Actor Dule hill is Roday's sidekick but he's way less relevant than Tonto was to the Lone Ranger. Try season 1 and then decide whether you want to move on to the next season or not.
5,Great Season,I was turned onto Psych by a co-worker of mine and it is one of the greatest comedy shows out right now. The Bromance between Shawn and Gus makes for good comedy. Please purchase and tell all of your friends.
5,Great Show,"This is a great show, good for a laugh. Bought it as a gift for my sis and we enjoyed watching the whole season!"
5,Good Clean Fun,"This show is something the whole family can watch. Funny, creative with wonderful dialogue. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
3,Extremely Disappointed,"I would give this album a five, but unfortunately, whoever remastered this, has butchered (as in chopped) the ends off of several songs (Interstellar Overdrive, Biding My Time and more, seconds I deem important), and the beginning of others (most noticeably Julia Dream). The remastering sounds flatter than my LP and tape of Relics (without the added tracks), and more hiss has been introduced to boot. I think this may be the worst ""remaster"" done. At least the worst I've heard. It really is a shame. Look to other/earlier releases for quality. Peace."
5,Excellent comprehensive course of training in Arabic Grammar,I used the 4 volume set during my studies years ago. I have intermittently studied Arabic and taught Arabic to American Muslim students over the past 15 years. I have yet to find an Arabic Grammar to match Kapliwatzky's at any price. My only complaint is that sometimes he gets TOO detailed.
2,Look at the date of the previous reviews,"This is an old book now in 2004. Besides, it should be clear somewhere that the examples are written in VB.Net and also that, by the time this book`s edition was released, version 1.1 of .Net Framework was not available since it was released in April 2003."
5,Excellent Book,The book reveals the complexity of the asp.NET technology in a very easy to read and comprehensive way. Excellent for people that prefer larning from examples - you will find asp.NET implementation for almost every problem that you may have as a web developer.Excellent daveloper's handbook!!!
2,This Book is not worth the money,"I bought this book as an avid 3D Designer. I use Lightwave, SoftImage, 3D Studio Max, and I have a degree in IDI. I found this book to be totally confusing, in the first few chapers they speak of walk throughs, but it never tells you when you're approaching tutorials so you become lost. I do not recommend this book to beginners or intermediate"
1,Terribly out of date,"I bought this book six years ago and was appalled to see a copy with a new cover in a bookshop around here containing the same materials I saw six years ago.And yes all those crappy plasticky textures which are the hallmark of a Bill Fleming 3D image is still there. After almost a decade not a single pixel changed.Pity the would-be digital artist who will be so naive as to fall into this trap of Fleming constantly reheating yesteryear's leftovers.This is the Digital Age. Use your search engine. There are newer, younger, more talented and savvy artists appearing on print every month."
5,No contest my favorite album ever,"Giddy and swooning as I write this with the knowledge my favorite album of all time is finally available on CD. Every song remarkable, her powerful voice, blah blah biddy blah just get it. In Central Park in 1976 or 77 I saw her perform, she launched into my favorite song ""Cyclone,"" and a fierce and sudden wind came upon us..."
1,disappointment,"I've never purchased a double album set that was so disappointing. I can't believe anyone would rate this blah, melodically awkward compilation more than 1 star. Almost tossed it in the trash when I finished listening to it. I hope the local used record shop will give me a couple $ for it."
5,beatlemania bust,"This is the perfect example of the problems of the 60's Beatlemania. I grew up in Chicago in the 60's and had the opportunity to see this group along with the Buckinghams and Cryan Shames at many a Battle Of The Bands,to me they were by far the best. Iam very dissapponted that this talented group never got the recognition they deserve. The ballads by this band are some of the best put together material you will ever find. I am sure the with the backing of let us say Columbia Records like their counterparts they would of had world wide status. I must admit this is a sore subject for me,to thinks of the garbage goups that came out of England in the 60's(hermans hermits etc.) I just wish they were bettr promoted and the Chicagoland deejays would of got a bigger kickback in those days. I am glad that we do have thiese great CD'S around to listen and enjoy."
5,WOW,"All that I can say is that I'm really glad that this medium doesn't wear out. I'd forgotten about all of the songs except my favorite ""Things I'd Like To Say"". Rhino has done a great job of bringing back the classic 60's music. The production is great. The mostly original music is right up there with the best. I'm a big fan of ballads, and the New Colony Six excelled at them. I remember listening to them on WLS-Chicago on my transistor radio which I could pick up easily AFTER SUNDOWN from near Cleveland where I grew up. An excellent choice for real 60's music lovers."
4,This one's a keeper (and is getting hard to find)!,"One of the many Chicago ""garage"" bands of the 1960's, the New Colony Six spread their brand of blue-eyed soul throughout the Midwest. Though probably not as well known as their fellow Chicagoans ""The Buckinghams"", or ""The Cryan Shames"", the New Colony Six ventured into the pop-rock venue with sometimes lush love ballads, complete with strings and violins and multi-part harmonies. This album is the definitive collection of their hits. Take a trip back through lover's lane with ""Can't You See Me Cry"" and ""Things I'd Like To Say""... and the many more gems on this CD!!!"
2,Emergency only,"To store in the back of your car or house somewhere, I think this would be good for an emergency. But the radio is so poorly made I would be afraid after using once or twice it would break. So I returned it."
5,This is the best i have found !!!,"This is the best i have found !!! Multi supplement ...I just order 2 more bottles from amazon the price here is the BEST i have found ,and you get 120 pills ,I got my first bottle from our local health food store and i paid $36.00 for 60 pills so this is a great deal...Me and my husband feel so much better taking this and we also found that were not snacking as much..and even better you only need to take 1 pill a day ..also i found that even my skin even looks and feels better..I do NOT want to ever be without it ..I hope this helps someone looking for a good Multi supplement vitaman.."
1,Book was published in 2005,"The Kindle date is 2011 but it is the same book that was published in 2005. I was a little disappointed, because this is 2012 and I don't want to read a 7 year old book to learn a programming language."
1,Pirated book,"Please don't buy this book. Editorial Pax produced this Spanish version without authorization from the publisher, Free Spirit Publishing.Por favor no compre este libro. Editorial Pax produjo esta versión española sin autorización del editor, Free Spirit Publishing."
5,Quality alternative.,"I have an 89 S4 and the coil leads that came with the wire set fits the Bosch 00055 coil. The Beru wire set comes with 4 coil leads which fits either the Bosch 00055 or the Bosch 00060 coil depending on which is original with the car. Mine used the 00055 originally but, the other coil was replaced by the previous owner with an 00060. Nice :) Typical with the 928 to have overlap between model years.The wire set itself holds no surprises. As mentioned by another reviewer, there's no number tags on each wire compared to the Beru. No Biggie. It comes with a small packet of dielectric grease and no wire looms. I had to reuse what was in the car. Again, no biggie. The plug wires are slightly longer but not much.All in all, a good value for money."
4,Good leads and end. No numbering.,Appears of very good quality and includes the OEM Beru ends. Much cheaper than good quality alternatives for the Porsche 928. However the leads are not numbered by cylinder.
1,Was very disappointed in purchasing this book.,"This book was purchased to exploit the new language expansion of Cobol II. The book discuses conversion differences, performance tuning and reading compile output. Expected a lot of sample code depicting the language expansion but there was little. ""Cobol II"" is a misleading title for this book.I just gave a 5 star rating to a book in this discipline but not this one."
2,Poop,"I love getting Peter Brown's children's books for my little cousins, but this one was not at all what I expected from the short description of it. It sounds like the waddles are going to go on a flying adventure, but neglects to mention POOP target practice as a major theme in the book. If you're not a big fan of encouraging potty humor than this probably not the right book for your kid."
2,Not a Fan,"I ordered ""Flight of the Dodo"" for my 6 year old son because I was initially attracted by the cover illustration and overall storyline. Upon reading it, however, I found the writing to be somewhat amateurish and while I do like the soft style of the illustrations, the characters appear emotionless and don't convey any real sense of action. My son thought it was ""just okay"", but whenever I ask him if he wants me to read it, he says no. He usually thinks potty humor is pretty funny. He loves ""Walter the Farting Dog"" and ""Captain Underpants"", but ""Flight of the Dodo"" was not a hit."
1,Read Planet Law School,"This book is pure fluff. It gives nebulous advice than anyone who graduated from high school should know, ""prepare for class, read your notes..."" The book to read about law school is Planet Law School.Planet Law School actually devotes a chapter about the author of Barron's how to Succeed in Law School (HTSILS). After reading that, you will lose all faith in Prof. Munneke (author of Barrons's HTSILA)"
3,Here's what's included . . .,"Buying this boxed set is a good way to get the first three childrens books that Madonna has written. (You're saving money this way, rather than buying them one-by-one.) But this webpage didn't list just what's included in this boxed set. So, after researching a bit on other websites, I found out the three books in this set, and here they are:#1: Her first book, ""The English Roses""#2: Her second book, ""Mr. Peabody's Apples""#3: Her third book, ""Yakov and the Seven Thieves""My review is three stars, average, simply because of the fact that it didn't list the books on this webpage. (Through no fault of the author, or anybody actually associated with these books.) I haven't recieved my books yet, and therefore haven't read them, but am looking forward to it!!"
4,"WOW MADONNA HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY MOMMA, NOW SHE CAN BE YOUR KIDS MOMMA TOO!","Heres the thing. I can't buy this for my kids this Christmas. My baby's mamma will surely be pissed. She will say, ""Nice gift, why don't you go spend the Holidays with MADONNA!""And there I will be, homeless, on the streets with nothing but my Madonna book box set. I might as well just skip this, and buy the old SEX book for myself.But, all jokes aside, the three books here I would recommend for kids. Madonna has surely done some hard living, and these books teach some valuable lessons for kids of all ages. Like, how gossip can be bad, and what true friends are... etc. Good stuff. I think The Madge is aware that kids don't need the type of stuff that is mass marketed for kids these days (Kidz Bop and Bratz) she was her own bitch, not the industrys. This is like whole milk for young minds, not pop rocks and coke. I'd trust this kitten with my kids."
5,Fantastic!,"I picked this one up at an airport a while ago on a whim- I hate romance, but it was this or nothing else... I was suprised to find I enjoyed it so very much- I loved that Ryen was strong, smart and capable.I think Romance requires more charachters like Ryen and less of ignorant 14 year old ""maiden cliche"".I bought a new/used copy from amazon because my old copy wore out- if you liked this, try O'Donnell's ""A Knight of Honor"" too!"
2,This was Awful!,"The story line in this book was so convoluted and implausible that you have trouble imagining the main protaganists acting so out of character. Reyen seems to have multiple personalities and acts out of character much of the time. The story has more perils than than could be humanly possible and it runs on. Some dialog and scenes are well done, but again, so out of character for a female warrior. I had trouble finishing this book and finally did, but with a real appreciation that it was finally over. It seems drawn out and overly contrived. I don't understand the rave reviews."
2,Soooooo slowwwwwww........,"Ok. I'm not even close to half-way on the book and I want to stop. This is supposed to be a romantic love story. Holy crap!!! I really don't feel the love, really. I usually have more patience than this but I can't take it anymore. I just feel like the story is dragging so long. This probably an acquired reading but I really didn't like it. I'm really disappointed."
3,Weaver Flip-up Lense Caps,"The lenses that come ""factory installed"" are OK and work as sddvertised, the replacement lenses that came with the caps were so clouded that they are't worth unrapping. The ""Flip-up"" mechanizem is cheaply made and one of mine is catchy and probaly won't last long. All and all for $10.00 they aren't too bad a deal."
2,Ouch! $5 per battery! You can find this at 10% of this price,"This is an outrageously overpriced product! You can find thesebatteries in bulk (10).... for about 35 cents each! Just search for""CR2016"" These batteries work but they are extremely overpriced. END"
5,Easy to Install---Great for Organizing,"This unit proved to be the perfect unit to organize all the keys I had to keep track of. It was very easy to install---the hooks were perfectly space to accomodate the seemingly myriad number of keys I had to keep track of and they are easy to organzie and then locate. It didn't handle ""car keys"" that well as those are almost too large for the unit---they can work if you are willing to dedicate two ""spaces"" for them but that takes up a lot of room and thus I chose not to store my extra car keys in the security box. The box was attractive, releatively small---and it's appearnace was fine for installing in a public place."
3,:|,"Maggie was dumped by her fiancee two weeks before there wedding, so she has trust issues when it comes ot men. Mitch was dumped by his fiancee after she saw him comforting his assistant, which was purely inncocent, so Mitch has a thing about trust.Maggie leaves her big city life to get away and find some peace, but when money runs low she decides to get a job. Mitch needs someone to fill in for his assistant while she is on maternity leave. Maggie gets the job.The heat between Maggie and Mitch is undeniable, but can they each come to terms with there pasts so that they can have a future?They story is okay. I did not find it real exciting. I wish that the ending had been a bit better. If your looking for a quick read, nothing real gripping or exciting than this book will do."
2,Does not have split tracks as stated,"I am a music teacher and got this CD with the intentions of having the students sing the different patriotic songs then sing them with just the music in split track. Unfurtunately, the CD I have doesn't actually have split tracks as it states on the cover. It has the complete song then 15-18 are the songs again with just the children singing without accompaniment."
3,Not all the same,"Ordered two cables in the same order - got two different cables. Both speaker cables and both the same gauge but both with slightly different cable and slightly different connectors.And slightly different length.You'd think if I ordered two, they'd send two identical ones."
2,Low Quality for the Price,"I was so excited to decorate my sons's room and bought about everything. I was very dissapointed with the quality, especially the bedding set. The blanket faded and pilled on the first wash, and the fitted sheet is so tight that it began to tear. I sewed it back together but ended up pitching it. I suppose if you hand wash the items and line dry you won't have a problem, but who has time for that?"
1,Tiny,"The blade of this knife is said to be 10"" long....not even close. It's more like 5"", very tiny. I can't imagine trying to grip the miniature handles and mincing anything."
5,Suitable for many listeners,"Most of the people who will buy this disc are fans of the show, so in between the tracks listed on Amazon will be skits of the characters, or Lili the fairy. Unless you speak Japanese and are terribly interested in what the characters have to say, try to skip these tracks on the disc. The music is worth it! I don't think there is a disposable piece here."
2,Dull Songs,"Once again in an effort to be humourous about the foibles of America, an author has dragged out the tired and predictable. It's not that this work isn't occasionaly amusing, it's simply that the writing is stale and formulaic. Perhaps it's a function of his radio persona, writing to fill a certain time slot, but each essay has precisely the same rhythm and pace. It's like repetitively humming the same tune; it's tiresome at best. As for substance, Bill Bryson and many others got there first in contemporary times, and Mr. Bouchier is certainly no H.L. Mencken. The former is a pale imitation of the latter with respect to incisive observation and is vastly Mencken's inferior regarding the bon mot. I'd borrow this and other works of the author's from the library; I certainly don't recommend owning them."
5,Heather's Waltz --- Beatiful Guitar Music,"I fell in love with ""Heather's Waltz"" in New York Suite. I wish I could play this beautiful piece on my guitar someday."
4,Interesting no chapter concept,I found this book really good. Some parts were strange cuz I couldn't figure out where they were doing the things they were doing. When people or things pass on it is like a sliding from this plain to the plain of the forever sleeping. Very good book 4 strong stars.
2,chaotic and schizophrenic,"This type of writing exhausts me. Maybe for folks who read a chapter or two per day, or an occasional book on a plane, but if you are a hardcore reader you may find this story nauseating and lurching, as the character, a boy I'd like to like, tells his tale in long rambling sentences to mimic (I guess) the thought processes of how the author thinks a schizophrenic thinks. Maybe it is poetic; maybe it is brilliant. All I know is that there are very few books I don't think I can make it through the second half of the book...I'll update if I manage to finish."
5,best progressive trance cd in years,"All I can say, is that I wish I was in Melbourne for this set. This reminded me of the days when I used to rave and Thomas would shake floor and have everybody crowded around the speakers. Finally. A cd that does him justice and really sums up his skills of mixing uplifting, progrssive dance tunes. Crank up the bass and volume for track 4. You won't forget it."
2,too many photos-not technical enough,"This is a great book if all you want to do is look at the body type and nothing underneath the sheetmetal. So many manufacturers created high performance parts specifically for t/a racing that this book never shows you. A picture of a complete or even dissassembled tunnel port boss 302, t/a 340, amc 390, or Datsun OR ANY ENGINE would be nice. Also, other sources have these cars as being very colorful with lots of unique graphics that black and white photos do no justice to. Finally, many of the pictures seem to repeat themselves. The same car rounding the same type of turns ect..."
5,Fantastic!,This book has everything you might want to know about the Trans-Am racing series from 1966 to 1972. You can't go wrong with this book!
5,2 Screens,Great product. Did exactly what I wanted the product to do. Easy to set up.Worked in a small space.
4,An other gospel country session with George H IV,"Pleasant arrangements on simple tunes, the words of a true believer, that's what you find on this nice CD. Some songs are well known, others not at all, but everything breathes an honest to God atmosphere. This is George H IV at his best, a man from North Carolina, in his own idiom, singing about his oldtime religion, a sample of authenticity. One remark: the long recitations by the end of the CD, of which one is about the life story of John Newton, the author of Amazing Grace, are not as convincing as the singing is. They had better be skipped. For the other tracks: it is recommended stuff."
5,Roofing Book Provides Helpful Information,"I reviewed this book for research on my own book, ""The Roofing and Cladding System Handbook"" by Robert N. Reid. It was a helpful book for anyone with a low slope roof and the diagrams and figures provided some really good information on causes of roofing failures in low slope systems and wind loads. The book also provided very good information for roofing asphalt. I acutally reviewed both the early version written in 1982 and this version written in 1996. I felt that this book is a very good book but it is especially helpful for roofing consultants, and others who specialize in roofing construction and problems."
3,Not the Same,"I ordered this form thinking it would look the same as the picture. It was not! I have ordered it from Amazon before, and it looked like the picture. Apparently, Adams has changed it and it no longer looks like the picture. It is not set up the way we would like, but it will do."
5,Why? Because I'll do it!,This set of tapes is probably my third Leslie Sansome purchase. These tapes have made me an everyday mover. I have never liked just to exercise for exercise sake. (I would rather play soccer and ride a bike.) Ms. Sansome does a fine job of encouraging people to work hard to their own possibilites. I go between the 2 and 3 mile workout usually throughout the week. What is encouraging to me is that I have been able to work up to completion of each tape. Nagging discomforts are much reduced when I use these tapes on a daily basis. I would recommend these tapes for someone who wants a nudge to workout and feel better.
4,"Easy, fun home workout","I love WALK AWAY THE POUNDS!! That's exactly what you'll do if you use the tapes regularly. The set comes with a 1 mile-get up and get started, 2 mile-high calorie burn and 3 mile-super fat burn. This set also includes a pair of weighted balls that make the workouts more challenging. They are easy to hold and are of about 2 lbs each. I would recommend this tape for anyone who wants to get in shape and can't get to the gym. Great, easy to do home workout!"
4,"Great, motivating videos!","I just started using Leslie's workout system and I have to tell you that I just love it! I'm not very interested in working out, so I HAVE to like what I am doing in order to keep my interest. I needed to combine some aerobic activity with my Yoga practice in order to burn my calories. Leslie's program does not require a lot of room to complete and she is very motivating without being ""overkill."" I also love the fact that she has different types of people doing the workout (older and younger, great shape and not so great shape).The only negative I really have is that I find the weights that are supplied to be a bit annoying. I didn't realize you have to fill them with water, which takes a LONG time. I thought they were going to be already filled. I use my regular two pound hand-weights with the program and they are just fine.Good Luck with your weight loss program! If you get these videos, I promise you won't be disappointed!"
2,Leslie Sansone's Weight Balls,"I really liked Leslie Sansone's exercise tape. However, the weights were not very good. First of all, they needed to be filled with water. The whole is tiny and nearly impossible to fill. I finally did fill then but, could not get two pounds of water in each of them. I tried to get the plug out to add more water but it broke. I finally had to purchases my own weight balls, that were filled with sand."
5,Simple and effective,I love this video. It is perfect for days when I can't get to the gym. There are only four basic steps which makes it very easy to follow. I like to mute the sound and play my favorite dance music while following along. I love that I get an upper body workout too (I just use my own 3lb dumb bells which works fine). The 3 workouts gives you great options and variety. I am very happy with this purchase.
1,OVER PRICED AND OVER HYPED,"INFOMERCIALS BUG ME, AND WHEN A FITNESS PROGRAM LIKE THIS IS SOLD, I FALL VICTIM TO WANTING TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE, AND THIS WORKOUT I DO NOT BELIVE IN. THE WEIGHT LOSS CLAIMS CANNOT BE TRUE, AND THE PEOPLE WERE TAKING FAT BURNER PILLS TO LOSE THE WEIGHT. THE ROUTINES ARE VERY PLAIN AND SIMPLE AND NOT VERY EFFECTIVE, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Walk away the Pounds.,I likes the Walk Away the Pounds 3 pack tape. However the wieight set was a big disapointment. It said fill withwater but how do you get the water in and how do you know how much to put in ?
5,Excellent,Leslie Sansone Walking away the pounds CD excellent. I like this one because it has a 3 exercise routines on one CD. I would recommend it for anyone. It is great for when the weather doesn't allow you to get out. You can use 2lb. dumb bells if you don't have the weighted balls.
4,Walk Away The Pounds,"Great workout...definitely not a 'sissy' workout. If you are looking for a good cardio workout, this is it. Having a choice of the 1, 2 or 3 mile walk is great for time management."
5,Love it!,Now only after two days of doing these tapes I can feel the effects already! These tapes are easy to follow and you don't need a whole lot of room to do it either. Leslie is very encouraging and supportive. You don't ever get confused but the challenge is there too with the 2 mile and the 3 mile. I plan to use these tapes every day and I'm sure I will see great results and soon. The only problem I had was with those weights! Filling them with the water that is! It was not as easy as I thought it would be and now one is over inflated! Oh well - I can use my dumbells instead but otherwise a great buy - I totally recommend it to anyone looking to lose the pounds. Now if only I can stop eating the candied popcorn the weight may come off even faster!
5,Outstanding Workout,"People like Betty Sue really has no business writing reviews that give out false information. I doubt that she has even tried the Leslie Sansone tapes. It is BLATANTLY false to claim that walking in the parking lot can give you just as good of a workout. These tapes, especially the 2 and 3 miles walk, are really outstanding aerobic workouts and the weights give you good upper body training. Trust me, this is a really wonderful set of tapes. I have lost 25 pounds in the last 4 months to prove it!"
2,Unhappy,"I am quite pleased with the three exercise tapes that I ordered, but am very unhappy with the flat weighted balls that came with the tapes. One stopper is missing and the balls cannot be filled with water. I would have never ordered the tapes including theballs if I had known that they had to be filled with water. I would like to return the balls and get a refund, but I don't know who to return them to."
4,The best workout I've done!!,"I absolutely love this workout! It's so easy yet effective and it's something I actually enjoy and want to do everyday! The only thing I think could improve this workout is I think she needs to add some more stretching. I really don't think she does enough but I just do them on my own when the tape is over. Other than that I would definately recommend this tape to anyone,especially those who are just starting out because it's fun and easy to stick with!"
2,Not as good as Leslie's other videos,"I bought this dvd collection as a follow-up to the 2 mile walk, which I love. I wasn't impressed with the workout at all. #1 tape is for beginners so I didn't even try it. #2 was the High Calorie Burn. The steps were boring and she didn't do counts of 8, as she usually does. It just seemed like this dvd was thrown together. The banter between the exercisers was awful and distracting. The music wasn't loud enough and Leslie looked horrible. The use of the weights seems un-thought-out and just thrown in. I love Leslie Sansone, what happened with this DVD?"
2,I have some problems with this set,"During the just walking segments the participants have no arm movements - just hanging arms, and lots of casual chatting, so that kind of annoys me. Also the frequent mentions of how wonderful the balls are and benefits of walking make it seem like I'm working out to an infomercial. I just bought her variety pack set (from Collage) and so far just tried the Jog Walk video from that, and I really REALY like it! (hint) It also comes with Jog Kick, and Jog Yoga (these I haven't tried yet)"
2,not very good,"I do not think this tape was very effective. I would think a very obese person would benefit from it, but to lose a few pounds it is not worth the money, I felt no benefits after 4 weeks of doing it, I started with the 3 mile right away & did it 6 days a week"
1,leslie sonsone,"the tapes maybe ok but keep an eye on your credit card account, they keep sending tapes and charging your credit card. wish I had never made the phone call"
1,Not What I Expected,"I have the DVD of this program and it's quite good. I thought the CD would be the same workout so I could do it while watching TV. However, it was not. I'm looking for a good indoor walking CD."
1,walk around your block and save the money,"this is so lame, i thought this might have value, but it does not at all. i would rather walk around my neighborhood than to listen to this odd shaped woman doing standing aerobics."
4,Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was actually looking to buy a FIRM video, but it wasn't priced and I was in a rush. I knew the 3 Mile Walk Away the Pounds used weights as well so bought it instead.I love it. Before you know it, you've done 47 minutes of aerobic exercise and have worked out your upper body with weights for about 20 minutes (I used dumbells).The only thing I have a complaint about (and it could be on my side) is that I wore my pedometer when doing this and it did not register 3 miles."
3,nice to listen to,"Richie Havens was never a huge artist but he was very respectable.His strange voice and his acoustic guitar make him a unique figure in music history.Resume is a pretty good best of album with some really beautiful songs(although almost all are covers).Drown in My Own Tears is probably the greatest track on here,but songs like Dolphins,Here Comes The Sun,and Klan are also of very high quality.Two other very famous tracks,Handsome Johnny and Freedom,are also very good but miss the allure of the live version on Woodstock.Yes,Freedom was recorded there but it is a shorter version which is a shame.Still,a very nice album to lay back on and enjoy."
4,some terrific performances on this CD,"Richie Havens has a unique and lovely way with the songs of his era. His cover of Fred Neil's ""Dolphins"" is incredibly strong. It's sung live, as are several of the other takes on this CD. What's especially impressive is his ability to project dramatic songs like ""The Klan"" and ""Minstrel from Gault"", which many folk singers would shrink from. And ""Handsome Johnny"" is a fine protest song composed by Havens and actor Lou Gossett."
4,"Creative and different guest book, but small","Make sure you take notice of the dimensions, because this book is rather tiny.The cards are business card size, and enough room for guests to leave a small message. The book then contains pages to place the cards, three per side. The pages remind me of a cheap photo album quality, but they appear to do the job.The cards themselves seem of average thickness, once again similar to a business card, and have words at the top that instruct the guest to write a wedding day wish for the couple, in a nice silver font.It might be easier display the book near the cards, laid out on a table. Then have a small basket for the guests to place the cards after they have written a message. This might reduce the risk of a tear to the book, and enable more people to write in a shorter amount of time.It is a creative idea to use rather than just a regular guest book, and gives people a chance to be more personal."
3,wedding guest book,Book is nice and contains enough cards but was a little more then expected but will still be using for my wedding
5,Simply awesome,"If you like trance-y, bass-ey music with a middle eastern flavor, this is a great choice."
4,a must buy,"if you love middle eastern vibes , smartly put togetherwith an occident spice, here is your deal.good pieces....i loved it"
4,Highly Entertaining,"I watched this video with my two sons, ages 6 and 13, and we all loved it! The music, the photography, the animation, the narration and the fun (and sometimes gross) facts make this video well worth it. What an entertaining way to get kids interested and involved in learning more about the world around them!"
2,Double-edged sword,"From an adult's perspective: worst movie ever. Almost unbearable to watch.However, my kid likes it. He doesn't notice the extremely crude animation, or awful music. He likes the dinosaurs and other creepy creatures.So, not sure what to say. The good thing is that some kids like it. The bad thing is you might have to watch it yourself."
3,So so book...some funny things,"I bought this off the reviews and some of it was funny, but it was not near as funny as others led on."
4,Yep.,"A lot of these are things you look at and say to yourself ""Yeah, I can see where that wouldn't be a good idea."" But it's funny because you probably know someone who's done it.Not deep but good for a quick laugh."
1,Tragic,"The first thing a man over 30 should never do: buy an offensive, elitist book telling them how they should live their own life. You've got to love the wisdom of the book. For instance, a man over 30 should never know a vegan, according to the book. Way to alienate a crowd, Esquire. Lovely.EDIT: Oh, I understand perfectly that its a humor book. Its just not funny."
5,It works!,"My daughter kept getting sick at school and I asked one of my friends who used alternative remedies for a recommendation. She suggested this product. My daughter's flu went away in about a day and now I give it to her whenever she seems like she might be getting sick and she doesn't get sick. I've even taken it once. We tried Emergen-C and it didn't really work. But this one, I am really impressed."
5,Great teacher for beginners,"I was a backyard rink player as a kid and never had the benefit of a coach. When I began to pick up the game as an adult this year I bought numerous books on ""how to"" play hockey. Mr. Falla's book was by far the best for me.Simple explanations of the game and how to play it.Not too technical, not too long, and just right for me.HIghly recommended."
4,"Moody, Dark and Beautiful","A moody, dark psychological thriller. Beautiful camera angles and scenes throughout. A quirky story - a sort of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" gone terribly wrong... I watched this on a recommendation from a friend and was pleasantly surprised by how much fun it was."
3,Old Time Radio Fun!,"All I can say is Spike Jones was one of a kind. I'm an old time radio fan and these shows, with their celebrity guests (particularly the horror/mystery ones, like Karloff & Lorre), make it even more fun to listen to."
4,"Thank you, music lovers!","This CD features two half-hour episodes of the Spike Jones radio show from the late 1940s. The first episode guest-stars Boris Karloff. The second episode guest-stars Peter Lorre. Both shows are pretty funny, in a slightly corny kind of way. I should mention that this CD is not Volume 2 of the series, it's Volume 1."
4,Cry vs. Cry,"This movie is NOT the movie of the same title based on Gary Paulsen's book, ""Hatchet"". Despite the identical titles, this movie is based on a very real abduction and manhunt in 1963, in central Pennsylvania. Both were released on TV in 1990, but this movie had the subtitle ""The Taking of Peggy Ann."" It is a very accurate account of the kidnapping of teenager Peggy Ann Bradnick, and the ensuing search that cost the life of FBI agent Terry Anderson (played by David Soul) before the kidnapper, William Hollenbaugh, was killed by the police.The ""Hatchet"" ""Cry"" is available in DVD from Amazon. The ""Peggy Ann"" ""Cry"" is only out in VHS."
2,Not much different from Trader Joe's Regular Walnuts,"I got these to try because some reported that they are much much different from regular walnuts. I normally eat the 'premium walnut halves' from Trader Joe's (in the US). I found that these were not much different in flavor, or indeed not as good in flavor. They were broken pieces with a lot of bitter dark skin on them and twice as expensive as the Trader Joe's walnuts. I would not recommend these to anyone over the Trader Joe's walnuts."
2,Good as a starter book.,"If your starting out, first year or two in the business. I have 20+ years and didn't get any value of of it."
2,Equus 8264 Electric Oil Pressure Gauge,"If i had to do it all over again, I would not purchase this brand. I bought 5 gauges and have replaced three of them already via the manufacturer"
1,CAT-ASTROPHIC,"This is what happens when the money runs out and an artist tries to second guess what people want to hear from them. In having done so this bunch of tired, un-constructed, non entities masquerading as songs is the result. And it is not pretty let me tell you. Every song goes off in an un-focused direction trying to arrive somewhere in metal territory where it is never going to get. Mild highlights are ""Blue Moon Over Brooklyn"" whose intent is sweet and heartfelt but is ruined by hideous rhyming (?) couplets such as 'he started crying/said mom was dying' and the grasping at straws remake of ""Beth"" that has a nice stripped back acoustic treatment (see poolside Phantom of the Park) but non of the sincere emotion of the original cut. Surely for completionary purposes only? I am doubting there are any Kiss fans anywhere who pay homage to this in the way say 'The Elder' is dealt. Avoid if able to resist the challenge of completing the collection."
2,Not working properly - shop around,"This product was reco'd through the message board. I had previously returned another scale by another company. Thought this would be an improvement, but it's no better. It comes with an adapter which is very good compared to battery operated. It never ever gets the weight correct. Mainly the weight is 0.00, it just doesn't register. When you go to the website for troubleshooting and tech support, there are two pages of why it doesn't work.Shop around."
5,Great scale at a good price,"After researching all the scales offered here on Amazon, I purchased this one. The scale arrived in perfect condition, has performed flawlessly on batteries, and is very accurate and consistent. It weighs 2/10 of one ounce over my local post office, about perfect so I don't put insufficient postage using USPS internet site, Click-N-Ship. I'm very happy with this scale, especially for the money. Hopefully I won't have to use it, but the manufacturer appears to have a solid lifetime warranty on this scale. The manual and warranty information is available online so you can look that information over before purchasing..."
1,Flaky!,"This has been worthless since the day I got it. Numbers bounce all over the place, won't weigh anything accurately within 5 lbs. I emailed the seller and he sent me a long email telling me that I had to put it on a level table, couldn't have any humidity, etc, and the numbers bouncing all around was one of the symptoms. Well, I tried everything he advised and now I'm just trying to get a refund. I had a cheap Weighmax scale before this, and it worked very well for about a year, then quit working. It was better than this piece of junk! You get what you pay for, I guess!"
4,Good starting point for ActiveX Control creation,"Of the various ActiveX control books I have, this one is really for beginners. I am preparing MCSD exams and find ActiveX part in Hawhee's book too condensed. Without much prior knowledge about it, piling information in Hawhee's book is just too much to understand/remember. I also read Dan Appleman's book which is quite good theoretically, but it doesn't teach you the much about the actual steps. So Appleman's book is harder to follow than this book. I'd say combining the three books makes a lot of sense. While this book provides hands-on guidance, it doesn't teach you the things behind the scene, where Appleman's book does great on. The hawhee's book, on the other hand, provides a good review which lets you find the holes in your knowledge.The first comment is right on that the book has many errors. Also the writing sometimes is wordy."
5,"Hosa 1/4"" speaker cables","Everything you might expect in a heavy duty 1/4"" speaker cable and more. The wire gauge is quite heavy and can carry a great deal of power between the amp and the speakers. There are built in strain reliefs on the ends. Overall, an excellent choice for high power speaker connections."
5,This is a Very Good Amp Head To Speaker Cabinet Cable,"12 Gauge Speaker Cable is my personal Minimum size, although I use a different brand of Cables for my own Personal use, this cable is very good for the price. This Cable was a gift to our local high school."
5,an UnDemocratic Reality,Those that rule have wealth & power. They construct a society to protect themselves from the rest of us. Gamson's book may cause you to seriously wonder if Democracy exists in the US. It will clear the cob webs from your eyes & help break through our culturally induced ideological brainwashing.
1,New style Auto Repair Order,"Figures Adams Has to change a Good thing the Older ones were so much better! There was more room to put in what you did on vehicle on Right side they made it smaller, on the NEW Ones the only 4 rows now! and you cant get the older ones . Ive been lookin for the older ones No More u have to get the big ones if u want more room. I RETURNED Mine lookin somewhere else! dont get these small ones u wont like them!"
3,its ok but not great,the old version did not have so many things cramped on the right hand side. packages both came with the protective wrapper wripped half off and a few corners of the papers were frayed. No big deal for me personal because it was just going in a small-town garage but it wasnt very professional. Found out later that wlmrt sells this same version for around the same price
2,Change in format,"We have used this item for the past three years. Now, the company decided to change the format. The format change was not noted on the description and the stock number was not changed. Why fix it if it is not broke. My problem is with the product not the service. My order was delivered in one day, my return was processed very quickly and a refund was issued."
1,disappointed,"I have purchased this product many times in the last 5 years. There was a major format change. They have tried to account for every possible bit of information. So much so, that there isn't enough room for labor charges. They left a tiny box at the bottom right for the total. It used to be a great product for a great price. I will find a different invoice to use."
2,repair tickets,The item I recieved isn't what I wanted - it didn't match the picture on your website. It was easy to exchange with the provided mailing label I printed out - just a little hastle.
5,Chipset Core Speed/500 MHz Memory / 600MHz,"Got this card with a Athlon 64 3000+, 120GB SATA HD, 80GB IDE HD, Abit Max3 MOBO, 1GB OCZ Gold PC-4000 RAM, Audigy 2 Card, Logitech Z-640 speakers, Antec Sonata Case, and a Cooler MasterSimilar performance to the 9600 Pro, but with slightly higher clock speeds and a coupon for a free copy of Half-Life 2. I made the mistake of buying this card over a 9500 card because HL2 probably wont come out. But it's worth a shot. I like the screensavers you get on the catalyst driver disk. They were the most popular file share at my last LAN party. I also like the retail box. You can cut out the ATI logo with the ""RADEON XXXX"" and stick it on your case. The little security badge thingie is also pretty fun to play with..."
5,Essential desk reference for any network engineer,"I picked up this book at 1:00, and by 3:00 had copies of it for all the network engineers in our staff. Without a doubt, the best design and implementation guide (checklists for everything) I've seen on routing and switching technology. Very strong chapters relating to SNA, ATM, and multimedia integration. If you maintain or design networks with with Cisco routers, you need this book."
3,not so good as most people's review,"in fact, it just explains more deeperly than the ccnp routing book and don't get the step that expounds the routing protocols throughout.with all other cisco books , they are only technologies guide."
2,Owner of business,The first one we purchased may have gotten too hot in the truck but it quit reading. The second one didn't work from the beginning and we had to send it back. Perhaps it was just faulty from the get go.
5,a positively encyclopaedic reference on modernism,"This book is exactly what those studying modernity needed--a thoughtful, unpretentious look at art and culture from the turn of the century through the present. Extremely accessible and highly supplementary to art and lit classes, Modern Times, Modern Places does an excellent job at orienting and contextualizing what has come to be called ""modern art."" 5 stars to Peter Conrad for accomplishing such an ambitious project with aplomb."
2,Watch Conrad show off!,"Even allowing for the encyclopedic reach of this book, one can't help feeling Conrad is saying, 'Aren't I just the smartest guy you know?' And I disagree that his prose is fluid, stylish. I find it dense, frustratingly convoluted, and often needlessly elliptical as well."
2,A very bad book,An extremely disappointing book. Sentences with no logical sense at all are fine in poetry but in a book that purports to explain the phenomenon of modernism nothing but ridiculous. Conrad's grasp of science is very bad but he doesn't care about that and has quite a few inaccurate things to say about it. Avoid!
1,A waste of time,"To be avoided unless you expect to live forever. Mr. Conrad piles up references from all the books he has (supposedly) read, namedropping furiously along the way. There is however no central idea, no real understanding of the perod he is writing about, he just rants on and on. Also the prose is stuck in a quagmire of cliches, very pretentious stuff - to clever by half, some would say, but not clever at all in my mind. You won't get anywhere with this volume of 750 pages."
3,Like it,"Hi there .. I like this product but in fact I didn't like the color (Crystal Clear) , because after few days it's become close to Yellow . But it's fit and strong ."
2,tight fit,"I used these on a 2001 honda civic. I had to drill out the hole for the emergency brake. The hold was there but was not quite big enough. Also when I got them on, I could barely fit the drum back on. It was a very tight fit. I did adjust them as much as possible to make the drum easier to get on."
4,Seamless double narrative,"Friends and co-authors Philip Craig and William Tapply really have figured out the secret to co-writing a mystery story. They alternate chapters, each featuring their leading character, and one chapter leads into the next in a smooth and seamless style. In this second dual effort, J.W. Jackson is asked to be the driver for Evangeline, a Madonna-like celebrity who is appearing at the Celebration for Humanity which is being produced on Martha's Vineyard. Meanwhile, J.W.'s buddy Brady Coyne has been asked by a friend to find her runaway daughter before her father dies from a terminal illness. Evangeline's director and her bodyguard are killed and J.W. and Brady soon find themselves entangled with a religious cult and a psychic. The psychic is killed and the two strands of plots begins to intersect and become entwined. The two authors keep the action moving and create an enjoyable mystery, despite a couple of minor plot hitches along the way."
3,It Is OK At Best,"I hate to be the party pooper among all the good reviews here, but this mystery was pretty poor. I'm a big fan of mysteries and detective fiction and there aren't many that I don't enjoy reading. But I expect the detective heroes to have some brains and I don't expect an out-of-the-blue solution to save the day. Through the whole book (this isn't really a spoiler), it's pretty obvious that something big and bad is going to happen at a big public event. Our two detectives are well aware of this. Yet, when the event happens, these two dolts are miles away, clueless. These guys are old, slow, and not too bright, and they'd rather be sipping martinis and fly fishing. The authors should retire them to that life."
1,I'll never buy this again.,I have enjoyed this product for many years. Now they have changed it and it sucks. I bought 12 bags not knowing they changed it and After tasting it I threw them out. Very disappointed.
1,Too big for a CZ 527 .223,"It is supposed to fit, but it is too big to go in a CZ 527 that is chambered in .223"
2,Won't Last Long,"I bought this cart for hauling buckets of water and some tools around our garden. We have a 4 x 40 foot garden and needed a heavy duty garden cart. After having seen garden carts for well over $100 at hardware stores we thought this seemed like a good value. Well, after having put this thing together, I can say you get what you pay for. Wheels are only held on by cheap cotter pins, which is the most heinous of this cart's issues. This causes the wheels to wobble slightly. As well, the cotter pins are CHEAP. They will rust in a couple days outside. When those break, say goodbye to your wheels, since nothing else holds them to the axles. This cart will be lucky to last the summer."
2,Hub socket fracture,"Within one day of receiving delivery and after having made several 1/2"" wide, 1 1/2"" deep mortises in a 2x4 piece of redwood, the hub holding the operating handle cracked causing a portion of the hub and the handle to fall off. The hub failure occurred while plunging about 1/2""deep into the redwood board. Prior the socket breaking, the machine function well and easily and accurately made several mortises. Unfortunately, without a way to attach the handle the machine is unusable."
4,Powermatic Bench Top Mortiser,"This is a very sturdy and well-designed machine. A slight adjustment is needed during the setup for mortising to ensure that the work table is square to the chisel, but other than that, this machine is everything it is advertised to be."
3,Arrived rusted and pitted,"The PM701 Bench Mortiser arrived with severe rusting and pitting on the base. Didn't appear to be any protective oil on the machined surface. Perhaps this was a returned or demo item. I contacted PowerMatic directly and they were helpful and sent out new base and fence. I haven't set up the machine yet to evaluate its performance, but I am hopeful, after a very disappointing beginning."
3,Caution on re-wiring for 230V: the schematic is wrong,"I bought a 701 mortiser and immediately re-rewired it for 230-V operation exactly per the schematic on the back of the manual. I am an Electrical Engineer and have done it on my Model 66 and my Model 89 Jointer. When I plugged it in and ran it, the motor and controls smoked. Upon investigation, there is a small decal on the back of the inside of the control head cover, and the diagram on the decal is different from the schematic on the manual!! I have called Amazon.com and they are replacing the unit, but if you're going to re-wire for 230V, call PM for confirmation from them that the decal on the unit is correct, because obviously the schematic in the manual is wrong!"
1,Broken on arrival - with update,"This is more a jab at Amazon and their shipper - I just unpacked my new 701, and the cast iron base is cracked. I was afraid this would happen based on numerous reviews of power tools shipped by Amazon, and sure enough, it did.I've started the process of either getting an entirely new machine or replacing the base. More to follow...Wow! That was fast. New mortiser arrived w/in three days of reporting the problem and was intact. Kudos to Amazon for fast customer service, raspberries to UPS for careless shipping."
4,Fine for sub-megapixel digital cameras,"As the previous reviewer noted, 8 meg isn't enough to be useful in an MP3 player. However, the format was designed to be used WITH DIGITAL CAMERAS, not with MP3 players. On my 1.3 megapixel digital camera, an 8 mb card holds around 25 pictures -- just like a roll of film. If you have an older digital camera (Phillips ESP80, Ricoh RDC-4300, Fuji DX-7, and a bunch of others), 8 MB is the biggest card you can use (the cameras won't recognize bigger cards), so this card is an appropriate choice. If your camera's at least 2 years old, check your manual to see the biggest card you can use. If you have a newer camera, however, the $$ per meg is much more attractive with a 16 or 32 meg card."
1,Please Read This,This thing is a piece of junk. Who need 8 mb. You can fit like 2 songs with 8mb. Don't get this please. I beg you.
3,Started out pretty good...,"This story started out pretty good. I was happy to see a character that was not willow thin, fine, delicate, etc. It was nice for a story to have a character that was more realistic (curvy, full, tall, etc). However, the story line got old when every other paragraph was about the heroine putting herself down and not being able to believe anyone could accept her figure. It got very boring actually. The writing is a bit long winded. I got bored half way through and couldn't even bring myself to finish it."
4,4 stars,"This book made me laugh so it get's a good score. I enjoyed Byron's writing style too, asside from actually making some funny jokes, I loved a lot of her scene transitions. It would sometimes go from flowery and cliched to abrupt and passive aggressive just for the sake make a humorous point about a characters uncertainly.The heroine's low self-esteem bordered on tedious but I didn't get annoyed because I like self-deprecating characters."
5,It FITS!!!,This product fits my Canon T2i stock lens just fine (that's the standard lens that came with the camera in the store). A friend borrowed the camera and lost the original cap. This is a very affordable replacement that is perfectly compatible with the 58mm-lens opening.The little quick-release clips (as pictured on the left and right of the lens cap) work great... just like the original cap worked.
4,It fits,The lens cap fits my kit lens perfectly. Minus one star because it cost ~$10 but still better than nothing.
5,excellent fir,This cover has a better fit than the original one.Actually this is why we needed a new one because we lost the original.
3,Good but not perfect,"this work fine with my additional Lense cover, but this one doesn't have hole to hook the string to camera.so have to caeful with kkeping my pocket.except this. it's OK. this is just cap what else I expect"
3,Good Product,"Lens cap doesn't fit on standard lens, only on the adapter, but that's great when using filters. The standard cover doesn't fit on the adapter sleeve, so if you leave the sleeve installed, it is mandatory for covering the lens. Great price on the cap. Would like to have some means to restrain the cap when removed, but that's a function of the Canon design, not the merchant."
3,Got two,"I ordered this as the description for the Cannon S5 did not state having a lens cap, but when I received the camera, there was a lens cap provided. Had to return the one I ordered separately."
4,"Quality is good, as it is from Canon","It's good as my title says, however, I found one con about it is there is no place I can put a string on it so that I have to put it in my pocket when I take it off."
3,Not a replacement for Canon S2 IS,I have the Canon S2 IS. I bought this as a replacement for the orignal lens cap that falls off constantly. This cap does not fit. It can only be used with the optional filters.
2,E-58U versus E-58,"I have a run-of-the-mill Canon EOS Rebel XSi that came with 2 lenses (18-55 and 55-250). After dropping one of the lens caps over a pier I started to look for a replacement. The cap I had lost was the E58, but the other day when I ordered the closest I could find was the E58U. You would assume it to be the same, and it almost is. It fits, but is different to the E58 (I still have one to make the direct comparison with) in that the little finger grips on the edge that you push to release the cap are just a fraction harder to operate. They sit flush with the edge of the cap. On my E58 cap they protrude very slightly so are easier to grip and manipulate. Also the E58U cap doesn't fit quite as well...can be flicked off without using the grips. Get the E58 if you can."
4,Does the job...,"The cap is a nice accessory to my Canon equipment. However, for the price of the lens cap, I could have found something cheaper to do the job. I also wish it had an attached string so it couldn't get lost if it came off.So....if you're like me and want all your camera equipment to advertise Canon, this lens cap is for you. If you like pinching pennies, you can save about 6 bucks on this item. It's all about preference."
3,Lens cap,"Its a lens cap - it works. It fits the lens adapter barrel, not the wider lens hood. I dont use the lens hood anyway, it blocks the popup flash on the camera. I keep the barrel adapter - with a uv filter and this lens cap - on the camera all the time."

3,WAY overpriced!,This lens cap was $22.00 because it has the Canon name on it. It was made in China and probably cost a dime to make. I bought another comparable lens cap for my other camera after reading the reviews on Amazon. This cap was $2.00 and was made in Taiwan. It's called the Dopo Snap On. It fit better on the Canon lens than the Canon lens cover. I could have purchased ten of these for the price of one Canon lens cover. Never again.
5,Lens cap,"Perfect! It fits just like the original that I left somewhere! I guess I should buy a cap keeper, but that's not convenient when you change lenses a lot."
5,It's a Lens Cap,"It does what it's supposed to but I bought it for the logo/name on the front of it. I have a Canon, of course, and the lens needed a cap. It's a lens protector, and it does just that!"
3,Black as night,"I picked three stars because you can find 58mm non-canon lense caps for less money elsewhere. It's a pretty simplistic device, go cheep, nobody will care if it says Canon or not.I don't entirely know what else to say. It's a lense cap. When I put it on my camera, dust stays off the lense and the pictures are black as night."
3,SNAP ON? NOT SO SURE,This does not actually 'snap on' as the product name suggests. You actually have to check visually to make sure it is sitting firmly in place.
2,Lacks eyelet for cord,I was disappointed to find that this cap does not have an eyelet to accept a small cord to attach it to the camera body. That means the cap is subject to falling off or otherwise getting lost.
5,Genuine product,Shipped fast. Inexpensive and fits well over 58 mm lenses and addons. What you see is what you get. Would have been better with a string or cord.
5,Just what I needed,This is apparently the oem cap. It fits perfectly and it arrived earlier than expected. I also purchased the little elastic straps to attach it to my lens so I won't keep losing my lens caps.
3,Release grips could be better.,"The Canon Lens caps that come with most of your lenses are highly effective for their purpose, they fit snug, and protect well. I have never had the cap fall off unintentionally.The downfall of this (and most) canon lens caps are the release feature. When your lens is outfitted with its respective lens hood it becomes very difficult to snap the cap on the lens or filter. Unless you have a very wide and short hood on your lens, (like hoods for an ultra wide angle), one will always have problems quickly removing / adding the cap.Sigma has designed the release of their lens caps as a center squeeze as opposed to canon's edge release. This is much more convenient and easier to use than canons system."
5,Nice Cap,It snaps on nicely. What else can I say? It performs just as you would expect a lens cap to perform.
4,works as advertised,"I gave it a 4 star rating because though it works as advertised, its missing one very important feature (the reason i lost it in the first place)...It needs a strap or a string so that you can attach it to the camera."
1,How do I return?,I bought this product and it didn't fit the camera lens. The clips were the wrong style or something. I sent an email to five star experience because I couldn't return it through amazon. The lens cap was in good shape but I obviously can't use it. If someone could please let me know how I can return this product I would greatly appreciate it.
1,Canon lens cap,This did NOT fit my Canon Powershot S5 IS and had to be returned. My suggestion if you need a cap is to go to a camera store to ensure that the cap fits properly.
1,lens cap,"Ordered this to replace the one that fell off and got lost for my camera, it was the wrong size, specifically put my exact model in and this is the one they sent me. There is NO replacement for my exact model at this time....Total Waste."
5,Nice Cap,"Lost my original canon cap in the woods somewhere, bought this to replace it. It works! I found my old one in the woods a year later, cleaned it off, and now I don't know which is which. I use them both. They are the same."
1,Poor design,"The cap does the job of covering the lens. However, it is poorly designed. If you have a hood on your lens the cap is nearly impossible to impossible to get off without removing the hood EACH time you need to cap or uncap the lens. I have several Tamron lenses that I used for my outdoor photography job and they are designed such that they can be removed with the hood on. I would think a company like Canon would not have overlooked this simple flaw."
1,Lens cap was incorrectly advertized.,"I typed in for a Cannon Powershot 10is lens cap and found a couple of items. When it arrived it would not fit. Amazon sent me to the shipper and he clearly stated it wouldn't fit. Since Amazon advertized it, they would not do anything, not even remove it from that search so that the next poor sucker wouldn't spend money on something that doesn't fit. My advise is to go to another site and deal with people who stand behind their products and not try to slide responsibilities to another."
2,FINE FOR KIDS,"This apron is thin and SHORT--""full length"" for a child. When you include the exorbitant shipping rate, it's just not worth it."
3,Cloth Apron,This Apron is fine if Hard Labor is-not required.Its cloth was a little too thin for me.The Paper machine I operate rubbed a hole in it after three days.The length is ideal for protection of your clothing.The Port Authority half apron has thick cloth material and lasted for months in my job.This is great for labor with no contact with machinery.Not a heavy-duty product but well made.
3,So So but it's Pink,"So So quality, but it was pink and that was the point. I should have bought a 3 pack of white ones and dyed them myself."
2,pink apron,"This apron is lighter in terms of the fabric weight than what i expected. I also did not see from the picture that the tie for the apron is one string that runs through from one side, up around the neck, and then out the other side to tie together. Unfortunately this shortens the length of the apron considerably. This was a gift for a person who is not on the small side and thus in order to tie it around the person it looks more like a bib than an apron."
3,Only an Introduction to the Subject,"If you know nothing about taxes on gambling this is probably a solid introduction to the subjects of record keeping and the potential impact of alternate minimum tax.If you are a ""professional gambler"" there should be very little here that you don't know. There is a brief discussion of the pros and cons of professional versus recreational. Also, in passing it mentions that you file a Schedule C and that to establish as a business you need to meet standard IRS requirements, but there is no sample Schedule C here despite at least three examples of Form 1040 for recreational gamblers.About half of the book is either ""filler"" or ""reference"" from other sources."
1,Not a very exciting suspense!!,"A reader will enjoy this the first time but it isnt really a very exciting suspense.In her early(white cover)editions of Sweet Valley High,Kate William was a very boring writer."
4,Very useful,"I have Minjung's pocket Korean-English/English-Korean dictionary (like most decent East Asian dictionaries, you will probably need to go to an ethnic bookstore to find it) however I find this Langenscheidt to be very useful for beginners who need reinforcement on how pronunciation changes when certain letters are adjacent to each other. The romanization reflects pronounciation instead of mindless transcription of Hangul letters to roman letters. It is quite easy to understand actually and the Hangul is provided next to the romanization.The fonts used are crisp, pleasing and easy on the eyes (unlike the NTC Dictionary which looks like the authors used a typewriter and then had the pages photocopied at a grocery store). But remember this really is a pocket-sized dictionary."
2,OK for beginners.,"I say that it's OK for beginners because it's not search-able by the Korean character system. Once you get familiar with Korean characters, you'll see why this is a problem. It's a well put together book, very concise as far as I can tell, but I just can't imagine who would prefer a book like this over one that is organized with the Korean letters first.I suppose if you had no intention of going to Korea or actually using Korean for communicative purposes, you would be ok with this book."
3,Pretty good for the price,"I bought this book because that my Korean teacher said that I needed to buy a dictionary for the class, but did not specify what kind to purchase.I can say that this has been helpful in situations outside of the class room, but is not really useful when trying to figure out the English translation of the Korean writing.Useful when:Trying to write in Korean, using Hangul.Translating an English word into Hangul.Figuring out the English meaning from spoken Korean.Not useful when:Trying to translate written Korean.Figuring out phrases.Looking for the English-lettering (romanization) of a Korean word.In the end, I suggest a Korean-English dictionary written for and by Koreans. You can find these at some Asian markets and bookstores, they are also only about $5-10 more."
5,Truly Inspirational,A great collection of motivating Gospel songs. The track titled Return speaks to the heart and soul. God speaks thru Esther's music. Highley recommemnd and look forward in seeing the rise of Esther's singing career.
4,GREAT light for a smaller setup,"I would def modify (if I could) the light to be adjustable -it just beams in one straight direction once it's suctioned on.Another negative is there is NO on or OFF option...you have to unplug to turn it off-not sure if it's damaging to the device or not?On the plus side, it has strong illumination and perfect for my 3gallon mini reef!"
4,A Useful Reader,"In my recent study of sociology, I read this book for a Race, Class, and Gender course. It provided supplemental information to a course that helped students develop an understanding of the constructs of race, class, and gender in a modern society. The reader provided a cultural mix of authors on broad topics concerning race, class, and gender as they pertain to American Society today. I would highly reccomend this book, as it has helped me not only in my undergraduate studies, but it will continue to help as I begin writing a thesis on how race, class, and gender effect the socialization of America's children."
5,A Very Satisfying Read,"Author Britto need not fear a malpractice suit for his writing skills. This is a well written mystery whichenlightens the reader on a number of fronts, including the pursuit and collecting of art pottery. Britto's writing skill is such that he imbeds the information in the reader's mind, creating a desire to learn more about art pottery independently. Maybe author Britto is really a transplant surgeon, not a plastic surgeon! Let's hear more from this author, and soon"
5,Great product!!!,"So just a note. MAKE sure you know the length of the desired cable. Trying to guestimate the amount you need is lazy. actually bust out a measuring tape and check to make sure you always have the right amount of cable needed. That said, This product is legit! Ordered two 5 ft. 12 gauge 1/4in. speaker cables. Super HEAVY DUTY!!! works great!"
4,"Douglas Adams meets Iain Banks' ""the Culture""","I enjoy the style of both authors, and found that Simon Bucher-Jones did well in providing a story with both humorous and thought-provoking societal and science elements."
3,O.K. for beginners...,"I used this book in a Networking Essentials class that I took at a local college. This book is good for someone who has little experience and wants to learn about the various aspects of networking, or maybe for someone who has experience and needs a refresher on broad based concepts. But despite the book's title, Network+ Guide to Networks should NOT be your one-stop shop if you are looking to pass the Network+ exam. CompTia's Network+ test is rather detail oriented, and Network+ Guide to Networks is just too broad in scope to be effective (I passed with an 875 out of 900, but I had prior networking experience and I used some third-party software to help me prepare). It almost seems like they started this book with networking 'essentials' in mind, but then stamped Network+ on the cover at the last minute in order to generate some additional sales. All-in-all, not a bad book, but it's just not up to task for the demands of the Network+ exam."
1,Poorly Edited,"There are review questions at the end of each chapter. I have progressed through Chapter 11 to date. Every single review section contains questions that cannot be answered by information in the text. Replies from the publisher revealed that needed information was deleted in the editing process. Their suggestion was to buy the next edition. (Customer service at its best, eh?) My suggestion is to skip this book altogether and find a better edited Networking Fundamentals guide."
2,Not accurate,"I'm studying for the Network+ Exam. The book has a lot of inaccuracies. Careful if you are using this box as a study guide. I recommend Exam Cram 2 - much better. About 1 in every 15 review questions is either mis-guiding, improperly stated or just plain wrong. I give it about 2.5 stars."
1,Mr. Jones was TO GENEROUS,"After spending eight weeks in a Diablo Valley Junior College class, and mastering every stinking detail of this dreadful book, I failed Network+ today. There were many, many things on the test that I have never heard of. Including: NAT, several arcane TCP/IP subprotocalls, h"
3,Eh......too many stories for me,"There were too many stories from his time as pastor for my liking. However, part of my frustration with that is the fact that I am so busy with two different school programs and reading that I just want information and then to move on."
5,Great Book for new Pastors.,"Great book by Joe Stowell.I am a new pastor, and I greatly appreciate his insight, his perspective, and his words of wisdom.5 stars."
4,very informative,"informative, but not highly readable. Its worded very much like a textbook. But the information within is solid. It covers almost all the basic elements of entrepreneurship. I think its a great stepping stone for someone who knows nothing about starting his/her own business. From vc's to ipo's, its all in this book. But unless your going to start a business any time soon, it may be too specific. Either way, knowledge is power baby!"
4,Suits the Needs,These will suit my needs. Shipping was very fast and the item is nice. I would like to have seen a book with more receipts instead of having only 50 to a book.
2,Not worth your time,"This book is not nearly as interesting, enriching, or well written as the other books in this series. (I highly recommend the Voyage of the Beagle by Darwin, for example.) Publishing a whole volume of Ledyard is really overkill, and misstates his importance as a writer and historian. While the 20-page account of Cook's murder and the, er, unpalatable aftermath of his death is riveting, the rest of Ledyard's journal is dull. The private letters that make up the latter half of the book have little of interest to the general reader. For much better travel adventure about the same regions that Ledyard covers here, read Darwin (see above), or the Mutiny on the Bounty trilogy by Nordhoff and Hall, or Farley Mowat (especially The Siberians)."
5,Donnie Darko book,The item came on time and as described. I don't know what else I can possibly say about the product . Have a nice day and GO PATRIOTS !!!!
4,The Donnie Darko Book Review,"I really wanted to buy this book after having watched the movie (which was incredible btw). I didn't manage to read the book so far, i just thumbed through it and it has a lot of images and some nice interviews + the actual script of the movie. As for the quality, you can hardly say it has been used.So, all in all, everything is ok. Thanks Amazon :)"
1,Wish I Hadn't Bought It,"The Storage Central Gigabit unit is very nice looking and super easy to install drives (the front plate just slides off, slide the SATA drive in, put the front plate back on). However, as others have noted, it's not really a NAS device since every computer has to have the CD drivers installed in order to use it. It doesn't show up in your network folder and is totally invisible to your network computers, depending solely on it's on software. Besides that negative, it is not that fast. I have a gigabit adapter on my computer, a gigabit switch, and a gigabit router and it took 2 days (really, 2 days) to transfer around 300mb to it. I wanted it to put songs and movies on it and let everyone in my home with a computer use it when they wanted. It's just not up to it. My computer with it's gigabit NIC works great for that purpose, the SC101T doesn't. Again, it's just too slow and apparently does not achieve gigabit speeds from my point of view. I wish I had never purchased it."
1,Does not work with Vista (64 Bit),"This device does not work with 64 bit Vista, despite what Netgear advertises. Netgear is rather silent about this and does not even claim to have any 64 bit drivers in the works.I'm returning it."
3,Product good - Software poor,"I'm giving the SC101T a 3 out of 5 since the hardware itself is quite nice, but the software provided by Netgear is very poor. Setting up the drive and using it with various SATA drives is a snap. The trouble starts when using Netgear's required software. The developers apparently do not consult with end users when making the interface since even in Wizard-mode it is not intuitive, making the process of getting a drive formatted and mounted a real trick if your desired setup is anything other than plain vanilla. The help file doesn't go into much depth other than walking you through what the Wizard was already showing onscreen. If Netgear had better software, I'd give this a 5 out of 5 easily. But forcing the use of the included software in order to access the drive is a definite strike against the SC101T. Once I had things up and running though, my experience has been positive."
3,"Good, but live is better.","The songs are good, and Matthew Puckett's voice is perfect for them. ""Goldfish"", with its quirky lyrics and chant-like melody is easily the best song. But hearing them live is something else...he can make a dark, badly-lit room shine like a stage."
4,A STRONG AND FULLFILLING ALBUM FROM BEGINNING TO END,"THE ALBUM IS THOUROUGHLY ENJOYABLE, BUT I'VE SEEN THEM PERFORM LIVE AND THE ALBUM DOES NOT QUITE SHOW HOW GREAT THEY REALLY ARE. LIVE MATHEW PUCKETT GIVES A STRONG PERFORMANCE AND SHOWS HIS PASSION FOR MUSIC."
5,Great for stereo to mono,"This cable takes a mono XLR external mic and puts the mono signal on both the left and right stereo channels of your camcorder that has a 3.5 mm stereo mic input. I use this to connect my Azden shotgun mic (Azden Barrell Shotgun Mic With XLR Outputs), and other XLR type mics to my Canon Vixia HF 200 and HF 20 camcorders. Works great."
3,Decent adapter,"It's a pretty good item, I'm just failing to see how people aren't mentioning it not actually being a foot long. What I got was half that size."
2,Not working with TM300,"HOSA XLR (F) - 3.5mm Tip/Ring/Sleeve, (wired for dual mono), 1 ft. Didn't work at wall with my TM300 and Audio Techinca shotgun. Sound was very weak. Got instead Pearstone low to high impedance, works perfect!"
5,(4th Edition Hardback) Excellent,"(I'm reviewing the 4th Edition Hardcover) This atlas maps and details an astonishing number of facts about Oklahoma. There's something for everyone: political (e.g. ""Constitutional Convention Delegate Districts, 1906"" , geologilcal (""Geologic Formations), biological (""Buffalo Country""), military (""Civil War Battlesites, 1861-1865""), and this sampling barely scratches the surface: my use of the word 'astonishing' wasn't mere hyperbole. Each subject has about a page's worth of explanatory text and maps of excellent quality. One of the strongest themes in the book involves the indian populations of the state: there are numerous pages, from ""Early Arrivals, 40,000-12,000 BC""/""Early Big-Game Hunters, 12,000-8,000 BC"" to the ""Proposed State of Sequoyah, 1905"", with meticulous maps of the various indian territories in-between, as they were created and modified over the years. This is a great book for any Oklahoman: The authors, and OU Press, have done a very fine job."
4,oklahoma,I bought this book as a gift for someone. They seemed to be pleased with it. I have not read it
5,If Doctor Who could meet anyone in the Universe...,"I would want it to be Killashandra Ree.What a strong female character. Sure, she starts out as being a bit of a brat, but her character grows and matures throughout the series into a wonderfully strong, independent and competent person. This is still one of my favorite sci-fi collections. The concept of Ballybran Crystal and a job as a ""cutter"" was just so inspired. When I was younger I SO wanted to go to Ballybran."
4,Classic book,"I've loved this book/series for years. I reread it every couple of years. Looked for an audio version to no avail, had to get the kindle vernon."
3,Above average.,"Well, not in the least a bad story, but I've read better. This is just my opinion, and I don't believe that others have to share it with me. Any Anne McCaffrey fan like myself should read it. You never know, you might love it...."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A woman is a talented singer, however she is not good enough to be the best there is, so she gets a bit grumpy.So, she goes and takes a job as a crystal miner on another planet, where, for some reason, the ability to sing in perfect pitch is a very useful ability.The book really isn't as dumb as that sounds, though.The crystal they mine is a valued and important technological resources."
1,The Worst Book in the World,"If I could give this book zero stars, I would. Believe me. Crystal Singer is filled with an anti-climatic plot, one dimensional characters, and predictability. Killashandra has no personality - she just is because McCaffrey willed her to be - and neither do any of the other putrid characters that step across the stage in this book. The plot has a beginning...but no middle...and no end. McCaffrey attempts some climax - in the Crystal Ranges, the installion of Crystal - but the story is just so predictable (of course we ALL know she's going to become a Crystal Singer. That's what ALWAYS happens in this type of plot) that any attempt at writing something exciting or worthwhile or even profound falls short of even McCaffrey (and she certainly is an excellent writer, don't get me wrong. But her dragon books are better)All in all, this book is a labor to get through, and not a worthwhile read at all."
5,Chrystal Singer,I have been an Anne McCaffrey (and Todd McCaffrey) fan for many years. It is interesting to come into closer contact with them with this book.
5,Crystal singer,This was the first book of Anne Mccaffrey's that I ever read. It opened a whole new universe of imagination for me. great read!
5,Excellent series!,"The crstal singer is the first of the trilogy and an excellent book by itself. i loved the characters and the new ideas, as well as the originality of the planet and its cristals. Alive and exciting - the sequals are equaly good."
2,Item will worn contrary to its description,"No complaints about the type of book. It did not meet the description. It is in fair condition, discolored, and cracked. Readable yes, but just barely."
3,Monster needs to repackage this...,"After I received this product I was a little surprised to see how this cable was packaged. The way that the cable is placed in its packaging caused a kink in the cable. This is a little bit of a concern for a fiber optic cable since light needs to travel on a straight path and any kinks in the cable can affect sound quality. Monster Cable should know this better than most and Im surprised their quality control hasnt caught or corrected the packaging faux paus (sp?). I was eventually able to straighten the cable after repeated attempts of bending the cable in the opposite direction. But this is not a good idea either as it may cause further problems for some people if theyre not careful enough. Anyway, after I straightened it out and plugged it in, it seemed to work fine. Overall, the quality of the cable is good, it was just irritating to see a kink in a fiber optic cable after unpackaging it."
2,Xbox 360 Monster Cable Fiber Optic Cable,This is a required purchase if you bought the Monster Cable VGA cable or component cable for the 360 and you want digital audio. They have a custom jack on the side of their component or VGA cable that requires an adapter unlike the Microsoft ones that have a standard Toslink jack. Buying their optical cable is only way to buy the adapter. Fortunately the prices are reasonable and for the price of a standard cable you get the adapter jack for free. Basically its a way for them to make more money off of you because there really is not a necessity for this. Its rumored that the older adapter that comes with Toslink cable for the original Xbox also works with this jack.
1,Totally Predictable,"I've read enough Red Dress books to know that I shouldn't expect a masterpiece. I enjoy reading these books while commuting and to relax at night after a long day. For the most part these books have served their purpose but I have to say that Dating Without Novicaine was bordering on insulting. When I read the back of the book I was intrigued by the Oregon setting. Working in the dot com industry I'm all too familiar with the Portland techie types and I thought it would be refreshing to get a slice of life beyond NYC. I swear that on Page 4, if not sooner, I knew who Hannah was going to end up with. I mean at least try to throw us off a tad. There were definitely some funny moments but all in all this book doesn't have much going for it, compared with the others in its genre. Up till now I've been a loyal Red Dress reader but any more books like this and I'll have to cut the cord. Oh well."
2,Dating Without Novacaine was a Numbing Experience,"I was drawn to this book because it featured a main character, Hannah O'Dowd, who lived somewhere other than New York or London. Even more appealing was the fact that she had nothing to do with the publishing industry. And I found her dental phobia kind of endearing.Unfortunately, as I delved deeper into this book, its charm began to fade. I found the author's style flat, with too much reliance on tired cliches. While there were some funny moments I found that they lacked originality. I found this to be the book's major flaw. Content-wise, the book is for adults, but it reads like a Sweet Valley High novel from a stylistic point of view.I realize that the writers of ""chick lit"" do not aspire to be Kate Chopin. However there are many books in this genre that manage to be light and clever and well-written. Dating Without Novacaine does not fall into this category."
1,lacking creativity,"Granted, the market is currently oversaturated with books on single women and 20-30 somethings, but that is all the more reason to expect a twist to go with this catchy title.I found this book disapointing at best. It did not provoke a reader's ""high"" with a creative or developing storyline. The ending was so predictable within the first 20 pages, that the rest of the book was on autopilot. If I hadn't paid for the book I wouldn't have finished it."
4,Charming Book,"I really enjoyed reading about Hannah's dating adventures. I found myself laughing quite a few times. Almost 30, Hannah realizes it is time to find ""Mr. Right,"" so she develops a plan to find him. I thought the characters were well-developed and not the ""fluffy"" friends you normally find in chick lit books. Although I foresaw how it was going to end, I still enjoyed it."
2,Don't Judge a Book By its Title,"The title is the reason I bought this book. I expected it to be much more entertaining than it actually was. I was quite disappointed. Although there were a couple of times it did make me laugh out loud, it ended up being quite predictable. Also, I was very disappointed in the ending."
3,Entertaining Weekend Read,"I didn't find the story amazing, but it was a fun, breezy read with some good laughs and a few surprisingly profound observations on dating and trying to find ""the one"". A nice read for the beach or a weekend away maybe."
3,Good Read for the Train or Plane,"Obviously one of a now very popular ""Bridget Jones"" type genre, this book is very sweet and an easy read. Not particularly demanding of the reader, this book is easy light reading when one needs to pass time waiting for something, either arrival at your destination or whatever."
2,It wouldn't take Sherlock Holmes....,"....to figure out the ending to this book...I felt like my intelligence was insulted! Up until now, I have loved all the Red Dress Ink books, but this one was sub-par. It seemed like it was written for grade schoolers! I like a little maturity with the books I read."
4,"Fun, down to earth","I disagree with the negative reviews of this book. I've read several Red Dress Ink books, and I thought that this was one of the most down to earth of the ones that I've read. I also thought that it was nice to finally read about someone who wasn't involved in publishing or advertising (like the protagonists in most of the other Red Dress Ink novels). Hannah, the main character, runs her own tailoring business. It's about time that they showed a woman running her own show! I do wish that Lisa Cach elaborated on this aspect a bit more. Overall, though, it was heartwarming."
4,Dating Without Novocaine,"This is a very good, easy reading book. I would recommend it for someone who just needs a quick fun book to get through a dull weekend. The ending is kinda given away in the middle. At the minimum a person could guess who the main character ends up with."
5,Over the top? Definitely!,"Jay's dad loves his projects, and his summer project for this year is a deck and rotisserie. Well, his dad doesn't do anything in a small way, and it's off to the Hardware Supermax story to get everything (and it's a lot!) that they need. It's one adventure after another for the Lenos, and nothing goes the way you would expect.I see the review that criticizes this book for being ""over the top."" Well, it's true, this book is goofy and outrageous and over the top - just the way my little reader likes her books! Combining silly illustrations with this over the top story, the book is very funny and is sure to please those little ones who like goofy humor (like Spongebob or Loony Tunes or Ed, Edd and Eddie). My little reader really enjoys this book, and that's good enough for me!"
1,Terrible. Good bed time story if your child is an insomniac.,"My child hated this book. Although, he did fall asleep rather quickly after reading it and complained about how boring it was.Not recommended. Don't be fooled, [...]"
5,Great cheat sheet before job interview for software engineer,"I love it because this book helped me with winning job in 2008. I was laid off and have been looking for new job and this book helped me with refreshing my knowledge about C language, which I learned in university 20 years ago. I was great at job interviews so I get good job."
4,Good coverage of C and standard library,"This is a concise reference to the C language, plus a nice, useful summary of the standard library. Definitely a nice supplement for learning C and/or a handy reference once you know C."
5,GOOD SIMPLE REFERENCE!!!,"This pocket reference is good to have while you are learning the C programming language. You need some C experience to follow it, but it is not to demanding if you know a little C it is a good supplement to the book you are learning C with.NOTE: There are a few typos in the book the cooks website lists the corrections on its confirmed errata page.I recomend, ""C All-In-One for Dummies"", by Dan Gookin for a beginner to learn C."
4,organization for clutter maniacs,"This planner is great. I am somewhat organizationaly challenged and this thing holds all my weird little slips of paper in place until I can get home, unload it and enter the info to my computer or address book or whatever.However, I am only giving it four stars as I don't know what the future will bring. I've had it less than a year and the zipper already seems to be getting a little maimed. However, most of these things aren't meant to be packed to the gills or thrown about the way this one has been."
1,Not what pictured.,"So disappointed. Ordered as a Christmas gift and even though it is described as ""mini,"" I did not expect it to be as mini as it was. The mouth is not red as pictured, but grey, and in the photo it appears he has actual eyes - there is a barely visible line of white fabric that you can hardly see, so it doesn't even appear he has eyes. Should have splurged on the big one. This one looks like it came out of the bin at the dollar store, even though I paid $13.15 for it."
4,Perfect for Valentines day,"The plush arrived in time for Valentines day. All in all the quality is not bad, the only negative point i would make is the teeth / mouth interior... on mine the teeth was made of a floppy fabric - yet the claws on hands and feet where stitched white leather... most odd. Also the mouth was not the bright red you see in the picture.However it made the perfect Valentines day gift."
4,Your kid is able to sleep with Godzilla now!,"My son still sleeps with this..he tried sleeping with his vinyl figures, but as you can imagine, that can prove a bit difficult & uncomfortable if he accidentally rolls on top of it (yeoch). This is pillow soft & is fantastically crafted!"
1,Terrible.,"I left a longer comment on the 3-star review above titled ""eh...""I'm terribly disappointed with this purchase. Don't waste your money."
1,Way too expensive!,I thought this thing would have been bigger considering the price. It is tiny and not nearly as detailed as the picture in the advert. Complete waste of time and money.
5,My 8-year-old son loves it!,"My son is in a HUGE Godzilla phase. He wanted this plush so he could videotape/reenact his own Godzilla scenes. As a parent, I think it's just another stuffed animal... however, my son would highly disagree ;)"
1,Picture is incorrect!,This is a cheap knockoff of Godzilla. The picture shown here I notice keeps changing. I received a horrible looking dinosaur. Keep far from this cheap product. This shouldn't even be sold on Amazon.
2,Good image quality; mechanically deficient,"Set up is smooth and easy, scan quality is very good. Forget about that 25 seconds per frame thing, however. On a slow computer a hi-res scan might take up to 14 minutes; on a new computer the same scan took only 4 minutes, with most of the enhancement options turned on.Carrier locks up between frames frequently, however, which renders the batch scanning mode useless. It's been back to the factory twice now -- they've had it longer than I have.Might be better to wait for the next model, when hopefully they'll have the mechanics worked out."
4,very happy with the scanner,"I researched and thought about buying a scanner for months. I read so many different reviews and internet postings that I became paralyzed, unable to make a decision. I thought for a while that I wanted a flatbed scanner that could scan slides and negatives. Then I read about this scanner and it sounded good for me as I only have 35mm slides and negatives to scan. I plan on buying an inexpensive flat bed to scan the few flat prints and art that I need scanned. For me the software is easy to use and seems to do a great job. I installed the software on my machine with Microsoft XP as per the instructions and was scanning slides in a matter of moments.I read reviews stating the the software was not that good, but for what my needs are, it has worked very well. This scanner is not cheap, but I didn't mind paying a little extra for a quality machine. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,"Great hardware, somewhat buggy software","I really like the quality of the scans from the Dimage Elite 5400 II. I primarily use it to scan slides, though it can scan negatives as well. The unit itself is small, quiet, and elegant in its simplicity. The software, however, leaves a lot to be desired. It has 4 modes, the most useful of which is batch scanning. When the software works, it pretty much is painless- start it up and do other things till done. However, the software sometimes quits with no warning on my Macintosh Dual G5. Unfortunately, this results in having to restart the computer. No kernal panic, but the scanner simply will not work without a reboot. This can be frustrating.The package comes with Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0, for both Mac and PC. The scanner software also comes ready for Mac and PC. I think this was a great bundle for the price. If the scanning software had been better I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Works with OSX Intel,"Just a note to potential buyers -- it works fine with OSX and Intel. The Mac software isn't fantastic, but it works and is straightfoward. The scan quality is great. I'm quite happy with the purchase.NOTE: The USB support is flaky with the included software. Try VueScan -- it's been a lot more consistent for me."
5,title,"This scanner was definately a deal. The resolution is great and the software is very easy to install and use. The two different masks make it so you can scan negatives and slides. The slide mask allows you to load 5 slides at a time instead of scanning them one at a time. It took a little longer to arrive than I had expected, but it was well worth the wait."
1,a poor product,I'm a professional photographer. I decided to purchase a new scanner. I'd previously used a Nikon LS 2000 for about 5 years without any hardware problems. I decided to buy a new film scanner and purchased this product on July 17. The film transport froze after about 20 scans. It was replaced with a new scanner that had the same problem. I was advised that if I attempted to remove my valuable film strip the guarantee would be void. A defective scanner and an unconcerned Minolta. Be prepared to lose your film.
1,DON'T ORDER THESE IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM.,"I thought these were the greatest pair of earrings in the world when I received them. They are a perfect size, and not too dressy. I got a pair of these at Christmas, and lost one within a few weeks. I thought it was me. My daughter gave them to me, so I ordered another set to replace the lost one. It has also gone missing in the house twice. I am looking at getting some sort of guard made. The clasp doesn't work very well at all."
3,Adequate entry in a strong series,"Volume 21 of the ""Have a Nice Day"" series gives a strong nod to the latter end of the decade, but oddly short-shrifts the single most significant sub-genre of the time. Meco's lively interpretation of the ""Star Wars Theme"" is one of a very few disco or disco-like cuts included in the 25-volume set.Bonnie Tyler's ""It's a Heartache"" is a true golden nugget and joins Warren Zevon's ""Werewolves of London"" and Exile's ""Kiss You All Over"" as the headliners of a rather inconsistent dozen. However, this is one of only a couple Volumes in the set that does justice to the late seventies, and that makes it worth having."
2,Please Stop....,"Another stuid comp from this series that makes no sense. Why would you put Ram Jam and Warren Zevon side by side with the likes of David Gates,Dan Hill and Player? It's an insult to Warren as far as I'm concerned and pretty much renders this volume useless despite the fact that there are some mediocre b-grade one hit wonders here......"
5,A blast from the past,"Who can forget all those great one-hit wonders from during and immediately after the Saturday Night Fever/Star Wars era? Now, a whole bunch of them are collected on one disc, including some stuff you have probably forgotten all about but will remember instantly once you hear it.I do have to wonder though why Rhino gave disco music the short end of the stick in the ""Have a Nice Day"" series. There are a lot of songs that would definitely have fit in this collection that were not included...Foxy's ""Get Off"", LTD's ""Back in Love Again"", Odyssey's ""Native New Yorker"", Peter Brown's ""Dance With Me"" all come to mind. Still, you can only fit so much on one CD, and this one still rates five stars. Highly recommended."
5,Back to origins,"This is a book full on knowledge, that tempts you into a thirst for more. You can almost feel the peices described and imagine the surroundings of ancient times. After reading the book I had a strong earge to go back to basics' and follow the ancient ways with new enllightement. Many thanks to Paul."
4,BumbleBee Infant Costume,"I fell in love with this costume right away! Ordered it immediately. I do have to say I was a little disappointed with the flimsy headpiece. The antlers weren't even attached so I went out and bought a gluegun to fix it. Also, I must've been so excited about this costume I didn't even realize it didn't have sleeves or leggings. So I also had to buy tights and a black onsie for my daughter to wear underneath. Price was good, but shipping fees were ridiculous! Very cute costume, overall happy with purchase and my daughter looked adorable!"
3,Drive Belt Pulley,"The pulley is made well but the reason I gave it 3 stars is that the spacer on the old pulley was to large and i had to use a washer instead.So i guess it is not a direct fit oem part,it is probaely the second design that would work so be carefull when you order this part"
2,disappointed,Sent this as a gift and they liked it but the bear did not work. Can't exchange it for another due to the amazon exchange policy that says it will only exchange if it is because of their packaging error. Too bad. Wish it played Happy Birthday as that was the whole point.
4,Birthday Treat,This plush bday cake and treats is adorable! Even made it into our daughters first birthday pictures we had professionally done!
2,the bear doesn't sing,"I bought this for my little boy. Everything is cute, but unfortunately the baby bear never worked, so it never played the happy birthday song. This was previosuly reported by another customer. Too bad!"
1,Will the real Kid Rock please stand up?,"Okay, I'm gonna be fair. This isn't the real Kid Rock. This isn't Kid Rock's label. Kid Rock would never let something like this get released if it were up to him. So it's only a matter of time until...what? The rock artist Kid Rock had nothing to do with this cd? Now that's what I call grand theft identity. (No, I'm so stupid I have no idea that grand theft identity doesn't exist. Bottom line, I doubt these songs would sound like anything Kid Rock would make.)"
1,This book is an insult to intelligent hard of seeing people,"This dictionary is a disappointment to people who have trouble reading normal print dictionaries. With half the number of entries of other dictionaries, no pronunciation key for entries, no etymology and extremely bare bones definitions, this dictionary is completely useless. I wish that the publishers would issue a large print dictionary in as many volumes as would be necessary to contain all the information of a standard print dictionary. My eyes are bad but my brain is fine."
3,The dictionary did not have a lot of the definition.,I rated this dictionary a 3 star because it did not have a lot of words that I was looking for.
1,Missing from the box!,"I bought the crossword / hangman game at an office supply store, it was very inexpensive. Problem is there was no hangman! There was a CD ROM with a crossword puzzle program, as well as a puzzle program, neither of which contain hangman. Disappointing! I mainly bought it for hangman to have students use in their free time. I went to the website (www.cosmi.com I think it was) and couldn't find anything on hangman. OH well. Made me mad so I figured I'd go here and get my revenge with a negative review."
1,Unastounding Sounds Unamazing Music,"As a huge fan of the Hawkwind of the mid 70s, I awaited this release eagerly: the idea of hearing tracks from 'Astounding Sounds, Amazing Music'(one of Hawkwind's most underrated records) in a live context was more than a little exciting.Boy was I disappointed. The sound quality of this recording is of the standard of a poor bootleg - if you're expecting something like the quality of the live cuts on 'PXR5' for example, you'll be pretty upset.There is still room for a definitive live release from this period featuring such masters of the universe as Turner, Calvert, Brock and House together, but I'm afraid this is not it. Avoid."
5,Star Wars,"Groovy. War at their laid-back best, a lost gem from a galaxy far, far away. 1977 was still a good year for music and all things Star Wars. I actually think this is one of their better albums. Very easy on the ears."
5,beautiful but,when will i have the time to make these cakes. some look so outdated. duh i should have known. but i love Collete Peters and am glad to have one of her books.
5,interesting range of drumming tacks,"I am selling a copy. No info on this site, so here are the track descriptions from the liner notes: 1) talking drum music from Ghana; 2) village music digitally recorded in Senegal; 3) Sabar drumming from Senegal; 4) Santeria drumming from NYC; 5) Haitian sacred drumming; 6) Ghanian xylophone music; 6) Ghanian village drumming."
1,Disappointing,"Noah Feldman's book amounts to a restatement of arguments made in the '90s by one of his apparent mentors, John Esposito, who argues thatIslamists should be allowed to win elections. The trouble is, most Muslims in the Arab Middle East disagree with them, particularly women, who stand to suffer the most under the rule of clerics. Although I disagree with Feldman's argument, my main gripe with the book is its striking lack of originality. One might as well go to the source and read books by Esposito and Akbar Ahmed."
1,Outdated and mostly irrelevant,"I found the book to be outdated with much of the information irrelevant to the current state of technology and markets. It gets one star for at least having some basic info on classis technology. Even with that, it's not even a good paper weight. This is the first Amazon book that I returned."
4,Good Introduction,"A well written book on cell phones. Cell phone plans and services are changing as we speak now, but kudos to the authors for taking the difficult task of describing the services. If you find the cell phone plans and services confusing, this book is a good start. Without getting too much technical, the book describes the technical aspects of wireless technology in a easy-to-understand language. The FAQ was particularly useful.[...]"
2,Mythos - 'Concrete City' (Spalax),"Originally released in 1979,as this was the band's fourth record.I liked two of their earlier works better,their 1971 self-titled debut and 'Strange Guys'(see my reviews of both).'Concrete City' is simply too artsy-fartsy/progressive for me.CD has six tracks,as the only two that managed to hold my full attention were ""Flamenco Bay"" and ""Neutron Bomb"" that features a bit of the early Mytho's vibe.Just might possibly appeal to some fans of Focus,Curved Air,Eloy and Nektar.Pretty much for completists."
1,Pure Boredom,"This is the second Philip Shelby book I have attempted to read, the first being ""Days of Drums."" These books were so dull and poorly written, I found my attention wandering. I was unable to complete ""Last Rights"" because it was so boring and returned it to a bookstore. I didn't even ask for my money back. I just dropped it off and ""donated"" it to them. I can never throw a book out...no matter how bad it is. Dull, dull, dull."
2,Just Fair,"After reading Shelby's very good first thriller, Days Of Drums, I was somewhat disappointed in Last Rights. I found the story started out with a lot of excitement but soon dragged -- and continued to do so for much too long a stretch. The last quarter generated excitement once again but by that point I had pretty much stopped caring about the outcome. The greatest thrill for me was coming to the final page so I could move on to my next book. Shelby's writing style holds your interest, but this ""thriller"", while fairly fast-paced, turned out to be much too predictable and, thus, not very thrilling. I was especially looking forward to reading this book after reading some of the earlier reader reviews. However, as you can see, my reading experience with Last Rights differed from theirs. Now, if you're in the mood for a good thriller in the same vein, try David Hackworth's The Price Of Honor."
5,I liked it,"Plain and simple, I liked this book. Another, at least for me, page turner. I haven't read anything else written by P. Shelby, but I just might, because he impressed me.As simple as that."
1,Serves my purpose,"Nice to be able to get extenders to make necklaces more comfortable to wear. I have a short, chubby neck and most necklaces come too short for me."
3,These are ok,"Needed to extend a necklace that was too short- these work fine. My hair is long so it covers up the extension in the back. They are ""ok"" quality."
1,unless you buy it for a similar chain in design and size...very noticeable,chains are large and when you put on the extender it does move around and you have to always adjust it moving it in the back. It's also very obvious when you wear it if it turns around i mean unless you are extending it with exactly the same type of chain and size. i return it.
1,"Poor quality, overpriced shipping",These are very poor quality. Can't even open two of them. Shipping was $4.99 but the stamp on the envelope was $0.88. Don't waste you time or money on these.
1,Green jewelry,I purchased the entire offer of the 3 types of length in both silver and gold. I wore the longest silver chain for 4 days and it turned dark gray then it turned green. Same for the longest gold chain. Will not buy from this company again. Don't make the same mistake.
1,Cheap,"Terrible! I used a gold one on one of my necklaces, it turned blackish green in no time at all. I don't recommend them."
3,"GOOD QUALITY, ONLY USEFUL FOR HEAVIER NECKLACES","I usually wear light necklaces, and these extensions because of their being relatively heavier than my necklaces pulled the whole necklace back and created a funny situation in which the extender was not on the back of my neck anymore, but standing way lower, dragging the front of the necklace up to my neck, making it look even shorter than it was in the first place.If you wear heavier necklaces with somewhat heavy pendents I guess you'll be fine though."
3,did not receive what was shown.,"I received 6 silver extensions instead of 3 silver, 3 gold.I kept them because it was better than nothing. But, I would have liked to receive gold ones as well."
3,No gold tone,"I received the extenders, and they work fine. The problem was they were all silver tone instead of three gold tone and three silver tone. I do not need duplicates of the same color."
1,Disappointed,"I am so sorry to say that these were a disaster.Every one broke immediately.I have no desire to be mean,but really,an inferior product. It arrived on time but I am disappointed with the product."
1,I had high hopes,"I was so excited when I got these, but they did not perform well. While it made my necklace the perfect length, after one day of wear the ""gold"" wore off and it turned an ugly dark color. Now I can't wear the necklace unless I have a collar on. I am now looking for an actual gold extender."
2,Not a Match,Was looking for a chain extender for my chain necklace. These were to flimsy and they weren't a close enough match.
3,Not bad,The extensions work well. The only downside is that the chains are thin and so has a very small clasp that is hard to handle.
4,nice product,I have bought these twice now and they are a good product. Easy to use and the different sizes help.
4,Practical extenders,quick shipment; good functional chain extenders; chains could be a little more delicate but still good for what is needed
1,Would not recommend,"I have 2 necklaces that I bought on Etsy that were a little short so I bought this set to make them a little longer. I put the 2"" (gold) extension on and it looked great, but an hour later I felt my neck and the necklace was gone! Thankfully I ended up finding it, but when I looked at it closely I could see that the clasp on the extender didn't close fully and the eye of the necklace chain slipped off the extender. I would rather wear the necklaces too short than risk losing them all together again."
3,not all worked,..the clasp will not budge on one of the extenders...its the longer gold one hoping i wont need it..wish seller would had made sure all pieces where working before shipped.shipping was quick though.
3,Partial Satisfaction,"While I was successful in using some of the extenders for my jewelry one or two of them were so ""delicate"" that they broke and were unusable. The price was very low, but I would have paid more to have quality and usability for this purpose."
3,"For the price, not bad.","Everything arrived promptly and as described/shown. The seller charging for shipping on something that was post-marked under a dollar didn't sit too well though. Other than that, these do the job I need them to. I'll post again if the extenders or my skin turn green! For the price, not bad. I would love to find these in 10K or 14K gold for a reasonable price, but these will due for now."
3,Quality isn't there ... but what do you want for the price!,"I needed to purchase these extenders for my wedding necklace. I only needed the gold tone, but wanted several sizes to choose from. The extender worked fine, and was sturdy enough to last the night."
4,Nice extenders,"This set of necklace/bracelet extenders have done the job for me. I have purchased several necklaces but they all came with chains about 3 - 6 inches too short for how I wanted to wear them with my different tops. With three different lengths, I am able to change the length of my necklaces to fit each top. This is a nice set."
3,yay!,"elf power is fun and frivolous, like sweet sodapop! a shame they're fronted by a squeaky eunuch with one favorite note!"
4,"Not as great as ""when the reed king comes"" but good anyway",First is was a little disapointet. but i lisentet to it for days an it became better and better. The song about jane is the best song.
2,One of those dreams you can't remember when you wake up,"For every one Elephant 6 band that is good, there are two that give the collective a bad name. Elf Power fits into the latter category.A lot is made of the ""new psychedelic renaissance,"" with Elephant 6 leading the way. But this stuff wouldn't even pass muster for '60s b-sides, let alone start any sort of musical renaissance. The instrumentation is psychedelic cuteness in the worst way, the lead singer can't sing worth a nickel (and seems to hit the same darn note in just about every song), and the band can't write catchy melodies to save their lives either. This band also takes ""tweeness"" farther than any band I've heard since The Three O'Clock -- and I thought the lead guy in THAT band sounded like a little girl.This is one elf-powered offering you can do without, take my word for it. Check out the Olivia Tremor Control, Green Pajamas, Lilys, or even the Essex Green."
2,Not the Elephant 6 I love,"I am a slavish devotee to the Elephant 6 Collective, but I may have to rethink that after listening to this release of Elf Power's. Maybe I didn't give it the time it needed to grow on me, but I can honestly say this album grated on me more than any album I have listened to this year (and I listen to a lot). It was just too sparse. Most of the tracks seemed to lack a melodic center. And the words just bounced off of me. For my money, you would be much better off with Olivia Tremor Control, The Apples in Stereo, or Beulah. Even the Red King is to be preferred to this one.I know people have rated this album off the charts, but I just have to say that it really does not do it for me. Let this be a voice of warning and/or dissent."
2,This album will get you beat up at school!,"I saw them live in New Orleans. They were awful. They opened for Wilco, what an embarassment for the Chicago natives. I lived in Athens just long enough to realize that this is the sort of poser music that only Athens can produce. I almost fell into the trap of thinking these guys were worth a crap until it dawned on me - this is the type of music that will get you beat up in school. // The tracks on this album are whiney boy pop rock, aspiring for something which I don't really seem to know...I don't think they do either - so, ""hey! lets call it ART!!! They'll be sure to buy it then..."" - Don't get caught wasting your money."
4,Nice to be introduced to Mr. Ranglin!!,"Well, for me this was an introduction to Ernest Ranglin's music. I first heard the cut ""Nyah"" on satellite radio, and felt I had to know more. I soon copped this album, and was not disappointed. The majority of the mixes are found to be pleasant, and stays in fine tune with calypso and island jazz. I was an immediate fan from the first track, and started searching for more albums. Unfortunately, I found it hard to find Ernest's other albums in the local stores other than Surfin', but the music is worth checking for. For one who enjoys this style, I recommend Ernest's version of Bob Marley tunes as well. A legend I regret finding so late."
5,"The life of a true warrior, on and off the battlefield","Hack loved the Army and loved his country, and this comes through every page and word in this lengthy autobiography. There is so much information contained in the over 800 pages, spaning the life on an Infantryman from the Merchant Marine in the final stages of WWII until his retirement after his last Vietnam tour in 1971, that probably everybody will find something to like and/or dislike. He chose to tell his story in detail and with a clear aim, and he succeeded. If you serve(ed) in the Armed Forces, this book is a required reading and will give you plenty of material to think about. If you never wore a uniform, a few things might not be readily understandable but you will still have an interesting story to read (maybe skipping a few pages here and there) - highly recommended."
5,About Face/the Odyssey of an American Warrior,"Buy it, read it, love it. I've owned this book for many years and still find myself picking it up from time to time and re-reading it. It's just that good!"
3,I feel his pain and would like to give him some more as well,"Memoirs of Dave Hackworth, otherwise known as ""Hack."" He was a real jerk that went off on the Army. He went off on them for good reasons, based on experiences in Korea and Vietnam, but I found him to be just as guilty as the things he was criticizing. Ended up quitting the army and being chased by the Army in an attempt to smear him. How they failed at this is one of the greatest arguments proving the Army's lack of ability to carry through on an objective. I could not recomend this book based on the author's persistent foul language and basic crude nature. I learned a lot about Korea and Vietnam wars but was hindered from enjoying the book fully because of the author."
5,This book is best military leader guide on the market.,"Cononel Hackworth is a legendary warrior whose feats of valor are spellbinding, but most importantly this book is a gift from God to any commander. As a former Army Reserve Brigade commader I used this book as the Bible for Senior NCO and officer monthly training. If you command or lead-read it one time for pleasure then read it again and underline the training ideas. Share it with your warriors. This book may be the most significant military book of the last part of the 20th Century. In the future it may be as important as Rommel's infantry tactics book was to the first half of the century."
5,Patton wouldn't have made it in today's army,"Hackworth's hard earned lessons in leadership should be read by all students of the warrior profession. Sadly, the book rings true--many of the higher officers in the US Army are not warriors, but merely politicians with a uniform. In order to make it, one has to keep quiet and not make waves. This is the reason we lost Vietnam: our military leadership lacked the moral courage to do what they knew was right. Hackworth is a great warrior and his calls for military reform is what got him and other great leaders drummed out of the army."
5,"If you read only one book this year make it, About Face.",I read About Face several years ago now. It is a long read and you will find yourself emursed in the life of this man we come to know as Hack. I emailed this man several times and he always responded back. He has sinced died and America has lost a son. This book is the best read ever if you have a patriotic bone in you don't miss it.RJS
3,burnt?,I imagine this would have been a perfect mat if it wasn't melted. It appeared to be melted in the middle of the mat. It looked like someone hung it face down over a very hot pipe or something. Luckily I'm using this in my garage and I don't care about the cosmetic appearance.
3,OK but not great,"This is a cheaper model, I knew that going in but figured Id try anyway. The rubber is very hard and provides less cushion than the higher end models. For the price its ok"
1,No excuse for this CD,"This CD is a blatant attempt to capitlize on archived music, with absolutely no regard for quality. The sound is horrible, and the CD includes the shorter 45 rpm mix of ""Crimson & Clover"" rather than the album mix. Imagine putting a portable AM radio in your CD player and you'll have an idea how bad this CD sounds. And there is absolutely no excuse for any ""Best of..."" CD shipping with an emasculated version of a group's best song. Pass on this one and spend your money on something worthwhile."
1,Tommy James C.D.,This C.D. is very poor quality sound. It is obviously recorded from an album or other type of recording that is not good. It sounds hollow and tinny. I was very dissappointed.The delivery of the C.D. was good; I received it in the allotted time in good physical condition.
1,tame and boring,"I'm not sure what planet the other reviewers live on, but I remember Tommy Jmes from the 60s and his music was and is the worst kind of schlock. It will be interesting to see if Amazon lists this review or if they want only good reviews so that people will buy."
4,Crystal Blue Perfection,"Think about the fact that AM radio was the primary domain of Tommy James & The Shondells back in the '60s. Then think about how much lamer AM radio is nowadays (and FM for that matter). This is the best stuff from a really good group, back when radio was worth listening to and ever-more-amazing stuff was coming out practically weekly.My only complaint, to repeat what other reviewers have said, is that the chopped version of Crimson and Clover is on this album. Fortunately, I still have a vinyl album that has the long version on it. But why, oh why didn't they include it on this CD? (Especially when CDs can hold 74 minutes of music.) Rhino, I usually love your compilations, but this is a rip-off!"
2,aside from Human Nature Sounds like Chris Tucker singing,"aside from ""Human Nature"" this Compilation sounds like Chris Tucker singing from Rush Hour 2&this isn't as funny as that was in the film.the Singer here is really straining&it's good for a laugh.these type of Albums usually [stink]&this is the same pattern.MJ as with any other Important Artist deserves far better than this."
2,very very BAD,I bought this and didnt like it at all as with tribute albums most of them are very bad and this lives up to it the same guy released an album a few years back called Salute ot MJ so when I bought this one I thought it was a different guy how wrong was I oh well Ill learn the next time......................
2,Disgracement to All Fans of The King Of Pop,"I recently purchased this compiliation album at Sam Goody, feeling that the cover of the Michael Jackson songs would be phenomenal. After listening to about 5 of the tracks in complete, I was dissatisfied. In 'Dangerous', Michael speaks in a slow and sleak voice. Yet the singer covering the song rushes through the spoken part, leaving ten second gaps between the the next phrase. Every song on this album, with the exception of 'Human Nature', puts shame to the King of Pop. Most of these songs sound like the Vocal Guides to a MJ karaoke cassette."
2,repetitive,"Instead of ""every kind of writing,"" the subtitle should say ""fiction and personal narrative."" Some of the big names have interesting things to say, but this book is mostly little-known short story writers telling you that Mark Twain is great, people in their families were great story tellers, well-developed characters in stories are important, read a lot, humor writing doesn't get the respect it deserves, and then again, Mark Twain is great. And, that you can't have great humor writing without great writing, but there's plenty of mediocre writing in this book, like too many cutesy parenthetical asides.There are some interesting points here and there, but the price of a used copy will be more in line with the book's value."
5,A classic that you'll diplay on your shelf with pride,"This series has the best qualities that you wish every story had. The plot is intersting and well formed, the characters are lovable and have alot of depth, the artwork is beautiful (especially the character designs, Rei is hot!), and so much more. I usually stay clear of most romance and shoujo(girls) manga, but I've become addicted to this series. I even got my sister (who NEVER reads anything) to read these books and she's in love with them too.Mars is a classic series and it's easy to see why tokyopop picked this title to help launch their manga collection which has become such a huge success. (check out the publisher's other titles if you get the chance)"
5,Homework is Fun,"Fun Family Centered ActivitiesFor 3 years I have used this book as homework. Every student gets a notebook at the beginning of the year. We talk about using the front and back of each sheet and even completing more than 1 assignment on a sheet. Every month they are given a new calendar. They must complete 3 out 5 activities a week and turn it in by Friday.Within a couple of months most of my class completes the homework by themselves and just ask their parents to look it over. On some of the more involved projects, the parents help out.My objective with homework in the second grade is to teach responsibility. The assignments are fun and easy which makes it easy for children to become responsible for completing the work and turning it in. This is important because I do not always have children with parents able to help them. With this book I have never had any child or parent say ""It's too hard,"" or, ""We didn't understand.""I love this book. I wish they made it for 4th grade..."
1,Not good at pulse monitoring,Very difficult to get a pulse reading. Impossible if moving and never back to back consistent readings. I consider it a waste of money.
2,Not my style of singing,"Wow, I would really dig this album if she didn't sing. I'm a fan and saw here in concert. She seems to sing largely from her mouth (instead of mixing her breath with diaphragm) and it can get a little annoying. Maybe this is just not my style. Postscript: After writing this review, I did a search and found much more articulate criticism of her singing."
2,I wanted to like this book,"I loved the title and the back cover blurb. The first chapter was great and the next few chapters good. Then the author seemed to get bored with her own story and not know what to do next. It slid downhill fast and turned into such a snooze I just kept skimming from chapter to chapter waiting for something interesting happen. Folks....it never did.I kept waiting for Casey and Morgan to fall in love and I never ""saw"" or felt that happen! It was like, at some point, the author told us they were in love but I, as a reader, never experienced it and that is what I read Romances for!I really can't recommend the book."
1,Don't be misled,"I have to wonder if I read the same book that all these other five star reviewers read. This book proved a real disappointment, after I had already purchased this book and its sequel. All I found was a slow-paced and unrealistic plot with uninteresting characters. I couldn't even bring myself to finish the book, because I found that I just didn't care what happened in the end. I try to pick books that will be captivating and realistic, whether it's a fantasy, mystery, action/adventure or romance. But this book did nothing for me, so I would not recommend it."
5,Wonderful First Communion Gift,"This is an attractive, full-color, child-friendly prayer book at a very reasonable price. At under $4 (for the softcover) it would make an excellent choice for parishes and schools to purchase for First Communicants. A substantial collection of traditional and ""home-made"" prayers are presented in a comfortable format. The book also includes prayers and mysteries of the Rosary, prayers from the Mass and a section on ""Stuff Every Catholic Kid Should Know: Learning Our Faith Tradition"". Highly Recommended!"
4,Good mystery,I like reading mysteries that take place in other countries. It helps me learn about other places and the way other people live (I'm in the USA). It's such a bonus when the novel is so good.
2,It doesn't get much pulpier,"Why is this author so popular? I'm sorry but this is badly written trash- the plot isn't even very compelling. Mostly in the pulpy ""bad cop"" genre, roughing up bad guys and hitting on dames every other page. The only interesting thing was it showed that the Dutch are not as cool as I thought they were."
3,Finding Mr. Right,"Finding Mr. RightKit, Susannah, Alison - Single, successful and not searching for husbands - but love finds them anwyay!Everywhere she looked, there were babies...and Alison longed for one of her own. She wasn't yearning for wedding bells though: Alison was happily single - she simply wanted to be a mother!Then along came Dr. Logan Kavanaugh. He knew everything about making babies, and he needed a wife! If Alison agreed to marry him, she could have her baby - and a gorgeous husband she never even knew she wanted...until he proposed!Book three of three in the Finding Mr. Right trilogyThe Billionaire DateThe Playboy AssignmentThe Husband ProjectOverall a cute setup and a nice end to this trilogy."
3,"worthwhile rarities, but musically dull","I couldn't pass up this album because it has some songs that are hard to find elsewhere, especially this version of ""Overture From Tommy,"" but it's a confused collection. Unlike the first albums of this series that were highly focused on a given year, this one spans from late 1969 (when ""Midnight Cowboy"" first appeared on the charts) through late 1972 (""The City of New Orleans""). Also, some of the songs are too obscure (""Small Beginnings"") and there are no really exciting songs anywhere, which makes it a fairly dull listening experience."
3,Musical schizophrenia,"Volume 16 of the ""Have a Nice Day"" series looks like someone threw three or four musical jigsaw puzzles into the air and then mixed the pieces. There is absolutely no sense of direction or continuity to this wildly disparate collection.""Vehicle"" and ""Ride, Captain, Ride"" are potent mainstream rockers. Ferrante & Teicher's ""Midnight Cowboy"" is easy listening approaching big band. ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing"" and ""City of New Orleans"" have strong folk overtones, and Wayne Newton's ""Daddy, Don't You Walk So Fast"" has obvious country leanings.To make the mix even more muddled, two cuts (Overture from Tommy and The Lion Sleeps Tonight) are well known tunes that unfortunately are better known when performed by other artists.All that notwithstanding, this is still a pretty good disc. If nothing else, it's anything but boring."
1,garbage,"800 number gives you a recording advising that Cosmi no longer is accepting calls. Doesn't work on Windows 7, but doesn't bother mentioning this in ad. Don't order. They're just selling off their leftover stock I would assume. Amazon should quickly distance themselves from this company. I have nothing but good things to say about Amazon so please don't blame this on them."
5,Great photo paper!!,"Great delivery, arrived 2 days later! Smooth transaction.Loved the samples and extra sheets! Had graet results in pictures I printed. Would recomend to anyone looking for quality and a great deal!"
5,One of the most relevant books available on systems theory,"Utilizing Murray Bowen's multi-generational family systems model as a framework, Friedman has crafted a book that offers tremendously practical insights in the area of organizational leadership, as well as personal development. The book significantly enhances one's understanding of the connection between one's role in their family of origin and role in organizational leadership. He rightly asserts that one's family of origin role interrelates to how one functions in an organization, in addition to how the organization functions as a whole. I highly recommend this book to anyone in a position of leadership; for those who want to gain further insight into their family of origin issues, or want to learn about Bowen's multi-generational approach to family systems theory."
3,Do you still want to have a family?,"Dry as saw-dust and complicated to follow at times. BUT: once you get your head around what it is he is saying - your disfunctional family starts making sense and you understand why things are the way they are. This can than also be applied to your average disfunctional shul board, work space etc.As much of the problems we encounter are ""inherited"" from previous generations - it might cause the question whether you actually dare to have a family of your own, looking at your nutcase relatives and weirdo siblings..."
2,Generation to Generation,This book was used in a class I took. I found very little value in it. It was returned for someone else's use.
4,Thanks for a great book!,"A professor suggested this book, and I am truly loving it! Great information! Thanks for a great book and for getting to me so fast!"
1,Yawn,'Yawn'...thats all i did through out this book. I love Black Lace books...i own loads and havent had any problems with them...and then i purchased this one. The sex scenes were dull...the story line...well...was there one?...all i read about was a self involved...spoilt...drug taking...daddys girl...and i can read about those in a magazine if i want to
1,"I know a good read when I see it, and this isn't it...","I know a good read when I see it, and this isn't it. I love a lot of the black lace novels. In fact I haven't had a complaint about one of them, until this one. I felt like the writer instead of trying to get into the story was trying to act like teens in society today. I mean the way the Princess acted is hardly what every teen today does. And I know your thinking yeah right, a lot of teens do drugs, have sex, and get into a whole bunch of trouble. But this character instead of relating to her I got bored and annoyed by how she acted and how dumb she was before I got to the middle of the book. I give this book one star, because I didn't find it a good read and it just kind of bored me to tears."
3,What do you mean reluctant .....,"Maybe her name was princess but thats about the only thing that I would find princess like with this young heroine.Martha is pretty well a skinny, wasted druggie that seems to have maintained her ability to think. She has ties to a wealthy family, and her sister who seems to have all the family money is married to some bigamist kook up in Utah or one of those states where womes seem to really enjoy sharing their men...She likes her sex rough especially on drugs. qWhen her boyfriend private eye is taken out of the picture she hooks up with his parter who similarily before the middle of the book gets the living daylight beat out of him too and spend the rest of the book in the hospitalIf erotica were food I would classify this book as a plain balogna sandwich with no butter or mustard or cheese .... LOL"
4,Great late night flick!,"It may not be a five star winner to be featured as an all-time great classic in your home video library, but what makes this film so great is Kathy Shower. Kathy has to be the most beautiful woman to ever hit the cover of Playboy Magazine. I can only hope that she continues to star in similar films to prove her capability not only as a sexy cover starlet, but as a supporting actress for erotic late night thrillers. I suggest you buy the unrated version where Kathy gets out of the shower at the beginning NAKED! In the R-rated version she gets out of the shower after reaching for a towel to cover herself. Want to see more? Then buy this movie...I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"
4,A good book where the author knows how to teach,"The author seems to be aware what beginning students in the world of programming get bogged down by and how to take care of it.For ex. the author explains in the appendix the concept of using namespaces and how this can be accounted for in the more recent form of header file inclusion. To give an instance, he clearly says that if we use the recent form which does not include the .h extension for instance in case of the header file - stdio , then it has to be accompanied by the statement: 'using namespace std' (in this case) or we have precede all identifiers defined inside the library with the keyword 'std' followed by :: or else the compiler would give an error.This is because all recent header files are members of a namespace 'std'. This was just an example that shows that the author has made VC++ accessible to people from a non programming background and I appreciate the effort that he has taken."
5,Shang Gri La,Fantastic movie. This movie will lighten your day and your heart. You may find something in this movie that part of you has always wanted but you didn't know you wanted it till you see this movie.I am not a huge fan of musicals but I loved this. It gives you a lift in life right when you need it. Grab a copy today it will warm your heart.Trish.
3,Not that good!,"I have this computer for 18 months now. Sometimes it sounds like an airplane taking off! Very noisy. Also, it has problems with any monitors and keyboards that i use with it! It can be very annoying....."
5,Gateway GT5034 makes me smile,"I love my new Gateway GT 5034. The BTX style quiet case does it's job keeping the computer purring politely in the background. This is not my first Gateway, and will not be my last. I do prefer the BTX cases to the cases I see on the newer Gateway's. They are not quiet, nor as they as sleek in appearance as the GT 5034 case.As for the HD, RAM etc, plenty to spare. A great product."
1,kind of boring story,i loved all the books by mrs.spencer so far.sorry to say that spring fancy was a disappointment to me.the story is kind of boring.the characters too.from page 1 the outcoming was very predictable.all of mrs.spencer`s books i read were real page turners. this one sometimes layed on my bedside table for days and i just couldn`t bring myself up to continue!
4,"Predictable, but HOT",There is one thing about this book that I can't get out of my mind...a man has ONLY ONE NIGHT with his dream woman -- so he's got to make it count. (WOW!)
3,Spring Fancy,Spring Fancy: Spring Fancy is not among LaVyrle Spencer's best work. The characters seem to be rather shallow and overly emotional.
2,"Tacky, Tacky, Tacky.....","Oh how it breaks my heart to give such a low rating to a book by Spencer, but I just couldnt see it any other way. What an AWFUL story. I couldnt stand the characters. First we have Winn. She was so inconsistent and two faced I wanted to slap her. She would encourage the ""hero"" constantly, only to turn around in a huff 2 seconds later because she just couldnt do that to her fiance...oh, and the ""hero"", Jo Jo..yes, thats right, Jo Jo..oh my. His name is Only the beginning of his problems. He is decribed as having FEMININE curly hair and he is so annoying and childish I just couldnt take it anymore. Slap these two together and wrap them up in a stupid storyline with the most ridiculous dialogue and you have ""Spring Fancy"". So, why 2 stars?...Its a Lavyrle Spencer. Only my love for this author kept me from rating it a 1."
1,Wrong Item,"When I saw the ad on Amazon it was for Drakkar Noir Splash. The item I got was Drakkar Noir Spray. I do not like the spray, but I kept it anyway because it was less trouble than sending it back."
2,Not really a biography,"This article has very little information about Shaw's life. It deals mainly with reviews of his writing, particularly the book and play ""The Man in the Glass Booth."" I would avoid it if you are looking for a general biography -- the internet movie database has about as much as this does."
4,My box has been rocked,"I saw this group on a street corner in San Luis Obispo, CA and I have never felt the same again. I live for this fantastic California sound and I always remember my trip when I hear this CD. I bought copies for all my friends in Boise. Try it, you'll like it."
4,Hard to find songs!,I bought this album to replace some songs for my music collection. 8 out of 12 songs are good. Some of these are hard to find as digital mp3's. Good album. I would mostly recommend it.
1,A Zero Not a 1,This is by far the worst volume in this entire series.There's nothing here even of remote intrest or talent. This CD rates a zero(A CD full of one hit losers!)I believe it's OOP. Thank god.
1,Time Waster,"This program is a waste of time. Limited in the functionality that todays computer users are accustomed to and hangs up constantly. This may have been a ""Perfect"" contact managar 10 or 15 years ago but should be retired by now....."
5,It could have been confusing . . .,". . . but it wasn't. Bonnycastle presents a plethora of modern forms of literary criticism (e.g., structuralism, deconstruction, new historicism, etc.) in a clear and enlightening manner. His use of examples are, in my opinion, superb. As an undergraduate English lit major, I appreciate his well-written guide to what could have been a depressing and frustrating study of literary theory."
2,More art than matter.,"The book could have been compressed to about 1/3 of its size with no loss of content and probably become 10 times more readable. I found myself reading some pages 2 and 3 times trying to figure out what Lassiter was trying to say only to realize he was just reiterating something he had already said in a previous chapter.Wading through text such as:""The primary explanation for the rise of massive resistance can be found in the failure of electorial reapporionment to keep pace with the metropolitan growth and middle-class expansion in the region's political economy.""and:""a consumerist ethos of individual meritocracy grounded in a spatial landscape of meropolitan residental segregation and postware suburban prosperity.""made for very tedius reading.His love of acronyms and terms, not defined in the book, leaves me to believe that this book was written only for professional historians and/or sociologists who are already vastly familar with the terminology and settings of his topic."
2,Dry,"Not for the general reader. A piece of dry stone. After reading another book in this series, 'White Flight' by Kevin M. Kruse, I thought thhis would be another exciting and fact-finding experience. Nothing like it. While 'White flight' was packed with real life characters, day by day happenings, almost house by house storytelling, full people doing things and reacting to other people's doings, this one book, 'The Silent Majority' is all first person narration, full of jargon. Scholar's talk.Definitely not for the general reader -and I pity the non-general reader.Avoid all contact."
3,Idols on ice,"This is like the Idols series on ice. And it always makes you wonder what happened to the winners. Entertaining, but not mindboggling."
5,"Everybody , Don't change and Here and now","worlds apart is a fantadtic group. Their first album was very good , the second was very very good and the last one was very very very good. i'm french so i have the chance to have all their album and I can say that they're now a real group of pop and they have much talent..It's imbelievable what you feel when you heard the melody and the words of their songs....If you don't have their Cd just buy it! Please ""amazon"" could you sell not just verybody but don't change and here and now too? Because the fans who are not french or who are not from european country can't buy their cds except here......Thanks!"
3,Blu-ray versus standard,"The music and production is fine.I would not purchase the blu-ray disc ,not a big improvement on the original recording"
2,You get what you pay for..,I paid more in shipping than I did for the product. The product is very cheap. I only used it once and it started falling apart. I may get one or two more uses out of it but that is it. Look else where for something that will last even if you have to pay a little more.
4,nail buffer,This nail buffer is totally cool. I was recently in the mall and a guy in this booth in the middle of the mall wanted $60 for this same buffer. This one works just as good and it was $10 after shipping and handling.
2,Sizing is strange,"I ordered this for my 4 yo. I went by the measurements, not the manufacturer's suggested sizing and ordered a toddler size, instead of small child. According to the manufacturer, this size is suppose to fit a 1 or 2 yo. She was only an inch above the width measurement, which seemed much closer than the next size up. Unfortunately, the shoulders and chest were too snug. She's also on the upper end of the height scale, and yet the length fit, so I'm not sure what toddler would fit this; a really tall, skinny one, I guess. The quality was okay; not perfectly straight."
2,Too big,This says for one to two year old but my on the small side 2.5 year old can maybe wear it in 3 years!! It is huge and from what I can find I can't find a smaller size.
2,She loves it but it probably won't last a week.,"First off, the product's tear away sleeves do not look like the photo's. It is three little velcro squares around the arm hole. Next, the size descriptions are way off here. It says the Small fits 2-4 years old. The package for it says Small is 4-6 years old. It is huge on my daughter. Of course once I tried it on her there was no way I could exchange it for a smaller size... she won't take it off without a fight. The string that ties around the waist is three strings twisted together. They have already split apart after maybe an hour of wear (she wasn't doing gymnastics in it.. she was laying down and watching a movie). The glitter is getting EVERYWHERE. The ""tiara"" is flimsy plastic that broke when I was trying to assemble it. So, overall, I would say... we don't recommend this product. We are going to try and return it since it is falling apart."
3,Fiona custome....overall good value,"Overall the custome is good for the price. The sleeves are a little hard to attach to the custome because it uses velcro, so they needed to be reattached often and sometimes won't hold in place. The tiara is extremely cheap in quality... you will need to buy one. Unfortunately, we found a better one in Target after Halloween for just $1.00."
4,Pictures I Had to Take,I loved looking at the pictures in this book. It has helped me to look at things in a different light. There are so many little details that are picture worthy that we miss because we are not breaking down what we are seeing. I plan on using this book to inspire my picture taking skills and to actually take out the camera and start shooting.
3,Joel Grey photo book,"Although the subject and title of this book that was read about in a magazine article , sounded cool, broadway actor of old etc., the actual product was a bit of a let down. The seller delivered fast and the book showed up in perfect condition in plastic, ideal. It's just that the big coffee table book was not possessing of any real interesting pictures. They may have been significant to the actor, whom I like, but I thought they would be more profound or theatrical that they were. Some were of just dilapitated buildings, which can be very nice...these were just sort of there...not interesting at all. Over all..ok,but not the splashy content I'd hoped it would be. Thanks ! LL"
2,Did Not Deliver,"I was expecting more about the content on the DSM-IV and a step-by-step process of asking the patient questions based on how the interview is going. What kind of language or behaviors should a psychiatrist look for? If anyone could recommend a book like this, please let me know."
2,Wordy and confusing..,"I was really disapointed with this overly detailed Mid. East Outline. Read, 'Christian Family Guide Explains The Middle East Conflict' it's MUCH better."
1,Garbage,My wife got this book from the library for a small amount. I opened it and the first thing I read compared the Arab tactics to Nazis. It's now found a permanent home in the garbage can.
2,Cable is terrible on some tvs,"Didn't like the cable at all. Made my picture quality look washed out, almost like a film covered the screen. Made me feel like I wasted money in order to make my hdtv look like garbage."
5,THESE WORK GREAT! Make sure you dont over pay!,"the only reason I got these ""monster"" cables is because they were like $3 more than the standard version. I wouldnt recommend spending A LOT of money on these cables but if you can find them cheap, go for it. they are essentially the same as the standard wires but they look pretty and feel sturdy. i would only recommend it if you can get it cheap like i did. if you cant, the standard cables should do just fine!"
4,Love it but slight problem!!!,"OK, Great product. Love the detail that is shown on my LCD only problem is the audio output wont output to for instance on my TV is a headphone jack input for audio when you set it to VGA. So when I use this cable its all video and no audio. Since I dont have a high speed awesome sound system. So, If you have a sound system separate from your TV that uses digital output. then your in business, if you have independant control over the audio input on your tv and can set you TV to VGA and RCA Audio. Than this cable is perfect. However if your the average kid. or your like me and deployed to Iraq and dont have a sound system to output the audio to. Sorry but this cable is not going to work for you. I highly suggest the HDMI or SCART (If you can find this one) cables."
3,Just one outstanding song.,"I bought this CD only for ""They Can't Take Away Our Music,"" which is a very powerful and beautiful song about black music in America. It got a fair amount of radio play at the end of 1970, which is when I started liking it. Interestingly, I still have never heard a single comment about what African-Americans thought about this song. I'm white and I love the song. The rest of the album was definitely disappointing, although a few songs have a nice Caribbean sound with guiro, like ""Pretty Colors."" The cover songs ""Paint It Black"" and ""Nights in White Satin"" are pointlessly long, too loosely structured, and add no new interest; they seem like trashy afterthoughts meant only as filler. However, Eric Burdon does all these songs with soul and seriousness, so the album's not really bad, just not very commercial."
2,Boring,"This is the worst of the 3 albums Eric made with War. Way too long songs that keep on repeating themselves. The Paint It Black Medley is explosivly energetic, and makes at least disc 1 wort to own. The relatively short track 'Out Of Nowhere' is also found here with a lot of deep lyrics. The rest of the album is just too boring to me. Eric himself hates this album, and so do I (almost). The other two albums, Love Is All Around and Eric Burdon Decleares War, is much better. Especially Love Is All Around."
4,Not just for word freaks,"I don't play competitive scrabble. To be honest, I don't even like scrabble that much. But I just wanted to add the comments of a scrabble outsider. This is a compellingly good read. I stole moments away from my family to finish this book, staying up to 1:30 a.m. to knock off the last chapter, and I really enjoyed it. It's not the definitive work on obsessive genius, nor is it a perfect ethnographic look at a subculture, but following Fatsis' rise (decline?) into competitive scrabble, and his amusing, often biting, portrayals of its devotees kept me turning pages long into the night. This book isn't just for scrabble fans."
4,I'm torn ...,"I could easily give this 5 stars but ... <sigh> I don't know. If you're a hardcore Scrabble fan or even someone who gets very wrapped up and intense while watching the National Spelling Bee (and how can you NOT?) then click the Order Now button and wait on pins and needles for the book to arrive. It's THAT good. If however, you quite like Scrabble but can go weeks or months (or even days) without playing or automatically totalling up words in your head then it might not be for you. It's excellently written but I think anyone not consumed by Scrabble or, at the very least, hardcore linguaphiles, might find parts of it very dry and hard to get through. So it gets four stars. But Scrabble fanatics can assume at least one of the stars is on a triple letter score space ;p"
3,Word Games,"In ""Word Freak,"" author Fatsis describes competitive Scrabble players who live for having the last word. Fatsis, a reporter with the Wall Street Journal, begins his story by focusing on a half dozen real-life characters immersed in the intense Scrabble scene. The wordplay, games and history of the game are fascinating reading as are the colorful, single-minded personalities of the top Scrabble players. Gradually, though, Fatsis becomes an integral part of that group and his perspective changes from reporter to subject, from observer to participant and from writer to word freak.As Fatsis transforms into a word freak, he becomes as self-absorbed and one-dimensional as the people on whom he was supposed to be reporting. The irony is that by trying so hard to have the last word, Fatsis wins Scrabble games but loses his story and his audience. Word freak, indeed."
5,A really great read.,"I haven't played Scrabble in years (& then only as a hobbyist) but you don't have to play Scrabble to like this book. It's a terrific read for anyone who's ever been competitive and an interesting meditation on the roles that both discipline and talent play in becoming really great at something.Fatsis starts off wanting to document people who are obsessive about Scrabble and ends up obsessive himself. An interesting and seemingly honest look at his own journey while at the same time a good portrait of the Scrabble-playing world.Suitable for many people on your gift list, I should think."
4,Word Freak,"I picked this up at the library after watching Word Wars, a documentary about some of the same Scrabble experts. I was happy to find that it held my interest all the way through. I'm a bit of a word geek at heart, and I love observing people; this was a good fit for me. I highly recommend it."
2,disappointing,"I really, really wanted to like this book and actually gave two copies as presents before I'd even read it myself. Sadly though, I'm still slogging through it and it is tough going. Though I'm not even in the realms of the blue-hairs, I do love Scrabble and thought I'd be interested in the in-and-outs but am finding his style of writing tedious and annoying at best. I like when he talks about other players or the history of the game but find myself falling asleep when he talks about his tournament games and attempts to memorize words. I'd recommend this book only for those so obsessed with the game that they'd care enough to know all the four letter possibilities and why SATINE is such a perfect word. For the rest of you (us), use what free-time you have to just enjoy the game."
5,Scrabble Mania!,"I loved this book. Witty, entertaining, smart, and insightful! What is especially wonderful is how the auther becomes so enthralled by this word game. His chracters studies give true insight to the quirkiness of genius. I thought that the best part of his book involved his discussion of female champion Scrabble players and how their approach differed from the men's. I too got the Scrabble itch and am looking at learning how to improve my game!"
3,Narrator's personality gets in the way.,"I've done my best to read Word Freak, having heard great things about this memoir of the Scrabble championships but so far I just can't get past my dislike of the narrator. He interupts the flow of the book to either brag about his education (he has a degree in journalism) and yet he revels in his ignorance of words when the other better Scrabble players most often not only know if a set of tiles makes a word but what that word means. The author seems satisfied with only memorizing the word minus the definition because if the word were important he'd already know it. He does after all have a journalism degree. I passionately hate that line of reasoning."
3,Word Freak So so,"Book is ALL about Scrabble. More than I really care to know, by far. Thought it was kinda long for a book all about board games."
1,A Small Problem,I am actually in the process of returning this product because the first five chapters were put in the book upside down and backwards. It wouldn't be too much of a problem but the pages were cut incorrectly and the first three or so sentences are missing from the top of each page.
1,Stick with Blood Omen.,"This has good graphics, I have to admit, but mostly the whole game is a big strip of land with nothing but rocks and fire that's there for no reason (literally! You go through a big bare strip of land!), there are no swords, maces, or axes, just primitive spears that you grab off walls! Everything you kill is killed the same way: Impaling. In Blood Omen, you can make your victims explode, implode, drain their blood, cast a spell to make them kill each other, etc. And it's lack of direction is annoying. Normally, I love challenges, but this is rediculus! No matter ho hard you try, you can't find the way to where you are supposed to go, and they don't even give you a world map, so you don't know wher ...you are supposed to go anyway! Stick with Blood Omen..."
2,"One huge glitch, you may want to avoid this game!","I played this game years ago, but I never got to where I am right now! I'm at the part where you should float on top of the pipes to get to Zephon's Lair, and one thing is that there is almost no way to get past that part; if you're lucky, you will make it the first time, if not, you will be trying over 500 times, nothing!This game can also be frustrating as in difficulty, you can get lost very easily! I just do not recommend this game, unless you love to deal with bugs! Avoid at all costs!"
1,Why the big change?,"The first Legacy of Kain game was the best game I have played, ever. Soul Reaver seems to take on the characteristics of every other game available. It's a weak version of the lamest games out there. In comparison with the Blood Omen, I'm sorry, I wasted my money. It's a wannabe of just about every role-playing game out there. When I bought it, I was hoping for something better. In fact, I quit playing it because it was so bad."
3,It's good but...,"The storyline, the graphics, the sound are really great but some parts of the game are annoying... if you failed in a jump you must do all (i mean it, ALL) over again.. and I suggest to have a walkthrough at your side because it's really easy to get lost... or known where do you must go when you complete a task... It's good but you must have a lot of patience."
5,excellence in gaming,"Let me lay it down for you right now. This is the best game that I've seen for the playstation console. Yes, I admit it has it's faults, clipping and such, but even the power-house mainstream titles put out by giants have flaws. You will be hard pressed to find a more pleasing environment to explore, and character movement, depth and story line are phenominal. The intro movie had me restarting the game 4 or 5 times every time I played. The ending may be a little dis-heartening, but didn't we all want a sequel anyway?"
5,Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,"I've been playing Soul Reaver ever since I was in Kindergarden & I haven't stopped playing it ever since.This is truely a classic for the playstaion or Dreamcast. I have it on my Dreamcast, but Own a Digital Download of it on my PSP & PS3 aswell. Thats how much I like this game. lol But the graphics are a lot better on Dreamcast. You just gotta deal with the controller of the DC. but other than that, This is a must own. All Legacy of Kain games are for their storylines."
4,Wow! Amazing,"ok, I have to be honest. This game totally rocked. The graphics were surprisingly impressive and the combatives that you use, (Such weaponry as the soul reaver, Kain Reaver, Ariel reaver, Fire Reaver, Etc) is impressive and totally sucks you in. There are two reasons that I gave this game 4 stars instead of five stars: It can be very hard due to the puzzles and lack of direction, and plus it can be boring after a while because the enemies get pretty redundant after the first couple of levels. On the other hand, this game is worth buying. I enjoyed exploring the dark, scary, gut wrenching and yet unique world of Nosgoth, and I am hoping to get Blood Omen 1. Either way, this game is fun. It's impossible not to enjoy this game."
5,An inspired performance!,"Probably the best Holländer on record...opening night of this prodution in Bayreuth, and the electricity can be felt even in decent mono sound 45 years later. Hermann Uhde is the most hauntingly unforgetable Dutchman since Hotter. Ludwig Weber sings with his usual superior musicianship, and Windgassen shines - it's refreshing to hear just how beautifully he could sing apart from The Ring and Tristan. Varnay is a bit cautious, but her final scene at the operas finale when she cuts loose from the back of the stage is absolutely hair-raising...I get goosebumbs just thinking about it! A great cast under the great Knappertbusch who leads with his typical broad but well paced conducting...anyones reaction will be the same as the enthusiastic audience that was present that glorious evening, responding with a thunderous ovation."
4,Couldn't put it down - in a word AWESOME,"I found this book to be informative, entertaining and it put me right in the line of action. Well written and the writer conveyed his feelings well. I didn't feel he was complaining, but I felt he was honest. Every job stinks now and then and Peter Canning seemed proud of his career. I'll buy another of his books without hesitation."
3,"Good True Stories, But Also Tries To Make Political Statemen","Mr. Canning does a good job describing the process he went through to get where he is. However two problems with his work.1. He can go over your head every now and then if you have no medical training.2. He goes off every now and then on government and spends a great deal of time reminiscing about his political career that he had before becoming a paramedic.But, Mr. Canning does give you a feel of feelings go through an EMT/Paramedic during the course of their day as well as what you feel like at the end of the day."
1,What kind of whine do you like? I wanna be respected.,"I've worked ""inner city"" EMS for 4 years, as a medic for one year. The stories are nice, there is a certain amount of sincere thoughts that go along with the job. But the single most overriding theme that came out time and time again is the whining: I wanna be a good medic; I wanna be respected; I wanna be a hero; I keep making mistakes. Most people that have a conscience do want these things, but those with a clue just suck it up and keep working and working to improve. Along with that is the ability to admit mistakes and work on them, not whining and crying about them. The other issue that came out is the sense that he doesn't see patients as people, just as an opportunity to show off how great he can be and improve his image. If you see the book in the library, or the bookstore leaf through it, it may have other elements that appeal to you. I am disappointed in the money I spent."
4,A very enjoyable read,"The book is fun to read and has given me insight into my brother's career as a paramedic. The author tries to give you an idea of what it's like to be a paramedic by relating his anecdotes, stories, and his thoughts over the span of his career. I definitely enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning about what paramedics do. The only thing that irritated me about the book is that it jumps around a lot. There is no real story line and some of the anecdotes seem a little overly dramatic sometimes. Still, the good far outweighs the bad."
2,Not worth it,"This book provides decent information about what it's like to be a Paramedic and EMT; however, the author comes across as cold and self-absorbed throughout most of the book. He is primarily concerned with himself and sees the people he is helping as a means of earning the respect of his co-workers. I know there are plenty of EMTs and Paramedics who joke about patients; however, that is a dark side of the profession and not all people working in EMS are like that. It's sad to know that this book may be the only one a person reads about working in this field, and it may make them re-consider going into this profession if they think all Paramedics have the attitude of this author."
3,Okay....,"This game is okay, Excite bike is more realistic and more enjoyable. The upside to this game is that it is easier to play than excite bike, it does the turns for you (meaning you don't have to push any extra buttons) and it is easier to do the stunts so my 7 year old enjoys it and she also likes customizing her own rider and naming them. If you looking for just one motorcross game to buy go with the excite bike."
1,Skip This game and proceed directly to Excite Bike 64,"I bought this game side-by-side with Excite Bike 64, and it DOES NOT EVEN COMPARE to the quality. The rider physics are pathetic, the gameplay is harsh, rigid, and offers not a single glimpse of the reality of jumping/riding/winning. I love supercross, and this game will let you down for sure. If you want great color, sound, gameplay, realism, controlablity, track-editing... get ExciteBike 64 instead. I haven't touched this game since the first few days I owned it."
3,loose fit,"i bought this accessory maily for use with my canon 180mm macro on my 5D mk2. i'm disappointed with this extension tube because it doesn't fit tightly. it's pretty loose on both ends. if it was cheap and not made by canon I would have understood and maybe accepted substandard quality, but a canon extension tube between a canon lens and a canon camera should fit perfectly. i have over half a dozen canon lenses and extenders and everything fits perfectly, then something as simple as an extension tube comes along and ruins my day. i hope this is an exception and not eveyone is facing the same problem."
1,Don't bother,"I found that this product was a waste of time and effort for anything but extremely close photography. As soon as you go beyond a couple of feet, focusing was impossible. Both manually and auto."
3,Saggy-Baggy Girl (when did this HAPPEN???),"I had a bottle of the 1990's formula of this product and it was outstanding; it would take wrinkles out of linen shirt. Sadly,the new formula isn't as spactacular. But I have a plan: I will leave the cap off and let some of the fluid evaporate; this ought to bring the concentration closer to the original formula. Buy this stuff at your own risk. If you have trenches like I do, it may disappoint; if you are just starting to head South, this product may be just what you're looking for. It beats any cream out there and really does last as long as it claims (up to 8 hours)."
5,Has Stickers!,"The book arrived great, my daughter seems excited about them. Haven't had a full chance to go through all of it, But it does seem great. Many more pages than I expected! This does have stickers too, which always motivates my 3 year old!"
1,Piece of junk!,This phone was a piece of junk that fell apart the first day I had it. Stay away from this thing!
3,Did not deliver as promised,"They hook you in by mentioning the big stars featured. ""The Stars"" appear only towards the end and they perform for a very short time. The rest of the show is awful. The sound-mix sucks. No bass at all - and it's supposed to be Reggae! No, no, no, no... It could have been better. I am very disappointed with this DVD, I want my money back."
5,An incredible view into this masterful trio - well done!,"If you have ever heard Spider John, Dave Ray, and Tony Glover play then you probably have this DVD already - if not you need to hear these folks lay it down like no one else and this video performance/documentary hits it out of the stadium parking lot - this is extremely well done, informative and just down right great STUFF THAT WORKS. Real music performed by real folk - some of the best acoustic rocking rag folk blues you will ever hear - The Real Truth Americana Folk smack you in your soul music played by true craft masters, and an excellent look at the lives and play of these musical greats! R.I.P. Dave Ray, You Mattered Brother!!! As for Amazon and the service they provided on this purchase: it was top notch, good price, and very fast free shipping that arrived days early - Thank you Amazon!"
2,"Excellent, But Not Good Over Time","When I first put this on my bed, it was excellent. A vast improvement. But overtime the fibers within it clumped together, especially at the ends, making it a very lumpy bed. After about 2 years, it was so bad I had to take it off. I have yet to find a way to smooth out the lumps and it is taking up a lot of space in my closet because I can't bring myself to just throw it away!"
1,Wrong order,I asked and thought that I was getting a king size. I received a twin. Therefore the gift was a goof.Thanks
1,You only get ONE coupon code,This cd tells you to go to their website and submit a form to get a coupon code. You only get one. You do not get 2 as it says here. This cd is pretty useless since the practice test are free to download from their website. The description is misleading.
1,The Day Runner of Doom,Hard to understand. Poor instructions. Timely to input information. I sent it back. The concept is great but the reality is poor.
4,Good starting guide to trees and shrubs in Hawaii,"We picked up this book full price at one of the National Parks on Maui. It really helped us look up several plants we encountered on Hawaii, Maui and Kauai. The pictures are rather small, and further research is needed to determine edibility of these plants, but this book provides a good starting point and Latin names. It is arranged by environmental areas, a good system on an island that goes from coastal to tropical forest to alpine areas on a mountainside with altitude.Recommended. Small size makes it easy to carry."
5,Solid Performance,My friends and I have used ~10 of these Teac drives when building systems for people and they are rock solid. It's worth the extra little money to buy a Teac instead of a lousy drive that comes OEM because this drive is cheap and solid! You need a dependable floppy drive... this is it.
4,"Quality product, but a little expensive for a floppy drive.","You can probably get a floppy drive elsewhere or of a different make, but at least with the TEAC here, you're not going to run into any problems. In my experience, I've never had a problem with my TEAC drives (and I can actually say that some of my other drives HAVE died on me).Get it for peace of mind."
3,IT'S NOT GRAY . . .,". . . it's beige. Like an ancient IBM PC-AT drive. If you're thinking you can order this and get something that will match a aluminum Lian Li case, a Shuttle SV24/25, etc., forget about it.In all other respects, it's just your basic floppy disk drive. As someone else noted, it's an OEM drive, not a retail-packaged product. I don't know why it's priced as high as it is."
3,An okay book if you know what to expect,"I have a pet-peeve that is becoming more of an issue with the prevalence of e-books. If a book was previously published I really feel the publisher/author should make that known. I think the John Easy series was originally published in the 1970s. It's great that books are being re-released but I feel it's fair to warn the reader that the books are dated. There's references to past events, items, and trends. If the reader isn't expecting it, it can be quite unsettling.I've only read ""The Same Lie Twice"" and I won't make a point of reading the rest of the series. They're okay but not really my thing. The series is very reminiscent of John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series or the early Robert B. Parker Spenser novels.Disclaimer: I received the Kindle book in exchange for my honest review."
4,good game,I like this game. it's pretty good. if your have a laptop try to get a mouse because useing the toutch pad reallt sucks when playing this game. overall good game
1,OPERATION FLASHPOINT YEAR EDITION,OPERATION FLASHPOINT WORKES VERY WELL ON WINDOWS VISTA. THE GRAPHICS ARE DATED ALMOST TO THE POINT WHERE HUMAN FIGURES ARE GROSSLY DISTORTED.I WISH I HAD NOT BOUGHT THE GAME.
3,Another hard to load.,"Looked like a good game,but it was hard to load. I have the newest and greatist gadgets on my computer and stillhad to mess with a lot of stuff. then when I finally got the game. Too much hype, I have seen better gamesat Half Price Bookstore for $5.00,then this one! Again too much hype,pass................"
2,Junk-no customer service,I would stay away from this company. I live in AZ and would like to support them but...I bought this unit and it stopped playing DVD's after a couple weeks. They are not returning my emails and their phone maze is unacceptable.
1,Piece of junk with great customer support,"I bought this equipment less than a year ago for one of the bedrooms of our new Bed and Breakfast. The machine has been used no more than 10 times and was never able to read most of the DVD of our collection. I called customer support and was able to speak with a real American (Congratulations to Go Video for this). He told me to clean the lenzes with a special disk that could be bought at Radio Shack which I did. But the reader kept skipping tracks randomely even after the cleaning. I called Customer Support again and the told me that they would exchange the machine for $59.99 plus shipping charges. What a highway robbery. I'll just take it to our dump, write off the cost of the machine and will buy a Panasonic."
1,Misleading Technical Information,"I purchased this GO Video unit specifically to play DVD recorded in the DVD+R and DVD+RW formats. The Amazon.com technical information states that this item is capable of playing these formats. However, the owners manual that comes with the machine only lists the DVD-R/RW formats and even then states that some of those may not play.As it turns out, I was unable to confirm even these capabilities as the DVD player would not even play any of several commercial DVDs without locking up with a frozen display that no button on the remote or on the face of the unit could affect. Only turning off the power and restarting would allow some control to be restored.I have returned the unit as unsuitable for my needs."
1,GoVideo problem,"This company is a JOKE! No customer service phone and nobody wants to answer my emails either. If the product has a warranty, what good is it if I can't get anybody to answer my calls? By the time I reach somebody it will be out of warranty! The DVD player worked about 2 weeks (max) and we take the top off and put it back on & it might work sometimes and sometimes not. What a joke--DON'T buy GoVideo--not worth your money."
2,Worked great for two years then disintegrated,"If you have this or any similar housing, make sure no sunscreen gets on it. This happened in a too hastily packed dive bag and I suspect that even brief contact with the chemicals in sunscreen degraded the plastic. Although it was thoroughly cleaned after a few days the housing started to crack in several places, starting around the hinge, so it could no longer be used on dives. This type of housing is a great concept but the materials used are to flimsy to stand up to actually using it very many dives."
2,A little bit of music....,"The disturbing thing about this CD of Irish/UK/US/Canadian patriotic music is that it is only 26 minutes long. John McDermott could have recorded it during the intermission of a hockey game or his lunch break. The liner notes have all of the verses for each anthem, but McDermott only chooses to sing one verse of each. He is in good voice, but the backup group sounds like a bass, trumpet and electric guitar. Surely this type of music deserves the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and not a garage band. The best cuts are America the Beautiful and Auld Lang Syne. This is the shortest full priced CD I've seen since I started collecting in 1985. I cannot recommend this unless you are a John McDermott groupie."
2,Pepper Pad 3 -- too hot to handle,"In the few days that I had the Pepper Pad 3, I enjoyed it. However, as it neared the end of a battery charge, and in the early part of the recharging cycle, the area of the case under the right hand on the back (presumably the area over the battery?) became literally too hot to touch. Obviously, the interior heat must have been considerably higher.This greatly distressed me, because it was uncomfortable, because I began to fear that the battery might explode (in light of recent stories in the tech news), and because that much heat can't possibly bode well for the longevity of a solid-state electronic device. I returned it.If not for the heat problem, the only complaint I would have had was somewhat short battery life. I would have given it 4 stars."
3,OK Book,"This book was a bit boring. It seemed to skip around a little too much. Bennett is smart, but he is a bit arrogant, which shows through in this book. He could have made the book better by organizing it better.Some interesting information, but maybe not worth the read."
1,Don't do a disservice to your kids.,"This book should never have been put together. Many of the works are butchered. Sometimes not even the original title is included and it seems that authors are missing from several as well. He even butchers Aesops fables -- guess he doesn't want to overtax young minds with the full versions in all their splendor. Of course, many of the selections are classics, but what he's edited out leaves me not only cold but disgusted. If your kids internallize some of the slop used to demonstate these virtues, it will be hard to erase a number of pernitious misconceptions later."
2,Decidedly Dull,"How many of you found sermons vastly entertaining as children? Do you think they'd be more entertaining if in the confines of a book? Victorianate horror(such as the previously mentioned ill fated door slammer poem), prattling on about the often obscure, abstracted moral of the story, do not an interesting book make.Often, the book makes a joke of itself, droning on about *serious* morals drawn from *silly* stories. I gave this book two stars because Bennette obviously put some amount of effort into this book, and I believe that deserves some merrit, sadly, there is not much else in this book that I can congradulate him on."
4,We need more virtues in the world today!,"This book makes a wonderful gift as it entails all the simplistic virtues that life holds using stories, poems and quotes. It is a receipe book for various kinds of ""virtuous soup"" that can be enjoyed weekly, monthly or just in cold weather to learn basic teachings on how to be happy and live harmonious in this world."
5,Morales found outside the Bible,I like these short stories and poems that are gathered up to teach good morales and ethics. Some stories are very old and we get a laugh from and some are very serious to teach children to listen to parents and such. We read a short story or page or 2 each night before bed. My children will even remind me of this time. hope this helps.
5,Book Shelf Basic,"This is a book that would be helpful for not only parents but teachers, Sunday School teachers, and Pastors who have a children's time to have available for reference. A collection of many favorites and classics as well as new stories that help to illustrate basic values which are often lacking in much modern writing."
3,Isn't Humility a Virtue?,The approach is good: Using children's stories to convey moral lessons. This phenomenon exists in many cultures. I believe the best way to understand someone's cultural background is to learn their childhood stories.But where is the chapter on Humility? Is humility not a Western virtue? And perhaps a little more humility would save both the premise and the book from the unpalatable arrogance that makes this otherwise nutritious read difficult to swallow.
4,Teaching Tool,I think this is a great tool to teach anyone unaware of the value of exercising virtue in their lives. I recommend this book for anyone trying to explain or learn what is needed to live a fullfilling life.
2,Good idea didn't come out too well,"Celebrating virtue is a good thing. Compiling stories in praise of them is also good. Bennett's approach though leaves alot to be desired, labeling many things virtues on which others might disagree (cleanliness is on par with honesty??). A better job of editing and selecting stories would have made this well-meaning project much more enjoyable.I am a bit confused by other reviewers' comments that Bennett pushes a conservative ideology here. His right-wing views are well-known but don't come across in the book. I am a liberal but found nothing ""conservative"" about his selections. Bennett specifically states at the start that good, moral people can be liberal or conservative, which I thought was very virtuous of him."
1,Oh boy,I'm sure children will love having these stories read aloud to them- stories about naughty little boys who didn't eat their vegetables and DIED. The stories are all boring and pointless.
4,"Overall, I recommend it.","This book was assigned to one of my MBA classes. The book itself was a good source of reference not only for my business law class but also to other two classes. The book's language is simple and easy to understand. The only flaw I found about this this book was that some cases were complex and I had to refer to actual law books and regulations. Overall, I recommend this book."
4,Quite Comprehensive,"This text offers great details, but I did not rate it as 5 stars because (1) when searching for content, it is difficult to see the key words in the text and (2) the case studies are well selected, but since they are inserted throughout the chapter, it is challenging to determine where the case ends and the author's content begins.Overall, I would recommend the Jennings text and will keep a copy on my shelf."
4,Useful text; accomplishes stated purpose,This book is a textbook useful for a stand-alone course in Law & Ethics. The strength of the book to me was the comprehensive listing of court cases and internet sites.
2,overstate the status of the book,"the book does not match with sellor's description. I feel a little upset.the sellor said the book is very good. In my opinion, it is acceptable, even poor condition. the hard cover is damaged severely and very dirty with a lot of highlights.the worst quality I have purchased."
1,15 days to tell us they didn't have the book.,I ordered the book from them on Nov1. On Nov 15 I called and they told me they didn't have it. The money was returned by Amazon.
4,Perfect introduction to quality music,Great way to introduce your child to music w/out going the classical or 'Barney' route.
3,Rockabye Baby,"I'm not a nirvana fan, I got it for my partner, but what i've heard sounds good.Metallica is the best out of all 3 I have."
3,Ok,Not as cool as I hoped but still neat. We listen to it but if I could go back probably would have skipped it.
5,love,"i love all pf the rockabye baby cds, i got 4 different ones and they all sounded great. my niece and nephew love them and so do i. their parents were thrilled too to have cds to put the babies to sleep"
5,Great baby shower gift!,This is the best gift for a baby shower if you're on a budget and the person you give it to digs rock music. Nirvana sounds spectacular even when performed as a lullaby! Also the CD is just very cool.
2,Okay I suppose,Not as good as others such as Pink Floyd or Bob Marley.... Hard to really make out any of the songs as Nirvana... Basically sounds like random lullabye music...
5,Great Message Delivery,I love how the stories are told. It comes to life with the way he tell them. This is a great way to bring people together and ease their mind from this treacherous time.
4,Music from the realm of Mendelssohn and Brahms,"I share my enthusiasm for the music of Eduard Franck and his son, Richard, with that of the other reviewers of this disc. But I have a slight difference of opinion about the music herein. I find the violin concerto to be below the best of Eduard Franck with its foresquare and almost banal thematic material; further, there is some uncertainty in the playing of the otherwise excellent Christian Edinger, a violinist whom I generally admire.But the symphony is a real jewel, particularly in its mournful adagio and the allegro third movement, the latter with its playfulness via the use of Brahmsian hemiolas. This symphony is a real find, and the playing of the Saarbrucken Radio Symphony under Hans-Peter Frank is exemplary.Scott Morrison"
1,Terrible Reference for Social Workers,I've been a Master's level social worker for 15 years and have seen how our society has changed in dealing with racial and ethnic minorities. Dr. Sue apparently would like to ignore the changes and continue to rehash the old steretypical behaviors of white Americans at their worst. All of his examples of prejudicial thinking and discriminatory actions are about whites mistreating minorities. He paints a picture of social work being run by uptight white middle class do-gooders who hold their clients to their own ethnocentric standards. Dr. Sue comes across as having personal issues with white people. The research he quotes is old and selective. The view he givesis really detrimental to our field.
2,Two of my daughters favorite songs are NOT on this!,"We saw the Raggs band at Sesame Place last summer. I did not know the names of the two songs she LOVED after watching them perform, and so I gambled and chose this one, and they were not on here. She wasn't too thrilled with the rest of the CD."
1,Worst buy ever,"A waste of eight bucks. Looks ok, and you would think that a phone would be so ubiquitous that it would be hard to get wrong, but man, this thing is wrong. The sound is terrible, tons of background static. I get better sound on my 4-year-old cell phone. Plus, the included phone cord is way to short, pretty much meaning you can't stand up with it if it is on your desk, you must remain seated in order to keep the phone from being jerked up into the air with you. You'd be better off going to Goodwill and getting a secondhand phone from back in the day when they knew how to build one."
2,Not in GOOD shape,"When buying this 45 I read the standings on whether it was in fair, good or excellent shape. I went with the one that said good and looked at the picture of the 45. It looked great! When i opened the box I was VERY dissapointed to see that someone had drilled a hole right through label, right through the title of the song! Well since I was going to use this as a part of a wall decoration...it was no good to me. The buyer should have wrote in the description that the label was damaged and would have looked for another one."
2,What a disappointment...,"The movie itself is horrible. Being one listed under blood and gore, it hardly consisted of any good graphics. It's like a bad B-movie. Victoria Pratt's character, being the heroine, is also one of those annoying, ""perfect"", main characters. She kicks ass and shows little to no flaw, which makes the plot itself rather boring. Not to mention that the plot was rather scattered.Overall, the film was a waste of time for me. And the fangs? Come on. Trick-or-treaters had better ones that those in the movie!"
4,Great suspense!,"You just never know where Sheldon is going next! This is what they call ""a page turner."" A reviewer sets the scene: "" ""Memories of Midnight"" begins as amnesiac Catherine starts remembering things...like the fact that her husband was killed for her supposed ""murder."" This could prove dangerous to our villain Constantine Demiris, who sends her to London to work for him. Meanwhile, back in Greece, all the people who know that Catherine is still alive are systematically killed, and, just as Catherine find happiness, someone is sent to kill her.""There are a lot of twists and turns and Sheldon does a good job, as he does in ""Windmills of the Gods"" in letting you see how innocent people can get caught up in messes created by very corrupt individuals. This is a good and easy read. :)"
5,Memories of Midnight,"Just one of many great books by the author, Sidney Sheldon. A super page turner, fast easy read, great suspense and twists and turns. I highly reccomend this book."
3,A GOOD TRY by M. Boucher,"MEMORIES OF MIDNIGHT is Sheldon's weakest work. It is not as engrossing as his previous novels. The characters don't come alive as they usually do. Maybe the reason is that THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT didn't need a sequel. How can you surpass a classic? Nonetheless, it is still a fast-paced thriller and, though it may not be a masterpiece, it is still a good read."
3,suspense,"the novel of sidney I consider it as a best classic novel i ever read, it reflects on sociological issues and does involve psychological issues.it terrifies the reader and one's you've read yoyu want it to finish right away."
5,Sheldon does it again,You will devour this book. Sheldon creates exciting scenes and keeps your attention. There is no way you will put this book down. Sidney is one of the greatest writers of all time. I love Sidney Sheldon.
3,Dont expect a good ending,"Catherine is back and still crying like a baby and dying to fall in love! UGH! Hate that part of the story..Besides that... This one was entertaining but not as good as the other one.Demiris is back and ready to hunt down and kill everyone that pisses him off.. This time trying to cover his tracks.Melina.. she kept me reading it. She was so determined and I like determination. I wanted to find out what she was going to do about her husband, after everything he put her through! and what she did was awesome sad, but awesome and she got a standing ovation from me.I didn't like the ending at all! Thats the reason for only 3 stars.. It was so boring, non eventful, after all of the ups and downs that were placed in the books for the ending to be so blahhhh it made me mad!It was like riding a rollercoaster getting to the top where you will be dropped and then the whole park is shut down!So don't expect a superb ending."
3,"Decent read, a bit light","Sheldon's earlier book, ""The Other Side of Midnight"", was a sizzling page turner, compulsively readable, good plot, and some edge-of-your-seat moments.I assumed the sequel,Memories of Midnight, would be as good...but not quite. Actually, with the luxury of hindsight, I think the first book had such a stunning conclusion that I should have guessed it would be hard to take the story any further.""Memories of Midnight"" is a pretty quick beach read and a decent story, just not as well thought out or put together. If you read the first book and then read this one, you'll notice a few parts of the story which are contradictory, making you think Sheldon couldn't remember his own story well enough to carry it into a convincing sequel.Overall I'd rate it as OK."
3,"What ""workshop?""","This is an average book similar to so many photography books that give you an introduction to/overview of landscape/outdoor/nature/whatever photography. Nothing in this book sets it apart from the crowd. The ""workshop"" part is almost non-existent -- just a few brief, vague ""self assignments"" at the end of each chapter."
1,could be a lot better,"ordered this book from local library and glad i did not pay for it. although mr. fortney chose all the right chapter headings, their honestly is not a lot of technical information in this book. a beginner would get no information of value in really learning photography; an intermediate photographer might get some help from the ""exercises'; if you are beyond these levels do not buy this book! you already know much more than is offered. although there are a few good photos, many of them have already been done (much better i might add), by other renowned photographers. i'm sorry but the digital examples are-well-bad. if you really want to learn nature or landscape photography don't bother with this-get ANY of john shaws books-they WILL make you a better photographer. also for sheer inspiration check out art wolfe. too many of the photos in this book are plagiarized from others works-see for yourself...check out the original work of the people he mentions on p184..."
3,I just wasn't too impressed . . .,"This book is a compilation of short works written by many different writers over the last 150 years or so. Therefore, the quality of writing varied greatly from chapter to chapter.Each chapter is devoted to a separate unsolved crime (mostly murders), going all the way back to Jack the Ripper. Some of the chapters were merely a couple of pages, and were unable to do much except describe the bare facts of the case.I had to give this book 3 stars, because some of the chapters WERE interesting. But some of them were drudgery to get through."
2,Pretentious,"The title of this book is so pretentious: ""The Biggest and Best Collection of Unsolved Murder and Mystery Cases"". Really !? Really !? No Really !? So this book showcase 35 cases; well I guess the author of this book is not aware that ""The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes"" showcase hundreds of cases and that ""The Mammoth Book of Bizarre Crimes"" feature more than 300 cases. The book is well written and showcase some interesting cases but if like me you are a True Crime buff then you won't learn anything new.Very pretentious title for a very disappointing book."
2,Bargain bin blech,"Thin and perfunctory renderings of common information: an absolutely dull stew with no visceral effect whatsoever. The historical content is vague & undocumented, and only marginally above that of pulp magazines. There are so many better books than this: don't bother!"
3,not for me,i would not purchase this product again. when my hair is wet it left it very tangled but when my hair would dry it was very soft and silky. i had tried silky's garden emu oil shampoo before this and it never tangled my hair so i will be going back to silky's garden.
3,How cute!,"Anyone, and I mean anyone with young kids who seem to havr too much energy and can't sit still, this c.d. is for you. I gave this one to my kids, who now play it for thier kids, and we are ALL a happy family now. They use singers from other popular bands to remake some of the best Ramones tunes ever, and do a damn good job of it as well. You even get to sing along with the kids as they are in every song and in every chorus on the album. We now have three, count em', 3 generations singining along to the Ramones now. And we are all sure you will do the same with your kids and grandkids when you put this c.d. in the player. Very fun, energetic and interesting to say the least. But, sing it, enjoy it, and be a happy family too! Gabba, Gabba, HEY!"
1,not happy,the rumor of war was not complete it was missing some parts and i did not know it had subtitles that i could not understand not happy with product
2,great program but heavily edited,"The VHS copy that I purchased here on amazon lasted one hour and 45 minutes. According to imdb the original TV broadcast was 195 minutes. So, there was almost an hour edited out. Whew!!! To bad because this movie is still good to watch even after 30 yrs. The book it was based on is outstanding."
3,Not like the Book,"If you want to buy this movie because you don't want to read the book, you're out of luck. It is not the same as the book at all.Better start reading!"
1,Be Warned,There is no way to switch off the Chinese subtitles on this dvd. What's more they are very obtrusive - they're larger than usual and higher up on the picture.
2,A Rumor of War,This DVD is apparently in a foreign format and it will not play on my DVD; but the problem is intermittent.
2,subtitles,guess next time i will do more reading before buying im not really pleased that i have to watch the subtiles in another country language and cant turn them off
2,a wonderful resorce for teaching simple art projects to younger kids,"This is a great book for doing easlily accomplished art projects with my kids. I homeschool a preschooler and second grader and these can be adapted to either ages. Many of the books we already have and using paint, pencils, collage, drawing, etc. we ahave been doinf once a week projects, usually related to what we are studying. For example, last week we were studying the solar system and after reading the ""Magic School Bus, Blast into The Solar System"" we learned about cartoon illustration. My seven year old thought it was great. We've also done quite a few of the other projects and have had great success. The book is user friendly with easy to follow instructions, a list of supplies, time to complete, parent involvement. It's a good book for sure."
1,gross,I expected this to be a fine more luxerious product. I opened it and it was just gross and cheap looking. I sent it back!
2,Blues Review,"Unforunately this was not one of my best purchases, as there were very few recordings in the C.D. that gave a good impression of this fantastic Blues originator."
4,missing Elmore?,"A good compulation 4 one of the blues legends a bit more care of the remix would have helped, but there are alot of songs on the disc many I hadnt heard be4, sorry I missed ya Elmore"
5,Great compilation,"I have a large collection of blues CD's, and this has remained one of my favorites for years. Elmore James doesn't get the credit he deserves for his work. He was an amazing vocalist, guitar player, and bandleader. (Also, these tracks were recorded back in the days when the whole band was recorded together for each take, which makes the results here even more amazing.) His work doesn't sound dated after all the years passed since it was recorded, and I have rarely heard the blues sung in such an impassioned voice. Just listen to ""Something Inside Me"" and you'll know what I'm talking about. This CD spans his entire career and as someone who bought it without ever hearing his music before, it is an excellent introduction to this underrated bluesman."
5,Mr James,"Elmore James was one of Jimi Hendrix' all time favorites. Jimi even went as far as calling himself Jimmy James before he named himself Jimi Hendrix. Awesome awesome awesome, a must have album and to discover Elmore James for the teenagers who like the Blues!!"
5,Very much appreciated,"I am in the process of re focusing my career, and this book has helped me to generate ideas about the moves I need to make. Dr. Harkness uses concrete examples in her work and guides you to the best path in your Life Change."
2,Average Read,"The books starts out a little slow but gets better as it goes on. I would recommend you read it if you are able to purchase the book ""used""."
4,Good serum,"I've read a bit about how good beta glucan can be for your skin. This serum leaves my skin soft, and I will buy it again."
2,no real benefit,was not very beneficial. i did not notice any changes in skin texture softness even skin tone. if you are looking for a serum i would say don't settle on this one.
3,Good Product but USB connection not standard.,"Got the device and followed the instructions for installation. Normal USB install is to boot, hot-plug the device into the running computer, and put in a floppy/CD with the appropriate device drivers when the ""new hardware"" window appears.This USB install requires software installation BEFORE plugging in, reboot the machine, COLD-plug (with the machine powered off) the device in the USB port and reboot the machine. (The smart media card MUST be in the reader at reboot to work properly.) Only then, will it work properly.Hot-plugging the device (with the machine running) does not work as most USB devices do, even after installation. And the reader MUST have a card in it at reboot time to function properly, even after installation.After all these restrictions are followed, downloads are quick with drag and drop ability. However these type of requirements are not normal for USB devices."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Flawed drivers -- not compatible with Windows98(2d Ed). I have had experiences similar to the Reviewer: ""An electronics fan from Chicago."" I wish I read that review, first! If the device is left plugged into the USB port, Windows98(2d Ed) wets the bed at bootup. The Tech support is a long distance call, weekdays during normal business hours. The support information is printed among the other hype on the box -- throw away the manual, but don't forget to read the fine print on the box! I wasted many hours trying to get the USB to function properly before I pulled the box from the trash and found www.newmediatechcorp.com listed as a website. Then, I wasted another couple hours trying to get the newer drivers to work. For the time being, I've given up -- I'll just have to remember to unplug the thing when I put the computer to bed -- or I'll find Film Reader USB has left a blue puddle on my screen in the morning."
3,No XP driver,The unit worked very well with Win9X but when I changed to XP I found that the driver would not work and so far I haven't been able to locate one.
3,DEVICE IS DEAD,"An old film reader... bulky but works well otherwise. However, I had to reinstall it on Win2000 and the install failed. I have the old installation files and they failed too. I looked for a new driver and read that the company went out of business. Found a driver (which was the same set of files that I already had). Install may work for you, but as it is a really old device, and there are many better ones on the market, I suggest you use the latter."
1,Not Win2k Compatable!,"I can't believe a ""New Media"" USB product is not compatable with win2k. I got about 2 months use out of this product before it became obsolete. Dont make the same mistake!"
4,Iron Yoga,Be prepared for the yoga work-out. The one that you will not repeat everyday. Don't just buy the c d if you never did yoga before.
3,Not enough to keep me interested,"This DVD is worth it if you want to add something challenging to your Yoga Practice. However, it didn't keep me interested enough. I only used it two or three times. Trust me, it wasn't because I mastered the ""iron yoga"" practice, it was just kind of boring. I take yoga classes at a studio, one to two times a week, and I guess I just prefer the real life interaction between instructor and student."
2,Not yoga,"I bought this because I thought it would be challenging, but have only used it twice. It's just not fun and when I am looking for power yoga I will still go to my old standby Baron Baptiste. This instructor has no personality and is just not enjoyable to follow."
3,Was okay,"This tape was okay but in my opinion, it moved too slowly. I prefer Rodney Yee's flowing style to this."
3,Too slow,"I felt like the yoga moves were done too slow. However, if I weren't so impatient I should have stuck with this because I did feel ""the burn"" the next day."
5,Great DVD,"I've been doing some really high impact workouts - weights and resistance bands. The kind of workouts that leave you exhausted, sweaty and sore. This is the equal of any of them.The combination of balance and weight training is amazing. If you're looking for one of those body blasting aerobic workouts, this isn't it. If you want a great full body workout to invigorate, strenghten and build lean muscles, this is the one.I don't recommend just jumping in and starting. Do the routines without weights a couple times, build up to it then add weights and work up to the moderate, then advanced poses."
2,Iron Yoga,"I have to be honest, I've only used this DVD twice. I found it to be very boring and unmotivating. It wasn't a good strength workout and it wasn't a good yoga workout. They tried to combine the two and it didn't work for me. When I do yoga I feel a sense of well-being and my body feels like it has benefitted from head to toe. This didn't give me that feeling at all! When I lift weights, I can definately feel that I have accomplished something and my muscles are fatigued. This video didn't do that for me either. Maybe it works for some people, but I didn't enjoy it. Also, I think you have to be careful in some of the poses with the added weight.....careful not to put more strain on your lower back."
4,Pretty good,"This is just like traditional yoga but there is a twist - you use light dumbbells. This adds to the already toning effect that yoga has on you. They use very controlled movements making you aware of every breath you take and awareness of your body. Because of the weights, it's really very challenging, but hey - everyone needs to challenge themselves every now and then right? This is tough but there are great results in store if you use this often."
1,Do not buy this product,I decided for a weekend project to redo my coffee table. I sanded the table and applied wood conditioner as instructed. I used a nice brush and applied the Polyshade stain and finish. It looked terrible. It was uneven and gloppy. It was impossible to get an even coat. I decided to let it dry and sand it out. I used the regular Minwax stain and it worked great. Don't waste your money or your time with this product.
1,DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT!!!,"Do not buy this product. I spent several thousand dollars putting up very nice wood paneling and I used this product for the finish. It is now pretty much ruined. First of all it runs. No matter how hard you try, it will run on any verticle surface. I called the manufacterer and the guy said that it's not suppose to be used for verticle surfaces, but it doesn't say that on the can or any brochure. Second, after you sand all the drip lines it leaves you with bare spots, then you have a very blotchy finish. Third, it will take at least three coats, probably many more, to look somewhat acceptable, but it still looks like ?#$%. You are much better off with one coat of a high quality stain, then one coat of poly."
1,Polyshades Frustrations,"I have just finished assembling a pine blanket chest to keep at the foot of the bed. I selected Miniwax Polyshades, thinking that it would save time, as advertised to finish the chest. This product was a great dissapointment. It is not really a stain as stated on the the product, It is more like a ""dirty"" varnish. The particles of pigment do not stain the wood. The particles remain suspended in the varnish, which makes it almost impossible to obtain a uniform finish with a brush. Where the application is thicker it is darker. I found it almost impossible to obtain a uniform finish with this product. The results were totally un-acceptable (I did follow all instructions to the letter). Now I am considereing , dis-assembling the chest, sanding everything and painting it. Hours of work ahead of me to fix this problem!! No time saving here! If you want to avoid a bad experience, do not use this product."
4,a good twist,"After sharing this movie with the family, My niece went from Naive to nervous! Ladies beware. Fellows be on the alert, if it looks crooked, it probably is!"
5,Sisters Be- WARE!,This movie is great! Reality check for brothers on the Down Low. Aids don't discriminate so get tested and rap it up.
5,A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!!,"I was blown AWAY!!!! This movie was the best movie I have seen in a very, VERY, long time. COVER is a must see/must own movie.I can't imagine a person not liking this movie - but if you love it or hate it you will definitely talk about it."
4,"Good Movie, Subject Matter is Important to Address","This was a great movie! The subject matter is definitely one that needs to be addressed. I emailed all my close friends/email buddies after finding the movies site and told them to check it out. So many times we look past the issues that affect us the most. Women, be careful! Men, be honest! Times have changed and we have come to far. If we don't love ourselves, no one else will.Ms. Ellis was great in this movie. I wish she'd get more offers as she has talent. Lou Gossett was good as usual. Mr. Duke did a good job in my opinion. This is definitely a movie to watch."
5,Uncovered,"It's about time!This thought provoking film was long overdue. It is well acted, poignant and educational. Every woman, no, everybody should see this movie."
5,SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE BIG SCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bill Duke is awesome, I'm glad he brought this subject matter to the surface. There have been many docu's about this taboo in our society, but not with a movie the cast was excellent, WHY wasn't this movie on the big screen, this is a real issue in our society. I don't want to give away to much about the movie, but it is a must see, it shows how our community live in a delusional world we can't even brace ourselves for what is real, and be honest about REAL LIFE we are quick to judge then to deal waht is really real, anywho because I know I'm rambling The movie was excellent and I'm spreading the word like its a forest fire because the movie is HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTT!"
4,"Good Movie, Don't Miss It!","This straight to DVD movie stars Aunjanue Ellis, Vivica A. Foxx, Louis Gossett Jr., Clifton Davis, Leon and other great actors. It's sort of a murder mystery/drama. Lots of plot twists and ""Ooooh Snap!"" moments. If I say too much it'll ruin it for you. I can tell you that Aunjanue Ellis plays the main character and she's the prime suspect of a murder. Who did she murder? Was she really the one who did it? See this movie and find out."
5,All I can say is WOW,"Wow!!! This movie is a must see...You will not want to leave your seat trying to follow this suspense, shocking thriller....it is a definate story that needs to be told and I am so glad that I got a chance to see it...5 stars!!!!"
1,Unreliable,"The remote couldn't manage to keep my TV turned on - it would turn it on with my receiver and DVD player, and then turn the TV back off again. I had to hit the ""help"" key to get it to reset the TV every time. Using the debugging logic on the website never worked. I returned the product and will keep looking for something more reliable."
2,It is DEAD!,"Unfortunately (or fortunately!) I received this as a Rewards program gift, because after 1 1/2 years it now seems to be toast. I do not believe that I could recommend this remote because of the following issues:One, after about 3 months it started having the typical problems charging. Two, even after firmware updates it never recognized our TV's input scheme correctly (driving my wife and kids mad!). Three, 6 months ago one of the most common buttons just popped out. Four, out of the blue it first would not charge and then it goes through a testing routine and shuts off. USELESS.It should be noted that there seem to be a multitude of remanufactured remotes out there. READ RETURNS! And I could not imagine paying nearly $300 for this either. Maybe $150. With a 3 year unlimited warranty."
1,harmony 890 review,"A good idea gone wrong.Build quality poor for the price, erogonomics sacrificed for design.Software tied to a website which is simply not functional. Could not get beyond registration with the initial setup, and I am not a newbie with computers."
1,Avoid Harmony Remotes - Malicious code gets installed on your computer,I had one and returned it. Even after uninstalling in Control Panel (no other way to uninstall per the manufacturer) months later I am still seeing bits and pieces of the installation utility when I run links from emails which have nothing to do with the remote software. There is no way to safely remove all components. Avoid all companies which install spyware or any other malicious code as part of using their products. I have saved screenshots of the messages which come up. Email me at Malcolm.Shaw@Cox.net for proof.
2,device needs improvement.,"One of it advertising pluses turns out to be one of the devices weakness, NO MACRO FUNCTIONS. Also the buttons are small and hard to press. There is no positive feeling after pressing a button. The activity functions are OK, It seems like such a small step to have a Device function also, but no dice. Knowing what I know now I would not purchase this unit."
3,Convenient,"I purchased this for a Christmas gift for my son. He loves it, when it charges. The charger is a bad design. The remote has to be weighted to get a charge. This is a problem with other cradles also, apparently they are redesigning it. Other than that, he loves it. Said if you don't know much about computers, you may have a hard time setting up. Once it was set up, and charged, it was awesome."
