4,"Hear me out, please!!!","Please don't get mad at me for only putting four stars for a production of ""Le Nozze Di Figaro"" that has Te Kanawa as the countess and Von Stade as Cherubino. They are absolutely perfect, and most of the cast is, too. However, I was dissapointed with this when I watched it because I hadn't realized that it would be an actual movie. It just didn't have the opera feel to it because it was not filmed on stage. Also they did special ""effects"" like flashbacks and things, and having the singers ""think"" their arias. I was so mad that ""Se Voi Ballare"" wasn't actually sung!!!! The whole point of opera is that it's the one place where people can voice their thoughts vocally and no one else will hear! So the costuming and settings are lavish and lovely and the singers first-rate, but this is a movie, not a staged production."
4,All one would expect,"Overall an excellent Figaro, though not as well-acted as I hoped. For an older recording it looks and sounds great. I only wish the New York City Opera Sep 1991 Figaro televised on PBS were available on DVD, with interviews by Hugh Downs and a much better acted (though non-famous) cast. I thought the Count was especially good in this production. Kiri fans should be quite pleased as well."
2,The Best,The entire cast is superb..the acting is superb ...the singing is superb....and they are all so young !I marvel at how they manage to sing so beautifully and convey the story - on such a small stage. Pritchard's orchestra does a great job supporting the singers rather than drowning them out.
2,Not really about filmmaking,"Perhaps the reason they don't teach those 161 things in film school is because they're really not about filmmaking. For the most part the book is about guerrilla marketing, and fundraising. These come after, and are important. But don't expect an underground guide to making film - it's not that."
4,"Lots of good ideas, with a few pointless ones snuck in.","I can say this is the best film book I have yet read (of only three!). Haveing produced a few independent shorts myself, I can say that the authors got their material from the hard, chaotic, and fun world of no-budget films. You can save a lot of headaches and ruined footage by following their advice.Most of it anyway, there are a few that seem like they were thrown in just for padding. And despite that, the book is still too short."
2,All filler very little killer,"An entire page was dedicated in given you the recipe on how to bake cookies...I'm not kidding, it's there!Apart from atrociously redundant information littered through this book that has little to do with actual film making. There are still a few gems dispersed in it. If you're masochistic enough to read the entire thing then it might be worth it.If you're really really into making movies then don't waste your time and money (I wasted the former cause I'm sick like that) buying this book. Buy a book you can actually learn something from."
2,Headlines are ok...,"I was expecting to see ""HOW"".This book is merely a ""psychological boost"":""Yes! You Can Do It!""But that's all about it. You can just read the headlines or have someone read them for you.If you want to read it because you want to ""make your own movie no matter what"" (it's on the front cover), you will be disappointed."
4,Excellent book,"the place i got it from gave it to me in a really good condition. The book itself is fascinating. I've read half of it since i got it and it's so full of humorous information. It is a good book to read if you want to be a filmmaker. The main theme, Just Do It."
1,I think the 5 star reviews were from the authors' friends & family.,"I received this book as an X-mas gift and have been reading it over the past week. There is absolutely no way those 5 star reviews are from anyone other than friends/family of the authors. This is, by far, one of the worst written books I've read in a long time. It also contains myriads of terrible advice. There is a quote on the front of the book from Caty Konrad (producer of Scream and Girl, Interrupted) stating: ""full of great insight and common sense"". This is an accurate statement, in as far as to say that this book is full of common sense stuff... So, skip the book, use a bit of common sense, and you'll be better off with the money in your pocket. Better yet, buy a good book."
1,Fun but Useless,If you want something that might motivate you to make a film..-_- then go ahead and buy it... but dont expect to learn anything useful.
3,Pretty good,"This book was pretty good. It's a collection of hints and tips and secrets for the film biz. I was definatelly written more for the professional doing this for a living, not some youngn like me. It did have some handy tips though, and it was an enjoyable read."
4,What They Don't Teach You at Film School,"This book has a lot of sound advice for filmmakers. It will motivate you to make films and keep making them. I found it gets a little to ""LA"" for me towards the end. I felt like they really let you into their minds, and if this is what women think... Heh, get this book! I enjoyed it."
1,Totally useless,"Thanks God, they don't teach you THAT in film school! Endless, girlish blah-blah-blah... It's a shame, especially when authors, according to a photo at the end of the book, passed the teenage stage a long time ago! I don't even want to be more specific! It's already way too much time I spent on this garbage... The only reason I am writing it is to warn you, Filmmaker - it has no information you are looking for."
1,Poorly manufactured,"Poorly manufactured. The instructions for assembling the electronics is OK, except for the part about mounting the electrolytic compositors. We put them in backwards at first. The electronic explanations are just wrong at points, but I guess OK for a basic introduction. But what is the worst is the plastic design. It is truly hard to put on the wheels and the parts do not fit well. The steering does not work well, bad design."
3,"Great film, awful subtitles","The film it's self is a masterpiece but, literally half of the subtitles are in the vhs. Many full scenes in the films are missed due to missing subtitles. This work of art needs a proper releasing!"
1,You get what you pay for....,"I've only used two of the bits, both broke after a few uses. Cheap all the way around, buyer beware."
5,"Great value, beautiful desk, very impressed. Exceeds Expectations","Beautiful desk, great value for price. I am very impressed with this item. I would certainly reccommend this desk to anyone in the market for a new desk, you wont be disappointed..."
5,The Best Procol Harum Album Ever,"It took me a long time to find this album on CD, previously only had the vinyl and took it all over the world with me. The CD is engineered very well, a clean recording. The only thing that could have been better is if this album had been released on DVD-Audio or SACD in a true 5.1 mix. This album was originally produced in quad-4 so a remix to 5.1 would be easy and fantastic."
5,One of the very few...,"This is one of the very few rock band/orchestra LP's(Cd's) that was NOT A TOTAL DISASTER!I would say that this is a total success,and one heck of a Procol Harum release.Now you can listen to this masterpiece without the crackles,and enjoy a live bonus track from the very concert that produced the original LP...Awww,you LUCK DOGS!!!Come on now...""GO FETCH!"""
4,Conquistador's on this one,"The live version of Conquistador here is so much better than the studio version. If the CD had nothing else on it, it'd still be good. The salty Dog version here is very good, too, but the live Conquistador here is the highlight for me. Rest of album isn't bad either."
5,One of the best!,"This recording goes back to when I listened to it on 8-track tape, then moved to cassette, and finally it is available on CD format. Don't miss this piece of history. It was especially good if you had a ""Quad"" system, you could actually hear the seagulls flying overhead during Salty Dog. Procol Harum has never sounded more tight and harmonic as they do with the Edmonton Symphony."
4,a pleasant surprise,"I bought this album on a whim in a used cd shop. I've listened to it several times now and I like it more each time, especially ""Beyond the Beginning"" and ""Come Out Tonight"". Jeffrey Gaines has a handsome, earthy voice and sings about romance in a sincere, non-cheesy way. I highly recommend this album, especially for anybody who likes Freedy Johnston, another underrated singer-songwriter."
3,Good Read!,"If you enjoy Susan Carroll's series The Dark Queen, etc...you see in this story how her writting has evolved. Enjoyable mystery/romance."
5,The Hook hooked me in!,"I turely enjoyed this book from being to end. No one is safe to walk the streets of London at night. The Hook Is out! Yet Lady Ann dares to walk them in pursuit of her young daughter Norie. She would do anything to recover her from the man who took her. Even if she has to make a deal with the devil, the Marquis of Mandell. The man with the heart of ice and manners of a rake. Together they will Embark on an adventure of almost endless peril. As the learn it's never to late to love."
4,A beautiful CD,"This is a delightful cd. It's a mixture of instrumental and vocal tracks, evoking the magic of Bolivia. It enhances the spirits and was really uplifting after a stressful day. I bought it 'blind' as I don't have any speaker facility on my pc and was not disappointed.I really recommend this."
4,Wrestle Mania 10 Oh Yeahhhhhh,"This event truley was a classic. First with Owen vs Bret! Wow the best technical wrestling since Flair vs. Savage 92""! The ladder match was awsome too. Yoko was in the best condition of his carreer at 560 lbs. Luger vs Yoko - 7/10 Bret vs Yoko 9/10Ladder Ramon vs Hbk-10/10 and so was Hart vs Hart. I wish undertaker was a part of this classic. I would of let him beat YOKo in the Main Event and have Luger vs Hart for the # 1 contendership!The Tag title match and the Mixed tag were both a waste of my time. Savage vs Crush was different but good and entertaining.Overall a 90% or 9/10- great effort and really showed WCW that WWE was dominate"
5,The Ladder Match Rocked!!!!!!!!,The ladder match between Shawn and Razor had to be the best match I had ever seen! Definetly 5 stars.
4,contains two classic WWF matches,Bret -v- Owen & the Razor Ramon -v- Shawn Micheals Ladder Match are as good as the WWF gets ... from there it's mostly filler.
2,not 1 great match on this tape,ok 1st off this is not the best ladder match might have ben great back then but not that good now. watch jeffhardy vs rvd ss01 or jeffhardy vs undertaker.main events were bad.opener was ok.
4,contains two classic WWF matches,Bret -v- Owen & the Razor Ramon -v- Shawn Micheals Ladder Match are as good as the WWF gets ... from there though it's mostly filler.
4,it is what it says it is.,"smells good. just note that this version (lavender) does not contain alcohal like the lemon version does. i use witch hazel as an aftershave, so i prefer the lemon version. all in all a good product."
1,Updike has nothing to say and he is saying it,"This is bad pornography populated by stick-figures. Not that there's anything wrong with stick-figures, mind you. The problem is: these characters aren't supposed to be stick-figures. They're supposed to be 3D characters. Updike threw in the computer stuff for 2 reasons. He wanted to somehow dignify the pornography. And he wanted to impress you with his computer-knowledge. I'm impressed by Updike's indefatigable shallowness and that's about it."
1,Putrid,"If I could, I would give this piece of vomitus trash less than one star. The adjectives I use to describe this attempt at writing are revolting, disgusting, crude, vulgar, offensive, etc. I could go on but I think you get my point. The impression I have of the author is a man who hates women & is against marriage.At least I didn't have to buy the book."
3,More Updikia,"This is a bit disappointing from John Updike, who writes consistently beautiful prose here as elsewhere.I guess the thing that's increasingly putting me off his stories is his habit of learning some stuff and shoving it into his work so that we can see he learned some stuff. I'm thinking particularly of a short story he did a few years ago about a banjo player touring Russia. The story is sprinkled liberally (whenever something is sprinkled, I guess it's ""liberally"") with supposedly insider opinions about banjo styles and other bluegrass arcana.I'm a bluegrass banjo player, and I found it a bit tiresome to have someone appropriate superficial tidbits for gratuituous inclusion in a story; I didn't think the detail added anything, and found it distracting. I wonder if serious math people might react similarly to this novel.Apart from that, this novel seems to be working in old, possibly depleted soil for someone of John Updike's greatness as a writer."
1,Pardon me for yawning...,"I have listened to the first 45 minutes of Villages, and as of yet, I haven't come across anything in the way of interesting plot -- or *any* plot for that matter. So far, it seems to be just tedious exposition. I can see why people speak of Updike's keen observations and his poetic use of language, etc. However, this book is not my cup of tea. My interest in the characters, places, periods described simply has not been piqued, not after nearly an hour of listening. This will be one of the rare pieces of literature that I shall leave unfinished."
3,Better written than spoken,"Villages, by John Updike, is a better read than audio presentation. The authors greatest strength is in description and, for some reason, this is lost when spoken. It was good and it was boring at the same time. I could only about 1/2 of each disc at a sitting. It is too bad because Updike is a master but sometimes he gets lost in his own ego and forgets that the reader does not want to linger too long in each phase of his life or theirs."
2,"Story of Sexual Experiences, but devoid of Passion!","I was in college when John Updike published ""Rabbit Redux"" but I never read it. I may read it to compare it to the disappointing ""Villages"".Since I haven't read any of Updike's novels, I felt it was about time. The brief and humorous description of Cabot City (Beverly) and Haskell's Crossing (Prides Crossing/Bev. Farms) made it momentarily interesting. However, my dislike of the main character, Owen, made it painful. One would think that the sexual escapades of a successful businessman might be a quick read, but it was just the opposite. Owen lacked passion in his extracurricular activities, or for that matter anything in his life. The one character that I liked, the first wife Phyllis, was ""accidently""(suicide?) killed driving to meet her divorce attorney. I don't think Updike was fond on his main character, Owen, and the writing reflects it.I enjoy a good read, and this wasn't one."
2,Disappointing and forgetable,"Slogging through the hero's sex life was pretty tedious, and there wasn't much else here."
4,well documented account,"This book contains many first-hand accounts of people who knew the Ridgerunner, and paints a well-defined picture of an enigmatic man who seemed at odds with civilization. The Ridgerunner lived an incredible life in a place that was very remote and hardscrabble, hiking dozens of miles daily, year round, through some of the steepest and toughest mountain country in the world. They called him the ""human coyote,"" and he was whip smart but quite neurotic. What would have made this a 5-star book is the addition of some good photos and maps of the gorgeous, rugged areas in Idaho where the Ridgerunner lived in the forest. There are photos, just not very many, and only one rough map."
3,Not as interesting as I thought it would be,"Super neat idea, but the dude is kind of a dud. Quirky and ornery for sure, but the character and the story aren't all they were cracked up to be. If you haven't bought this yet I recommend getting this from the library."
4,Great First Person History,"Emerson Hough was a great Iowa writer who wrote about his own times, those of the Wild West! He keeps to the bare facts and was trying not to embellish his accounts of the outlaws. Even so, these stories are very vivid and colorful. I enjoy Hough's personal input on the subject of law and order (he thought the law, in his day, was ill-equipped to handle the ""bad men"") and it is interesting that he rode with Pat Garrett and others. I recommend this book to any western fan."
3,Good overview of the wild west,"The author certainly has done his research and knows his history. He provides a vast amount of information and mentions many, many ""bad"" men, almost an overwhelming number of them; in fact, many are mentioned in passing without any real depth. I felt the author threw out too many statements without giving sufficient background to make the statements seem factual, though I know they were indeed factual. I think he covered a vast number of desperadoes, maybe too many, and should have cut the list down to give more depth to those covered. Overall, it's still a good read on the old west, just don't rely on it as your only source."
4,Interested on how it really was?,A plausible narative on life where lawmen were few and far between. These are the lives that were exploited and exaggerated for dime novels. Interesting.
4,Want silky feeling skin??,"This just didn't last long enough. It is good and easy to use and does a great job of getting the make up off. It leaves your skin feeling silky, has a nice fragrance and it is a good product. It is amazing what all you can buy on Amazon."
1,WARNING ALL HORROR FANS,"A truly poor film. I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters and the film would have been greatly improved if they had all been massacred by the man it the rubber suit that was supposed to look like a wooden carving. By the way, how many wooden carvings do you know that blink! The main male character was the worst of all and made me want to plunge my hand into the TV screen and strangle him. The acting didn't make up for any of the other dissapointments; particularly the acting from that guy who was trying to pull off an English accent."
1,I saw that movie and i wanted to warn you: IT TOTALY SUCKS!!,hello all horror fans! i wanted to warn you about this movie!: its the wors movie ever!!!!!!!!. common people! in that movie there are 30 years old actors playing 16 year olds! and they suck at it!the movie is about a stupid woden doll that killes some 16 (or mybe 30) years old kids in halloween!how can that movie be good!!!!DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS A WEAST OF MONEY AND TIMEDONT RENT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (SAME REASONS)OR DONT SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! TOAL WEAST OF TIME!THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 1 STAR IS BEACUSE I KNOW WHAT ITS REALLY HARD TO MAKE A MOVIE (EVEN A BAD ONE...)BUY THE MOVIE VALENTINE INSTEAD!
5,Sir Army Suit,"It's about time that the powers that be have realised what I think is the BEST Klaatu disc of all time.. From the first song all the way to the last, this disc will have you humming with every song. Mister Manson is my favorate of all. It will make you wonder why this group never made it big.. I can't wait and turn my friends on to this GREAT disc..It's a can't miss.. Just go to their web site to get it before amazon sells it."
5,"Canadian Beatles...if you like the Fab Four, you'll love it!","Like many Beatle fans in the 60's and 70's, I wore out a lot of vinyl re-listening to my favorite platters. Then, when I got to college, years after the break-up of the Fab Four, someone turned me on to Klaatu. They are just as imaginiative and innovative as the Beatles, and if you didn't know any better you'd swear that the songs are written and performed by them. Furthermore, you might suspect that George Martin was sitting in the producer's chair. I promise you that if you liked the Beatles, Klaatu will be like finding undiscovered treasures from Apple archives."
2,This is not Gila Window Film,"I installed this on a window right next to another window that has Gila (light) window film on it (bought at Home Depot in Gila packaging). It looks noticeably different. If you go to Gila's website, it says they do not make light window film in a 48"" length. This might be heat control window film, but it is NOT Gila, as the description implies. It arrived in a generic plastic tube, not Gila packaging."
3,Visually Stunning,"If you loved the movie and you collect movie memorabilia, this book is anecessity. The photo reproductions are beautiful and the text is good. I would have liked more coverage and background of the principal stars of the film though. This though is a minor complaint. Recommended."
1,This book featured on Awful Library Books,I don't advocate book burning so I will just recommend all copies get turned into compost. This book is useless at best. There are many other better written books dealing with childhood trauma out there for adults. Kids should NEVER see this book ever it is too scary and too confusing. Whether you believe SRA is real or not this isn't the book to deal with the subject.
5,Hope for Young Children,"For those of us who are survivors of extreme abuse, yes, ritual abuse, this book is a God-send. If I'd had an opportunity to tell someone safe about what was happening behind closed doors at my house, perhaps the struggle to find myself as an adult wouldn't have been so difficult. I wholeheartedly disagree with D.Logue's review, in that SRA was not debunked and has been proven over and over in court cases to exist. Much of what happens in these cases is so hard for us to comprehend that we can't imagine it could be real. But it is. If this book can help one child, it deserves a five-star rating. dejoly.com"
3,Good book - but it may not be okay for children,"These crimes do happen to people. Satanic ritual abuse has happened to children and adults in different places. This book attempts to help children by letting them know about Satanic ritual abuse. When this book came out, people were trying to get this type of abuse to stop. Some people say these crimes did not happen, but they did and still do. But this book may not be okay for children. It should be read to them carefully so as not re-hurt them if they were abused this way."
1,Of all the books of the SRA hoax this is the most dangerous,A children's book about Satanic Ritual Abuse? Why? Now instead of just hearing about all the evil crimes being comitted by fictious satanists we have a book aimed specifically at children that show pictures that will go a lot farther at implanted false memories.In one SRA hoax a child who claimed to be the victim of satanists was shown to have gotten these images in his head by being read a picture Bible that shows a baby being split apart during the story of King Solomon. It appears that the entire point of this book would be to plant false memories at an even faster rate. Every copy of this book needs to be burned before all damage is done.
1,A dangerous book,"This book talks about ritual abuse in a day-caresetting. Readers should be aware that starting in1983 there have been many court cases similar innature to this book. Bakersfield CA, the McMartinPre-school, Little Rascals etc are well known.Many adults were given long jail sentences. Itis only in recent years that researchers have found that it is possible for investigators to implant false memories in the mind of youngchildren simply by asking direct questionsrepeatedly. People convicted are now having theircases reviewed and are being released from prison.There is a strong possibility that the contentof this book is based on false implanted memoires,and that the book should be considered a piece offiction rather than non-fiction"
1,Pure Insanity,I am a librarian and under no circumstances would I allow this title to be on the shelf. What a load of rubbish that will simply terrify children for no reason whatsoever. Are people deranged to actually promote this book? It is child abuse in my opinion.
1,Horrible book,"I found this book on a shelf inside a thrift store, I didn't buy it.I didn't like a single bit!I showed it to my 12 years daughter, and joking I asked her, should I buy it? Her answer was: NOOOO, this book scare me!!I showed her only because she is very mature for her age, but I don't think I could have show it to her some time ago."
2,"Slick, overpolished smooth nothingness","Found this on vinyl used at a thrift store, paid 99 cents and still feel ripped off.It was in perfect played-once condition, which shows how much its owner dug it.I like Nancy Wilson a lot but her one tune here does nothing for me, pure MOR schmaltz, like the rest of the album. Even the one funkish tune, Sweet Dreams, is nowhere near what the Crusaders were able to do on earlier records, despite a Larry Carlton solo (far from his best). Everything is over-produced, polished to a fault, and lacking any soul or grit that I can discern.Easily the weakest Crusaders album I've ever heard, of about ten.With so many unheard albums out there, I doubt I'll ever hear this again, and someone will get a used record played all of twice. Hope they don't pay more than 25 cents."
4,A solid collection,"There comes a time in the life of every pastor when it is time to face the music and preach the dreaded stewardship sermon! OK, it's not that bad - and this interesting sermon collection will provide some ideas to get you started. Mosser and Bauknight - both Methodist pastors - have assembled a solid collection of biblical sermons from a variety of preachers."
2,Not this time,"I am a huge fan of Michelle Cunnah. I have absolutely adored her last books. Unfortunately, this latest entry falls far from the mark.Cunnah usually has a way of writing her scenes that make them funny and interesting. This is not the case with this book. The opening scene is a good example.Cunnah starts off with a funny premise and then goes on and on and on and insists in describing it in minute to minute detail at which point it just becomes boring.We get that the boss is a jerk and we get that our main character is going to have to be the poor suffering soul among all the kiss ups. But for some reason, Cunnah just kept going page after page on ONE scene.It was too much and it basically set the tone, for me, for the rest of the book.I just could not get into this storyline. It felt rehashed somehow and I did not really care about the ending.I guess every author is allowed one miss and Cunnah had hers with this one."
1,Not worth the paper it was printed on...,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I tried to give it a fair shot. I tried to force myself to be interested. I really, really tried. This book wound up being the biggest piece of crap I've ever purchased.The opening scene was long, drawn-out, and just plain dull. The main character is the type of woman I despise. She's shallow, self-centered, insecure and dishonest. The ending is predictable but comforting, kind of like knowing you have just one last pull of the Band-Aid and the pain will cease.I'd only recommend this vile tome if you seek birdcage fodder."
3,Interesting and scenery is gorgeous.,Required viewing for a Religion and Cultures class for college. Eye opening and forces you to see the struggles and strengths of man-kind along with the ugly.
2,"Better, still not great.","I have more affinity for this one than the preceding work Someone Is Killing The Gay Boys Of Verona, although I really dislike the way Mark Roeder is less and less content to write from a single character's point of view. The jaw-dropping supernatural events are still here, but I suppose at this point I'm just rolling my eyes and going with the flow.Mr. Roeder, as ever, is admirable in his chutzpah, though I confess I don't hold his talents as a writer in very high esteem."
3,Beautiful,"Great style to fit our farm house. Great color match. But its screw to hold it steady keeps slipping. Also, the bar holding the paper roll is not a ""one piece unit"", rather it is two pieces with a spring between - so it almost always falls apart when putting on a new roll."
3,Beautiful hardware but unstable with wear,"We had the faucets/showerheads/controls from this line in another location and loved them. This time we added all the rods, rings, tp holder, etc. with the faucets when re-decorating specifically because it is one of the few companies that offers a complete line. We have found that they come loose often and the double road is really unstable. We finally resorted to glueing the rod in it. The line is beautiful but the hardware pieces do have a lot of projection which probably contributes to the difficulty in keeping them tight with frequent use."
3,"Great game, but poor-quality equipment","This was the first go board I ever had, about ten years ago (looks like it's still the same as it was then). The game of go itself is wonderful, and everyone should learn and teach all their friends. This equipment, though, is of poor quality and overpriced in relation to that lack of quality.The board itself is a cheap wood laminate -- I carried mine around in a backpack a few times, and the corners started coming apart. It's basically plywood, and won't survive ungentle use like a solid piece of wood will. The stones are cheap plastic things, whereas a basic set of good ceramic/glass stones are not that expensive. Lastly and most importantly, this go set is *tiny*! While that does make it more compact, it's very hard to manipulate. Fingers constantly bump the (very lightweight) stones by accident, it's hard to avoid messing up the board layout, and the whole ""feel"" of the game is lost."
3,The board is too small,"GO is a very fun game, but his board is really too small, and the stones are kind of small and light as well. If you never player GO before, you can get this one to get you started. Otherwise it's worth it getting better quality board and stones."
4,Written with Beginners in mind,"I disagree with the previous reviewer. Yes, very basic terminology is covered including PCMCIA cards, USB ports, etc. Then again, there are folks who are new to this terminology and need this information to connect their computers at home.I write computer programs for a living and yet the hardware concepts have never been my domain. I found this book useful in creating a wireless network at my home."
4,One of my favorites when I was 13,"I haven't read this book for thirty years or more. I read this one and Felson's ""Hot Rod,"" and loved them both. Both books depict 'delinquents' finding themselves through their fascination with the automobile. As I recall, the books are sort of object lessons against irresponsible driving. There is at least one deadly car wreck in each book, with one tragically taking the lives of a couple under-age boys in a 'borrowed' car. I can only remember a very small amount of the fiction I read that long ago, but certain aspects and scenes of these two books stick with me."
4,A taste of the fifties and sixties,"This is well written, and spoke to me as an early reader and rodder in my young teens. I recently re-read this after thinking about it for nearly thirty years and was amazed at how well Felsen captures the raw energy of self-possessed teens who want only one thing--wheels! Wheels mean freedom, and Felsen's descriptions of throbbing straight pipes and sagging springs, dreams of polished chrome and gracious lines, will ignite the fire in any old soul who wants to re-live the memories of their adoloscent quest for a place in the universe where rods are the key to independence and self-expression. I am now ready to pass this work along if anyone is interested, as I have lived again my youth and dreams through Felsen's words. Read and enjoy, and may someone soon make this come alive on film for everyone!"
5,Street Rod,I read this book when I was in probably 6th grade or so. I hadn't read it since (I'm 54 now....) It was a blast from the past. It reads a bit like a Hardy Boy story -- 'just a different style of writing than you see today. The book has a lesson as well -- I really enjoyed it.
1,earbud for cingular wireless phone,It worked one time and then began to give an incredible noise the next several times I tried to use it. Don't know what the problem was but suspect it was incompatible once they{Cingular} had the signal.
5,Gorgeous Look & Great Fit,"This really adds an interesting look to my bathroom. It was a quick and easy way to add a decorative touch. I bought the single switch plate and an outlet plate of the same pattern, so it really changes the look in my small bathroom.The work seems to be very well done, so only time will tell if it holds up, but it should. I would think only water will be necessary for any cleaning because of the way in which it is constructed and coated.Another point in its favor is that it fit without any problems. The only bad part was that one of the packages had glued the switch plate to the package, and I had a very hard time getting all the glue off the screw hole to fit it tight to the wall. But that was only on one package; the rest had no glue.Overall, it was a great way to add a new touch."
5,In Constant Rotation,"One of my favorite INXS albums. Certain albums grab you at certain times in your life, that is what ""Welcome to Wherever you are"" did to me. I was in Kuwait when this came out, I was happy to see a new Inxs album was out. I remember peeling back the cellophane from the case and popping it in my portable cd player, ""Questions"" came blarring across my speakers and then flowed into ""Heaven Sent"" a big smile came across my face as I sat back in my seat and enjoyed!"
3,Not as good as their 1st album,"Although there are so good tracks on this CD, overall it was not as good as I had hoped. ""Rockin with the Best"" is a good track, among a few others, but the rest are not songs I would listen to again. If you don't have their first album yet, I would recommend getting that before even thinking about buying this one."
2,Will not play on PC / MAC,"The european release of this CD will NOT play on a PC / MAC. You also can not rip the purchased tracks for use on your iPod, Zune, or similar devices. Inserting the disc in your drive will cause Windows to become unstable, and some applications may freeze or crash."
2,End of Enemies was End of Excitement,"Slow, and plodding. Nothing new, or unpredictable. Clive Cussler should have saved his rave review for another book. Totally uninteresting story of an ex-spy/assasin-Briggs Tanner, who witnesses the execution of a man he barely knows, and decides he must get involved in finding out who killed the poor man. Very few action sequences, and those there were, barely made it worth drudging through to the end.Come on, isn't that what the police are for?Suggestion...skip it, and read something else, anything else!"
5,The End of Enemies,"Great Book!! Started reading it on vacation, and could NOT put it down. He weaves the tale together like a master author, even though this is his first book. His detail was reminiscent of Clancy, and his writing reminded me of Cussler, Grisham, Coonts....I can't remember enjoying a book as much as this one the first time I read the author's work.I will pick up the newest book ASAP!"
5,Non-stop action...,"Blackwood's work is reminiscent of Clancy's best work (i.e. the stuff he used to write years ago). Like the old Clancy, the author has a talent for keeping a mindboggling number of subplots up and running full speed ahead in a literate style so often missing from books of this genre. If Blackwood can maintain this level of writing through the books that are sure to follow (most of them likely starring ""End of Enemies'"" hero, Briggs Tanner), he'll own a spot (right next to Ralph Peters) at the top of the military techno-thriller honor roll for years to come. ""The End of Enemies"" was a enjoyable rollercoaster of a read from beginning to end."
5,Fast moving and accurate,"I was hooked after the prologue and it never slowed down. As a submariner myself, I can attest to the veracity of the details Blackwood has sown throughout the book. His character Briggs Tanner is a Bond-like hero for the new millenium.Buy it, Read it, enjoy it."
4,as expected,"This bood is not available in bookstores so I was very happy that Amazon carried it. The order went smootly, as expected, and the product itself was as described."
3,"For this Genre, maybe 3 stars is low, but...","I bought this CD based on the reviews here on Amazon. Although it is still more interesting than almost anything being produced today, I found the CD to be a trifle self-indulgent, even for progressive rock. There were bits when I thought it was fantastic, and bits where I thought I might nod off. I really like ""We're Off You Know"" and ""Hope"", and every song has it's moments to be sure, but I cannot give it five stars, like EVERYONE else here. The highest praise I can give it is that I will probably buy another KLAATU CD, even though all the reviews here say HOPE is their best. And as for this sounding like it has been retrieved from the Apple archives, I don't think the Fab Four would have found it up to their standards to release this, but would rather opt to keep it in the Apple vaults."
3,"Pretty good, but not great...","Maybe my expectations are too high, or my standards, but this is a decent record, certainly not worthy of the 5 star reviews on this page. The best concept album of all time? What about Tommy, Sergeant Pepper, The Wall, Queen II, Quadrophenia, Dark Side of The Moon, etc? This CD has some good moments and some great atmosphere, but it at best rates 3 1/2 stars."
4,Easy enough...,"Easy to install. Haven't pulled anything with it yet, but it should do it's job...It isn't completely drill free, just had to widen a couple holes."
3,"Mixed bag, though recommended nonetheless","I wish I could give this anthology a higher rating. More than half of the stories were fantastic. Great examples of good pulp fiction. Very exciting stuff, with your tough, morally-ambigious detectives, and your dangerous femme fatales. Good, trashy reading. However, the anthology was seriously hampered by some of the editor's selections. A lot of the stories did not fit into the definition of what one would consider ""pulp fiction."" Plus, quite a few of the stories (usually the ones from the seventies and eighties) were simply bad--cliched and pointless. It would have been better to stick to the stories from the 30's, 40's, and 50's. The stories written in the last couple of decades were pale imitations of the older stories (the real ""pulp ficiton""). However, I still recommend this book, even though a third of it was filler."
3,Pulp Classics,"Mammoth is definitely the word. This is one thick chunk of pulp fiction, my friends. Breaks the mail box, hurts the hands, makes you feel the pain, like pulp action should.As a Pulp Era collector and researcher, I had to have it. However, as a reader, there are some definite speed bumps in this collection.Well, you can't have it all. Nevertheless, worth a read."
4,Good book!,"Shades of Grace tells the story of a woman battling with Alzheimer's disease. It shows a lot of her point of view, the first times that she notices something is wrong, the panic in not remembering where are you or what you are doing. It also shows how her family is affected.Overall it is very good. The facts and feelings about the disease seem to be very accurate. Recommended!"
5,hard to put down,"To finish this absorbing book I had to stay up too late one night. After going through the results of AD with two family members, I feel this story presented a fairly accurate picture of what can happen. At the same time I find it hard to imagine how one family member could so totally control the other family members for years. That is definitely not healthy dynamics and can lead to all kinds of future problems--as this story so aptly illustrates. With AD increasing in the senior population this is a very timely novel."
3,"wanted the book that says ladybug, ladybug","We ordered a now Fly away home since we have worn out ours. We ordered one on Amazon and the book is in good condition, but it starts out as Ladybird, Ladybird, not Ladybug, Ladybug. We wanted the Ladybug version so How do I get that one?"
1,Terminator Tools Reciprocating Saw Doesn't Cut It,"18V Cordless Reciprocating SawI bought this saw from another vendor. It would have been a good deal if the battery had held up for more than a couple months. I sawed through a few small 1"" limbs and the battery died after a minute or two of use. I put the saw away for a few days to work on other projects. A month later, I had another use for it. I decided to leave the battery on a longer charge period, thinking I had not charged it sufficiently the first time. No luck. I am past the return period and the cost to return, because of weight, is quite high--high enough that I would buy a battery if I could find one. I'll try Amazon, and see if they can help me find a battery at a reasonable price. Otherwise, this saw will make a fine doorstop or anchor.PS: The Amazon price is awfully high for a no-name brand. I would never pay this high a price, especially for a questionable product (Made in China, of course)"
1,A bit flimsy.,"I bought two of these for a trip to Central America. Within two uses, both suffered some sort of failure that prevented the umbrella from locking open. It took some fiddling to get one of the umbrellas working again, the other never resumed operability. Turned out I could easily have purchased better umbrellas for less at my destination. Ended up using Coleman plastic ponchos that we had taken along as backup. they were more useful."
4,small and easy to take along,Overall I like this umbrella - It's a little hard to get the velcro to reach to close it up. Also when it was advertised it said assorted colors and I never got a coice of colors so I got black.
3,Uneven Response to MYTH OF CHRISTIAN UNIQUENESS,"This is a collection of essays intending a (more or less) orthodox response to an earlier anthology that cast doubt on the uniqueness of Christianity and argued for a pluralistic approach to religion. As in any collection, some essays are better than others. The two texts are a nice one-two punch. My own take is that the defenders of Christian uniqueness don't fare as well as the attackers. Some Christians have taken the (to my mind) self-defeating route of post-modernism to defend the particularity of Christian faith. There is no such thing as objective truth, so you might as well believe in Christianity. This is perhaps an unfair summary, but I believe that it's their position. But don't take my word for it. Read THE MYTH OF CHRISTIAN UNIQUENESS and this response and decide for yourself."
2,i would not buy this again,"very big fan of the poetry but as far as lit biographies this is the most boring one I have ever read, i have had the book on my self for years and still have not finished it."
5,A Stupendous Percussion Virtuoso in the Ga Tradition!,"The exquisite quality of Mustapha Tettey Addy's drumming skills is consonant with the richly eclectic traditions of other legendary Ghanaian drummers from the Ga tribe of Accra, Ghana. Others in this rich pantheon of Ga drummers whose skills encompass all the rich percussion traditions of Ghana include the venerable Guy Warren or Kofi Ghanaba and his son Allotey Ghanaba. The extent of Tettey Addy's virtuosity is manifested in the degree of mastery he demonstrates in the equally rich but quite different drumming traditions of the Ashanti, Ewe, Fanti, and northern tribes of Ghana. Equally poignant is the transition from archaic traditional percussion music associated with very serious traditional rituals to the more exciting pieces of popular street music such as the kpanlogo riffs on this album. Tettey Addy's work in this fine album is an obvious must in the collection of any person with an interest in percussion, African, or World music."
3,Sitar music,This is a Christmas gift.I have purchased many sitar and meditation CDs from Amazon. They have all been good.
2,"Good, but...","This was really interesting and had some cool ideas, but it was trying way too hard to be funny. You ever spend time with someone who won't stop making wise cracks? They keep going on and on with little remarks that are supposed to be witty, but aren't? That's this book."
1,Editor Wanted,"The much ballyhooed y2k disaster never came to pass, but that's not what bothers me about Bob Bridges. Nor does it trouble me that the author is trudging down the same paths that have been well-worn by other authors. I don't really expect original ideas anymore; I'm too old for that. The problem with Bob Bridges is its forced, cheeky style and the use of strange narrative techniques, such as an extended passage written as an interview transcript. What Bob Bridges really needs is not another reviewer, but one editor."
5,a tour de farce!,"I'll never look at things the same again! What a tour defarce! Then, just as I finish your book, the same day speaking onNPR is the Australian woman (name...Helen...Caldicott? I can't remember) about how the nuclear arsenal has to be de-couled or Y2K will be the end of the world. Well, between the two of you you've made an activist of me. I'm going to be getting involved in this...I'm damn scared! I'll also be recommending the book. Bravo!"
5,Really good walking bass primer,"I thought this book would be really easy when I read the other reviews, but it is not that piece of cake: it is actually a wlaking bass primer, but you have to put effort in feeling comfortable with the voicings and the bass playing. It is quite practical and it doesn't deal much with rambling: it goes to the point. Recommended!(I bought this book through ADG Productions website)"
5,Good start to a great series!,"Most people dont like this episode of the Simpsons, but they probably dont know that this is the first ever episode. The drawings may be a little crude, but the episode itself is a very funny and entertaining one!"
5,It's Very Good!,"I loved this, the Simpsons has to be the funniest cartoon family and this is a great Christmas episode, I love the part at the school's Christmas pageant when Bart wrecks Jingle Bells with the silly and slightly rude Batman version and I love how they explained how they first got Santa's Little Helper. I very highly recommend this video to any Simpsons fan who also loves Christmas cartoons!"
5,A great episode,Hello you might think youve seen this episode your sayin to yourself its on tv wrong it contains scenes that never showed on tv its called syndication they remove scenes to leave room for commercials i will pinpoint the scenes the school christmas pageant is extended by 1 min and 10 seconds and there is a scene where the marges sisters say to marge where is homer and they have a talk about how come he is gone so long it is 50 seconds so it extends the episode by 2 min.Buy it youll love the deleted scenes
3,Happy happy holidays...,"The pilot episode of perhaps the greatest animated show ever! It certainly has changed quite a bit since then, but this release is still pretty good. A nice introduction to the family, AND a chance to cash in on the holiday season by releasing a Xmas special video! God bless us, everyone!"
3,Not the best Simpsons episode,"This episode describes how the Simpsons obtained their dog - Santa's Little Helper. Christmas was comming up, Marge took Lisa and Bart to the mall to buy presents. Bart decided that a great present for mom would be a tatoo (I love mom). He got it (2 letters were missing), but Marge took him to a clinic to remove the tatoo and they spent all their Xmas money doing that. Homer did not get his Xmas bonus at the nuclear plant and tried to earn money being Santa at the mall. He earned $13.??, went to bet on a dog race to make some, $, lost it, but brought back Santa's Little Helper, which turned out to be a great present for the kids. There are a few quotable and sharp phrases, but less than in the other episodes. Also, the whole episode is a little bit sad."
5,"A Funny, Informative, Entertaining and Beautiful Book!","I have read many books on Hollywood style as I am a fan of the movies but this book is now my absolute favorite! Schreier puts a very entertaining twist on Hollywood style that not only taught me a few things but also made me laugh out loud. I was so sad when the book ended - I just wanted more! This book is great for anyone who has an interest in Hollywood fashion, the movies or simply anyone who just wants to be entertained. I highly recommend Schreier's book!"
1,The Enquirer seems reputable compared to this drivel.,"Again, someone who is relying on old outdated myths and legend has written a book for sensationalism. Shreier's treatment of Clara Bow and Marion Davies is shameful to say the least considering all the facts that have been unearthed in recent years regarding both ladies. Bow triumphed at Fox with her two final films, and it was HER OWN idea to retire to Nevada with her rancher husband Rex Bell; Fox begged Clara to stay. Davies was one of the most gifted and well loved clowns of her era. She is accumulating a wealth of latter day fans who are discovering this fact. While stifled under some of the more lofty productions hoisted on her by Hearst, Marion was brilliantly funny in many films and also retired (as many of the leading ladies did at the time) when she hit 40. If you pick up this book, please read Shreier like Mother Goose, either way it's all fantasy. Let's try to find the real facts when proposing to talk about other peoples lives."
2,Nero saved rome?,Nero did nothing good for Rome nor did he save Rome. He was pure evil. Don't buy this.
3,Not the Best Fullmoon Pictures best but cool.,I saw this a long time ago.I think in 1997.And all I really remember was that it's a western and a science fiction movie all in one big Sci-Fi Western flick.Not really would entertain kids.Teens and mostly adults.
4,Oblivion,"A classic for the fans of B-movies. The acting is overdone, the effects are cheesey, and the story is almost good."
1,"Brings new mwaning to the word ""Idiotic.""","Okay, this movie....oh man. This horrible clash of genres features over the top and under the top acting, idiotic characters, ""special"" Effects that are none too impressive and is the worst thing Isaac Hays has ever been involved with. Seriously, this is one ripe for MST3K, folks. Buy it only to torture yourself or other people. I have a long, curse-filled, spiteful review on my website, but I can't post the URL here so whatever. If you are going to buy, BUY USED. Do not waste any extra money on this thing. Spend it on a bag of Oreos or something instead. You'll be glad you did."
1,Big Disappointment,"The Mini Honker Sesame Street character is advertised for $29.99. Because my grandson is obsessed with Sesame Street characters I thought I would buy him this plush toy, despite the price, to complete his collection. I assumed that the cost would at least be indicative of a toy of substantial size and quality. The plush character that I received is about 6"" tall and is akin to something you might win at a carnival game, when everyone is a winner. I was charged $10.99 plus $5.82 for shipping, with no explanation about the advertised price or the one I was charged and no directions for it's return. I'VE BEEN HAD!!! The item is not even worth what it would cost me to return it. The bottom line is I would never order anything from this merchant, Town Square Toys,"" again!!! They misrepresented their item, marked its price incorrectly, and then had the nerve to charge me $10.99, when the same item on their website is $7.99."
2,Product inferior,Length:: 0:10 MinsThe product provided to me was Lumistick. I am using the sticks for Halloween. I did some sampling and found bubbles causing white spacing in the glow. Have done this before and have purchased sticks with consistent color. Re-sellers should identify the manufacturer.
4,perfect,"great colors, most of them worked (a few duds), great price for the amount I received. Used at a party and they were a hit!"
4,Great value,"I agree that these are not the brightest glow sticks on the market, but I will continue to buy them since they are an unbelievable value! There's a huge variety of colors, which makes it fun for the kids. 8"" is a perfect size for bracelet, and 2 or 3 for a necklace. I have only found one or two that didnt glow. At this price, we open up a tube when we have friends with kids over, and let them have at it! they like to play TRON tag outside at night. For this price, you don't have to be stingy with them."
4,Glow Sticks,"This is a fun product. We connected three at a time to make necklaces rather than using one as a bracelet. We found that it was somewhat difficult for kids to make the bracelet, as the connectors would occasionally split."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought these for me kids and have been very disappointed with this product. First, they were advertised as Wizard's Wand glow sticks and I received LumiStick Brand. I didn't think there could be ""that much"" difference between brands, so, I didn't question the seller. I used a couple for the first time last night and want to return the lot of them, all 300. These are by far the worst glow stick bracelets I've ever seen. They barely produce any light and I can't comment on their duration because I can barely see them glowing to begin with.Do not waste your money with this product! The Green Group should also update the description to indicate that these are NOT Wizard Wand's, but, a cheap knockoff made by LumiStick."
2,These Are NOT Wizards Wand Glow brand,"BEWARE of MISLEADING Advertising! These are NOT Wizard's Wand Glow brand. Instead they are LUMISTICKS.I don't know when the sellers switched brands, but they should correct their listing."
3,ok...,"Purchased this for an event... they did ""glow"" in the dark! Purchased glow necklaces for Amazon, but with a different seller...the necklaces did not ""glow"" in the dark."
4,Good for the value,"I've been buying this particular brand for the last couple of years. I bought this pack to give out at our annual 4th of July party to all the little ones and to keep track of the guests and teens swimming in the lake after dark. As always anything glow in the dark is a big hit. I had no problems with shipment or issues with glow intensity. This is the first shipment I've ever received, however, where we had leaking issues with a few bracelets. Of course, some of the adults thought it would be great fun to then make splatter glow in the dark t-shirts. Overall, a good value."
3,NOT THE ORIGINAL,"I definitely hav eto recommend against buying these if you are looking for ""original"" Lumistick glow bracelets. These are definitely not as far as I can tell. There is no reference to Lumistick or any other brand anywhere on the packaging and as far as I can tell they are of inferior quality. Many of the sticks are already partially glowing.They are definitely cheap and still work reasonably well but they are not the best glow sticks I've seen."
5,great value,very good priced. This purchase was perfect for teenage party that we puchased it for. I would purchase these again
2,Bracelets are fine but not enough connectors!,"As far as quality goes, the bracelets were as expected. However, they only gave about 150 connectors, which makes it really hard to use the other 150 out of 300 bracelets. I would not buy this product again."
3,Ooooh glowy....,So I was going to a convention and I wanted to have some fun so I got these and covered myself in costume with them and went to the rave tossing them out to people. Was a great time so I have no real complaints about this item.
2,Disappointed - expected a brighter glow,For my son's 9th b-day we planed a nerf party with his friends where they would all wear glowsticks and run-around in the backyard with their favorite nerf guns.Found these and figured they would do the trick with each child having plenty of sticks to wear.Overall Impressions:- None of them glowed very brightly. They all glowed but it was more of a dull glow vs. the vibrant glow I've had with other glowsticks. This is the reason for the low rating.On the plus side:- Plenty of connectors- They arrive all packaged in 1 big box which is good for storing any leftoversNext time I need glow sticks I will look elsewhere.
2,NO CONNECTORS,"Quick shipping, fair price decent glow but NO CONNECTORS!Sorry kids, no bracelet/necklace fun. Kind of a bummer butNot a total wash as they come in a pack of 300. I would buy again"
4,Practial Information,"This book has information that does not go out of date. Very practical advice on how to get along with your adult child's spouse. I purchased it 3x to give as gifts, and also have my own copy."
1,Steeds 'N Schlock,"When a witch (Dee Wallace Stone) tries to sacrifice her blind ward (Allison Balson) to an evil woodland creature who promises eternal youth, a white horse who can turn into a magical dragon comes to the young girl's rescue. Papier-mache sets and bad puppetry make the acting look good. Very young tots might enjoy this, but for most viewers it's a miss.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,Big Oops!!!!,Nicely done AUTOPARTSWAY.COM OR AMAZON. The item listed was listed incorrectly. The picture identifies a Kansas State truck guard while the description identifies a Kansas truck guard. HUGE difference when you're a Kansas State fan...
5,One of the best by Gentle Giant,"I have to admit, I've been listening to this CD constantly for the past few weeks. It's just that awesome. I'm a newbie to the whole prog rock thing, but man, this CD rocks!My favorite tracks:The RunawayExperienceIn a Glass House"
3,"Dry, boring recitation of the facts","A good history should focus on the extraordinary events and the good meaty stories, then surround them with details and everyday events and ordinary happenings. All of Gamble's good stories get buried. By drudging up all the minutiae and every little detail, Gamble may be historically accurate, but he's also boring as hell. It seems like time waiting in the chow line gets as many pages as some of the heroic battles. Also, Gamble keeps harping on Boyington, going back to how his claimed kills don't match the Japanese records, his alcoholism, his insubordination, yadda yadda. Bringing these subjects up once, even twice, is appropriate, but Gamble keeps harping on them. And his theory that Boyington didn't suffer while a POW is ludicrous--that he's less of a hero than some others because he didn't lose as much weight? Please. By grinding his own axe, he loses the reader in the process."
5,AMAZING !,"I'm an avid reader of WW II fighter combat books, and I can hoenstly say: this is the best I've ever read. Fully researched, fast-paced without forgetting informations, great!"
4,The Black Sheep-The Definitive Account,"Much like his book ""Black Sheep One"", Bruce Gamble's book on VMF214 from its original roots before evolving into The Black Sheep, this is a well written and easily read book on the subject of the most productive fighter squadron in the Pacific Theatre during WW2. The level to which Bruce, as a historian of aviation, has gone to depict the complete history of VMF214 is truly amazing.I feel I am now as informed on the matter of U.S. aerial superiority in the South Pacific, on the matter of the superiority of the F4U over the Japanese Zero, on the matter of the dynamics of the members making up the Black Sheep, and finally on the matter of Greg ""Pappy"" Boyington's contribution to improving fighter tactics of the U.S. Marine Corp. I could not go a day without reading a chapter or two of this book until it was finished.Excellent read!"
5,One of the best Pacific War histories,"Here is a study of a Marine Corps fighter squadron that until now has been famous for just one man, Pappy Boyington. But VMF-241 had one life before Boyington became its skipper, and another after he vanished into a Japanese prison camp.Especially welcome are Bruce Gamble's comparisons of U.S. claims with Japanese losses, teasing out the truth of these long-ago encounters. In this, he stands with American naval historian John Lundstrom and British aviation writer Christopher Shores. How amazing that 50 years had to go by before historians thought to look at the records kept by the other side!"
5,New CD is great,"If you like Phunk Junkeez, you will like this CD. I like some of the old stuff better, but it is a great addition to my PJ collection."
1,NOT EXTREME!!,"Don't buy any of the GGW ""extreme"" DVD's! I got roped into buying 1-4 from GGW themselves. I've seen other GGW's that I liked but these are boring. Old footage that they can't sell anymore unless they trick you buy calling it ""extreme"". It's mostly all shot outside, and it is only topless. Do not be fooled by the title like I was! These are anything but ""extreme""!"
2,Topless flashing only...,"While I share most peoples opinions here, because I paid the price and refused to listen to what the others say, but it really only is topless flashing period. Do buy other GGWs but not this one."
1,ON CAMPUS 2,"Well, this is another example of the late GGW videos. Only topless flashing is featured in this DVD. Nothing breaks the monotony of the breasts. Is not worth buying. What happenned to the winning formula of the first GGW DVDs?"
2,A boor,"What a snooze fest. I expected more and got less. Who was working these camera's? I'm expecting the camera to go lower, and for whatever reason, they wouldn't. What a disappointment."
1,Girls Gone to Sleep: Crappiest Disc Ever,"Like the others have said, this disc is simply awful and completely misrepresented. You don't get a whole lot of sexy moments. What you get here are 6 or 7 segments culled from other GGW series videos, I think (not sure because this is the first GGW video I own).The worst part is the tops and bottoms of many scenes are lopped off because of the ""conversion"" to widescreen. The original video source was probably 4:3 and to get to widescreen, they simply cut off tops and bottoms. This is particularly evident in 2 scenes, where all the action takes place outside the frame (I'll leave that to your imagination to figure out).AVOID this piece of low-rent garbage."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I agree with one of the other posts here....""if this is the sexyiest moments"" then i would hate to see the least sexiest! The only redeeming thing is of course that all the women are TOTAL BABES, but the whole thing is lame! Not near what it is advertised to be. Many of the women show nothing at all, and just talk...others flash for a second. There were two scenes that had the potential to be AWESOME but fell way short because of the stupid camerman was focusing on their face while they were ""pleasuring"" themselves instead of having the camera aimed where he should have. I was very tempted to give only one star, but like i said the women here are total babes, and i got it pretty cheap because of it being on sale. You would be better off just watching one of the movies on Cinemax After Dark on a Friday night instead of spending your money on this Blu-Ray disc. I have seen other GGW vid's that were much better than this one."
1,not so uncensored,"Actual nudity in short minutes, low erotic expectation. Not so fun and raundy either. Why they make these kind of videos???"
1,Not worth it,Uncensored but nothing worth censoring. Should be PG-13. But excellent product condition and fast shippment.
2,GGW Sexiest moments ever,For me this was another dud. Just like Girls On Girls And Wildest sex ever it doesn't live up to the title name. It seems they are trying to use hot sounding titles to sell their product instead of hot content. Makes it hard to buy that companys product. Even their previews and reviews lie to you. If they were much more expensive I would hesitate to buy any at all.
3,More than just flashing the top,"I watched this one last night and wasn't real impressed, it had it's moments and they pull their panties or bikini bottoms off but 2 was better, and the dorm room fantasies 2002 was much better. I'm debating on whether to keep it or send it back. Extreme is not the appropriate title for it more like girls getting drunk and showing boobs on the beach."
4,Too Much Flashin' Not Enuff Loooooovin',"Hopster looooooves Girls Gone Wild (pst, do NOT tell Bessie) and this video series on DVD (stills stills stills!!!) is just short of delightful. This particularly entry is not the tip of the peak [...]. What you get with this is a lot of quick (boom boom) flashes and some rather minor girl v. girl shots. It's entertaining, relatively low key, and occasionally revealing (ha, ha!). Reluctantly recommended."
3,"It's alright but not the greatest, HD quality was a little lacking","Alright granted it's a GGW video so yeah nothing too great and all. You'll see some boobs and a couple quick shots below the belt. I kind of thought it was a little bit of a waist seeing as the the ones rubbing one out the camera dude wasn't even on the lips, he was focusing on the damn boobs! I thought it was a waste of the cash spent."
3,Assembly of the Multi-Sport Return Throw,"I am not a rocket scientist, but I can follow directions, especially written ones very well.These directions for putting this together stunk. They were not clear.Step 1 says you need (2) pieces, when you actually need 8 to complete Step 1...serious flaws. I called their customer service. Helpful person, but she,after 25-30 minutes on the phone with me, had to go get one out of the box, and look at it to better assist. It's put together. My son likes it, so that's what counts. I am a dummy for not looking at a retail store first. $10 v. $31 from Amazon."
3,For $40 bucks it served its purpose...,"Don't expect too much. It lasted about 3 months of tough use during baseball season. You get what you pay for. In Spalding's defense, we left it outside the whole time. It might have lasted longer if we brought it in every day."
2,assembly/parts incomplete,"this product looks fairly durable, but all the comments in other posts about extremely poor assembly instructions are true. its awful. and worse -- mine is either defective or missing 2 key pieces. it cannot be assembled (the arm pieces don't connect), leaving me here on friday evening wondering how i'll explain to my kids that we need to wait until customer service opens monday morning. next time maybe i'll visit a store instead. wouldn't it be helpful if spalding customer service paid attention to consumer feedback?"
2,Missing Parts..Unclear instructions,"Assembly instructions are horrible. No total piece count to verify parts in the box. I'm short 3 pieces so this ball return is worthless.I called the 888 number but hours are M - F 10am to 5pm!I can't tell if 1 part is supposed to be crimped or if it's just bent.If I ever do get it together, will it work? Much fustration with this thing!"
4,Not a bad deal,"We were anxious to get this for our seven-year old to use. We priced many others that were similar, but they were very expensive. The only negative was the red strike zone area that ripped about 5 minutes after we put it together because of some wind."
1,Edward Said's opinion,"I will quote the following from Edward Said's Review:""There are some low-level oddities about this book that should be noted quickly. Very few efforts are made to convince readers of what is being said: sources and figures are never cited; abstractions and generalizations pop up everywhere; and, except for three essays on Islam, historical argument is limited to the single proposition that terrorism has never before presented such a threat to ""the democracies.' I was also struck that the verb in the book's subtitle, How the West Can Win, doesn't seem to have an object: Win what? one wonders. So great is the number of contributors, so hortatory the tone, so confident and many the assertions, that in the end you retain little of what has been said, except that you had better get on with the fight against terrorism, whatever Netanyahu says it is.""The review can be found on The Nation"
3,a review from a different perspective,"The 3-star rating is due to the level of enlightenment the book provided. Not so much because anything stated within the countless essays was profoundly insightful, accurate, or objective, but due to the relation the theories have to the current U.S. administration's foreign policy. The 1st 20 pages are the blueprint for the Bush Doctrine.When one reflects on the overly matured influence that neo-conservatives have on current decision-making, combined with the direct neo-convervative link to Israel, the only questions left are, ""Exactly how much priority do Israeli concerns receive in American foreign policy?"" & ""Why?"""
4,Timeless classic,"A good read still to this day, in a very important time when the mafia was beginning to come to light more clearly to the public eye."
5,AWESOME!!,This book really helped me with my 7th grade Social Studies project!! its a WONDERFUL book for the creation myth!! Thanks Hazel!
1,Lack of critical information,"The bread machine kneading paddle does not fit the machine. The problem is that the diameter of the paddle hole is too large and does not engage with the post of the machine. Unfortunately, the information provided by Amazon regarding kneading paddles does not include the diameter of the hole."
1,Don't try to buy,I never got what I ordered. Not the fault of Buy It Now. I tried to contact the company directly and they never got back to me. I wonder if they are even still in business...
3,Captivating--Truly a Page-Turner,"The Nightrider Chronicles is a captivating collection of anecdotes from the mid-1800s regarding outlaws and bandits from North Central Louisiana. Heavily footnoted in places, this compilation of research contains story after story of situations, mayhem, and close calls of those migrating from the Southeast U.S. toward Texas. Mr. Peebles has created an extraordinary and detailed chronicle for anyone interested in the history of lawlessness in the harsh times of the South, much of which is attributed to the Civil War."
5,Best. Ever.,I love this album-- it is astounding. I think the draw of it is the sonic atmosphere created by Glifted. I really can't get enough of it and it's now one of my favorite albums. Highly recommended. It reminded me of the best shoegaze.
1,Inexcusable,"What in the hell happened to Tim Lash? This album is more than inexcusable, it's unforgiveable. Repetetive torture that could be used as a primer for suspected terrorists to inflict numbing pain prior to them being waterboarded. This isn't even remotely Hum. It's dysfunctional gibberish. I really would like my money back but I bought this album used, unfortunately. One of the WORST albums I've ever wasted my time and money on. For shame, Hum fans, don't even touch this. Good god, it's gobbligook. A tangled mess of repetitive stupidity."
3,not really sure,I bought this product not really understanding that it was mainly about how to prevent the spread of sickness in secondary schools.
3,Not very helpful,"This book seems to be just a bunch of pictures of different screens from Illustrator without any explanations. I have gleaned a few useful tips, but I think a book with some step-by-step guides for a few creative projects would be much more helpful than this book."
5,"$9.81 and it comes with a bead chain and a metal dogtag inscribed with ""Circulon""","I am no longer reluctant to use my Lodge cast iron fryer now that I have this brush as its designated scrubber. It is cheaper than the Rosle version and the bristles are black. Everytime I scrubbed the fryer after cooking, I would ruin the scrubbie as the dark grease somehow soaked the nylon and wouldn't come out. I used the brush right away and used it several times in one day. Now I like the Lodge fryer so much better because I have this brush. I actually made sauce from the detritus of a pork chop because the surface of the fryer was trustworthy for once. I put this in the dishwasher every night."
3,Cool boots,"I love these boots and still get positive comments on them. Regarding make, it is definitely of shoddier construction and has very little sole padding to speak of. I only wear them sparingly now since they're starting to wear out but I still love the graphic colors and pattern."
5,One of the world's great religious texts,"This classic, originally a collection of folk narratives, is the myth and history of one of Tibet's legendary reclusive saints. The translation has a fluid and musical quality, and is easily accessible to the contemporary reader. There is much material here to fuel contemplation, particularly the stories concerning the courage to face inner fears and temptations. Meditators and followers of all spiritual paths will find the book most useful, but it is engrossing enough as a folk tale to keep anyone's attention. It is my personal favorite among the world's bibles, and I am delighted to see it reissued."
3,Sequels always have a hard time,"... when they follow a truly great first book of a series. In this case, I for one might have rated Never Surrender higher, had it not been the sequel to such a wonderful book as Winston's War. Compared to its predecessor Never Surrender seems average in spite of being well written, probably because the cast of characters surrounding Churchill seems lacklustre compared to the witty and merciless portraits of for instance Guy Burgess, Brendan Bracken and Neville Chamberlain in Winston's War.On a general level, Never Surrender deserves praise for managing to keep the reader in suspense until the very end in spite of dealing with historical events with a well known outcome. I understand there is to be another sequel, which will hopefully deal less with Churchill's emotional state and more with the political machinations of Whitehall during the war."
4,It's enjoyable.,"All Bouncing Souls fans should have this dvd in their collection. It's a really well done documentary that starts from the birth of the Bouncing Souls and leaves off at their ""How I spent my Summer Vacation"" album. They led a rather exciting life and have more then a few handful of stories to share."
2,Not Really a Highlander Book,"I was in need of a Highlander, Time Travel, Romance fix so based on peeps' reviews I went with this author. The book, although ok, is far from a Karen Moning type tale. This is the 1st of a series which imply that there are lots of Highlander stuff in between the covers, wrong. Weak on story line and certainly sex, it's far from captivating. Buy it used if you must at all."
3,Nice Tale,"The first three books of the Chapman Highlander series has been sitting on my bookshelf waiting to be read for two years. I finally cracked open the first and enjoyed what I found. Well developed characters and an interestingly told story make this tale a treat. I truly liked Grey and Grace, but more so individually than as a pair. I felt the romance was truer in the beginning than as the story progressed and I was expecting something steamier with the love scenes. Truth be told, it's hard to compete with Karen Marie Moning when it comes to time traveling Highlanders."
2,Charming the Highlander,"I liked the idea of the book: highlander, time travel, romance and snow (yes, I love snow) but unfortunately I found this story a bit of a miss. It starts off really sad with a death of a loved one and some really emotional scenes; if that is your sort of thing I think you will love this, but I read to escape the stress of real life. I found that it set the tone for the rest of the book. The story chugged along without engaging me and I was pleased to finally get to the end.The part of the story that I think would have been interesting, the highlander finding himself in the future after time traveling and having to get used to a new way of living, wasn't described at all, which I found disappointing."
4,I liked it,"This is the first story I've read of Janet Chapman and I have to say that I quite enjoyed it. Having read Kurland, Garwood, Deveraux, I love reading about time travel romance books and the medieval period. Charming the Highlander offers both and more in the sense of supernatural occurrences. I can't wait to read the others books."
5,I love Chapman,"I really liked this series and this book was the main reason. Chapman did a good job of creating the chemistry between the characters and I found myself welling up more than once when the storyline hit an emotional high. I had never purchased any books by Chapman before so I wasn't sure what I was getting into, but I'm glad I took the chance. As the series progresses, the tension/chemistry between the characters seems to weaken, but since it's something I tend to look for in a good romance book, this may not bother other readers as much.I would recommend this book in particular, but the series in general for anyone looking to fall in love with a group of alpha males and strong and intelligent women."
4,"Laughing, Crying and Baby in a plaid","This was a very ""sweet"" read. You already know the plot by now, so I won't repeat it. The characters were well developed and the story was fast paced. Personally I'd like a little more descriptive ""sheet dancing"", but it would not have worked here. The interaction between the characters was witty and real. Best part of the story for me was thinking about a scared highlander fashioning a diaper out of a towel for 4 week old ""Baby"" and winds up making an over the shoulder plaid for him. I'd like to see that sold in a store. Worth your time and money."
5,Incredible debut novel!,"Comparible to other popular, best-selling paranormal/time travel romance authors, Janet Chapman is an exciting new voice in romance genre fiction!From first page to last, CHARMING THE HIGHLANDER is a delight. As someone else mentioned, this book has it all - exceptional characterization and storyline, emotional depth and just downright GOOD writing - debut author, Janet Chapman is already a master at her craft.I can't wait to read the other books in this series!"
4,Pretty Good,Just sampled their tracks and they sound pretty good. I will buy the album now. Thanks Amazon for selling non-DRM MP3s!
4,Christian music,"I bought this for either my niece or nephew as a gift. I know that they enjoy it and listen to it on occasion, but not quite their favorite."
3,"Decent, but not great.","I was actually dissapointed because these guys were so highly rated. They lack maturity in their sound. They are decent, but just not as catchy as some of the other stuff that is out."
5,Right on the mark!,"When the Rush of Fools album was given to me by a friend of mine, I fell in love with it right away! As some other reviewers have mentioned, musically there is so much to enjoy and appreciate. I have listened to this cd many times and it remains fresh with each play. I also find that the lyrics strike me in different ways as I listen to it more and more. I keep finding new thoughts to ponder as the words hit my heart and I come away encouraged and refreshed because I can identify with what they are talking about. There is a lot of wisdom here for such a young band. I, too look forward to their next release!"
5,Solid Faith (Rush of Fools),"The Artists chose inspired lyrics of faith and always lift up Jesus. The melodies are not too slow, just right to be encouraging, and likable by most young and older people. Some of the songs are in a form of prayer and will touch the heart of the listeners."
5,Ryan Rules,"I have been reading Will Ryan's work for a number of years. His bass book is entertaining and helpful, precisely the kind of writing which I have come to expect from this author. I am a fly fisher, not a bait and bullets guy, and for me learning the techniques described in the book where very helpful. However, I also appreciate Ryan's non-pretentious attitude regarding certain fishing technique inclinations.I also appreciate the anecdotes which are sprinked throughout the book. If one wants a stict how-to book go read your chain saw manuel. I prefer a bit of whimsy thrown in.In short this is a must-have in your library if you consider yourself a serious fisherman and wish to add bass on the fly to your routine."
5,Easy to read and very educational,Mr. Ryan's remarkable knowledge of smallmouth bass and how to catch them on a fly set the stage for this quick read. I enjoyed his down to earth writing style and instructional prose.
4,INTERESTING!,"WHILE THERE ARE COLOUR PLATES IN THE BOOK, ITWOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF THE FLIES WERE PICTUREDNEXT TO THEIR DISCRIPTIONS. ALSO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO SEE AT LEAST DISCRIPTIONS OF THE HOOKS AND THEIR SIZES AS NOT ALL OF US ARE ADVANCED OR MASTER TYERS."
1,The worst book on the subject ever,"Ok, so I have read all of the reviews, and they sold me on the book. The deal is, if you are looking for a book on ""Strategy with a fly rod"" look someplace else. The author spends too much time strolling down amnesia lane talking about bait casting as a child. Like we care??? I bought this book because I wanted a book to define some of the more intricate points about smallmouth fishing in streams and lakes....using my fly rod. To bad that this guy spends the majority of his time dealing with deep-water presentations and live bait. I do not know how you flyfish, but I have never tied on a live crayfish in my life. The book is a... and is misnamed. A true waste of money and time to any flyfisherman. You can learn more out on the water casting blind into a mud puddle!"
5,The Realest,"Excellent!!!!I highly recommend this documentary, it's a must have for every Pac/hip-hop fan."
5,very interesting,no matter where you sit on the fence with Tupac Shakur you can't ignore His Importance as a Artist.this Video reveals alot of interesting aspects of Him through His BodyGuard&also some Studio footage.very detailed&On Point Presentation here.you won't forget it after you see it.
5,Great video - but is it the truth????,"This was absolutely the BEST video I've seen on Tupac, or any rap artist! After suffering through Thug Immortal, it looks as if Xenon finally has gotten it right. The only thing I question is whether the bodyguard is telling all that he knows. Some of the stuff seems believable, but there was a lot of stuff that just didn't make sense to me.But from a pure entertainment perspective, it was very good. I laughed (the in-studio footage was hilarious - it was good to see Pac smiling), and I got caught up in the moment when he died. The film was very intelligently done. I've always been a Tupac fan, and this is finally something really about HIM! Of course now though, I want some more Pac material!"
5,For The Serious Pac Fan,"If you really have an interest in Tupac Shakur, and you REALLY want to know who is possibly responsible for his murder, then get Tupac Shakur: Before I Wake. Out of all the Tupac documentaries, this is the only one that followed his shooting in a step by step format. Frank's part is a little long, but he takes you on a step by step journey of Pac's last year of his life. It was good seeing Easy E in the doc, some people act like he never existed. Done by true Pac fans and fans of hip hop.....I can tell, can you??"
2,This should have been called the Frank Alexander story,This DVD was worth the [money] I spent but I would not recommend it to any non Tupac Fan. This DVD is basically Tupac's body guard telling about his life as Tupac's main body guard and friend. This DVD does an exellent job of showing the softer side of Tupac. The in studio footage is very entertaining. Out of the 8 0r 9 people interviewed only Frank Alexander had a close relationship with Pac. Not a single represenitive of Death Row was interviewed. No interview was done with his mother or close homeboys who new Pac for many years. Frank Alexander is an impostor who is using his position as Pac's ex body guard to make a quick buck. Frank Alexander is the executive producer and he made no effort to make this a fair balanced piece. Alexander new Pac for all of 12 months. More interjection from people who new Pac on a personal basis would have made this DVD worth purchasing. All that said it is still a must have for a true Tupac fan.
5,A Must Watch!,"I must say when it comes to Tupac, I'll watch anything, but their have been some disappointing videos, like for example Thug Immotral, which just was .... That video they are just trying to make money out of his name. This one I had my doubts but as I continued to watch, it got more exciting. I really do recommend this DVD for all 2pac fans. It just makes you think, how talented he was, also the way he died. In my opinion his murder was defintely a setup, it was planned. That's the sad thing about Tupac, a great artist, dying at a young age, when he had so much to prove and accomplish. But to my point every Pac fan must see this. I know I did, I even shed some tears at the end of the video. It can be a very emotional video also, but very interesting and exciting. R.I.P Tupac Amaru Shakur, the legend he is, the best."
4,Trade's Paulina Gaitan Shines!,"Paulina Gaitan (""Trade"" & ""Innocent Voices"") shines in this well made Family Friendly Drama about a young man who leaves the comforts & disruptions of family life for the mean streets of Mexico City where the luminous Cielo (Paulina Gaitan) helps him out despite her thug Brother Gato's almost corruption of the poor young man.Must See!Cielo"
2,over priced,just got this watch the other day and its already broken. it stopped moving and it will not wind anymore and when you shake it a little things rattle inside of it. there also seems to be no way to have it repaired because there is no way for anyone to get inside the watch to even look at it. dont waste your time with this brand because when i went to the website this watch was not even listed under its products as well. over priced for the quality of the watch.
3,Hit or miss,"eh...picked this up to check out after stumbling upon another wonderful KK tribute called ""Nothing Left to Lose,"" which I love. This one has its moments, but overall doesn't hold a candle to the other, in my book. Pretty hit or miss, doesn't hold together as great, and largely pretty straight-ahead. I already knew the songs, so didn't really need to hear so many straight covers, and most of the more experimental stuff is mixed in terms of success. Might be good for an old-school kk fan, but my money's on the other moodier tribute. But then maybe I'm just being moody."
4,Yes I gave it 4 stars without hesitation,"Okay folks, two things: 1. ""Dancing at the Blue Iguana"" is not another ""Showgirls"", so don't expect to find another Elisabeth Berkeley in there. 2. Amid thousands of cliche-filled Hollywood movies, you will get to appreciate this unconventional filmmaking approach using improvisational workshops done by the actors themselves (as seen in the DVD's documentary). Now about the ""girls"": Okay, Daryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly & Sheila Kelley might not have reflected the images of young dancing babes in L.A. today, but they all performed their roles quite well. Sandra Oh also did a standout job in portraying the double life of Jasmine/Cathy. And Charlotte Ayanna's voice was no less beautiful than her appearance. (Recalling the fact that she spent 12 years of her childhood in foster homes and won Miss Teen USA in 1993 wearing a $37 evening gown only made me love her even more)."
4,Both Gritty and Delicate,"It's easy to dismiss the residents of the seedier addresses of our culture. But the ""Blue Iguana"" makes us look behind the pasties, not to just the flesh, but to the real stories of these women. Whether caustic and hard, crippled and soft, or just plain exhausted, Blue Iguana skillfully pulls us into places we might not otherwise go, and shows us how much we DON'T see. Most notable are Jennifer Tilly, (who is in my opinion the 21st century's Marilyn Monroe), and Sandra Oh. Oh delivers a breathtaking and heartbreaking performance as Jasmine, an intelligent and talented poet who dances because the money's better than waitressing. While it's definitely easier to believe the somewhat stereotypical Darryl Hannah character(Angel, the deadly gorgeous but warm-hearted dingbat), Jasmine embodies the range of possibilities for each of the characters, and for all of us. Without apology or fear, this is a terrific portrait of woman's resiliency, courage and spirit."
1,Horrid and pointless !,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen ! Here are just a few of my criticisms:3 of the actresses (Hannah, Oh, and Kelley) are way too old to be strippers. Yes they look great for their ages, but they wouldn't cut it in a strip club with younger competition.Strippers aren't all a mess, and yet the ones at this club are. Very unrealistic.No men would go to a strip club where the women kept their bottoms on.There is no point to this movie other than to apparently moralize that stripping is a depressing road to nowhere. But the reality is that many strippers are pretty much normal women with normal lives, they can just make a heck of a lot more money stripping than doing anything else.AVOID !"
4,enjoyable movie,"It is a good movie, although it did not live up to the ratings. I found it be okay, passable."
4,Dancing at the Blue Iguana,"I bought the movie just to hear Eric Clapton's ""River of Tears"" and ended up enjoying the heartbreaking story as well."
4,Dancing at the Blue Iguana,"If you haven't seen this movie and experienced the music you are missing out. Raw, true emotion flows from each character while at the same time your caressed with the phenomenial music selection chosen for this movie.I'd really enjoy the full soundtrack or list of music and artists used to create the waves of emotion I felt through this entire movie."
4,Don't forget to view the documentary,"OK, The movie was good but the documentary with the DVD was better. DH placed alot of effort into her character and produced a documentary that gives real insite into the dancers. I had a friend that danced and never really understood the experience, this movie and the documentary opened my eyes.Thanks DH for taking the time and effort to produce an informative and entertaining piece of work"
4,Great for mini-cupcakes!,I use these for my birthday parties at Tot Spot Cafe. The cupcakes are not super secure so it is easier to place the display and then load in the cupcakes.
4,adorable,"Big hit at parties. everybody just loves tiny baked goods on display.Very easy to put together and clean. Not incredibly sturdy, but does its job well. You don't really need a hardcore heavy duty mini-cupcake stand."
2,Not the standard cupcake size,"I got this with the mini-cupcake baking tin and so they go together. However, after using them together a few times, I wish I got the regular cupcake size. The small size cupcake is hard to frost as it tends to topple over. The stand itself (since this review is technically about the stand) works and is pretty to display, but you can probably get the bigger size stand for the bigger sized muffin. If I were to do it over again, I would just get those glass multilayered cake stands that are more versatile."
3,Bad cupcake balance,"This mini cupcake stand is beautiful, easy to assemble but the cupcake balance is pretty bad. Is a pain to keep them on the tower.I think is the design, which is not perfect. Anyways, it makes its job."
4,Lightweight and compact,The item came quickly and without damage. The mini stand holds the cupcakes nicely for display and makes it easy for people to take a single cupcake.
3,They ok for a little kids party,I had got them for me however they were way to small but i can use them for a little kids party so thats good
1,Leaning Tree Not for Me,"I was very dissatisfied with this product. When I put it together as directed it would not sit flat. I had to bend the different ""branches"" on each tier so that the cupcakes could sit flat. I was never able to get the bottom tier to sit flat so I ended up throwing it away in frustration and purchasing another tree to display cupcakes at my daughter-in-law's bridal shower."
4,pretty cupcake display,"This display is made for mini-cupcakes, standard size cupcakes topple right over on the stand. Ordered 2 because they were described as small, two looked nice great on both sides of the cake. The product requires some assembly, not too difficult. It looked really nice when assembled, some cupcakes were a little tilted, but they all survived and added a little something extra to the sweets table. Will reuse for future gatherings, but I do wish it was a little taller."
2,Not all parts came in order,"The hitch itself is fine and instructions to mount seem straightforward.However, they should not claim that it comes with a drawbar, nor show one in the product photo if it does not come with one. Based on other people's experiences with not getting one, I will just go to a local auto parts store to get one. Frustrating!!!"
2,Enough already!!,"In my opinion Ms. Mayes is doing for the literary world what Thomas Kincaid has done for art.I was absolutely entranced with Italy after reading UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN.........and equally so with BELLA TUSCANY. I must admit that while I truly enjoyed the photographs contained in IN TUSCANY I was less than satisfied with the written content. I feel that the passion Ms. Mayes felt with her first book, and so openly shared with the readers, has wained with each successive book and she is nothing but commerical at this point.I feel she has allowed celebrity and money to corrupt her art ..... much the same as Mr. Kincaid. So, when will we see the Bramasole tea towels or the Cortona coasters???"
5,Beautiful Photos - Great Recipes,"Beautiful photos of Bramasole, local people, food & furniture. Great workable recipes, ideas on exactly where to shop, instructions of how to ship treasues to North America, gardens to explore in the Tuscan area, plus other Mayes adventures. Lyrical writing style will make you want to book a trip immediately!"
5,Tremendous remaster job,"I of course realy like both of these albums, I had both of them on vinyl back in the 70's.I also think ""Alone Together"" is Dave's finest hour. But ""It's Like You Never Left"" is a great album in it's own right. And ""Dave Mason"" is a very good one. The version of All Along The Watchtower rivals the one by Hendrix. Remember, Dave Mason played on the original Jimi Hendix version of the Dylan classic.But the unbelievable added bonus here is that Steve Hoffman did the remaster work. Hoffman is the best that there is at remastering albums, hands down the best.So sonicly this remaster is outstanding.If you like Dave Mason, grab this before it's gone. These 2 for 1 cd's are very rarely reprinted."
2,More Orange then Cloves.,"I got the tester with high anticipation that it would smell like the Black Clove Ciggerets I am partial too, but was bitterly disappointed. The scent is VERY sweet and fruity, the clove smell gets overpowered by the citrus. If you are into that, more power to you."
3,Best of Emperor,"This two disk set is exacty what the it says, a collection of the best songs of emperor. Unfortunatly due to the fact Emperor varies there sound so much throught the span of there career, it leaves the listener much to be desired. When going through the first disk the I found it to be very disjointed, and it felt as though I was listening to a completely different band by the end of the disk. It does display a good sampling of emperor's career, and is worth it for new listeners of the group. The second disk cover songs. I would only rcomend for the absoulte die hard fans of the group who feel they must here absolutly everything they have done. I always felt the strongest aspect of the group was the composition, and these cover songs do not show that aspect. Overall I'd recommend this compalation for new listers to sample the genius that is Emperor"
3,Effective wall of sound energy.,"For value this is great, a double album packed full. Quality varies but there is no denying a lot of energy and strength in the tracks. Blows Cradle Of Filth into the abyss as a real ripp-off band. Like all this music the lyrics end up a distraction and would be better off removed. Give it a go. A good intro to the band and Black Metal as a genre."
1,can not believe it is pure; it was blue in color,I've used argan oil in the past. This product had blue tint to it. It was significant enough to stain a piece of white tissue. I find it very hard to believe it is pure and organic. I suspect it was treated in some way. I returned it.
5,argan oil,"This is nice. It has a strange smell but the smell doesn't linger. Makes your skin feel great. It's kind of hard to get out of the bottle without shaking it vigorously, but it isn't any drawback since the product is well worth it. It is a great emollient for skin without harmful and irritating chemicals. All natural is the way to go if you really want your skin to heal and be refined. You can also use it on your nails and hair."
3,argon oil is good for many things,"I purchased the argon oil after my hairdresser used something called ""moroccan oil"" on my hair. He told me it was also good for the skin and the major ingredient was argon oil. I put a little on my hand which had a burn and the next day it was almost healed. I decided to try the pure argon oil and see if I preferred it to the ""moroccan oil"". Unfortunately, the pure oil although good is not as good as the ""moroccan oil"". I will definitely finish the bottle but would probably only buy the ""moroccan oil"" again."
4,Argan Oil - Excellent,The product was recommended by a friend from work and it turned out it helped me a lot with regards to my use on my skin. I have been experimenting with a lot of other oilments but nothing worked. This turned out to be a successfull experimentation and has been helping me tremendously.
3,so far so good!,"I was told by an Algerian friend of mine that Argan oil is great for the skin and hair so I looked into it and purchased this product. so far it's been a good experience, however she's a little skeptical, since it has no scent and usually argan oil smells like burnt peanuts. we'll see in a few months if it really makes a difference."
2,organic argan oil,I have been using this product for over 2 weeks. I do not see any change in my skin as far as less wrinkled or more moisture.I have not tried it on my hair.
2,So-so,I dont think this product lives up to all the hype. Does nothing for my cuticles or frizzy gray hairs.
5,Silky Argan Oil Love It!!,"I really love this product! It is soo silky soft on my skin. I have had heart surgery and I have been putting it on my scar on my chest and it is already lightening it some! It makes my skin smooth and my hair was so shiny after i put some on it after I showered. I think it is really worth the price!!! I will be buying more. Thankyou Amazon, and AAA Shea Butter Company!! Great product!!!! Had to go back and change my star from 2, to 5! It was a mistake, sorry about that!! Lol"
1,Beware AAA Shea Butter Company!,The bottle of argan oil I received was spoiled. I emailed the company for a return or exchange but never received a reply. I recommend not buying from AAA Shea Butter Company!Would give zero stars if I could!
3,"Good oil, but not for my skin","I used this oil and it did a good job moisturizing my dry, damaged hair. However, this oil made me break out. I used it on my face very sparingly twice and both times I broke out. Not for my skin. I'll continue to use it for my hair. The smell is unpleasant as well, but disappears after a while."
2,The Buddha,"This is the first time in the years that I've been buying from Amazon Marketplace that the product condition was worse than what I expected. It has spots all over it, obviously has to be a liquid and that was not mentioned. Inacurate description. Disappointing."
3,Good series - bad case design.,This comment is for the box set. The series is great but the case design is crappy. All the dvd's are lose in the set. Every time you open a season the dvd's fall out. Mine wasn't scratched but I can see how that can happen.
3,Some disks damaged,"When I received my set the first thing I checked was whether or not any disks popped out of their holders as what other reviewers mentioned. I was happy to discover every disk was in its place. Unfortunately, while watching the second disk of the first season, I discovered the the disk is faulty. Looking at the bottom of the disk, there are absolutely no visible scratches at all but no matter which DVD player I try it on, the last part of Episode 4 on that disk just couldn't be read. I found a DVD scanning software (Nero Diskspeed) and found out that disks 2 3 4 5 were all faulty. Only disks 1 and 6 came out the test without issues.So yeah, unfortunately there must have been a problem in the manufacturing of these disks. I guess I may have to get the individual seasons as opposed to this convenient set."
4,Wonderful Series in a beautiful package,"This series is wonderful. I was instantly drawn in by the love-ably flawed characters. The box is sturdy and the packaging is beautifully designed. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is-- I agree with the other viewers, the DVDs don't stay snaped in their spot very well. It arrived (through no fault of amazon) with some discs out of place but nothing was scratched."
4,Queer As Folk Box Set,"I like the compact nature of this box set especially since everything I ever wanted to know about the program is bound to be on one of the several discs included. The only reason this product did not recieve 5 stars was because as usual for many box set items, the outer box packaging and some inner components aren't as durable as I would like. The high gloss paper thats affixed to the exterior will definately crack and peel in a few years...but oh well; beauty over use?"
2,Queer as Folk Complete Series,"Queer as Folk Complete SeriesDiscs wont load without 5 attempts or more. Some wont load at all, just as previous reviews stated.I think you should send me a brand new set and make sure they all load before sending.I trust Amazon and am very disappointed."
5,My favorite series on DVD ever!,You cannot get a better depiction of the gay lifestyle than with this one. It is very real and you really grow to love and care for the characters!
5,Queer as Folk,"One of the finest series every produced for television. Showtime should be commended for their courage to produce such a ground break series. Well acted, completely believable and an excellent portrait of gays as individuals. Wish the series had gone on longer!"
5,If you open your mind you'll love it.,"If you open your mind and get past the first couple of episodes, you will love this show. Don't try to compare it to real life because most of you will be disappointed. If real life was as cool as T.V. ... Why would we need T.V.? The first couple of episodes turned me off, but I came to realize there was a true love story buried in the chaos. I love all the characters for their differences as well as their bonds of loyalty to each other. Give it a try but don't stop after the first few episodes! It gets so much better."
2,Queer as Folk Complete Series,"There were bumps on the outside of the disc circle insert which caused numerous delays in the d.v.d.s, I had to grind them down myself. I think when they put the labels on the discs, a machine caused the underneath plastic to disform."
5,Great All Around Series,"This is a great all around show, from drama to comedy. You will want to watch the next episode. It is addicting."
3,Um..,"why was it that everybody thought that Brian was some kind of advertising genius? ALL of his ideas centered around the theory (which everybody in the free world knows) that sex sells. DUH. every storyline in which he had to come up with some amazing campaign, turns out he creates a presentation with semi naked men or something of the like. Got a bad tasting alcohol beverage? Just put hot men in the advertisements! And then everybody praises him and asks how he thought of it. stupid."
3,It's what you need.,If you are a die hard fan of the show (as I am) this is the right purchase for you. It combines all five seasons of the show together for one relatively low price. The only complaint that I would have is that the packaging for the DVDS is not the best quality. When my order arrived all of the DVDS had fallen out of the places in the holder. They still continue to do this today. However the deal (and the need to see this show frequently) far out way the inconvience.
3,QAF Disc Rate,"I loved the series. The show is great. Acting, writing fantastic! However, the quality of the disc, not the best. 7 of the 24 discs are unreadable. I would like to know how I can get them replaced."
1,Damaged Shipment,"Dear Amazon,Please resend this shipment as the box was damaged and open when I got it.Not all the contents were in the box and I would like for you to reship the item.Thanks,Robert Newton"
3,"Brilliant trombonist, too monotonous","Heard one track on npr radio, ordered CD. While the playing is awesome, I would have preferred an orchestral accompaniement. The CD overall is too monotonous to listen to more than one or two tracks at a time. Like the concept of ""sunsets"". J F"
2,"Musically fine, but disappointing visually","Allegedly directed for television, this production is disappointing because of its terrible lighting and production values. To make it interesting and appealing to watch would require more than the pale blue lighting that pervades throughout. Even if there were some colour in the costumes, sets or faces, it wouldn't show up because of the poor lighting. The staging is overly stylized as well, setting a new low standard. The same forces issued a production of Alceste which was somewhat better.Musically and aurally the performance is very good indeed. The cast is great. But I wanted something that was also satisfying to watch. I already have a terrific CD of this opera.It might have looked fine on stage, but as a DVD on my widescreen HD set it is a big mistake. I will not purchase another opera on DVD from these producers unless they pay more attention to the visual qualities."
1,Waste of Good Music,"What a waste of beautiful music by Gluck. What's all that stilted and hand gestures all about? If I wanted to see a Chinese Peking Opera, I would have gone to one. This is a French Opera, no amount of ""modern"" production can make it ""better"". Save your money and get the Australian Opera production with the same title. It's modern and beautifully sung and staged."
1,Who was Gluck?,"Christoph Willibald Gluck apparently wanted to simplify operatic music so that the florid lines of a Handel or other Italian Opera composers were rejected in favor of simple vocal lines. To my ear he succeeded all too well. I am an enthusiast who favors almost everything John Eliot Gardiner conducts but I could find almost nothing to listen to here. THIS MUSIC IS DULL. No amount of orchestral polish and vocal polish (of which there is a great deal) can cover the dullness of the ""music"" The staging is outlandishly static with only the minor character Amour having anything like motion allowed. Unbelievably static. The blue color lighting will also drive most viewers crazy. I could only recommend this video to a Gluck fanatic and I suggest that if you don't know who Gluck is, you shouldn't waste your money on this disk."
4,Mandala Affirmations Calendar 2006,"Last year a friend gave me the 2005 Mandala calendar of interesting proverbs, prayers, and general folk wisdom. I found I enjoyed the colorful pages and sayings, developed favorite mandalas, and especially liked the useful graph paper on the reverse side of each tear-off page. I use it for notes, lists, and even to construct my own mandala doodles. You can color the mandal on the weekend page, although I rarely do.This year's 2006 mandala calendar consists of daily affirmations that are not too corny and includes a welcome addition of sand painting mandalas. And I always appreciate the handy graph paper on the reverse."
5,Junkyard thriller!,"Forget the negative reviews. This film isn't for arthouse buffs, but people who like a good thrill ride. The main charactors are very likable, the acting is good and the action is plenty. Highly recommended!"
5,Best Christmas gift for Grandparent!,"We bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandmother who lives in a nursing home. She loves it! With space so limited, the ability to hold an endless slideshow of pictures in a small space is a huge bonus. It was easy to load even for my techically challenged mother, and now they are downloading pictures from extended family from Atlanta to Tampa to Texas. My Grandmother can see the screen clearly and hold it in her lap, and the ability to view a slideshow without turning the pages of an album is a plus for her limited mobility. This gift worked exactly as described, expected, with no difficulties, and filled a need like nothing else. I can think of a hundred people I would give this to when the price comes down, including myself!"
1,Many problems!,"Received the 'first' unit which was missing cables and had a non-functional remote. Played MP3's, mov, and displayed pictures fine. Would have been happy enough if all the parts were present and working. Returned this unit and received a second which didn't work, didn't even have a remote or speakers (561 in a 562 box?). Time for another replacement - which came without remote, with speakers, but faulty software or micro? Menu's one deep were blank rectangles which didn't function and MP3's which played on the first unit locked up this unit - same for mov files. Actually tried a forth time because the first unit seemed to be OK functionally, but last unit was exactly the same as previous with blank menu's and faulty functionality. E-mailed Digital Spectrum and have not received a reply, which actually led me to write this feedback! Hard to believe this company will survive if they don't straighten up their act."
1,Save your Money,"Digital Spectrum U-30343 NuVue 7"" Plus Digital Picture FrameSpend a few dollars more and get an infinitely better product. This product fails on almost every level, first and foremost its primary function displaying nice looking images. Images look terrible, that's if you can even see them. It is difficult to copy images to, images are squished, the look terrible and the screen is anything but bright. Since buying this unit I have seen several others that friends own and I can't tell you how much better the others are."
2,"Lots of features, low quality. Don't rush to order this.","Not only did I run into the same problems that many other did: cryptic manual, poorly fitting stand, and only able to view a limited number of the pictures stored on the memory card, I also experienced frequent picture black-outs or severe fading. By literally tweaking either power plug where it plugged into the frame or the power switch I could get the picture restored, most of the time. When it worked, it was nice enough having a variety of pictures at my desk. But it was also sort of a relief not having to hassle with it to get it work once it died completely."
1,"I bought the NuVue sight-unseen, bad idea.","The instructions were useless - still having problems understanding how it works. Poorly designed; limited features, poor resolution. Save your money, don't buy this product"
2,Problematic,"I received this as a gift and at first I thought it was great, but then I realized it would only display 142 images. I worked with technical support for several months (they are not the speediest or most helpful). I resized, renamed, restructured the photos, tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug. I RMA'd the unit at my shipping expense of course, only to recieve another with the same problem. I wouldn't recommend this purchase."
3,BE CAREFUL!!,Bought one of these for my wife at Christmas...Oh..and by the way..thanks Wal*Mart for allowing me to say Merry Christmas again!....Well....Just be careful about the plastic counter stand that snaps on the back...it is poorly designed and mine literally snapped off when I tried to finagle it into the hole.
2,Digital Photo Frame,It arrived broken with the stand missing. I have been waiting to replace it at a local Discovery store.
3,"Informative, but dull","I read this book for a graduate school class on sociolinguistics. I do not have a background on linguistics, so reading this with little knowledge and experience was challenging. There is a heavy emphasis on particular location's linguistics, and Romaine's writing on gender was very interesting. It contains a lot of information, but it will be quite an experience for a reader who is new to linguistics."
2,Only 2 good songs,"This CD has a variety of styles and different front men per song. I purchased the CD for Company Gato which is by far the best song on the disc. I was hoping for more tracks like it but ultimately was disappointed with boring beats and questionable vocals by other lead singers. Buy the mp3 version of Company Gato, and move on."
5,best Rotisserie on the market,"i bought the Wal Mart knock off Rotisserie,i liked it until i wanted a bigger one. Ronco have a great Rotisserie,that does an excellent job. i just set it and forget it!"
5,A good guide to what debate's really about,"Fine is a sociologist, and so you find out a lot here about the culture of debate. I found this right on target as both an old regional policy debater (similar to the Minnesota teams profiled in the book) and the parent of a national circuit policy debater (similar to the teams Fine's son participated in). Fine does a great job explaining the differences between these and the tension between them.There's NO debate theory or how-to in this book -- but then those books don't really contain a consideration of the culture of debate, either."
5,The Most Wonderful book of Fairires I have ever found.,"Now I'm an adult who ran across the book just a little while ago. I have always loved fairies, but was not really into the horrid interpretations of modern day artiest. This book is so amazing it's unreal! The artwork is so beautiful and delicate. She painted them as beautiful wide-eyed children and adolescents, with absolutely amazing accuracy on the accompanying flowers. The poems for each flower fairy describes the chararistics of the flower with such grace it sends chills up my spine. A WONDERFUL book for parents to read to their children, as well as a great book for adults who want to stay children at heart. I can not express enough the beauty and gentleness of her artwork enough! The book here contains all 8 of the Flower Fairies books as well as story of The Fairy Necklaces and the poems she illustrated for Old Rimes for All Times. You will not be disapointed."
5,great price,"value for money complete collection of mary barker, exccellent book for kids - lovely images, vibrant colours, poetic scenes, elegant english, handy size. esp for kids who are interested in literature."
5,Great!,My daughters love this book. Lovely drawing and poems all throughout. Thanks so much. Highly recommended! You won't be disappointed. Buy it now
5,The Best Flower Fairies!,"You have to love Cicely! It's not optional, she is the purest in the sense of her art work and poetry. Simplicity at it's finest and genuine to the highest. She makes you almost believe in the world of fairies living among your own flowers. The book is put together in seasonal sequence with little notations ocassionally about different names of the featured flowers. The poetry is simple, easy to understand and is a wonderful way to introduce young children to an entire world of fairies outside of Disney."
5,A valuable reference,"As a practicing scientist, I always keep this excellent book close at hand in the laboratory. The taxonomy, husbandry, breeding and nutritional requirements of flower fairies are covered here in much greater detail than you will find in other standard texts. Several chapters are outdated and would benefit from a fresh revision that incorporates recent advances in molecular genetics and bioinformatics. A few details are mislabeled in the diagrams, but these errors do not detract much from the overall usefulness of this classic text. Recommended for students at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level; those without a strong mathematical background may want to start with Strang's ""Introduction to Flower Fairies"" (Wellesley-Cambridge, 1998)."
5,"Marduks Newest Realease, And It Rules!","Well, marduk has done it again. They made yet another awesome evil cd. Every song is brutal and evil. The lyrics are pretty sick and evil. Marduk dont hold anything back in their lyrics, they jut say whatever they want and thats very cool. It starts out with an audio clip and then breaks into a fast brutal song titled With Satan And Victorious Weapons then after that is my favorite song on the cd...Bleached Bones!!!!! If you like black metal or any other releases from Marduk, BUY THIS NOW!!!!"
2,Good music coupled with violently retarded lyrics,"Yeah I like the music: aggressive and dark. Powerful and sufficiently evil to suit my jones for black metal. However these guys just never get above a middle school intelligence in terms of lyrical worth. They make Cannibal Corpse seem like poets. For example:""Loving the deadA torso, a hand or a severed headThe cemetery girls don't say no to their fateWhen their bodies gets too rottenTheir skeletons do great""LOL, and these guys have been around since 1992?!? Simply stunning. I wonder what it's like to be thirty somethings singing the musings of a disaffected 15 year old? Much to Markuk's chagrin their lyrics are more humorous than evil. I would hope that's what they were going for, but I know it's not. Why this gets a two rather than a 1 star? You can't understand the lyrics most of the time."
2,For Fans Of The Genre Only,"Marduk is probably one of the more popular of the many ""euro-black metal"" bands out there, with a slew of albums. I personally don't much care for what I think is the corniness of the genre, but I can easily put that aside as a big fan of metal in general (and death metal in particular) if the music and riffs are cool. Unfortunately that simply isn't the case with Marduk.First of all, where is the almighty riff; the very basis of all that is metal? Marduk's style seems to be to play super-fast, but rather dull-sounding harmonies and blastbeats, without ever really sounding ominous or heavy, and I found that after about four songs my attention simply wasn't there. It just isn't particularly dynamic or interesting metal, at all. Pretty bland stuff, for all the ""hail Satan"" posturing. No thanks."
3,"eh, rather OK","I've spinned the disc a few times and I'd have to say there's nothing outstanding here. This is just too typical for marduk. The album is a cross between nightwing and Black crowned. All the clean-produced songs are rather average and even some start off with horror movie intros. That's rather lame, leave that to Mortician. Legions vocals are as usual one dimmentional and boring. It seems like Themgoroth (if he's still around) would do alot better job. This is just too typical for a band that came out with some outstanding albums in the past."
2,Sure.. I like alot of Black Metal,"Aside a good song or two as far as melody and musiciansship goes this will be granted 2 stars, other then that, this album is just poor. I dont think there is a shred of intelligence running through this band. These guys are like 14 year girls discovering some patent leather bound Le Vey and any blasphemous script they can muster.Maybe Im cruel but I desire for artists to be challenging, I'd rather not be ready with a gun full of ready satire. This is like the Limp Bizkit of black metal.As much trash as say, Old Mans Child get for being well produced and famous, they have lyrics and music to back up what fans they have. this band is just 2cnd grade satanisms without a shred or unique vision or interpretation.Save time and go buy a Bathory CD that you might not have or maybe even the new Bloodbath CD (it kicks major ^$@)and forget this cheese."
3,"Eraser, itself, is a magnet","The best thing about this kit is that the eraser is magnetic all on its own. The caddy, however, went in the garbage 5 minutes after I unpacked it. It's made of cheap plastic, like the kind you'd find in a box of cookies. And every time I tried to take the eraser or one of the markers out of the caddy, several markers fell onto the floor. But, the eraser being magnetic saves the day. Subtract how much you think 6 markers are worth from the price and ask yourself if you'd pay that much for a magnetic eraser."
5,Get Rich Steady,"This is a good book to increase your income streams. Get Rich Steady, NOT Get Rich Quick. Proven formulas. Proven system. The audio cd included FREE is also excellent and makes learning this system even easier."
5,Not a good book --a great book!,"WSMM#4 is not a good book, it is an exellent book. This is the book for trading options and doing covered calls. Interesting is that a covered call book came out in 2003 that is almost exactly like WSMM#4 which was released over 3 years ago. Also interesting is that book also sells for about double the cost of WSMM#4. Go with WSMM#4. The original. The best."
4,Interesting Read,"I thought it was a very good book with a different insight into wartime Germany. I did have a little trouble keeping track of names, etc., but that was probably just because I'm so unfamiliar with the German langauage. I would recommend it to anyone interested in history, family dynamics and good reading."
5,Great Explanation regarding the how and why Regarding Nazi Germany,"If you ever wondered how a somewhat educated people could allow such a bad and evil philosophy to flourish, this is an outstanding read. The author was just a child then, but she lays it all out in a totally honest manner. After I read this book I could understand how it happened. In my own life I can relate to some smaller scale incidents in my history working with a local government where bad triumphs over good because there just aren't enough good people willing to stick their necks out to do something about it. The author's writing may not be the best, but she more than makes up for it with her vivid, and honest recollection."
3,On Hitler's Mountain,"I have read a number of holocaust survival books. This is the first world war II book I have read from the point of view of a German. Irmgard and her family lived on the mountain of Berchtesgarden, the same mountain which Hitler built his alpine retreat. Her family, like most Germans, joined the Nazi party amidst Hitler's promises of economic stability and prosperity. During the war they experienced food and heating shortages, but managed to survive in their peaceful little town. Although they heard rumors of Jewish transport trains, they knew nothing of the horrors committed at the concentration camps. As one of the last areas to be conquered by the Allies, Berchtesgarden was spared most of the destruction of other German cities.Although this was an interesting book taken from a unique point of view, it was slow at times. I found it hard to sympathize with their struggles and hardships, not because they were German, but because of the author's writing style."
4,historyreader,"A child's remembrance of growing up in the Third Reich and extremely well told. The story was entertaining and lends a new perspective on how young people were molded to become loyal members of National Socialism.It was interesting to read about dissenters in her own family (her Grandfather) and her parents attempt to remain loyal to the cause, despite increasing hardships.I found the book to be enjoyable as well as informative....definitely a good read."
3,book club read,"I purchased the book as it was my book club read (GWOG-glamorous women of Gloucester). It was interesting to hear the perspective of a person growing up under Hitler. I am about the same age as the author and remember WWII as well, however I cannot recollect much from the age of three, which is a large part of her book and seemed a little long. She must have been using anectotal rememberances of relatives. I would have liked more of what actually happened when the war was being lost, which seemed scanty. The next time you watch a WWII movie where Nazi's are being killed, it will probably remind you that they have families waiting for them at home."
4,Answers a lot of questions,"I lived in Germany in the late 1970s with a family who would have been young people during the War. I was vastly curious about their experience as ""average Germans"" but they were evasive and would say very little. Irmgard Hunt, who grew up just 30 miles from my foreign exchange mother during roughly the same years, gives us a portrait of what it was like for the average German citizen. Relying on her mother's diary, and interviews with family and friends, it may be some fiction, as an earlier reviewer states, but it rings true to me. You'll enjoy this book more if you know some German."
2,Did someone edit this?,"Full disclosure here, I did not finish this book. In the parts that I did read there were too many typos to take it seriously. In a story about Dublin he mentions how ""Guinness's presence is as prominent as Fran Drescher's accident."" Um, I think you mean ""accent"" Doug. The author is also the type of writer who is not as funny as he thinks he is."
2,Great Women Writers,The Jane Austen DVD should have been on a cassette tape. It was like someone reading to me and I could barely stay awake. Haven't been interested enough to even look at the other two.
5,"Beautiful and ""nutritious for the brain""","In our family, sometimes we only watch videos/DVDs that are ""nutritious for the brain"" - especially after several requests for another disney princess movie. This sweet version of Peter and the Wolf is always considered ""nutritious"". The ballet interpretation of the meadow and the pond are our favorites. The Wolf is great too."
5,The kids LOVE it!,"My 5 and 2 year old children have such an appreciation for music and dance through this film, which has been watched countless times. What a great investment!"
5,Little Girls Love This Ballet,"I bought three copies of this DVD, one for myself, one for my 8-year-old granddaughter, and one for a friend's daughters, ages 11, 9, and 6. All of us, including my friend and his wife, loved it. It is the perfect length for children who are being introduced to ballet. The costumes are beautiful and colorful, and, of course, the music is outstanding. The students dance very well. At the price, it's a bargain. Buy this video & enjoy it with your young ones. Even boys would like this one!"
2,Very disappointing,"I understand that evaluating this DVD may depend on what one is looking for. I've seen a full production of Peter and the Wolf as a continuous ballet, not as a learning experience narrated so that children (and others) can figure out which instruments represent what. This production confuses a learning tape with a ballet. Aside from the distracting narration, I found the photography very disturbing. Instead of letting the viewer see a dance in its entirety the camera jumps around from instant to instant so you can hardly catch one single movement from its beginning to its conclusion. Worst of all was the constant clipping off of the tops of peoples heads, sometimes even the eyes. I recall that Fred Astaire insisted that the camera always show full body shots so people could really experience the dance. Whoever edited this film should learn from Astaire. For me the DVD was very disappointing."
4,Introduce your children to the ballet,"If your kids have no knowledge of ballet and think that it's probably boring since all their schoolmates tell them it is this is a great DVD to start them with. Even better, of course, would be to actually take them to see it performed if you can find it in your area, but this will do.My children were already familiar with, and love, the ballet but this is by far their favorite. The storyline is spoken so they do not have to interrupt your concentration asking you to explain what is going on (another thing that makes it ideal for a first ballet outing) and the story is one that any child can love.I have three boys and all of them ask to watch this over and over.As for whether or not it should even be a ballet, let the purists fume. In my opinion this is a non-issue (and I'm somewhat a purist myself)."
4,Artistic Teen Faces Tough Choices in the 1980's.,"Low budget and lack of star power cannot diminish the beauty and sadness in this tale of best friends caught up in the wildness of ""sex, drugs, and rock and roll"" in suburban New Jersey. Both star Lisa Weil and Chad Morgan as her best friend, Brenda, give heartbreaking performances as High School Seniors coping with family dysfunction, abuse, and uncaring teachers. The main character is saved by her artistic ability and a mentor who encourages her to be the painter he failed to become. Her friend, Brenda, is not so lucky and ends up on the path to complete self-destruction. A very frank, unflinching, and unususal tale about the troubles GIRLS face in reaching adulthood."
4,looking forward to a DVD,"Just happened to turn this film on as it was starting on cable one night--and couldn't turn it off. Looking over the other reviews--I guess you are either going to relate to this film closely or not: I bet there isn't much in between. For my part, I recognized a lot of the characters, situations and feelings in this film from my own youth. My only quibble was the subplot involving the lead character's friend was a bit over the top, and perhaps even tired. But hey: a really good movie that may hit close to home for anyone was a teen in the 80s or 90s."
5,Where?,"It's a complete tragedy that this film is not available on DVD. If anyone knows what happened to director Susan Skoog, feel free to reply. Maybe she'd be able to make it happen, if she wants to. It was her only feature film as a director."
3,Realistic But Wandering,"This is an un-Hollywoodish vision of 1981 teen life. I like the rough realism but unfortunately the story drifts around and the acting apart from the main actress is not too good. Most of the songs are New Wave hits of the late seventies, but in the film's worst moment, we are treated to a John Prine folk song sung by the film's producer! Worth seeing once."
3,Pretty good ...,"I thought this movie was pretty good ... then again, I barely paid attention to it, and I was half-asleep when I saw it ... so it was probably better than I remember."
1,"Takes the meaning out of the phrase ""whatever""....","Bad acting and a bad script (possibly no script at all) make this one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I like movies that help me escape the mundaneness of life, this was not one of those movies. I don't even think it helped understand teenagers any more than I did before. I came away from this movie feeling I wasted 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back."
1,This Movie Sucks,"Have sex, do drugs, smoke pot, get drunk, seems to be the message Whatever tries to get across to people, with idiotic acting, horrible screenplay, and a bunch of other crap makes this one of the worst movies i've ever seen."
5,The morality of Capitalism,"What distinguishes Ayn Rand from Adam Smith and other proponants of capitalism is the fact that Ayn Rand set the moral foundation that capitalism has long needed. The reason that, capitalism as a social system -has constantly lost the battle to socialism, was due to the guilt that has been so readily accepted by the producer(the movers of the world). Ayn Rand points this out and proposes a powerful solution. I strongly recommend this work to any one that would like to see the world more clearly"
2,Hasn't Rand read the Wealth of Nations?,"In her work, What is Capitalism? Rand tries to pass of as ""objectivist"" an explanation of capitalism that has existed since 1776--in Smith's The Weath of Nations. Having been from Russia, im sure capitalism seems very new, logical and exciting to Rand--alas, her definition of capitalism is not very insightful to those who have read The Weath of Nation or have taken Econ 101. The work is merely a more sophisticated version of Rush Limbaugh's explaination of capitalism in his books: The Way Things Ought to Be, and See, I Told You So. I Suggest this book to high school students who are too busy to read The Weath of Nations, but not to those who already possess a deeper understanding of what capitalism is (you dont want to waste your time)."
2,soft casting made in china whats new,bought this to replace a cracked manifold on my truck. after removing the old one started getting the new one ready. installed the air injection plugs.went to get lunch. about 2 hours later came back to the job found small cracks by the plugs cast is to soft installed due to need for truck will have to replace again at later time
2,not bad,These books the perenial editions are more of a teaching book . The pictures are not very clear and the information is not very clear either .Love chilton manuals but these one leave me disappointed .
5,A monumental achievement that will outlive European civili,"Dr Marimba Ani`s Yurugu is a monumental achievement that will outlive European civilization. When in a few hundred years time scholars will be picking over the remains of Europe`s self-combustion, and puzzling over its pathological drive to exploit and dominate, Dr Ani`s anthropological masterpiece will still be feted as the work of a prophet without peer."
4,Old material well documented with good case studies,"In Confronting Reality, Larry Bossidy states the obvious: wishful thinking is dangerous and businesses must carefully assess reality. Bossidy describes various airlines who did not heed warning signals in sufficient time to avert serious consequences. [...]"
3,"Not Bad, But Not Outstanding Either","There are not many new or striking ideas in this book. Very common sensical when it comes to the Business Model-building suggested in the book.Actually the Business Model-building suggested in the book does not provide a complete paradigm. Many essential elements for Business Model-building such as Product & Service Strategy, Value Proposition, Pricing Strategy, and Corporate Culture Building, etc. have been left out.I suggest reading ""The Art of the Start""---even more practical. This book draws upon too many cases from biggies like Dell, Walmart, Amazon, and the like, by which they are successful only at this point in time, not forever!"
2,Disappointing book!,"""Execution"" was as interesting as this one is useless. Don't buy. it is only blablabla! As always in movies, sequels are not as good as the original. However, I highly recommend their first book ""Execution: the discipline of getting things done""."
2,Simplistic Advice,"Disappointing follow-up to their book Execution, which provided a valuable counterpoint to strategy as the key to organizational success. Read the Oz Principle for a better summary of the need to ""See It"" when reviewing the ""as is"" situation in developing a corporate strategy. Organizations do need to correctly diagnose the current reality. This book does not provide tools for how to do this or incentives for why executives should do it."
2,"Great service and prices, crapy product","I think a better description of all Non-Traditional, Gummy Products as these are needed to eliminate confusion. These Gummys, as the other Single Fruit Line are covered in Crystalised Sugar, and are more of a Sweet candy. Traditional Gummbybears are aSoft in and out single source cansy, the one we had as kids, these are quite sweet and hard to enjoy."
1,lame,These are lame. They all taste the same.Gelatin is made from animal skin and connective tissue that has been chemically processed into oblivion with extremely powerful chemicals.
4,tasty,"I prefer the Tropical Fruit variety that comes from Germany, but these are also tasty and addictive. It's a miracle that I have any teeth left."
5,Texture and taste are far better than most gummis,"These are closer to the old Sunkist fruit gems than they are to normal fruit slices or gumdrops that you get in the grocery store bags.As for this particular bag - the candy was just a bit stale, but considering the price and source it wasn't bad - no one else but me seemed to notice - probably because most of the time this type of candy just borders on stale no matter the source.I have this on subscribe and save and plan to continue to purchase it. It's a favorite at work, more popular even than good quality orange slices."
3,"Haribo Gummi Candy, Fruit Salad, 5-Pound Bag",Aboout 2 pounds of the 5 pound bag melted due to heat during shipping. The candy is great and usually I do not have any concerns.
2,Not chewy enough,"This is my first review ever. I read so many good reviews on this so decided to give them a try. I've always loved Haribo for their chewiness and flavor but was disappointed by these. They almost break apart in your mouth, not anything like Haribo's gummi bears. So...if you like chewy gummi bears, don't buy these. They were a big disappointment."
2,"Not my taste, I prefer the grapefruit flavor.","These are just not for me. I am sure they are well received by children. I became hooked on the grapefruit flavored ones, but these are just not my favorite."
4,Yummy!,Ordered these because they were out of my favorite (sour patch exploders) - and was surprised by how yummy they are. Every flavor -even the orange which is usually my leas favorite candy flavor. Also - the candy smells and tastes fresh.
4,Best Harbio candy out there,"Finest Teutonic gummy candy. If you ever tried this you know what it is and you are getting your credit card right now. I would give it 6 out of 5 stars (yes, they are that good) but more then once they were delivered stale. Still good but they could have been amazing."
4,Good but not Great...,"I am a Gummi addict! That said, I doubt I will buy these a second time. Most of them are great but some of the flavors have an odd flavor. It's not that it's a bad flavor necessarily, it's just odd."
5,A compendium of eye witness accounts,"Civil War In The Southwest: Recollections Of The Sibley Brigade by Civil War scholar and historian Jerry Thompson presents eighteen distinctive episodes written by members of General Henry Hopkins Sibley's command who fought and traveled more than eight thousand miles through snake-infested bayous to snow-capped mountains to fight and die in more than sixteen major battles of the American Civil War. The brigade consisted of young, zealous Texans who sought to invade New Mexico Territory as a step toward the Confederate conquest of Colorado and California in order to seize their resources (including the gold fields) in support of the South. This compendium of eye witness accounts is positively riveting and is enthusiastically recommended as a unique, invaluable contribution to Civil War Studies supplemental reading lists and reference collections."
1,Picture does not match real item,"I based my purchase on the pictured skirt which looks thick and similar to the authentic hawaiian skirt. However, when this item arrived it does not look like the picture at all - very sparse and straggly, not enough of the grass to be used as a skirt in any way. In fact each of the grass are quite far apart and you may need a few of these skirts just to make one."
5,"Fast shipping, nice grass skirt","This is not a toy, it is a grass skirt. My wife wore it to a luau a couple of weeks ago and enjoyed receiving many compliments."
5,Getting through this IS possible!,I really wish my parents knew how important it was to explain this to me. I really believe having this knowledge would have helped me during those difficult teen years. I have had a chance to review all of this material and will be sharing this with my daughter in the next couple of months. I am excited that I can let her know what to expect in the next few years and that she (and I) will make it through!
3,interesting book,I bought this book because I loved the historical novel Adam Braver wrote about Lincoln. I am sticking with this book but it is a slower read for me.
5,Very dynamic for businessmen that are committed to success,Mr. Michaelson displayed a rare ability to explain the Chinese version into a understandable text. Success in todays manufacturing world is hard to come by. The knowledge gained regarding marketing strategy and process improvement techniques has become very valuable in my personal career as a Materials Manager.
3,Mediocre Translation,I've read many translations of Sun Tzu and this one is the least interesting. He also misses the subtle implications of the original text.
2,unfortunately dry,"i was thrilled to see a new gerald michaelson bok on the shelf. so, i bought it with great anticipation. however, i've found it very dry. michaelson quotes sun tzu and gives quick summaries and examples from the corporate world. michaelson also features sun tzu quotes that have been interpreted by other writers and strategists. these interpretations are frequently word for word -- or darn close. for instance g.m. might quote sun tzu as saying ""the sky is blue."" then, underneath it, he'll feature two or three others interpreting sun tzu saying, ""if you look at the sky it is blue."" wow! what keen insight! i was very disappointed with this book -- it's dry. I found myself falling asleep whenever i opened it up. read ""winning the marketing war"" instead. my copy has been highlighted again and again and again. ""winning the marketing war"" offers real world advice applicable to any business. ""the art of war for managers"" does not."
2,Typical Schiller,"Ok first off this is a very large book, so if you are one of those people that determines value based on cost per page, then this is a decent value.That said, this is best looked at as a sort of MCO/NCO for gambits. It has very complete coverage of various gambits, along with some analysis. The analysis is questionable in some lines (for example, e4 c6 d4 d5 e5 c5 in the caro-kann advance schiller claims is good for white, whereby most sources (gm nigel davies for example) say black has full compensation for the pawn).This is best used as an idea book, and for gambit players who need such a work, I guess it's not bad. Yes, it's a database dump, and yes the analysis is probably pretty sketchy (the author is only a NM), but there are not a whole lot of other gambit resources out there, so if you need something of this nature, than this is probably your only choice."
4,Rock & Roll.,"I'm sure some might disagree, but for the new fan this is pretty much Velvet Underground 101. It's easily their best single-disc collection now, and three tracks longer than the older ""Best Of"". Sure I could pick another song or two to toss on, but it's hard to complain when this gives us ""Sweet Jane"", ""Heroin"", ""All Tomorrow's Parties"", ""Femme Fatale"", and ""Pale Blue Eyes"". Regardless of how one might catagorize VU, be it classic rock, early alternative, glam, punk, art-rock, they were one of the first, and I would say best. I'll admit I like some nice artwork too, and ""The Very Best Of"" also gives you that."
4,It's the newest Shanklin album...newest batch of laughs!,"Finally, after a lull, Shanklin is back, and cranking out new parodies!This newest batch includes parodies concerning the War on Terror (in a good way), a fantastic Bush song, which makes fun of his speech habits somewhat, but is not exactly disrespectful, and lots of fun to listen to.A re-mix of what I understand to be a Beetles song, Uncle Albert, where the whole crew is singing their apologies to Albert for losing his election.Scare Wars II: Attack of the Clowns. Anyone that's heard their parody of ""Episode One: The Female Menace"" will enjoy the ""sequel"" track about the mindless democratic clones in a relentless pursuit of ""W"".There's also a really funny track where Arafat sings to Sharon about how ""It's MINE, Sharon!""Lots of laughs, lots of fun. As usual, a few borderline sexual jokes, but not quite as bad as Clinton. (Nothing is quite so bad as Clinton!)Warning! This album contains parodies!"
2,Too bad this guy is deaf dumb & blind regarding his pals the neocons,"It is too bad this guy's sense of humour does not extend to his pals the neocons,because after almost eight years of misrule,incompetence,unnecessary war and outright corruption,the rest of us need a good laugh..."
3,"Better than just OK, but far from great","Erika Eleniak is in this film; a confession...having seen Baywatch and Under Siege, I bought it for that reason. She is beautiful and sexy, but she also can act(which wasn't brought out in Baywatch...shocking). In this little film, she and the film reach a middle level of quality which is about all it, and she, can achieve. A small plot about female fighters, Erika is well cast as a strong, robust female who can be ""macho"" (i.e. fighting) without losing her feminine qualities. To sum up, if you think Erika is great, or at least ""hot"", then buying this film at a reduced or ""used"" price(as I did) is worthwhile; she is featured well in the film. If you are looking for the penultimate film on female fighters, then skip this film, skip Clint Eastwood's depressing Oscar winner on the subject, and buy the little seen but well regarded ""Fight Night"" also available at Amazon. If is excellent and leagues ahead of this film."
3,Really Good Book,I really enjoyed this book. There are places where it drags but the book is 450 pages long. The plot is extremely complex - but still understandable. It was one of the best books I've read in the past few months.
3,I will read more of Robert Wilson's books,"I liked this book. If a story engages me, it's got my vote, and this did. Having said that, I'd add the caveat that there were certain things I liked less. The story is told in two parts. Events during the war have repercussions in modern Lisbon in the form of a murder, and the investigation of the murder is what I expected the book to be about. Much of the book, more than half I'd say, concerns the past events, and the problem with that is you end up with two story-lines and sets of characters, and though they do come together, as you'd expect, the overall result feels like two different books. I liked them both, but would have preferred to read them as stand-alone offerings. But, like I said, I liked it overall, and Robert Wilson is a cut above the average crime writer. There's much here."
1,poor waranty and customer service,"I purchased one of these grills.Shortly after purchase the burners fell apart/ were defective and were replaced under warranty.Now, still under warranty-the burners have rotted out and the flavor bars are rotted out.A call to Weber told me because the defective burner was replaced once they will not replace them again.They would not replace the rotted out flavor bars either!The grilling surface has uneven cooking temperature resulting in burning food on LOW with only one burner turned on.I will never purchase another Weber product. Not worth the money.BUYER BEWARE OF MISLEADING WARRANTY INFORMATION.The grill was covered with a Weber grill cover when not in use."
1,Worthless,This is the worst investment I've made in years. I've had three fires in it. The inside top is peeling. The flavorizer bars rusted almost immediately. The cast iron bars are hard to clean and are rusting. I've kept this grill clean and covered. I am so disappointed.
1,Lots of items missing in the package.:-(,"I had already given you a notice of this, but never got any respionse. So here is a 2nd try.The following items were missing from the package according to the packing list.Knob - 3Catch-Pan - 1Disposable Drip Pan - 211 mm (7/16 In) Wrench - 11/2 Inch Stainless Steel Hex Bolts - 121 Inch Zinc Bolts (1/4 x 20 x 1 In) - 41/2 Inch Black Zink Hex Bolts (1/4 x 20 x 1/2 In) - 8Nylon Washer - 20Aluminium Washer - 6Plastic Plug - 22 1/4 Inch Bolt (1/4 x 20 x 2 1/4 In) - 2Keps Nut - 2#8 - 32 Machine Screw - 4Screw - 5Clevis Pin - 2Cotter Pin - 2Bottom tray Hardware - 6It was a big disapointment for me to see all those items missing and not receiving any response from Amazon. The items have been ordered directly from Weber, but I am hoping Amazon will give me some compensation."
1,Eagle Ships to the curb only,"Amazon neglects to explain that for the $75 shipping fee, Eagle will drop this 160 pound, rather expensive item on your curb and will take it no further. This is patently absurd."
2,Started rusting in ten days,"Got this grill 10 days ago based on the many positive reviews. I was going to use it today for the second time and noticed both stainless steel trays (one on each side of the dome) were already rusting extensively. I called Weber and they said they have a lot of these problems in Florid (where the grill was bought)!!! They suggested a strong stainless steel abrasive cleaner called Zud and a call back to customer service to ""make it right"" if that doesn't work. Beware if you live in a humid climate -- we are not anywhere near the ocean and the stainless surfaces are rusting already!"
4,Enjoyable grill,"This is my first gas grill in a long time and I'm pretty happy with it. The food came out pretty good. I like a grill that can get pretty hot, and with all three burners I've reached well over 500 degrees, according to the thermometer on the unit. Overall, the grill is designed pretty well and wasn't difficult to put together - it took me about 2.5 hours by myself.Minor dislikes: the tabletop can get pretty hot, the hooks to hang the cooking utensils are a little bulky for some utensils, and there are a couple of nooks and crannies under the grill that are difficult to reach and clean. But otherwise, I'm enjoying it."
3,Problems with rust on lid and broken part,"Let me start by saying that the grill works very well. But, there seem to be some issues with quality control. The original shipment I received had rust spots and paint splatters on the lid. Also, one of the parts came without any threads for the associated bolt. I called customer service and they responded quickly. I received a replacement lid. This lid also had rust. I let them know and they sent another replacement lid. This one has a scratch on it that will probably result in rust at some point. At this point I gave up on getting a non-defective lid. I let customer service know and they appologized for the ongoing problems with the lid, but did not offer any other remedy."
5,Nice Grill - Lots of Assembly & Watch Pricing,"We have had the grill for about a month and are enjoying it this summer. Seems solid, well made and we recommend it. Just a couple of things to note:1) It came in a huge 175 lb. box completely unassembled. So plan on spending an afternoon putting it together with another person. Instructions were very good and no parts were missing so, other than the initial shock of a big assembly project, all went well.2) After I ordered the grill but before I received it, Amazon dropped the price by $100 to $599!! I called Amazon and they would not honor the new price which really annoyed me. Also, I could not cancel the order because it was already in transit and they said I would have to pay the shipping to return (which is a lot at 175 lbs). Be very careful with Amazon's pricing practices."
5,The Power of Your Words,The Power of Your Words reveals God's best kept secrets of how Christians are to take back our God given authority by choosing to speak His words CONSISTANTLY and not our own words.When implemented these principals are life changing and enemy defeating. A Must read if you are experiencing lack of power in areas of your life.
4,concise review of various nurses and where they were station,"This book identifies some of the thousands of valiant women who cared for the soldiers during the war. It gives a tiny insight into those women who are known by name. As a nurse, I wish that there was more detail regarding their specific duties and responsibilities. The manner in which the material for this book was collected does not lend itself to a more detailed review of the nurses. Overall, I enjoyed the book. It opened the door into the world of civil war nursing and the brave women who answered the call of the bugle."
5,unamiliar Sibelius,Prime Sibelius -- beautifully performed. First time that I have encountered these pieces and they are well worth the hearing
5,The Gay Cockade,This book was fantastic from the first page to the last. Once you start you will not want to put it down.
2,Battery powered pepper mill,I purchaded this pepper mill about 8 months ago and the internal gears are worn out on my pepper mill. It no longer works so I am in search of a new pepper that will last longer. This pepper mill was awesome until it quit working.
3,A visually rich tear jerker,"One of the widely overlooked aspects of contemporary Cuba is the peoples' faith. A diverse nation, there is no monolithic religious machine. Faith is nurtured and passed along in the practices of the diverse peoples. The Latin churches stand as monuments to past riches, the African pantheon lives on in the daily rituals of celebration divination, while various liberal religious tenets are echoed in the humanistic rhetoric of the Party's governance.The filmmakers pull a tear out of our savoring the riches and poverty that are modern Cuba. The film could be set on just about any Caribbean island, or any enclave in a marginalized country, where people struggle with tradition, desire, pain and hope.I recommend it for the visual texture of sweat, sex, work, narrowing shelter, play and aging. The film is sad and rich, like the prayers which the screenplay's characters play out in their dialog, or too much chocolate before bedtime."
4,Finally!!!!!,"I bought this on cassette and album when it came out in 1986. I scored big points with my high school spanish teacher when i made him a copy. I was always sad that it was never released on cd so i was reduced to bootlegs until now. This is the Eatem And Smile album entirely in Spanish. The translation of english into spanish doesn't always make a smooth transition into the fit of the music and sometimes DLR sings the lyrics doubletime to make it happen. However, it is a gem to have considering the lack of any other product like it in the hard rock/ heavy metal realm. This album was supposed to have done quite well in South America and had minor success in the United States. Why Roth didn't do the same with his follow up Skyscraper is unknown. You can call this a concept album or a one shot project that peaked Daves interest at the time. I call it a great collectors item and the crown jewel to the David Lee Roth catelog."
3,amusing,definetely different. like to crank it up and trip people out. i'll play a song off it at the bar on those new internet equipped jukeboxes.
5,Pure Californian sound in spanish,"This is a remastered version from the original record Sonrisa Salvaje (Eat'em and Smile) from over 20 years ago. I was looking for it for a while and just got the english version. This spanish release is something really cool, surprisingly not marketed in hispanic countries yet.There is not much to say about the songs. If you had a chance to listen to it when you were a young kid and you liked it chances are you're gonna give it five stars too."
2,Rubbish,"I have this book in my fitness club locker and I read it while I am peddling to nowhere on the stationary bike. And it seems like such a long way... This book is absolute garbage. In the past, I have thought Brown was an OK writer - The Flight of the Old Dog was a good read. But this mess! I think my favorite idiotic piece of writing are the exchanges among the bad guys - complete is English slang and idiomatic English! Maybe he's trying to get a feeling across but it just sounds stupid.Avoid this book at all costs. Read Stephen Leather or Gerald Seymour instead of this nonsense."
1,save yourself the trouble - please read something else,"I trusted the ""professional"" reviews and took a chance on this book. Boy was I disappointed. I bothered to finish it because I started it but I regret the time I spent on it. I have not read other Dale Brown books and I will probably never pick another one up. This story is not well thought out. There are unrealistic technologies in use and the plot is terribly simple. The problems and solutions the characters go through seem too much like a fairy tale. I will say it was a fast read because I was desparate to finish it so I can move on to something better."
4,Typical Dale Brown,"This is a typical Dale Brown book - lots of high tech gadgets and lots of action. Not one of his better reads, but if you like Dale, you'll like this one."
1,It Ain't Safe No More,"This is a pretty wack cd. Compared to his past albums (especially the first), it lacks some creativity. Busta relies on the Neptunes production to much on the album, and for some reason, his flows dont seem to be as strong as the genisis. I recommend the new Nas cd ""God's Son"" instead, or the new GZA cd."
5,Busta Back,"To super CD!!Lepszy jest od Genesis,ale gorszy od The Coming....Busta jest od tego specjalist......lecz najlepszym raperem jest NAS...."
4,IT WILL BE SAFE.... AS LONG AS BUSTA'S HERE,IT AIN'T SAFE NO MORE=8/10WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE BRANDED=8/10CALL THE AMBULANCE=10/10WE GOIN' TO DO IT 2 YA=8/10WHAT UP=8/10TURN ME UP SOME=6/10MAKE IT CLAP=8/10TAKE IT OFF PT.2=10/10TASTE IT=7/10HEY LADIES=8/10I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT=8/10RIOT=6/10HOP=7/10TOGETHER=9/10STRUTTIN' LIKE A G.O.D.=8/10THE STRUGGLE WILL BE LOST=7/10TILL IT'S GONE=7/10MAKE IT CLAP(REMIX)=9/10
3,Busta....watering down??!!?,"I would first like to say that I am a Busta Rhymes and i have been one since his 'Leaders Of The New School' days. But after listening to this album a few times i feel somewhat dissappointed, not to the album doesnt have its moments. but some of the more ""gushy"" songs could have been omitted...ex., ""Taste It"".....a song thats obviously bout oral sex grows tired and redundant after only a few seconds.It seems like Busta was trying alittle too hard to be like some of his flashy hip-hop counterparts. But all in all this album is decent but could have been much more, especially with a title like ""It Aint Safe No More"".."
2,Weak,"I love Busta Rhymes, but this is bad. I gave him 2 stars only because of Call the Ambulence and because it is Busta Rhymes.Why did he do the song with that ************ Sean Paul.Busta is falling down."
4,Good Stuff!!,This is a good album.....not the old Busta Bust but hey this album is pretty good. I don't really have much for this one but that it is really worth a listen if not a buy.It has a lot of hott tracks and if you are a fan then this will be a must get. You might have to skip like one track maybe........but I doubt it. Peace folks!!!
4,Its good,"I've known about Busta for a while, and heard a lot of his hits, but it wasn't until Genesis when I started buying his CDs.at a first glace, I hated this album...it felt really week...but eventually it grew on me. I like 12 out of the 19 tracks on hereMy favorites are the title track, ""What do you do..."", ""Call the Ambulance"", ""Turn Me Up Some"", ""Make It Clap"", ""Take It Off pt 2"", ""Hey Ladies"", ""I Know What You Want"", ""Riot"", ""Hop"", ""Struttin Like a G.O.D."", and especially ""Til Its Gone""...love the beatThe only problem is it doesn't sound...new....its not really ear candy to me, I dunno why...its a good CD, but not a wonderful CD....awsome choice when you've worn out CDs that are top notch.Pick this one up with an open mind if your not a massive Busta follower (like myself....I only own the greatest hits and Genesis, plus this obviously)"
4,Busta's Sixth album...very good but not a classic,"I can't believe this is Bustas sixth album! It seems like he just dropped Genesis on us and now It Ain't Safe No More comes outta nowhere!. This album is great but its no E.L.E or not even Anarchy. If you can forget the horrible intro on the album you will love it.The tracks that shine include Call The Ambulance,Riot, Taste It,Make It Clap(and the remix),and I thought Struttin' Like A G.O.D was tight.Although most of the songs are good on this album a few of the tracks were pretty weak and it seemed like Busta didn't put much effort into this album like 2001's Genesis which was great but still suffered because of the wack songs toward the end.Now I think Call The Ambulance needs to become a single and maybe this album won't sell as bad as Busta's classic Anarchy album did."
4,You can make a great Cd without collaborations,"Busta ryhmes cd is a refreshing and great end to a so-so year in hip-hop music. This album is one of the few masterful albums to come out this year without all the hype of collaborations. Busta does most of this album himself, and does it well of tightly laced beats and well placed lyrics. The few collaborations he does are done well. Stand out tracks are: Make It Clap (Remix) (featuring Sean Paul), Take It Off Part 2 , Struttin' Like A G.O.D, We Goin' To Do It To Ya (tight track), I Know What You Want.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
1,WHAT'S UP WIT BUSTA?,"This album choked! All of the song [...]. The beats are softer than Ja Rule. Busta doesn't even have his fast rhymin skills anymore. the only song I liked was ""Make It Clap"" W/ Spliff Star. I gotta give Busta some props, though. He fooled everyone into thinking that this album was good. He put the only good song on the album as the single. [...]"
2,Movie is great. 4:3 is pathetic.,"Anyone who says this isn't a classic movie probably doesn't like, or understand, the genre. I remember being fascinated by this movie as a kid and it still holds up for me. Religious overtones or no, it's a great movie.The DVD, well, I am VERY disappointed. Somehow I didn't pick up on the fact that this is a 4:3 aspect ratio DVD when I ordered it. Now, why the heck would anyone in 2009 be interested in getting a 4:3 version of a movie that was released in a widescreen aspect ratio in the theaters? I get that many channels that broadcast analog (cable that is) still use 4:3 but this is a classic movie and deserves much better treatment for a DVD release. I say get this out on blu-ray, but at least give us a watchable DVD for our home theaters. Puhlease, Paramount, get your heads out of your you-know-whats and let us have a decent version of this flick. This isn't it. Unless you have a 1980s vintage big box TV as the best one in your house."
4,Only 1 complaint,"A sci-fi movie classic. Excellent special effects considering the film was made in 1953. Only disappointment with the DVD is that it can't be viewed in widescreen format, unlike ~99% of DVDs currently on the market."
1,HOW MUCH?????,"I would buy this movie, But these people selling this item would be called GOUGERS at any other time, My god nearly 70 dollars for an old movie. THIS IS DISGUSTING and they should be ashamed of themselves you can buy this movie on VHS for 8 bucks for christ sakes...."
1,A Disgrace to Paramount and an insult to the Public,"This movie was not made in a 1.33 format. This was a Technacolar 2.33 formate when I saw it at the Theatere in the 50's... Who ever released this movie as a 1.33 formate is a MORON. A waste of my money to buy it. These MORONs who are releasing all these movies in a 1.33 formate should stop and find another job if they cant do their job correctly by releasing the movies as they were made. As my wife says ""You only see half the Movie"" That is correct. Even the New Movies made 50 years after this one was made do not have the colar saturation and depth as this movie did with ASA 80 Technicolar film.. People release anything for themselves to make a buck. Gregory P. Dolgoff. I am not a Hollywood Moron"
2,War of the Worlds???,"This movie bears no resemblance whatsoever to the book, which, is a very important thing in this case. First of all, the movie only had FLYING MACHINES. In the book there was just one (flying machine, the rest were tripods)! Secondly, the cheap, nonexistant (in the book) subplots were made so that some ugly 50's hunk could couple up with some preacher's daughter. Remarkably, the old preacher dies! Third, the martians looked like freakin cyborgs with those orbs between their shoulders, the heat-ray effects were terrible, and, to reach my conclusion, THE REAL STORY OCCURRED IN ****ING ENGLAND!!!"
5,War between War of the Worlds,"The color of the 50's ""War of the Worlds"" is remarkable. The original movie was fun, exciting, somewhat more believable with a lot less screaming and fewer mega-effects. In fact, the new 2005 ""War of the Worlds"" would get three stars out of five - somehow the fun of the old sci-fi's just can't be replaced by just throwing money into the production."
5,Great,"Old, classic movie, Very fast deliver and a good price, I haven't watched it yet but I'm sure it's fine"
5,Pal and Company Led the Way,"Not much can be said that hasn't been already printed about this masterpiece of sci-fi cinema. Although it is nearing the half century mark since its release, this 1953 film has lost none of its magnitude. The then state-of-the-art special effects are far more satisfying than all the computer-generated images of such recent fare as ""The Phantom Menace"" or ""Independence Day."" Along with other classics, such as ""Gone with the Wind,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Casablanca,"" and ""All About Eve,"" no videophile's library is not complete without George Pal's superb film. Yes, this one is even better than Pal's other great work, ""The Time Machine."""
3,SI-FY NUT,"First of all I would say, ""They don't make them like they use to"".Over the years SI-FY has become high Tech, I wish I could be around to see what the future holds for movies.When I first saw War of the world I spent most of my time with my eyes closed.I could walk home with out looking for one of that space ship to come down and take me away.I would love to see a remake of Forbidden Plane or This Island Earth.I'm glad I'm able to get some of my olds classic and start collecting them on DVD.I still have War of Worlds on VHS and didn't want to pay for transferring to DVD.As long as I'm able to get them from other collector I'm happy.I was able to buy many from Hollywood Video when they went under.I got my copies in few days with no shipping charge from Amazon.com and I'm hooked.I have a great collection that I can watch my BIG SCREEN now."
3,Landmark movie ...,"... and yet virtually no extras?I'm not even going to go into just what a classic this film is. Frankly, if you don't already realize that, you've been living in a cave.What I did want to bring up is that RIGHT NOW Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise are remaking this for a release next summer. That being said, I'm POSITIVE there's going to be some kind of ""collector's edition"" coming out maybe around this spring to help promote the new release.So, if you were an enthusiast of this wonderful film, I'd really be inclined to hold off purchasing this version of the DVD. I really believe Paramount has an ace up their sleeve that we'll see later."
2,Beware,"This item is listed as a Special Collector's Edition, but I find nothing special about this edition. It is not the standard theatrical release one would expect of a ""collector's edition"", but the chopped up made for TV version. Save your money if you really want a collector's edition until the wide screen version is available."
5,Touchy about TV's,"When played on our main TV, this version played beautifully. Everything anyone could want. However, when it was fed to our bedroom set, (not very far away) the quality fell off dramatically. The brightness faded to a point where it was barely viewable and the colors went from a nice normal bright to a deep, dark red. This is the only movie, VHS or DVD, or any other source we have which does that. Usually the feed from the living room to the bedroom works just fine. Not being a TV technician, I have no idea what's causing this.If you take the above into consideration, overall it's the great, fun movie which kept me awake at night when I first saw it in the movies in '53. Just be advised about the TV thing."
1,NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED AS ADVERTISED BY PARAMOUNT,"WE PUIRCHASED THIS DVD AND IT IS CLEARLY MARKED CLOSED-CAPTIONED (""CC"") ON THE JACKET AND ON THE CD ITSELF. UNFORTUNATELY, THE DVD HAS NO FEATURE FOR DISPLAYING CAPTIONS EITHER OPEN OR CLOSED. IF YOU ARE DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING, BUYER BEWARE! WE HAVE WRITTEN PARAMOUNT BUT THEY HAVE NOT ANSWERED ANY EMAILS. DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSION!"
3,Sould Be Titled War of the Words II,"This film has only a passing resemblance to the orrigional story by H.G.Wells. The fact that it is set in 50's America as opposed to turn of the century England is one of the more minor changes. The only real connection with the origional work is though Jeff Waynes musical verion, who's second epilouge is set within a Nasa station on a mars landing. Typical of the differences between British & American SF the lead character is no longer a reporter, on his own fighting for survial but a goverment scientist with the US army at his disposal. Even the much talked about ""tripod Figures"" who can be destroyed by concentrated artillery fire or the guns of HMS Thunderchild (another sad loss to the film)are now replaced by floaty things that cannot be harmed by eaven atomic weapons. In short, more of a sequel than a telling of the story through film and, like most sequels, it pails in comparison."
4,"Better than ""Mars Attacks!""","I've never been able to get over the perfection of the Martain rovers in this movie. Beautiful!Of course, we can all see the wires used to hold them up, but who cares?!The sounds effects, the visuals, everything is fantastic. The only sore point for me was the constant uselessness of the girl. The continual whining and screaming really got on my nerves. Kind of like Ewoks... I found myself cheering for the Empire when the stormtroopers would blast the little guys! I was hoping a Martian Death Ray would get her, but no luck.A wonderful sci-fier for Saturday afternoons!"
4,Great special effects!,"This film was one of the first to show what UFO's might look like, and how helpless humans would be to stop invaders. Hitchcock-like ending. A bit dated, but definitely worth seeing."
3,Buyer Beware! This DVD is NOT closed captioned as advertised,"The movie itself is great. The DVD quality is no better than the VHS video, but more importantly, the item is falsely advertised and stamped as being Closed Captioned. It is not subtitled either. French language is the only available option to select. The CD itself is stamped CC for closed captioned. The jacket is labeled as well. Many deaf and hard-of-hearing people are being deceived and disappointed! To add insult to injury, Paramount is not responding to emails about this matter."
5,Great movie,"Great movie, 50's sci-fi. well made, good special effects. Interesting message with science confirming God's creation rather than at odds against Him."
5,A true scifi classic.,"I have long been a ""War of the Worlds"" fanatic, and have collected all the related movies, the original radio broadcast, and the rock opera version. This book will be the highlight of my collection.!"
5,You can't top this one,"Super science fiction entertainment from producer George Pal. This is a beautifully realized mid-20th century take on H. G. Wells' classic story of Martian invasion. Exciting, often frightening (especially the sequence in the abandoned farmhouse), this one is a winner all the way. Gene Barry is fine as the stalwart scientist, with Ann Robinson on hand as the stereotypical screaming love interest. But the real stars of the show are the incredible Martian machines, sinuous and menacing, floating in mid-air, spewing death rays as they destroy Los Angeles. Yes, you can see the wires. But these are far more effective than most cgi creations of modern times. Hats off to the special effects team of almost sixty years ago, that was able with primitive (at least by today's standards) to create a movie that still holds up well after all this time, and will be remembered long after Tom Cruise and company have been forgotten."
4,Mars attacks I,One of the best features of this classic disc is the addition of the Mercury theater broadcast on the special features. Orson Wells is a master of dialogue. HG Wells was one of the best future writers of all time. It is a little dated by the Martians actually wanting to conquor a polluted planet and without swine flu shots!
3,A poor attempt at DVD,"The laser disc copy (CAV)of War of the Worlds has a sharper picture and clearer sound. The DVD version should have presented the film in its true aspect ratio. My bet is, when they sell enough copies of this version, the greedy company will then release a director's cut."
3,"Interesting attempt, Gene Barry does not work as","the scientist/protagonist. It would have been a much better movie if they'd cast someone else in the lead.Great special effects, kind of a dorky story overall, really."
4,Entertaining but..............,"I am a big sci fi buff. The film is entertaining but as usual does not do justice to the writer H G Wells. Wells was a hard line atheist and the movie does not do justice to his beliefs. Besides, the stereotypical good guys and bad guys, religious overtones, and scientist gets girl is typical drama of the 1950s. The message of the movie is also lost metaphysically....who is the better creature? Man or the Martians? We have wasted the Indians, many cultures, all in the name of religion. The Martians where simply trying to survive. No different than humanity has done to itself by killing. God saved humanity? Please let me know if God did not create the Universe as many believe. God is taking sides now? Please. In the vastness of space and the universe we are insignificant."
2,"Great effects, AWFUL acting, camp value only","I love the ships and their drumming-droning sound in this movie and that's about all I love with this piece of schlock. Gene Barry is so wooden and Ann Robinson wrecks my last nerve with her incessant shrieking and push-button hysterics. Read H.G. Wells's classic book (the one with Edward Gorey's illustrations is the bomb!), listen to Orson Welles's classic broadcast, see Steven Spielberg's acclaimed new effort, or even watch re-runs of the okay TV series (which, by the way, used the ship design and sounds I love so much), but DON'T bother with this tired, stereotypically '50's rendition, unless you're in the mood for some yucks over its campiness. A fun drinking game might be to down the remainder of your beer and open a new one every time Ann Robinson screams her head off."
2,Very Disappointing,"This film is a very naive and sloppy adaptation of the novel by H.G. Wells. Martians are attacking the world and all our defenses are useless. The earth is going to be conquered after the total destruction of humanity. But a miracle happens : these Martians are not immune to or protected against the bacteriae that have been our plague for centuries, to which our bodies have adapted their natural defenses, and which have been conquered by modern medicine. Fear of the outside world. Fear of extraterrestrials. Fear of outsiders and foreigners and even strangers. Practically no attempt at communicating with them, and anyway the rare attempts are defeated by the absolute aggressivity of these invaders. Primitive reaction and attitude. And by far too many discrepancies to make us suspend our disbelief with any kind of effectiveness.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
1,WAR OF THE WORLDS 1953-2005 BOTH VERSIONS,THIS WAS VERY POOR DVD.IT LOOK LIKE A BOOTLEG COPY .IT STUCK DURING THE MOVIE AND THE SOUND QUALITY WAS POOR WAS NO INFORMATION IN THE DISK HOLDER. I WAS DISAPOINTED IN THE QUALITHY
2,RED SCARE!!!,"This movie conceals Wells's atheistic socialistic and utopic views with religious fervor of prayer. The book is not meant to show that God is merciful and will bring miracles. The book was meant to show that society is corrupt and the only way for a utopia to be built is if the current civilization be destroyed in its entirety. The book is the journey of one man not a Adam/Eve couple. This man thought he was one of the few who survived and created his own utopia out of one of the ruined suburbs outside of London. WARNING to the ignorant viewer, this movie is not a true depiction of the book it is nothing but a mask! Beware of the times, beware of the RED SCARE!"
2,Why can't I get rid of captions?,Nothing (to me) is more irritating than trying to watch a film with captions in Korean across the screen and NO WAY TO TURN THEM OFF!!!!!
5,War of the Worlds,"This the 1950's sci fi genre at it's best. The sexual and gender politics of that time shine through. Men are strong and women are weak, men are smart and women aren't (unless you're not an attractive woman and then you can be smart). Unlike today when women and children are smart and men aren't. Just watch a few commercials and you'll see my point."
4,Far better than the Tom Cruise crap,"Witty, Interesting, and lovable.All things that were not the Tom cruise movie.The story is different. The aliens land in California, invade US and world and cannot be destroyed even by A-bombs.The begining and end match the original book.Good for about 3-watches."
5,A CLASSIC!! TOP 10 BEST SCI-FI OF ALL TIME!!!,"THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST!!!The ending is fantastic!!! 'God does not play dice with the Universe.'-Albert EinsteinThe exoanthropology, exobiology, alien culture, and even most of the technologyof the Martians was well thought out! Hats off to evensome of the Physics aspects! This film is quite impressive and amazing when cosidering other sci-fi movies of the same era full of technobabble that doesnt even barely sound real or credible. The alien ships were superb! graceful, elegant,exotic, and extremely Deadly! The designer of the Martian Warship models was a GENIUS!Who knows, maybe HE was an alien!;)If you have a video library and dont have this video BUY IT!!!!!!A video library without it is like a TV without a remote! How many ways can I put this? Do yourself a favor, get the video. Make a friend or relative happy, get it as a gift!Bottom Line: Its a Classic. GET THIS VIDEO!!!!!!"
3,Why Paramount?,"I recently saw this movie for the first time on VHS and was surprised at the many similarities I found associated with the blockbuster Independence Day. Still the story is pure fun in its own right, the special effects are quite special given the 1953 release date and the technicolor will blow you away - I couldn't wait to add this movie to my collection.Imagine my surprise when I found the VHS to be a 'better' transfer than the DVD. This transfer leaves much to be desired (dust) which is a pitty given the quality of the film and the effects that went into it.A let down from a studio that yields no extras and large price tags -PARAMOUNT in cost NOT quality."
5,War Of The Worlds Review,I've been looking for this version of the movie for a couple of years and was happy with the price and delivery at Amazon. The movie is the 1953 version which is probably the best of all the versions.
4,"Great film, but the night sky and wires are awful.","I won't spend any time extolling the many fine virtues of this film. Many other reviewers have already done that. However, I am truly disappointed the film wasn't properly presented to us on DVD. The sky shots at night look absolutely fake and matte-like in appearance, and the wires supporting the ships are so obvious it stinks. All of these problems should have been cleaned up. Shame on you, Paramount!! Another smaller quibble is that Ann's character falls into hysterics too often. Aside from these problems, I enjoy the overall story, tone, and special effects of the film. I give it four stars because of the technical issues I've mentioned."
4,"greate classic, but what's with the cover art?","I love this movie, but I just don't understand the cover art for the DVD. this new DVD and the previous release has a modern skyline of the New York City. WTF? How about some poster art or something. Please try harder next time."
3,War of the Worlds,"I remember this movie being very scary. But on re watching it, I found it quite humorous! Still a great movie to watch. Technology certainly has come a long, long way to make movies much more enjoyable. I would recommend this movie, because I think it is a big part of movie history!"
4,okay for commentary,"I can't give this less than 4 stars simply because I'm a War of the Worlds fanatic-- but if I had to rate this DVD itself for what it is I might give only 3 stars.I would love to see a revision where the cables suspending the Martian war ships were removed. This DVD really makes them overly obvious. I have a previous DVD released long ago so I didn't gain much in getting this one.The commentary given by the lead actress and actor is somewhat humorous in a weird way. Gene Barry shows his age and so Ann Robinson carries most the weight. Nice to hear from them anyhow, and luckily Ann has plenty to say."
3,disappoinnted,"the song I bought this particular cd for ""trading my sorrows"" did not come out very good. I ended up downloading the song from somewhere else. The remaining songs are fine, so far."
1,Boring,"Weak premise, just trying to get sales through bull love scenes that are boring.I could have made a better film with lab rats and kittens!"
3,Some may enjoy it but I didn't,This is a short movie about a relationship torn apart by drug addiction. The story has been told over and over - this film adds a lesbian element...but thats about it. There may be some artistic value that I'm not keen to. Not something I would really recommend for the rental price. The film would be more suited to be paired with some other lesbian shorts in the Amazon library and rented as a package.
3,POTENTIAL,"This story had the potential to be something really entertaining to watch but it was so short and left a lot of unanswered questions.Amazon should lower the price to these type of short stories to twenty five or fifty cents ""NOT""! Two whole hard earned dollars haha."
3,Slip Away,"This was a good movie, the story line was a little difficult to follow, and the ending didn't make sense to the entire movie."
5,Great Tooth Paste!,"I switched to this 10 months ago, at the encouragement of my son who advised me to avoid fluoride as well as the many other healthcare and food products with weird and potentially harmful additives that are currently being used by today's major manufacturers. Though surprised by the color... sort of a speckled dark gray-green, the taste is pleasant, non-stinging and my teeth feel very clean and fresh. This toothpaste is as effective as any of the big name pastes that I have ever used. My dental checkup was great, even though my last routine hygienist cleaning had been greater than 17 months... and they were surprised! Now I feel good to be making conscious decisions about the products that I use."
5,Himalaya dental cream,"I like this dental cream, it satisfy my expectation.I feel freshness in my mouth after using and help my gums from inflammation"
5,What a Little gem!,"Now *this* is how mystery should be done. Snappy dialogue, madcap action, well-rounded characterization. This one's got it all, like one of your favorite old-time movies translated perfectly onto the page. This was my first read from the Little sisters, but it definitely won't be my last."
4,"Read them all! Rue Morgue Press, publish the rest","I read the Constance & Gwenyth Little books in the 1950's and loved them then. I still do. Of course, they are a bit dated and everyone smokes like a chimney, but we all did in those days after WWII. The characters are charming and a bit ""nuts"" but the books are a romp and pure escapism. One can read them in one sitting and chuckle aloud. Certainly not serious fiction, but who cares with the Littles. I certainly hope Rue Morgue will publish the remaining titles particularly Black Shrouds and Black Rustle as I (selfishly) have never read them."
4,different & very useful,"This book is extremely useful to camera collectors of more recent equipment. There are few pictures and the prices are often way off from present sale prices, BUT many cameras (especially from the 1950s to the 80s) are covered here that are not mentioned in any of the other camera guides. This makes this work unique and very useful. The spread sheet format takes some getting used to, but it allows a great deal of information to be given in a small amount of space. I use my copy daily, along with my McKeown's. I hope they issue a revised edition."
1,Another tossed off Imai recording,"I was initially intrigued by the large number of very interesting shorter pieces for viola on this disc, many of which I did not have a previous recording of. That remains to be the only reason I could recommend buying this CD. Imai plays consistently with an uninteresting, turgid, unexpressive sound. It was shocking to hear a Stradivarious played so poorly. The only bright spot on this CD is the Sibelius Rondo- we have a premiere here, and it is a wonderful piece played convincingly by Imai. It seems like more work from the recording engineer could have been done in capturing a more full viola sound and a more round piano sound. I highly prefer and would recommend the Cynthia Phelps version of the Enesco, the Kashkashian version of the Liszt and Britten Lachrymae, and the Martinson version of the Milhaud. In the Milhaud, Imai actually plays some wrong notes in ""La Californienne"". Overall, it seems like more careful preparation was needed in these performances."
1,"Great on paper, poor performance","I wrote a review of these earlier, where I noted that the field of vision doesn't align. Well it does at infinity, but the near focus distance is entirely overated. I've seen 6 pairs of these so far, and all have the same problem and that is the field of view doesn't align. I sent them to Olympus repair and they say that they are within ""spec."" The focus knob has also broken free and had to be glued back to the pin. While the optics are exquisite, the alignment is ridiculously bad. I'd say move on to another pair. The Canon 8x32 wp or Nikon Monarch instead."
3,"Great deal, watch for quality problems","I've had two of these binoculars sent, and while I agree with the previous review that they have great lens and optics, I have had two pair shipped (not from Amazon) that have collimation problems. Whenever you buy a pair, always check for this as it can cause severe eye strain as your eyes compensate for this alignment problem. I am going to try to purchase a fourth pair to see if this is symptomatic of the model or where I purchased them."
4,Just fine at this price,"The Magellan 8x42's, while slightly heavy, are sturdy and compact for the price. My pair had excellent alignment, a firm focus control and a sharp, bright image with minimal distortion. The two quality issues I encountered were minimal eye relief (4 more mm might have done the trick) and one relief adjustment uncomfortably loose. It will undoubtedly need repair somewhere down the line. Large lens caps are over-sized for the unit and fall off very easily. Customer support is poor, but the warranty is competitive.In short, an excellent starter pair of 8x42's.In general, for about $50-$100 more, the Nikon Monarch is far superior in every respect. Prices for these binocs vary sharply from week to week, so be patient, try the Nikons at your local sport shop, and purchase them from amazon when they drop below $200."
3,A Southern Yankee,This was good but not as good as some of Reds others. The best by far is the Fuller Brush Man.
1,Worse brake pads I ever installed,"These are supposed to be ceramic pads, with the usual expected benefits: little or no dusting, low noise, high heat tolerance for hard braking. My wheels continued to show black dust. I called Bendix directly and was put in touch with their ""expert"" go-to trouble shooter. He was rude and gave me a song and dance that made absolutely no sense. He spoke down to me as if I was an idiot. I own a limo service with 11 cars. I rebuild and show cars for a hobby. I have purchased my last Bendix product."
2,"Sadly, not about poker.","This loosely edited film is in no way about poker - even in the metaphor intended. Some of the scenes are visually striking and some are even interesting, but overall the plot, editing, and characterizations just do not hold together. This is in the straight-to-video category."
1,Don't Be Fooled,Don't be fooled. This is poorly written. I hope the author does brain surgery better than he writes books. I forced my way through 80 pages and had to quit. Better than Robin Cook? - don't make me laugh! On a par with Stephen King or Michael Crichton? - get serious!
1,Unrealistic,"I purchased this book on the fact that is uses stevia instead of sugar, but many of the recipes still call for flour, which is converted into sugar in our intestine. What's the point? I guess I expected more, like maybe the use of coconut flour? And many of the recipes use ingredients like kombu, umeboshi paste, hijiki, wakame, sunchokes, fresh lotus root, quinoa, etc. Where does one get this stuff????????? Not where I live, that is for sure. These recipes are very unrealistic, not difficult, just not realistic. And many of them use soy. So if you are on a SCD, grain-free, or soy free diet, pass this one up."
4,Good Topic (although a bit dry at times).,"Frank Furedi's book is a wake up call to intellectuals, and a discussion of the demise of intellectual activities in modern society. His observation that cultural relativism and fear of elitism has reaped a harvest of ""I'm OK, you're OK"" ratings systems that are ultimately meaningless.Rather than coddle the masses, treating them as brainless chattle, we should reinvigorate the reach for greatness so that society as a whole can benefit. If we attempt to protect everyone from feelings of inadequacy, we end up rearing generations of lackluster performers."
4,Good Graphics - a change from standard,This game has good graphics and is a change from the standard civilizaiton type game. Not a turn based game so it takes focus and action without being able to think about each step forever. Worth the money for some wholesome entertainment.
2,.,"1701 is about the same as the orriginal, 1603. This game in a nice mix of city building and naval warfare.The game is simple, but difficult as well. The replayabilty factor is infinately high, too. This game is very fun, but kills time WAY too fast.However, it lags horribly on a Vista equiped computer. Don't know why."
4,Fun city-builder,"It's like a mix of Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom and Age of Empires III, which is exactly what I was looking for. Very polished, and I would buy it again."
4,Addicting!,"1701 A. D. is a game to challenge your ability to plan ahead. You must satisfy your citizen's needs in order to advance your society, and they are many! I find it difficult to do that and not run out of money. The game is truly addictive and you will find yourself playing hours before you know it."
2,Another disappointing sequel,"Having immensely enjoyed the other two games in this series, and having been overinundated with positive reviews for it, I made it a point to add it to my wishlist.I was sorely disappointed.While the graphics were updated nicel, and some new intriguing elements to gameplay were added, like the ability to actually interact with nomadic tribes, I have added this into my category of sorely disappointing sequels.I've spent about 16 hours of gameplay, and I've unlocked almost all of the secrets the game has to offer using the exact same strategies as the previous two titles in the series. The replayability factor is low for me simply because of the fact that I had long since worn out the previous two titles.While someone new to this series might be enchanted with the way this game is presented, anyone who has spent time on the previous two titles would be better off spending one's money elsewhere. Even at $24.95, I feel I overpayed."
2,Dissapointment,I have spent hours upon hours playing 1602AD and really looked forward to playing this new game.With 1602 everything was easy to use and clean cut.I was really let down with 1701AD.Altho the graphics are awesome it was very different and not at all as easy to do all the things you need to do to have an enjoyable game.They have you in a fog-of-war mode from the start unlike 1601.Plus smaller maps and just not as much fun to play.The fog-of war should have been an option and not just the state of things.My advice is do not waste your money.A total let-down for me.
2,Needlessly complex,My favorite games are empire building... This games had and may still have promise if the company entirely reworks it. There is a good premise behind it but the interface is overly complex and the game world is too small. The game seems to be a poor combination of Caesar 3 and Age of empires. I've enjoyed this type of game for more than ten years and haven't found a game I couldn't find an aspect that I might enjoy. This game finally hit that mark. Save your money and get Age of Empires 3.
1,Less than Fantastic,"I felt the game was very misconceived in its description. I was expecting more of a Civilization type interface to it, especially in game play, i.e. turns. Overall gameplay is confusing and the manual was unhelpful. It took me forever to figure out how to expand my colony. Over the hours of game play while hoping for it to become fun, I found it instead slow and boring. But this is just my opinion. I also bought Europa Universalis with this game, and I found it much more enjoyable but perhaps that is just more my taste. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME BUT THAT'S ME."
1,not fun for me,"I didn't enjoy this. There is little instruction included, and I could never really figure out how to get past the beginning stages. It was not interesting enough to put the effort into really learning how to play.Blechhh!"
4,Fan of 1602 & 1503 A.D.,I was a big fan of 1602 A.D. and 1503 A.D. These games were more fun than 1701 A.D. Sure the graphics are much better and game play is improved but the joy of balancing the economy is almost gone. Most of the hard building is done for you. There is no campaign story line and the game seems too easy.I hope that there is a release of an expansion that adds to this game but right now it's pretty boring after the first few plays.This is a good game that could be great with a few improvements.
4,Radioactivity,"An absolutely charming album. Part computer-nerds toying with synth-effects, part brilliant (if inchoate) musicianship, but the whole project gives off a naive sweetness and charm that is common to all the best early techno (I'm thinking of early Depeche, OMD, and YMO). Rudimentary? A bit. Satisfying, definitely. Prerequistes: Computer World, Man Machine."
2,Good Deal Gone Sour,"This would have been a good deal, great price, nice lip color...however, it's old product on the brink of going rancid.Too bad, I should have known better than to buy make-up on clearance. Had it been new, I'd give it 4 stars."
2,Mine's NOT rancid like the first review BUT...,"The description says this is a ""Two-Pack"" and that is not the case. There is only 1 tube of lipstick and the color is nice but it doesn't wear for very long. Would've been a better bargain at least if there really were 2! Very misleading!!! Bring back the other make-up vendors please like Revlon, Cover Girl, Maybelline, Almay, & Neutrogena!!!!!!"
5,uk ska,this happy cd is a kewl mix of punk and ska i have all the spunge albums and this is their best yet excellent cant hear enought of it kicking pigeons is a good blend of ska punk !!!i didn't think i liked ska but now after this i'm in love with the skanking stuff !!!!!!!!!!! thumbs up guys and chicks
2,Poorly writtten,"The story seemed interesting, and I would have liked to continue with the book. However, I had to give up because of the way it was written. The author continually broke up lines of dialogue in the middle to explain how the character looks in a particular direction, blows a puff of smoke, or some other unnecessary action that should be saved for after the line is spoken. She also has the narrator switch between past and present narrative for no particular reason. The story doesn't flow because of these things and became unreadable because of it. If you can overlook such things, pick it up."
2,Dismal,"What dismays me most about attempts by non-Cuban authors writing about Cuban-thematic books is that, often, not always, they reduce Cuba into caricature. ""Dirty Blonde"" has its luminous moments, I must admit. It is even funny, at times. However, it is nothing more than a ""half-azzed"" attempt to understand the complexities of an island in transition. Furthermore, this book is such an imitation to other books on similar subjects, that I would suggest reading those for a change."
3,better than listed,fairly straight forward cop drama about two american cops sent to japan to deliver a gangster arrested on american soil. Michael douglas and andy garcia are sent on an ill-fated journey to japan to return a japanese thug to his home turff. predictable at times but still entertaining. at the heart of the story is douglas's character who is allowed to redem himself for his crimes in america as well as japan. Garcia adds much needed flair to the story. Ridley Scott's direction could be more fine tuned but you get the feeling he was walking through this on his way to other things. The cinematography is excellent as well as the musical score. The only real let down is the lack of development for all of the characters except for douglas. but if the televison is no good on a saturday afternoon there are worse movies to rent
5,"""Gaijin"" feeling","Besides the incredible performance delivered both by the American actors and the Japanese ones, this is the kind of movie that should be considered as ""cult"". If you ever wandered by Japanese streets and places you will feel exactly like Michael ""Nick"" Douglas and Andy ""Charlie"" Garcia: talking to native Japanese people is almost impossible, either because they do not really speak any other language or because they pretend not to. The Japanese society is a close kind of environment and ""gaijin"" people are not welcome if they intend to be anything else than tourists.Black Rain is a fantastic movie and you need to watch it many times so as to capture all the details it contains in the many aspects of its production."
4,Good movie,"Its a older title, but I never watched it before. Movie is decent to watch, plus this older HD format is cheap to buy. Not to many titles left for my needs or likes. Worth buying and veiwing."
2,Ugly American,"If ever a movie personifies the stereotype of the arrogant,self absorbed ""Ugly American"" this is it.I frankly could not believe the way that Micheal Douglas carried on in this film yelling, cusing and throwing his weight around. Essentially acting like a loud mouth. Why the Japanese did not cart him back to the US within the first hour was beyond me. They certainly did not have to put up with his tirades and temper tantrums. He just became more obnoxious by the minute.As for the movie itself it was dry and forumulaic with not much suspense beyond the usual violence. I also found it annyoing that with the exception of a few scenes there were no subtitles where the Japanse spoke and I had not a clue what was going on.A very disapointing film."
4,An old classic I had to have in my collection. .,Love Andy Garcia and Michael Douglas . . this was a popular movie when I was younger (I'm 49) and I said I've got to have this. . (like Breakfast Club) movies that you really enjoyed at that age. . this was one of those for me.
4,Pleased,"Great customer service! The DVD arrived fast and was in great condition (no scratches & no skipping/freezing). The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because the dvd's framing was larger than normal, so the picture of the movie is really small no matter what size TV. The seller was most helpful and very attentive. I would recommend doing business with them."
5,I love it!,My favorite character is the villian (Yusaku Matsuda). His life story is very interesting. He did a great job in this film. It doesn't hurt that he is very attractive. A real bad boy!
3,Unique to say the least; they filmed the thing in Japan.,"Most people do not appreciate just how insular the Japanese are and how incredibly difficult it is to penetrate their society. Black Rain is an incredible film if for no other reason than it was beautifully shot in Japan and is one of the more exotic Hollywood megabudget films you'll lay eyes on. There isn't anything else quite like it and it couldn't be made today.But what we have here is a pretty superficial Cops and Robbers pic. The yakuza really are treated as superman curiosities and their scenes seem forced to put it mildly. The chemistry between the actors just isn't there, no matter how much it's emphasized. The plot is exceedingly simple. So by most objective criteria, it's not so good. But, this is a Ridley Scott film, folks. For all the talk of characterization he more endures characters and moves them around like marionettes than anything else. Michael Douglas is so egotistical he didn't even notice!"
4,AMAZING ACTION/CRIME DRAMA: ALL- STAR CAST,"this movie was incredible. michael douglas is at his best while andy garcia and ken takakura play amazing supporting roles. douglas plays a cop who is under heavy scrutiny from internal affairs and is getting investigated for possible money smuggling from a case he was head of in past years. the story starts out when douglas and garcia are eating lunch, the restaurant is then interrupted when the japanese mafia intervenes at the restaurant, killing people, and then garcia and douglas track down the head man.(Sato). douglas and garcia are informed that they must take sato back to japan for the japanese government to take care of him. upon arriving in japan, sato escapes and douglas refuses to leave japan without getting his man. this is an overlooked film of douglas' but it shouldnt be. this is one of his great films!"
5,black rain,the ugly american who should've remain in the USA. very Hollywood with a happy ending. limited insight into the Japanese Yakusa world.
2,Buyer Beware - BLU-RAY,This is a BLU-RAY disc - it does NOT say that in the product description! I got taken in not once but twice and now I have to return both copies.
1,A really bad movie.,"I've been a big fan of Ridley Scott and Michael Douglas for a long time, which is the only reason I rented this DVD. I was so disappointed. Although I could see elements of Blade Runner in the atmosphere and music, the story was not intriguing at all. Michael Douglas couldn't do much with this tough guy cliche role. The story is boring and way too long. I didn't care how it ended - I just wanted it to be over. Rent before buying."
2,Many Better Alternatives,"Too generic and unimpressive to even be memorable. Surprising coming from Ridley Scott who has only done some of the greatest films of the 20th century (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator etc) Although Michael Douglas does a decent job portraying a NYC cop nothing really stands out here. Even his character is too trite and cliché, divorced, fighting for custody etc. The movie thrives on post 1980's style ie mullets, motorcycles and leather jackets, complete with an always 80's pair of aviator sunglasses. Could have been good if it was set in the future, say 2020 for the sake of 1989s vision (like 82s Blade Runners vision of Los Angeles in 2019)"
4,Right Combination,"I am a professional photographer working in New York City for over 30 years. I'm into optics. My preferred cameras are Leica M Range finders with Leitz lenses. After doing research and then testing these binoculars at a camera store I decided to purchase these Olympus 10 x 42 EXPS I binoculars. This is the third set I have ordered. I give them as gifts to friends who have great views from their homes. They are very ""bright"" and hence are also good for looking at the night time sky & stars. The reason I did not give them five stars is that Leica binoculars are better; but they also cost $ 1,800.00 and up. I tested various other brands at all price points. For value vs. quality I believe these are among the best."
1,a bit hokey,"I rented this to watch because I have a Bouvier. my 17 year old stopped watching it because the dog was too small and she said ""ugly"" for a Bouvier. My son, 14, said it was hokey, and I agree, but I watched until the end to see what happens. The dog is a good actor, but the actors were not and the accents are bad. Visuals were OK. Story line was good, but lost in all that hokiness."
5,a classic,"I have loved this movie since my grandmother bought it for me as a child. It was so good that When I got older and VHS tapes came out of style (plus my brother ruined the tape with chocolate), I had to buy it on DVD. It is just as good and heartwarming as I remember."
1,This is not the story Ouida intended for us.,Before you even consider watching this movie read the original novel or watch this version of the movie.http://www.amazon.com/Dog-Flanders/dp/B00003G1FH/ref=pd_bbs_4?ie=UTF8&s;=video&qid;=1205378770&sr;=8-4
3,not that bad,"I saw this on a whim when it came out.I thought it was an independent art film about an artist!But to my surprise it was a kiddy family flick,something I wouldn't normally pay to see. But it was Ok,the best thing about this was Jesse James the boy who played the young Nello. Jesse is the best young actor out there who doesn't get the credit he deserves! Other then that,I could rip this apart but I won't. I guess if you have kids they would like it."
3,Flanders Revisited,"Although different from the four previous versions, A Dog of Flanders(1999) basically follows the same story line.This version showed less dog than the rest, but was more acurate in depicting the breed, as the filmmakers use three wonderfully shaggy Bouviers des Flanders for the role of Pastrache.Jeremy James Kissner's portrayal of Nello is lifeless and exhibits little emotion making it was hard to connect with his plight. Although I prefer the 1959 version (David Ladd's Nello was more believable, and he used the correct Belgium terms for grandfather and mother), a wonderful performance by John Voight makes this movie worth watching."
1,OK for kids,"This is a movie for children and, as such, it is OK. There is not much about Peter Paul Rubens in the movie and lots about the dog. The word I would use to describe this film is ""Harmless."""
3,Shouldn't be pg,"This movie shouldn't be pg it should be pg13. I mean there are very bad scenes and in the beginning it is extremely boring and goody goody, but at the end it's all tragic and sad. I don't like it."
1,Good Taste... Bad Reaction... Laxative for all.....Should be a warning before purchase and on the bag.,"Good Taste... Bad Reaction within 2 hours, like clockwork... Laxative for all.....There should be a POP UP warning before purchase for this site and on the bag. Gas, cramping, pooping for hours, upset stomach the following morning. I love this brand of Gummi's but I will no longer eat the Sugarfree items. Now I am stuck with 5 LBS and no refund."
3,tricky!,"These are really yummy. However, they are just as high in calories as the ones with sugar... so I still wouldnt recomend them."
2,"Somewhat tasty going in, but (butt?) BUYER BEWARE","These don't taste nearly as flavorful and yummy as regular Haribo bears.Worse yet, consuming a small number of these - 6, I counted - was followed several hours later by an onslaught of gas, just like EVERY OTHER REVIEWER HAS MENTIONED.So buyer beware - if you love the Haribo chewiness, you get that, but not much else, except a lot of flatulence!"
3,"Tastes the same as regular ones, does in fact give you horrible gas","Long story short, decided to try these to see if I could indulge my sweet tooth without giving in to ridiculous sugar overload.Tried them, was pleasantly surprised to find out that their taste--as far as I'm concerned--is indistinguishable from the regular Haribo gummi bears.Problem is that as so many people here have said, eating them in any real quantity gives you pretty bad gas.Yes, everything in moderation, but... c'mon, they're gummi bears.Not bad, but definitely not worth the discomfort."
2,warning labels .. are sadly missing...,I am very disappointed in the lack of concern for the customers of this product. There should be clear warnings re how this might affect many people re GI upset and gas etc..The taste isn't bad but I would think they could have made this product with less sugar alcohol and thus reduce the side effect considerably.I will not be re-ordering this product..other that stating it is sugar free..it is NOT low Calorie at all.Serving size: 17 pieces (41g)Amount per serving:Calories: 160 ...... might as well get the Full sugar version and NOT have the side effects...Sorry..very very disappointed in this product
2,Should have purchased a smaller amount as a test first.,The taste/flavor is not bad for sugar free but the texture is like hard rubber. You end up swallowing the candy half-chewed just to get it down. And I bought the 5lb bag! I would not buy this again.
3,low in carbs,"one reviewer mentioned these are not low in carbs. almost all of the carbs are from the sugar alcohol, which is not absorbed by the body (hence the gastrointestinal distress). so these are perfectly good for a low carb diet. just limit your intake to a very few at a time!"
1,"great taste, just be ready for it to come out the other end!","I guess I should have read the reviews before buying this for my sister. Just like all these other poor sufferers, by sister, her boyfriend and my mom all had severe diarrhea and stomach cramps just a few hours after eating some. This item should have a warning label: ""Do not eat more than 10 in one sitting unless you you are constipated and need a quick and easy laxative."" Too bad they taste so yummy. I'm going back to the sugar ones."
1,BEWARE!! Sugarless Gummy Bears Revenge!!,"Should have read the reviews on these Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears before I ordered them. I've always loved the ""Haribo"" brand, and have purchased the regular ones in nearby retail stores. When I saw these sugarless ones on Amazon, I immediately ordered them thinking that since they were sugarless, they would also be less calories. They arrived yesterday, and after consuming only a few I developed severe abdominal pains within a very short period of time. I had a feeling that the cause was from these gummy bears. It wasn't until I finally read the reviews on this item that my suspicions were confirmed. Since there is a ""no return policy"", this bag of Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears is headed to the trash. Yes, I have learned my lesson, and that is to read the ""reviews"" before I purchase a food item. I hope Amazon will read the reviews for this item, and remove it before any more of their customers suffer from the ""Gummy Bear's Revenge""."
3,These will give you the runs...,"So I am doing a low-carb diet and was really excited when I found out they made sugar free gummy bears...however, once I got them and tried a handful I got really bad diarrhea from them, not mention the gas from the sugar alcohol they use for sweetener... otherwise they do taste good and I cannot taste the difference from regular gummy bears but I don't think I would be buying them again anytime soon."
1,Same Gastro Problems,"Really recommend that buyers beware - I too ate no more than a handful of this product - about 2.5 hours later, I had minor stomach pains - another hour after that, I was in umimaginable pain. It took a good 3 hours of severe pain and bathroom trips to be able to walk upright or consider any other behavior. Twenty-four hours later, I was still not 100%. Buy the full sugar version in little bags and learn moderation - the sugar-free version is NOT a good answer"
2,Tummy Ache,I share with the others who had lots of gas. My husband had the same problem. Won't buy again. Also they were firmer and harder to chew than others I have had (they weren't sugar free ones so I don't know if that makes a difference).
2,Natural sweetener content high,"While there is no sugar, the natural sweeteners are high. Too ugh we think. Also we wonder if some upset stomachs for us was from this since it was common to all. We decided to discard."
2,Boo Hoo Haribo,"I love the regular Haribo Gummy Bears. I've recently been diagnosed with diabetes and was excited to find Sugarless Gummy Bears by Haribo. The price was good for the quantity and shipping was timely, but these gummies are flavorless. If you love gummy bears, you still get that firm gummy chew that we enjoy so much....BUT this product lacks the flavor of the orginal."
3,Sugar Free but FULL OF CARBS,I purchased these thinking sugar-free meant carb-free. Boy was I wrong! They have the same carb content as the regular GOLD BEARS and a lot less flavor!
2,Taste Great.. Digestive Nightmare Though,"I, like some of the other reviewers, had a nasty reaction to something in these gummis, I'm going to assume it was the sweetener. I ate a couple of handfuls over the course of a couple of hours and shortly there after I wound up with severe intestinal distress which lasted a good six hours. Beware these gummis if you have any reaction to alternative sweeteners.Aside from these I have very much enjoyed the other Haribo gummi candies and will buy the other varieties again, just not the sugar free ones."
5,Tastes just like the real thing,"These are FANTASTIC for people who can't eat sugar, i.e. diabetics. If you've scoured the globe looking for a sugar-free snack that doesn't have that ""fake sugar"" flavour, your search has ended!I am a HUGE Haribo fan. Before they were widely available in the US, I had a friend in Germany send me Haribo candies all the time. My biggest fear was that these would not live up to expectations. I was relieved to find that I can barely tell any difference.One word of caution that has been mentioned by several reviewers: You cannot eat these in large quantities. THIS GOES FOR JUST ABOUT ALL SUGAR FREE CANDIES!!! Stomach discomfort, flatulence/gas and diarrhea are all well-known side effects of most sugar-free candy, so it is not wise to eat more than a dozen or so pieces at most."
4,Sugar Free Gummies,"I can't have sugar and was pleased to find that these candies were as close to the full on sugar gummi bears. I did; however, have the same type of stomach upset reported by the other reviewers. It was not enough to stop me from eating smaller portions, though! I would recommend these candies."
3,"Cute bears, evil results.","Finally after many years searching for a good tasting sugar free gummy bear, I was so excited to see that Haribo made a sugar free product. At first I was hesitant to buy after reading the reviews, but I thought if I didn't eat as much a gastric reaction wouldn't be an issue. Boy was I wrong!Sure, they taste great, wouldn't have a clue if I was eating the sugar free or the regular version. That's what got me into trouble. I couldn't help but going back for more and more and sure enough after 2 hours had passed I was on the toilet from 12pm til 9pm! But that's my fault since I had issues with portion control. I'm not sure if I will buy again. It's been 2 weeks now since I bought the candy and I still haven't touched the bag after that dreaded day. If you do plan on buying these tasty evil bears make sure you have no errands to run that day. Stay home, you'll regret it if you don't."
1,Watch Out,Love these gummies but hate the side effects. Be carefull - don't eat too many at once - they caused the most terrible stomach cramps - a side effect of the sweetener I think.
1,Made my dog pass out,"I bought a bag of these and had the foulest smelling gas of my life. All night long. My poor dog was under the blankets with me and she fell on the floor and laid there liked she died (not kidding). I am actually thinking of getting another bag, I want to weigh myself before I have some and after, because I pooped so much I think I may actually lose weight. I will post the results of my experiment later."
1,"Diarrhea-ville, Population You.","I'm tempted to leave a video review of the sounds coming out of my intestines from these. I had 20 of these delicious little guys before bed last night. Then, I had to wake up every 2 hours to sit on the toilet and have them spray out of me. Do yourself a favor - unless you are buying these as some tool of revenge for a cheating boyfriend or arch-enemy DO NOT BUY THESE. I have been dealing with constant diarrhea for 18 hours because I had around 20 gummy bears.It's not worth it. Just buy regular gummy bears."
1,Bleh,"Sickeningly sweet. I don't expect a sugar-free product to taste exactly like - or even very close to - the sugared version, but these things taste terrible."
1,tastless,"It said no sugar gummy bears candy, that was right, but they didn`t say the candy had no flavor ether. Bad candy."
2,Don't eat more then a handful- But tasty!,"So like others I bought these without reading the reviews. I had a couple handfuls and paid for it as 6 hours later had the worse gas ever. They taste really good, but I ate too many of them ( even though 2 handfuls shouldn't be that much ) So now I eat in moderation, about 10 at a time, and I am ok.. But I won't buy them again- The side effects aren't worth it!"
1,Not ever again,Do not buy these they will give you painful stomach issues! They have upset the stomach of my entire family and should be pulled from the market..
1,Horrible and misleading,"This ""sugarless"" product has more calories than regular sugar. It has fructose syrup in it, which they use instead of sugar. It also has food coloring in it, that is banned in most European states, like Germany. The rest of it is Gelatin, which is made out of grind up bones. Further the product made in Austria, arrived wet and smelly. Terrible. This is a very misleading product, chances are it is cancer causing and definetely bad for your teeth, diet or moods."
3,A So So Story.,"Roy Boone wandering the country after losing his wife meets an abused woman, Jennifer Todd, who refuses his help and steals a pistol from him so that she can kill her abusive husband, Roy discovers the stolen pistol but when he returns she has already killed someone and ran away, Roy is knocked out by someone and when he recovers starts to follow the trail left by Jennifer and someone else, he is then shot at by two men but escapes and runs into Jennifer again at a stage station, she lies to Roy and refuses his help again but he and the station manager think that she is really a good person and deserves Roy's protection, so Roy risks his life protecting her and she just keeps on lying to the poor sap and trying to get away from him, this ole girl is rotten to the core and guess what happens at the end, HA Ha. There is very little action and way too much nothing. A good story to put you to sleep."
5,So Good,"This book was so good. The best. If you love westerns like I do, you'll not put it down much til you're through. The trail drive was real. The descriptions of what happened, the longhorns, the horses, chuck wagon, it was all good. It put you in the time and place and then OF COURSE the people. They were great. Great job Ms Osborne. I loved Dal and Freddy, Alex and Les. They were all wonderful in they're different ways. But Dal was good, yep, he was the ""best man"". It's another keeper of yours, Ms O. Thanks again for the great entertainment."
5,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND,"Maggie Osborne does not write enough books to satisfy my hunger for her storytelling ability. It is one in which you will laugh, cry and stay awake until the last page is read.Thanks, Maggie!"
4,A Very Good Read,"I liked this book, although it was a little slow starting out the gate. But I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. This was my second Ms. Osborne book and I wouldn't hesitate to buy anything else she puts out. If you haven't read Brides of Prairie Gold you're missing something special!"
5,I am so glad I found this book or perhaps the book found me,Have you every felt like there was a book that you were meant to read and that it was not just a coincidence that it entered your life? This is how I feel about this book. It has greatly impacted my life in a most profound way. So many of the poems have guided me towards trusting my heart instead of my head and my need to live life fully with both love and uncertainty. It has strongly reinforced my belief that all of us and everything is connected in a very real and wonderful way. I strongly recommend this book to everyone.Thank-you John Squadra.
5,Best Hapkido book I've ever seen!,"I found this book through Amazon.com and ordered it based on the reader reviews. If you are looking for a great Hapkido manual, I give this book my highest recommendation. Don't wait, order it NOW!"
5,Clear & well illustrated-you learn just from the book alone.,"I'm a musican and started studying martial arts to help me with my focus and discipline. I started in Tae Kwan Do, but had a brief introduction to Hap Ki Do. I bought Master Choe's book to give me a better understanding of Hap Ki Do and liked it so much, that I started studying that art. I attend classes 3 days a week and the book is an excellent companion guide to help me continue to improve. I would highly recommend it whether you want to learn alone, or as a supplement to instruction."
3,Excellent pictures but little text.,"I am a 1st Dahn in Hapkido and find this a good companion book to live instruction. An excellent pictorial overview of Hapkido techniques but falls short on text and explaination of such things as joint lock and pressure point principles. Not a comprehensive text on Hapkido by any means, but a very good start."
5,Excellent Supplement,"This is a great instructional book and I highly recommend it to anyone who is either thinking of starting Hapkido classes, who is a beginner in Hapkido, or even a more experienced practitioner who needs a little refresher or some out of class practice. As others have said, this books is best used when accompanied by classes in a Dojang with an instructor. There are some great pictures and instructions, however, they're are some things that are just too complex to show in the book such as the fine details of hand placement and footwork.I highly recommend this book"
1,Uninspired.........,"Williamson's first book, ""East Bay Grease,"" featured a messy, incomprehensible plot. Two-Up is slightly better, but it comes off as boring and uninspired. The author's attempt to bring the working class to life falls considerably short. If you're looking for true working-class literature, read Dagoberto Gilb, Richard Lange, or Chris Offut. Those writers speak with genuine voices."
4,Smooth Ballads from a Jazz Diva,"I have studied and followed female jazz vocalists for 50 years, including numerous performances of Sarah Vaughn, Nancy Wilson, Betty Carter, and many others, and I have not heard another with more power, improvisational skill, or professional depth than Ranee Lee.This album is a collection of smooth ballads suitable after dinner with the lights low. It is not for everyone, but, if you can listen to Early Autumn, for example, without a thrill, I can't help you.For other jazz styles by Renee, see Dark Divas or I Thought About You, for example. She soars, she croons, she scats, she swings, she does it all. Her work on Round Midnight is as fine as you might ever hear. She is what the wonderful Sarah Vaughn might have been in this age when vocalists receive serious training."
2,Disappointed fan.,"I am a BIG Neil Young fan. I will buy a new Neil Young album without previously hearing a note of it, so it hurts me to say that I found this album painfully uninspiring, dull, and lacking in energy. I'm glad I've got so many other Neil Young albums to listen to until his next new album."
4,Grows on you...,"By now if you're reading this you've heard the comparisons to Harvest, and After the Gold Rush. You've heard the praise, and you've heard the scorn. So I'll try for a fresh angle...It's almost a great cd folks. Almost. The song ""Daddy Went Walkin"" is nearly note for note the song about Old King the dog on Harvest Moon, and it hurts the song's sweet message considerably. The lame lyrical line ""My software's not compatible with you"" sounds woefully out of place with the cd's rustic tone, and ruins the song ""Without Rings"" for me. In addition to that, this is just about the most melancholy music I've ever heard in my life. That said, if you're a Neil Young listener, this is a MUST-OWN cd. It contains a bounty of beautiful, magical music from a great musician. --Just for goodness sake, don't put it on when you're feeling really depressed-it just might finish you off!"
5,NEIL,I think this is one of the better albums Neil has released in quite some time. He goes back to his bluegrass/country roots in his guitar playing and his singing is just getting better and better. This album is a true sign of his emotions.
4,A tunnel of light...,"""Good to see you"" and your guitar again, Neil. I only left out one star for your melancholy self-inspection (i.e., ""Daddy Went Walkin'"") but a ""Distant Camera"" showed me a ""Silver & Gold"" ""Red Sun"" that cut me through with a ""Razor Love"". For those who know Neil well this is some new stuff that will give you goose bumps it sounds so much like the old. (The DVD Silver & Gold is also fabulously for hardcore fans).Get to know Neil- everyone should.Belladonna333"
4,Oh so quiet...,"I like Neil's quiet stuff... I'd get Harvest Moon first, but this is a keeper. It's so quiet I'm not even sure I heard the whole thing..."
5,"An understated, powerful cd","Distant Camera, Dusty Springfield Again and Silver & Gold move me in a way a lot of overproduced, gorgeoulsy orchastrated cds do not. I am not a die hard fan of Neil Young. I only own a handful of his work,but this one really stands out for me. The introspection, the maturity and the simplicity in his delivery has a very real power. It amazes me that so many fans don't like this cd or find the songs to be ""not very good""but I respectfully disagree."
4,What's better than silver and gold?,"After an awful output of material on his last C.D. w/ crazy horse ""broken arrow"", Neil puts out a surprising mellow, extremely laid back set of songs( some songs written way back in '83)called ""Silver and Gold"". Neil is no longer the rebel/rock&roll/folky that he was famous of being, nor is he the Godfather of grunge that the media has labeled him in the 90's, but he is an aging family man who has one hell of a job. It's an album of simplicity, acoustic guitars, soft percussion, random piano, and whispered vocals. stand-out songs include title track, razor love, Buffalo springfield again, and without rings. The first listen didn't impress me much but by the third time through i was blaring it through my cars speakers so the whole town ( or whoever was in listening distance) could enjoy. If you expecting a masterpiece then you'd be very disappointed, if you expect something that's ""real"" from an artist whose been there done that, then give it a try."
3,"If ""Harvest Moon"" was the sequel to ""Harvest""...","...then this album is the sequel to ""Comes a Time"". Like that album, this one is filled with well-played well-written but not particularly memorable music. Maybe some of it will grow on me as time goes on the way stuff from ""Comes a Time"" did, but Young doesn't usually work that way with me. His stuff, be it the pastoral Neil or the ""grunge senior"" Neil, grabs me at first listen. None of this material does, unfortunately. Plus, this album breaks a string of hourlong albums at its vinyl LP length of about 40 minutes. Could that mean his creative well is running dry? I sure hope not--I've spent half my life convincing people that this dude with the whiny voice and mediocre guitar playing is really a superlative musician. I'd like to keep on doing so."
2,The spark isn't there,"I loved Harvest & Harvest Moon. Bought Neil's new CD with the hope of more of these type of projects. Not a lot of new ""old"" guys out there. It is a flat CD because there are not strong melody's or exciting musical points here. It's sort of like he picked up his guitar and sang some melody's with some good lyrics. I like Neil's work, but this CD just doesn't get off the ground. After The Gold Rush is really his best!"
5,Overlooked Masterpiece,"I hold thos album in very high regard. It's a very beautiful acoustic album with a real range of sounds (country, celtic, folky, softer rock).I like it better than Harvest Moon. It really has a nice gentle mood and some excellent guitar/lyrics."
4,"TOO SHORT, BUT WHAT'S THERE.....","I AM A HUGE NEIL YOUNG FAN AND HIS NEW DISC IS SIMPLY AWESOME. VERY MELLOW AND ACTUALLY PRETTY MUSIC ESPECIALLY COMING FROM A MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO ROCK VERY LOUD WITH DISTORTION. THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS DISC IS THAT IT IS ONLY APPROXIMATELY 39 MINUTES LONG. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? NEIL NORMALLY DELIVERS NOT ONLY QUALITY, BUT QUANTITY WITH HIS RELEASES, BUT THIS DISC IS SHORT EVEN BY 1970'S STANDARDS. WITH THAT SAID, EVERY SONG IS GREAT AND TO SINGLE ONE OUT AS BEING THE BEST IS TOUGH, BUT IF I HAD TO, IT SO HAPPENS TO BE THE LONGEST SONG, ""RAZOR LOVE."" TO SUMMARIZE GREAT DISC BUT TOO SHORT."
2,More Silver & Gold For NY's Coffers,"A typically effortless NY offering (and lapped up by the undiscerning public of course), saved only by the last 4 tracks. Buy ""Harvest"" instead."
2,Pleasant but Forgettable,"This is a very mellow album by Young which features some nice vocals and guitar work in generally minimalist arrangements. In sound, it's somewhat reminiscent of ""Harvest Moon"", which I thought was easily superior.The problem here is simply that the songs aren't very good. All are originals, some have been played in his stage shows for years without going on to CD, but I didn't find even one to be moving or memorable. This is a bland recording by an artist who has done far better; I would recommend it only for hardcore Young fans."
2,Neil is just too happy.,"I receive each new Neil Young issue with great anticipation and am almost never disappointed, until now that is. Where is the acerbic wit, the energy, the creative genius that has characterized his great body of work to date? It just isn't there. Sorry to all you fans, I too am one. But I have to say it like it is. Neil is just too happy. I am happy for you, Neil. It is the rest of us, your adoring fans, who suffer and now must wait until a little crisis enters your life. Not that I am wishing you ill. If mediocrity is the price we must pay for a little happiness and contentment in life, so be it. You deserve it. You have given us so very much. It is okay to be happy. Just don't try and sing about it, okay?"
1,Disc skipped,"The disc skipped it couldn't play. Additionally, the item was in a clear plastic CD case with no album cover pictures or album art."
2,I want my OLD Neil Young,"No one loves Neil more than I do -- Comes a Time is the reason I became a songwriter. There was a time when Neil challenged his listeners, but there's none of that on Silver and Gold. No challenge, no edge, no inspiration. And this is the same guy that gave us Tonight's the Night, for god's sake! Oh, those were the days. It's obvious he's been hanging around with rock's Holy Trinity of Mediocrity (CS&N) lately and it's rubbed off. If you're looking for a musical challenge, try Dan Bern -- you won't find it here."
1,Neil on heavy medication,"I'm a big fan of Neil Young when he is on a roll, but he has put out some lousy material over the years. This CD was almost physically painful for me to listen to. It didn't sound like he had anything to say, so he spent forty minutes not saying anything. I liked Comes A Time and parts of Harvest Moon, but this just struck me as a very lazy effort. I also object to new CD's being this short in duration. I realize that great music and length don't necessarily go together, but anything less than fifty minutes just seems like a rip-off given the price of CD's these days. I guess Neil couldn't stay awake long enough to go any further."
1,Boring,"Absolutely nothing on this CD caught my ear. I'm a Neil Young fan, but this sounds so quiet and generic I might as well be in an elevator."
1,ho hum.......,This album presents a shadow of the Niel Young I have listened to for years. The lyrics feel contrived and pointless. Save your money. I wish I had.
4,the art of artlessness,"The tunes seem plain. The lyrics are plain except for the howlers ('my software's not compatible with you'). The ideas seem miniature like a soothing James Taylor record. His voice reaches for surprisingly high notes, never with much strength. That's the first impression; a couple more listens later I'm asking myself why I keep playing it. Either Neil's a habit or this is a pretty strong effort, about what you'd expect after his longest ever layoff. I guess it's the sincerity of it all that's winning and disarming. I still think 'Razor Love' is a weak song and 'Buffalo Springfield Again' is dull. Everything else on the record is rock solid. As always Neil follows his muse wherever she leads. This time she's going home and home is pretty inviting. I wish that Emmylou Harris had sung more of the high notes and that co-producer Ben Keith was given some more bars for his splendid pedal steel."
4,Very Contemplative,"There are few musicians who've been around since the peak years of Rock and are still making excellent music. Bowie, Springsteen, and Young all prove their brilliance while the Phil Collins's and Elton John's of the world sell out. Here is Neil's best album since Mirrorball and his most personal since Harvest Moon. This album, oddly, reminds me in many ways of Ghost of Tom Joad, Springsteens own languid journey into his heart. I love it."
3,Silver and Gold . . . Rusted?,"I admit, the naughty Neil strikes my ears, I appreciate when he mixes his sounds in his albums, the easy listenings with the rebel tunes. He does this well in his ""Harvest"" album. But listening to this just reminds me that Neil is getting old. Buy ""Silver and Gold"" if you are in a stage of life to get all sentimental. ""Good to See You"" is definetley a solid song -- it is short, striking, I can continually listen to it, and the song deserves a spot on a movie soundtrack. ""Razor Love"" is another powerful song;it makes me a little teary-eyed. I have always felt that Neil was a man to listen to if you wanted to relate to someone, share emotions and all. Buy this CD if you feel the repose coming in your life, Neil Young will settle you down with this one. It is silver, but the gold is not polished- you'll have to rub it for a while."
3,so so,"Neil Young has been one of my favorite artists since his Buffalo Springfield and Crazy Horse days. A lot of people have been raving about this CD, yet I find it just so so. Most of the songs sound like they were ones that didn't make the cut of Harvest. There are a couple that I really like but most sound so familiar and recycled -- like I'd heard better versions 15 years ago. Neil's sound is timeless, and that's not always such a good thing. I like to hear an artist progress too."
4,country dog reformation,"The reformation of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young seems to have sparked life into the old country dog yet again. Silver and Gold sees Young's return to the countrified barn-dance ethics of superior releases such as After the Goldrush (1970) and Harvest (1972). Off-centre autumn lullabies echo through the set list on sublime pieces like Buffalo Springfield Again and Daddy went walkin', and throughout one feels Young and his creaky ensemble wallow in the joys of quirky country choruses and basal whines. Whether the timeless quality and sharp social insight of old will hold true on this Neil Young release remains to be seen. But certainly this is as lofty and exquisite a Neil Young as we may ever see again and without doubt benchmarks a most stately homecoming."
3,eh...,"Neil Young is no doubt a very strong, consistant and prolific songwriter. ""Silver and Gold"" is a decent album but is often annoying in my opinion. The title track is particularly strong and intimate, as is ""Razor Love"". Most of the other songs are largely unlistenable. Now, I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea, I think Neil is great and has made incredible albums, but I really don't see why this album is all that special. He's capable of so much more..."
2,Nothing New Under the 'Young',"There really is nothing new here from good ol' Neil. Just more of the same harvest, with sappier songs which, I believe, didn't require much effort on his part to pen. Do yourself a favor and buy the debut disc from the Beachwood Sparks. You'll thank me for it."
2,writer's block?,"Compared to similar albums (Harvest, Harvest Moon and Comes a time) this is easily the least inspired. After a string of beautiful albums starting after his work on American Dream in 1988 with Freedom up to 1994's Sleeps with angels Neil Young in my opinion suffered some serious writier's block. Not essential and not very rewarding i.m.o."
2,Harvest Moon it ain't...,"Okay, what a boring record this is! And given how good Neil's work with country-folk can get, that's not good at all. Several songs (""Good to See You""; ""Daddy Went Walkin'""; ""Red Sun"") sound like campfire singalongs. You know, the kind of things most people cut from their albums, and leave in the vaults until they put out an odds-and-sods album: he also embarrasses himself with the nauseating ""Buffalo Springfield Again"", a tribute to his old '60s group. Another song with embarrassing lyrics is ""Distant Camera"", a metaphor about life being a photograph. Entertainment here sadly comes in bits and pieces, unlike Harvest, Harvest Moon or Prairie Wind: the simple beauty of ""Horseshoe Man""; the modest, unpretentious title track and ""The Great Divide"". When you take everything into account, though, this is clearly one of Young's lesser albums."
4,a low key masterpiece sure to be underappreciated,"This CD was envisioned as a solo acoustic project at its inception three years ago. The final version (version 3.0 I might add) features a band but retains a quietness that showcases a relaxed and seemingly content Neil Young. The song sequence of ""Silver and Gold"" is geared for a record, you know vinyl, LPs? The first four songs are gentle musings on life, love and time past. The understated start is reminiscent of Young's 1978 release ""Comes a Time."" The ""B-side "" of the CD starts with ""The Great Divide"" and immediately changes the timbre and intensity of the album. In the last five songs Young's voice seems to demand more attention. In classic Young fashion the CD closes with a curve ball in the moody ""Without Rings."" Young sings in a flat and somber style that brings out the dark overtones of the song perfectly."
5,Better than Silver and Gold,"Neil Young has crafted a lovely batch of tunes that are quite addictive. Simple, extremely well-performed and achingly personal, it got the immediate attention of my fourteen year-old son who usually balks at anything I bring home. Musically, this collection brings on smile after smile. Lyrically, there is only one stumble ('my software's not compatible with you') on 'Without Rings', but, ironically, Neil slips in a wonderful turn of phrase on the very next verse(you'll have to get the CD)!"
5,Neil strikes Gold again.,"Young continues to get better with age. the ten songs on Silver and Gold can stand with any of the 300 or so songs he's released throughout his entire career. A beautiful record-take 40 minutes into this world and you'll feel moved. The last two songs on the disc,Razor Love and Without Rings are standouts for me. Anybody who liked Harvest,After the Goldrush,Comes a time and Harvest Moon will like this record. Another GREAT one from one of the Greats!"
5,Close to Perfect,"This is a beautiful peice of work. Every song is honest, introspective and delivered with a purity that only Neil Young can reproduce. Neil is wearing his heart on his sleave and sounds great. Lyrics and music are both fabulous.Buy this, you wont be disappointed."
2,lo maloo y lo buenoo,lo unico que no me gusto que se ve como nuevo pero hay escenas que no puedo ver es lo que unico malo de esto :S si no fuera por que la compre solo por Lorena Rojas hace rato lo botaria ya...
5,Great!!! Nice sound and functionality for the money.,Just got the iLuv i7500WHT Mini Stereo from JWin Electronics. It was all plug-and-play out of the box. Sounds great! I hooked it up in our breakfast area and the sound is rich and solid. Docking station charges iPod and remote control not only controls volume but also controls track advance forward and backward on iPod. This is a great feature! All-in-all very happy with product. Delivery was prompt and packaging good.
1,Bad Side Effects,"I had lab tests done by NeuroScience after which they and my doctor recommended Travacor before bedtime (as well as 2 other products). The first night I tried it was awful - very little sleep, and what i did get was filled with stressful dreams. I felt awful the next day. I tried it a second night, but added melatonin (which I've used successfully in the past) and a calcium-magnesium supplement. I managed to get to sleep that night, but still felt my heart racing. Woke up with churning thoughts and in such a bad mood that I couldn't stand to be around myself. My kids were grateful to leave for school to get away from me that morning. By mid-afternoon the effect wore off and I could function again. I now have an expensive bottle of pills that I don't dare take."
5,it works,2 winters ago I had a horrible bout of insomnia which affected me to the core. I tried various over the counter and prescription sleep aids and nothing worked. I would fall asleep usually but wake up only a few hours later thinking about various issues. I exercise daily and even boosting that did not help. A freind recommended Travacor and within a week of starting it my sleep issues went away. I have not had a issue now for almost 2 years and feel so much better. I have not had to take any other sleep aids since starting Travacor.
3,Love Haribo... but not these,"I love Haribo gummi candy... gold bears, fizzy colas, happy colas, plain strawberries. However, these (which I hoped would be like the plain strawberries but with the added cream flavor) are way too sugary sweet. The ""dusting"" of sugar is more like a gumdrop coating of sugar and takes away from the Haribo gummi texture that I love. My family liked them okay (not as much as other gummi candies, but much more than I liked them)."
3,too sweet and softer than regular gummies,The flavor of this product is okay but they are just too sweet. The texture is more like a firm gumdrop rather than a traditional gummi candy. Trolli sells a version of this that is a little more fruity/flavorful so it doesn't come off as being so sweet. They were just okay and I wouldn't buy them again.
3,pretty sweet ...,"Sure, a candy is supposed to be sweet but Haribo very often understands to find that fine line between great sweet treat and too sweet. These are very sugary with the added sugar coating. The candies are softer and easier to chew than the usual gummy bears or happy colas which makes it easy to gulp down a whole bag in no time - even if the first few bites make your tounge stick ;-)The German strawberry version ""Primavera"" is a very different kind of candy - be careful not to confuse these two (like I did ...).To give you an idea where my Haribo taste buds come from: love Happy Cola, Fizzy Cola, Haribo Confect and several other Haribo candy that, unfortunately, are not available in the US."
1,JUNK!,This brand is chockful of artificial colors and junk. Shame on this company for putting this crap in their candy. I ordered 2 bags and when they got here and I read the ingredients I wouldn't even eat them. This stuff isn't fit for consumption. There should be an option for putting ZERO stars!!!
3,be careful when ordering pumps????,"When ordering this pump the Amazon said it was the right one for a '92 dodge van 6.Half the auto stores say it was right,half said it was the 49,of course now you have a chance that they are right or Amazon is,so I went with this ne it only fits one model for that year I think.Anyway dropped the tank and only to find out it was the wrong one.Amazon made it right but had to argue the point and had a dead truck in the drive waiting for the other right pump for my truck."
5,Have fun while you learn how to cope with your anger!,"Are you a parent? Do you commute through obnoxious traffic? Does your mate do inexplicably irritating things on a daily basis? Pick up this fun book and realize that you're not alone AND that there are many positive ways to respond to the inevitable challenges to your daily equilibrium. A great read that's full of insight, humor, and ideas that require some work to implement, but then you can't expect to deal with this subject without some work on your part!"
1,Glad this book was free...,"I received a review copy of this book, and have to say - the authors must've thought they were writing to a young child. While the content of the book does flow nicely, it is also strikingly simplistic and juvenile. Redundancy permeates like bad perfume, and the illustrations are inconsistent and drab.The concept of the book seems average and overdone. You're better off spending $4 to rent ""Anger Management"" starring Jack Nicholson. However, if you're looking for a good book on overcoming and dealing with anger, I recommend ""Anger"" by Thich Nhat Hanh. Unlike Middleton-Moz's book, ""Anger"" is intelligent writing geared towards people over the age of 12."
1,Not very satisfied,"Every time I power it on, it has to search for satelites and takes a lot of time to get its bearing. Not too amazed by this product."
1,WARNING,"I don't have a clue how this item works - I just took it out of the box. What I can tell you is that it does NOT accept a cigarette lighter adapter, as one might conclude it would, given that Amazon and other dealers include a cigarette adapter as an accessory."
2,Good for a beginner but might dump your memory,"A few months in use and my 200 started to dump memory at random intervals. This meant that each time I powered on, it was a gamble as to if my coordinates were still entered. This is very frustrating when I go on a trip, I always have to make sure I have a paper back up source of my information. If you get a 200 that works then I would recommend the unit for beginners but I don't know how common this problem is."
3,Portable GPS,I never seriously used mine since I don't go off in no mans land looking to get lost. I will say this wasnt user friendly to use and doesn't contain any graphics. But if you wanted to track where you started and get back to it this would do the job I guess. Like I said I dont go looking to get lost so I couldn't test the GPS in god forsaken places. I sold it as it was a gift that went along with another purchase.
3,Magellan Explorist 200,"Nice things about the explorist is it's cheap, ruggedly simple, good screen resolution, nice hand fit, good satellite fix and much better than Garmin's old chips'fitted gps. Great for outdoor adventure.Downside is, low resolution track logging. Can't beat Garmin's Etrex features."
2,Probably not worth your money.,"I already have a Magellan Sportrak and I'm perfectly happy with it. I just needed something with roadmaps. So when Magellan came out with the eXplorist 200, I said ok, and bought it. It got here today. I installed the batteries, turned it on and started driving. I was immediately dissapointed. The detail of the mapping of this unit is horrendous. It's as if they randomly picked streets they thought would be good to put in the device. It's almost funny how few streets this thing shows in my area. Now you're probably thinking I live in some backwoods place that this thing won't map. I live in Charleston, SC. One of the largest cities in SC. I'd say this thing shows less than .5% of the streets here. I bought a Garmin eMap well over 5 yrs ago that had a million times more detail than this thing. Save your money and get something with better mapping capability if that's what you're looking for."
4,Great for hiking,This GPS has gotten me out of the woods more than once in the dark. By setting waypoints on the unit 4 of us were able to get back down off North Dome in Yosemite in the dark and find our way back to the car. For the price this unit does plenty to get you out of trouble and as an avid photographer i use it on every trip. Like the old American Express add never leave home without it!
5,It does the job.,"I use the GPS unit for when I go out geocaching and it works great. The map detail is so much better compared to the 100 version, and I haven't noticed anything really lacking when compared to the 300 version. I've used it at my school to teach an after school geocaching program, and so far it has survived multiple encounters with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd graders."
5,GPS 2,"This is my second GPS and it was very easy to get use to and now I have started comparing this Magellan to my Garmin, and in many ways the Magellan is better."
2,Crash Test Dummy,"In Dec 04 received one as a present. In June 05 it started shutting off on its own and then stopped turning on all together. Lost a weeks worth of sailing and diving in the Bahamas. Returned it to the store, bought a new one. It was handy and familiar thought I would give it another try. Since then it has dumped my saved Points of Interest THREE times. Now the other day it crashed and defaulted to to a screen called ""Burn In Test"". Fortunately it did this after I copied off my latest Points of Interest. Now I have a Garmin eTrek Legend."
3,No PC Connection,"The major drawback of this model is that it CANNOT be connected to a PC. My primary application of a GPS is to hook it up with my laptop with Microsoft Street and trips running. Therefore, I would recommend a Garin model at similar price which Does come with a PC cable."
4,"Florsheim Men's Brady Slip-on, Black","I have had some problems with my feet in the past and it is hard for me to find comfortable shoes that fit well and are comfortable. I also have almost completely flat feet. I have had a brown pair for about one year that I purchased at a local shoe store and wear them regularly. The black pair I purchased from Amazon.com were about $30 cheaper than the shoe store.The shoe has very good arch support and a very cushioned yet supportive insole and a rubbery softer outsole. These are the most comfortable shoes I own. I would prefer the style to be a little more dressy for work with the same comfort. I would rate them a five, but I believe there is always room for improvement."
5,great pair of shoes,"very comfy and my wife commented that it looks good compared to my ""combat shoes"" like shoe collection.she loves the look, i love the comfort and looks.Amazon is always a great store to deal with so whats there not to like?"
2,Comfy but not durable,"While I enjoyed the comfort of the materials on the sides of the shoe, this shoe feels more like a slipper than a shoe. The botton has almost no support, flexing for comfort but providing very little support. While I enjoyed wearing them, sadly they fell apart before the sole even started to wear. It started with a whole between the right heel and the base of the shoe, which eventually expanded to lift the whole shoe off of the back. And, this happened after I took care to use a shoe horn each time I put the shoes on in the morning. I'm not sure I will purchase another pair of Florsheim shoes."
5,"Rich with detail, exciting adventures and characters","Mr. Brooks has captured all the rich details in this epic account of the Royal Navy and its intrepid sailors and marines. Each section is filled with some amazing tales of courage and clever practices in warfare.The book is very readable but not for the novice Victorian era reader. There are a great number of terms that many may not understand, but the style of writing allows the reader to follow the various conflicts and the daring sailors as they endure horrible climates, savage battles, disease and some very hostile tribesmen around the globe.The tactics, personnel, weapons and commanders are laid out making the book very well rounded. I wish the book had been twice the size and hated to see the book end. The author should be commended for fleshing out a little known aspect of the Victorian time period. Check it out"
2,Ben E. KIng,"Even though I read all the previous reviews, and had considered NOT buying this DVD, in a weak moment I bought it. And I am SORRY I did. Ben E. KIng just doesnt have it anymore as a singer. That once tremendous, wonderful voice is NOT there anymore!! Save your money!! Dont buy it!!!"
1,"Technical quality: 10, Soul: 0","Very nicely recorded in 5.1 surround sound. Excellent musicianship. Very poor arragements. Absolutely soul-less. Those looking for hot versions of earlier hits, please look elsewhere. There is nothing here that justifies purchasing this disk. Nothing."
1,Past his Prime,"A great collection of songs, to bad he can't sing anymore. His voice cracks anytime he is expected to carry a note. Check out the B.B. King instead, it's GREAT!"
5,Amazing,first I'd just like to say that the word gratitude is spelled correctly on my cd (in all places I could find the word)I just bought this cd and it is amazing... eli is also a very amazing person. I met him and he talked at my school for 3 days. he is such an amazing and deathly truthful speaker and his music is just as truthful and amazing.
3,Kings & Queens Of Country,"Just as an idea if they ever make another edition of this, with it being called Kings & Queens of Country - King of the Road by Roger Miller happens to have a follow-up song/companion song called Queen of the House by Jody Miller (his wife), and it would be fitting on such an album.Besides that, it seems like a fun album for people to enjoy."
5,Power Metal from the Swedes,"This is, IMO, HammerFall's best album. The riffs are as big and melodic as the vocal lines and choruses. This is safe, competently played 1980's influenced traditional metal. All the songs here are decent, and Joacim Cans vocals are smooth and powerful, as well as some tasty riffery from Oscar Dronjak being served along side them. They even do Warlord some justice with their ""Child of the Damned"" cover. In all honesty, you can by this and pretty much skip the rest of their discography, as HammerFall have not been able to produce and album to even come close in the ensuing years."
5,"All hail, true metal is back!","Currently there seems to be an 'eighty- metal' revival going on, but one band who really stands out is Hammerfall. Obviously influenced by the old Helloween- stuff, their songs really give an 'old' approach to modern metal. Some of the most wonderful guitar-riffs ever leave you reminiscing about the good old days of 'sex, drinks, and metal'!"
2,I think I've seen this movie before....,"Well...if you are a nostalgic of the old days of heavy metal...better go and buy yourself a Judas Priest album.This album sounds pretty much like that,with the only difference that Joacim is not the half of what Rob Halford used to be in Judas Priest.Y'know,everything changes,and evolutions,but I think that this guys don't know that,or just don't care.I think that this band came out late about...15 years,at least.Legacy of Kings?No,thanx.My money can be better spent in some other worthy albums."
2,Generic Power Metal,"2 stars at best! I really disliked this album for many good reasons. To name a few: 1. It sounds like any other modern power metal band. 2. It's terribly cheesy. 3. The songs are written poorly. If you want to hear a really bad song, listen to STONECOLD! That's garbage"
4,Found to be nice for my k-5 blazer,Much nicer than any store bought seat cover from the auto stores.the k-5 stock seats have a square back ( stock seats )these fit real nice compared to others that i purchased before and returned.i loved the look and texture of these ! My truck is going black and maroon in color inside and out.Very happy/ QUICK ship.great if you can't afford to put in new interior right away.
4,I need another larger pair!!!!,They are greatly sized.. They are a little heavy ( I have small ears) but a great piece of jewelry. They actually came ahead of time. They look in person as they do in the picture. They were worth the price.Whirlbefree
1,Horrible,"looks cheap, the base is HORRIBLE! its barely holding on to the roof top of my vehicle. the cord is not 10ft, its 2 ft maybe even less!! it stops working if you touch the cord! Im not happy with the product! the owner LIED on his post!! but when you really think about it it was 12$.. i mean what did i expect.."
5,With focus on evolving Native politics and interactions,"Part of the University of Nebraska Press ""History of the American West"" series, One Vast Winter Count: The Native American West Before Lewis And Clark by Colin Calloway is not just another casual or coffee table treatment, but a weighty and in-depth examination of the Native American west before Lewis and Clark, highly recommended for college-level holdings and the personal reading lists of Native American History students and dedicated American West history buffs. Over 600 pages traces the histories of the Native American peoples of the west from their arrival thousands of years ago to the early years of the 19th century. The focus on evolving Native politics and interactions with various cultures and the new look blending ethnohistory and frontier history makes One Vast Winter Count a unique and strongly recommended presentation."
2,"Basic information, poor organization, useless index","This book is a descent resource of basic information; that is, if you can find it. That's the most frustrating thing about this book is that it suffers from poor organization and a horrible index that follows it's own inexplicable logic.E-mail links? No listing in the index. Same for such basic terms as: pop-up windows, navigation, browser windows, publishing, windows, importing, and printing. It was easier and less frustrating to flip through the entire book than to try to figure out the logic of the index.If you chance on some information that you may need, put a placeholder or a stickynote there immediately; you may never find it again."
1,For absolute novices only,"I usualy rely on the Visual Quickstart guides to get me ""up and running"" on software I'm unfamiliar with because they start out slowly with brief introductions to the programmes' interface and move quickly onward. In this guide the first 240 pages are basically useless unless you've never used any image editing or illustration software before (or possibly ever used a computer). This would normally make it ideal for novices, but frankly, most will be disapointed with what little they will actually be able to do with the software after digesting the whole book. If you are considering buying this book don't do so unless you plan to purchase the corresponding ""Quickpro"" guide as well. If you have any experience with Illustrator, Freehand, Director, or even Non-Linear editing packages you shouldn't bother with this one at all."
2,Full of errors,"This book is so full of errors or that they forgot to include crucial information in the examples that it's not funny. Right now I'm working with ""controlling text-field scrolling,"" page 431, and the whole step by step tutorial doesn't work. What's worse, when you type the actionscript in the actionscript window in export mode as seen in the book, the syntax is full of mistakes. The program says the syntax doesn't work. So, they publish code that doesn't even work in Flash MX. What the hell is wrong here? And I've encountered several other mistakes in this book, which, in the end, is almost worthless. Don't buy."
3,This is not a various artist CD,"This is not a compilation of Various Artists as stated above. All songs are performed by The Countdown Kids. It says Ages 3-10, lyrics included."
3,I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas,I was looking for the version sung by Gayla Peevy. Ended up giving it as a gift to the nephews.
4,I want a hippopotamus for Christmas,"I have not listened to the whole album, but this is the cutest song I've heard in a long time."
4,Super Cute!,Great product. Received product as exactly shown and received it promptly. Made a great gift.
2,Can't recommend to fellow longhorn,"There's not too much us Longhorns won't buy when it comes to swag, but this is smaller than expected. Even my wife, not a longhorn, was surprised at how small it is. Yes, I know there's no false or misleading advertising as it's duly noted that it's about a foot. In our case, street curb to gnome is about 35ft, and frankly, you can't see it.The product itself is a ceramic based, and that comes into play when you're trying to secure it from potential thieves (12yo neighbor boy and his posse). I tried to put a eyelet screw in the gnome's heel which would then be tethered to a chain and stake in the ground. No luck. Gnome's now close to heelless now, as the screw cracked it. Instead, I took the chain and encircled his ankles. Still a deterrent, but less than ideal.Otherwise, is it really burnt orange, not some orange that's close? Yes. Is the longhorn logo on the cap visible from more than 5-6ft away? Barely"
2,Everything was great except for the logo on the hat,"I have to give this product only 2 stars because while I was happy with the Gnome itself (the smaller than expected size was actually perfect for me), the longhorns logo on the hat was pretty badly mangled. The horns for some reason stick directly horizontal out of the head as opposed to being nicely curved. This was going to be a great gift for a friend but now I'm reconsidering even giving it to them because the logo is almost unrecognizeable to the point of making this product look incredibly cheap and poorly manufactured. Just an unlucky recipient I suppose."
4,Lennon-eatlesesque,"I'd say they have more of a pronounced John Lennon influence-even more than Beatles sound, although you can't really separate the two. Just discovered them today via Pandora on my Radar Bros playlist."
4,Anyone else confused...?,"Ok, so far the book is good, (I'm not done yet but...) I just finished reading Fletch Won and Fletch Too, as I like to read in chronological order of the character/story events. In Fletch Won and Fletch Too, Irwin is engaged and subsequently married to Barbara. So I'm confused as to who this Linda he is divorced and not paying alimony too in Fletch and the Widow Bradley. I know this isn't really a review as much as it is my curiosity getting the better of me. Anyone know the answer? As for Fletch and the Widow Bradley, the diolague is great and the story is pretty fast-paced. There is definately enough going on to keep the reader interested."
5,"KRAFTWERK , IS GUT","I love Kraftwerk, this is just one more totally wonderful and impeccably made album, I highly recommend ALL of thier albums (except maybe Electric Cafe, which is slightly chinzy) Anyways, yes. DOCTRESS JULIA"
5,"If you could only buy one book, this would be it...","Excellent. Paul Conte and Mike Otey are well known in the Midrange AS/400 world for their concise, no-nonsense approach to programming the AS/400 in a variety of languages(i.e. C, RPG, SQL/400, etc.). Here, in the SQL Server world, starting with ""SQL Server 7 Developer's Guide"", and now for SQL Server 2000, they apply the same style and manner and succeed admirably. The book is chock-full of examples, and performance tips, and even includes a SQL primer! They leave no stone unturned, and cover every aspect of SQL DDL, DML, and T-SQL. Lastly, their coverage of OLEDB/ADO and XML completes the picture. As I said, if you could only buy one book on SQL Server 2000, this is the one to buy!"
3,SQL Server Developer's Guilde....NOT,"The book title is some what misleading since there is a lot of coverage on front end developement. When I purchased this book I was expecting a strictly SQL Server Developer book, not a visual basic programmers reference, it also through me off when I discovered 4 chapters dedicated just to SQL Server Administration. If you want a jack of all trades book then this book might help, but it is certainly not just strictly for SQL Server development only which is what I was looking for."
3,For Experienced Programmers,"First of all, let me say that this book is not meant for End-Users, Administrators or Analysts. It is strictly for Developers and Programmers and does not cover the SQL Server 2000's interface, nor its various tools.This book does contains an in-depth look at SQL Server programming, including Stored Procedures, Cursors, Triggers and ADO. It covers plenty of programming topics and issues, but does not dive into much detail about certain topics that deserve more attention. Also it lacks examples (specifically data output examples) and screen-shots.Other than that, it is a good book to have, but I would not recommend it to novice programmers. I do however, recommend SQL Server 2000 Programming by Example, which covers a narrower range of topics, but in a lot more detail."
1,Look elsewhere...,"This book is too broad in the subject area that it addresses and ends up lacking in topics where details are important. The amount of disparate bits and pieces gives the book a messy and shallow feeling. How this book attracted 5 stars from other reviewers baffles me. Don't be fooled by the thickness of the book. Most ""jack of all trade"" books are thick and useless. Try ""SQL Server 2000 Programming by Example"" by Guerrero and Rojas for a more focused text."
1,BEWARE: this DVD contains almost no drumming.,"When I saw the cover of this DVD and read the Editorial Review here on amazon.com I immediately pre-ordered the disc. Big mistake. Incrediby, there's almost no drumming on this DVD. It's an amateurish documentary produced by a regional (Niigata) Japanese TV station that offers nothing more than disjointed behind-the-scenes glimpses of the group's ""One Earth Tour."" The deceptive packaging is a disservice to both the group Kodo and its fans."
1,Huge Disappointment,"As the previous reviewer suggests, there's nothing here for a Kodo fan looking for a performance video. There's little here of any interest at all -- I doubt that any of the music snippets last more than 20 seconds. Well worth avoiding."
5,Sublime,"Elegant, emotive, and awe-inspiring. Masaaki Suzuki's genius lies in his remarkable sensitivity to the expressive possibilities inherent in each phrase, harmonic shift, and rhythmic nugget, as he effortlessly glides from one delicious cadence to the next. Every minute of this recording is magical. Pure bliss. Buy it."
3,pretty cool,"although this recording is not bad, i rarely pull it out and listen to. Mops were a japanese hard rock band with a few leanings towards prog rock. but basically they were a popular bluesy rock band that wrote some fairly catchy songs. sounds like most of their influence came from bands like Collosseum or some of the early sounds of British rock like The Yardbirds or The Searchers."
1,Not made like it used to be,We were so excited to find this item because I had been searching for ages to replace the one we had used for years and years manufactured under another name but the cutting blade showed signs of stress and cracking during the first day of use.
5,"excellent product, just what I was looking for",Was exactly what i was looking for. Attached it to the matching head. WOrks perfectly. Ground needs a little breaking before hand.
4,Not bad.,This year the weeds have really taken over so I needed something like this to help me out. I remembered back to my childhood in the 80's that my mom bought this fancy interchangeable garden tool so I jumped online to see if the company was still in business. Well it appears it isn't (even though my mom still uses those tools today and is in her 70's) so I purchase this brand. It works pretty well but it's a little less well made but it has proven to be very tough considering what I've put it through so far.
4,Waking The Day is the definition of MUSIC!,"I bought this cd after a live performance of Marotta & Griesgraber (supporting The Tony Levin Band).The best way to judge the music, is to hear it LIVE!Jerry Marotta & Tom Griesgraber made an album wich is full of ""relaxed energy"".This album can be played in you want to relax, but also if you want to be busy doing whatever.It is a sort of combination of new age music and the inimitable sound of the Chapman Stick guitar.Guest player is (among many): Tony Levin and his very divers style of playing bass.It is a quality recording with high quality musicianship.Buy it!, you will not be dissapointed (if you like real music!).I gave it 4 stars, giving it 5 stars would mean that there can never be anything better made, ever!And however fantastic, there is always room for something new and even better!"
3,RIGHT PRICE,"This is an overall view. It doesn't give you too much information. The good thing is, it gives titles so you can pursue other venues to get to the pieces you're interested in. For instance, I've been looking for the dance sequence of the jitterbuggers. This disc gives me the title so I can try and locate the entire film. Thank you."
5,Good Starter for someone unfamiliar w/ the pioneers,"It's a good overview, for students or foreigners. Someoneneeds to know the pioneers of the culture which has beencopied multiple times, throughout the world."
1,Lacking content,The book is next to useless as a source of information on the mind/thinking of serial killers. The only pages worth reading were of the actual interviews. Mr. Ressler should try not to spend so much time bragging about his importance to the cases and more time on the subject in which he leads us to belive he his writing about. A definite waste of money and time.
2,"INTERESTING, BUT......","The case histories were interesting, but this guy has an ego as big as all outdoors. I also read Douglas's book and can't imagine these two ever working together. They would constantly be in the hospital having their arms set from patting themselves on the back. But I digress! I guess when your work takes you into the world of the serial killer, you deserve alot of credit. Ressler's interviews with Gacy and Dahmer made my skin crawl. Thank God this world doesn't ever have to worry that they might be out walking around again. I didn't read his first book, but I think I'll hold off for awhile before I do."
1,Not worth one second of your time...,"I thought Whoever Fights Monsters was terrible. Amateurishly written, no depth in discussing the subject, and a self aggrandizing attitude on Mr. Ressler's part. I Have Lived In The Monster is all of that...times 100! Worse yet, throughout this book Ressler came across to me as an apologist for these serial killers. A recurring theme is that it's not their fault that they are the way they are, someone made them that way, executing them would be wrong, we need to show them compassion, study them, and figure out how to make their minds right. Ressler's ego trip is far more potent in this book. He aggrandizes himself in barely 200 pages as opposed to his previous outing which took 300 or so. This was written in a very slipshod, sloppy way. I got the impression that maybe he'd just bought a house, boat, etc. and needed a quick influx of cash. I hope it was worth it, because I have an even lower opinion of him than before and I will not buy another one of his books."
2,"an attempt to be ""artsy"" fails. . .","As much as I love Francophone culture, especially Haitian literatue and history, I don't think I could have finished this book if I hadn't been assigned to write a paper on it. Granted, the translation may have been faulty- someday, I plan to read the original. But it seems to be that Clitandre was trying hard (too hard!) to write an ""artistic novel"". The timeline is also very confusing. I hate to admit, I had to read this book five or six times before I even started to understand what was going on. And, as a full time student who works 20 hours a week, I don't have that kind of time!"
2,"Very ""wordy"" ....rather than to the point...","This book is the chosen text for my Psychology of Aggression class. I have taken several Psych courses and used textbooks that were very clear, easily stated and to the point. This author is very ""wordy"" and tries to impress you with his jargon and writing style over the power to educate (I am not impressed.) This book is a teaching tool and should be better formulated and laid out. In this day and age anyone can make respectable power point graphs. The ones in this book are pitiful!Maybe I am more of a visual learner. I like bulleted information, clear concise definitions and materials that are to the point. This book rambles at times...But I have no choice to dive in and try to engage myself in the material."
4,Great fun and helpful as well.,These are really great. They are about the same size or a tad larger then as a softball with the prickly points added on. As a previous reviewer stated I bought these for a child with a sensory issue as well. He has fun rolling them between his hands and against his face. There are hard but not hard enough to harm or cause discomfort. They are bright and colorful. These balls also seem very durable. I am not concerned about them falling apart. My younger two children (ages 2 and 4) love them as much as big brother.The only reason I am rating them 4 starts versus 5 is I would have made them just a hair softer and they seem a tad on the pricey side. Minor quibbles and overall very good toys.
2,More Company Advertisement Than Technical Work,"The title of Rob Valentine's work The Art of Making Armour: a Craftsman's Guide to Creating Authentic Reproductions is a bit misleading. While it does show extensive photographs of the armourer at work, it offers very little substance in the way of techniques and methods. The text, what little there is, gives the reader scant insight to the craft. For example, a section is dedicated to the fact that his armoury produces their own rivets, while this is an interesting tidbit, it has more of a feel of a company ad brochure than an instructional work.Often the photos are not in sequence (for example, early in the work, a breastplate is shown being worked, and then suddenly on the same page photos of a chin piece) and lessen the impact of the work. Instead of teaching, the work tends more to show how his techniques offer the client quality pieces, again giving the reader a sense that this is more of an advertisement than actual scholarly intruction."
1,A Mere Pamphlet,"With all due credit to master armourer Rob Valentine and his work, this isn't ""A Craftsman's Guide to Creating Authentic Armour Reproductions"", as promised in the title. Contrary to the impression I received from the review claiming this to be ""A Formadible Guide to An Almost Lost Art (sic)"", this is the farthest thing from a how-to guide imaginable. It's filled with very nice pictures, yes, but the detail on the ""how to"" is completely non-existent. I was expecting something more informative, much like Jim Hrisoualis's excellent books on bladesmithing. Unfortunately, what you get here is more a large advertising flyer for Valentine Armories (which no longer produces for general purchase), this basically being the ""How we make the armor"" section at the very back. Paying close to $20 for an advertising piece for Valentine's work with the absolute minimum in technique described is kind of annoying, to say the least."
3,Here he is there he's gone,"After purchasing this book and taking the time to find Valentine's shop we were very disappointed. My son was interested in purchasing some armour and we drove all over Calgary looking for his shop. His shop is no longer open to the public and we did not get a private invitation to view his work. We were parked right in front of his home when we phoned which appears to be his shop now. His book may appear to be advertising but don't try and buy his work, he isn't interested.I guess all he wants to do is sell his book."
3,Nice Book,I am a Scenic Designer and found this book to very informative. It gives the basic information for someone getting started in theatre. This book is not for people that are looking for designer profiles and the best designs in concept. It is for beginners breaking down all the info you would need to know about theatre and getting started in Scenic and Lighting Design. The biggest positive for me it that the book contains mostly designs that I haven't seen in any other design books. The designs are from more regional designers as apposed to world renowned designers. It's always nice to have new things to be inspired by.I bought the book used and it was worth it for the new inspiration.
4,Loved It,This was the first time I trusted a site to pick out the music that they believe i would like. 9 Lives was wonderfully surprizing. I would trust the site again to pick for me.
2,Falls flat,"I was expecting so much from the singer of the undeniable song: ""Whine Up"". That song is one of the most catchiest songs of the summer and it never seems to get old.However, upon purchasing this CD I quickly realized that it is just missing so much and it is mediocre at best. There is just too much filler and not enough substance. Her sining is marginal and the beats all tend to blend together and each song somewhat sounds like the previous one. In this industry people get by all the time with a ""thin"" voice but in that case you need to come correct with a strong production team and melodic lyrics to boot. Kat's CD is lacking both. There are a few decent songs but nothing as formulatic and fun as ""Whine Up"".My suggestion would be to sample this CD thoroughly before purchasing to make sure it is your cup of tea.~~~~~~JAC 07'"
4,Good for those who really wants to sue someone,"I am a Japanese and planning a litigation. AMong half a dozen book this I read for the above purpose, this is one of the best.This introduces the legal system and the procedures to make a litigation.Also what striked me is that, despite our impression that American is frenzy for make legal dipution, this book really advise readers to be prudent for the time and cost to file a suite."
5,"The Grace of a ""Music Man""","As erudite and comprehensive a book about the business of making music as we've ever had, by a consummate professional who's been there and done that...ALL of it. The stories of his 'Journey' are a virtual ""Pilgrim's Progress"" for wanna be 'players,' (though far more tasty!). Wit. Elegance. Generosity. I get all of that from these delicious pages. I've long been a fan of the author's consummate musicianship. Now, I'm a fan of his modest, graceful humanity"
5,The best of all!!!,"She does not present herself as a star, but she is on top of it! She was in Montreux in summer 98 and I discovered here there. Precision, rythm, harmony, etc... Nothing is missing. Wish she was my piano teacher too!"
1,Disappointment,"Expected usual throaty version of jazz classics with brilliantly cool instrumental backup, but got instead lengthy piano solos (presumably by Diana Krall) and minimal vocals. Assume this was very early work. Possibly entertaining if in night club, but disappointing in recording."
2,Not a Diana Krall Lover,"If you are not already a fan of Diana Krall, this is a horrible record (yes, and I even remember playing 78's)to start an association. It is essentially the Thunder Bay Jazz quartet with (in extremely small letters) Diana Krall on vocals. And, there are very limited vocals, even in the songs where she actually sings a few words. She appears to be a wonderful Jazz pianist, but, it is not evident from the cover of the album that this is going to be a showcase of her non-vocal skills, and so the number and length of the instrumentals is startling. Virtually all the songs with vocals are up-beat, up-tempo, and in many cases cutesy. So much so, that I began to wonder if some were chosen from an Alvin and the Chipmunks album. Finally, and most damning to me is the fact that she seems to show a vocal range of about half an octave. I cannot believe that anyone praised the range of her vocals in this album because she does not show any."
3,Great intro to DK...,"If you're a fan, it's interesting to go back and here some of her early songs she covered that she still plays at concerts. Tracks ""frim fram sauce"" which honestly I never liked. But there are some good ones on here:straighten up and fly righti'm just a lucky so and so - very good42nd stas long as i livethe others are good to but i really think these tracks make this cd what it is with diversity and range in her early talent. check it out if you're a fan."
4,Unpretentious swing from an upstart performer...,"This offering gives us Diana's first CD, from back around 1992. A mix of instrumentals and vocals, it really does swing. Her voice does not sound much like her 2003-2006 instrument, being a bit rougher around the edges. If you are a fan already, of course you will want it. If you like her more recent stuff, this demonstrates her origins. If you dislike her recent releases, this gives you another facet of a very talented woman. Mainly, this is just fun, and it makes you want to move your lips and your body and sing and dance yourself. (Even if, like me, you can't dance a step or sing a note without screwing it up.)"
4,Fun to go back to the beginning,"I found and bought this CD after collecting the subsequent 4 recordings. I thought it was great fun to go back to the beginning. I love the slightly ""rough"" quality of this CD - I agree it is more playful, the piano tracks have more bounce and with Hamilton/Clayton, they must have had great fun recording this, because that's the quality that comes through. All For You may be my favorite to date however."
3,Great CD - Club Version Not what you Expect,"In regards to this album, I'm simply going to say that it is great, but I love everything Diana sings. I'm really adding this comment because I am disappointed in the ""Club"" version that I bought, expecting there was nothing to lose but paying a few extra dollars to buy it that way - I was wrong! The ""Club"" version turns out to be a ""Manufactured for BMG Direct"" release and it does not include the bonus track ""Sunny Side of the Street"" listed here. I may be wrong, but unless it was hidden somewhere in the fine print, Amazon does not reveal either of these discrepancies when placing an order for the club version and I'm not very happy about it."
2,This needs some work,"For a couple of fellows in a position to do better, one would be surprised to hear why they didn't bother."
3,"History yes, memories no",A great book on the history of the valley. For those of us that grew up in the 60s and 70s this book lacks pictures and stories of that time. If you are looking for memories this book will not bring them back.
5,A Good Book for a new and oldtimer in the Valley,I just moved to the Valley from Dallas a few months ago. I was very curious about the history and the people of the SFV. The book really does a great job about telling the history of the SFV without putting your to sleep. The pictures in the book are very clear and well formatted in the book. I also liked the part of the book were it gives you facts about the time period in the grey boxes. I also showed the book to a women who has lived in the SFV her whole like and she found it very useful. This book is a great coffee table book for someone who lives in the SFV.
4,If only for a smaller format! :-),"For those who grew up in the Valley, this book provides a wonderful mix of 'answers-to-trivia-questions' and a solid background in many aspects of its history. For those who've never lived in the Valley or never been there, Kevin Roderick's book will tell you that your culture is far more shaped by the Valley and the people in it than you ever knew."
5,Halloween Costume Success!,"I ordered these stirrup pants for my husband's Halloween costume - we were Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible from Disney's 'The Incredibles'. They looked great, and completed his outfit! They came in earlier than I expected, and were brand new. We had a great experience with the product and the seller. Thanks!!"
5,reccomended,"Lauren Winner reccomeded reading this book for Christians. Core message in this book is biblical, which doesn't change with culture generation to generation."
4,An open and honest view on sexuality.,"This book is very straightforward about sex and its relationship to people. In college, this was one of our textbooks for an Ethics class, and I remember being impressed with its view of sex as a joyful, beautiful and SACRED part of a marriage. It seems that with media we get a ""do it all you want/can"" morality that leaves out the sacred/spiritual part of a person, so this book is a good balance to that view.I plan to give this book to my eldest niece for her 13th birthday so that she has another perspective from which to view sex and to make her own decisions about her body and her sexuality.I wasn't too keen about the view of homosexuality in this book, but I tend to be more liberal about the gay lifestlye than most of the fundamental Christianity camp."
5,Fly...kicks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Delilah Harris BigHEADED Girl. I'm a little late I just purchase this cd... Thanks to Amazon I love the way they match artist. I keep this cd in heavy rotation in my home and car stereo. The entire cd is a hit love her voice,style and grace. This is a must have to anyone who loves deep rooted organic soul music. Can't wait for the followup. A true soul artist."
2,Disappointing,"I can't believe this book was the ""United We Read"" selection for this year in Kansas City MO. (I don't know if this is part of a national program, or just KC.) I was very disappointed with this book. Expecting to read some real ""stuff"" about black nuns in the rural south, I ended up skimming much of the going-nowhere story looking for those parts. They were almost not there. The last 20 pages redeemed the story to a very slight degree but overall, this book was a waste of time. Lots of character development -- no real story, no plot, no antagonist, no protagonist. As another reviewer stated, the thoughts and dialog of main character, 10-year-old Vivien Leigh does not ring true to her age (even if she is ""wise beyond her years""). I also felt the story itself did not ring true to the period, or place. At times I wasn't sure if they were in present day or the 50's; California, or Louisiana or somewhere else altogether. The many incongruities were annoying to say the least."
3,average dollar tree book,I wished the making was better and the book itself did not look so cheap they are nice stories and I would be willing to pay a little more for a nice presented book
1,"If there was a zero rating, this would get it.","The review underneath is, unfortunately, biased. Well-written, but biased all the same. Reading the review, it becomes painfully aware that said reviewer is probably a friend of Lunch's or Gregorits'.My appraisal will be short, but bitter: This book sucks.Yeah, RE/Search isn't like this...but then again, V. Vale doesn't obsess over Britney Spears throughout his books.I'd like it if it weren't as pompous as it is. If you can get it for 5 bucks somewhere, do so. Reading this is like a trainwreck meets a miscarriage."
1,why did I buy this?,"I've gotten 3 issues so far. Total waste of money. I didn't realize (My mistake?) that it was published by 7th Day Adventist, which I don't necessarily agree with all their philosophies. I really can't say anything good here. It is way over priced and I have used a single lesson out of any of the books."
4,King of Afro Beat,"Fela tends to be very political and straight forward with what he sings. His sungs tend to be some what offense but that is what makes him who he is. Do not hesistate to pick up as many as his works as possible. Especially his older works, like this one."
3,clean/PG comedy,"Unfortunately i received this one after i got the new one, so i had already heard most of whats on here. not saying not funny, but just buy ""All Over the Place"" instead."
2,Much the Same,"This CD is much like the other CD's that he puts out. He needs to do new stuff to make things different. This CD felt like I heard it all before and the truth is, I had!"
4,Funny Man!,"I liked this CD. Even though I've heard a lot of the material on XM radio, I still found it very enjoyable. I look forward to more by Frank."
5,The reviewer whining about the audio quality is NUTS,"Feel free to check out my other reviews, and make your own judgement; this dvd is top notch, with EXCELLENT video and audio quality. As a matter of fact, this is one of the best reggae dvds you can buy in those two categories. Nuff said....moving forward. This dvd is incredible...the opening sequence and ""Irie"" is fantastic, and some of the songs will blow your mind. D Marley makes an appearance in ""Justice"", and Stephen Marley directs the band with surgeon-like precision, while singing (and sounding) just like his father. If you are a fan of the Marleys, you will thoroughly enjoy this dvd."
1,Does not live up to typical DTS audio sound!,"Do not let the ""DTS"" emblem fool you. I have heard Dolby Digital 2.0 concerts with better sound sound! The audio on this DVD is autrosious! The video is good, and it seems to be a good concert, but the audo is just plain bad!"
4,Good piece of schalorship,"Many of the other books purchased for the research of phallus worship, refer to this book, particularly, Richard Payne Knight's ""A Discourse on the Worship of Priapus"" which opens the book and Thomas Wright's ""The Worship of the Generative Powers"" follows. Good stuff."
3,2 and 1/2 stars really...,i've read many end times outlines and believe me there are better. go to fortbethel.com under books for much better guides.
5,Excellent Book for any Catholic/Christian Family,"The Catholic Family Handbook is an excellent resource for any Catholic family. Fr. Lovasik explains simple ideas to help strengthen your marriage and raise responsible children in the faith of the Catholic Church. He discusses the importance of the marital bond and how that love filters down to strengthen family unity. He discusses techniques for raising your children in the Faith, effective discipline, developing character and communicating love. Fr. Lovasik has written a wonderful book for families of all walks of life!"
5,Best parenting book in print!!!,"This is hands down the best parenting book I have ever read. Unlike so many other parenting books which offer fluff, this one contains concrete actions you can take to strengthen your family and be both a better spouse and parent. On top of that, the advice in this book has stood the test of time and doesn't contain the novelties or fads of modern parenting books that have either been discredited or soon will be.Father Lovasik never had a wife or children of his own but you can tell that he encountered practically every type of family dilemma throughout his years as a Priest and learned what works through first hand experience. Father Lovasik uses traditional Church teaching, scripture and practical advice to explain what it means to be a part of a loving Catholic family. This is a book you will read and re-read throughout the years."
2,"Good, but with problems","The sound is very good,but the product show 2 problems. The funcion "" randon"" don't work and, when I turn off, the music come back at the first."
1,this should get no stars but the system made me give it one,"this is a great example of a book that is written to satisfy someones ego. everything is written to show how smart the author is and how stupid the reader is. if this book was half as good as cogdell obviously thinks he is, then circuits would be a snap. if you want a good book to buy then buy ""principles of electric circuits"" by thomas l floyd."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I have loved Sujata Massey's previous installments in the Rei Shimura series, and was excited to rediscover it in ""The Bride's Kimono."" For the most part, I enjoyed the book. It is a fun mystery, I liked meeting Rei's parents in this story, and the information on kimono was fascinating. The one thing that bothered me as I read, however, were the very negative sentiments toward the US.Pretty much every American character was portrayed negatively, and I got tired of the sentences berating American behavior and customs (everything from sharing desserts to the common use of first names was criticized). Ms. Massey, or her character Rei, seem only to appreciate American chocolate, coffee, and cheese. I think the reason this bothered me is that the heroine of this novel is supposed to be biracial (Asian-American), living 26 years of her life in the US. The negative attitude would have been more acceptable, IMO, if it were coming from someone who had never lived in the US."
3,Much waited for--still waiting,"While I eagerly devoured this new book in the Rei series, I was a little disappointed in the romance side of things. The character seemed to do many stupid things that were out of character. Girl, protect yourself!I did like the mystery aspect, as I was jumping between multiple theories, being led, and enjoyed the ending. The Japanese culture, always interesting as a setting and for flavor.So, if you are addicted to the series, buy it. You know you want to, why are you even reading reviews? If you aren't addicted yet, start with the Salaryman's Wife instead. Then you will be addicted, and can wait for the next installment with the rest of us. ;)"
2,Disappointed,"This is not my first Massey mystery, but it is the first one I have read that set in the US. I must say that I am disappointed because it failed to transport me and immerse me in a culture. It just seemed so ordinary."
3,"Love Rei Shimura, but...","The author spends a lot of time and effort in this book portraying the U.S. and all of the American characters from hotel clerks to police to museum curators in a very negative light. I kept waiting for there to be a plot reason for the American jerk she encountered on the plane....Apparently the only positive aspects of this country from Ms. Massey's viewpoint are the food and the shopping. While I love Rei Shimura, her descriptions of Japan and insights into the Japanese culture, the author's anti-American(s) sentiment really puts a negative spin on this book and detracts from an otherwise interesting plot. Send Rei back to Japan where she can concentrate on something other than nasty people for goodness sake!"
3,"Stay in Japan, Rei","This series is in-part excellent because of the location....Japan. Switch to Washington, D.C., and you've got an ordinary mystery. Hope Ms. Massey is planning on getting Rei Shimura home in time for the next story!"
1,Does not fit 2007 Kia Optima (6 Cylinder),"2007 Kia Optima V6I took the top section (Surge Tank) off of the intake manifold when changing the spark plugs, but when I tried to re-assemble it, I realized that the gasket does not fit. It's close, but it's an inch or so short and several inches wider. Local parts stores had the same incorrect gasket listed as well. I had to purchase the part from a local dealer...Very frustrating"
2,"It tries, and fails.","I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies that explain the zombies but I do like zombie movies that try to set themselves apart from the rest. The western setting is a good setting for this type of movie. The problem is the movie itself. It's just not done well. I didn't mind the low budget or the acting, it was more the story that seemed to fall flat. It was almost like it tried to be better than it should be, but really fell flat across the board. There was also a problem with the nudity which was very, very forced. Any time a female character seemed to be in danger, her top fell off. I like breasts, but it got very silly very quickly."
3,why did i like this movie?,i don't know why i liked this movie. it was not especially good in any way.i did like that guns had to be reloaded and that shots could be missed. i liked that the girls showed a little skin. i don't know what it was but when it ended i found to my suprise that i enjoyed it. i was entertained. i will watch it again in a couple of years when i have forgotten most of it.
1,You smell that?,"You smell that? I wouldn't go in there for least 85 minutes.WARNING FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!!!!!Where was the movie they were showing on the box? That might have been a good movie, I don't know I didn't get to see that one. What I did get was a very bad stinch.I don't know what to say about this movie, other then if you got the $ in you wallet to buy it, leave the $ in you wallet, you'll feel better about it. If you just got to watch it, rent it.It wasn't worth the price I gave for it, and I gave less then this price."
3,"""Little did I know.......""","I do love westerns and I love zombies, putting the two together was an interesting notion. And I will say that it opened with an exciting, ripsnorting shootout. All was well until the lead actor began to speak, it went downhill from there. Amateur theatrics, stiff and overly mannered dialog and delivery thereof, only the zombies really worked (possibly, because they had no dialog). This was an attempt at something out of everyone's range; it remained flat throughout, but definitely watchable. As an experiment, it didn't work but I'm glad I saw it. Not keeping it though."
1,BOOOOOO----This movie was AWFUL!!!,"Bounty hunter cowboy in search of a ""savage"" Indian who gets chased by zombies----oh and who gets stuck with a useless blond that gets everybody killed for her sake. This movie's not worth 17 cents. With all the unnecessary bare breast scenes, and of course the really bad acting, oh and the low budget zombie makeup this movie looked as if it may have been put together by some eighth grade film makers---if so I might be inclined to give this a better rating. Please save yourself the $18 and rent this one if you're still curious, from the movie rental box outside your local grocery store, you probably won't feel so bad losing $1 versus $18."
2,Curmudgeon,"I like low budget zombie movies, however, when the credits scrolled at the end of the filmI was surprised at how many people were attatched to the production.I had thought it was made by a few people with a camcorder.First problem, these are not zombies. They are mutants of some kind.Some of the gore special effects are superimposed by a computer and is noticeable.The high-lights of the film were when the women were topless, and when theblind mutant was after the woman. The make-up effects are pretty good. The dvd cover isvery misleading because none of the mutants were shooting it out with their own guns.Parts of this show were very well made, which is confusing why other parts are so lame.At least there is hope at the end. Enjoy"
3,I really like the idea,"I like the idea for this and it works ok. I agree with one of the other reviews that it would be better if it had a hole for air in the top. I have to keep tilting it back upright and then pour again or the water flow will stop. It puts out a very small stream of water, so if you are watering larger plants that need more water, it is best to take the top off.It works really well for small, difficult to get to plants, as it has a long spout and the water is focused right where I want it to go, decreases the amount of splashing as well."
5,Best tan booster I've ever used,I have tanned on and off over the last 4 years and this is by far the best lotion I have ever used! I prefer the one without the bronzer (I just don't have good luck with those). I get a nice even tan and I don't smell afterward! That was very important to me because I tan over my lunch hour. Another great thing about this product is that I don't feel greasy. It goes on light and silky. I have tried more expensive products but this is definitely my favorite!! I recommend it to all of my friends. :)
1,Return Service?,"Got the item okay, but returning it has been a nightmare. I've sent multiple emails to the seller and have received no reply."
4,Excellent value for low price,This is a 'bagle size' AM/FM clock radio alarm with reasonable sound quality. Excellent value for low price.
1,awful,this cat giving this movie 4 stars is a retard this movie is awful get it and you'll regret it don't even rent this junk. it's that bad. this is not a b movie it's low budget junk.check out money power respect if you want to see a good low budget flick it's pretty good more beleiveable than this junk.
3,This good platform bed but it needs little more finishing,I received this bed before my scheduled time. It was too heavy to handle. I would suggest that this product on assembly is good but needs little more finishing as its edges of platform are not well rounded. I would also suggest that the seller should send a detailed pictorial view describing how to assemble as it took me 4 hours to assemble it together. Over all after assembling it is good and I guess strong enough.
2,You get what you pay for,I bought this thinking that its a great price and free shipping is nice so i can save money....however its very difficult to build it....and its too hard to move it once you build it......I would have rather pay a little extra and buy something that I can take with me when I move......this bed is good for one place use only. .......
4,"Looks great, pieces broke in shipping","This bed got here in 10 days. We unpackaged it on the porch before bringing it upstairs. The instructions were surprisingly easy to read, and it took my dad and I about an hour to set it all up. You definitely need two people. We used a drill with a clutch to get the nails in. If you don't have the clutch, definitely do not use a drill as it will split the board. All put together, this bed looks really great! I love how the base is closed off, so no animals can hide under there. Also, the platform projects far enough out from the base that there is no danger of stubbing my toes, as I thought there might be haha.The only problem was that two of the long, thin accent wood pieces were broken upon arrival. This was fixed by gluing the two pieces together with elmer's wood glue before immediately screwing into place, then touching up with included marker.I highly recommend this bed!"
2,South Shore Furniture,"The product is somewhat cheap in appearance. Some of the material came damaged. I wrote a report, sent pictures, but haven't heard a word from Amazon OR the company. I bought a lot of furniture from South Shore. I've decided NOT to buy from them again."
4,Overall Happy,"Overall very happy with the bed. It was pretty easy to assemble, although it weighs a ton.Worth the 150 I paid for it.Pros: Easy to assemble, functional, affordableCons: Will have to disassemble to move as to not strip screws."
1,Missing hardware X 2.,These producs are what I expected except there was NO hardware in either box. I called and it takes days to get the hardware. I had to call multiple times and leave messages that were not returned. The furniture is fine but I will never buy from this company again and do not recommend anyone else does.
2,Chocolate = DARK DARK DARK Chocolate,Their idea of Chocolate was significantly darker than my idea. That's what I get for buying furniture over the internet.
2,"You get what you buy,","This frame is definitely cheaply made. My fiance & I bought this frame 2 years ago. 2 weeks ago we were moving it into a new apartment, it fell & shattered. All in all, it's a good one if you aren't planning on having it for a while. Wouldn't buy again, however."
1,Not worth the time,"I am not so much reviewing this bed as I am Amazon's service as the bed was never delivered to my house. Apparently it was damaged so badly in transit by UPS that they sent it back without even delivering it here first. So I got an e-mail requesting whether I wanted another one sent in its place or my refund. I opted for the refund. It's been well over a month now, and after 2 phone calls over the past few weeks I still have yet to see a penny of my refund despite the Amazon employees telling me over the phone that it should be just another day or so. Yep, I'm pretty upset. Like I said, not a review on the bed, though I'm under the impression it's a bit flimsy if there are so many reviews that involve destruction in transit. But I'm sorely disappointed in Amazon at this moment."
1,Not a good product,"I order my Platform bed in chocolate but when I received it it was in black and one piece of the wood was in chocolate, also the screw holes did not fit with the other holes, all and all I will never buy from this company again, I'm very disappointed!!!!"
1,returned it,"this bed frame is extremely heavy. therefore, UPS broke the bed frame during shipment. plus the UPS guy was pushing it around and dropping it when he brought it to my building. as a result, one of the side pieces snapped in half during shipment. unless you have a strong person willing to help you unpack this bed and also you can avoid stairs, I recommend you to NOT get this bed. it was a real hassle to return it. it was a big pain to order, have it delivered, and then open the package only to realize it was broken."
2,Broke,"This must be made out of some cheap fiberboard because it was broken when I received it. Not just broken, but SPLIT perpendicular to the length of the box. The split was THREE BOARDS DEEP!! This wasn't just some sort of chipping or scuffing. It looked like some super-awesome Karate Master had chopped it. This may or may not be amazon's fault...it could be UPS; who knows? Haven't decided to get a refund or try this again yet. It doesn't look like it's made of anything sturdy to begin with. I've used this kind of wood to make shelters for farm animals before, never to support the weight of a foam mattress AND 2 adults. Would probably snap if there was some shifting weight on top it. But who knows, maybe the UPS driver didn't want to carry this 150lbs hulking cardboard behemoth up the stairs so he tried to cut some of it off. UPS is the KARATE MASTER!!!!"
4,good,"good value but beware that it is cheap, hard to lift up without stripping the screws so assemble it where you want it. but great value and the base is very sturdy"
3,Hard to put together,"The bed looks nice, but was hard to put together because not all pieces were labeled and the directions were vague. The trim seemed impossible to put around the edges because you were supposed to screw it in from underneath the bed without any pre drilled holes in the trim. I spent quiet awhile screwing the pieces in from underneath then I just gave up and screwed 2 screws on the top of the trim to hold the last piece on. I used dark screws so you can't really tell, but I shouldn't have needed to do that. Since it's a platform bed you can't really get a drill under the bed to screw the trim in so that's what made it impossible by doing it just with a screwdriver. The bed is great for the price, but a pain to assemble! I would just spend a little more and get a quality bed instead of dealing with this one. If I ever sell my house, the bed stays because I can't even imagine taking it apart."
3,Ok product for the money,"This platform bed is a great fit for our memory foam mattress. BUT, we do have a few issues with it. First it was a little difficult to get the screws into the final pieces of putting it together. My husband didn't want to use a drill because he was afraid of ruining the cheap wood so he had a very hard time manually screwing in the screws. It looks nice & I really love the nice dark color. The edges are very, very sharp. Everyone in the house(including our 3 kids) have walked by the bed & hurt their shins by banging them on the sharp edges. The wood is already starting the chip in certain places. Im sure I can cover it with some dark wood stain. It looks great & like an expensive platform bed but it just isn't. It's a good temporary choice for the inexpensive pricetag. I guess I would recommend this for someone looking for a cheap, nice looking bedframe. Otherwise, I would say invest in something with better quality."
4,Great Product for Someone Who is Not Planning to Move,This bed frame is a great product and for the money I would buy it again. The construction is somewhat complicated but once you understand the directions and have someone give you a hand with the larger pieces the final product is a great looking bed frame. I was not thrilled with the fact that the screw holes were not pre-drilled and the supplied screws were coarse thread which split the MDF cross braces because I did not have the ability to pre-drill and counter-sink. I found the bed impossible to put back together when it had to be disassembled to move to another place. Would highly recommend for someone who plans to keep this product for a long time in one place.
2,POS but looks nice.,"The only reason this piece of crap gets two stars is that the finishing looks nice, and hides the fact it is crap. None of the screw holes lined up, 1 of the 4 flat slats that make up the top of the platform was of a completely different material, and cut so crooked it was nearly impossible to put it together at all. Ended up having to drill all new screw holes in all 4 top pieces and the whole thing is slightly crooked to make it fit at all. The 4 pieces were also such different lengths (probably varied by about 1-2 inches) that the end moulding pieces (the dark brown part), didn't fit. One of the boards was so short that in order to make it line up to but the moulding on, it doesn't even touch the top of the bed.Would not buy again, and would not recommend."
1,I just don't know!!!,"I can't give a honest review of this product because after I ordered it I never received it!!!! I was told 3 weeks after ordering that I would be refunded my money And I could re-order, but I never did. I bought a different kind locally."
4,clean simple design,"We purchased this for the guest room in our home. It is a very basic design with nice, clean lines. The bed went together with no problems, though we thought the top edging was a mistake.....the end of the bed has a curved edge facing out and a flat edge facing the mattress. The sides of the bed have the curved edge facing the mattress, with the flat edge facing out. As the curved edging looks more finished, we are at a loss as to why the design was handled in this way. If you are looking for a very reasonably priced simple, functional bed frame, I think it would be difficult to do better than this. This is not 'fine' furniture, it's particle board with a laminated finish, but it's well priced and with the free shipping, very hard to beat."
3,You get what you pay for...,"Just like the other reviews I think, it's not a bad product, nor is it stellar. Build quality is ok and instructions are clear. I was able to build it in a hour with a screw driver. There's an excessive amount of screws in this product and I wish they used more IKEA like tricks to create stability. Net net, this is probably not a bed frame you'll be bring from home to home.Headboard on the other I bought for it was great."
4,Sam old Same old,"I purchased this bed afer looking at many. The bed put together is fine, looksgood is just what I wanted. I had my own headboard to attach to it. The deliverywas good just six days after order. I did what others suggested taking it pices bypices up the stairs. Putting it together was not bad but could have been better, firstthere were no instructions in the package had to call the store, the bed was out ofsquare therefore the holes for screwing were not lined up. But squaring the bed wasno problem if you know how to. There was also suppose to be a touch up pen with thebed which as also not there and there was a lot of touch up. But these problemswere all able to be overcome with much ease, All in all the bed is good and looksgreat."
4,Better than average,"Pros: Fairly easy to put together, even if you are by yourself. Once together looks almost like the picture.Cons: Ends are not even. Even after spending 45 minutes adjusting the 4 planks that make up the platform, it is still uneven enough that I cannot add the rail to the end of the bed.Other thoughts: Not as tall as I imagined it, but that's more my fault than the beds."
1,"bad quality, arrived broke!","Item arrived broke and was of bad quality. Outerbox was fine, however after opening it, the particle board was broke toward the middle. I cannot recommend purchasing this product. Amazon will not refund! I will never purchase furniture from Amazon again. Horrible quality!"
1,this bed is terrible.,"This bed looks nice enough in the pictures. When they shipped it, it was damaged because these huge heavy pieces of melamine press-board stuff were all in one thin cardboard box. It was absurdly heavy for just one box. Some of the pieces were the wrong color. And it's so low, you might as well be sleeping on the floor. and the drawers are pretty bad too. The bottom of the drawer is just a thin piece of cardboard with a fake wood-grain sticker.Amazon was awesome though, they refunded me and made it super easy."
4,Value for money,"I brought this product couple of weeks back and I must say that this is an awesome bed, good value for money. The bed assembling should take only about an hour. The only issue you may face is that you need to be very too careful while assembling the bed or otherwise there are chances that edges might get damaged easily. I had two such instances while I started assembling but later I was careful not to cause any further damage."
2,The price isn't worth the pain,"This seemed like a good deal to go with our new memory foam mattress, but the corners and edges stick out brutally, causing untold amounts of shin injuries. Might be good for a guest room, but nowhere where you will be walking around frequently."
4,A good deal,"This is a great buy. It looks nice, easy assembly and great for a memory foam matress. The only flaw is it is not flush with the matress and have hit my shin on the corners a few times already! Great deal and decent quality."
2,Wouldn't recommend,Pros: Looks GoodCons: Bed is of cheap quality and difficult to put together. I doubt this bed frame would last a move.I would only recommend this bed if you are good at putting hard to put together furniture together; and you weren't planning on moving anytime soon.
5,Im a Glitter Girl!,Morisson Poe is such an amazing band. They are so unique. I love thier music. I have 2 of thier albums and the next one should be out this spring and I cant wait. I have met Jean Morisson personaly and she is an amazing artist. I give them 5 stars. They are one of my favorite bands. And I can truely say I am a Glitter Girl!
5,Loving It,The product was excellent because I love me some Mackie. The price was excellent. It was packaged great. Will order again from Amazon.com
5,local foods and local wines...yum.,"This is not a typical guidebook with lists of where-tos and what-tos. The first 2/3 of the book is a gastronomic pilgrimage circling Spain. Ann and Larry don't attempt for example, to list every good restaurant and wine in Galicia. Instead there's a wonderful story about a quest to find the perfect Albarino (a local white wine grape)and the meals along the way. Somehow the story explains more about the nature of Celtic Spain than any other guidebook I've read. What was especially appealing is that Ann and Larry are not simply searching for the best restaurants or the greatest wine lists; rather their search is for the best of what the region grows. This is a major difference from a book structured on ranking establishments on some sort of scale that could be used in Toledo OH or in Toledo ES. What I want to see is Spain, and I think this book gave our trip a jumpstart."
1,The Wadester is at it again!,"Seeing Wades success for the last 5 years has been phenomenal! So many people have bought his seminars, strategies and books. Believe me THIS BOOK IS NO DIFFERENT than the others! This book is just another sales pitch to get you to buy his seminars and other products. By the time you're done with Wade Cooks system your credit cards will be maxed and your house will have a second or third mortgage. Before buying any of his information PLEASE check with the better business bureau! DO YOUR RESEARCH!P.S. Wades employees do ALL of his positive reviews."
1,Read it with extreme caution - Cook hides the risk involved!,"The author gives the impression that his method is quite fool-proof with minimal risk. It's true that some people will make money out of it but the actual risk involved is also very high, which is not accurately reflected in the book.It's fine to use Cook's system but please be aware that it's a ""all or nothing"" gamble! I'll suggest readers to bet only a small portion of their portfolios."
1,Great book if you like fiction,"I had a review posted about this book a few weeks back that was later removed probably because of pressure exerted by someone in Mr. Wade Cook's army of ex used car salesmen he currently employs in his team of ""financial experts"". If THIS review can prevent even one person from wasting his time and money then I have done something positive. People WAKE UP. Read about this individual -Wade Cook- who wrote this and much other nonsense. Go to ""WADE COOK"" on your web browser and you will find many articles that provide insight into his ""financial genius"". The Motley Fool Website has some well-written articles that show that he is nothing more than a charlatan."
2,A helpful suggestion,"I've never met Wade Cook and haven't taken any ""live"" classes. I do have 5 of his books, some videos, audio tapes, and other training materials. I feel the same way about this book as I do about the majority of his materials. I believe that his strategies are good, and fortunately, he encourages paper trading. However, as usual, I am disappointed in the EXTREME amount of advertising in his books. Most of what he says could be summarized in a pamphlet (once the advertisements are taken out). Once again, the books do not go into depth into how to perform the technical analysis refered to (not covering candlestick analysis, charting analysis, etc... to any useful degree)."
1,Fraud,"This guy was suited by a lot of personal investors.Matter of fact you can find the law suits against him on the Federal Trade Commission web site: FTC.GOV In the search box type in 'Wade Cook'. There are about 31 hits.According to the FTC complaint, WCFC's (Wade Cook Financial Corporation) advertising and promotional materials contain express or implied false claims that Wade Cook had earned and consumers would earn extremely high rates of return - returns of 20% or more per month - on their investments using Cook's trading strategies.Another words, the man can't walk the talk.Fraud"
1,"Dangerous for new traders, Old traders know better.","Any experienced option trader is familiar with all the material in this book, particularly floor traders. Guess what; you will not find any experienced traders doing this strategy because they know it is a losing strategy. Sure you can get lucky a few times with the ""Free Stocks"" method, but sooner or later, the reality of volatile stocks or falling stocks will destroy your trading account - it happens everyday, but Wade doesn't mention this fact.Read Natenberg's option book ""Option Volatility & Pricing"" and get a REAL education instead. It will save you from losses that ""Free Stocks"" is certain to create for new traders that don't know any better."
5,Great book on writing covered calls,"This book is much more th an just a trading book or even just a covered call book. This book by Wade teaches you little known niches in the m arket that only the most sophisticated know about. and they ain't tellin us anything! Fortunately, Wade is. Thanks Wade."
5,Seriously recommended reading,"In Free Stocks: How To Get The Market To Pay For Your Stocks - Free!, Wade Cook demonstrates and documents how to get the market to pay for a stock within five to seven months by using his ""New LOCC"" system. Cook explains about option cycles and market makers; how implied volatility affects option pricing; buybacks and rollouts; a ""Stock Repair Kit""; how to put volatility on the side of the seller; when you get your money; ways to increase gains and reduce taxes, and what to do if the stock dips so that you can make more money still! Free Stocks is seriously recommended reading, especially for those new to the stock market and how it functions."
2,It's Awful!,"This belt is one of the major components in the oven. It is awful! I did not expect cheap plastic! Now I know why it wears out so fast! This belt should be the same quality as a serpintine or fan belt on an automobile but it's not! IT'S CHEAP PLASTIC! Only buy this belt if you cannot find another. If you buy this belt you better buy more than one. It's not going to last. Very, very disappointed!"
5,First Rate and Comprehensive!,This is by far the most comprehensive of the books on After Effects. I've bought other books on After Effects from Amazon and returned one of them because it was quite bad! The Bible is first and foremost huge and comprehensive. It covers topics like Motion Math in detail I have not seen anywhere else. Same with Expressions and Keys! The tutorials are numerous and every function is explained via a tutotial or another. Great Book! And I am still plumbing the depths of it.
2,alphaball,"Not suitable for children under 9. trackball is slow to respond at times, as is the game itself at times. Game button doesn't toggle between games unless you depress the trackball first (contrary to instructions). If you can't slove the word scramble in the time period, you don't get to see the correct answer. Based on the web description, I expected this to help teach spelling - it doesn't."
4,Seductive and ear opening,"This set is usually underrated for reasons that are understandable. Maazel concentrates so intensely on bringing out details of Mahler's orchestration that the forward momentum and general structure of the piece are often lost. ""The forest is lost for the trees"", if you will. But what trees! I have never heard orchestral playing like the VPO delivers in these recordings. It's not just a matter of tonal beauty or technical perfection. Every player seems distinguished and is encouraged to play with maximum expression. You couldn't get further away from Karajanian homogeneity.And like close scrutiny of a painting one has seen only from a distance, one's appreciation of the work is seriously increased.I'm not sure this set is recommendable as a beginner's choice. But after getting the general rhetoric and dramatics of the pieces from, say, Kubelik or Haitink, it's a great way to get closer to these remarkable symphonies."
1,Accents and narration kill this story,"Spotty and intrusive bits of third person narration pop up in random places, disrupting the flow of the story, not adding much to the story that couldn't have been covered in the rest of the book. These interludes also have a haughty tone that distract from the reading experience.Written accents are automatic turn-offs for me. Reading what is more or less a ""cute"" speech impediment as seen in five year old children has a detrimental effect on the flow of the story. If the author were to describe this unique feature in his aliens' speech patterns, that's one thing. Putting every added ""z"" and ""w"" sound in only serves to irritate the reader.I only got about a third of the way into this book because of the above two mentioned turn-offs. The story, what I read of it, was fairly unremarkable."
5,just beautiful,When I first bought this CD I was addicted for a while. The singing is beautiful and the music is too. I had hoped for more traditional japanese instruments but it is still beautiful.
3,Not very eastern -- at all,"Well, this is very beautiful, and it is very relaxing. I'm sure the quality of the voice work done on this disc is excellent, though I'm not an expert.The problem is, it is not Japanese, except for the songs themselves. The instrumentation is completely western, and the arrangements of the songs tend to downplay the eastern sound of the compositions. Maybe I just didn't understand what this would be: I didn't expect koto music or anything, but I did expect to expose my children to a different type of musical structure."
2,"Very nice looking showerhead, very poor performance","The Danze showerhead looks great.. Very nice Chrome look, easy to install. But once you get beyond the finished look, the performance leaves a lot to be desired. The best term I can use to describe the water flow would be weak. It was much weaker compared to the cheap plastic showerhead that was previously installed. Again, the item looks great but the performance leaves a lot to be desired..."
5,This has to be one of the best books I ever read.,I saw the story of Marshall on the Oprah Winfrey show and I cried the whole time. He helped point out to me that life wasn't as complex as everyone was making it out to be. I really beleive that he is an angel and God wants him to help spread his word. It made me stop and think that maybe all the people we take for mentally challenged have this same gift. Maybe we should all look a little deeper into our hearts and we may posses this gift also.
1,Kiss of God is Hoax,"'Facilitated Communication,' which is the method used to write this book, has been disproven as a hoax. I know it seems harmless enough when a 'lost' child begins telling Mom and Dad he loves them, or when he writes poems to his brother. However, this hoax has destroyed lives with false allegations of abuse that have later been over-turned once facilitated communication was disproven. This just further perpetrates the injustice and endangers the welfare of those whose lives have been disrupted by self-deceived, but well-meaning parents and facilitators."
1,cant use it,poorly advertised product. i Couldnt use it for my shaver and had to send the package back. i wont buy this again
5,Find myself humming these songs at the office,"Like most of the Putumayo Kids series cds, this is a great collection of fun songs. Bananaphone is my favorite, but they are all very nice songs (with the exception of Taj Mahal's ""Don't you push me down"" which just strikes a wrong chord with me (and what is that strange bit at the end about girls with make-up?!)). I can also recommend Putumayo Kids: French Playground, African Playground, Reggae Playground and Celtic Dreamland."
5,Fun and not annoying!,"I love Putumayo for grown ups-- and this kid album doesn't disappoint. The songs are singable but not annoying, and the album includes refreshing takes on old favorites, like Old MacDonald and You are My Sunshine. Great! Better than Cats!"
4,A study of the music industry during the 90s,"Was only a passing Semisonic fan, but this isn't a book about the band so much as it is about a musician's unique road to success and the foibles of record labels during the band's rise. Enlightening and fun. I recommend the book."
4,Now write about the book writing/publishing industry,"This is quite an interesting book. I read an excerpt online and had to get my hands on it and then couldn't put it down. Slichter tells his story so well he really should write about his experience with the publishing industry for those of us left ""missing"" him at the end of this book."
4,Smooth transition from drummer to writer,"What a pleasant surprise of a read. Slichter really does have a terrific writing style and a genuine gift for weaving humor into his storytelling. The story of Semisonic is hardly the most tragic in rock n' roll history, but this book places many larger aspects of life in the big-money music world into perspective. Wanna-be rock stars beware."
4,good fun read,"A nice revealing read about the not so fabulous music industry. Unlike most rock bios, Jacob never overdosed on heroin, or pulled trains on pig-tailed cheerleaders ( or if he did, he left it out of this book ) A fun read with some dry wit."
3,Awesome inside view of being in a rock band.,As a musician wanting to make music a career I found this bookto be a great benefit to read. It offered a fantastic insider's view of the work of a working rock band from its very beginning steps to the upper rungs of the ladder. A must read for any musician thinking of prusuing music as a serious career.
2,Dullest band ever,"It's easy to see why they were a one hit wonder. The insights into the mechanization of the music business were very interesting but the writer himself is a total bore. The whole band seems really lame. They don't DO anything. They apparently don't interact with other musicians their touring with, no groupies, no road antics, nothing. The highlight of their tour with matchbox 20 was watching Law & Order reruns. The highlight of their trip to Vegas? Watching TV in the hotel room. I get his point about the absurdity of the music business but the cover would lead you to believe these guys actually attempted to have fun once in awhile. This book is like reading the tour diary of Mormon missionaries. If you are looking for a good book about living the rock-n-roll lifestyle, go with Motley Crue's ""The Dirt."""
2,"Good Moral, but needs something to it","Yup, we've all read how moralistic this book is and how if Abby isn't ready for a realationship, then all the more power to her! I agree wholeheartidly but this story is like bones with no meat. It lacks depth and, well, OOPH. You know what I mean, I assume. It is like Anne wrote it in a few minutes, and then ran off to her publisher to get the book published. I love the BSC books, I have been an avid reader from the very start. But it is getting very clear to me that all the new BSC books are getting flowery and kind of, well, stupid. I think it's time to move on to a new series! :)"
2,It was okay...,"Abby's Un-Valentine was okay, but not that great. First of all, Kristy and Abby are 13, and they don't seem to have a mature interest in guys. That's kind of unrealistic, but that's not really the reason I didn't favor the book. The plot is sort of boring. It might be a good subplot, but not a real plot. It dragged, and it was pretty tedious to say the least. I really don't suggest you read this book."
3,"Funny, but a little boring","Abby's Unvalentine shows that Abby isn't ready to have a relationship yet. It teaches us to take oour time, if we don't want to do it. Don't. You probably are not ready for it."
1,Not Very Good,This book is not very good because Abby finds a lot of Valentine notes on the walls.Her friends try to help her who's been writing notes Anna her sister says she didn't write them at all.
1,a waste of time,"Obviously, the weakest point of this recording is the pop singer Bocelli. Though I've enjoyed some of his solo discs, he is out of his element here. Even his sound is out of place, and he is very closely miked (because of his small voice). Thus his sound does not match the rest of the soloists. I guess Philips felt they would sell more copies with a pop singer than with a classical tenor. What a pity! Was Renee fleming just substituting for Madonna? Aside from Bocelli, the recording is not remarkable."
1,let ME sing that,"I always loved to sing at school, in the choir and .... also while taking a shower. I have a tenor voice and can hit the right notes with a probability of 98%. I have never had any lessons but I AM SURE I WOULD NOT SOUND WORSE THAN MR. BOCELLI!Stay away, this recording is RIDICULOUS."
3,"OK, but there are so many better versions","I listened to this performance with great anticipation and was a little disappointed. Renee Fleming doubtless has a beautiful voice but somehow she lacks in my opinion the gravitas for this profound work. I have the same observation with regard to Bocelli. The orchestration at times achieves the right sense of drama, but is inconsistent. Certainly for someone wanting an introduction to the work and attracted by the superstars this is not nearly as bad as some of the reviewers suggest, but for purists there are many better versions out there and this one hardly displaces any of them."
4,Quite a cd,"This is an enjoyable recording of Verdi's Requiem. Valery Gergiev brings great feeling and emotion to Verdi's music. Renee Fleming once again amazes me with her vocal control, beauty, and how she seems to make it all sound so easy. Borodina's Mezzo-Soprano is very rich and beautiful. She and Fleming blend very well together and seem to compliment each other. Bocelli is very lacking in his performance. At times his tone sounds anemic when contrasted to the other great voices on this recording."
1,Why?,"Given the splendor of Gergiev, Fleming and Borodina this recording has been highly touted. BIG disappointment......While Gergiev's operatic approach is viable, this performance is like a string of stop and go ideas. Yes Fleming and Borodina maintain their reputations, as does bass D'Arcangelo, but when will record producers stop pulling Bocelli out of his Pop element and let him blast away at ballads instead of blistering opera? This ends up being a commercial vehicle for Bocelli fans instead of a contribution to the bulging ranks of recorded Verdi Requiems. Makes you wonder why Gergiev consented to record this. Pass......"
1,The ultimate marketing and hype gimmick,"The good points:The exquisite voice of Renee Fleming(what in god's name is she doing on this recording?)and an excellent and spirited performance by the Kirov orchestra and chorus.The bad:Not so much Bocelli's singing(faux Enrique Iglesias crooning)as the decision of the higher ups at Phillips to stoop and give more momentum to the worsening plague of ""crossover"" albums;a marketing con that sticks pop music performers into the classical world and vice versa.Naturally, the result of this abominable crossbreeding is compromised standards,compromised integrity and a spate of cd's useful only as drink coasters.We can stop this insidious plague by not buying these gimmicky recordings.I've learned my lesson the hard way;don't waste your money on this tripe.If you want a great recording of the requiem try Solti's Vienna Philharmonic version or the immaculate Robert Shaw 1987 Telarc disc."
1,What a disaster!!!,"I have never heard a worse performance of Verdi's Requiem and I think the great composer would turn in his grave if he listened to this crime against his masterpiece. Fleming and Bocelli are miscast. Things just fail to come together. If you want a good requiem, in my opinion the best in the market is the DVD with Claudio Abbado directing and a cast that includes Angela Gheorghiu and her husband."
3,Don't forget da band,"The weak link is Bocelli among the singers. My review, though, is in praise of the Kirov Theatre Orchestra - brassy, in-your-face, FIRE. Reminds me of Chicago SO under Levine: if you want to instill fear, you have to play fearlessly. Moreover, their showboating (and I say that in a good way) is backed up by the contrasting restraint in the other sections.D'Arcangelo is a nice surprise, so 3 for 4 is not a bad quartet.My recommendation: Buy it on sale."
2,This rendition of Verdi's requiem is unacceptable,"I agree with many people who have a problem with Andrea Bocelli. Surely, they could have chosen a much better tenor, like Jose Carerras or Roberto Alagna. Renee Fleming does have a charming voice, and Borodina has great depth in her emotion, but these two don't seem to fit as a balanced cast in this requiem by Verdi. And personally, I prefer Gergiev conducting the Russian operas, not an Italian piece.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this version of Verdi's requiem to anyone. Bocelli is just not operatic with his voice. He should stick with his Pop music and stay away from Puccini, Donizetti, etc.I would recommend conductor Emil Tabakov's version, with singers Romanko, Ombuena, and de Grandis. As long as the CD on Capriccio Records doesn't run out of stock."
1,"Run away. Run far, far away","I FINALLY got around to listening to this recording after a friend bought it out of curiosity. Oh my. I realize this was at the height of the Andrea Bocelli craze, but the Verdi Requiem? Sacrilege.There are so many things wrong with his performance, it's hard to begin. First, the vocal quality is amateurish - he is obviously amplified. His pitch is questionable, his phrasing odd and his diction sloppy. I've heard other Bocelli recordings and even his Italian is bad!Renee Fleming, as always, is magnificent. The other singers are adequate, as is the orchestra. Nothing inspiring.In short, it sounds like a high school student won a contest to sing with the big kids."
5,essential lee clayton,"it is worth buying this cd if only for the track i ride alone,originaly from the naked child album a truly great talent who i am sure dire straits had in there collection"
4,Worth the price,"Quick and simple. This one was worth the price. If you like old school gaming, then it's for you. I don't mind all the shooters and solo games that have dominated the last 5+ years, but I sure like getting back to a nice team based game. Not one where you are relying on your buddy to make the right move and cover your butt... but you making sure your butt is covered by placing your guys in the right spots.Wish more would come out like this again..."
5,Classic game,I played this game while growing up. still have it on my old computer and it is great game to ocassionally go back to. This game is a classic.
5,Essential Twilight Zone Disc!!,"This is by far the best volume in the 1-5 set! It deals with themes of Artificial Life and a twist on the origins of man!""Long Distance Call"" -- a chilling episode about a little boy and his dying grandmother. [**]""I Sing the Body Electric"" -- an robotic nanny is built to take care of some children. They grow attached to her... [**1/2]""The Lonely"" -- Perhaps the best TZ episode ever? A prisoner on a lifeless planet is given a robot companion. He is at first reluctant to buy into this illusion, but this illusion becomes his reality... [*****]""Probe 7, Over and Out"" -- Great episode written by Sterling about a man who crashes his spaceship on a (seemingly) uninhabited planet. He later discovers his home planet destroys itself in a nuclear war... Fantastic suprise ending! [****]---If you're only passively interested in the TZ, this should be one of the first DVD volumes that you buy! It contains some truly exceptional episodes."
4,"Grandmothers, Robots and War","Volume 5 of Collection One features four good episodes. ""Long Distance Call"" is somewhat predictable, but the acting makes it entertaining. ""I Sing the Body Electric"" was written by Ray Bradbury and is about the newest member of the family: Grandmother/Robot. The story focuses on family as its theme, however, not science fiction. ""The Lonely"" is the best episode of Volume 5 and involves a convict in years of solitary confinement. ""Probe 7"" is initially suspenseful, and ends with an interesting twist. Overall this collection is quite good and recommended."
4,Not that bad,"This DVD features 3 great episodes! ""The Lonley"" is the best one on this DVD. It's got Jack Warden and Jean Marsh. And there are some great lines in it too. ""Long Distance Call"" is one of the best ones ever made. It's got Billy Mumy who can talk to the dead on his toy telephone his grandma left him before she died. ""I Sing the Body Electric"" is written by the great Ray Bradbury. It's a remarkable episode. The weakest of the 4 is ""Probe 7-over and out."" But the rest are all great."
4,REESE TOWPOWER 74280 COUPLER,"THIS WAS A REPLACEMENT COUPLER OF THE EXACT STYLE, AND THE FIT IS GOOD AND OPERATION IS PERFECT.THE COUPLING LOCK ASSY SEEMS TO BE A BIT LOOSE, BUT IT WORKS GREAT. THANKS BRIAN"
3,It is good,"For the price it can't be beat. The rolodex line works well enough, but the unit is light and the plastic slides all over the desk if anything touches it. Double sided tape or velcro will fix that though!"
3,"not what i wanted, you neglected an important piece","I would really really like to have heard the song that plays in the background when spacey finds angela crying in the living room, unable to identify it from the film, i bought the soundtrack hoping it would be on there, but to no avail. Now I have a soundtrack with some awesome tunes, just not the one i was hoping for, could you pleeeeze! let me know what it is. Your awesome composer could have used more time too!"
3,Thomas Newman should have MUCH more of his stuff on this CD,"One of the most beautiful film soundtracks that I have heard in quite a while - but the CD disappointed me. As far as I was concerned the atmospheric Thomas Newman soundtrack was all that I cared about - unfortunately the CD manufacuterer (or someone) saw fit to give the composer 7.5 minutes on a 45 minute CD - please release Newman's complete score. That's what I suspect most listeners will want from an ""original"" soundtrack recording."
2,Baba O'Reilly,"This soundtrack is deceptive. I agree with those who suggested soundbytes and including the proper tracks. Buy the other soundtrack. All Newman, all the time. Fabulous, haunting stuff. The real name of 'Teenage Wasteland' by the way, is Baba O'Reilly. I once won Who tickets because I knew the proper title for this song, so it stuck."
3,"Needs more Thomas Newman, and the better songs of the movie.","The missing song in the climactic scene is Annie Lenox's remake of ""Don't let it bring you down,"" very easy to find as an MP3. The CD needs more of Thomas Newman's original score, and all of the songs of the movie. This should've been released as a 2-CD set, or on separate CDs. Newman is of course a genius and needless to say, the movie would not be the same without this soundtrack. Dreamworks, or whoever releases this stuff, should quickly wake up and learn that both the instrumental and spoken songs are essential to this movie, and the public is ready and willing to buy them."
5,american beauty,I loved the soundtrack to american beauty from the first time i saw the movie. (i've seen it three times) there is such an interesting mix of music from balai hai (South Pacific) to classic rock of the sixties.
3,Lennox missing,"Well, this is for the reviewer from Illinois, whose review was dated januari 17. The track you missed on this cd is a song by Annie Lennox, coming from, correct me if I'm wrong, her Medusa album...One of the best albums ever...Hope to have served you well...To be quite honest that was also one of the few songs of the movie I liked..."
3,Whooops....,"Okay, I bought this CD instead of the score. It's okay. It isn't as good as the score and doesn't get listened to nearly as often, but it's not bad. The mix is a little weird Peggy Lee, The Who, and Bobby Darin don't exactly blend well. I wouldn't recommend letting it play the whole way through. However, the individual songs are quite good and I am pleased to have them a part of my personal music collection."
3,Where is the score?,"I am enraptured by Thomas Newman's music and want the score from the movie. The soundtrack is OK but the transcendent feelings evoked by the storyline are reflected in Newman's poignant musical interpretation - not a choppy mix of popular songs used in bits and pieces throughout the film. However, I believe this CD is a justifiable addition to any music collection because ""American Beauty"" is simply the best movie of all time!!!"
3,"Hopefully to be referred to fondly as ""Volume I""","This is a lovely disk for what it is; the selection of pop songs is effective (if incomplete; I too would have liked Annie/Neil's ""Old Man""). What galls me (and I think I'm not alone in this) is the almost total lack of the stirring, etherial Newman tracks (which are tantalizingly exerpted on the movie web-site). A second album, containing Newman's complete score would be most welcome. Just call me a seeker."
1,I want Newman!,"I'm gonna have a serious temper tantrum if someone doesn't release the actual Thomas Newman score. The songs on this soundtrack were fine in the context of the movie but the score was a genuine work of art. When I reflect on this truly great movie (which is often) I hear the score in my head, not these pop songs."
2,"""Where is ""Don't Let it Bring You Down""?","I loved the soundtrack in the movie; however, this compilation lacks the intensity. Where is the ""easy to find"" MP3 of Lennox's version of the AWESOME Neil Young ""Don't Let it Bring You Down""? Don't want the entire album Medusa, but it was the most powerful song of the movie, closely followed by ""Because"" (last best done by Zappa). MP3 folks, help me out, the only downloads I found were outdated. Wish it were on this soundtrack as it is the MONEY song of the film."
3,Imperfect,"I would definitely agree that we need to hear more of Thomas Newman - expected all the pop, but certainly hoped to hear more of his brilliance. Please let me know if something comes out with more of his"
2,Where's the rest of it?,"Where's the rest of the music? I was looking for, like the rest of you, Annie Lenox's Don't Let it Bring you Down. Not only that but Dylan's All Along the Watchtower, Guess Who's American Woman and more of the score from Thomas Newman. People at Dreamworks give us a part 2 soundtrack?"
2,Not up to par with the amazing film,"I love American Beauty, and I thought the score, and music were fantastic, but the soundtrack lacks. Many of the songs were not in the movie at all.It failed to include two very important songs:""All Along the Watchtower"" Bob Dylanand the Annie Lennox song played by Angela before Lester seduces her.The songs also are in a completely different order than they were in the film, with ""All Right Now"" as track number 3, when it didn't appear until the last 20 minutes of the film.Good Film. Bad Soundtrack."
4,"Good, but check out the REAL thing...","If you have an interest in the film, if it moved you (and, if it moved you, you know you're not the same you were before you saw the film), and that's why you're here, then I recommend you check out the soundtrack by the composer, Thomas Newman, which is also available here. This CD has some of the evocative music he composed for the film, but not nearly enough to rekindle the glint in your mind's eye. Probably the sole reason (& it is a good one) for buying this is the Elliott Smith ""Because."" It melds Beatles with Beach Boys, & stops time & breath until it's finished with you. The Newman soundtrack has none of this more pop sound. It goes deeper, and that's probably why you're looking for the soundtrack anyway, right?"
1,Song in TV Commercial--The Who's Baba O'Reilly,"Several people have posted here wondering what the song is in the TV commercial. That is the Who's ""Baba O'Reilly."" You've probably heard it...it is the song that goes ""Teenage Wasteland."" Interestingly, the protagonist in that song runs away with the girl next door. ""Baba O'Reilly"" is on the album ""Who's Next."" If you like it you might be interested to know that the song also is featured in the movie _Summer of Sam._"
3,"""Because"" . . . it's beautiful","Elliot Smith's cover of the achingly simple and gorgeous song, ""Because"" was the highlight of the score to this movie.'Because the sky is blue/ It makes me cry'--the lyrics match the movie's theme of finding beauty in ordinary existence perfectly.The sound of Elliot's voice is extroardinary--simple and beautiful."
3,"WHAT""S THAT SONG!!!","What is the name of the song on the preview to American Beauty??? I love it, and now it's on a new preview to a movie called The Girl Next Door. If someone can help me it would be wonderful"
3,A good mix of music.,"I like the songs on the cd but there are two songs missing that I really enjoyed in the movie: ""American Woman"" and the song that plays when Mena Suvari and Kevin Spacey finally kiss in the dark room. Could someone please tell me what that song is and who sings it? I was really disappointed that it wasn't included in the soundtrack."
2,mehhhh....,"Hate to say it, but all the great songs are left out. I don't want to cheat anybody out of music rights or anything, but save your pennies and download the songs you want and make your own American Beauty soundtrack."
4,no 'American Woman'?,"this soundtrack would get 5 stars if 'American Woman' was on it. what was Dreamworks thinking leaving off Lester's 'driving while smoking pot' song? instead there's an awful song by Gomez. thankfully Bobby Darin, The Who & Thomas Newman's music make this worth getting for any fan of the movie >=:)"
2,Disappointed,"I agree with most of the other people...I purchased this CD solely for the Annie Lennox song ""Don't let it bring you down"" and it isn't even on there. I can only give this CD a 2..and yes the other songs missing by The Guess Who ""American Woman"" especially are a huge disappointment."
1,travesty,Why do record companies release film soundtracks? Why do people buy them? This includes songs that are and songs that aren't on the film and bastardised versions of themes which satisfy no one. Buy the DVD and turn the TV to the wall!
2,THE GUESS WHO MISSING....,"ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE SCENE OF THIS MOVIE IS KEVIN SPACEY SMOKING POT IN HIS CAR & SINGING ""AMERICAN WOMAN"" BY THE GUESS WHO.... & THIS SONG IS NOT ON THE SOUNDTRACK ! VERY DISSAPOINTING ! WHY??????????????????????"
3,The Song you Love may not be on this CD!,"Thank you - a bit too late - to A. Knopp. I was haunted by the song in the scene where Kevin Spacey was finally going to make it with his daughter's girlfriend. It sounded like a blues-y Joni Mitchell but I couldn't place it. Went down to the store to buy the CD and was really upset that the song wasn't on the American Beauty album. As I was continuing to obsess about the song, I hunted more on the net and found Knopp's comments - it's the wonderful Annie Lenox - and she's NOT on the soundtrack CD. Be careful if this is the song you're looking for."
4,Missing Tracks,"Ok, there's tracks missing. Ok, it's such a great soundtrack either. I would like to buy my soundtrack and hear Annie's tune ( her cover by Neil Young's Don't Let It Bring You Down) and the smashing original version of American Woman by the great Guess Who. Ok, they're not on American Beauty Soundtrack but there's a cure for this: listen all the others tracks, especially Elliott Smith's ""Because"" and ""The Seeker"", by The Who. I hope it works."
3,Glad I didn't order this soundtrack!,"Thank you, Mike Etheridge and K. Brogan for your very helpful reviews. I, too, was transfixed by the song played during the scene with the Kevin Spacey and the daughter's friend, and pulled up the soundtrack here to try to find that song. I knew the voice was Lennox but couldn't find it on the soundtrack. Had I not begun reading the reviews it would have taken me a long time to hunt down the song ""Don't Let It Get You Down"" by Annie Lennox from her Medusa album. Many thanks again for saving me tons of time - now I know which CD to buy..."
3,Little did I know,I bought this album locally at a much higher price today thinking that it would be the haunting melody soundtrack from American Beauty. Little did I know that there are only two haunting melody tracks on this CD. One lasting only 3:18 minutes and the other lasting only 4:05 minutes. The rest of this CD had different songs from the movie that were OK but nothing all that memorable to me.Thank you Amazon. Now I know that there is another American Beauty soundtrack with music ONLY from Thomas Newman. That's the one I really wanted and that's the one I'm about to order.
2,Hardly a soundtrack,"This album, like most on the market, shouldn't be called a soundtrack. It's missing the film music by the great Thomas Newman (only two cuts!). If I want a pop album, I'll go to the pop section; I wanted a soundtrack and will wait for the soundtrack to be released."
2,"Annie Lennox , American Woman, Thomas Newman ?","Sure wish I'd read all these reviews before I bought the soundtrack. I LOVED the movie and couldn't wait to hear the music. But what I listened to had nothing to do with what I was expecting. Now I have to buy 2 more records : Medusa by Lennox, and the brillant score by Newman. I find it totally unprofessional that a longer CD with ALL THE SONGS AND SCORE was not released. Everyone would have bought it. Too bad, really too bad . And to make matters worse, the score hasn't even been released yet in France. Only the soundtrack."
2,would be if he could be,"bought this cd on the cheap, mainly based on the various reviews,what a disappointment it is, if Steven Mayer is regarded as a great classical pianist, then he should stay with the classics, first off, Mayer is attemptingthe impossible, he cannot finger as fast, he cannot reproduce that special Tatum tone and touch, and he lacks the ability to play the bass notes as Tatum did,and the most glaring ommission of all, is the instant creativeness of Tatum,Tatum never played any tune exactly the same every time he performed it,as I use a ipod to and from work every day, with a varied number of different artist from all musical backgrounds from pop to classics to jazz, Tatum isincluded, and the ipod is set to random, no matter how many times Tatumcomes up, its a total delight and almost a first time experience to hear him,so I was totally shocked when I first heard these Mayer versions, what aletdown! it has reinforced my view of how great and unique Tatum was and is"
5,"Perfect Companion to ""Devil in the White City""","In an unprecedented short period of time, the finest architects of the day (including Frederick Law Olmsted of Central Park fame) designed and built the many buildings that made up the Chicago World's Fair. This book shows the success of their Herculean efforts. Further, it is the perfect companion to ""Devil in the White City"" (the white city is the World's Fair). While reading ""Devil,"" I went on-line often to find pictures of the buildings being discussed, the first Ferris Wheel (which held over 2,000 people!), etc., but was disappointed in how few pictures I was able to find. ""The Chicago World's Fair of 1893: A Photographic Record"" made the on-line search unnecessary. Since then, I have given the ""Photographic Record"" together with ""Devil in the White City"" to several people and recommended it to many more. Everyone agrees that the ""Photographic Record"" is the perfect companion as well as a great book on its own."
3,Comprehensive coverage,"This is an okay pictorial collection of White City photographs. None were new to me, though. My chief complaint is that all of the most striking photographs are blown up to span two pages-- which means they're cut right down the middle. I would have been happier with photographs oriented vertically to maximize the space on one page while preserving the image."
2,Archos 604 DVR - prone to break,"The device is fine, but I'm about to get a 2nd RMA. These things are prone to failure."
4,Great Media Player,"This media player is amazing it has an impressive interface with many features. It supports nearly every format I have tried on it, the product itself paired with the cool accessories such as a DVR station and Camera makes it a great buy. The only two reasons I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is first the button layout is somewhat of a challenge to get used to. One button is up and down, another is left and right, and another is diagonally basically. Just a strange setup id you ask me. The other reason is The built in speaker is very sub par. This isn't too big of a deal because you should basically be using headphone on it as it is an mp3 player."
4,Good for the money,"This is a good device as a viewer for pictures, however movie downloads are a bit more complicated. We tried to click and drag, use Windows media syncro and it didn't see how to get files into the device (as the files come up separate and don't integrate). The easy way is to buy for $100. USD the Archos docking cradle and record off Dish, VCR, DVD or TV. It is slim and fits into your pocket in it's case, has good resolution for viewing and is fairly simple to learn to use. Picture files are easy to download and has a scrolling picture viewer in 3D or flip and fade. You can also use it to carry business files around if you so needed. Overall is it good technology and seems fairly substancial. Jazzbebop7"
1,Missing software,"From the information I saw prior to purchase, this player would play anything that's out there.Based upon that belief I purchased one, only to discover that not only will it not play mp4 files, it even has a built in message indicating the necessity of going to the archos site to purchase one!To me that's serious customer abuse - setting me up to expect a fully functional product, then indicating ""Oh, you want to play podcast video?, Well, that's extra..."".Note that my rating isn't for the product, it's for archos and its sleeze-ball marketing department."
1,NO RAW file support!,"The following review is only interesting for photographer:The main reason for me to buy the product was to backup and store photos from my Canon to a harddisk and have a fast viewer for the photos. I shoot the photos in .jpg and .raw format.I upgraded my Archos from the former AV 420 which did support .jpg and .raw backup from my Canon, but the photo viewer was incredible slow.You don't find any Information about storing the .raw format on your Archos... I bought the product in the believe that an upgrade can't mean a step back in the development... which was an error... it really DONT support .raw ... I asked the helpdesk if they plan to support the .raw file in future... their answer was NO, they decided against raw format.Nevertheless the picture viewer and the video things work fine, just for those who want to store .raw files as in the past, forget it...Thanks Archos, so you make it easy for photographer to change the backup system to other companies like Creative."
5,Hirson is the most innovative new American playwright!,"This is an exciting new piece of theater writing. It is brilliantly witty and creative, evocative and lenguistically rich! It is also a delight to read aloud!"
3,10 minutes just doesn't seem enough time,"I mainly wanted this for the leg /hip stretches. I was a little disappointed because it required having a wall to use for one of the series and I just don't have wall space in a place where the tv is still visible. But I am guessing this isn't a common problem. The 10 minutes goes by so fast. Its a little hard the first time through since there is almost no time allowed for the transitions and figuring out what you are supposed to be doing, but that makes sense since it only has 10 minutes to get through everything, can't spend too much time explaining. I am sure the next couple times through will be much better."
1,Lackluster stretches.,"All the stretches depicted in this video were all very basic, and having a host that seemed ""unenthusiastic"" made the 10 minutes of stretching agonizing. If you're looking for a good stretching video I would highly recommend the Tammilee stretch video."
3,Not enough of a program,Too slow except if you have not worked out and strenged in a very long time. You need to do the program 2x to benefit.
4,stretch dvd review,received the product in a timely manner but have not yet opened it to see it. Im sure i will enjoy it. shipping was quick.
3,Nothing against the streches offered BUT the hold time is too short....,I agree with Amelie Bolduc...The stretch hold times are too short and I myself am trying to master the streches in my memory so I can do them without the dvd. That's the only complaint I have. The type of stretches offered are a great variety for the different type of lifestyles u may have.
2,A little too advanced for me,"Excellent production quality. But the stretches are a little advanced for me. The video assumes that you already have a certain degree of flexibility, such as the ability to sit cross legged. I am using Bob Anderson's Stretching DVD because it starts at the beginning."
4,Great present for my wife,"Bought this for my wife and she loved it. She was looking for something like this at the stores, but could never find it. Nice variety & very simple."
4,Happy With My Purchase,I am happy with my purchase of the Perfect in Ten: Stretch. I really enjoy being able to do a good 10 minute stretch a few times a day. I always feel better after I use this DVD. I like it because it has a very good variety of different types of stretches. It was well worth the money!
2,Not a workout,It's not good as a workout. I feel like this DVD functions more to give you ideas of how to stretch throughout the day rather than as an actual workout. The seated stretch section could be useful for the elderly. I did like some of the stretches but I thought it was going to be a workout and it wasn't. The instructor just doesn't get much in for each ten minute segment and each section is so specialized that I thought it was kind of all over the place. I was looking forward to this one but I was disappointed.
5,Love this program,"I love this. If I need to relieve tension in one area of my body I simple choose the area and work through it on the DVD. Annette is easy to follow and the program is soooo doable. I am a big believer in stretching and don't want to become one of those individuals with ""forward head"" or rounded shoulders as I age. Very inexpensive and perfect in ten!"
3,"Virtuoso Performer, So-So tunes","Mr. Shimabukuro is every bit as incredible a musician as everyone says. However, I want to hear him, not a group, and I didn't find any of the songs memorable, or worth hearing again but for his playing. This version of ""While My Guitar..."" was particularly disapointing. I'll preview his other albums more carefully before purchasing."
4,"Neo, Electronic Tango!","Wonderfully fun. To hear tango with very different instruments and rhythms awakens the senses!My only complaint: Some of the selections at the very beginning are too similar. I was about to write it off as ""all the same"" when I was pulled into all-new realms of exploration.Enjoy!Kirtland Peterson"
5,Good Balance of Scholarship and Heart,"Hall does a great job of blowing the dust off these ancient writings and succinctly demonstrating why they are still very relavent even today. In addition to being a Patristic scholar, he is also a writer with the skill to make one feel like they are meeting in person the authors being studied. He also contrasts how the writings are to be understood in the context of the time they were written and the issues they tried to address. Without such insight one might think several of the writers directly contradict each other when they do not. An excellant read for even the beginner and highly recommended!"
4,Great Text Book Ecspecially for beginners,"As a beginner in hapkido i would recommend this book for others that are also interested in starting hapkido. This book offers step by step pictures on how to execute kicks and basic self defense, and plus it is very short on words which makes it interesting and easy to learn techniques."
5,"Wonderful story, a very open and vulnerable story-teller","I picked this book up purely on a hunch, having gone through my ""father-work"" a few years back. What a wonderful story. I read this book in 48 hours. I gave it to my wife, who rarely shares my literary taste, and she read it in 24 hours. Matousek is a very courageous and honorable story teller. I was rivited until the last page. All so human are the people in his life. He is honest about his rage...honest about his loss..and honest about his compassion. Highly recommended."
4,A very moving memoir,The cover drew me to this book--and the author has a comfortable writing style..even when what he writes about isn't that comfortable of a topic.
2,An Oversight or an Omission,"This strange history of Christianity either overlooks or omits all account of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity from the moment of origins through the medieval and modern periods. As a popularized history, it chooses not to delve deeply into theology, but it is strange that it offers nothing about the influence of religious, cultural, and social differences between Judaism and Jews, and Christianity and Christian on the history of the latter. This history of Christianity resembles what might have been the story of its past if the early Church had decided to omit the Holy Scriptures from the Bible and pretended that Jews ceased to exist after the Crucifixion."
1,"Useless utelsils, will crack when dry and can't be washed!","These utensils cant be washed in the dishwasher or submerged in the sink. So essentially you arent supposed to wash them or they will warp and then fall apart. I dont see the point in utensils you cant get wet!? I originally bought them because I like how bamboo is an environmentally sustainable material, and I do not like to use plastic. But these are just completely useless, and if you put too much pressure on them when they are dry they will just crack! Please do not buy these, they are only decoration and not real."
1,garbage,"like i said you win some you loose some this cd only one cut,the rest is garbage you know da la soul is the truth they was just trippen on this one from 0h10 again"
1,MP3 version: Warning! Don't buy!,"Disc 1, Track 11 sounds like an aria in German from a J. S. Bach Cantata. What is this doing on a recording of the Messiah? Transitions between tracks stutter. This cannot possibly be the same as the CD version."
5,GREAT!,"I really liked this product a lot, besides the fact that it has a cheesy MTV logo on it, though it's black and sort of blends in. I take this on trips all the time! It's wonderful! It holds my player and my CD wallet, which is small."
1,Black Elastic Eye Patch,"This black elastic eye patch is lined on the inside with black paper. The paper is what holds the shape. It worked well for about an hour, until perspiration soaked the paper. Then the patch would not hold its shape plus a slit opened from the center to the top allowing light to get through. After a few minutes,the patch collapsed and became totally useless. I might note that I only walked from my house to my car, drove for a few minutes and walked into another building. I was not physically working other than walking.This patch may be OK in Alaska, but it is of NO USE in Texas!"
5,Great Eye Patch,"For those days you are feeling like a pirate.Comfortable and gives you the urge to call out random great pirate lines like:""That's the finest pirate booty I've ever laid eyes on."""
5,it did it's job,nothing to say it did what it was meant to do.with out any problems. not really much else to say about it
3,Eye Patch,"This eye patch is as advertised. I have trouble with it though. I can still see with my bad eye, but it is not lined with my other eye making me see double. I bought this so I would have to hold one eye shut all the time. But since I still have vision in that eye, and even though it is black what I see, it still makes my vision not as good as when I just close that eye. Not the products fault, but fault with my vision."
3,Had to fix it,I could see a point of light through this so I broke out the super glue and was able to fix it. Didn't know until way after that I could have purchased this at a local retailer for cheap.
4,a good deal,"The eye patches arrived quickly, and were exactly what I was looking for. Simple, utilitarian eyepatches, and inexpensive. And they were exactly what my eye doctor recommended.Jim Flick"
2,it was alright for about 2 days,"The eye patch worked well for the first 2 days, but after that the band which keeps it on your head got stretched out and I had to tie a bandana over it to keep it up. It wasn't a good buy and I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this eye patch."
1,Small head,May be OK for little people or Halloween.It has a small elastic strap that is too small for my head. When stretched to use it looses its shape and touches the eyelid. It is not very rigid. So it's only suitable to keep breezes off the eye and a reminder to keep hands off.
2,Does the job...,"I use it for shooting since I am left eye dominant. Very cheap feel, don't know how long the strap is going to hold up. Should cost much less than the almost $5! More like a $1-2 filler product. That said though, the least expensive you'll find on Amazon."
2,Cheap,The way the eyepatch is stitched makes it form poorly. It's a decent patch but it looks so cheap that it might make your costume look cheap as well.
2,Not good,"It holds usually over the other eye as well, so it wasn't so great for using as costume. very uncomfortable"
1,What a piece of junk,"DO NO BUY THIS EYE PATCH. You have been warned, its a piece of junk. It does not hold its form at all. When you put the patch on it immediately collapses because there is zero support, its just fabric basically. Spend a little extra and you won't regret your purchase."
1,Not strong structure,"This patch is too soft, leaving no room for eyelashes, making it very uncomfortable to use and requires close the eye patched."
2,Not compatible with many Ford engines,"This is billed as a universal puller/installer, and if you go to OTC's website, you see it specifically listed as compatible with Ford's 4.0L V6 OHV engine. However, it actually isn't compatible when it comes to reinstalling the harmonic balancer. The problem is that Ford's 4.0L engine requires a very long M12 x 90 mm threaded bit in order to reach the crankshaft threads for reinstallation. OTC went cheapo and the M12 bit they provide is nowhere near long enough to catch any of the threads. I ended up just using the old balancer bolt to get the balancer on, and then I torqued in the new bolt. Very disappointing...the item is well made, but heck...there are how many million vehicles on the road that use Ford's 4.0L V-6, and OTC couldn't be bothered to give you a bit that was just 1 inch longer?"
1,Don't buy it,It takes way to long to pull the balancers off. Thread pitch is way too fine compared to others that we have used.
4,great item,this product was in great condition and very fast shipment.will definitly buy from this person in the future. thanks for the product
5,I Love This Show!,"Its awesome, funny, and sweet. And above all lessons she learns are lessons we all too could learn. Keep'em Coming Disney."
3,Hannah Montana Keeping it Real Review,"I bought this for my niece, and the movie was in perfect conditions, the story is for little girls only.It has subtitles in spanish. The transaction was so fast and the price was perfect."
3,Don't waste your money...,"If you already own all four of Brulé's albumsWe the People,Lakota Piano,One Nation, andStar People, then don't waste your money on this album. It consists only of selected tracks from those four albums, and no new material.Aside from that, the music on here is still very good. If you don't have all of Brulé's albums, this is a good choice. But you don't need this one if you already have all the others."
3,New Age-Like Native Music,"I am not a fan of any ""new age"" music and I didn't expect this band be so like new age - but this is what I got with the CD. The music is probably good if you like this style. Interestingly, Amazon said that others who purchased this music also purchased the ""Smoke Signals"" soundtrack. I don't think that these artists had much in common with that soundtrack at all but good luck to the band anyway."
1,Brule CD,"Sorry, just not my kind of music - typical pseudo-native indian repetitive chanting - just didn't do it for me."
3,Decent phone,"Owned the phone for 1 year, had to send it back once because the rocker button for the volume broke. It made some decent calls, HOWEVER BE CAREFUL OF THE FRONT SCREENS, THEY BREAK VERY EASILY. I know a couple people with this phone and they broke their screens as well."
4,Sexy Phone Cover,"The Cellet Stingray rubber cover has a good feel to it with a sleek and sexy look. Looks great on both the black and red SGH-A707. Seems better made than some other stingray covers my friends and I have used.A few cons, though. The top half of the cover, for the screen, is hard to remove for cleaning. Cut outs for the side buttons and ports do not line up, but don't completely hinder use of them. Since this cover is more for looks and screen protection, there is little impact protection."
3,Good all around cover,"The cell phone cover fits perfectly the A707 model. Like some other reviews the main complain is detaching the top half of the cover. Sometimes it sticks so much to the phones screen that you need a clip or some kind of help to carefully remove it, or you will damage it since the protective plastic is kind of sewed. Also the SD slot is not accessible with the bottom half of the cover on. There is no problem with the charging port. The side buttoms might no fit precisely perfectly, but they do not bother the functionality.I bought this cover being that those plastic covers will actually scratch your phone. The surface of this cover if a very nice kind of suede or soft cloth, so the phone sufers absolutely no scratches.In my final opinion is a very cheap functional cover."
1,"Not much of a movie, I had to skip thru it to avoid most the bad acting.",Not much redeeming value in this movie and I hope they made enough to pay for filming it. Unless you had time to waste or are really into the undead do not waste you time.
2,poor production values,"awful acting, direction, and plot development. This movie was clearly not mentioned for any awards on the year of production."
3,Decent zombie movie,"This movie has ""real"" zombies, i.e. they are really dead come back to life. It has Ken Foree from the original Dawn of the Dead and other horror movies (the Beyond, etc.). They use (mostly) Romero zombies; a personal positive preference. The effects are adequate. The one thing that will immediately pull you out of the movie, break your concentration, is the occasional TERRIBLE actor (one dr. is especially bad). It is overall watchable and a bit fun."
3,Okay,"Not the best zombie film I have seen, but by no means the worst. Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree back in a zombie apocalypse."
1,Tried to like it,"I couldn't finish it. I really really tried to. I was disappointed on so many levels that after a bit I was getting angry and wanted all the characters to die...maybe 10 minutes in. The poor attempt to make it a Rodriquez style film quality failed epically. Bad acting, average story, less than average filmography, very unlikable characters, even for a Zombie movie the development was tragic. I have reviewed very few films on any online database, Please remove this from all of them as it was just painful and bad. I cant even see this making it as a Jr High class project as some I've seen are much better."
3,It was Okay!!,"This movie started out really slowly. It took the main characters forever to figure out what was going on. They should have all been dead within the first 15 minutes of the movie. However, the action did pick up especially towards the end."
3,one of those movies,Length:: 1:29 Minsthis is one of those movies that your have to watch to see if you like it or not u cant really depend on reviews
1,I love zombies but not this movie,"Terrible movie, bad acting. I could not even watch the whole movie. I fell asleep it was so bad. Plot doesnt even make sense."
3,Big zombie fan here...however,"there are production issues with this film, (bad lighting on more than a few occasions; sound recording could have been just a bit better), but for the dollar amount they may have been working with, I think they did an OK job. I did watch most of the movie, just for the record. It was on Amazon Prime FREE rental, so the price was right. Had I paid to watch this, I'd have a different attitude. Dec 16, 2013"
2,Bad acting maybe due to a bad voiceover,"I think many reviewers didn't notice that this is a dubbed voice over, causing a mediocre acting to become bad acting. Just keep that in mind and it's still an enjoyable b-rated film."
3,WTF!?! It was free and I want my money back!!!,"Ok... I normally do not write reviews for movies I have not seen all the way through, but here I will make an exception!!! So I got through the first four minutes alive... was even impressed with the idea of the virus discovery in the old grave... THEN the acting started.Was it really that bad?Well... remember the acting in Ed Wood??? That was better!""Don't go to the ooooold bender place!!!"" PRETTY BAD!!!!The best actor was the Wino on the bench who didn't say anything!!!! or even move!The young station guard sealed it. Must have been related to someone and I was just waiting for him to look directly at the camera as he spoke his four lines with an ear-slitting grin! If it gets better than this I would be surprised, but I for one do not have enough medication to watch such dribble! And I LOVE ""BAD"" movies. Chock this as a good cover art scam and save two hours of your lives for better things!Good luck and good watching! You'll need it!"
3,Zombies Zombies Zombies,"OK I got to watch this movie last night and I thought it was pretty good. Not one of the greatest Zombie Flicks but better than a lot of others ones that have been made before it & since. It was a low budget movie and some of the actors needed lessons while others were really good. Ken Foree from the original Dawn of the Dead honestly was just awful his in this movie I cannot see why he got so much praise. The one guy in the movie who was the best was the Mental Patient Lunatic called Armageddon he was a total Bad ass going around killing anything while quoting Biblical quotes!Again I enjoy a good zombie movie and this was enjoyable, so don't listen to all the bad reviews about it."
2,Seemed like a soap opera at times!,"I thought this movie might be something interesting but I have to admit I was very disappointed. The acting was amateurish, bland and emotionless! 45 minutes into the film I fell asleep! I'm really surprised that Ken Foree took on this role. He was great in Dawn of the Dead! This totally sucked.I gave it two stars because I felt the zombies were good. This could have been an exciting film considering they had the best atmosphere to do it in, but I could never care for any of the characters or really get involved in the film. What a waste!"
3,"Repackaged, but enjoyable.","Well, this is a repackaging of ""Zone of the Dead"" from 2009.Let me say this film was good, and Ken Foree turned in good performance.There were a number of references to the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" of 1978, also with Ken Foree.For a foreign zombie movie it was pretty good."
2,Acting is poor,"The idea that some secret development using the Bubonic Plague virus went out of control was fine. Then the zombie theme is the same as every other zombie movie and that is don't get bit and shoot 'em in the head.I do not mind watching a good zombie flick even if it is the same theme but when the acting is as wooden as it is in this movie, then I have a problem of keeping my attention in the movie.I made it about half through the movie and then I had to give this one up as dead on arrival acting and it was never going to get any better for this movie.Don't bother to see this thing. It is too bad the zombies could not have gotten ahold of the director and script writer before they were able to get this movie to market."
1,The zombies should have eaten this one before it was released.,"Lame copy cat of a genre that is being beaten to death (no pun intended). Found myself fast forwarding through most of it. Acting stinks with a predictable plot line. The zombies should have eaten this one before it was released. Right up there with ""Autumn""."
2,Could have been worse,The Pros:Lots of zombiesLots of hot chicksLots of gunsThe Cons:Horrible dialogHorrible actingHorrible continuityLacked nudityLacked swearing
1,Boring and Horrible (don't trust teaser!),"Both my nephew and I are into zombie films. We've seen a lot of good one and not-so-good. This one we rated as one of the worst. It's is poorly filmed, has a bad script and generally sucks. The only thing was these zombies move fast, and that we like. Don't trust the teaser for this film. We did and, boy, what a disappointment."
1,Wow,"I watched 5 minutes and had to turn it off... it's hard to explain how terrible this is that I knew what it was within five minutes, but believe me, there's a visceral knowledge that comes with being a movie buff like I am after 40 years, I love horror, I love all genres, classics and modern, and I knew right away, this was one to miss."
3,"Whats another way of saying ""When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the Earth""","From the start we are presented with a film that screams LOW BUDGET. I am not even sure how they managed to get the beloved Ken Foree, but that is clearly where the budget went. The screenplay definitely did not fit the cost range of the film, it could have been much better if it was written with the budget in mind and maybe some creativity. What we get is a a little bit of zombie action and that is all. One huge setback was the corny acting, specifically the religious soldier who walks around talking to himself as he slays the undead in a calm and collected fashion. There are actually some slightly humorous moments and even a couple nods back to the original Dawn of the Dead.True zombies fans will get some of the lines in this movie, including Foree's character saying ""When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the Earth"" just in a different way.This is only a rental, do NOT buy this one!"
3,"Heard it before, needs less descriptions and more plots.","There has to be a beginning, middle and an end to a short story. I found plenty of imagination, but lacking the horror that I expected. Not finding the ending or missing the middle of the stories can be corrected along with the over-abundance of commas. Some stories seemed sexual so that was a turnoff for a horror short story. Grammar was so so, and some of the storylines seemed familiar; a three star rating for this short story is generous. Where was the macabre or the nightmares? I can see how this style of writing can appeal to some readers but not this reader."
1,This dude is a Space Cadet!,"O.K. Maybe some of his other books are alright, but this one is the ""Bermuda Triangle"" of description. He comes out of nowhere and leads you around for awhile giving ALOT of useless information on the way things look, feel, act, smell, etc. etc. Most of the stories have maybe an inkling of horror to them....but that's about it. The rest are just frolics in la la land and a trip around in a void. Yes, description is important to give the reader an insight into who, what, where, when, and why. But come on! I don't enjoy reading for forty minutes about a door in some dark alcove with light just dusting the outer edgesgiving a faint impression of the promise of a voyage into an abyssmal beyond. Just get me through the darn door and let's go from there! Jeez!"
5,A Great Collection from the Best Weird Fiction Writer Alive!,"This is a collection of three books from Thomas Ligotti: ""Songs of a Dead Dreamer"", ""Grimscribe"", & ""Nocuary. It also contains some unpublished material to form Part 4. This is absolutely the most authenticly frightening and ingenius collection I have ever read. Ligotti is without a doubt the best weird fiction author alive today! I won't go into the details because I'm sure others have already done it (better than I can); but I will say this: if you are considering buying a Ligotti book, buy this one! It contains a good portion of his work and it's super-cheap! You will not be disappointed! Be sure to pick up ""My Work Is Not Yet Done"" after you've finished this one..."
4,Good portrayal of a rich boy and his escape from his past,"Sheila Weller provided a fair portrayal of Alex Kelly, his town, and his crimes. She provided the details with objectivity and still provided the reader with an enjoyable read. I do not believe Darien, the town Alex Kelly grew up in, was unfairly represented. The town and the environment played a key role in Kelly's development and although it is not responsible for its actions, it is one of the more important aspects to his crimes."
3,Unfair portrayal,"I thought the book was good, there was no doubt about that, but I found some unfairness in her story telling.I have family members who live in Darien, Connecticut and I found Ms. Wellers words quiteharsh. There are many towns in the US that are wealthy and protective just like Darien. I feel like Ms. Weller has singled out all the parents of Darien and accused them of not rearing their children with good morals and values. Unfortunately, this is not the 50's anymore and children will do what and how they please. It is not necessarily the parents, as much as it is the media that teaches our children less than appropriate behavior.I cannot comment on"
4,One of the sickest books of all time,"Ed Lee is the mogul of madness... the tycoon of terror... the baron of bloodbaths... the, well, you get what I mean. This has got to be -- without question -- one of the sickest, most repulsive books ever written. That's both a good and a bad thing. The good thing is that it's a novella, so it's a fairly quick read. It's a solid story with some surprising depth behind it. The bad part is that a lot of the story seems to be a showcase of how gross the authors can get. It almost feels like a competition between the two authors to see who can come up with a more disgusting scene. At times, things are so ridiculous, I just had to laugh at this nonstop freakshow. This book is not for everyone, but if you can stomach some truly hardcore horror, give this a try. It's certainly an eye-opener."
1,ugh,"I didn't get past the first few pages of this book. It was not as advertised. I read another book by this author and, though I thought it was at best remedial, I decided to give him another chance. He doesn't get any better. Yes, I knew the book had a sexual component but I was hoping he had included a plot. My hopes were dashed."
2,Dirty and sick,"but with a premise that could be interesting and in fact seemed so up to half of the book.The second half of the book completely destroys the sense there could be in the novel, what with the ease everything is sorted out and good beats bad, and the appearance of "" the monster"". The quest of a very crazy person should have continued a quest and not give rise to the appearance of "" things""....A read and throw away book."
4,"Pretty gross, even for Lee","As a long time horror fan I have pretty much read it all, and as a long time Edward Lee fan nothing really shocks me anymore. I started sneaking my mother's horror paperbacks to school when I was 11 years old, which means I have now read over 30 years worth of horror novels (gasp!)In all those years, and all those novels, this is the only book that ever made me gag. And I do mean, I literally gagged, and thought for a moment I was actually going to toss my cookies. If that was the reaction Lee was going for, well kudos to you Mr. Lee."
5,Insane,"This is an insane book, I really have no words. You should get this if you like any sort of weird and offensive things that make you think."
1,Do not read this!!!!!,"I can handle some weird things, but this book is sick. It's the kind of book rapist and serial killers like. Only read the first 15 pages and I was nauseous and angry at the same time. To talk about raping nuns and people with down syndrome and deformed people is wrong. I use to like Edward Little but now I'm done with his books!HORRIBLE"
3,OK,"This product is ok. this cd case is nice-looking and doesnt scratch your cd's, but, i dont know if this is just an individual flaw or if they are all like this, but when you open the cd case in what you would think is the right way it is upside down. i had to start mine backward! and the zipper isn't as durable as i think i would like it. but it holds cds without scratching them and is cool!"
4,Motion Systems,I have always had good luck with motion systems. Their products are very durable. I am glad I have motion systems.
3,Not good enough to finish,"At first, this was a fun game -- not too challenging (I tend to like 'em easy!), a good interface, excellent graphics and an entertaining story line. But after a while, the ""go here ... then go back there to get the whazzit you need ... then go there ... go back"" routine got old (particularly with all the CD swapping you have to do to transverse ""times."" Why is it the item you need in location 1 is always found in location 3 ... which requires a CD swap!!!In addition, you have to change ""chameleon"" identities several times and talk to the same people again and again.I did enjoy ""Arthur"" but the fun went out of it after a while."
2,Journey Man 1 was better,"I know this version of Journey Man has cool graphics and is suppose to be more up-to-date but I did not like it. The voice of that little guy in the corner(authur) of the screen is so Annoying. The story plot is like for little kids. Very simple like. In additon this game is not supported with a sound blaster sound card. The sound sounds all jarbelled up. I think that this is a great game for little kids but for teens or adults, Myst, Zork, Riven, or any other adventure game is better."

3,sink mat,"This product is o.k. I would prefer to have the original rubber mats like before but, this will do as replacement. It doesn't have the cushion that the rubber mats had. I do like the middle of the mat that you can lift to retrieve the sink plug without taking the whole mat out. I wish they would make them in different colors to match the kitchen. I enjoy the fact that I can get them online now and not have to run around looking for them."
3,dunno,Ordered and received. I haven't had a chance to use it yet so quit bugging me to write a review.
4,"Excellent, if a bit of an oddity","These are true 'Art songs', Japanese Lieder, and I'm not sure that many Japanese would be familiar with these songs which are some distance from classical folk songs like Esashi oiwake. Mera's voice of course is exemplary, and credit to BIS for including the full Japanese sung texts (in Japanese script), along with accurate English translations."
4,A wonderful performer,"This performer has a terrific range. His voice, lyrical and ingenious.By far, my favorite piece is Uguisu (Nightingale). I was really floored by it.I do agree, the piano can be overpowering in places. It is unclear whether it is the player or recording that is at fault.The album can be slow in places, but overall is a very satisfying and peaceful experience."
4,Great Music If Familiar Vocals,"Some may be put off by the obvious influences of Bob Dylan,Tom Waits, Nick Cave and Benjamin Smoke on Joe Pena's vocal stylings. But others will find this equally attractive, especially as the music that accompanies Pena's singing is similar -- particularly with Dylan's later albums -- and just as good. It could even be argued that the music on this disc is better and more solid in quality than most of these artist's output. If you are fans of any of them, you really deserve to check Greyhound Soul out!"
5,Great Instructional Freestyle DVD,This video has great underwater filming which is key in explaining the different styles of freestyle. My daughter Jessica (Age Group Swimmer) found this video very helpful in deciding which style of freestyle works best for her in certain races. I highly recommend this video for anyone who is serious about swimming.
4,If Virgil were British...,"If Virgil were British, this is what he would have sounded like. Much praise must be give to John Dryden for this accomplishment. For our translator has managed to tune to the Latin lyre to the beat of English metre. These fine and artful heroic rhyming couplets are without a doubt a manifestation of the aesthetic potential of the English language. This edition is preferred above all others, with the exception of Allen Mandelbaum's rendering, which is without rhyme and without rival in the arena of Virgilian translation."
4,"Great for planning, with interesting information","In planning a Scotland trip, I needed at least one resource to show me all of my options in pictures. The Eyewitness has some great photographs, as well as overviews on the culture, geography, etc. I used it as a start for my planning, but will not be taking it with me. This is not the book to purchase for lodging and transportation planning. But it served my purposes well, and seeing many of the sites and their locations helped me plan our itinerary.Along with a book like this, I recommend purchasing an extensive travel guide with lodging and transportation options (Let's Go and others). Also, internet research can be a great help, as can a detailed road atlas."
5,top scots,"Scotland isn't just hills and glens, whiskey tours and giant tartan tourist trap. This guide book will introduce readers to the ``reel'' scotland, where the east coast is revealed in all its craggy glory, dotted with castles and sheer cliffs plunging into the north sea, while the gulf stream buffets the west coast, leaving palm trees and tropical plants. The book takes on the nation's bloody history and even delights in the food, making haggis sound deliciously tempting."
5,"Smart, sophisticated, down-home music","I was lucky enough to catch The Seldom Scene live at their appearances at the Bluegrass Festival in Lexington, Ky. In the 1980s they were already the band that all the other bluegrass groups aspired to be.This collection of their work on Rebel Records is a treasure. The tracks date from 1973-1976. Besides the title track ""Different Roads"" this compilation includes ""Old Train"", ""Reason for Being"" and ""Pan American""--which is a nostalgia trip for a travel agent in more ways than one.The voices sound so young and fresh. John Starling is the lead vocal on most of the cuts, but John Duffey's tenor on ""Reason for Being"" is worth the whole purchase price.Although these songs come from three different albums, the grouping is cohesive. This whole album works for me. And oh, that dobro with Mike Auldridge's baritone vocals...""Last Train From Poor Valley"", ""Wait A Minute""--and ""Old Train"". Mellow energy in a CD."
4,Narcissistic Need and Entitlement Deprivation,"My first reading of this book was not very good; however, wondering why I felt this way, I immediately went back to review the contents of this book.Realistically and honestly considered, I was not prepared for what I was reading; and then, ""IT"" dawned on me...I was reading about my own family experience...which means I was reading about myself and my own psychology of being.This Jungian-styled book turned out to be an excellent introductory book for me, and will be remembered by me as the pivotal work that led me into the field of Heinz Kohut's work on Narcissism and Self Psychology...a field I was completely unaware of personally."
2,Narcissism and Character Transformation:The Psychology of Narcissistic Character Disorders,"The book has an excellent definition of Narcissism and a map for the almost impossible treatment of the narcissist. The book's flaw is quite simply THE BOOK DOES NOT DEAL WITH THE TOXIC LEGACY OF THE NARCISSIST IN THE LIVES OF OTHERS. This book should only be bought as a companion with a book like ""Coping with Infuriating, Mean,Critical People: The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern"" by Nina W. Brown. Another companion book might be ""The Object of My Affection is in My Reflection; Coping with Narcissists"" by Rokelle Lerner. It is sad that the author seems almost oblivious to the wreckage the narcissist creates in the lives of others. The one-sided perspective of this book is unfortunate."
3,The Obfuscating Myth,"Schwartz-Salant is one of the most thought-provoking Jungians around. He continues and extends Jung's archetypal narratives by exploring deeper links with alchemy, mythology, and other psychodynamics and object relations schools of psychology. In this book, he uses Greek mythology as an exegetic (interpretative) framework to gain clinical insights. This is not such a good idea and resorting to Kohut's work does not counter-balance this deficiency. Greek mythology is limited both by its set of characters and their interactions and by its cultural context. That it is a finished work - cast in the stone of history - makes it static and unable to cope with the dynamics of the hydra of pathological narcissism. A colourful intellectual exercise - but of very litlle clinical use, I am afraid. Sam Vaknin, author of ""Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited""."
3,Want remaining episodes!,"These VOD/DRM files will not play on many devices, including my WD HD TV LIVE media player, so this only gets three stars.It's nice to have access but still want the rest of the episodes and would like to play them on the TV and not just the computer.There are total of 65 episodes.Please provide them.Preferably the complete set on DVD."
3,"I love Dinosaucers, but I don't love this download.","Dinosaucers=good.The quality of the cartoons is ok, but you need WMP and Amazon's player to view them. The content gets 5 stars, the videos themselves (and the playback method get 1.) You get my average of 3."
2,"Great cheeseball cartoon, terrible downloads.","Dinosaucers: A terribly cheesy cartoon from the late 80s that you had to be there to love. 5 stars for anthro dinosaurs.Sadly, this download is terrible. 640x480, noisy old videos that look like they were duped right from 3/4"" tape found in the junk bin at a UHF station, with enough interlacing artifacts to choke a small horse. To boot, you get a crapload of DRM, WMP11 (Anyone really still use this joker of a program?) and the not-needed service installing Amazon player. As soon as I am done with these videos, all of that crap gets uninstalled.My first, and last download. Bet these can be stripped of DRM :)Edit: Hey Sony, I know you're busy trying to figure out how the hax0rs are pwning you so hard, but hey. Put these out on DVD - all of them! - and I'll buy them."

1,Plastic not rubber,I was trying to replace old Hogue rubber grips for my S&W and tought from the description that this was the same.These are cheap plastic grips. Not rubber. Not happy.
3,GIGANTOR!!! LIVE ACTION!! JUST OK!!,Yes its Just OK. I didn't think this was a sbad as the other reviews. But atleast the video quality is good. If you are thinking about buying the ULTRAMAN vol.1 from BCI. Dont buy it. It sucks. Buy Tetsugin 28 the movie instead.
2,Boring,"I had an opportunity to see this movie at the 2005 New York Asian Film Festival, and it was really bad. I had no prior exposure to the long history of Tetsujin 28 (Gigantor), and I thought at the very least that it would be a decent kaiju (giant monster) movie.Essentially, the little boy as a main character is totally uninteresting, and there just isn't that much action in the movie. I can't imagine that it would hold a child's attention, and I was certainly bored as well.Unless you are a huge Tetsujin fan, avoid this one."
3,THE ORIGINAL GIANT ROBOT.,"Gigantor as us americans know him stars in his own feature film.A japanese creation known as Tetsujin 28 this film brings me back to the days when the trans-lux cartoon played on UHF stations and I would bearly get reception.It's a cool flick and the cg work holds up,I only wish there was more robot battles.The Black Ox an evil robot is Tetsujin's nemises who appeared in the cartoon series.Worth a peek especially if your a fan of the Gigantor series.The dvd is in japanese with english subtitles."
5,"Hard, but great!","Cathe truly delivered on this DVD! The first time I did it I was sore for days! It has been over a month now of doing it once a week, still get sore a little, but it does get a little easier each time. Love all her gym style workouts!"
5,Can hardly walk,"I have a love/hate relationship with this workout. I love it because I know it is working and I can barely walk for two days after but I dread doing it when leg day rolls around because it is long and challenging. I still have yet to finish all of the calf raises, there are so many!"
5,Headhunter,"I first heard this band in 1982 when the Headhunter album came out and I loved every song. To me at the time this is what heavy metal was all about. Loud vocals, heavy guitars and killer drums"
5,bonecrunching!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is the best krokus album to date the first and only to have steve pace behind the drum kit ,it will basically stand up to any ac-dc recording,storaces vocals are perfect the band are all in time there is no mediocre song here no filler all killer if you dont own this gem well you better this is a masterpeice!!!"
3,The Swiss AC/DC,"A decent release of this Swiss (my compatriots) heavy metal band. They remind me of AC/DC, and in their finest moments rival them. But often the playing is too fast! I recommend Axel Rudi Pell. He's just as heavy but replaces speed by skill. As to melody behind the shredding both Krokus and AC/DC can't compete."
4,Headhunter Review,"Krokus is, surprisingly, a pretty obscure band that never really got the recognition it deserved. There are many classic metal songs on here such as Headhunter, Screaming in the Night, and Eat the Rich. This album should be known by all people who think they know metal."
4,No Doubt A Classic!!,By far Krokus' best album. Not commercial in the slightest!! Every metal band has an album that shines....this is it for Krokus.
5,"An update from a former band member, Lydia","Thank you so much for your interest in this album!To answer those of you who have wondered where the band members are now and what they are doing... Bering Strait is no longer together, but you'll be pleased to know that everyone is still in the United States and still pursuing music, to varying degrees - as solo artists, studio musicians and/or road musicians. So the journey continues.If you're curious to check out my debut solo album ""Hallway"", you can clickhere. Or, for more information about it, and to download a free live performance mp3, please visit my official website, LydiaSalnikova.com."
3,Bering Strait drifting aimlessly,"When I heard Bering Strait's first album (Bering Strait), they instantly became one of my favorite bands. The concept of classically-trained Russian singers doing country music was fantastic and the songs were original and had a tremendous energy to them. I keenly anticipated the release of this second album, Pages. However, I was rather disappointed by it. I think the songs have different writers from the songs on the first album, and they vary wildly in genre, from Russian folk to jazz to rock, sometimes all in one track. Each song is enjoyable enough, but none sticks in the mind as a hit. Also, the atmosphere is rather downbeat. Instrumentals go on too long. This album is not going to keep me awake on long road trips across Alaska, unfortunately."
1,Cannot believe how bad this is....what a mistake by them.,"I really liked their debut album and was hoping this 2nd CD would have them growing on their first. Unfortunately, this CD just plain old stinks. I had to skip several tracks to find anything that resembled the first CD. There is maybe one or two ok tracks on this CD but the rest is torture. I think this band is talented and it is sad that they would throw out a CD of this quality. Oh well, I have a new drink coaster."
2,"OK, but not nearly as good as their first","I wasn't thrilled with this CD and I was a huge fan of their first, which I listened to a lot. I still listen to that one and never listen to the second one. Strange, because I love all music except classical and opera, and have about 4-5000 CD's in my music library. This one just didn't do it for me. It's just too mellow & blah...no bite.They are all very talented musicians, however, and I'll buy their next one."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE.,I like there first cd better then this. It is well played but does not go down as easy as the first one.... will this cd grow on me maybe..? But think there first effort was more exciting this one lack's some spark or freshness.
2,I had expected more...,"Their first album was great so when I found ""pages""I was expecting more of the happiness and strengththat I could feel from their first album.It's really only in ""moroz-moroz"" that I can recognizethem and their wonderful vocalist.So, if You are reading this, please dont play it safe,there are so many wonderful russian ballads that Youcould bring out in a new shape, try to go back to thecrazy original kids that we really love.regards/peter"
4,A fine compliment for the study of Spanish.,"The only problem I have here is with the need to constantly be flipping back and forth in the book so as to see the proper pronunication guide for words.Having said that, it's still a really good book for the building up of a good basic vocabulary of Spanish."
5,Great idea,"Never thought of buying a filter online, but it is really good to do so. Same filter thats at a auto shop, but half the price"
5,The Best Animated Comic...EVER,"I heard about this animated series from a group of friends. They said it was ""cutting-edge"", ""inspiring"", ""motivational"", and ""the funniest thing they've ever seen"".After watching it, I couldn't put the DVD down. The characters are awesome. And Bumpie coming back as a 'roach'...hilarious!!!Eveyone should buy this for their collection."
3,Street-smart comedy doesn't dissapoint!,"I've followed OJ online for a while now and was psyched to find all the episodes collected on a DVD. Anthony's writing style is smart & edgy with the right balance of laugh-out-loud funny and jokes that dawn on you two minutes later. He manages to slip wry social & political observations in the mix without missing a beat.The animation is pretty simplistic but it suits the style of the comedy just fine. Terence Anthony (creator) said in an interview that he's really a writer and learned to use Flash to bring his OJ scripts to life. I'd love to see where this toon would go if Anthony were paired with a professional animator. I could see OJ continuing as an underground phenomenon or getting picked up by a network and expanded.Even if you've seen the episodes online (they are not all available on the website anymore), the extras on the DVD are well worth the purchase. The web cam episode with Orlando and the 2-Bit video are HILARIOUS!!"
4,Good product for the money,Might not last long if you live in a windy area but nice color and strong brass grommets. all in all a good flag
5,happy,I bought 2 of these: 1 for my husband and 1 for his brother....we will take them with us when we go camping and fly them proudly!!
1,Photo does not represent product.,You think you are getting the square mirror but you are shipped a large rounded one.
3,Imperialism II - a review,"I, like many other Imperialism II owners, was brought to the series by the original Imperialism, which, undoubtedly, remains one of my favorite games. However, I do not think the sequel lives up to its predecessor. The second game got rid of some of the most amusing parts of the original. For example, the Industry screen in Imperialism II is bland and uninteresting, and, in my opinion, the addition of emplacerd artillery to the game, however realistic, took away from the enjoyability of playing by making it a little too hard to take land early in the game. And what happened to the wonderful scenarios? The second game, even with its change of setting, is too like the original in my opinion. Granted, designing a game sequel that combines the best of the original while also adding new ideas is hard, but from the team that created Imperialism, it is expected."
4,FORGOTTEN GEM!,"Found it in an unpacked box I had in storage, for how long? ..But the game installs and plays perfect on Windows 7, and you can still download the 1.3 patch.."
5,a really interesting game,it's a great game filled with suspence and excitement.When you play this game you never know what could happen.Hang on to your seats
5,a really cool game,it's a great game filled with suspence and excitement.When you play this game you never know what could happen.Hang on to your seats.P.s. I know my boyfriend would really love it!
3,The Eisenhower White House Years,"This volume, along with the later volume WAGING PEACE, comprise President Dwight Eisenhower's Presidential memoirs. It does appear to be written by committee much more than his CRUSADE IN EUROPE, which describes his military activities during World War II and is rightly a classic. Yet is offers an invaluable perspective of this very misunderstood time in American history from the vantage point of the Oval Office. Rather than the bland or conformist image many of us have, this was actually a very eventful period, covering the Korean War, the heating up of the Cold War, the rise and fall of Joseph McCarthy and the landmark school segregation decisions of the United States Supreme Court."
4,One might consider this album Le Bomb.,"The French Acedemia has just recently decided that Rap is a legitimate art form. Dee Nasty decided this years ago and proves it on this album. The tempos are fast and energetic, the poetry seamless, and they don't forget to pay tribute to the Old School New York academia. A few of their tracks have an acid-jazz or even dance tip however, and seem filler for an otherwise exciting French Rap album."
4,Just the thing,"Arrived quickly, case holding cds was cracked, but cds ok. would buy again. They are hard to find in the stores."
5,Hard to fine sizes for Playtex bra was easy to fine on line.,This bra is my go to bra. Fits great with perfect support for big sizes. I like the fact it has thin material with reinforcement that works great. Please don't ever drop this product.
3,Platex Secret Underwire Bras,"While the Platex Women's Secrets Signature Floral Underwire bra that I ordered is lumpy, it more or less fits. It's a shame that Playtex had to discountinue their very popular and well fitting LACE underwire bra, #4233. So far, I haven't been able to find the same kind of bra made by another manufacturer. Not all of us can wear the formed and/or padded ones that all the companies are making as we are not all still in our teens. Some company out there should come up with Bras that fit."
3,not for me,too wide around so the straps fall off. other brands don't do that. odd.sizing i think. not the sender's fault nor the maker. just needs a wider rib cage person LOL
2,Think Twice,"I bought this bra because it looked study and seemed it would hold up well; it doesn't. The material is flimsy, the underwire bunches in the middle at the top and pokes out, the cups were too big in the front and came up short on the sides. Not worth the price. Why two stars? I liked the color."
5,Best Journal I found,"It is a shame to find that this book is out of print. My close friend and I have filled 4-5 of these between us, and often look back to them to predict our luck fishing, on any given day. The book provides plenty of room to jot down all pertinent information, and if you caught a species that is not listed, there is a usefull 'other' box. I hope to find a replacement soon, since mine are all filled up."
2,A bit of a jumble,"What a great topic, and what a promising title. Sadly, though, the authors are never able to draw tight the numerous strands they attempt to follow through the book, with the result that it seems at the end to be a hodgepodge of anecdote and heaped-up observation contributing nothing to a cogent argument. What is even sadder is that given the current state of academic publishing in this country, this is likely to be the only work published on the subject for a long time."
4,Theories on Cinema,"This is not a how to for wannabe movie directors, the essays revolve around the cinematic medium and its creation, and not so much on its content. Not unlike McLuhan, Eisenstein proposes to understand cinema as an extension of our senses ( hence, his following book, Film Sense ), and retraces the evolution from theather to cinema to sound cinema with a focus on Japanese influence ( Kabuki ) and a revolutionary ( for its time ) approach to montage. Cryptic at times, but a goldmine of insights into the nature of the silver screen."
3,THIS BOOK WILL NOT IMPROVE YOUR FILMMAKING,"This book will not improve your skills as a filmmaker (I doubt that any book would). If you can actually figure out what Eisenstein is trying to say, you will only find very vague and obscure theories. His ideas are interesting in what they reveal about his films and himself, but you cannot apply them to your filmmaking."
1,No plug??,"We were so excited to use this pool, but half way thru filling it with air, we realized there was no plug to empty the water. Bailing out that much water with buckets was not an option. so sad:("
4,Really a rather fun film.,"I don't know why others found this boring or distastful, but I found it rather fun. It was obvious that those who they interviewed in this film were knowledgeable to some extent in the ways of music theory. To hear them disect part by part one of the most interesting and original scores Pink Floyd ever produced was a treat. Also the historic angle was extemely interesting. If you have ever seen the live concert in San Francisco of the raw unorchestrated version of the piece, you will understand how someone needed to breath a new context into the music. I was impressed with Ron Geesin and now fully understand why I was so shocked when I had first heard the album so many years ago. Also as to the rough footage of rare concert material it was not a distraction. We should be lucky that these remnants of film are still around. Worth seeing for any musician or music lover."
2,Disappointing,"You'd think that for $26 you would get a live performance of the show. They did it in NYC, with ballet dancers, and was covered by Time magazine. There must be a video recording of it.Otherwise, a lot of of interesting details about the projects and one of my favorite PF efforts. Hungry for anything PF, I enjoyed watching it, but as I said, to have a critical review without seeing the subject is highly disappointing. And the price for a TV documentary is outrageous."
1,really bad!,needless to say more; read the previous reviews and believe them. I didn't... and wasted money!!
1,WARNING FLOYD FAN: DO NOT BUY THIS!,"""In-Depth research""? PFFFTTT!!!!!!! A 5-year old can write a better review.This is the worst thing about my fave band there possibly ever is... The songs are not remastered, they didn't mention my fave songs off AHM (Summer '68 and If), and ir dosent have the tour. The only good part is the cow animation.I hope Pink Floyd sue the people who made this crappy DVD."
4,The Roots that Bind us all,"Different Trees from the Same Root, a novel by one Cheril Clarke is the type of book that pulls you in from the first sentence. Even if you have not read the first book in the series, Foundations, you can easily pick this book up as if this is not a continuation of the first book.A very spiritual book, the author invites you into a world told from the perspective of four different characters, Journey, Walter, Christina, and Rachel, each with certain obstacles that they must get pass in order for their life to be complete."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this CD because of the stellar recommendations it's received from several reviewers whose opinions I value. I was very disappointed. The playing and singing are spectacular and the recorded sound is superb, but the tempos destroy the work for me. I felt like I had inadvertently put an LP record on at 78 rather than 33, and I'm not averse to brisk tempos. Were they really this hyper in the 18th century?"
5,Phenomenal! Finally!,"Years ago I had a cassette recording of the Bach Magnificat from the Musical Heritage Society. It was a spectacular performance and I don't remember the artists--but it caused me to fall in love with the piece. The tape eventually went bad, and ever since I have tried to find a recording of the Magnificat to equal that one; I've bought three and always been disappointed--too heavy, too sluggish, too boring, no real music-making. Then I heard THIS ONE on the radio--it brought me to tears of joy. It surpasses the one I was trying to replace, so I bought it right right away. Yes, the tempi are off-the-wall, but wonderfully so. The soloists, and I believe the entire singing ensemble is only the five solosits, are beautifully clear, expressive, and musically energized. In the instrumentation, I continually am amazed to hear figures popping out that I've never heard in this piece before. And the individual contrapuntal lines are clear as can be. Get it!"
2,misleading title,"this book is very very basic, most of what is covered ( software current cameras etc.)will be out of date soon. do not expect to learn anything regarding taking better pictures ( shutter speed , mastering the light meter , etc. ). if you have absolutly no idea of how - what or why regarding digital cameras then this book is for you , but if you have any knowledge then pass up on this book"
2,A basic guide,"I must admit that the book title had me fooled. The cover looked stunning and I believed that this would be a book that would, indeed, help one to engage deeply in digital photography.However, the book turned out to be little more than a basic primer on getting started in digital photgraphy. In fact, it didn't go into sufficient detail on anything and, despite the excellent paper stock and beautiful color photographs, was an extremely disappointing buy."
4,"Good for it's time, but Outdated.","Peter K. Burian's MASTERING DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND IMAGING was almost outdated before it hit the bookstore shelves. This is a transition book with many of the features we now take for granted explained in terms of film equipment. The changes was rapid, but a major factor was cost and processing. Why wait when you can shoot as many shots as you want and delete the badies.A good look at the past, but of limited interest to the current reading public.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I admire the Renovare organization and think their Spiritual Formation Edition of the Bible is spectacular. Maybe that's why my hopes were too high for this study guide. It is very cerebral and dry. I agree that a deep understanding of Scripture is important, but I also would hope that there would be a more practical, direct approach to learning from Jesus than is presented here. Most of the exercises and ""lessons"" are very internal and academic. The early chapters in particular seem more oriented towards learning ""about"" Jesus than learning how to live your life from him. With all the best intentions, I believe this workbook to be too narrow and not ""beginner"" friendly."
5,Best and easiest workout ever!,"I love this workout, very easy to do. I actually look forward to doing it and I feel like I have accomplished something every time I work out. I feel stronger everyday! In 1 month of 2 workouts a day, people already notice the difference.. Joyce Vedral is a genius! I love the way she figured it out! My friends are buying the book and working out too. Anybody can do this workout."
3,Not their best,"I have enjoyed Shaman's Dream for awhile. However this offering was less than what they can actually do. Not bad, but not great either. Missed the vocals of previous releases. The Spirit that was part of their other works was missing here. We were left with only music. Maybe next time."
4,All you need to know about Butterflies,"This is a handy pocket guide for butterflies. It is useful for people who wish to know more about these insects , how to identify them. an essential handbook during butterfly watching.Each Butterfly type and species is enhanced with much information like its living conditions, sex, scientific names, significant physical characteristics and colours. Full pictorial interpretation makes it easy to read and comprehensive for all to use instantly.Well organised and chronlogically formatted to help users to locate the species of butterflies with ease by their classification by their families type.A must have for the butterfly lovers."
1,this is not the item discriped above,the item says its Corsair 2GB PC8500 1066Mhz at latencies of 5-5-5-15 instead i get a PC6400 800Mhz at latencies 4-4-4-12...i'm returning this
1,Amazon sends 2 x 1024 sticks not 2 x 2048,"""2X2GB Kit""""TWIN2X2048""Twice in the same product name this ram is listed as two times 2048.How does this add up to only 2 sticks of 1024 ram?If I stretch my imagination I could see a small chance that this is misleading naming at the best.But it has to be a mistake right?The packaging says ""2GB . 2 x 1GB DDR2""The ram itself has ""2 x 1024"" on each stick's labels, I'm sure this denotes that each stick is one of a pair.Does this mean that Amazon gets to keep my shipping when I return this mislabeled ram?Get it together.Annoyed"
4,rippin' fast memory for my quad core...,Used in my high end DIY build along with a Q6600 and (2) 8800GTXs. Only concern was that the 680i mobo did not say that this memory was SLI ready. Other than that...everything about the memory was great for OC-ing and performance.
4,Super Ram,I have to Return One Module as it Does Not Work- but I bought 2 More and They Kick in OverClock Mode!
5,Pleasurable pianism,"The risk-taking young Noriko Ogawa is a golden pianist. She records whole movements in single takes, and is best known for her Rachmaninov. Her rich tone, superb control, and stylistic sensitivity is fully captured on this BIS disk.Despite the title this is a ""classical"" sampler rather than pop music. Most of the 11 Japanese composers featured here worked with European forms or styles--between 1900 and 1981, in a huge gamut of styles ranging from Chopinesque to modern dissonant--but there is a notable tendency to incorporate lovely native pentatonal scales, especially in music from the nationalistic 1930s. The overall feeling is mostly calming and nocturnal, rather like Carol Rosenberger's selection of impressionist ""Night Moods"" on Delos 3030. Informative notes to composers mostly unknown here are included."
5,This is the clearest explanation I have ever read..,The strength of this book is that it aligns history with scripture and they agree. Wonderful detailed explanations of the books of Daniel and Revelation. I would recommend to any serious student of the Bible.
2,yes it's clear... if you agree with his position,"The layperson may get more out of this than students and scholars as this commentary attempts to rewrite the text in ""understandable"" language. By reading the title it is apparent that he takes a firm stance on the fourth kingdom as Rome. He doesnt comment on any other kind of reading and makes statements about uncertainties within the text as if they were inalienable truths."
4,Provocative,"Uriah Smith, who lived and wrote over a century ago, has offered present day readers additional food-for-thought from the past about our institutional religions. Have they truly freed men, or enslaved them? Smith suggests a little of both and has provided us with an excellent read in this era of Dan Brown and the Da Vinci Code."
2,it was different...,"I know this is a low budget movie but...The acting is rather bland. Some of the actors seem bored with their role. Also the scene with the three teenagers (two female, one male) speaking about how large they are/like it to be is rather...well the acting is so bad it really should have been left out. The first half of the movie is rather slow considering it shows one sexual encounter after another until the two main characters meet.The movie does show some interesting techniques to ummm deal with the main characters' issues but aside from a few of those we found rather funny (and I am not sure they were ment to be funny) that was pretty much all we got out of it. So we gave it one star for the humor and the other star was for the view from her vagina. That was indeed a first for us.We watched it and it wasn't something we enjoyed enough to watch again. I would rather watch Someone's Knocking at the Door again."
3,One sick movie!,You have to go to Divine or ANdy Warhole to find a sicker movie. I recomend it highly for showing in frat houses.
5,brilliant period performances,"These recordings have changed my opinion of Mozart's sonatas. Brautigam uses a copy of a 1795 fortepiano with spectacular results. The attack of this instrument is much more defined, which makes these pieces come alive. His tempos are fast, which adds to the energy and excitement of these performances. Recording quality is superb, and the price is a true value. I used to think Mozart's sonatas were sluggish and not of the same caliber of much of his other compositions (Haydn's sonatas seemed to sparkle in comparison). With this set, I have changed my mind... truly first class."
3,A Guilty Pleasure,"One of the best Krokus albums, with some of the funniest metal tunes ever. How can you not howl over silliness like ""Long Stick Goes Boom,"" ""Bad Boys, Rag Dolls"" or the classic ""Down The Drain"" with lyrics like ""My mother was a b-girl, my old man was a tramp/Some folks say they conceived me on a loading ramp."" I guess life's rough over there in Switzerland!I don't take Krokus too seriously, never did. Krokus is all about goofy fun, and that's a good thing, but the band has chops, too. They sound a lot like AC/DC, but funnier. This is good rock and roll. It'll keep your head banging and put a smile on your face.Remember, folks, three stars is a good review. If all the songs were as good as the ones I've mentioned above, it would get five."
5,The Best Album AC/DC Never Recorded!,"To be fair, only five of the nine songs on ONE VICE AT A TIME are blatantly in the AC/DC style. But they are so good that it doesn't matter. Every song on OVAAT is great (if you like straight-ahead no-frills Hard Rock). Krokus covered ""American Woman"" on this album 17 years before Lenny Kravitz recorded his version, and the Krokus' version is better. ""Long Stick Goes Boom,"" ""Playin' The Outlaw,"" ""To The Top,"" and ""Save Me"" are all as good or better than most of AC/DC's material, so the stylistic borrowing can be forgiven (and forgotten - by the next album Krokus had adopted an AC/DC meets Judas Priest style). The band was both criticized for the lack of originality, and praised for the quality of the music when this album came out, and both observations are valid. Krokus' other albums may have been hit or miss when it came to quality, but this one is a CLASSIC! -(If you like ONE VICE... try Def Leppard's HIGH AND DRY and AC/DC's FLICK OF THE SWITCH)"
2,Far from their best,"""One vice at time"" is a very rattling album - too noisy and too loud. Maybe they all (band, producer, record company) thought this is how heavy metal should sound like, but I strongly believe they kind of destroyed many good song with this production. The previous ""Hardware"" is so much better, even if ""One vice at a time"" includes the great ""Playing the outlaw"", ""Down the drain"" (a song with high potential), and a good cover choice in ""American woman"".... This album is nonetheless mostly for dedicated Krokus fans."
1,AC/DC clones,"Krokus is nothing more than a cheap and unashamed copy of AC/DC. IN this album, the singer even tries to duplicate Brian Johnson's roars! It's absurd!"
4,Book Report Lyka Reyes,"This is an interesting book for people who like to learn more about turtles. It talks about how they migrate. How they lay eggs, and how they are becoming extinct. It has photographs of real sea turtles. I recommend this book to everyone specially for people who loves turtles."
1,Not worthy of its predecessor,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the first book in the trilogy, Charming the Highlander, I was very disappointed in this follow up. The first book was imaginative, fast-paced, with a complex hero torn between his medieval roots and the need to adapt to the modern world in order to survive. This 2nd book, however, features a hero who still acts as if he lives in the 13th century, a heroine whose obsession with her scarred back makes her extremely one dimensional, and a plot that's yawn-inducing. If this book is any indication, I'll have to think extremely hard before putting my money down for the final book in the trilogy."
3,Not unique,"I have read all three books in this series, and they pretty much repeat them selves. A group of Scottish warriors from the 12th century get pulled forward in time by a wizard. They all meet (in the 3 books) 21st century woman and fall in love. The characters have no depth, the storyline just doesn't hold together. To many events are always happening together to try to make the story interesting, but they don't. They just seem haphazard, and all this action takes away from the characters. Instead of giving them a personality so the reader can understand their actions, Chapman throws them into strange adventures, and you don't understand why they act the way they do.Not the best, just superficial. Try instead a Julie Garwood book, or any Christina Dodd."
1,one hundred miles of bad road,I looked forward to a description of this little talked about segment of the Vietnam war. I was disappointed that there was little of the daily life of a tanker and the flow of the book made it a hard read. I would not recommend it although there is little else out there on the subject.
5,A Great Early 80's Compliation!,"This CD includes 17 rockin' classics by one of Europe's most under-rated Metal Bands! All tracks are remasters from the original studio recordings. It is a good mix of hits from Metal Rendez-Vous, Hardware, One Vice at a Time, and Headhunter. This one is great for the ""classic"" Krokus fan. That is, before they got ""poppish"" in the mid-80's. The quote on the back cover puts it the best - ""May some of these songs be remembered for what they stand: Pure Rock 'n Roll juice for the hearts of our fans."""
4,rockin,didn't know what i was missing when i was younger. my xm radio is a bad influence on this old soul ;)
5,The best album AC/DC never did,"This sounds just like Bon Scott era AC/DC but with stronger guitar hooks, sing along lyrics, and tons of energy. These are the Von Arb/Von Ruhr era classics like ""Bad Boys"", ""Headhunter"", ""Long Stick"" and ""Heatstrokes"" this has all the great Krokus songs. Only knock is the cover tunes that really are not that great but are what Krokus is known for, which is a shame. A teriffic car CD."
3,In Praise of Fingleton,"You should read this book because it runs counter to the long line of ""new age information society"" books that have come out since ""the Third Wave"" by Alvin Toffler. Since the 80's (and rise of Microsoft) it has been fashionable to push software as the future, and Fingleton tackles that myth with gusto! It's also important to keep in mind that the author wrote this book before the internet bubble burst on the stock market, which gives me even more respect for the book.As someone working in the software business I found that Fingleton has some blind spots and can go a bit too far, but he still has a voice that should be heard. While the book has some flaws (I didn't find all the information on target) it still opened some doors for me and made me think, and that alone is a good reward for any reader."
3,Something of a disappointment after Hang On For Your Life,"I thought that Shooting Star was poised on the brink of REO Speedwagon-like success after the brilliant Hang On For Your Life set, but III Wishes turned out to be a fairly weak follow up and the band never really recovered. Not a bad album, but definitely not one to make the crossover from AOR to mainstream. Are You Ready, Heartache and Do You Feel Alright were all songs that made my personal ""best of"" set, with Whole World's Watching as a pinch hitter, but little else on the album came close to anything on the previous album."
3,"3.5 stars: music for a rainy mood, whatever the weather","A very decent collection of pleasant and, sometimes, even stirring pieces. The performance on a CD like this is critical in learning to appreciate such short pieces of broad appeal as more than radio filler. Pontinen does well, conveying mood as much as fine technique throughout. The Liszt nocturnes, the Scarlatti, and the Rachmaninov pieces are spaced well to make the program varied and memorable."
3,Her Gym Style workouts are boring,"I've done all of Cathe's DVDs and kept the ones I love (most of them actually), but not this one. I don't know why everyone else likes the Gym Style series so much, maybe because of the catchy title. I find this workout boring and too slow-paced. The music is not worth mentioning. Too many push-ups (72!). Cathe has a lot better stuff than this. I also don't like to spend 50 minutes on just 2 body parts, because I think the time can be used more efficiently."
2,not so good,"worst of the WH& WH40k line of games by far. While not totally lacking, it isn't good for much more than a rainy day."
2,Are you kidding me.,"Thought it would be an interesting read. I had trouble getting through the first chapter. I wouldn't have had such a hard time if the author would pick a position and stand with it. The flaws in his logic and his conclusions were too obvious not to laugh at. For example Bloom says ""this Jewish spiritual genius [Jesus]"" then in the next paragraph says ""We again know nothing verifiable about what Jesus taught."" How do you qualify the opinion that he was a spiritual genius if you don't have a clue what he taught?Bloom does like to use big words which was great. I like the fact that I had to go to the dictionary a couple of times to make sure I was getting what he was saying.The best part about this book is that it proves anyone out there can get published."
1,nothing too new here,"Regrettably I would say that the basic conclusions Bloom arrives at about the three major ""characters"" are probably not all that different from those a typical agnostic, for instance, might arrive at from simply reading the Bible straight through, viewing it partly as a work of literature, partly as a series of documents with theological purpose. Bloom's elaboration of the ideas of course makes you think a lot, but not too long into this book, I realized it would not do much more than toss around thoughts I had mostly already had."
1,AN ATHEIST INCOGNITO,"Professor Bloom perhaps is one of the top 5 literary critics in the U.S.,but in religion, he is a ""magnificent failure"" [ actual words he uses to describe St.Augustine!]. Though we still read St.Augustine 1,578 years after his passing, Bloom will not fare so well. Such a mess this book is, the evidence that a securalist-turned-atheist used the word ""Jesus"" to sell the book is overwhelming. Bloom is never dull, but he can be wrong. Buy a book by St. Augustine instead!"
5,Bloom Forever,"Critics of this book find deep fault with Bloom's grasp of Biblical history, research, archaeology, and biblical scholasticism in general. Bloom's mission here it seems to me is to apply critical thinking to the writings of the Christian New Testament. Bloom airs his own ideas in a kind of poetic, Joycean stream, and at the same time, points out the very many contraditions and oddities that the various authors of the books of the bible indulge in. Bloom is the anti-Sunday school teacher--as children we are taught to simply accept Biblical teachings without thought or critical thinking. As educated adults, Bloom leads us on a field trip through the Bible, focusing on Yahweh, Jesus, and bringing in his old favorite, Hamlet, as a talking point--Bloom's wide, deep and ferocious grasp of western civilization, literature, and critical thinking inspire the reader to question, argue, and re-think his or her fondly held beliefs regarding the Jesus of the gospels. An invaluable work."
5,Important for our Time,"This book is, in my opinion, the culmination of Harold Bloom's career. I haven't read everything of his, by any means. But to me it seems that everything he has done has pointed at last to this book, an examination of the ""anxiety of influence"" of the New Testament misreading the Old Testament and significantly and violently imposing this misreading on what has become the ""American Religion.""Indeed, I can't think of any American Christian who could read this book with an open mind. By Bloom's own account, this book may be ""an elegy for Yahweh,"" the complex and contradictory character of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) who has been reduced to ""God the Father,"" by the revisions of political and theological influences throughout the Common Era.If only more people would read and understand this book..."
2,Difficult,"Unless you have spent the past thirty years studying theology AND Shakespeare, you won't have a clue what Bloom is talking about. He is clearly writing to himself here. It's like reading someone elses' diary.This is a work by a very successful author who no longer has to care about his audience."
4,good information and helpful,Helpful and good information this book will get you up and running with scanners in no time.
3,Good for dogs,"I got it because my vet told me to. First used it didn't do anything. After a week or so it started do do the job. Have to follow the instructions all the way. First week wasn't leaving it on log enought. After rereading it left it on longer. That worked great no more scratching dogs. ""Talk to you vet before using it.."" It may be another problem."
4,Terrific for Dogs allergies,"Wow, money savings is awesome compared to vet's prices and the size is tremendous! Kept our dogs skin allergies from acting up, after we used it originally to clear his skin up to begin with! Alas he passed away from old age but have told others of the terrific desl for this pet shampoo!"
3,Douxo Chlorhexidine PS shampoo,Haven't used because my dog's hot spot cleared but this came highly recommended by a breeder friend who works at a vet. I also so the product at my vet (after I purchased from Amazone) and it is way cheaper here! I think it is good to have on hand.
3,Be sure you are using Frontline first,"My sheltie suffered from a disgusting skin condition and my vet had me use this soap on her. I was using a fleadrops from Walmart. Once I went to Frontline, my dog's skin condition completely cleared up. So be sure that your dog is on Frontline before you spend money on this product, because in fact your dog could be in a state of torture by microscopic bugs that the Frontline will kill. I repeat, my dog's skin condition completely repaired itself and is GONE. This product was not part of the cure. I'm not saying that it won't help your dog, but I think that Frontline is a step that the vet assumed I was using and sadly, I was not. I also had another dog who had rashes all over his genital area. Once we put him on Frontline, that rash disappeared too. He never was bathed in this shampoo. This said, the shampoo smells nice and is a quality product."
5,Great Product for Itchy Dogs,"My dog has bad allergies, particularly to dust mites, and this shampoo works well to combat itchy skin. We've tried a lot of different products and this one is one of the best."
4,My medicated shampoo,"My Dermatologist suggested this for my allergies and skin problems.It works well to control my outbreaks but it is expensive.I have to use the ""leave on"" solution too and my owner putson this fatty acid stuff too. It doesn't dry out my skin likeregular shampoo. This should not be used just for someone whojust has dry itchy skin, it is antispetic and kills yeast bacteriawhich feeds on my body oil.Tora the Chihuahua"
5,Great product,I have a handicapped yorkie and he wears a diaper for 8 years now and this product is a godsend. He gets black skin and this softens it and keeps it very soft. Love it!
3,Education Through Disaster,"In 1986, a nuclear disaster rocked the Soviet Union. ""Final Warning"" is a chronological look at the cause and effects of that tragedy. It focuses primarily on the doctors who rushed to battle the effects of the radiation. Smartly directed, ""Final Warning"" is a sad and educational depiction of history."
4,This book is a must have for any avid horror/Johnstone fan!!,"Them is classic Johnstone! It is very easy reading and once you start it is hard to put down. It has all the monsters(both human and nonhuman), sex and violence that one comes to expect in Johnstone's tales of horror."
2,pendant,"You get what you pay for! the pendent is tiny. i knew that and that is fine. i didn't want a big one. it is beautiful and wears well. the only complaint i have is the chain is too thin. i have to be so very careful because if it gets caught on anything, it will just break. It really does concern me so i will have to buy another one when i find it that i think is more sterdy that won't break as easy. don't expect anything huge!"
3,"Nice, but chain is weak","I believe the title says it all.Basically, the necklace is quite nice, and my girlfriend was very pleased to recieve it. The stones are not exactly big, so make sure you understand how much .15 cttw is. But they are big enough to be seen at least.The chain itself however, lacks. It was too weak to last 2 weeks. So if you do buy this, make sure that she wears it only sparingly, or buy a heavier chain."
2,TOO SMALL!!!,"I wish that I had paid more attention to the size in the description. It is much smaller than I had hoped for. Considering the ""original"" price, I had expected something a little bigger. I'll be much more careful in the future."
2,You get what you pay for,"The picture you see is slightly decieving. The item is small and the chain is weak. It is worth the $49 I paid for it. Not a great deal by any means. If I would have paid the list price, i'd be talking to Amazons refund dept."
1,not satisfied,"I have sent the necklace back several weeks ago and I have not heard a reply, gotten my money back NOTHING!! I would like my money back please!!!"
4,One of the better soyjoy bars,"I'm a big fan of soyjoy as an at-work snack. They're a little smaller than most energy bars, with only 130 calories each. While the ""value"" for the money may be less, I find that this bar is a better size than some of the larger alternatives.Of the flavors I have tried I would rank them in order as:1) strawberry2) apple3) berry4) mango coconut"
1,gross,"I don't know which flavor I ate, but it was gross and I couldn't finish it. Yes, I like the taste of tofu and soy but these were just not good. Hard and dry and no real taste. Do yourself a favor and buy an Odwalla Bar or Larabar instead (especially if you are buying just because soyjoy is gluten free, so are larabars and they actually taste good!)"
1,"Boring, Tasteless, Unfulfilling Snack","I am sure SoyJoy is a pretty healthy snack. It's made with whole soy and dried fruit. But it has absolutely no taste whatsoever. It is a very boring, tasteless, unfulfilling snack. I prefer grains or granola that fills you up a little bit and has a little flavor compared to this pretty bland soy/fruit bar."
1,1 star is too many,"These things are the most horrible, foul things I've ever tasted. I agree that they taste like dirt - dirt with an aftertaste."
1,Emergency Responder Light,"Emergency Responder LightAs an EMT it is important to get to the patient as-soon-as-possible. A good light that can be seen by other vehicles (so they can get out of the way) is important, and this light does no do the trick very well. The magnet is strong enough to stay on my automobile without shifting but it will leave small scratches in the paint. The plug that goes into the car outlet is difficult to pull out and it broke after a few days. The price from Amazon is quite good. The manufacture is charging about four times as much."
3,NOT AUBREY MATURIN,"AS A WORSHIPPER OF O'BRIAN FOR HIS AUBREY-MATURIN SERIES IN ITS ENTIRETY - I'VE WANTED TO EXPERIENCE HIS OTHER WORK. CLEARLY THIS MR. BANKS' NATURALISTIC BENT, AND OBRIAN'S IN-DEPTH INTEREST IN FATHOMING THE MAN'S JOURNALS, REFLECTS OR MAYBE INFORMS THE CHARACTER OF DR.

5,excellent biography,The book is clearly written and filled with information about the time and place of its subject.

2,Got $45 to burn?,"The translations are crude at best. While I didn't expect a perfect translation, I did expect the program to perform simple sentence structures. Fortunately, I know the language I was translating. If you're looking to get a translation program that will give you the gist of what is said, then this is for you. If you're looking for a translation program that will place nouns, verbs, adverbs, etc. in the correct order, then don't waste your money unless you know the language and you have $45 to burn."
1,Unexcited buyer,"The name really fooled me! EASY TRANSLATOR. Maybe it is easy for computer programmers but it wasn't to me, a neophyte. Using their help menu is very difficult due to it's lack of a glossary and it's treatise on ""how to"". Their on-line help was also a great disappointment, in their eyes, maybe I should not be using a computer. I am well versed in AutoCad and Excel, but I did pay a little more for those programs. For the rest of the seniors, either go back to school or get a good language dictionary and do it the EASY way."
4,Good and from Canada,"They're just good and deserve more attention. The vocals are very similar to Bono(U2)and music sound like OLD Radiohead albums (Pablo Honey era which is pretty different from what they are doing now). Honestly, I always think it""s Hawksley Workman (another great canadian) when I hear a song on the radio, they both have something about Bono in their voice.Nice buy."
5,Album of the Year,"This is an awesome cd! A must buy! I heard their single ""into your hideout"" on the radio and from then on new they would be a hit! I hear a lot of reference to them sounding like best selling bands such as Coldplay, Radiohead, and Travis - but I contend they have a sound of their own. However, if your a fan of those aforementioned bands, you'll definetly enjoy this album! There is not a single bad song on it and after hearing the cd over 50 times, the songs still haven't become tiring! Great CD, my album of the year for 2003, and a great live band to watch if you ever get a chance!"
3,Huh?!,"How is this possible?! It is released almost at the same time as ""Hopes and Fears"" from Keane, and it almost sound exactly the same as that record?!!It has good songs, but it is not more than nice."
5,Fun for a group of kids,"I got this for my daughters third birthday party. It was a must have for her in my home fall bash. The kids enjoyed it, and so did some of the adults."
5,British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) review May 4th 2002,"A review of recordings of Sibelius' 4th symphony, on CD masters on the BBC on Saturday May 4th, brought this recording out top (of about 10-15 that were considered). The reviewer considered the depths of loneliness and despair reached were remarkable!. More info on the BBC website."
5,Horus toy,"Horus, was purchased for my 5 year old nephew who is an Egyptomanic! Horus is his favorite member of the Egyptian Pantheon, so I looked around for a toy version for him. He loves the toy and I would rather him play with an educational action figure. I wish he was flexible but he is still very cool. the item arrived very fast and was exactly as described."
1,just doesn't stay lit,"This seemed like a good idea for an original oil I purchased, but the darn thing just doesn't work worth a hoot. Save your money on this brand!"
2,Quit Bothering,This light looks nice but the batteries needed changed too often. I finally just quit bothering with it.
5,Phenomenal Lecuona from begining to end,"The playing on this disc is tremendous. From begining to end, I was in awe of Tirino. Not only a big technique: beautiful sound, long depth of phrasing, full spectrum of interpretation. And authentically Cuban to a fault. His liner notes are extremely imformative and show his monumental research as well about this music. The Rumba Rhapsody with an original Spanish lyric by Tirino is amazing: it is SO Cuban and stylistic correct! What a find. I'm buying the rest of the discs in this series."
4,"It's good for learning the basics, but that's it","I'm currently covering the book, the presentation of the material is straightforward, the author gets you up and running with a project as early as chapter 2 - granted that the degree of difficulty varies chapter to chapter.Again, don't expect anything more than a ""tour"" of Flash, more in depth books are available. The reason I started with this book is to gain familiarity with the tools of Flash, get working on a quick project, and then advance to other books/training sources.Overall, it's not 5 worthy, but I'll give it a 4 since it does a good job of giving me the upper-level details of FlashMX and ActionScript."
1,$$$ for this? I don't think so.,"I understand tutorials for recent software releases may have their fair share of typos, but the editors at Peachpit were asleep at the wheel on this one. Not only is this book filled with typos, I found this to be more of a brain dump than a professional, organized tutorial. We are asked to read pages and pages of the most mundane concepts and wordy explanations, and then are left out in the cold when it gets down and dirty -- key steps and definitions are just missed entirely. The first animation lessons are totally inconsistent and vague, and then the author goes so far to say ""by now you're an expert!"" Right. I am very disappointed in my first Macromedia-sanctioned tutorial, I expected better. Their products aren't very intuitive, I don't know why their tutorial publications would be."
2,Not for beginners,"For those who are beginners with flash, i don't think that this is the right book for them as it is a bit complicated and boring especially when you reach the action scripting.For those who would like to learn flash in a simpler way, i do not recommend this book."
3,A good book for People Who Never Even Seen Flash.,"This book was very useful but it on ly though me a couple new things. Half of the book is useless cuz it only shows what action scripting is, it doesn't explane how u can use it. It just gives u one project to do and it mainly tells u how to design a web site, and doesn't teah u how to make a movie.If you want to lean flash just to make ur own movies or games then don't buy this book, if u want to learn how to make a 2cent site the this is the perfect book for you. This is a great stepping stone into the world of flash, that describes every little thing as if it was talking to a 2 year old, it doesn't teach you one thing about how to make a movie or a game. You should get something more advanced. This is just a first step, and a wast of 32 bucks."
2,So so...,"Bought this book by the title thinking that I would get hands on experience as the extremely helpful ""Adobe Classroom in a Book"" books but unfortunately, this book is too preocupied in following VERY specific steps to create a simple and rather boring site and does not offer the opportunity to learn about what Flash can really do."
2,"No longer being supported, can't finish lessons","A warning to prospective buyers:This book is only three years old, but the server that runs the scripts neccessary for you to finish the lessons won't run the scripts and appears to no longer be supported. Not only that, it looks like the author never actually finished the site. There are references there to tutorials that were supposed to have been put on the site years ago, which like the files your lessons are supposed to access, are simply not there.Up through Lesson 8, I thought the book was fine and thought it did a nice job of teaching a fairly tricky subject. The lack of follow-through has really killed it though as the site that you are building simply can't be fully built. Not a nice thing to find out 2/3 into the project."
2,Good only up to lesson 8,"Folks, this book is great, however, don't expect to get past lesson 8. Beginning in Lesson 9, the PHP/server tutorial simply fails to deliver. The author/publisher are extrement difficult to reach via e-mail (actually, no one ever replied at all). I've posted a request errata sheet on actionscript forums, macromedia.com, google forum, you name it....still no answer.Buy only if you're not interested in learning dynamic content."
2,overview of mx,"I usually enjoy From the Source books, but this one gave me a ""thrown together at the last minute"" feel. The book uses a zoo site which lacks ""umf"". It just doesn't sizzle at all. Chissy attempts to give an overview and you just feel like you are reading another technical manual. The treatment of actionscript is... well abrupt. She covers functions, variables, loops, syntax and other important issues in less than 4 pages.Your head will definitely spin on that one.There are some good points in terms of resources and an overview of Flash features, but this text was worse in its treatment of Flash as a tutorial. Further it is has several errors and inconsistencies in the content. Again, you feel someone was in a hurry to put this together and missed putting together something you can enjoy learning from."
2,old material recycled,"i've been an axe fan since the old club days in the '80s and have seen them dozens of times. During this time fans have passed around copies of demos that the band had not officially released.most of these were remastered and released as ""fields of yesterday"", which was a great album because you knew what to expect. In ""waters rising"" there are only 3 new songs and the rest are re-performed demo songs that had not made ""fields of yesterday"". so most of this, while good, is not new materialindicative of a band on the way out. Blaze has other projects he is working on and has thrown us Lillian Axe fans a bone with this album (only he is from the original lillian axe lineup)If you're looking for the ""true"" lillan axe sound try ""poetic justice"" or ""love and war"", this CD's is only for die-hard fans"
2,Disappointed,"Guess I'm going to be the sour grape in this list of reviews. This book was a bitter disappointment to me. I am a ""dog person"" and an avid fan of dog mysteries and always pounce on the latest one I find. ""Scent of Murder"" starts with what seems the completely gratuitous death of an SAR dog, but never fear, the heroine just happens to have a second fully trained dog in reserve. There are too many unnecessary flips of viewpoint and too many minor characters throwing bits of their lives at the reader. At one point a dog is hit by a skunk full in the face and yet it ""scents"" something again that same day - I live in the country and know what it's like for a dog to get skunked full in the face and I just plain don't believe it, nor do I believe a serial killer of children would get hung up on an adult woman. If this turns into a series, maybe it will improve, but as of right now I'm sorry so many people seem to have such low standards for a mystery based on canine search and rescue."
4,Good suspenseful mystery,"This is a good read for the dog & mystery enthusiast. It's about a vengeful father who's target is children of people who've betrayed him, and it's up to a search-and-rescue team leader and her dogs to find the missing children before they meet their demise; as well as their own in the end.Well detailed and is filled with action from front to end cover."
5,I just finished my 7th reading ...,"This is an excellent suspense novel that draws you into the life of Brenna Scott and her K-9 search and rescue team. I picked up this book on a bargain rack and upon opening it was immediately drawn into a life touched by sadness, comfort, laughter and hope. If you are a dog lover, as I am, you'll shed tears, but you'll also smile at the mental pictures drawn by Cynthia Alwyn's pen of the bond between trainer and dog; you'll also live the suspense of the search and rescue. This is a wonderful book and I am anxiously awaiting the next."
3,"And for my 200th review...an average thriller, but focused on search and rescue dogs...","Cynthia Alwyn doesn't do too badly with her debut novel, but everything about it is obvious average to mediocre. The villain is too cartoonishly bad with almost silly taunting messages and ""Oh, I am so clever of a serial killer, so I'll give you just enough infoformation to find out who I really am"" e-mails. The heroine isn't really memorable either, and has an obligatory boyfriend that never appears in the novel, just so we don't have the heroine and the dogged lawman get together. Alwyn definately know her stuff though about dogs and search and rescue so at least that had an aura of reality."
4,Now's the time to collect,"""I owe you one."" Words spoken out of gratitude by landscape architect Dana Rollins. Little did she know it was a debt that Jared Westmoreland planned to collect in full.Divorce attorney Jared has witnessed so many happily ever afters turn into disasters. He feels marriage is not for him. But as the oldest of six boys and with the sting of recent marriages of his cousins, the pressure is on. Mother Westmoreland wants a daughter-in-law and grandbabies yesterday! To appease his mother, Jared along with the help of Dana come up with an elaborate plan to pretend to be an engaged couple. But who is fooling who? Will this divorce attorney have a new outlook on marriage?Ms. Brenda has outdone herself again! I can't wait for some more Westmoreland."
5,"Jared""s counterfeit Fiancee(silhourttr Desire)",Good god !!!!! the man in this book were is HE!!! love is great thanks for this book.
